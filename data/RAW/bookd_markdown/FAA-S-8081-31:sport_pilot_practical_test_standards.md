# INTRODUCTION  

# General Information  

The Flight Standards Service of the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) has developed this practical test book as the standard that  must be used by FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners  (DPEs), when conducting sport pilot and flight instructor with a sport  pilot rating practical tests or proficiency checks.  

The word “examiner” is used throughout the standards to denote either  the FAA inspector or an FAA designated pilot examiner who conducts  an official practical test or proficiency check. When an examiner  conducts a proficiency check they are acting in the capacity of an  authorized instructor.  

A proficiency check is an evaluation of aeronautical knowledge and  flight proficiency IAW Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) part 61, section 61.321 or 61.419. A proficiency check must be  administered using the appropriate practical test standard (PTS) for the  category of aircraft when a pilot or a flight instructor adds new  category/class privileges. Upon successful completion of the proficiency  check the authorized instructor will endorse the applicant’s logbook  indicating the added category/class of equipment that the applicant is  authorized to operate. When an examiner conducts a proficiency check  they are acting in the capacity of an authorized instructor.  

DPEs must have designation authority to conduct sport pilot initial  evaluations (Sport Pilot Examiner [SPE]) and flight instructor with a  sport pilot rating initial evaluations (Sport Pilot Flight Instructor  Examiner [SFIE]) per FAA Order 8710.7, Sport Pilot Examiner’s  Handbook.  

Authorized instructors must use this PTS when preparing applicants for  practical tests or proficiency checks and when conducting proficiency  checks. Applicants should be familiar with this book and refer to these  standards during their training.  

Information considered directive in nature is described in this practical  test book in terms, such as “shall” and “must” indicating the actions are  mandatory. Guidance information is described in terms, such as  “should” and “may” indicating the actions are desirable or permissive,  but not mandatory.  

The FAA gratefully acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by  many individuals and organizations throughout the aviation community  who contributed their time and talent in assisting with the development  of this practical test standard.  

This PTS may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents,  U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20402-9325,  or from http://bookstore.gpo.gov. This PTS is also available for  download, in pdf format, from the Flight Standards Service web site at  www.faa.gov.  

The U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration,  Airman Testing Standards Branch, AFS-630, P.O. BOX 25082,  Oklahoma City, OK 73125 publishes this PTS. Comments regarding  this PTS should be sent, in e-mail form, to AFS630comments@faa.gov.  

# Practical Test Standards Concept  

14 CFR part 61.311 specifies the AREAS OF OPERATION in which  knowledge and skill must be demonstrated by the applicant before the  issuance of a Sport Pilot Certificate or privileges. The CFRs provide the  flexibility to permit the FAA to publish practical test standards  containing the AREAS OF OPERATION and specific TASKs in which  pilot competency must be demonstrated. The FAA must revise this  practical test standard whenever it is determined that changes are  needed in the interest of safety.  Adherence to the provisions of the  regulations and the practical test standards is mandatory for  practical tests and proficiency checks.  

# Practical Test Book Description  

This test book contains the following Sport Pilot Practical Test  Standards.  

Section 1—Weight Shift Control  Section 2—Powered Parachute  Section 3—Flight Instructor (The flight instructor section contains a  separate introduction in section 3.)  

The Sport Pilot Practical Test Standards include the AREAS OF  OPERATION and TASKs for the issuance of an initial Sport Pilot  Certificate and for the addition of sport pilot category/class privileges. It  also contains information on how to obtain an initial Flight Instructor  Certificate with a sport pilot rating and for the addition of flight instructor  category/class privileges.  

# Practical Test Standards Description  

AREAS OF OPERATION are phases of the practical test or proficiency  check arranged in a logical sequence within each standard. They begin  with Preflight Preparation and end with Postflight Procedures. The  examiner may conduct the practical test or proficiency check in any  sequence that will result in a complete and efficient test. An authorized  instructor may conduct a proficiency check in any sequence that will  result in a complete and efficient test.  However, the ground portion of  the practical test or proficiency check must be accomplished  before the flight portion.  

TASKs are specific knowledge areas, flight procedures, or maneuvers  appropriate to an AREA OF OPERATION. The abbreviation(s) within  parentheses immediately following a TASK refer to the appropriate class  of aircraft. The meaning of each class abbreviation is as follows:  

WSCL  Weight Shift Control—Land  WSCS  Weight Shift Control—Sea  PPCL  Powered Parachute—Land  PPCS  Powered Parachute—Sea  

When administering a test using section 1, 2, or 3 of this PTS, the TASKs  appropriate to the class aircraft (WSCL, WSCS, PPCL, and PPCS) used  for the test must be included in the plan of action. The absence of a class  indicates the TASK is for all classes.  

NOTE is used to emphasize special considerations required in the  AREA OF OPERATION or TASK.  

REFERENCE identifies the publication(s) that describe(s) the TASK.  Descriptions of TASKs are not included in these standards because this  information can be found in the current issue of the listed reference.  Publications other than those listed may be used for reference if their  content conveys substantially the same meaning as the referenced  publications.  

These practical test standards are based on the following references.

# Use of the Practical Test Standards Book  

The FAA requires that all sport pilot and sport pilot flight instructor practical  tests and proficiency checks be conducted in accordance with the  appropriate sport pilot practical test standards and the policies set forth in  this INTRODUCTION. Applicants must be evaluated in  ALL  TASKs included  in each AREA OF OPERATION of the appropriate practical test standard,  unless otherwise noted.  

An applicant, who holds at least a Sport Pilot Certificate seeking additional  aircraft category/class privileges at the sport pilot level, must be evaluated  in all the AREAS OF OPERATION and TASKs listed in the PTS.  

In preparation for each practical test or proficiency check, the examiner or  authorized instructor must develop a written “plan of action.” The “plan of  action” must include all TASKs in each AREA OF OPERATION, unless  noted otherwise. If the elements in one TASK have already been evaluated  in another TASK, they need not be repeated.  

For example, the “plan of action” need not include evaluating the applicant  on complying with markings at the end of the flight, if that element was  sufficiently observed at the beginning of the flight.  Any TASK selected for  evaluation during a practical test or proficiency check must be  evaluated in its entirety.  Exception: examiners evaluating single-seat  applicants from the ground must evaluate only those TASK  elements  that  can be accurately assessed from the ground.  

The examiner or authorized instructor is not required to follow the precise  order in which the AREAS OF OPERATION and TASKs appear in this  book. The examiner or authorized instructor may change the sequence or  combine TASKs with similar Objectives to have an orderly and efficient flow  of the practical test or proficiency check events.  

The examiner’s or authorized instructor’s “plan of action” must include the  order and combination of TASKs to be demonstrated by the applicant in a  manner that will result in an efficient and valid test.  

The examiner or authorized instructor is expected to use good judgment in  the performance of simulated emergency procedures. The use of the safest  means for simulation is expected. Consideration must be given to local  conditions, both meteorological and topographical, at the time of the test,  as well as the applicant’s workload, and the condition of the aircraft used  during the practical test or proficiency check.  If the procedure being  evaluated would jeopardize safety, it is expected that the applicant  will simulate that portion of the maneuver.  

# Special Emphasis Areas  

Examiners and authorized instructors must place special emphasis upon  areas of aircraft operations considered critical to flight safety. Among these  are:  

1.  positive aircraft control;  2.  procedures for positive exchange of flight controls;  3.  stall and spin awareness (if appropriate);  4.  collision avoidance;  5.  wake turbulence and low level wind shear avoidance;  6.  runway incursion avoidance;  7.  controlled flight into terrain (CFIT);  8.  aeronautical decision making/risk management;  9.  checklist usage;  10.    spatial disorientation;  11.    temporary flight restrictions (TFR);  12.    special use airspace (SUA);  13.    aviation security; and  14.    other areas deemed appropriate to any phase of the practical test  or proficiency check.  

Although these areas may not be specifically addressed under each  TASK, they are essential to flight safety and will be evaluated during  the practical test or proficiency check. In all instances, the applicant’s  actions will be evaluated in accordance to the standards of the TASKs  and the ability to use good judgment with reference to the special  emphasis areas listed above.  

# Sport Pilot—Practical Test Prerequisites (Initial)  

An applicant for a Sport Pilot Certificate is required by 14 CFR part 61  to:  

1.    be at least 17 years of age (or 16 if applying to operate a glider  or balloon);  2.    be able to read, speak, write, and understand the English  language. If there is a doubt, use AC 60-28, English Language  Skill Standards;  3.    have passed the appropriate sport pilot knowledge test since  the beginning of the 24th month before the month in which he or  she takes a practical test;  4.    have satisfactorily accomplished the required training and  obtained the aeronautical experience prescribed;  5.    possess a current and valid U.S. driver’s license or a valid  Airman Medical Certificate issued under 14 CFR part 67;  6.    have an endorsement from an authorized instructor certifying  that the applicant has received and logged training time within  60 days preceding the date of application in preparation for the  practical test, and is prepared for the practical test; and  7.    have an endorsement certifying that the applicant has  demonstrated satisfactory knowledge of the subject areas in  which the applicant was deficient on the airman knowledge test.  

# Sport Pilot—Practical Test Prerequisites (Registered Ultra-Light  Pilots)  

If you are a registered ultra-light pilot with an FAA-recognized ultra-light  organization on or before September 1, 2004, and you want to apply for  a Sport Pilot Certificate, then you must, not later than January 31, 2007  (14 CFR part 61, section 61.329):  

1.    meet the eligibility requirements in 14 CFR part 61, sections  61.305 and 61.23, but  not  the aeronautical knowledge  requirements specified in section 61.309 , the flight proficiency  requirements specified in section 61.311, and the aeronautical  experience requirements specified in section 61.313;  2.    pass the knowledge test for a Sport Pilot Certificate specified in  14 CFR part 61, section 61.307 or the knowledge test for a  Flight Instructor Certificate with a sport pilot rating specified in  section 61.405;  3.    pass the practical test for a Sport Pilot Certificate specified in  14 CFR part 61, section 61.307;  

4.    provide the FAA with a certified copy of your ultra-light pilot  records from an FAA-recognized ultra-light organization, and  those records must—  

a.    document that you are a registered ultra-light pilot with that  FAA-recognized ultra-light organization; and  b.    indicate that you are recognized to operate each category  and class of aircraft for which you seek sport pilot  privileges.  

# Sport Pilot—Additional Privileges  

If you hold a Sport Pilot Certificate or higher and seek to operate an  additional category or class of light-sport aircraft (14 CFR part 61,  section 61.321), you must:  

1.    receive a logbook endorsement from the authorized instructor  who trained you on the applicable aeronautical knowledge  areas specified in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.309 and areas of  operation specified in section 61.311. The endorsement  certifies you have met the aeronautical knowledge and flight  proficiency requirements for the additional light-sport aircraft  privileges you seek;  2.    successfully complete a proficiency check from an authorized  instructor other than the one who trained you on the  aeronautical knowledge areas     and areas of operation  specified in 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.309 and 61.311 for  the additional light-sport aircraft privilege you seek;  3.    complete an application for  those privileges on a form in a  manner acceptable to the FAA and present this application to  the authorized instructor who conducted the proficiency check  specified in above paragraph;  4.    receive a logbook endorsement from the instructor who  conducted the proficiency check specified in 2 above, certifying  you are proficient in the applicable areas of operation and  aeronautical knowledge areas and that you are authorized for  the additional category and class light-sport aircraft privilege.  

# Aircraft and Equipment Required for the Practical Test/  Proficiency Check  

The applicant for a Sport Pilot Certificate is required in accordance with  14 CFR part 61, section 61.45, to provide an aircraft that has a current  airworthiness certificate and is in a condition for safe flight, for use  during the practical test or proficiency check. This section further  requires that the aircraft must:  

1.    be of U.S., foreign or military registry of the same category,  class, and type, if applicable, for the certificate or privileges for  which the applicant is applying;     2.    have fully functioning dual controls, except as provided for in  14 CFR part 61, section 61.45(c), (e), and (f);  3.    be capable of performing all AREAS OF OPERATION appropriate  to the privileges sought and have no operating limitations, which  prohibit its use in any of the AREAS OF OPERATION, required for  the practical test or proficiency check; and  4.    have an altitude and an airspeed indicating system, as  appropriate, for all tasks that require demonstration of skill within  an altitude/airspeed tolerance.  

The aircraft utilized for sport pilot and sport pilot flight instructor practical  tests and proficiency checks must be a light-sport aircraft as defined in  14 CFR part 1.  

# Flight Instructor Responsibility  

An appropriately rated flight instructor is responsible for training the sport  pilot applicant to acceptable standards in ALL subject matter areas,  procedures, and maneuvers included in the TASKs within each single-seat  aircraft practical test.  

Because of the impact of their teaching activities in developing safe,  proficient pilots, flight instructors should exhibit a high level of knowledge,  skill, and the ability to impart that knowledge and skill to students.  

Throughout the applicant’s training, the flight instructor is responsible for  emphasizing the performance of effective visual scanning and collision  avoidance procedures.  

# Single-Seat Aircraft Practical Test  

Applicants for a Sport Pilot Certificate may elect to take their test in a  single-seat aircraft. The FAA established in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.45(f)  specific requirements to allow a practical test for a Sport Pilot Certificate  only. This provision does not allow a practical test for a Flight Instructor  Certificate or Recreation Pilot Certificate or higher to be conducted in a  light-sport aircraft that has a single-pilot seat.  

With certain limitations, the practical test for a Sport Pilot Certificate may  be conducted from the ground by an examiner. The examiner must agree  to conduct the practical test in a single-seat aircraft and must ensure that  the practical test is conducted in accordance with the sport pilot practical  test standards for single-seat aircraft.  Knowledge of all TASKs  applicable to their category/class of aircraft will be evaluated orally.  Single-seat sport pilots must demonstrate competency in those specific  TASKs identified by a NOTE in the AREA OF OPERATION for a single- seat practical test and any other TASKs selected by the examiner.  Examiners evaluating single-seat applicants from the ground must evaluate  only those TASK  elements  that can be accurately assessed from the  ground.  

The examiner  must maintain radio contact  with the applicant and be in a  position to observe the operation of the aircraft while evaluating the  proficiency of the applicant from the ground.  

Sport pilots taking the practical test in a single-seat aircraft will have the  limitation, “No passenger carriage and flight in a single-pilot seat aircraft  only” placed on their pilot certificate, per section 61.45(f)(3), limiting  their operations to a single-seat light-sport aircraft and no passenger  carriage will be authorized.  

Only an examiner is authorized to remove this limitation when the sport  pilot takes a complete practical test in a two-place light-sport aircraft.  This practical test may be conducted in the same or additional category  of aircraft.  

Upon successful completion of the practical test, the limitation will be  removed, and the sport pilot is authorized to act as pilot in command in  all categories of light-sport aircraft that he or she has a make and model  endorsement within a set of aircraft to operate. The limitation can also  be removed if the sport pilot completes the certification requirements in  an aircraft with a minimum of two places, for a higher certificate or  rating.  

# Single-Seat Aircraft Proficiency Check  

Sport pilot proficiency checks may be performed in a single-seat  aircraft. The FAA believes it is appropriate for an instructor to perform a  proficiency check for an additional category or privilege in accordance  with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.321, to be added to a Sport Pilot  Certificate or higher using a single-seat light-sport aircraft, providing the  authorized instructor is an examiner. When an examiner conducts a  proficiency check they are acting in the capacity of an authorized  instructor.  

The authorized instructor must agree to conduct the practical test in a  single seat light-sport aircraft and must ensure that the proficiency  check is conducted in accordance with the sport pilot practical test  standards for single-seat aircraft. Knowledge of all TASKs applicable to  the category or class of aircraft will be evaluated orally. Those pilots  seeking sport pilot privileges in a single-seat light-sport aircraft must  demonstrate competency in those specific TASKs identified by a NOTE  in the AREA OF OPERATION for a single-seat proficiency check and  any other TASKs selected by the authorized instructor. Authorized  instructors evaluating single-seat applicants from the ground must  evaluate only those TASK  elements  that can be accurately assessed  from the ground.  

# The authorized instructor must have radio contact and be in a  position to observe the operation of the light-sport aircraft and  evaluate the proficiency of the applicant from the ground.  

On successful completion of a proficiency check, the authorized  instructor will issue an endorsement with the following limitation “No  passenger carriage and flight in a single-pilot seat aircraft only (add  category/class/make and model)” limiting his or her operations to a  single-seat aircraft in this category, class, make, and model. The  authorized instructor must sign this endorsement with his or her flight  instructor and examiner number.  

This limitation can be removed by successfully completing a complete  proficiency check, in a two-place light-sport aircraft in that specific  category and class, in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.321.  This proficiency check must be conducted in the same category and  class of light-sport aircraft. Upon successful completion of the  proficiency check, the applicant will be given an endorsement for the  aircraft privilege sought.  

Those recreational pilots or higher exercising sport pilot privileges will  be required to have an endorsement for only the category and/or class  of light-sport aircraft they are now authorized to act as pilot in  command. A sport pilot will be required to have an endorsement for the  category, class, make, and model within a set of aircraft in which he or  she is now authorized to act as pilot in command.  

# Examiner Responsibility  

The examiner conducting the practical test or authorized instructor  conducting the proficiency check is responsible for determining that the  applicant meets the acceptable standards of knowledge and skill of  each TASK within each appropriate AREA OF OPERATION. Since  there is no formal division between the “oral” and “skill” portions of the  practical test or proficiency check, this oral portion becomes an ongoing  process throughout the test. Oral questioning, to determine the  applicant's knowledge of TASKs and related safety factors, should be  used judiciously at all times, especially during the flight portion of the  practical test or proficiency check. Examiners and authorized  instructors must test to the greatest extent practicable the applicant’s  correlative abilities rather than mere rote enumeration of facts  throughout the practical test or proficiency check.  

If the examiner or authorized instructor determines that a TASK is  incomplete, or the outcome uncertain, the examiner may require the  applicant to repeat that TASK, or portions of that TASK. This provision  has been made in the interest of fairness and does not mean that  instruction, practice, or the repeating of an unsatisfactory TASK is  permitted during the certification process. When practical, the remaining  TASKs of the practical test or proficiency check phase should be  completed before repeating the questionable TASK.  

The examiner or authorized instructor must use scenarios when  applicable to determine that the applicant can use good risk  management procedures in making aeronautical decisions.  Examples  of TASKs where scenarios would be advantageous are weather  analysis, performance planning, and runway/landing area selection.  

Throughout the flight portion of the practical test or proficiency check,  the examiner or authorized instructor must evaluate the applicant’s  knowledge and practical incorporation of special emphasis areas.  

# Initial Check—Sport Pilot-Satisfactory Performance  

Satisfactory performance of TASKs to meet the requirements for sport  pilot certification is based on the applicant’s ability to safely:  

1.  perform the TASKs specified in the AREAS OF OPERATION for the certificate or privileges rating sought within the  approved standards;  2.    demonstrate mastery of the aircraft with the successful  outcome of each TASK performed never seriously in doubt;  3.    demonstrate satisfactory proficiency and competency within  the approved standards;  

4. demonstrate sound judgment in aeronautical decision making/  risk management; and  5.    demonstrate single-pilot competence in an aircraft with a single  pilot seat (if applicable).  

# Initial Check—Sport Pilot—Unsatisfactory Performance  

The tolerances represent the performance expected in good flying  conditions. If, in the judgment of the examiner, the applicant does not  meet the standards of performance of any TASK performed, the  associated AREA OF OPERATION is failed and therefore, the practical  test is failed.  

The examiner or applicant may discontinue the test at any time when  the failure of an AREA OF OPERATION makes the applicant ineligible  for the certificate.  The test may be continued ONLY with the consent  of the applicant.  

If the test is discontinued, the applicant is entitled credit for only those  AREAS OF OPERATION and their associated TASKs satisfactorily  performed. However, during the retest, and at the discretion of the  examiner, any TASK may be re-evaluated, including those previously  passed.  

The following are typical areas of unsatisfactory performance and  grounds for disqualification:  

1.    Any action or lack of action by the applicant that requires  corrective intervention by the examiner to maintain safe flight.  2.    Failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques  to clear the area before and while performing maneuvers.  3.    Consistently exceeding tolerances stated in the Objectives.  4.    Failure to take prompt corrective action when tolerances are  exceeded.  

When a Notice of Disapproval is issued, the examiner must record the  applicant’s unsatisfactory performance in terms of the AREA OF  OPERATION and specific TASK(s) not meeting the standard appropriate  to the practical test conducted. The AREA(s) OF OPERATION/TASK(s)  not tested and the number of practical test failures must also be  recorded. If the applicant fails the practical test because of a special  emphasis area, the Notice of Disapproval must indicate the associated  TASK. For example, SECTION 1, VIII. AREA OF OPERATION: SLOW FLIGHT AND STALLS, TASK A: MANEUVERING DURING SLOW  FLIGHT, failure to use proper collision avoidance procedures.  

# Proficiency Check—Sport Pilot—Satisfactory Performance When  Adding an Additional Category/Class  

Satisfactory performance of TASKs to add category/class privileges is  based on the applicant’s ability to safely:  

1.  perform the TASKs specified in the AREAS OF OPERATION for the certificate or privileges sought within the approved  standards;  2.    demonstrate mastery of the aircraft with the successful  outcome of each TASK performed never seriously in doubt;  3.    demonstrate satisfactory proficiency and competency within  the approved standards;  4.    demonstrate sound judgment in aeronautical decision making/  risk management; and  5.    demonstrate single-pilot competence.  

When an applicant is adding a category/class privileges to his or her  Sport Pilot Certificate, the authorized instructor, upon satisfactory  completion of the proficiency check, must endorse the applicant’s  logbook indicating that the applicant is qualified to operate the  additional sport pilot category/class of aircraft. The authorized instructor  must forward FAA Form 8710-11 to Airman Registry within 10 days.  

# Proficiency Check—Sport Pilot—Unsatisfactory Performance  When Adding an Additional Category/Class  

When the applicant’s performance does not meet the standards in the  PTS, the authorized instructor conducting the proficiency check must  annotate the unsatisfactory performance on the FAA Form 8710-11 and  forward it to Airman Registry within 10 days. A Notice of Disapproval  will  NOT  be issued in this instance; rather, the applicant should be  provided with a list of the AREAS OF OPERATION and the specific  TASKs not meeting the standard, so that the applicant may receive  additional training.  

When the applicant receives the additional training in the AREAS OF  OPERATION and the specific TASK(s) found deficient during the  proficiency check, the recommending instructor must endorse the  applicant’s logbook indicating that the applicant has received additional  instruction and has been found competent to pass the proficiency  check. The applicant must complete a new FAA Form 8710-11, and the  recommending instructor must endorse the application. The authorized  instructor, other than the one who provided the additional training, must  evaluate the applicant. When the applicant successfully accomplishes a  complete proficiency check, the authorized instructor, must forward the  FAA Form 8710-11 to Airman Registry within 10 days and endorse the  applicant’s logbook indicating the airman’s additional category/class  privileges.  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management  

Single-Pilot Resource Management refers to the effective use of ALL  available resources: human resources, hardware, and information. It is  similar to Crew Resource Management (CRM) procedures that are  being emphasized in multi-crewmember operations except that only one  crewmember (the pilot) is involved. Human resources “…includes all  other groups routinely working with the pilot who are involved in  decisions that are required to operate a flight safely. These groups  include, but are not limited to: dispatchers, weather briefer,  maintenance personnel, and air traffic controllers.” Singe-pilot Resource  Management is not a single TASK; it is a set of skill competencies that  must be evident in all TASKs in this practical test standard as applied to  single-pilot operation.  

# Applicant’s Use of Checklists  

Throughout the practical test or proficiency check, the applicant is  evaluated on the use of an appropriate checklist (if specified by the  manufacturer). Proper use is dependent on the specific TASK being  evaluated. The situation may be such that the use of the checklist,  while accomplishing elements of an Objective, would be either unsafe  or impractical. In this case, a review of the checklist after the elements  have been accomplished would be appropriate. Division of attention  and proper visual scanning should be considered when using a  checklist.  

# Use of Distractions During Practical Tests or Proficiency  Checks  

Numerous studies indicate that many accidents have occurred when  the pilot has been distracted during critical phases of flight. To evaluate  the applicant’s ability to utilize proper control technique while dividing  attention both inside and/or outside the cockpit, the examiner or  authorized instructor must cause realistic distractions during the flight  portion of the practical test or proficiency check to evaluate the  applicant’s ability to divide attention while maintaining safe flight.  

# Positive Exchange of Flight Controls  

During flight, there must always be a clear understanding between the  pilots of who has control of the aircraft. Prior to flight, a briefing should  be conducted that includes the procedure for the exchange of flight  controls. A positive three-step process in the exchange of flight controls  between pilots is a proven procedure and one that is strongly  recommended.  

When one pilot wishes to give the other pilot control of the aircraft, he  or she will say, “You have the flight controls.” The pilot acknowledges  immediately by saying, “I have the flight controls.” The first pilot says  again, “You have the flight controls.” When control is returned to the  first pilot, follow the same procedure. A visual check is recommended to  verify that the exchange has occurred. There should never be any  doubt as to who is flying the aircraft.  

# Letter of Discontinuance  

When a practical test is discontinued for reasons other than  unsatisfactory performance (i.e., equipment failure, weather, or illness),  FAA Form 8710-11 and, if applicable, the Airman Knowledge Test Report  must be returned to the applicant. The examiner at that time must  prepare, sign, and issue a Letter of Discontinuance to the applicant.  The Letter of Discontinuance should identify the AREAS OF  OPERATION and their associated TASKs of the practical test that were  successfully completed. The applicant must be advised that the Letter  of Discontinuance must be presented to the examiner when the  practical test is resumed, and made part of the certification file.  

# Aeronautical Decision Making and Risk Management  

The examiner or authorized instructor must evaluate the applicant’s  ability throughout the practical test or proficiency check to use good  aeronautical decision making procedures in order to evaluate risks. The  examiner or authorized instructor must accomplish this requirement by  developing scenarios that incorporate as many TASKs as possible to  evaluate the applicants risk management in making safe aeronautical  decisions. For example, the examiner or authorized instructor may  develop a scenario that incorporates weather decisions and  performance planning.

# FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR CERTIFICATE WITH SPORT PILOT PRIVILEGES  

# Flight Instructor Practical Test Section Description  

This section provides guidance and procedures for obtaining a Flight  Instructor Certificate with a sport pilot rating and for adding privileges to  an existing Flight Instructor Certificate at the sport pilot level.  Information provided in the Introduction of this practical test standard  also applies to this section.  

The examiner or authorized instructor determines that the applicant  meets the TASK Objective through the demonstration of competency in  all elements of knowledge and/or skill unless otherwise noted. The  Objectives of TASKs in certain AREAS OF OPERATION, such as  Fundamentals of Instructing and Technical Subjects, include only  knowledge elements. Objectives of TASKs in AREAS OF OPERATION  that include elements of skill, as well as knowledge, also include  common errors, which the applicant shall be able to describe,  recognize, analyze, and correct.  

The word “examiner” is used throughout the standards to denote either  the FAA inspector or an FAA designated pilot examiner who conducts  an official practical test or proficiency check. When an examiner  conducts a proficiency check they are acting in the capacity of an  authorized instructor.  

At the flight instructor level, the Objective of a TASK that involves pilot  skill consists of four parts. The four parts include determination that the  applicant exhibits:  

1.    instructional knowledge of the elements of a TASK. This is  accomplished through descriptions, explanations, and simulated  instruction;  2.    instructional knowledge of common errors related to a TASK,  including their recognition, analysis, and correction;  3.    able to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in the  standards at a more precise level than that indicated in the  sport pilot tolerances; and  4.    the ability to analyze and correct common errors related to a  TASK.  

# Use of the Flight Instructor Section  

The FAA requires that all flight instructor practical tests and proficiency  checks be conducted in accordance with the policies set forth in this  practical test standard. The flight instructor applicant must be prepared  to demonstrate the ability to instruct effectively in  ALL  TASKs included  in the AREAS OF OPERATION appropriate to the category/class  unless otherwise noted.  

A proficiency check is an evaluation of aeronautical knowledge and  flight proficiency IAW 14 CFR part 61.419. A proficiency check shall be  administered using the appropriate PTS for the category of aircraft  when a pilot or a flight instructor adds new category/class privileges.  Upon successful completion of the proficiency check the authorized  instructor will endorse the applicant’s logbook indicating the added  category/class of equipment that the applicant is authorized to operate.  When an examiner conducts a proficiency check they are acting in the  capacity of an authorized instructor.  

All of the procedures and maneuvers to be tested are included in the  sport pilot practical test standards. The flight instructor section contains  the AREAS OF OPERATION that are generic to all flight instructor  evaluations. Flight instructors must also be tested on TASKS located in  the appropriate category/class section the PTS. Those TASKs are listed  in the examiner’s practical test checklist and the instructor’s proficiency  check checklist. The mandatory TASKs are identified by a note located  in each area of operation. In some cases specific TASKs are identified.  In other cases the examiner/instructor selects one or more TASKs in an  area of operation for evaluation. This allows for the practical test for  initial certification and additional privileges to be completed within a  reasonable time frame.  

The term “instructional knowledge” means the instructor applicant is  capable of using the appropriate reference to provide the “application or  correlative level of knowledge” of a subject matter topic, procedure, or  maneuver. It also means that the flight instructor applicant’s discussions,  explanations, and descriptions should follow the recommended teaching  procedures and techniques explained in FAA-H-8083-9, Aviation  Instructor’s Handbook.  

In preparation for the practical test or proficiency check, the examiner or  authorized instructor shall develop a written “plan of action.” The “plan  of action” for an initial certification test shall include the required Tasks  and one or more TASKs in the  Fundamentals of Instruction ,  Technical  Subject Area  and the  Preflight Lesson on a Maneuver to be Performed  in Flight  AREAS OF OPERATION. Additionally, the examiner shall test  the required TASK(s) listed in the examiner’s practical test checklist, for  the appropriate category. The “plan of action” must  always  include the  required TASKs noted in each AREA OF OPERATION.  Any TASK  selected shall be evaluated in its entirety.  

If the applicant is unable to perform a TASK listed in the “plan of action”  due to circumstances beyond his/her control, the examiner or  authorized instructor may substitute another TASK from the applicable  AREA OF OPERATION.  

The “plan of action” used by an authorized instructor for a proficiency  check administered for the addition of an aircraft category and/or class  privilege to a Flight Instructor Certificate shall include TASKs required in  the AREAS OF OPERATION as indicated in the instructor’s proficiency  check checklist located in this section.  

With the exception of the required TASKs, the examiner or authorized  instructor shall not tell the applicant in advance which TASKs will be  included in the “plan of action.” The applicant shall be prepared in  ALL  knowledge and skill areas included in the standards. Throughout the  flight portion of the practical test or proficiency check, the examiner or  authorized  instructor  shall  evaluate  the  applicant’s  ability  to  simultaneously demonstrate and explain procedures and maneuvers,  and to give flight instruction to students at various stages of flight  training and levels of experience.  

The examiner or authorized instructor is expected to use good  judgment in the performance of simulated emergency procedures. The  examiner or authorized instructor shall not simulate any condition that  may jeopardize safe flight or result in possible damage to the aircraft.  The use of the safest means for simulation is expected. Consideration  must be given to local conditions, both meteorological and  topographical, at the time of the test, as well as the applicant’s  workload, and the condition of the aircraft used. If the procedure being  evaluated would jeopardize safety, it is expected that the applicant will  simulate that portion of the maneuver.  

# Special Emphasis Areas  

Examiners or authorized instructors shall place special emphasis upon  areas of aircraft operations considered critical to flight safety. Among  these are:  

1.    positive aircraft control;  2.    procedures for positive exchange of flight controls (who is flying  the aircraft);  3.    stall and spin awareness (if appropriate);  4.    collision avoidance;  5.    wake turbulence and low level windshear avoidance;  6.    runway incursion avoidance;  7.    controlled flight into terrain (CFIT);  8.    aeronautical decision making /risk management;  9.    checklist usage;     10. temporary flight restrictions (TFR);  

11. special use airspace (SUA);     12. aviation security;  13. spatial disorientation; and  14. other areas deemed appropriate to any phase of the practical  test or proficiency check.  

The examiner or authorized instructor shall place special emphasis on  the applicant’s demonstrated ability to teach precise aircraft control and  sound judgment in aeronautical decision making/risk management.  Evaluation of the applicant’s ability to teach judgment shall be  accomplished by asking the applicant to describe the presentation of  practical problems that would be used in instructing students in the  exercise of sound judgment. The examiner or authorized instructor shall  also emphasize the evaluation of the applicant’s demonstrated ability to  teach the special emphasis areas.  

Although these areas may not be specifically addressed under each  TASK, they are essential to flight safety and will be evaluated during the  practical test. In all instances, the applicant’s actions will be evaluated  in accordance to the standards of the tasks and the ability to use good  judgment reference the special emphasis areas listed above.  

# Sport Pilot Flight Instructor Prerequisites—Initial

# Flight Instructor Responsibility  

An appropriately rated flight instructor is responsible for training the  flight instructor applicant to acceptable standards in  ALL  subject matter  areas, procedures, and maneuvers included in the TASKs within each  AREA OF OPERATION in the appropriate category/class in this  practical test standard. In addition, the rated flight instructor is required  to prepare the flight instructor applicant in all tasks in the AREAS OF  OPERATION listed in Section 3.  

Because of the impact of their teaching activities in developing safe,  proficient pilots, flight instructors should exhibit a high level of  knowledge, skill, and the ability to impart that knowledge and skill to  students. The flight instructor must certify that the applicant is:  

1.    able to make a practical application of the fundamentals of  instructing;  2.    competent to teach the subject matter, procedures, and  maneuvers included in the standards to students with varying  backgrounds and levels of experience and ability;  3.    able to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in the  standards at a more precise level than that required at the  sport pilot level; and  4.    competent to pass the required practical test for the issuance  of the Flight Instructor Certificate—Sport Pilot with the associated  category/class privileges or the addition of a category/class  privileges.  

Throughout the flight instructor applicant’s training, the flight instructor  is responsible for emphasizing the performance of, and the ability to  teach, effective visual scanning, runway incursion avoidance, and  collision avoidance procedures. The flight instructor applicant should  develop and use scenario based teaching methods particularly on  special emphasis areas. These areas are covered in AC 90-48, Pilot’s  Role in Collision Avoidance; FAA-H-8083-3, Airplane Flying Handbook;  FAA-H-8083-11, Balloon Flying Handbook; FAA-H-8083-13, Glider  Flying Handbook; FAA-H-8083-21, Rotorcraft Flying Handbook; FAA-H­ 8083-23, Seaplane, Skiplane and Float/Ski Equipped Helicopter  Handbook;  FAA-H-8083-25,  Pilot’s  Handbook  of  Aeronautical  Knowledge; and the  current  Aeronautical Information Manual.  

# Examiner Responsibility  

The examiner conducting the practical test or the authorized instructor  conducting the proficiency check is responsible for determining that the  applicant meets acceptable standards of teaching ability, knowledge,  and skill in the selected TASKs. The examiner or authorized instructor  makes this determination by accomplishing an Objective that is  appropriate to each selected TASK, and includes an evaluation of the  applicant’s:  

1.    ability to apply the fundamentals of instructing;  2.    knowledge of, and ability to teach, the subject matter,  procedures, and maneuvers covered in the TASKs;  3.    able to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in the  standards at a more precise level than that indicated in the  sport pilot tolerances; and  4.    ability to describe, recognize, analyze, and correct common  errors related to the skill procedures and maneuvers covered in  the TASKs.  

# Change 1 (6/9/06)  

It is intended that oral questioning be used at any time during the  ground or flight portion of the practical test or proficiency check to  determine that the applicant can instruct effectively and has a  comprehensive knowledge of the TASKs and their related safety  factors.  

During the flight portion of the practical test the examiner or during  proficiency check the authorized instructor shall act as a student during  selected maneuvers. This will give the examiner or authorized instructor  an opportunity to evaluate the flight instructor applicant’s ability to  analyze and correct simulated common errors related to these  maneuvers. The examiner or authorized instructor will place special  emphasis on the applicant’s use of visual scanning and collision  avoidance procedures, and the applicant’s ability to teach those  procedures.  

Examiners or authorized instructors should to the greatest extent  possible test the applicant’s application and correlation skills. When  possible scenario based questions should be used during the practical  test or proficiency check.  

If the examiner or authorized instructor determines that a TASK is  incomplete, or the outcome uncertain, the examiner or authorized  instructor may require the applicant to repeat that TASK, or portions of  that TASK. This provision has been made in the interest of fairness and  does not mean that instruction, practice or the repeating of an  unsatisfactory task is permitted during the certification process. When  practical, the remaining TASKs of the practical test or proficiency check  phase should be completed before repeating the questionable TASK.  

# Initial  Flight  Instructor  Certification  Check—Satisfactory  Performance  

An applicant who seeks initial flight instructor certification will be  evaluated in all AREAS OF OPERATION of the standards appropriate  to the category/class privileges sought. The examiner shall refer to the  examiner’s practical test checklist, for the appropriate category, located  in this section, to determine the TASKs to be tested, in each AREA OF  OPERATION.  

The practical test is passed if, in the judgment of the examiner, the  applicant demonstrates satisfactory performance with regard to:  

1.    knowledge of the fundamentals of instructing;  2.    knowledge of the technical subject areas;  3.    knowledge of the flight instructor’s responsibilities concerning  the pilot certification process;  

4. knowledge of the flight instructor’s responsibilities concerning  logbook entries and pilot certificate endorsements;  5.    able to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in the  standards at a more precise level than that indicated in the  sport pilot tolerances while giving effective instruction;  6.    competence in teaching the procedures and maneuvers  selected by the examiner;  7.    competence in describing, recognizing, analyzing, and correcting  common errors simulated by the examiner; and  8.    knowledge of the development and effective use of a course of  training, a syllabus, and a lesson plan.  

# Initial Flight Instructor Certification Check—Unsatisfactory  Performance  

If, in the judgment of the examiner, the applicant does not meet the  standards of performance of any TASK performed, the applicable  AREA OF OPERATION is considered unsatisfactory and therefore, the  practical test or proficiency check is failed. The examiner or applicant  may discontinue the test at any time when the failure of an AREA OF  OPERATION makes the applicant ineligible for the certificate or rating  sought .  The test will be continued only with the consent of the  applicant.  

If the test is discontinued, the applicant is entitled credit for only those  AREAS OF OPERATION and their associated TASKs satisfactorily  performed. However, during the retest and at the discretion of the  examiner, any TASK may be re-evaluated, including those previously  considered satisfactory.  

A specific reason for disqualification is:  

1.    failure to perform a procedure or maneuver at a more  precise level than that indicated in the Sport Pilot  tolerances while giving effective flight instruction;  2.    failure to provide an effective instructional explanation  while demonstrating a procedure or maneuver (explanation  during the demonstration must be clear, concise,  technically accurate, and complete with no prompting from  the examiner);  3.    any action or lack of action by the applicant which requires  corrective intervention by the examiner to maintain safe  flight; or  4.    failure to use proper and effective visual scanning  techniques to clear the area before and while performing  maneuvers.  

When a Disapproval Notice is issued, the examiner shall record the  applicant’s unsatisfactory performance in terms of AREA(s) OF  OPERATIONS and specific TASK(s) not meeting the standard  appropriate to the practical test conducted. If the applicant fails the  practical test because of a special emphasis area, the Notice of  Disapproval shall indicate the associated TASK. AN EXAMPLE  WOULD BE: AREA OF OPERATION VI, TRAFFIC PATTERNS, FAILURE TO TEACH PROPER COLLISION AVOIDANCE PROCEDURES.  

# Proficiency Check—Satisfactory Performance When Adding  Additional Category/Class Privileges  

The authorized instructor shall refer to the instructor’s proficiency check  checklist, for the appropriate category, located in this section, to  determine the TASKs to be tested, in each AREA OF OPERATION.  The proficiency check is passed if, in the judgment of the authorized  instructor, the applicant demonstrates satisfactory performance with  regard to:  

1.    knowledge of the fundamentals of instructing;  2.    knowledge of the technical subject areas;  3.    knowledge of the flight instructor’s responsibilities concerning  the pilot certification process;  4.    knowledge of the flight instructor’s responsibilities concerning  logbook entries and pilot certificate endorsements;  5.    be able to perform the procedures and maneuvers included in  the standards at a more precise level than that indicated in the  Sport Pilot tolerances while giving effective instruction;  6.    competence in teaching the procedures and maneuvers  selected by the examiner;  7.    competence in describing, recognizing, analyzing, and correcting  common errors simulated by the examiner; and  8.    knowledge of the development and effective use of a course of  training, a syllabus, and a lesson plan.  

When an applicant is adding a category/class privileges to their Flight  Instructor Certificate, the evaluating authorized instructor shall, upon  successful completion of the proficiency check, endorse the applicant’s  logbook indicating that the applicant is qualified to instruct in an  additional sport pilot category/class of aircraft. The authorized instructor  shall forward FAA Form 8710-11 to Airman Registry within 10 days.  

# Proficiency Check—Unsatisfactory Performance When Adding  Additional Category/Class  Privileges  

When the applicant’s performance does not meet the standards in the  PTS, the authorized instructor conducting the proficiency check shall  annotate the unsatisfactory performance on the FAA Form 8710-11 and  forward it to Airman Registry within 10 days. A Notice of Disapproval  will  NOT  be issued in this instance; rather, the applicant should be  provided with a list of the AREAS OF OPERATION and the specific  TASKs not meeting the standard, so that the applicant may receive  additional training.  

A specific reason for disqualification is:  

1.    failure to perform a procedure or maneuver at a more precise  level than that indicated in the Sport Pilot tolerances while  giving effective flight instruction;  2.    failure to provide an effective instructional explanation while  demonstrating a procedure or maneuver (explanation during  the demonstration must be clear, concise, technically accurate,  and complete with no prompting from the authorized  instructor);  3.    any action or lack of action by the applicant which requires  corrective intervention by the examiner to maintain safe flight;  or  4.    failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques  to clear the area before and while performing maneuvers.  

When the applicant receives the additional training in the AREAS OF  OPERATION and the specific TASK(s) found deficient during the  proficiency check, the recommending instructor shall endorse the  applicant’s logbook indicating that the applicant has received additional  instruction and has been found competent to pass the proficiency  check. The applicant shall complete a new FAA Form 8710-11, and the  recommending instructor shall endorse the application. The authorized  instructor, other than the one who provided the additional training, shall  evaluate the applicant. When the applicant successfully accomplishes a  complete proficiency check, the authorized instructor, shall forward the  FAA Form 8710-11 to Airman Registry within 10 days and indorse the  applicant’s logbook indicating the airman’s additional privileges.  

# Renewal or Reinstatement of a Flight Instructor Certificate  

14 CFR part 61, sections 61.197(a)(1) and 61.199(a) allow an individual  that holds a Flight Instructor Certificate to renew or reinstate that  certificate by passing a practical test. The examiner shall develop a  plan of action that includes at least one TASK, in each AREA OF  OPERATION, in the examiner’s practical test checklist, located in this  section, for the appropriate category. The Renewal or Reinstatement of  one rating on a Flight Instructor Certificate renews or reinstates all  privileges existing on the certificate.
