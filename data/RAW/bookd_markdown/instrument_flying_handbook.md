# Instrument Flying  Handbook  

2012  

# Preface  

This Instrument Flying Handbook is designed for use by instrument flight instructors and pilots preparing for instrument  rating tests. Instructors may find this handbook a valuable training aid as it includes basic reference material for knowledge  testing and instrument flight training. Other Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications should be consulted for  more detailed information on related topics.  

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the FAA. There are different ways of  teaching, as well as performing, flight procedures and maneuvers and many variations in the explanations of aerodynamic  theories and principles. This handbook adopts selected methods and concepts for instrument flying. The discussion and  explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally the word “must” or similar language  is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve  a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

All of the aeronautical knowledge and skills required to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) are detailed.  Chapters are dedicated to human and aerodynamic factors affecting instrument flight, the flight instruments, attitude instrument  flying for airplanes, basic flight maneuvers used in IMC, attitude instrument flying for helicopters, navigation systems, the  National Airspace System (NAS), the air traffic control (ATC) system, instrument flight rules (IFR) flight procedures, and  IFR emergencies. Clearance shorthand and an integrated instrument lesson guide are also included.  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8081-15A, Instrument Flying Handbook, dated 2007.

# Introduction  

# Is an Instrument Rating Necessary?  

The answer to this question depends entirely upon individual  needs. Pilots may not need an instrument rating if they fly in  familiar uncongested areas, stay continually alert to weather  developments, and accept an alternative to their original plan.  However, some cross-country destinations may take a pilot  to unfamiliar airports and/or through high activity areas in  marginal visual or instrument meteorological conditions  (IMC). Under these conditions, an instrument rating may  be an alternative to rerouting, rescheduling, or canceling  a flight. Many accidents are the result of pilots who lack  the necessary skills or equipment to fly in marginal visual  meteorological conditions (VMC) or IMC and attempt flight  without outside references.  

Pilots originally flew aircraft strictly by sight, sound, and  feel while comparing the aircraft’s attitude to the natural  horizon. As aircraft performance increased, pilots required  more inflight information to enhance the safe operation of  their aircraft. This information has ranged from a string tied  to a wing strut, to development of sophisticated electronic  flight information systems (EFIS) and flight management  systems (FMS). Interpretation of the instruments and aircraft  control have advanced from the “one, two, three” or “needle,  ball, and airspeed” system to the use of “attitude instrument  flying” techniques.  

Navigation began by using ground references with dead  reckoning and has led to the development of electronic  navigation systems. These include the automatic direction  finder (ADF), very-high frequency omnidirectional range  (VOR), distance measuring equipment (DME), tactical air  navigation (TACAN), long range navigation (LORAN),  global positioning system (GPS), instrument landing system  (ILS), microwave landing system (MLS), and inertial  navigation system (INS).  

Perhaps you want an instrument rating for the same basic  reason you learned to fly in the first place—because you like  flying. Maintaining and extending your proficiency, once you  have the rating, means less reliance on chance and more on  skill and knowledge. Earn the rating—not because you might  need it sometime, but because it represents achievement and  provides training you will use continually and build upon  as long as you fly. But most importantly it means greater  safety in flying.  

# Instrument Rating Requirements  

A private or commercial pilot must have an instrument  rating and meet the appropriate currency requirements if  that pilot operates an aircraft using an instrument flight  rules (IFR) flight plan in conditions less than the minimums  prescribed for visual flight rules (VFR), or in any flight in  Class A airspace.  

You will need to carefully review the aeronautical knowledge  and experience requirements for the instrument rating as  outlined in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 61. After completing the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) Knowledge Test issued for the  instrument rating, and all the experience requirements have  been satisfied, you are eligible to take the practical test. The  regulations specify minimum total and pilot-in-command  time requirements. This minimum applies to all applicants  regardless of ability or previous aviation experience.  

# Training for the Instrument Rating  

A person who wishes to add the instrument rating to his or  her pilot certificate must first make commitments of time,  money, and quality of training. There are many combinations  of training methods available. Independent studies may be  adequate preparation to pass the required FAA Knowledge  Test for the instrument rating. Occasional periods of ground  and flight instruction may provide the skills necessary to  pass the required test. Or, individuals may choose a training  facility that provides comprehensive aviation education and  the training necessary to ensure the pilot will pass all the  required tests and operate safely in the National Airspace  System (NAS). The aeronautical knowledge may be  administered by educational institutions, aviation-oriented  schools, correspondence courses, and appropriately rated  instructors. Each person must decide for themselves which  training program best meets his or her needs and at the same  time maintain a high quality of training. Interested persons  should make inquiries regarding the available training at  nearby airports, training facilities, in aviation publications,  and through the FAA Flight Standards District Office  (FSDO).  

Although the regulations specify minimum requirements,  the amount of instructional time needed is determined not  by the regulation, but by the individual’s ability to achieve  a satisfactory level of proficiency. A professional pilot with  diversified flying experience may easily attain a satisfactory  level of proficiency in the minimum time required by  regulation. Your own time requirements will depend upon a  variety of factors, including previous flying experience, rate  of learning, basic ability, frequency of flight training, type of  aircraft flown, quality of ground school training, and quality  of flight instruction, to name a few. The total instructional  time you will need, the scheduling of such time, is up to the  individual most qualified to judge your proficiency—the  instructor who supervises your progress and endorses your  record of flight training.  

You can accelerate and enrich much of your training by  informal study. An increasing number of visual aids and  programmed instrument courses is available. The best course  is one that includes a well-integrated flight and ground school  curriculum. The sequential nature of the learning process  requires that each element of knowledge and skill be learned  and applied in the right manner at the right time.  

Part of your instrument training may utilize a flight simulator,  flight training device, basic aviation training device (BATD),  or an advanced aviation training device (AATD). This  ground-based flight training equipment is a valuable tool  for developing your instrument cross-check and learning  procedures, such as intercepting and tracking, holding  patterns, and instrument approaches. Once these concepts are  fully understood, you can then continue with inflight training  and refine these techniques for full transference of your new  knowledge and skills.  

Holding the instrument rating does not necessarily make you a  competent all-weather pilot. The rating certifies only that you  have complied with the minimum experience requirements,  that you can plan and execute a flight under IFR, that you  can execute basic instrument maneuvers, and that you have  shown acceptable skill and judgment in performing these  activities. Your instrument rating permits you to fly into  instrument weather conditions with no previous instrument  weather experience. Your instrument rating is issued on  the assumption that you have the good judgment to avoid  situations beyond your capabilities. The instrument training  program you undertake should help you to develop not only  essential flying skills but also the judgment necessary to use  the skills within your own limits.  

Regardless of the method of training selected, the curriculum  in Appendix B, Instrument Training Lesson Guide, provides  guidance as to the minimum training required for the addition  of an instrument rating to a private or commercial pilot  certificate.  

# Maintaining the Instrument Rating  

Once you hold the instrument rating, you may not act as pilot-  in-command under IFR or in weather conditions less than the  minimums prescribed for VFR, unless you meet the recent  flight experience requirements outlined in 14 CFR part 61.  These procedures must be accomplished within the preceding  6 months and include six instrument approaches, holding  procedures, and intercepting and tracking courses through the  use of navigation systems. If you do not meet the experience  requirements during these 6 months, you have another 6  months to meet these minimums. If the requirements are  still not met, you must pass an instrument proficiency check,  which is an inflight evaluation by a qualified instrument  flight instructor using tasks outlined in the instrument rating  practical test standards (PTS).  

The instrument currency requirements must be accomplished  under actual or simulated instrument conditions. You may log  instrument flight time during the time for which you control  the aircraft solely by reference to the instruments. This can  be accomplished by wearing a view-limiting device, such as  a hood, flying an approved flight-training device, or flying  in actual IMC.  

It takes only one harrowing experience to clarify the  distinction between minimum practical knowledge and a  thorough understanding of how to apply the procedures and  techniques used in instrument flight. Your instrument training  is never complete; it is adequate when you have absorbed  every foreseeable detail of knowledge and skill to ensure a  solution will be available if and when you need it.

# Chapter 1 The National  Airspace System  

# Introduction  

The National Airspace System (NAS) is the network of  United States airspace: air navigation facilities, equipment,  services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical charts,  information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical  information, manpower, and material. Included are system  components shared jointly with the military. The system’s  present configuration is a reflection of the technological  advances concerning the speed and altitude capability of jet  aircraft, as well as the complexity of microchip and satellite- based navigation equipment. To conform to international  aviation standards, the United States adopted the primary  elements of the classification system developed by the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  

This chapter is a general discussion of airspace classification;  en route, terminal, and approach procedures; and operations  within the NAS. Detailed information on the classification  of airspace, operating procedures, and restrictions is found  in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

# Airspace Classification  

Airspace in the United States  [Figure 1-1]  is designated  as follows:  

1. 	 Class A. Generally, airspace from 18,000 feet mean  sea level (MSL) up to and including flight level (FL)  600, including the airspace overlying the waters  within 12 nautical miles (NM) of the coast of the  48 contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise  authorized, all pilots must operate their aircraft under  instrument flight rules (IFR).  

2. 	 Class B. Generally, airspace from the surface to 10,000  feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports in  terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements.  The configuration of each Class B airspace area is  individually tailored, consists of a surface area and two  or more layers (some Class B airspace areas resemble  upside-down wedding cakes), and is designed to  contain all published instrument procedures once  an aircraft enters the airspace. An air traffic control  (ATC) clearance is required for all aircraft to operate  in the area, and all aircraft that are so cleared receive  separation services within the airspace.  

3. 	 Class C. Generally, airspace from the surface to 4,000  feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL)  surrounding those airports that have an operational  control tower are serviced by a radar approach control  and have a certain number of IFR operations or  passenger enplanements. Although the configuration  of each Class C area is individually tailored, the  airspace usually consists of a surface area with a  5 NM radius, an outer circle with a   $10~\mathrm{{NM}}$   radius  that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet above the  airport elevation and an outer area. Each aircraft  must establish two-way radio communications with  the ATC facility providing air traffic services prior  to entering the airspace and thereafter maintain those  communications while within the airspace.  

4. 	 Class D. Generally, airspace from the surface to 2,500  feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL)  surrounding those airports that have an operational  control tower. The configuration of each Class D  airspace area is individually tailored and, when  instrument procedures are published, the airspace  normally designed to contain the procedures. Arrival  extensions for instrument approach procedures (IAPs)  may be Class D or Class E airspace. Unless otherwise  authorized, each aircraft must establish two-way radio  communications with the ATC facility providing  air traffic services prior to entering the airspace and  thereafter maintain those communications while in  the airspace.  

5. 	 Class E. Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, B,  C, or D, and is controlled airspace, then it is Class E  airspace. Class E airspace extends upward from either  the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying  or adjacent controlled airspace. When designated as a  surface area, the airspace is configured to contain all  instrument procedures. Also in this class are federal  airways, airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet  above ground level (AGL) used to transition to and  from the terminal or en route environment, and en  route domestic and offshore airspace areas designated  below 18,000 feet MSL. Unless designated at a lower  altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over  the United States, including that airspace overlying the  waters within  $12\,\mathrm{NM}$   of the coast of the 48 contiguous  states and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet  MSL, and the airspace above FL 600.  

6. 	 Class G. Airspace not designated as Class A, B, C,  D, or E. Class G airspace is essentially uncontrolled  by ATC except when associated with a temporary  control tower.  

# Special Use Airspace  

Special use airspace is the designation for airspace in which  certain activities must be confined or where limitations may  be imposed on aircraft operations that are not part of those  activities. Certain special use airspace areas can create  limitations on the mixed use of airspace. The special use  airspace depicted on instrument charts includes the area name  or number, effective altitude, time and weather conditions  of operation, the controlling agency, and the chart panel  location. On National Aeronautical Navigation Products  (AeroNav Products) en route charts, this information is  available on one of the end panels.  

Prohibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions  within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas  are established for security or other reasons associated with  the national welfare. These areas are published in the Federal  Register and are depicted on aeronautical charts. The area is  charted as a “P” followed by a number (e.g., “P-123”).  

Restricted areas are areas where operations are hazardous to  non participating aircraft and contain airspace within which  the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject  to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be confined  because of their nature, or limitations may be imposed upon  aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or  both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often  invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g., artillery firing, aerial  gunnery, or guided missiles). IFR flights may be authorized  to transit the airspace and are routed accordingly. Penetration  

![](images/36964c7919b9ac8f108a0e229bc4ed479c19d4016441c18f0aa8e014021fabac.jpg)  
Figure 1-1.  Airspace classifications.  

of restricted areas without authorization from the using  or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the  aircraft and its occupants. ATC facilities apply the following  procedures when aircraft are operating on an IFR clearance  (including those cleared by ATC to maintain visual flight  rules (VFR)-On-Top) via a route that lies within joint-use  restricted airspace:  

1. 	 If the restricted area is not active and has been released  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the  ATC facility will allow the aircraft to operate in the  restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance  for it to do so. 2. 	 If the restricted area is active and has not been  released to the FAA, the ATC facility will issue a  clearance that will ensure the aircraft avoids the  restricted airspace.  

Restricted areas are charted with an “R” followed by a  number (e.g., “R-5701”) and are depicted on the en route  chart appropriate for use at the altitude or FL being flown.  

Warning areas are similar in nature to restricted areas;  however, the U.S. Government does not have sole jurisdiction  over the airspace. A warning area is airspace of defined  dimensions, extending from 12 NM outward from the coast of  the United States, containing activity that may be hazardous  to non participating aircraft. The purpose of such areas is  to warn non participating pilots of the potential danger. A  warning area may be located over domestic or international  waters or both. The airspace is designated with a “W”  followed by a number (e.g., “W-123”).  

Military operations areas (MOAs) consist of airspace with  defined vertical and lateral limits established for the purpose  of separating certain military training activities from IFR  traffic. Whenever an MOA is being used, non participating  IFR traffic may be cleared through an MOA if IFR separation  can be provided by ATC. Otherwise, ATC will reroute or  restrict non participating IFR traffic. MOAs are depicted on  sectional, VFR terminal area, and en route low altitude charts  and are not numbered (e.g., “Boardman MOA”).  

Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with an  “A” followed by a number (e.g., “A-123”) to inform  non participating pilots of areas that may contain a high  volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity.  Pilots should exercise caution in alert areas. All activity  within an alert area shall be conducted in accordance with  regulations, without waiver, and pilots of participating  aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area, shall be equally  responsible for collision avoidance.  

Military Training Routes (MTRs) are routes used by military  aircraft to maintain proficiency in tactical flying. These routes  are usually established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations  at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Some route segments may  be defined at higher altitudes for purposes of route continuity.  Routes are identified as IFR (IR) and VFR (VR) followed by  a number. MTRs with no segment above 1,500 feet AGL are  identified by four number characters (e.g., IR1206, VR1207).  MTRs that include one or more segments above 1,500 feet  AGL are identified by three number characters (e.g., IR206,  VR207). IFR low altitude en route charts depict all IR routes  and all VR routes that accommodate operations above 1,500  feet AGL. IR routes are conducted in accordance with IFR  regardless of weather conditions.  

Temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) are put into effect  when traffic in the airspace would endanger or hamper air  or ground activities in the designated area. For example, a  forest fire, chemical accident, flood, or disaster-relief effort  could warrant a TFR, which would be issued as a Notice to  Airmen (NOTAM).  

National Security Areas (NSAs) consist of airspace with  defined vertical and lateral dimensions established at  locations where there is a requirement for increased security  and safety of ground facilities. Flight in NSAs may be  temporarily prohibited by regulation under the provisions of  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 99  and prohibitions will be disseminated via NOTAM.  

# Federal Airways  

The primary means for routing aircraft operating under  IFR is the Federal Airways System. Each Federal airway is  based on a centerline that extends from one navigational aid  (NAVAID)/waypoint/fix/intersection to another NAVAID/ waypoint/fix/intersection specified for that airway. A Federal  airway includes the airspace within parallel boundary lines   $4~\mathrm{{NM}}$   to each side of the centerline. As in all instrument  flight, courses are magnetic, and distances are in NM. The  airspace of a Federal airway has a floor of 1,200 feet AGL,  unless otherwise specified. A Federal airway does not include  the airspace of a prohibited area.  

Victor airways include the airspace extending from 1,200  feet AGL up to, but not including 18,000 feet MSL. The  airways are designated on sectional and IFR low altitude en  route charts with the letter “V” followed by a number (e.g.,  “V23”). Typically, Victor airways are given odd numbers  when oriented north/south and even numbers when oriented  east/west. If more than one airway coincides on a route  segment, the numbers are listed serially (e.g., “V287-495- 500”). [Figure 1-2]  

![](images/3c4bf036e28ffe4c07fbf7b9965c45d5276d9a1d9ec8585ebde6af7b9dd18fc5.jpg)  
Figure 1-2.  Victor airways and charted IFR altitudes.  

Jet routes exist only in Class A airspace, from 18,000 feet MSL  to FL 450, and are depicted on high-altitude en route charts.  The letter “J” precedes a number to label the airway (e.g., J12).  

Area navigation (RNAV) routes have been established in  both the low-altitude and the high-altitude structures in recent  years and are depicted on the en route low and high chart  series. High altitude RNAV routes are identified with a “Q”  prefix (except the Q-routes in the Gulf of Mexico) and low  altitude RNAV routes are identified with a “T” prefix. RNAV  routes and data are depicted in aeronautical blue.  

In addition to the published routes, a random RNAV route  may be flown under IFR if it is approved by ATC. Random  RNAV routes are direct routes, based on RNAV capability,  between waypoints defined in terms of latitude/longitude  coordinates, degree-distance fixes, or offsets from established  routes/airways at a specified distance and direction.  

Radar monitoring by ATC is required on all random  RNAV routes. These routes can only be approved in a  radar environment. Factors that are considered by ATC  in approving random RNAV routes include the capability  to provide radar monitoring and compatibility with traffic  volume and flow. ATC will radar monitor each flight;  however, navigation on the random RNAV route is the  responsibility of the pilot.  

# Other Routing  

Preferred IFR routes have been established between  major terminals to guide pilots in planning their routes of  flight, minimizing route changes, and aiding in the orderly  management of air traffic on Federal airways. Low and high  altitude preferred routes are listed in the Airport/Facility  Directory (A/FD). To use a preferred route, reference the  departure and arrival airports; if a routing exists for your  flight, then airway instructions are listed.  

Tower En Route Control (TEC) is an ATC program that  uses overlapping approach control radar services to provide  IFR clearances. By using TEC, a pilot is routed by airport  control towers. Some advantages include abbreviated filing  procedures and reduced traffic separation requirements. TEC  is dependent upon the ATC’s workload, and the procedure  varies among locales.  

The latest version of Advisory Circular (AC) 90-91, North  American Route Program (NRP), provides guidance to users  of the NAS for participation in the NRP. All flights operating  at or above FL 290 within the conterminous United States  and Canada are eligible to participate in the NRP, the primary  purpose of which is to allow operators to plan minimum time/ cost routes that may be off the prescribed route structure. NRP  aircraft are not subject to route-limiting restrictions (e.g.,  published preferred IFR routes) beyond a  $200\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   radius of  their point of departure or destination.  

# IFR En Route Charts  

The objective of IFR en route flight is to navigate within the  lateral limits of a designated airway at an altitude consistent  with the ATC clearance. Your ability to fly instruments  safely and competently in the system is greatly enhanced by  understanding the vast array of data available to the pilot on  instrument charts. AeroNav Products maintains and produces  the charts for the U.S. Government.  

En route high-altitude charts provide aeronautical information  for en route instrument navigation at or above 18,000 feet  MSL. Information includes the portrayal of Jet and RNAV  routes, identification and frequencies of radio aids, selected  airports, distances, time zones, special use airspace, and  related information. Established jet routes from 18,000 feet  MSL to FL 450 use NAVAIDs not more than  $260\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   apart.  The charts are revised every 56 days.  

To effectively depart from one airport and navigate en route  under instrument conditions, a pilot needs the appropriate  IFR en route low-altitude chart(s). The IFR low altitude en  route chart is the instrument equivalent of the sectional chart.  When folded, the cover of the AeroNav Products en route  chart displays an index map of the United States showing the  coverage areas. Cities near congested airspace are shown in  black type and their associated area chart is listed in the box  in the lower left-hand corner of the map coverage box. Also  noted is an explanation of the off-route obstruction clearance  altitude (OROCA). The effective date of the chart is printed  on the other side of the folded chart. Information concerning  MTRs is also included on the chart cover. The en route charts  are revised every 56 days.  

When the AeroNav Products en route chart is unfolded, the  legend is displayed and provides information concerning  airports, NAVAIDs, communications, air traffic services,  and airspace.  

# Airport Information  

Airport information is provided in the legend, and the  symbols used for the airport name, elevation, and runway  length are similar to the sectional chart presentation.  Associated city names are shown for public airports only.  FAA identifiers are shown for all airports. ICAO identifiers  are also shown for airports outside of the contiguous United  States. Instrument approaches can be found at airports with  blue or green symbols, while the brown airport symbol  denotes airports that do not have instrument approaches.  Stars are used to indicate the part-time nature of tower  operations, Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS)  frequencies, part-time or on request lighting facilities, and  part-time airspace classifications. A box after an airport name  with a “C” or “D” inside (e.g.,   ) indicates Class C and D  airspace, respectively, per  Figure 1-3 .  

# Charted IFR Altitudes  

The minimum en route altitude (MEA) ensures a navigation  signal strong enough for adequate reception by the aircraft  navigation (NAV) receiver and obstacle clearance along the  airway. Communication is not necessarily guaranteed with  MEA compliance. The obstacle clearance, within the limits of  the airway, is typically 1,000 feet in non-mountainous areas  and 2,000 feet in designated mountainous areas. MEAs can  be authorized with breaks in the signal coverage; if this is  the case, the AeroNav Products en route chart notes “MEA  GAP” parallel to the affected airway. MEAs are usually  bidirectional; however, they can be single-directional. Arrows  are used to indicate the direction to which the MEA applies.  

The minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), as the  name suggests, provides the same obstruction clearance as  an MEA; however, the NAV signal reception is ensured only  within  $22\,\mathrm{NM}$   of the closest NAVAID defining the route. The  MOCA is listed below the MEA and indicated on AeroNav  Products charts by a leading asterisk (e.g.,   $^{\ll;*}3400^{\backprime}$  —see  Figure 1-2 , V287 at bottom left).  

The minimum reception altitude (MRA) identifies the lowest  altitude at which an intersection can be determined from  an off-course NAVAID. If the reception is line-of-sight  based, signal coverage only extends to the MRA or above.  However, if the aircraft is equipped with distance measuring  equipment (DME) and the chart indicates the intersection can  be identified with such equipment, the pilot could define the  

![](images/92e9d07f5af1e53c37cd1d9c2018592d4f7231d8e2949d98b595d55ec939ee42.jpg)  
Figure 1-3.  En route airport legend.  

fix without attaining the MRA. On AeroNav Products charts,  the MRA is indicated by the symbol   $\twoheadrightarrow$  and the altitude  preceded by “MRA” (e.g., “MRA 9300”).  [Figure 1-2]  

The minimum crossing altitude (MCA) is charted when  a higher MEA route segment is approached. The MCA is  usually indicated when a pilot is approaching steeply rising  terrain and obstacle clearance and/or signal reception is  compromised. In this case, the pilot is required to initiate a  climb so the MCA is reached by the time the intersection is  crossed. On AeroNav Products charts, the MCA is indicated  by the symbol   $\twoheadrightarrow$  , and the Victor airway number, altitude,  and the direction to which it applies (e.g. “V24 8000 SE”).  

The maximum authorized altitude (MAA) is the highest  altitude at which the airway can be flown with assurance  of receiving adequate navigation signals. Chart depictions  appear as “MAA-15000.”  

When an MEA, MOCA, and/or MAA change on a segment  other than at a NAVAID, a sideways “T” ( ) is depicted  on the chart. If there is an airway break without the symbol,  one can assume the altitudes have not changed (see the upper  left area of  Figure 1-2 ). When a change of MEA to a higher  MEA is required, the climb may commence at the break,  ensuring obstacle clearance.  [Figure 1-4]  

# Navigation Features Types of NAVAIDs  

Very high frequency omnidirectional ranges (VORs) are the  principal NAVAIDs that support the Victor and Jet airways.  Many other navigation tools are also available to the pilot.  For example, nondirectional beacons (NDBs) can broadcast  signals accurate enough to provide stand-alone approaches,  and DME allows the pilot to pinpoint a reporting point on the  airway. Though primarily navigation tools, these NAVAIDs  can also transmit voice broadcasts.  

Tactical air navigation (TACAN) channels are represented  as the two- or three-digit numbers following the three-letter  identifier in the NAVAID boxes. The AeroNav Products  terminal procedures provide a frequency-pairing table for  the TACAN-only sites. On AeroNav Products charts, very- high frequencies and ultra-high frequencies (VHF/UHF)  NAVAIDs (e.g., VORs) are depicted in black, while low  frequencies and medium frequencies (LF/MF) are depicted  as brown.  [Figure 1-5]  

# Identifying Intersections  

Intersections along the airway route are established by a variety  of NAVAIDs. An open triangle  $\triangle$   indicates the location of an  ATC reporting point at an intersection. If the triangle is solid   $\blacktriangle$  , a report is compulsory.  [Figure 1-4]  NDBs, localizers,

and off-route VORs are used to establish intersections. NDBs  are sometimes collocated with intersections, in which case  passage of the NDB would mark the intersection. A bearing to  an off-route NDB also can provide intersection identification.  A localizer course used to identify an intersection is depicted  by a feathered arrowhead symbol on the en route chart  ( ). If feathered markings appear on  

the left-hand side of the arrowhead ( ),  a back course (BC) signal is transmitted. On AeroNav Products  en route charts, the localizer symbol is only depicted to identify  an intersection.  

Off-route VORs remain the most common means of  identifying intersections when traveling on an airway. Arrows  depicted next to the intersection  $\fallingdotseq$   indicate the NAVAID  to be used for identification. Another means of identifying an  intersection is with the use of DME. A hollow arrowhead  $\nleftarrow$    indicates DME is authorized for intersection identification. If  the DME mileage at the intersection is a cumulative distance  of route segments, the mileage is totaled and indicated by  a D-shaped symbol with a mileage number inside   $\xleftarrow{\overline{{00}}}$  .  [Figure 1-4]  Approved IFR global positioning system (GPS)  units can also be used to report intersections.  

# Other Route Information  

DME and GPS provide valuable route information concerning  such factors as mileage, position, and ground speed. Even  without this equipment, information is provided on the charts  for making the necessary calculations using time and distance.  The en route chart depicts point-to-point distances on the  airway system. Distances from VOR to VOR are charted with  a number inside of a box  $\overline{{000}}$  . To differentiate distances when  two airways coincide, the word “TO” with the three-letter VOR  identifier appear to the left of the distance boxes  .  

VOR changeover points (COPs) are depicted on the charts by  this symbol  . The numbers indicate the distance at which  to change the VOR frequency. The frequency change might  be required due to signal reception or conflicting frequencies.  If a COP does not appear on an airway, the frequency should  be changed midway between the facilities. A COP at an  intersection may indicate a course change.  

Occasionally an “x” appears at a separated segment of an  airway that is not an intersection. The “x” is a mileage  breakdown or computer navigation fix and may indicate a  course change.  

Today’s computerized system of ATC has greatly reduced  

patterns are still found on charts at junctures  where ATC has deemed it necessary to enable  traffic flow. When a holding pattern is charted,  

![](images/f9dd3c928e86d6cc57adc44418bce67664a95035824218113f347723354d7f18.jpg)  

the controller may provide the holding direction and the  statement “as published.”  [Figure 1-4]  

Boundaries separating the jurisdiction of Air Route Traffic  Control Centers (ARTCC) are depicted on charts with blue  serrations  . The name of the controlling  

facility is printed on the corresponding side  of the division line. ARTCC remote sites are  depicted as blue serrated boxes and contain  

![](images/6a8b42bb400e4d664575aa828ae6b2e8af4dffed30e552de3a1e512133dfdaee.jpg)  

the center name, sector name, and the sector frequency.  [Figure 1-4]  

Weather Information and Communication Features En route NAVAIDs also provide weather information and  serve communication functions. When a NAVAID is shown  

![](images/96b86dfcf28f0b5628ce098396262ab96664b018f2947974c907f8aa6fe8fb7c.jpg)  

as a shadowed box, an automated  flight service station (AFSS) of the  same name is directly associated with  the facility. If an AFSS is located  without an associated NAVAID, the  

shadowed box is smaller and contains only the name and  identifier. The AFSS frequencies are provided above the  

box. (Frequencies 122.2 and 255.4,  and emergency frequencies 121.5 and  243.0 are not listed.)  

![](images/2cc8d997b29ea8a6d57facd8b4fc964ea1147e9f587441a0e1f4c508c880d0fc.jpg)  

A Remote Communications Outlet (RCO) associated with  a NAVAID is designated by a thin-lined box with the  

controlling AFSS frequency above  the box and the name under the box.  Without an associated facility, the  thin-lined RCO box contains the  AFSS name and remote frequency.  

![](images/77fe001f774157171eb31b732ec5cf0ffc2071e3e3e97b3b1c28594914037f38.jpg)  

Automated Surface Observing  

Station (ASOS), Automated Weather Observing Station 

 (AWOS), Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service 

 (HIWAS), and Transcribed Weather Broadcast (TWEB)  

are continuously transmitted over  selected NAVAIDs and depicted  in the NAVAID box. ASOS/ AWOS are depicted by a white

# New Technologies  

Technological advances have made multifunction displays  and moving maps more common in newer aircraft. Even older  aircraft are being retrofitted to include “glass” in the flight  deck.  [Figure 1-6]  Moving maps improve pilot situational  awareness (SA) by providing a picture of aircraft location  in relation to NAVAIDS, waypoints, airspace, terrain, and  

![](images/42f42b3158fa581ad8c5827c74bbda52747fc6cd0c364213dc5328effc5ded5b.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.  Moving map display.  

hazardous weather. GPS systems can be certified for terminal  area and en route use as well as approach guidance.  

Additional breakthroughs in display technology are the  new electronic chart systems or electronic flight bags that  facilitate the use of electronic documents in the general  aviation flight deck.  [Figure 1-7]  An electronic chart or  flight bag is a self-powered electronic library that stores and  displays en route charts and other essential documents on a  screen. These electronic devices can store the digitized United  States terminal procedures, en route charts, the complete  A/FD, in addition to 14 CFR and the AIM. Full touch-screen  based computers allow pilots to view airport approach and  area charts electronically while flying. With FAA approval,  an operator may replace paper charts as well as other paper  materials including minimum equipment lists (MELs),  standard operating procedures (SOPs), standard instrument  departures (SIDs), standard terminal arrival routes (STARs),  checklists, and flight deck manuals. As with paper flight  publications, the electronic database needs to be current  to provide accurate information regarding NAVAIDS,  waypoints, and terminal procedures. Databases are updated  every 28 days and are available from various commercial  vendors. Pilots should be familiar with equipment operation,  capabilities, and limitations prior to use.

# Terminal Procedures Publications  

While the en route charts provide the information necessary  to safely transit broad regions of airspace, the United States  Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) enables pilots to  guide their aircraft in the airport area. Whether departing or  arriving, these procedures exist to make the controllers’ and  pilots’ jobs safer and more efficient. Available in booklets by  region (published by AeroNav Products), the TPP includes  approach procedures, STARs, Departure Procedures (DPs),  and airport diagrams.  

# Departure Procedures  

There are two types of DPs: Obstacle Departure Procedures  (ODP) and SIDs.  [Figure 1-8]  Both types of DPs provide  obstacle clearance protection to aircraft in instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC), while reducing  communications and departure delays. DPs are published in  text and/or charted graphic form. Regardless of the format, all  DPs provide a way to depart the airport and transition to the  en route structure safely. When possible, pilots are strongly  encouraged to file and fly a DP at night, during marginal  visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and IMC.  

All DPs provide obstacle clearance provided the aircraft  crosses the end of the runway at least 35 feet AGL; climbs  to 400 feet above airport elevation before turning; and climbs  at least 200 feet per nautical mile (FPNM), unless a higher  climb gradient is specified to the assigned altitude. ATC may  vector an aircraft off a previously assigned DP; however,  the 200 FPNM or the FPNM specified in the DP is required.  

Textual ODPs are listed by city and airport in the IFR Take- Off Minimums and DPs section of the TPP. SIDs are depicted  in the TPP following the approach procedures for the airport.  

# Standard Terminal Arrival Routes  

STARs depict prescribed routes to transition the instrument  pilot from the en route structure to a fix in the terminal area  from which an instrument approach can be conducted. If a  pilot does not have the appropriate STAR, write “No STAR”  in the flight plan. However, if the controller is busy, the pilot  might be cleared along the same route and, if necessary, the  controller has the pilot copy the entire text of the procedure.  

STARs are listed alphabetically at the beginning of the  AeroNav Products booklet.  Figure 1-9  shows an example  of a STAR, and the legend for STARs and DPs printed in  AeroNav Products booklets.  

# Instrument Approach Procedure Charts  

The instrument approach procedure (IAP) chart provides  the method to descend and land safely in low visibility  conditions. The FAA establishes an IAP after thorough  analyses of obstructions, terrain features, and navigational  facilities. Maneuvers, including altitude changes, course  corrections, and other limitations, are prescribed in the IAP.  The approach charts reflect the criteria associated with the  United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach  Procedures (TERPs), which prescribes standardized methods  for use in designing instrument flight procedures.  

In addition to the AeroNav Products, other governmental  and corporate entities produce approach procedures. The  U.S. Military IAPs are established and published by the  Department of Defense and are available to the public  upon request. Special IAPs are approved by the FAA for  individual operators and are not available to the general  public. Foreign country standard IAPs are established and  published according to the individual country’s publication  procedures. The information presented in the following  sections highlight features of the United States TPP.  

The instrument approach chart is divided into six main  sections, which include the margin identification, pilot  briefing (and notes), plan view, profile view, landing  minimums, and airport diagram.  [Figure 1-10]  An  examination of each section follows.  

# Margin Identification  

The margin identification, at the top and bottom of the chart,  depicts the airport location and procedure identification.  The civil approach plates are organized by city, then airport  name and state. For example, Orlando Executive in Orlando,  Florida, is alphabetically listed under “O” for Orlando.  Military approaches are organized by airport name first.  

The chart’s amendment status appears below the city  and state in the bottom margin. The amendment number  is followed by the five-digit julian-date of the last chart  change.“  $"05300"$   is read, “the 300th day of 2005.” At the  center of the top margin is the FAA chart reference number  and the approving authority. At the bottom center, the  airport’s latitude and longitude coordinates are provided. If  a chart is original, the date of issuance can be used instead  of the julian-date.  

The procedure chart title (top and bottom margin area of  Figure 1-10 ) is derived from the type of navigational facility  providing final approach course guidance. A runway number  is listed when the approach course is aligned within   $30^{\circ}$  of the runway centerline. This type of approach allows a  straight-in landing under the right conditions. The type of  approach followed by a letter identifies approaches that do  not have straight-in landing minimums. Examples include  procedure titles at the same airport, which have only  circling minimums. The first approach of this type created

#  16 DEC 2010 to 13 JAN 2011  

![](images/dd2b3c815e642e5af8a9fad5eb72604c363db4ad7668e3a45ccfb1c25d31ef75.jpg)  

![](images/3604fc2ca69c274254e2b0fd97ce42af6a8e7eb38ae690a35855e7564ab96ae0.jpg)  

at the airport is labeled with the letter A, and the lettering  continues in alphabetical order (e.g., “VOR-A or “LDA-B”).  The letter designation signifies the expectation is for the  procedure to culminate in a circling approach to land. As a  general rule, circling-only approaches are designed for one  of the two following reasons:  

• 	 The final approach course alignment with the runway  centerline exceeds   $30^{\circ}$  . • 	 The descent gradient is greater than 400 FPNM from  the final approach fix (FAF) to the threshold crossing  height (TCH). When this maximum gradient is  exceeded, the circling-only approach procedure may  be designed to meet the gradient criteria limits.  

Further information on this topic can be found in the  Instrument Procedures Handbook, Chapter 4, under  Approach Naming Chart Conventions.  

To distinguish between the left, right, and center runways,  an “L,” “R,” or “C” follows the runway number (e.g., “ILS  RWY 16R”). In some cases, an airport might have more than  one circling approach, shown as VOR-A, VOR/DME-B, etc.  

More than one navigational system separated by a slash  indicates more than one type of equipment is required to  execute the final approach (e.g., VOR/DME RWY 31).  More than one navigational system separated by “or”  indicates either type of equipment may be used to execute  the final approach (e.g., VOR or GPS RWY 15). Multiple  approaches of the same type, to the same runway and using  the same guidance, have an additional letter from the end of  the alphabet, number, or term in the title (e.g., ILS Z RWY  28, SILVER ILS RWY 28, or ILS 2 RWY 28). VOR/DME  RNAV approaches are identified as VOR/DME RNAV  RWY (runway number). Helicopters have special IAPs  designated with COPTER in the procedure identification  (e.g., COPTER LOC/DME 25L). Other types of navigation  systems may be required to execute other portions of the  approach prior to intercepting the final approach segment  or during the missed approach.  

# The Pilot Briefing  

The pilot briefing is located at the top of the chart and  provides the pilot with information required to complete  the published approach procedure. Included in the pilot  briefing are the NAVAID providing approach guidance,  its frequency, the final approach course, and runway  information. A notes section contains additional procedural  information. For example, a procedural note might indicate  restrictions for circling maneuvers. Some other notes might  concern a local altimeter setting and the resulting change  in the minimums. The use of RADAR may also be noted in  this section. Additional notes may be found in the plan view.  

When a triangle containing a “T”   $(\pmb{\bigtriangledown})$  ) appears in the notes  section, it signifies the airport has nonstandard IFR takeoff  minimums. Pilots should refer to the DPs section of the TPP  to determine takeoff minimums.  

When a triangle containing an “A” (  $\pmb{\triangle})$   appears in the notes  section, it signifies the airport has nonstandard IFR alternate  minimums. Civil pilots should refer to the Alternate Minimums  Section of the TPP to determine alternate minimums. Military  pilots should refer to appropriate regulations.  

When a triangle containing an “A” NA ( ) appears in  the notes area, it signifies that Alternate Minimums are Not  Authorized due to unmonitored facility or the absence of  weather reporting service.  

Communication frequencies are listed in the order in which  they would be used during the approach. Frequencies for  weather and related facilities are included, where applicable,  such as ATIS, ASOS, AWOS, and AFSSs.  

# The Plan View  

The plan view provides a graphical overhead view of the  procedure and depicts the routes that guide the pilot from  the en route segments to the initial approach fix (IAF).  [Figure 1-10]  During the initial approach, the aircraft has  departed the en route phase of flight and is maneuvering to enter  an intermediate or final segment of the instrument approach.  An initial approach can be made along prescribed routes within  the terminal area, which may be along an arc, radial, course,  heading, radar vector, or a combination thereof. Procedure turns  and high-altitude teardrop penetrations are initial approach  segments. Features of the plan view, including the procedure  turn, obstacle elevation, minimum safe altitude (MSA), and  procedure track are depicted in  Figure 1-11 . Terrain is depicted  in the plan view portion of all IAPs if the terrain within the  plan view exceeds 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, or if  within a 6 NM radius of the airport reference point the terrain  rises at least 2,000 feet above the airport elevation.  

Some AeroNav Products charts contain a reference or  distance circle with a specified radius (  $.10~\mathrm{{NM}}$   is most  common). Normally, approach features within the plan  view are shown to scale; however, only the data within the  reference circle is always drawn to scale.  

Concentric dashed circles, or concentric rings around the  distance circle, are used when the information necessary to  the procedure will not fit to scale within the limits of the plan  view area. They serve as a means to systematically arrange  this information in its relative position outside and beyond  the reference circle. These concentric rings are labeled en  route facilities and feeder facilities.

The primary airport depicted in the plan view is drawn  with enough detail to show the runway orientation and final  approach course alignment. Airports other than the primary  approach airport are not normally depicted in the AeroNav  Products plan view.  

Known spot elevations are indicated on the plan view with a  dot in MSL altitude. The largest dot and number combination  indicates the highest elevation. An inverted “V” with a dot in  the center depicts an obstacle   $({\pmb\Delta})$  ). The highest obstacle is  indicated with a bolder, larger version of the same symbol.  [Figure 1-11]  

The MSA circle appears in the plan view, except in approaches  for which the Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) format is used or  appropriate NAVAIDs (e.g., VOR or NDB) are unavailable.  The MSA is provided for emergency purposes only and  guarantees 1,000 feet obstruction clearance in the sector  indicated with reference to the bearings in the circle. For  conventional navigation systems, the MSA is normally based  on the primary omnidirectional facility (NAVAID) on which  

![](images/9578e121ac6dfcc2240b3e92818cb2aed39065db7d2357f3d0e35a16b6d5d827.jpg)  

the IAP is predicated. The MSA depiction  on the approach chart contains the facility  identifier of the NAVAID used to determine  the MSA altitudes. For RNAV approaches,  the MSA is based on the runway waypoint for  straight-in approaches or the airport waypoint  

for circling approaches. For GPS approaches, the MSA center  header is the missed approach waypoint. The MSL altitudes  appear in boxes within the circle, which is typically a  $25\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  radius unless otherwise indicated. The MSA circle header  refers to the letter identifier of the NAVAID or waypoint that  describes the center of the circle.  

NAVAIDs necessary for the completion of the instrument  procedure include the facility name, letter identifier, and  Morse code sequence. They may also furnish the frequency,  Morse code, and channel. A heavy-lined NAVAID box  depicts the primary NAVAID used for the approach. An 

 “I” in front of the NAVAID identifier (in  Figure 1-11 , 

 “I-AVL”) listed in the NAVAID box indicates a localizer.  The requirement for an ADF, DME, or RADAR in the  approach is noted in the plan view.  

and approach sequencing information. The main procedure  or final approach course is a thick, solid line ( ).  A DME arc, which is part of the main procedure course,  is also represented as a thick, solid line ( ). A  feeder route is depicted with a medium line ( ) and  provides heading, altitude, and distance information. (All  three components must be designated on the chart to provide  a navigable course.) Radials, such as lead radials, are shown  by thin lines ( ). The missed approach track is drawn  using a thin, hash marked line with a directional arrow  ( ). A visual flightpath segment  appears as a thick dashed line with a directional arrow  ( Visual Flightpath  ). IAFs are charted IAF when associated  with a NAVAID or when freestanding.  

The missed approach holding pattern track is represented with  a thin, dashed line. When collocated, the missed approach  holding pattern and procedure turn holding pattern are  indicated as a solid, black line. Arrival holding patterns are  depicted as thin, solid lines.  

# Terminal Arrival Area (TAA)  

The design objective of the TAA procedure is to provide  a transition method for arriving aircraft with GPS/RNAV  equipment. TAAs also eliminate or reduce the need for  feeder routes, departure extensions, and procedure turns or  course reversal. The TAA is controlled airspace established  in conjunction with the standard or modified RNAV  approach configurations.  

The standard TAA has three areas: straight-in, left base, and  right base. The arc boundaries of the three areas of the TAA  are published portions of the approach and allow aircraft to  transition from the en route structure direct to the nearest  IAF. When crossing the boundary of each of these areas or  when released by ATC within the area, the pilot is expected  to proceed direct to the appropriate waypoint IAF for the  approach area being flown. A pilot has the option in all areas  of proceeding directly to the holding pattern.  

The TAA has a “T” structure that normally provides a No  Procedure Turn (NoPT) for aircraft using the approach.  [Figure 1-12]  The TAA provides the pilot and air traffic  controller with an efficient method for routing traffic from  the en route to the terminal structure. The basic “T” contained  in the TAA normally aligns the procedure on runway  centerline with the missed approach point (MAP) located  at the threshold, the FAF 5 NM from the threshold, and the  intermediate fix (IF) 5 NM from the FAF.  

In order to accommodate descent from a high en route altitude  to the initial segment altitude, a hold in lieu of a procedure  turn provides the aircraft with an extended distance for the  necessary descent gradient. The holding pattern constructed for  this purpose is always established on the center IAF waypoint.  Other modifications may be required for parallel runways or  special operational requirements. When published, the RNAV  chart depicts the TAA through the use of icons representing  each TAA associated with the RNAV procedure. These  icons are depicted in the plan view of the approach, generally  arranged on the chart in accordance with their position relative  to the aircraft’s arrival from the en route structure.

# Course Reversal Elements in Plan View and  Profile View  

Course reversals included in an IAP are depicted in one of  three different ways: a   $45^{\circ}/180^{\circ}$   procedure turn, a holding  pattern in lieu of procedure turn, or a teardrop procedure.  The maneuvers are required when it is necessary to reverse  direction to establish the aircraft inbound on an intermediate  or final approach course. Components of the required  procedure are depicted in the plan view and the profile view.  The maneuver must be completed within the distance and  at the minimum altitude specified in the profile view. Pilots  should coordinate with the appropriate ATC facility relating  to course reversal during the IAP.  

# Procedure Turns  

A procedure turn barbed arrow   indicates  the direction or side of the outbound course on which  the procedure turn is made.  [Figure 1-13]  Headings are  provided for course reversal using the  $45^{\circ}$   procedure turn.  However, the point at which the turn may be commenced,  and the type and rate of turn is left to the discretion of the  pilot. Some of the options are the   $45^{\circ}$   procedure turn, the  racetrack pattern, the teardrop procedure turn, or the  $80^{\circ}/260^{\circ}$    course reversal. The absence of the procedure turn barbed  arrow in the plan view indicates that a procedure turn is  not authorized for that procedure. A maximum procedure  turn speed of not greater than 200 knots indicated airspeed  (KIAS) should be observed when turning outbound over the  IAF and throughout the procedure turn maneuver to ensure  staying within the obstruction clearance area. The normal  procedure turn distance is   $10~\mathrm{{NM}}$  . This may be reduced to  a minimum of 5 NM where only Category A or helicopter  aircraft are operated, or increased to as much as   $15~\mathrm{{NM}}$   to  accommodate high performance aircraft. Descent below the  

![](images/cc6e8965e75d489eb29ac1e3987834444a2df3d0b30e2dea2457031875d45150.jpg)  
Figure 1-13.  $45^{\circ}$   procedure turn.  

procedure turn altitude begins after the aircraft is established  on the inbound course.  

The procedure turn is  not  required when the symbol “NoPT”  appears, when radar vectoring to the final approach is  provided, when conducting a timed approach, or when the  procedure turn is not authorized. Pilots should contact the  appropriate ATC facility when in doubt if a procedure turn  is required.  

# Holding in Lieu of Procedure Turn  

A holding pattern in lieu of a procedure turn may be specified  for course reversal in some procedures.  [Figure 1-14]  In such  cases, the holding pattern is established over an intermediate  fix (IF) or a FAF. The holding pattern distance or time  specified in the profile view must be observed. Maximum  holding airspeed limitations as set forth for all holding  patterns apply. The holding pattern maneuver is completed  when the aircraft is established on the inbound course after  executing the appropriate entry. If cleared for the approach  prior to returning to the holding fix and the aircraft is at the  prescribed altitude, additional circuits of the holding pattern  are neither necessary nor expected by ATC. If pilots elect  to make additional circuits to lose excessive altitude or to  become better established on course, it is their responsibility  to advise ATC upon receipt of their approach clearance.  When holding in lieu of a procedure turn, the holding pattern  must be followed, except when RADAR VECTORING to  the final approach course is provided or when NoPT is shown  on the approach course.

Figure 1-14.  Holding in lieu of procedure turn.  

# Teardrop Procedure  

When a teardrop procedure turn is depicted and a course  reversal is required, unless otherwise authorized by ATC,  this type of procedure must be executed.  [Figure 1-15]  The  teardrop procedure consists of departure from an IAF on the  published outbound course followed by a turn toward and  intercepting the inbound course at or prior to the intermediate  fix or point. Its purpose is to permit an aircraft to reverse  direction and lose considerable altitude within reasonably  limited airspace. Where no fix is available to mark the  beginning of the intermediate segment, it shall be assumed  to commence at a point   $10\:\mathrm{{NM}}$   prior to the FAF. When the  facility is located on the airport, an aircraft is considered  to be on final approach upon completion of the penetration  turn. However, the final approach segment begins on the final  approach course  $10\:\mathrm{{NM}}$   from the facility.

# The Profile View  

The profile view is a depiction of the procedure from the side  and illustrates the vertical approach path altitudes, headings,  distances, and fixes.  [Figures 1-10, 1-11,  and  1-12]  The  view includes the minimum altitude and the maximum  distance for the procedure turn, altitudes over prescribed  fixes, distances between fixes, and the missed approach  procedure. The profile view aids in the pilot’s interpretation  of the IAP. The profile view is not drawn to scale.  [Figures 1-10, 1-11, 1-12,  and  1-16]  

The precision approach glideslope (GS) intercept altitude  is a minimum altitude for GS interception after completion  of the procedure turn, illustrated by an altitude number and  “zigzag” line. It applies to precision approaches, and except  where otherwise prescribed, also applies as a minimum  altitude for crossing the FAF when the GS is inoperative  or not used. Precision approach profiles also depict the GS  angle of descent, threshold crossing height (TCH), and GS  altitude at the outer marker (OM).  

For nonprecision approaches, a final descent is initiated and  the final segment begins at either the FAF or the final approach  point (FAP). The FAF is identified by use of the Maltese cross  symbol in the profile view   $({\pmb\bigstar})$  ).  [Figure 1-11]  When no FAF  is depicted, the final approach point is the point at which the  aircraft is established inbound on the final approach course.  [Figure 1-16]  

Stepdown fixes in nonprecision procedures are provided  between the FAF and the airport for authorizing a lower  minimum descent altitude (MDA) after passing an  obstruction. Stepdown fixes can be identified by NAVAID,  NAVAID fix, waypoint, or radar and are depicted by a hash  marked line ( ). Normally, there is only one stepdown fix  between the FAF and the MAP, but there can be several.  If the stepdown fix cannot be identified for any reason, the  minimum altitude at the stepdown fix becomes the MDA for  the approach. However, circling minimums apply if they are  higher than the stepdown fix minimum altitude, and a circling  approach is required.  

The visual descent point (VDP) is a defined point on the  final approach course of a nonprecision straight-in approach  procedure. A normal descent from the MDA to the runway  touchdown point may be commenced, provided visual  reference is established. The VDP is identified on the profile  view of the approach chart by the symbol “V.”  [Figure 1-12]  

The MAP varies depending upon the approach flown. For  the ILS, the MAP is at the decision altitude/decision height  (DA/DH). For nonprecision procedures, the pilot determines  the MAP by timing from FAF when the approach aid is away  from the airport, by a fix or NAVAID when the navigation  facility is located on the field, or by waypoints as defined  by GPS or VOR/DME RNAV. The pilot may execute the  MAP early, but pilots should, unless otherwise cleared by  ATC, fly the IAP as specified on the approach plate to the  MAP at or above the MDA or DA/DH before executing a  turning maneuver.  

A complete description of the MAP appears in the pilot  briefing section.  [Figure 1-16]  Icons indicating what is to  be accomplished at the MAP are located in the profile view.  When initiating a missed approach, the pilot is directed to  climb straight ahead (e.g., “Climb to 2,000”) or commence  a turning climb to a specified altitude (e.g., “Climbing right  turn to 2,000.”). In some cases, the procedure directs the pilot  to climb straight ahead to an initial altitude, then turn or enter  

![](images/4f1fb9ed7fa4a26831fccf37376a973a04aae3764cdba8117bbf6a89cf3a888a.jpg)  

a climbing turn to the holding altitude (e.g., “Climb to 900,  then climbing right turn to 2,500 direct ABC VOR and hold.”)  

When the MAP specifies holding at a facility or fix, the pilot  proceeds according to the missed approach track and pattern  depicted on the plan view. An alternate MAP may also be  issued by ATC. The textual description also specifies the  NAVAID(s) or radials that identify the holding fix.  

The profile view also depicts minimum, maximum,  recommended, and mandatory block altitudes used in  approaches. The minimum altitude is depicted with the  altitude underscored ( ). On final approach, aircraft are  required to maintain an altitude at or above the depicted  altitude until reaching the subsequent fix. The maximum  altitude is depicted with the altitude overscored ( ),  and aircraft must remain at or below the depicted altitude.  Mandatory altitudes are depicted with the altitude both  underscored and overscored   $({\overline{{5500}}})$  ), and altitude is to be  maintained at the depicted value. Recommended altitudes  are advisory altitudes and are neither over- nor underscored.  When an over- or underscore spans two numbers, a  mandatory block altitude is indicated, and aircraft are  required to maintain altitude within the range of the two  numbers.  [Figures 1-11  and  1-12]  

The Vertical Descent Angle (VDA) found on nonprecision  approach charts provides the pilot with information required  to establish a stabilized approach descent from the FAF or  stepdown fix to the TCH.  [Figure 1-17]  Pilots can use the  published angle and estimated or actual groundspeed to find  a target rate of descent using the rate of descent table in the  back of the TPP.

# Landing Minimums  

The minimums section sets forth the lowest altitude and  visibility requirements for the approach, whether precision  or nonprecision, straight-in or circling, or radar vectored.  When a fix is incorporated in a nonprecision final segment,  two sets of minimums may be published depending upon  how the fix can be identified. Two sets of minimums may  also be published when a second altimeter source is used  in the procedure. The minimums ensure that final approach  obstacle clearance is provided from the start of the final  segment to the runway or MAP, whichever occurs last. The  same minimums apply to both day and night operations unless  different minimums are specified in the notes section of the  pilot briefing. Published circling minimums provide obstacle  clearance when pilots remain within the appropriate area of  protection.  [Figure 1-18]  

Minimums are specified for various aircraft approach  categories based upon a value 1.3 times the stalling speed  of the aircraft in the landing configuration at maximum  certified gross landing weight. If it is necessary to maneuver  at speeds in excess of the upper limit of a speed range for a  category, the minimums for the next higher category should  be used. For example, an aircraft that falls into category  A, but is circling to land at a speed in excess of 91 knots,  should use approach category B minimums when circling  to land.  [Figure 1-19]  

The minimums for straight-in and circling appear directly  under each aircraft category.  [Figure 1-19]  When there is  no solid division line between minimums for each category  on the rows for straight-in or circling, the minimums apply  to the two or more categories.  

The terms used to describe the minimum approach altitudes  differ between precision and nonprecision approaches.  Precision approaches use DH, which is referenced to the  height above threshold elevation (HAT). Nonprecision  approaches use MDA, referenced to “feet MSL.” The MDA  is also referenced to HAT for straight-in approaches, or  height above airport (HAA) for circling approaches. On  AeroNav Products charts, the figures listed parenthetically  are for military operations and are not used in civil aviation.  

Visibility figures are provided in statute miles or runway  visual range (RVR), which is reported in hundreds of feet.  RVR is measured by a transmissometer, which represents the  horizontal distance measured at points along the runway. It  is based on the sighting of either high intensity runway lights  or on the visual contrast of other targets, whichever yields  the greater visual range. RVR is horizontal visual range, not  slant visual range, and is used in lieu of prevailing visibility  in determining minimums for a particular runway. It is  illustrated in hundreds of feet if less than a mile (i.e., “24”  is an RVR of 2,400 feet).  [Figures 1-19  and  1-20]  

Visibility figures are depicted after the DA/DH or MDA in the  minimums section. If visibility in statute miles is indicated,

an altitude number, hyphen, and a whole or fractional  number appear; for example, 530-1, which indicates “530  feet MSL” and 1 statute mile visibility. This is the descent  minimum for the approach. The RVR value is separated  from the minimum altitude with a slash, such as “1065/24,”  which indicates 1,065 feet MSL and an RVR of 2,400 feet.  If RVR is prescribed for the procedure, but not available, a  conversion table is used to provide the equivalent visibility  in this case, of  $\%$   statute mile visibility.  [Figure 1-20]  The  conversion table is also available in the TPP.  

When an alternate airport is required, standard IFR alternate  minimums apply. For aircraft other than helicopters, precision  approach procedures require a 600-feet ceiling and 2 statute  miles visibility; nonprecision approaches require an 800-feet  ceiling and 2 statute miles visibility. Helicopter alternate  minimums are a ceiling that is 200 feet above the minimum  for the approach to be flown and visibility of at least 1  statute mile, but not less than the minimum visibility for the  approach to be flown. When a black triangle with a white “A”  appears in the notes section of the pilot briefing, it indicates  non-standard IFR alternate minimums exist for the airport.  If an “NA” appears after the “A” ( ), then alternate  minimums are not authorized. This information is found in  the beginning of the TPP.  

In addition to the COPTER approaches, instrument- equipped helicopters may fly standard approach procedures.  The required visibility minimum may be reduced to one-half  the published visibility minimum for category A aircraft,  but in no case may it be reduced to less than   $\%$   mile or  1,200 feet RVR.  

Two terms are specific to helicopters. Height above landing  (HAL) means height above a designated helicopter landing  area used for helicopter IAPs. “Point in space approach”  refers to a helicopter IAP to a MAP more than 2,600 feet  from an associated helicopter landing area.  

# Airport Sketch /Airport Diagram  

Prior to all flights, pilots should take the time and study the  airport layout for all of the airports that they intend to land,  including those that may be used as an alternate. During  the flight planning phase, study the taxi procedures for the  departure airport and landing procedures for the arrival  airport. The expected taxi route should be checked against  the airport diagram or taxi chart, and special attention should  be given to the unique or complex intersections along the taxi  route. Pilots should identify critical times and locations on the  taxi route (e.g., transitioning through complex intersections,  crossing intervening runways, entering and lining up on the  runway for takeoff, and approaching and lining up on the  runway for landing).  

By knowing the layout of the airport and their particular  procedures, pilots are able to anticipate, understand, and  safely execute all ATC directives and procedures. A major  contributor to runway incursions is pilots not knowing  the airport layout and procedures. This lack of situational  awareness causes unnecessary accidents that can be avoided  by proper flight planning. The FAA believes that following  the aircraft’s progress on the airport diagram to be sure that  the instructions received from ATC are being followed is  one of the key procedures in reducing runway incursions. To  do this, pilots must take the time prior to the flight to study  all procedures so that they are not trying to learn about the  airport while they are receiving ATC instructions.  

The airport sketch, located on the bottom of the chart, includes  many helpful features. IAPs for some of the larger airports  devote an entire page to an airport diagram. Airport sketch  information concerning runway orientation, lighting, final  approach bearings, airport beacon, and obstacles all serve to  guide the pilot in the final phases of flight. See  Figure 1-21  for  a legend of airport diagram/airport sketch features (see also  Figure 1-10  for an example of an airport diagram).  

The airport elevation is indicated in a separate box at the  top left of the airport sketch. The touchdown zone elevation  (TDZE), which is the highest elevation within the first 3,000  feet of the runway, is designated at the approach end of the  procedure’s runway.  

Beneath the airport sketch is a time and speed table when  applicable. The table provides the distance and the amount  of time required to transit the distance from the FAF to the  MAP for selected groundspeeds.  

The approach lighting systems and the visual approach lights  are depicted on the airport sketch. White on black symbols   $({\pmb\bigcirc})$  ) are used for identifying pilot-controlled lighting (PCL).  Runway lighting aids are also noted (e.g., REIL, HIRL), as is  the runway centerline lighting (RCL).  [Figure 1-22]  

The airport diagram shows the paved runway configuration  in solid black, while the taxiways and aprons are shaded  gray. Other runway environment features are shown, such  as the runway identification, dimensions, magnetic heading,  displaced threshold, arresting gear, usable length, and slope.  

# Inoperative Components  

Certain procedures can be flown with inoperative components.  According to the Inoperative Components Table, for  example, an instrument landing system (ILS) approach  with a malfunctioning Medium Intensity Approach Lighting  System with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR  $=$  MALS with RAIL) can be flown if the minimum visibility is

# RNAV Instrument Approach Charts  

To avoid unnecessary duplication and proliferation of  approach charts, approach minimums for unaugmented  GPS, Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Local  Area Augmentation System (LAAS) are published on  the same approach chart as lateral navigation/vertical  navigation (LNAV/VNAV). Other types of equipment  may be authorized to conduct the approach based on the  minima notes in the front of the TPP approach chart books.  Approach charts titled “RNAV RWY XX” may be used  by aircraft with navigation systems that meet the required  navigational performance (RNP) values for each segment  of the approach.  [Figure 1-24]  

The chart may contain as many as four lines of approach  minimums: global landing system (GLS), WAAS and LAAS,  LNAV/VNAV, LNAV, and circling. LNAV/VNAV is an  instrument approach with lateral and vertical guidance with  integrity limits similar to barometric vertical navigation  (BARO VNAV).  

RNAV procedures that incorporate a final approach stepdown  fix may be published without vertical navigation on a separate  chart also titled RNAV. During a transition period when GPS  procedures are undergoing revision to a new title, both RNAV  and GPS approach charts and formats are published. ATC  clearance for the RNAV procedure authorizes a properly  certificated pilot to utilize any landing minimums for which  the aircraft is certified.  

2. 	 MDA continues to be used only for the LNAV and  circling procedures. 3. 	 TCH has been traditionally used in precision  approaches as the height of the GS above threshold.  With publication of LNAV/VNAV minimums and  RNAV descent angles, including graphically depicted  descent profiles, TCH also applies to the height of the  “descent angle,” or glidepath, at the threshold. Unless  otherwise required for larger type aircraft that may be  using the IAP, the typical TCH is 30 to 50 feet.  

The minima format changes slightly:  

1. 	 Each line of minima on the RNAV IAP is titled to  reflect the RNAV system applicable (e.g., LPV, LNAV/ VNAV, and LNAV). Circling minima is also provided. 2. 	 The minima title box also indicates the nature of the  minimum altitude for the IAP. For example: DA is  published next to the minima line title for minimums  supporting vertical guidance, and MDA is published  where the minima line supports only lateral guidance.  During an approach where an MDA is used, descent  below MDA is not authorized. 3. 	 Where two or more systems share the same minima,  each line of minima is displayed separately.  

For more information concerning government charts, the  AeroNav Products can be contacted by telephone or via their  internet address at:  

Chart terminology changes slightly to support the new  procedure types:  

1.	 DA replaces the term DH. DA conforms to the  international convention where altitudes relate to  MSL and heights relate to AGL. DA will eventually  be published for other types of IAPs with vertical  guidance, as well. DA indicates to the pilot that the  published descent profile is flown to the DA (MSL),  where a missed approach is initiated if visual references  for landing are not established. Obstacle clearance is  provided to allow a momentary descent below DA  while transitioning from the final approach to the  missed approach. The aircraft is expected to follow  the missed approach instructions while continuing  along the published final approach course to at least  the published runway threshold waypoint or MAP (if  not at the threshold) before executing any turns.

# Chapter 2  

# The Air Traffic  Control System  

# Introduction  

This chapter covers the communication equipment,  communication procedures, and air traffic control (ATC)  facilities and services available for a flight under instrument  flight rules (IFR) in the National Airspace System (NAS).  

# Communication Equipment  

# Navigation/Communication Equipment  

Civilian pilots communicate with ATC on frequencies in  the very high frequency (VHF) range between 118.000 and   $136.975\:\mathrm{MHz}$  . To derive full benefit from the ATC system,  radios capable of  $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$   spacing are required (e.g., 134.500,  134.575, 134.600). If ATC assigns a frequency that cannot  be selected, ask for an alternative frequency.  

Figure 2-1  illustrates a typical radio panel installation  consisting of a communications transceiver on the left and  a navigational receiver on the right. Many radios allow the  pilot to have one or more frequencies stored in memory and  one frequency active for transmitting and receiving (called  simplex operation). It is possible to communicate with some  flight service stations (FSS) by transmitting on   $122.1\ \mathrm{MHz}$  (selected on the communication radio) and receiving on a  VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency (selected on  the navigation radio). This is called duplex operation.  

An audio panel allows a pilot to adjust the volume of the  selected receiver(s) and to select the desired transmitter.  [Figure 2-2]  The audio panel has two positions for receiver  selection, cabin speaker, and headphone (some units might  have a center “OFF” position). Use of a hand-held microphone  and the cabin speaker introduces the distraction of reaching  for and hanging up the microphone. A headset with a boom  microphone is recommended for clear communications. The  microphone should be positioned close to the lips to reduce  

![](images/61bdd5438d62012d9498b751024a2867fa6057a1eaa26873785f575b6abad4aa.jpg)

the possibility of ambient flight deck noise interfering with  transmissions to the controller. Headphones deliver the  received signal directly to the ears; therefore, ambient noise  does not interfere with the pilot’s ability to understand the  transmission.  [Figure 2-3]  

![](images/4297a94f1e2430286bd29cc4029ab141934521309894380dde249870ebc91d28.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.  Boom microphone, headset, and push-to-talk  switch.  

Switching the transmitter selector between COM1 and  COM2 changes both transmitter and receiver frequencies.  It is necessary only when a pilot wants to monitor one  frequency while transmitting on another. One example is  listening to Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS)  on one receiver while communicating with ATC on the  other. Monitoring a navigation receiver to check for proper  identification is another reason to use the switch panel.  

Most audio switch panels also include a marker beacon  receiver. All marker beacons transmit on  $75\;\mathrm{MHz}$  , so there  is no frequency selector.  

Figure 2-4  illustrates an increasingly popular form of  navigation/communication radio; it contains a global  positioning system (GPS) receiver and a communications  transceiver. Using its navigational capability, this unit can  determine when a flight crosses an airspace boundary or fix  and can automatically select the appropriate communications  frequency for that location in the communications radio.

# Radar and Transponders  

ATC radars have a limited ability to display primary returns,  which is energy reflected from an aircraft’s metallic structure.  Their ability to display secondary returns (transponder replies  to ground interrogation signals) makes possible the many  advantages of automation.  

A transponder is a radar beacon transmitter/receiver installed  in the instrument panel. ATC beacon transmitters send out  interrogation signals continuously as the radar antenna  rotates. When an interrogation is received by a transponder, a  coded reply is sent to the ground station where it is displayed  on the controller’s scope. A reply light on the transponder  panel flickers every time it receives and replies to a radar  interrogation. Transponder codes are assigned by ATC.  

When a controller asks a pilot to “ident” and the ident button  is pushed, the return on the controller’s scope is intensified for  precise identification of a flight. When requested, briefly push  the ident button to activate this feature. It is good practice  for pilots to verbally confirm that they have changed codes  or pushed the ident button.  

# Mode  $c$   (Altitude Reporting)  

Primary radar returns indicate only range and bearing from  the radar antenna to the target; secondary radar returns can  display altitude, Mode C, on the control scope if the aircraft  is equipped with an encoding altimeter or blind encoder. In  either case, when the transponder’s function switch is in the  ALT position, the aircraft’s pressure altitude is sent to the  controller. Adjusting the altimeter’s Kollsman window has  no effect on the altitude read by the controller.  

Transponders, when installed, must be ON at all times when  operating in controlled airspace; altitude reporting is required  by regulation in Class B and Class C airspace and inside a  30-mile circle surrounding the primary airport in Class B  airspace. Altitude reporting should also be ON at all times.  

# Communication Procedures  

Clarity in communication is essential for a safe instrument  flight. This requires pilots and controllers to use terms that  are understood by both—the Pilot/Controller Glossary in the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) is the best source of  terms and definitions. The AIM is revised twice a year and  new definitions are added, so the glossary should be reviewed  frequently. Because clearances and instructions are comprised  largely of letters and numbers, a phonetic pronunciation guide  has been developed for both.  [Figure 2-5]  

ATC must follow the guidance of the Air Traffic Control  Manual when communicating with pilots. The manual  presents the controller with different situations and prescribes  precise terminology that must be used. This is advantageous  for pilots because once they have recognized a pattern or  format, they can expect future controller transmissions  to follow that format. Controllers are faced with a wide  variety of communication styles based on pilot experience,  proficiency, and professionalism.  

Pilots should study the examples in the AIM, listen to  other pilots communicate, and apply the lessons learned  to their own communications with ATC. Pilots should ask  for clarification of a clearance or instruction. If necessary,  use plain English to ensure understanding, and expect the  controller to reply in the same way. A safe instrument flight  is the result of cooperation between controller and pilot.  

# Communication Facilities  

The controller’s primary responsibility is separation of  aircraft operating under IFR. This is accomplished with ATC  facilities, to include the FSS, airport traffic control tower  (ATCT), terminal radar approach control (TRACON), and  air route traffic control center (ARTCC).  

# Flight Service Stations (FSS)  

A pilot’s first contact with ATC is usually through FSS,  either by radio or telephone. FSSs provide pilot briefings,  receive and process flight plans, relay ATC clearances,  originate Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and broadcast  aviation weather. Some facilities provide En Route Flight  Advisory Service (EFAS), take weather observations,  and advise United States Customs and Immigration of  international flights.  

Telephone contact with Flight Service can be obtained  by dialing 1-800-WX-BRIEF. This number can be used  anywhere in the United States and connects to the nearest  FSS based on the area code from which the call originates.  There are a variety of methods of making radio contact:  direct transmission, remote communication outlets (RCOs),  

![](images/871d999ee8212ad058c934bcf019412418ca9056654b0c490043bff92e253d7a.jpg)  

ground communication outlets (GCOs), and by using duplex  transmissions through navigational aids (NAVAIDs). The  best source of information on frequency usage is the Airport/ Facility Directory (A/FD) and the legend panel on sectional  charts also contains contact information.  

The briefer sends a flight plan to the host computer at the  ARTCC (Center). After processing the flight plan, the  computer sends flight strips to the tower, to the radar facility  that handles the departure route, and to the Center controller  whose sector the flight first enters.  Figure 2-6  shows a typical  strip. These strips are delivered approximately 30 minutes  prior to the proposed departure time. Strips are delivered to  en route facilities 30 minutes before the flight is expected to  enter their airspace. If a flight plan is not opened, it will “time  out” 2 hours after the proposed departure time.  

When departing an airport in Class G airspace, a pilot receives  an IFR clearance from the FSS by radio or telephone. It  contains either a clearance void time, in which case an aircraft  must be airborne prior to that time, or a release time. Pilots  should not take off prior to the release time. Pilots can help  the controller by stating how soon they expect to be airborne.  If the void time is, for example, 10 minutes past the hour and  an aircraft is airborne at exactly 10 minutes past the hour,  the clearance is void—a pilot must take off prior to the void  time. A specific void time may be requested when filing a  flight plan.  

# ATC Towers  

Several controllers in the tower cab are involved in handling  an instrument flight. Where there is a dedicated clearance  delivery position, that frequency is found in the A/FD and  on the instrument approach chart for the departure airport.  Where there is no clearance delivery position, the ground  controller performs this function. At the busiest airports, pre- taxi clearance is required; the frequency for pre-taxi clearance  can be found in the A/FD. Taxi clearance should be requested  not more than 10 minutes before proposed taxi time.  

It is recommended that pilots read their IFR clearance back to  the clearance delivery controller. Instrument clearances can  be overwhelming when attempting to copy them verbatim,  but they follow a format that allows a pilot to be prepared  when responding “Ready to copy.” The format is: clearance  limit (usually the destination airport); route, including any  departure procedure; initial altitude; frequency (for departure  control); and transponder code. With the exception of the  transponder code, a pilot knows most of these items before  engine start. One technique for clearance copying is writing  C-R-A-F-T.  

Assume an IFR flight plan has been filed from Seattle,  Washington to Sacramento, California via V-23 at 7,000  feet. Traffic is taking off to the north from Seattle-Tacoma  (Sea-Tac) airport and, by monitoring the clearance delivery  frequency, a pilot can determine the departure procedure  being assigned to southbound flights. The clearance limit  is the destination airport, so write “SAC” after the letter C.  Write “SEATTLE TWO – V23” after R for Route because  departure control issued this departure to other flights. Write  “70” after the A, the departure control frequency printed on  the approach charts for Sea-Tac after F, and leave the space  after the letter T blank—the transponder code is generated by  computer and can seldom be determined in advance. Then,  call clearance delivery and report “Ready to copy.”  

As the controller reads the clearance, check it against what  is already written down; if there is a change, draw a line  through that item and write in the changed item. Chances  are the changes are minimal, and most of the clearance is  copied before keying the microphone. Still, it is worthwhile  to develop clearance shorthand to decrease the verbiage that  must be copied (see Appendix 1).  

Pilots are required to have either the text of a departure  procedure (DP) or a graphic representation (if one is  available), and should review it before accepting a clearance.  This is another reason to find out ahead of time which DP is  in use. If the DP includes an altitude or a departure control  frequency, those items are not included in the clearance.  

The last clearance received supersedes all previous clearances.  For example, if the DP says “Climb and maintain 2,000 feet,  expect higher in 6 miles,” but upon contacting the departure  controller a new clearance is received: “Climb and maintain  8,000 feet,” the 2,000 feet restriction has been canceled. This  rule applies in both terminal and Center airspace.  

![](images/2114cc0311f5eaf851e31e976b5e703e6399e7d1a9be3ea0b6566c55d576fa9c.jpg)  
Figure 2-6.  Flight strip.  

When reporting “ready to copy” an IFR clearance before  the strip has been received from the Center computer, pilots  are advised “clearance on request.” The controller initiates  contact when it has been received. This time can be used for  taxi and pre-takeoff checks.  

The local controller is responsible for operations in the Class  D airspace and on the active runways. At some towers,  designated as IFR towers, the local controller has vectoring  authority. At visual flight rules (VFR) towers, the local  controller accepts inbound IFR flights from the terminal radar  facility and cannot provide vectors. The local controller also  coordinates flights in the local area with radar controllers.  Although Class D airspace normally extends 2,500 feet above  field elevation, towers frequently release the top 500 feet to  the radar controllers to facilitate overflights. Accordingly,  when a flight is vectored over an airport at an altitude that  appears to enter the tower controller’s airspace, there is no  need to contact the tower controller—all coordination is  handled by ATC.  

The departure radar controller may be in the same building  as the control tower, but it is more likely that the departure  radar position is remotely located. The tower controller will  not issue a takeoff clearance until the departure controller  issues a release.  

# Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON)  

TRACONs are considered terminal facilities because they  provide the link between the departure airport and the en route  structure of the NAS. Terminal airspace normally extends 30  nautical miles (NM) from the facility with a vertical extent of  10,000 feet; however, dimensions vary widely. Class B and  Class C airspace dimensions are provided on aeronautical  charts. At terminal radar facilities, the airspace is divided  into sectors, each with one or more controllers, and each  sector is assigned a discrete radio frequency. All terminal  facilities are approach controls and should be addressed  as “Approach” except when directed to do otherwise (e.g.,  “Contact departure on 120.4.”).  

Terminal radar antennas are located on or adjacent to the  airport.  Figure 2-7  shows a typical configuration. Terminal  controllers can assign altitudes lower than published  procedural altitudes called minimum vectoring altitudes  (MVAs). These altitudes are not published or accessible  to pilots, but are displayed at the controller’s position.  [Figure 2-8]  However, when pilots are assigned an altitude  that seems to be too low, they should query the controller  before descending.  

When a pilot accepts a clearance and reports ready for takeoff,  a controller in the tower contacts the TRACON for a release.  

![](images/02d4b8ce5b4a46c2cb37d573a6b5014b11d60e995f8e96f485a07f4bd220a710.jpg)

Figure 2-8.  Minimum vectoring altitude (MVA) chart.  

An aircraft is not cleared for takeoff until the departure  controller can fit the flight into the departure flow. A pilot may  have to hold for release. When takeoff clearance is received,  the departure controller is aware of the flight and is waiting  for a call. All of the information the controller needs is on  the departure strip or the computer screen; there is no need to  repeat any portion of the clearance to that controller. Simply  establish contact with the facility when instructed to do so  by the tower controller. The terminal facility computer picks  up the transponder and initiates tracking as soon as it detects  the assigned code. For this reason, the transponder should  remain on standby until takeoff clearance has been received.  

The aircraft appears on the controller’s radar display as a  target with an associated data block that moves as the aircraft  moves through the airspace. The data block includes aircraft  identification, aircraft type, altitude, and airspeed.  

A TRACON controller uses Airport Surveillance Radar  (ASR) to detect primary targets and Automated Radar  Terminal Systems (ARTS) to receive transponder signals;  the two are combined on the controller’s scope.  [Figure 2-9]  

At facilities with ASR-3 equipment, radar returns from  precipitation are not displayed as varying levels of intensity,  and controllers must rely on pilot reports and experience  to provide weather avoidance information. With ASR-9  equipment, the controller can select up to six levels of  intensity. Light precipitation does not require avoidance  tactics but precipitation levels of moderate, heavy, or  extreme should cause pilots to plan accordingly. Along  with precipitation, the pilot must additionally consider the  temperature, which if between  $-20^{\circ}$   and  $+5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   causes icing  even during light precipitation. The returns from higher levels  of intensity may obscure aircraft data blocks, and controllers  may select the higher levels only on pilot request. When  uncertainty exists about the weather ahead, ask the controller  if the facility can display intensity levels—pilots of small  aircraft should avoid intensity levels 3 or higher.  

# Tower En Route Control (TEC)  

At many locations, instrument flights can be conducted  entirely in terminal airspace. These tower en route control  (TEC) routes are generally for aircraft operating below  10,000 feet, and they can be found in the A/FD. Pilots desiring  to use TEC should include that designation in the remarks  section of the flight plan.  

Pilots are not limited to the major airports at the city pairs  listed in the A/FD. For example, a tower en route flight from  an airport in New York (NYC) airspace could terminate  at any airport within approximately 30 miles of Bradley  International (BDL) airspace, such as Hartford (HFD).  [Figure 2-10]  

A valuable service provided by the automated radar  equipment at terminal radar facilities is the Minimum Safe  Altitude Warnings (MSAW). This equipment predicts an  aircraft’s position in 2 minutes based on present path of  flight—the controller issues a safety alert if the projected  path encounters terrain or an obstruction. An unusually  rapid descent rate on a nonprecision approach can trigger  such an alert.  

# Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)  

ARTCC facilities are responsible for maintaining separation  between IFR flights in the en route structure. Center radars  (Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR)) acquire and track  transponder returns using the same basic technology as  terminal radars.  [Figure 2-11]  

Earlier Center radars display weather as an area of slashes  (light precipitation) and Hs (moderate rainfall), as illustrated  in  Figure 2-12 . Because the controller cannot detect higher  levels of precipitation, pilots should be wary of areas  showing moderate rainfall. Newer radar displays show  weather as three levels of blue. Controllers can select the  level of weather to be displayed. Weather displays of higher  levels of intensity can make it difficult for controllers to  see aircraft data blocks, so pilots should not expect ATC  to keep weather displayed continuously.  

Center airspace is divided into sectors in the same manner  as terminal airspace; additionally, most Center airspace is  divided by altitudes into high and low sectors. Each sector  has a dedicated team of controllers and a selection of radio  frequencies because each Center has a network of remote  transmitter/receiver sites. All Center frequencies can be found  in the back of the A/FD in the format shown in  Figure 2-13; they are also found on en route charts.  

Each ARTCC’s area of responsibility covers several states;  when flying from the vicinity of one remote communication  site toward another, expect to hear the same controller on  different frequencies.  

# Center Approach/Departure Control  

The majority of airports with instrument approaches do not  lie within terminal radar airspace and, when operating to or  from these airports, pilots communicate directly with the  Center controller. Departing from a tower-controlled airport,  the tower controller provides instructions for contacting the  appropriate Center controller. When departing an airport  without an operating control tower, the clearance includes  instructions such as “Upon entering controlled airspace,  contact Houston Center on 126.5.” Pilots are responsible  for terrain clearance until reaching the controller’s MVA.  Simply hearing “Radar contact” does not relieve a pilot of  this responsibility.  

If obstacles in the departure path require a steeper- than-standard climb gradient (200 feet per nautical mile  (FPNM)), then the controller advises the pilot. However,  it is the pilot’s responsibility to check the departure airport  listing in the A/FD to determine if there are trees or wires  in the departure path. When in doubt, ask the controller for  the required climb gradient.  

![](images/1b0e4083212d7c6fcf956f483d908543367f7b9b5ae365c024d1f1bfbdf55197.jpg)

The display shown provides an explanation of the symbols in the graphic. The lower figure is an example of the Digital Bright  Radar Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE) screen as seen by tower personnel. It provides tower controllers with a visual display  of the airport surveillance radar, beacon signals, and data received from ARTS III. The display shown provides an explanation of the  symbols in the graphic.

Figure 2-12.  A center controller’s scope.  

A common clearance in these situations is “When able,  proceed direct to the Astoria VOR…” The words “when able”  mean to proceed to the waypoint, intersection, or NAVAID  when the pilot is able to navigate directly to that point using  onboard available systems providing proper guidance, usable  signal, etc. If provided such guidance while flying VFR, the  pilot remains responsible for terrain and obstacle clearance.  Using the standard climb gradient, an aircraft is 2 miles  from the departure end of the runway before it is safe to  turn (400 feet above ground level (AGL)). When a Center  controller issues a heading, a direct route, or says “direct  when able,” the controller becomes responsible for terrain  and obstruction clearance.  

$\setminus$   $\setminus$   $\setminus$   $\setminus$   $\setminus$   $\setminus$  

Another common Center clearance is “Leaving (altitude)  fly (heading) or proceed direct when able.” This keeps the  terrain/obstruction clearance responsibility in the flight deck  until above the minimum IFR altitude. A controller cannot  issue an IFR clearance until an aircraft is above the minimum  IFR altitude unless it is able to climb in VFR conditions.  

On a Center controller’s scope, 1 NM is about  $\%$   of an inch.  When a Center controller is providing Approach/Departure  control services at an airport many miles from the radar  antenna, estimating headings and distances is very difficult.  Controllers providing vectors to final must set the range on  their scopes to not more than  $125\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   to provide the greatest  possible accuracy for intercept headings. Accordingly, at  locations more distant from a Center radar antenna, pilots  should expect a minimum of vectoring.  

# ATC Inflight Weather Avoidance  Assistance  

# ATC Radar Weather Displays  

ATC radar systems are able to display areas of precipitation  by sending out a beam of radio energy that is reflected back to  the radar antenna when it strikes an object or moisture, which  may be in the form of rain drops, hail, or snow. The larger  the object, or the denser its reflective surface, the stronger  the return. Radar weather processors indicate the intensity  of reflective returns in terms of decibels with respect to the  radar reflectively factor (dBZ).  

ATC systems cannot detect the presence or absence of  clouds. ATC radar systems can often determine the intensity  of a precipitation area, but the specific character of that area  (snow, rain, hail, VIRGA, etc.) cannot be determined. For  this reason, ATC refers to all weather areas displayed on  ATC radar scopes as “precipitation.”  

All ATC facilities using radar weather processors with the  ability to determine precipitation intensity describes the  intensity to pilots as:  

1. “LIGHT”	 	 (< 30 dBZ) 2. “MODERATE”	 (30 to 40 dBZ) 3. “HEAVY”	 	  ${\langle>}40$   to 50 dBZ) 4. “EXTREME”	 (>50 dBZ)  

ARTCC controllers do not use the term “LIGHT” because  their systems do not display “LIGHT” precipitation  intensities. ATC facilities that, due to equipment limitations,  cannot display the intensity levels of precipitation, describe  the location of the precipitation area by geographic position or  position relative to the aircraft. Since the intensity level is not  available, the controller states, “INTENSITY UNKNOWN.”  

ARTCC facilities normally use a Weather and Radar  Processor (WARP) to display a mosaic of data obtained from  multiple NEXRAD sites. The WARP processor is only used  in ARTCC facilities.  

There is a time delay between actual conditions and those  displayed to the controller. For example, the precipitation  data on the ARTCC controller’s display could be up to 6  minutes old. When the WARP is not available, a secondary  system, the narrowband ARSR is utilized. The ARSR system  can display two distinct levels of precipitation intensity that  is described to pilots as “MODERATE” (30 to 40 dBZ) and  “HEAVY to EXTREME”   ${(>}40$   dBZ).  

ATC radar systems cannot detect turbulence. Generally,  turbulence can be expected to occur as the rate of rainfall or  intensity of precipitation increases. Turbulence associated  with greater rates of rainfall/precipitation is normally more  severe than any associated with lesser rates of rainfall/ precipitation. Turbulence should be expected to occur near  convective activity, even in clear air. Thunderstorms are a  form of convective activity that implies severe or greater  turbulence. Operation within 20 miles of thunderstorms  should be approached with great caution, as the severity of  turbulence can be markedly greater than the precipitation  intensity might indicate.  

# Weather Avoidance Assistance  

ATC’s first duty priority is to separate aircraft and issue  safety alerts. ATC provides additional services to the extent  possible, contingent upon higher priority duties and other  factors including limitations of radar, volume of traffic,  frequency congestion, and workload. Subject to the above  factors/limitations, controllers issue pertinent information  on weather or chaff areas; and if requested, assist pilots, to  the extent possible, in avoiding areas of precipitation. Pilots  should respond to a weather advisory by acknowledging the  advisory and, if desired, requesting an alternate course of  action, such as:  

1.	 Request to deviate off course by stating the direction  and number of degrees or miles needed to deviate from  the original course; 2.	 Request a change of altitude; or	 3.	 Request routing assistance to avoid the affected  area. Because ATC radar systems cannot detect the  presence or absence of clouds and turbulence, such  assistance conveys no guarantee that the pilot will not  encounter hazards associated with convective activity.  Pilots wishing to circumnavigate precipitation areas  by a specific distance should make their desires  clearly known to ATC at the time of the request for  services. Pilots must advise ATC when they can  resume normal navigation.  

IFR pilots shall not deviate from their assigned course or  altitude without an ATC clearance. Plan ahead for possible  course deviations because hazardous convective conditions  can develop quite rapidly. This is important to consider  because the precipitation data displayed on ARTCC radar  scopes can be up to 6 minutes old, and thunderstorms can  develop at rates exceeding 6,000 feet per minute (fpm). When  encountering weather conditions that threaten the safety of  the aircraft, the pilot may exercise emergency authority as  stated in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.3 should an immediate  deviation from the assigned clearance be necessary and time  does not permit approval by ATC.  

Generally, when weather disrupts the flow of air traffic,  greater workload demands are placed on the controller.  Requests for deviations from course and other services  should be made as far in advance as possible to better  assure the controller’s ability to approve these requests  promptly. When requesting approval to detour around  weather activity, include the following information to  facilitate the request:  

1.	 The proposed point where detour commences;  2.	 The proposed route and extent of detour (direction  and distance); 3.	 The point where original route will be resumed; 4.	 Flight conditions (instrument meteorological  conditions (IMC) or visual meteorological conditions  (VMC); 5.	 Whether the aircraft is equipped with functioning  airborne radar; and 6.	 Any further deviation that may become necessary.  

To a large degree, the assistance that might be rendered  by ATC depends upon the weather information available  to controllers. Due to the extremely transitory nature of  hazardous weather, the controller’s displayed precipitation  information may be of limited value.  

Obtaining IFR clearance or approval to circumnavigate  hazardous weather can often be accommodated more readily  in the en route areas away from terminals because there  is usually less congestion and, therefore, greater freedom  of action. In terminal areas, the problem is more acute  because of traffic density, ATC coordination requirements,  complex departure and arrival routes, and adjacent airports.  As a consequence, controllers are less likely to be able to  accommodate all requests for weather detours in a terminal  area. Nevertheless, pilots should not hesitate to advise  controllers of any observed hazardous weather and should  specifically advise controllers if they desire circumnavigation  of observed weather.  

Pilot reports (PIREPs) of flight conditions help define the  nature and extent of weather conditions in a particular area.  These reports are disseminated by radio and electronic means  to other pilots. Provide PIREP information to ATC regarding  pertinent flight conditions, such as:  

1.	 Turbulence; 2.	 Visibility;  

3.	 Cloud tops and bases; and 4.	 The presence of hazards such as ice, hail, and lightning.  

# Approach Control Facility  

An approach control facility is a terminal ATC facility  that provides approach control service in the terminal area.  Services are provided for arriving and departing VFR and  IFR aircraft and, on occasion, en route aircraft. In addition,  for airports with parallel runways with ILS or LDA  approaches, the approach control facility provides monitoring  of the approaches.  

# Approach Control Advances  

Precision Runway Monitor (PRM)  

Over the past few years, a new technology has been installed  at airports that permits a decreased separation distance  between parallel runways. The system is called a Precision  Runway Monitor (PRM) and is comprised of high-update  radar, high-resolution ATC displays, and PRM-certified  controllers.  [Figure 2-14]  

![](images/4276f7ef57c094a0728591af24f6b89d1f7f6c0ab931018df3d322bccde3fa71.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.  High-resolution ATC displays used in PRM.  

# PRM Radar  

The PRM uses a Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar  (MSSR) that employs electronically-scanned antennas.  Because the PRM has no scan rate restrictions, it is capable  of providing a faster update rate (up to 1.0 second) over  conventional systems, thereby providing better target  presentation in terms of accuracy, resolution, and track  prediction. The system is designed to search, track, process,  and display SSR-equipped aircraft within airspace of over  30 miles in range and over 15,000 feet in elevation. Visual  and audible alerts are generated to warn controllers to take  corrective actions.  

# PRM Benefits  

Typically, PRM is used with dual approaches with  centerlines separated less than 4,300 feet but not less  than 3,000 feet (under most conditions).  [Figure 2-15] Separating the two final approach courses is a No  Transgression Zone (NTZ) with surveillance of that zone  provided by two controllers, one for each active approach.  The system tracking software provides PRM monitor  controllers with aircraft identification, position, speed,  projected position, as well as visual and aural alerts.  

# Control Sequence  

The IFR system is flexible and accommodating if pilots  do their homework, have as many frequencies as possible  written down before they are needed, and have an alternate  in mind if the flight cannot be completed as planned.  Pilots should familiarize themselves with all the facilities  and services available along the planned route of flight.  [Figure 2-16]  Always know where the nearest VFR  conditions can be found, and be prepared to head in that  direction if the situation deteriorates.  

A typical IFR flight, with departure and arrival at airports with  control towers, would use the ATC facilities and services in  the following sequence:  

1.	 FSS: Obtain a weather briefing for a departure,  destination and alternate airports, and en route  conditions, and then file a flight plan by calling  1-800-WX-BRIEF. 2.	 ATIS: Preflight complete, listen for present conditions  and the approach in use. 3.	 Clearance Delivery: Prior to taxiing, obtain a  departure clearance.  

![](images/2d7f3b9c20849bd7215d631930a7b199b200cd3066b44ed88e554fbc8f2bd2b5.jpg)

4.	 Ground Control: Noting that the flight is IFR, receive  taxi instructions.

 5.	 Tower: Pre-takeoff checks complete, receive clearance  to takeoff.

 6.	 Departure Control: Once the transponder “tags up”  with the ARTS, the tower controller instructs the pilot  to contact Departure to establish radar contact.

 7.	 ARTCC: After departing the departure controller’s  airspace, aircraft is handed off to Center, who  coordinates the flight while en route. Pilots may  be in contact with multiple ARTCC facilities; they  coordinate the hand-offs.

 8.	 EFAS/ Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service  (HIWAS): Coordinate with ATC before leaving their  frequency to obtain inflight weather information.

 9.	 ATIS: Coordinate with ATC before leaving their  frequency to obtain ATIS information.

 10.	 Approach Control: Center hands off to approach  control where pilots receive additional information  and clearances.

 11.	 Tower: Once cleared for the approach, pilots are  instructed to contact tower control; the flight plan is  canceled by the tower controller upon landing.  

3.	 ARTCC: After takeoff, establish contact with Center.  During the flight, pilots may be in contact with multiple  ARTCC facilities; ATC coordinates the hand-offs. 4.	 EFAS/HIWAS: Coordinate with ATC before leaving  their frequency to obtain inflight weather information. 5.	 Approach Control: Center hands off to approach  control where pilots receive additional information  and clearances. If a landing under VMC is possible,  pilots may cancel their IFR clearance before landing.  

# Letters of Agreement (LOA)  

The ATC system is indeed a system and very little happens by  chance. As a flight progresses, controllers in adjoining sectors  or adjoining Centers coordinate its handling by telephone  or by computer. Where there is a boundary between the  airspace controlled by different facilities, the location and  altitude for hand-off is determined by Letters of Agreement  (LOA) negotiated between the two facility managers. This  information is not available to pilots in any Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) publication. For this reason, it is good  practice to note on the en route chart the points at which  hand-offs occur. Each time a flight is handed off to a different  facility, the controller knows the altitude and location—this  was part of the hand-off procedure.  

A typical IFR flight, with departure and arrival at airports  without operating control towers, would use the ATC  facilities and services in the following sequence:  

1.	 FSS: Obtain a weather briefing for departure,  destination, and alternate airports, and en route  conditions, and then file a flight plan by calling  1-800-WX-BRIEF. Provide the latitude/longitude  description for small airports to ensure that Center is  able to locate departure and arrival locations. 2.	 FSS or UNICOM: ATC clearances can be filed and  received on the UNICOM frequency if the licensee  has made arrangements with the controlling ARTCC;  otherwise, file with FSS via telephone. Be sure all  preflight preparations are complete before filing. The  clearance includes a clearance void time. Pilots must  be airborne prior to the void time.  

# Chapter 3 Human  Factors  

# Introduction  

Human factors is a broad field that examines the interaction  between people, machines, and the environment for the  purpose of improving performance and reducing errors. As  aircraft became more reliable and less prone to mechanical  failure, the percentage of accidents related to human factors  increased. Some aspect of human factors now accounts for  over 80 percent of all accidents. Pilots, who have a good  understanding of human factors, are better equipped to plan  and execute a safe and uneventful flight.  

Flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) can  result in sensations that are misleading to the body’s sensory  system. A safe pilot needs to understand these sensations and  effectively counteract them. Instrument flying requires a  pilot  to make decisions using all available resources.  

The elements of human factors covered in this chapter include  sensory systems used for orientation and illusions in flight.  For more information about physiological and psychological  factors, medical factors, aeronautical decision-making  (ADM), and crew resource management (CRM), refer to the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.  

altitude does not restore a pilot’s vision in the same transitory  period used at the climb altitude.  

# Sensory Systems for Orientation  

Orientation is the awareness of the position of the aircraft  and of oneself in relation to a specific reference point.  Disorientation is the lack of orientation, and spatial  disorientation specifically refers to the lack of orientation  with regard to position in space and to other objects.  

The eye also has two blind spots. The day blind spot is the  location on the light sensitive retina where the optic nerve  fiber bundle (which carries messages from the eye to the  brain) passes through. This location has no light receptors,  and a message cannot be created there to be sent to the brain.  The night blind spot is due to a concentration of cones in an  area surrounding the fovea on the retina. Because there are  no rods in this area, direct vision on an object at night will  disappear. As a result, off-center viewing and scanning at  night is best for both obstacle avoidance and to maximize  situational awareness (SA). (See the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge and the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM) for detailed reading.)  

Orientation is maintained through the body’s sensory organs  in three areas: visual, vestibular, and postural. The eyes  maintain visual orientation. The motion sensing system in  the inner ear maintains vestibular orientation. The nerves in  the skin, joints, and muscles of the body maintain postural  orientation. When healthy human beings are in their natural  environment, these three systems work well. When the  human body is subjected to the forces of flight, these senses  can provide misleading information. It is this misleading  information that causes pilots to become disoriented.  

The brain also processes visual information based upon color,  relationship of colors, and vision from objects around us.  Figure 3-1  demonstrates the visual processing of information.  The brain assigns color based on many items, to include an  object’s surroundings. In the figure below, the orange square  on the shaded side of the cube is actually the same color  as the brown square in the center of the cube’s top face.  

# Eyes  

Of all the senses, vision is most important in providing  information to maintain safe flight. Even though the human  eye is optimized for day vision, it is also capable of vision  in very low light environments. During the day, the eye uses  receptors called cones, while at night, vision is facilitated

Figure 3-1.  Rubik’s cube graphic depicting the visual processing of information.  

these provide a level of vision  optimized for the lighting  conditions that they were  intended. That is, cones are  ineffective at night and rods  are ineffective during the day.  

Rods, which contain rhodopsin  (called visual purple), are  especially sensitive to light  and increased light washes out  the rhodopsin compromising  the night vision. Hence, when  strong light is momentarily  introduced at night, vision  may be totally ineffective as  the rods take time to become  effective again in darkness.  Smoking, alcohol, oxygen  deprivation, and age affect  vision, especially at night. It  should be noted that at night,  oxygen deprivation, such  as one caused from a climb  to a high altitude, causes a  significant reduction in vision.  A return back to the lower  

Isolating the orange square from surrounding influences  will reveal that it is actually brown. The application to a real  environment is evident when processing visual information  that is influenced by surroundings. The ability to pick out an  airport in varied terrain or another aircraft in a light haze are  examples of problems with interpretation that make vigilance  all the more necessary.  

Figure 3-2  illustrates problems with perception. Both tables  are the same lengths. Objects are easily misinterpreted in  size to include both length and width. Being accustomed to  a 75-foot-wide runway on flat terrain is most likely going to  influence a pilot’s perception of a wider runway on uneven  terrain simply because of the inherent processing experience.  

# Vision Under Dim and Bright Illumination  

Under conditions of dim illumination, aeronautical charts and  aircraft instruments can become unreadable unless adequate  flight deck lighting is available. In darkness, vision becomes  more sensitive to light. This process is called dark adaptation.  Although exposure to total darkness for at least 30 minutes is  required for complete dark adaptation, a pilot can achieve a  moderate degree of dark adaptation within 20 minutes under  dim red flight deck lighting.  

Red light distorts colors (filters the red spectrum), especially  on aeronautical charts, and makes it very difficult for the  eyes to focus on objects inside the aircraft. Pilots should  use it only where optimum outside night vision capability is  necessary. White flight deck lighting (dim lighting) should  be available when needed for map and instrument reading,  especially under IMC conditions.  

Since any degree of dark adaptation is lost within a few  seconds of viewing a bright light, pilots should close one eye  when using a light to preserve some degree of night vision.  During night flights in the vicinity of lightning, flight deck  lights should be turned up to help prevent loss of night vision  due to the bright flashes. Dark adaptation is also impaired by  exposure to cabin pressure altitudes above 5,000 feet, carbon  monoxide inhaled through smoking, deficiency of Vitamin  A in the diet, and prolonged exposure to bright sunlight.  

During flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC),  the eyes are the major orientation source and usually  provide accurate and reliable information. Visual cues  usually prevail over false sensations from other sensory  systems. When these visual cues are taken away, as they  are in IMC, false sensations can cause the pilot to quickly  become disoriented.  

An effective way to counter these false sensations is to  recognize the problem, disregard the false sensations, rely  on the flight instruments, and use the eyes to determine the  aircraft attitude. The pilot must have an understanding of  the problem and the skill to control the aircraft using only  instrument indications.

# Ears  

The inner ear has two major parts concerned with orientation:  the semicircular canals and the otolith organs.  [Figure 3-3]  The  semicircular canals detect angular acceleration of the body,  while the otolith organs detect linear acceleration and gravity.  The semicircular canals consist of three tubes at approximate  right angles to each other, each located on one of three axes:  pitch, roll, or yaw as illustrated in  Figure 3-4 . Each canal is  filled with a fluid called endolymph fluid. In the center of  the canal is the cupola, a gelatinous structure that rests upon  sensory hairs located at the end of the vestibular nerves. It  is the movement of these hairs within the fluid that causes  sensations of motion.  

Because of the friction between the fluid and the canal, it  may take about 15–20 seconds for the fluid in the ear canal  to reach the same speed as the canal’s motion.  

To illustrate what happens during a turn, visualize the  aircraft in straight-and-level flight. With no acceleration of  the aircraft, the hair cells are upright, and the body senses  that no turn has occurred. Therefore, the position of the hair  cells and the actual sensation correspond.  

Placing the aircraft into a turn puts the semicircular canal and  its fluid into motion, with the fluid within the semicircular  canal lagging behind the accelerated canal walls.  [Figure 3-5] This lag creates a relative movement of the fluid within the  canal. The canal wall and the cupula move in the opposite  direction from the motion of the fluid.  

The brain interprets the movement of the hairs to be a turn in  the same direction as the canal wall. The body correctly senses  that a turn is being made. If the turn continues at a constant  rate for several seconds or longer, the motion of the fluid in  

![](images/904e3c2e1928ff6d3029808b54a2d18ef416237668d84e3b54445d657dc50118.jpg)

Figure 3-5.  Angular acceleration.  

the canals catches up with the canal walls. The hairs are no  longer bent, and the brain receives the false impression that  turning has stopped. Thus, the position of the hair cells and  the resulting sensation during a prolonged, constant turn in  either direction results in the false sensation of no turn.  

When the aircraft returns to straight-and-level flight, the fluid  in the canal moves briefly in the opposite direction. This sends  a signal to the brain that is falsely interpreted as movement  in the opposite direction. In an attempt to correct the falsely  perceived turn, the pilot may reenter the turn placing the  aircraft in an out-of-control situation.  

The otolith organs detect linear acceleration and gravity in a  similar way. Instead of being filled with a fluid, a gelatinous  membrane containing chalk-like crystals covers the sensory  hairs. When the pilot tilts his or her head, the weight of these  crystals causes this membrane to shift due to gravity, and  the sensory hairs detect this shift. The brain orients this new  position to what it perceives as vertical. Acceleration and  deceleration also cause the membrane to shift in a similar  manner. Forward acceleration gives the illusion of the head  tilting backward.  [Figure 3-6]   As a result, during takeoff and  while accelerating, the pilot may sense a steeper than normal  climb resulting in a tendency to nose-down.  

# Nerves  

Nerves in the body’s skin, muscles, and joints constantly  send signals to the brain, which signals the body’s relation to  gravity. These signals tell the pilot his or her current position.  Acceleration is felt as the pilot is pushed back into the seat.  Forces, created in turns, can lead to false sensations of the  true direction of gravity and may give the pilot a false sense  of which way is up.  

Uncoordinated turns, especially climbing turns, can cause  misleading signals to be sent to the brain. Skids and slips  give the sensation of banking or tilting. Turbulence can create  motions that confuse the brain as well. Pilots need to be aware  that fatigue or illness can exacerbate these sensations and  ultimately lead to subtle incapacitation.

# Illusions Leading to Spatial  Disorientation  

The sensory system responsible for most of the illusions  leading to spatial disorientation is the vestibular system.  Visual illusions can also cause spatial disorientation.  

# Vestibular Illusions The Leans  

A condition called “the leans” can result when a banked  attitude, to the left for example, may be entered too slowly  to set in motion the fluid in the “roll” semicircular tubes.  [Figure 3-5]  An abrupt correction of this attitude sets the  fluid in motion, creating the illusion of a banked attitude to  the right. The disoriented pilot may make the error of rolling  the aircraft into the original left banked attitude, or if level  flight is maintained, feel compelled to lean in the perceived  vertical plane until this illusion subsides.  

# Coriolis Illusion  

The coriolis illusion occurs when a pilot has been in a turn  long enough for the fluid in the ear canal to move at the same  speed as the canal. A movement of the head in a different  plane, such as looking at something in a different part of the  flight deck, may set the fluid moving and create the illusion  of turning or accelerating on an entirely different axis.  This action causes the pilot to think the aircraft is doing a  maneuver that it is not. The disoriented pilot may maneuver  the aircraft into a dangerous attitude in an attempt to correct  the aircraft’s perceived attitude.  

For this reason, it is important that pilots develop an  instrument cross-check or scan that involves minimal  head movement. Take care when retrieving charts and  other objects in the flight deck—if something is dropped,  retrieve it with minimal head movement and be alert for  the coriolis illusion.  

# Graveyard Spiral  

As in other illusions, a pilot in a prolonged coordinated,  constant-rate turn, will have the illusion of not turning. During  the recovery to level flight, the pilot experiences the sensation  of turning in the opposite direction. The disoriented pilot may  return the aircraft to its original turn. Because an aircraft tends  to lose altitude in turns unless the pilot compensates for the  loss in lift, the pilot may notice a loss of altitude. The absence  of any sensation of turning creates the illusion of being in a  level descent. The pilot may pull back on the controls in an  attempt to climb or stop the descent. This action tightens the  spiral and increases the loss of altitude; hence, this illusion is  referred to as a graveyard spiral.  [Figure 3-7]  At some point,  this could lead to a loss of control by the pilot.  

# Somatogravic Illusion  

A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff,  stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the  head backwards. This action creates the somatogravic illusion  of being in a nose-up attitude, especially in situations without  good visual references. The disoriented pilot may push the  aircraft into a nose-low or dive attitude. A rapid deceleration  by quick reduction of the throttle(s) can have the opposite  effect with the disoriented pilot pulling the aircraft into a  nose-up or stall attitude.  

# Inversion Illusion  

An abrupt change from climb to straight-and-level flight can  stimulate the otolith organs enough to create the illusion of  tumbling backwards or inversion illusion. The disoriented  pilot may push the aircraft abruptly into a nose-low attitude,  possibly intensifying this illusion.  

# Elevator Illusion  

An abrupt upward vertical acceleration, as can occur in  an updraft, can stimulate the otolith organs to create the  illusion of being in a climb. This is called elevator illusion.  The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low  

![](images/7f35d6c76a58811c26fc641ff23713ed93894f8a785e631f8b2c8dca61863a3e.jpg)  
Figure 3-7.  Graveyard spiral.  

attitude. An abrupt downward vertical acceleration, usually  in a downdraft, has the opposite effect with the disoriented  pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose-up attitude.  

# Visual Illusions  

Visual illusions are especially hazardous because pilots rely  on their eyes for correct information. Two illusions that lead  to spatial disorientation, false horizon and autokinesis, are  concerned with only the visual system.  

# False Horizon  

A sloping cloud formation, an obscured horizon, an aurora  borealis, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars,  and certain geometric patterns of ground lights can provide  inaccurate visual information, or false horizon, for aligning  the aircraft correctly with the actual horizon. The disoriented  pilot may place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude.  

# Autokinesis  

In the dark, a stationary light will appear to move about when  stared at for many seconds. The disoriented pilot could lose  control of the aircraft in attempting to align it with the false  movements of this light called autokinesis.  

# Postural Considerations  

The postural system sends signals from the skin, joints, and  muscles to the brain that are interpreted in relation to the  Earth’s gravitational pull. These signals determine posture.  Inputs from each movement update the body’s position to  the brain on a constant basis. “Seat of the pants” flying is  largely dependent upon these signals. Used in conjunction  with visual and vestibular clues, these sensations can be  fairly reliable. However, because of the forces acting upon  the body in certain flight situations, many false sensations  can occur due to acceleration forces overpowering gravity.  [Figure 3-8]  These situations include uncoordinated turns,  climbing turns, and turbulence.  

# Demonstration of Spatial Disorientation  

There are a number of controlled aircraft maneuvers a pilot  can perform to experiment with spatial disorientation. While  each maneuver normally creates a specific illusion, any false  sensation is an effective demonstration of disorientation. Thus,  even if there is no sensation during any of these maneuvers,  the absence of sensation is still an effective demonstration  in that it shows the inability to detect bank or roll. There are  several objectives in demonstrating these various maneuvers.  

1.	 They teach pilots to understand the susceptibility of  the human system to spatial disorientation. 2.	 They demonstrate that judgments of aircraft attitude  based on bodily sensations are frequently false. 3.	 They help lessen the occurrence and degree of  disorientation through a better understanding of the  relationship between aircraft motion, head movements,  and resulting disorientation. 4.	 They help instill a greater confidence in relying on  flight instruments for assessing true aircraft attitude.  

![](images/a331b3af2eb44540d4988a3b9cf6f66dc2ad0c1751eb2d882856d858e49dba08.jpg)  
Skid, slip, and uncoordinated turns feel alike.  Pilots feel they are being forced sideways in their seat.  

A pilot should not attempt any of these maneuvers at  low altitudes or in the absence of an instructor pilot or an  appropriate safety pilot.  

# Climbing While Accelerating  

With the pilot’s eyes closed, the instructor pilot maintains  approach airspeed in a straight-and-level attitude for several  seconds, and then accelerates while maintaining straight- and-level attitude. The usual illusion during this maneuver,  without visual references, is that the aircraft is climbing.  

# Climbing While Turning  

With the pilot’s eyes still closed and the aircraft in a straight- and-level attitude, the instructor pilot now executes, with a  relatively slow entry, a well-coordinated turn of about 1.5  positive G (approximately   $50^{\circ}$   bank) for   $90^{\circ}$  . While in the  turn, without outside visual references and under the effect of  the slight positive G, the usual illusion produced is that of a  climb. Upon sensing the climb, the pilot should immediately  open the eyes and see that a slowly established, coordinated  turn produces the same feeling as a climb.  

# Diving While Turning  

Repeating the previous procedure, with the exception that  the pilot’s eyes should be kept closed until recovery from  the turn is approximately one-half completed can create this  sensation. With the eyes closed, the usual illusion is that the  aircraft is diving.  

# Tilting to Right or Left  

While in a straight-and-level attitude, with the pilot’s eyes  closed, the instructor pilot executes a moderate or slight  skid to the left with wings level. This creates the illusion of  the body being tilted to the right. The same illusion can be  sensed with a skid to the right with wings level, except the  body feels it is being tilted to the left.  

# Reversal of Motion  

This illusion can be demonstrated in any of the three planes of  motion. While straight and level, with the pilot’s eyes closed,  the instructor pilot smoothly and positively rolls the aircraft  to approximately a  $45^{\circ}$   bank attitude. This creates the illusion  of a strong sense of rotation in the opposite direction. After  this illusion is noted, the pilot should open his or her eyes  and observe that the aircraft is in a banked attitude.  

# Diving or Rolling Beyond the Vertical Plane  

This maneuver may produce extreme disorientation. While  in straight-and-level flight, the pilot should sit normally,  either with eyes closed or gaze lowered to the floor. The  instructor pilot starts a positive, coordinated roll toward a   $30^{\circ}$   or   $40^{\circ}$   angle of bank. As this is in progress, the pilot  tilts his or her head forward, looks to the right or left, then  immediately returns his or her head to an upright position.  The instructor pilot should time the maneuver so the roll is  stopped as the pilot returns his or her head upright. An intense  disorientation is usually produced by this maneuver, and the  pilot experiences the sensation of falling downward into the  direction of the roll.  

In the descriptions of these maneuvers, the instructor pilot is  doing the flying, but having the pilot do the flying can also  be a very effective demonstration. The pilot should close his  or her eyes and tilt their head to one side. The instructor pilot  tells the pilot what control inputs to perform. The pilot then  attempts to establish the correct attitude or control input with  eyes closed and head tilted. While it is clear the pilot has no  idea of the actual attitude, he or she will react to what the  senses are saying. After a short time, the pilot will become  disoriented, and the instructor pilot then tells the pilot to  look up and recover. The benefit of this exercise is the pilot  experiences the disorientation while flying the aircraft.  

# Coping with Spatial Disorientation  

To prevent illusions and their potentially disastrous  consequences, pilots can:  

1.	 Understand the causes of these illusions and remain  constantly alert for them. Take the opportunity to  understand and then experience spatial disorientation  illusions in a device, such as a Barany chair, a  Vertigon, or a Virtual Reality Spatial Disorientation  Demonstrator. 2.	 Always obtain and understand preflight weather  briefings. 3.	 Before flying in marginal visibility (less than 3 miles)  or where a visible horizon is not evident such as flight  over open water during the night, obtain training and  maintain proficiency in airplane control by reference  to instruments.  4.	 Do not continue flight into adverse weather conditions  or into dusk or darkness unless proficient in the use of  flight instruments. If intending to fly at night, maintain  night-flight currency and proficiency. Include cross- country and local operations at various airfields. 5.	 Ensure that when outside visual references are used,  they are reliable, fixed points on the Earth’s surface. 6.	 Avoid sudden head movement, particularly during  takeoffs, turns, and approaches to landing. 7.	 Be physically tuned for flight into reduced visibility.  Ensure proper rest, adequate diet, and, if flying at  night, allow for night adaptation. Remember that  illness, medication, alcohol, fatigue, sleep loss, and  

mild hypoxia are likely to increase susceptibility to  spatial disorientation.  

8.	 Most importantly, become proficient in the use of  flight instruments and rely upon them. Trust the  instruments and disregard your sensory perceptions.  

The sensations that lead to illusions during instrument  flight conditions are normal perceptions experienced by  pilots. These undesirable sensations cannot be completely  prevented, but through training and awareness, pilots can  ignore or suppress them by developing absolute reliance  on the flight instruments. As pilots gain proficiency in  instrument flying, they become less susceptible to these  illusions and their effects.  

# Optical Illusions  

Of the senses, vision is the most important for safe  flight. However, various terrain features and atmospheric  conditions can create optical illusions. These illusions  are primarily associated with landing. Since pilots  must transition from reliance on instruments to visual  cues outside the flight deck for landing at the end of an  instrument approach, it is imperative they be aware of the  potential problems associated with these illusions and take  appropriate corrective action. The major illusions leading  to landing errors are described below.  

# Runway Width Illusion  

A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion the  aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is, especially  when runway length-to-width relationships are comparable.  [Figure 3-9A]  The pilot who does not recognize this illusion  will fly a lower approach with the risk of striking objects  along the approach path or landing short. A wider-than-usual  runway can have the opposite effect with the risk of leveling  out high and landing hard or overshooting the runway.  

# Runway and Terrain Slopes Illusion  

An upsloping runway, upsloping terrain, or both can create  an illusion the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually  is.  [Figure 3-9B]  The pilot who does not recognize this  illusion will fly a lower approach. Downsloping runways and  downsloping approach terrain can have the opposite effect.  

# Featureless Terrain Illusion  

An absence of surrounding ground features, as in an  overwater approach, over darkened areas, or terrain made  featureless by snow, can create an illusion the aircraft is at  a higher altitude than it actually is. This illusion, sometimes  referred to as the “black hole approach,” causes pilots to fly  a lower approach than is desired.  

# Water Refraction  

Rain on the windscreen can create an illusion of being at a  higher altitude due to the horizon appearing lower than it is.  This can result in the pilot flying a lower approach.  

# Haze  

Atmospheric haze can create an illusion of being at a greater  distance and height from the runway. As a result, the pilot  has a tendency to be low on the approach. Conversely,  extremely clear air (clear bright conditions of a high attitude  airport) can give the pilot the illusion of being closer than  he or she actually is, resulting in a high approach that may  cause an overshoot or go around. The diffusion of light due  to water particles on the windshield can adversely affect  depth perception. The lights and terrain features normally  used to gauge height during landing become less effective  for the pilot.  

# Fog  

Flying into fog can create an illusion of pitching up. Pilots  who do not recognize this illusion often steepen the approach  quite abruptly.  

# Ground Lighting Illusions  

Lights along a straight path, such as a road or lights on  moving trains, can be mistaken for runway and approach  lights. Bright runway and approach lighting systems,  especially where few lights illuminate the surrounding  terrain, may create the illusion of less distance to the  runway. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion will  often fly a higher approach.  

# How To Prevent Landing Errors Due to  Optical Illusions  

To prevent these illusions and their potentially hazardous  consequences, pilots can:  

1.	 Anticipate the possibility of visual illusions during  approaches to unfamiliar airports, particularly at night  or in adverse weather conditions. Consult airport  diagrams and the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD)  for information on runway slope, terrain, and lighting. 2.	 Make frequent reference to the altimeter, especially  during all approaches, day and night. 3.	 If possible, conduct aerial visual inspection of  unfamiliar airports before landing. 4.	 Use Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) or  Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) systems  for a visual reference or an electronic glideslope,  whenever they are available.

# Aerodynamic  Factors  

# Introduction  

Several factors affect aircraft performance including the  atmosphere, aerodynamics, and aircraft icing. Pilots need an  understanding of these factors for a sound basis for prediction  of aircraft response to control inputs, especially with regard  to instrument approaches, while holding, and when operating  at reduced airspeed in instrument meteorological conditions  (IMC). Although these factors are important to the pilot flying  visual flight rules (VFR), they must be even more thoroughly  understood by the pilot operating under instrument flight  rules (IFR). Instrument pilots rely strictly on instrument  indications to precisely control the aircraft; therefore, they  must have a solid understanding of basic aerodynamic  principles in order to make accurate judgments regarding  aircraft control inputs.  

# The Wing  

To understand aerodynamic forces, a pilot needs to  understand basic terminology associated with airfoils.  Figure 4-1  illustrates a typical airfoil.  

The chord line is the straight line intersecting the leading  and trailing edges of the airfoil, and the term chord refers  to the chord line longitudinal length (length as viewed from  the side).  

The mean camber is a line located halfway between the  upper and lower surfaces. Viewing the wing edgewise, the  mean camber connects with the chord line at each end. The  mean camber is important because it assists in determining  aerodynamic qualities of an airfoil. The measurement of  the maximum camber; inclusive of both the displacement  of the mean camber line and its linear measurement from  the end of the chord line, provide properties useful in  evaluating airfoils.  

# Review of Basic Aerodynamics  

The instrument pilot must understand the relationship  and differences between several factors that affect the  performance of an aircraft in flight. Also, it is crucial to  understand how the aircraft reacts to various control and  power changes, because the environment in which instrument  pilots fly has inherent hazards not found in visual flying. The  basis for this understanding is found in the four forces acting  on an aircraft and Newton’s Three Laws of Motion.  

Relative Wind  is the direction of the airflow with respect to  an airfoil.  

Angle of Attack (AOA)  is the acute angle measured between  the relative wind, or flightpath and the chord of the airfoil.  [Figure 4-2]  

![](images/9835028b28108dd63fb6a720bed52f281807314a73058462594e4c5638c1da39.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.  Angle of attack and relative wind.  

Flightpath  is the course or track along which the aircraft is  flying or is intended to be flown.  

# The Four Forces  

The four basic forces  [Figure 4-3]  acting upon an aircraft in  flight are lift, weight, thrust, and drag.  

# Lift  

Lift is a component of the total aerodynamic force on an  airfoil and acts perpendicular to the relative wind. Relative  wind is the direction of the airflow with respect to an airfoil.  This force acts straight up from the average (called mean)  center of pressure (CP), which is called the center of lift. It  should be noted that it is a point along the chord line of an  airfoil through which all aerodynamic forces are considered  to act. The magnitude of lift varies proportionately with  speed, air density, shape and size of the airfoil, and AOA.  During straight-and-level flight, lift and weight are equal.  

![](images/758b1d8177333ce4489dc6acf2e27a81677e1a0c1918f2608ac29b271451b867.jpg)

Figure 4-3.  The four forces and three axes of rotation.  

# Weight  

Weight is the force exerted by an aircraft from the pull of  gravity. It acts on an aircraft through its center of gravity (CG)  and is straight down. This should not be confused with the  center of lift, which can be significantly different from the  CG. As an aircraft is descending, weight is greater than lift.  

# Thrust  

Thrust is the forward force produced by the powerplant/ propeller or rotor. It opposes or overcomes the force of drag.  As a general rule, it acts parallel to the longitudinal axis.  

# Drag  

Drag is the net aerodynamic force parallel to the relative  wind and is generally a sum of two components: induced  drag and parasite drag.  

# Induced Drag  

Induced drag is caused from the creation of lift and increases  with AOA. Therefore, if the wing is not producing lift, induced  drag is zero. Conversely, induced drag decreases with airspeed.  

Parasite Drag  

Parasite drag is all drag not caused from the production of  lift. Parasite drag is created by displacement of air by the  aircraft, turbulence generated by the airfoil, and the hindrance  of airflow as it passes over the surface of the aircraft or  components. All of these forces create drag not from the  production of lift but the movement of an object through an  air mass. Parasite drag increases with speed and includes skin  friction drag, interference drag, and form drag.  

# • Skin Friction Drag  

Covering the entire “wetted” surface of the aircraft is a thin  layer of air called a boundary layer. The air molecules on the  surface have zero velocity in relation to the surface; however,  the layer just above moves over the stagnant molecules  below because it is pulled along by a third layer close to  the free stream of air. The velocities of the layers increase  as the distance from the surface increases until free stream  velocity is reached, but all are affected by the free stream.  The distance (total) between the skin surface and where free  stream velocity is reached is called the boundary layer. At  subsonic levels the cumulative layers are about the thickness  of a playing card, yet their motion sliding over one another  creates a drag force. This force retards motion due to the  viscosity of the air and is called skin friction drag. Because  skin friction drag is related to a large surface area its affect  on smaller aircraft is small versus large transport aircraft  where skin friction drag may be considerable.  

# • Interference Drag  

Interference drag is generated by the collision of airstreams  creating eddy currents, turbulence, or restrictions to smooth  flow. For instance, the airflow around a fuselage and around  the wing meet at some point, usually near the wing’s root.  These airflows interfere with each other causing a greater drag  than the individual values. This is often the case when external  items are placed on an aircraft. That is, the drag of each item  individually, added to that of the aircraft, are less than that  of the two items when allowed to interfere with one another.  

# • Form Drag  

Form drag is the drag created because of the shape of a  component or the aircraft. If one were to place a circular  disk in an air stream, the pressure on both the top and bottom  would be equal. However, the airflow starts to break down  as the air flows around the back of the disk. This creates  turbulence and hence a lower pressure results. Because the  total pressure is affected by this reduced pressure, it creates  a drag. Newer aircraft are generally made with consideration  to this by fairing parts along the fuselage (teardrop) so that  turbulence and form drag is reduced.  

Total lift must overcome the total weight of the aircraft, which  is comprised of the actual weight and the tail-down force used  to control the aircraft’s pitch attitude. Thrust must overcome  total drag in order to provide forward speed with which to  produce lift. Understanding how the aircraft’s relationship  between these elements and the environment provide proper  interpretation of the aircraft’s instruments.  

# Newton’s First Law, the Law of Inertia  

Newton’s First Law of Motion is the Law of Inertia. It states  that a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion  will remain in motion, at the same speed and in the same  direction until affected by an outside force. The force with  which a body offers resistance to change is called the force of  inertia. Two outside forces are always present on an aircraft  in flight: gravity and drag. The pilot uses pitch and thrust  controls to counter or change these forces to maintain the  desired flightpath. If a pilot reduces power while in straight- and-level flight, the aircraft will slow due to drag. However,  as the aircraft slows there is a reduction of lift, which causes  the aircraft to begin a descent due to gravity.  [Figure 4-4]  

# Newton’s Second Law, the Law of Momentum  

Newton’s Second Law of Motion is the Law of Momentum,  which states that a body will accelerate in the same direction  as the force acting upon that body, and the acceleration  will be directly proportional to the net force and inversely  proportional to the mass of the body. Acceleration refers  either to an increase or decrease in velocity, although  deceleration is commonly used to indicate a decrease. This  law governs the aircraft’s ability to change flightpath and  speed, which are controlled by attitude (both pitch and bank)  and thrust inputs. Speeding up, slowing down, entering  climbs or descents, and turning are examples of accelerations  that the pilot controls in everyday flight.  [Figure 4-5]

Figure 4-5.   Newton’s Second Law of Motion: the Law of Momentum.  

# Newton’s Third Law, the Law of Reaction  

Newton’s Third Law of Motion is the Law of Reaction,  which states that for every action there is an equal and  opposite reaction. As shown in  Figure 4-6 , the action of  the jet engine’s thrust or the pull of the propeller lead to the  reaction of the aircraft’s forward motion. This law is also  responsible for a portion of the lift that is produced by a wing,  from the downward deflection of the airflow around it. This  downward force of the relative wind results in an equal but  opposite (upward) lifting force created by the airflow over  the wing.  [Figure 4-6]  

# Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is the envelope of air which surrounds the  Earth. A given volume of dry air contains about 78 percent  nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and about 1 percent other gases  such as argon, carbon dioxide, and others to a lesser degree.  

![](images/f6c4e9684015a1ac6d5605d581bf2a2a599e86f4f5cfca80724f959c65d9559d.jpg)

Figure 4-6.  Newton’s Third Law of Motion: the Law of Reaction.  

Although seemingly light, air does have weight and a one  square inch column of the atmosphere at sea level weighs  approximately 14.7 pounds. About one-half of the air by  weight is within the first 18,000 feet. The remainder of the  air is spread over a vertical distance in excess of 1,000 miles.  

Air density is a result of the relationship between temperature  and pressure. Air density is inversely related to temperature  and directly related to pressure. For a constant pressure to be  maintained as temperature increases, density must decrease,  and vice versa. For a constant temperature to be maintained  as pressure increases, density must increase, and vice versa.  These relationships provide a basis for understanding  instrument indications and aircraft performance.  

# Layers of the Atmosphere  

There are several layers to the atmosphere with the  troposphere being closest to the Earth’s surface extending to  about 60,000 feet at the equator. Following is the stratosphere,  mesosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, and finally the  exosphere. The tropopause is the thin layer between the  troposphere and the stratosphere. It varies in both thickness  and altitude but is generally defined where the standard  lapse (generally accepted at  $2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1,000 feet) decreases  significantly (usually down to  $1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or less).  

# International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)  

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  established the ICAO Standard Atmosphere as a way  of creating an international standard for reference and  performance computations. Instrument indications and  aircraft performance specifications are derived using this  standard as a reference. Because the standard atmosphere is  a derived set of conditions that rarely exist in reality, pilots  need to understand how deviations from the standard affect  both instrument indications and aircraft performance.  

In the standard atmosphere, sea level pressure is 29.92 inches  of mercury   $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$   and the temperature is  $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ). The  standard lapse rate for pressure is approximately a   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  decrease per 1,000 feet increase in altitude. The standard  lapse rate for temperature is a   $2\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(3.6~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ) decrease per  1,000 feet increase, up to the top of the stratosphere. Since  all aircraft performance is compared and evaluated in  the environment of the standard atmosphere, all aircraft  performance instrumentation is calibrated for the standard  atmosphere. Because the actual operating conditions rarely,  if ever, fit the standard atmosphere, certain corrections must  apply to the instrumentation and aircraft performance. For  instance, at 10,000 ISA predicts that the air pressure should be   $19.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}\left(29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}-10\:"\mathrm{Hg}=19.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}\right)$  ) and the outside  temperature at   $-5\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(15\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\mathrm{~-~}20\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  . If the temperature  or the pressure is different than the International Standard  Atmosphere (ISA) prediction an adjustment must be made to  performance predictions and various instrument indications.  

# Pressure Altitude  

Pressure altitude is the height above the standard datum  plane (SDP). The aircraft altimeter is essentially a sensitive  barometer calibrated to indicate altitude in the standard  atmosphere. If the altimeter is set for   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   SDP, the  altitude indicated is the pressure altitude-the altitude in the  standard atmosphere corresponding to the sensed pressure.  

The SDP is a theoretical level where the pressure of the  atmosphere is  $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   and the weight of air is 14.7 psi.  As atmospheric pressure changes, the SDP may be below,  at, or above sea level. Pressure altitude is important as a  basis for determining aircraft performance, as well as for  assigning flight levels to aircraft operating at or above 18,000  feet. The pressure altitude can be determined by either of  two methods: (1) by setting the barometric scale of the  altimeter to  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   and reading the indicated altitude, or  (2) by applying a correction factor to the indicated altitude  according to the reported altimeter setting.  

# Density Altitude  

Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard  temperature. As the density of the air increases (lower  density altitude), aircraft performance increases. Conversely,  as air density decreases (higher density altitude), aircraft  performance decreases. A decrease in air density means a  high density altitude; an increase in air density means a lower  density altitude. Density altitude is used in calculating aircraft  performance. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air at  each level in the atmosphere has a specific density; under  standard conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude  identify the same level. Density altitude, then, is the vertical  distance above sea level in the standard atmosphere at which  a given density is to be found. It can be computed using  a Koch Chart or a flight computer with a density altitude  function.  [Figure 4-7]  

![](images/6d3b34a9596895ccc9d2c19b6dddff71e3832be596aab928e24f203d077c2bc8.jpg)  
Figure 4-7.  Koch chart sample.  

If a chart is not available, the density altitude can be estimated  by adding 120 feet for every degree Celsius above the ISA. For  example, at 3,000 feet PA, the ISA prediction is  $9\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}-$  [lapse rate of  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1,000 feet   $\times\,3=6~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}]$  ). However, if the  actual temperature is   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $11~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   more than that predicted  by ISA) then the difference of   $11~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   is multiplied by 120 feet  equaling 1,320. Adding this figure to the original 3,000 feet  provides a density altitude of 4,320 feet (3,000 feet  $+1{,}320$   feet).  

# Lift  

Lift always acts in a direction perpendicular to the relative  wind and to the lateral axis of the aircraft. The fact that lift is  referenced to the wing, not to the Earth’s surface, is the source  of many errors in learning flight control. Lift is not always  “up.” Its direction relative to the Earth’s surface changes as  the pilot maneuvers the aircraft.  

The magnitude of the force of lift is directly proportional to  the density of the air, the area of the wings, and the airspeed.  It also depends upon the type of wing and the AOA. Lift  increases with an increase in AOA up to the stalling angle,  at which point it decreases with any further increase in AOA.  In conventional aircraft, lift is therefore controlled by varying  the AOA and speed.  

# Pitch/Power Relationship  

An examination of  Figure 4-8  illustrates the relationship  between pitch and power while controlling flightpath and  airspeed. In order to maintain a constant lift, as airspeed is  

![](images/ce906ce19cdef1919d396952bd699df00aa2cc8f5712aa22234c4d4f5989c005.jpg)  
Figure 4-8.  Relationship of lift to AOA.  

reduced, pitch must be increased. The pilot controls pitch  through the elevators, which control the AOA. When back  pressure is applied on the elevator control, the tail lowers  and the nose rises, thus increasing the wing’s AOA and lift.  Under most conditions the elevator is placing downward  pressure on the tail. This pressure requires energy that is  taken from aircraft performance (speed). Therefore, when  the CG is closer to the aft portion of the aircraft the elevator  downward forces are less. This results in less energy used for  downward forces, in turn resulting in more energy applied  to aircraft performance.  

Thrust is controlled by using the throttle to establish or  maintain desired airspeeds. The most precise method  of controlling flightpath is to use pitch control while  simultaneously using power (thrust) to control airspeed. In  order to maintain a constant lift, a change in pitch requires a  change in power, and vice versa.  

If the pilot wants the aircraft to accelerate while maintaining  altitude, thrust must be increased to overcome drag. As  the aircraft speeds up, lift is increased. To prevent gaining  altitude, the pitch angle must be lowered to reduce the AOA  and maintain altitude. To decelerate while maintaining  altitude, thrust must be decreased to less than the value of  drag. As the aircraft slows down, lift is reduced. To prevent  losing altitude, the pitch angle must be increased in order to  increase the AOA and maintain altitude.  

# Drag Curves  

When induced drag and parasite drag are plotted on a graph,  the total drag on the aircraft appears in the form of a “drag  curve.” Graph A of  Figure 4-9  shows a curve based on thrust  versus drag, which is primarily used for jet aircraft. Graph B  

![](images/812f32cef3452a2bebb7c1d8fd18e485f25c7cbf60723cc40f90d2dca6238ea9.jpg)  
Figure 4-9.  Thrust and power required curves.  

of  Figure 4-9  is based on power versus drag, and it is used  for propeller-driven aircraft. This chapter focuses on power  versus drag charts for propeller-driven aircraft.  

Understanding the drag curve can provide valuable insight  into the various performance parameters and limitations of  the aircraft. Because power must equal drag to maintain a  steady airspeed, the curve can be either a drag curve or a  power required curve. The power required curve represents  the amount of power needed to overcome drag in order to  maintain a steady speed in level flight.  

The propellers used on most reciprocating engines achieve  peak propeller efficiencies in the range of 80 to 88 percent.  As airspeed increases, the propeller efficiency increases until  it reaches its maximum. Any airspeed above this maximum  point causes a reduction in propeller efficiency. An engine  that produces 160 horsepower will have only about 80  percent of that power converted into available horsepower,  approximately 128 horsepower. The remainder is lost energy.  This is the reason the thrust and power available curves  change with speed.  

# Regions of Command  

The drag curve also illustrates the two regions of command:  the region of normal command, and the region of reversed  command. The term “region of command” refers to the  relationship between speed and the power required to  maintain or change that speed. “Command” refers to the input  the pilot must give in terms of power or thrust to maintain a  new speed once reached.  

The “region of normal command” occurs where power must  be added to increase speed. This region exists at speeds higher  than the minimum drag point primarily as a result of parasite  drag. The “region of reversed command” occurs where  additional power is needed to maintain a slower airspeed. This  region exists at speeds slower than the minimum drag point   $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX}}$   on the thrust required curve,  Figure 4-9 ) and is  primarily due to induced drag.  Figure 4-10  shows how one  power setting can yield two speeds, points 1 and 2. This is  because at point 1 there is high induced drag and low parasite  drag, while at point 2 there is high parasite drag and low  induced drag.  

![](images/841f222d2410c4dd3f6c0ceb33bbc2672799d3e2824e7d92c1891bbcaa186666.jpg)  
Figure 4-10.  Regions of command.  

# Control Characteristics  

Most flying is conducted in the region of normal command:  for example, cruise, climb, and maneuvers. The region of  reversed command may be encountered in the slow-speed  phases of flight during takeoff and landing; however, for  most general aviation aircraft, this region is very small and  is below normal approach speeds.  

Flight in the region of normal command is characterized  by a relatively strong tendency of the aircraft to maintain  the trim speed. Flight in the region of reversed command is  characterized by a relatively weak tendency of the aircraft to  maintain the trim speed. In fact, it is likely the aircraft exhibits  no inherent tendency to maintain the trim speed in this area.  For this reason, the pilot must give particular attention to  precise control of airspeed when operating in the slow-speed  phases of the region of reversed command.  

Operation in the region of reversed command does not imply  that great control difficulty and dangerous conditions exist.  However, it does amplify errors of basic flying technique— making proper flying technique and precise control of the  aircraft very important.  

# Speed Stability Normal Command  

The characteristics of flight in the region of normal command  are illustrated at point A on the curve in  Figure 4-11 . If  the aircraft is established in steady, level flight at point A,  lift is equal to weight, and the power available is set equal  to the power required. If the airspeed is increased with no  changes to the power setting, a power deficiency exists.  The aircraft has a natural tendency to return to the initial  speed to balance power and drag. If the airspeed is reduced  with no changes to the power setting, an excess of power  exists. The aircraft has a natural tendency to speed up to  regain the balance between power and drag. Keeping the  aircraft in proper trim enhances this natural tendency. The  static longitudinal stability of the aircraft tends to return the  aircraft to the original trimmed condition.  

![](images/f2862b005589e59739a95400510e1f9dfc9ff638ad42a05be66857db559bcaa2.jpg)  
Figure 4-11.  Region of speed stability.  

An aircraft flying in steady, level flight at point C is in  equilibrium.  [Figure 4-11]  If the speed were increased  or decreased slightly, the aircraft would tend to remain at  that speed. This is because the curve is relatively flat and  a slight change in speed does not produce any significant  excess or deficiency in power. It has the characteristic of  neutral stability (i.e., the aircraft’s tendency is to remain at  the new speed).  

# Reversed Command  

The characteristics of flight in the region of reversed command  are illustrated at point B on the curve in  Figure 4-10 . If the  aircraft is established in steady, level flight at point B, lift is  equal to weight, and the power available is set equal to the  power required. When the airspeed is increased greater than  point B, an excess of power exists. This causes the aircraft  to accelerate to an even higher speed. When the aircraft is  slowed to some airspeed lower than point B, a deficiency  of power exists. The natural tendency of the aircraft is to  continue to slow to an even lower airspeed.  

This tendency toward instability happens because the  variation of excess power to either side of point B magnifies  the original change in speed. Although the static longitudinal  stability of the aircraft tries to maintain the original trimmed  condition, this instability is more of an influence because of  the increased induced drag due to the higher AOA in slow- speed flight.  

# Trim  

The term trim refers to employing adjustable aerodynamic  devices on the aircraft to adjust forces so the pilot does not  have to manually hold pressure on the controls. One means is  to employ trim tabs. A trim tab is a small, adjustable hinged  surface, located on the trailing edge of the elevator, aileron,  or rudder control surfaces. (Some aircraft use adjustable  stabilizers instead of trim tabs for pitch trim.) Trimming is  accomplished by deflecting the tab in the direction opposite  to that in which the primary control surface must be held.  The force of the airflow striking the tab causes the main  control surface to be deflected to a position that corrects the  unbalanced condition of the aircraft.  

Because the trim tabs use airflow to function, trim is a function  of speed. Any change in speed results in the need to re-trim the  aircraft. An aircraft properly trimmed in pitch seeks to return  to the original speed before the change. It is very important  for instrument pilots to keep the aircraft in constant trim. This  reduces the pilot’s workload significantly, allowing attention  to other duties without compromising aircraft control.  

# Slow-Speed Flight  

Anytime an aircraft is flying near the stalling speed or the  region of reversed command, such as in final approach for a  normal landing, the initial part of a go around, or maneuvering  in slow flight, it is operating in what is called slow-speed flight.  If the aircraft weighs 4,000 pounds, the lift produced by the  aircraft must be 4,000 pounds. When lift is less than 4,000  pounds, the aircraft is no longer able to sustain level flight, and  consequently descends. During intentional descents, this is an  important factor and is used in the total control of the aircraft.  

However, because lift is required during low speed flight  and is characterized by high AOA, flaps or other high lift  devices are needed to either change the camber of the airfoil,  or delay the boundary level separation. Plain and split flaps  [Figure 4-12]  are most commonly used to change the camber  of an airfoil. It should be noted that with the application of  flaps, the aircraft will stall at a lower AOA. For example,  if the basic wing stalls at   $18^{\circ}$   without flaps, then with the  addition of flaps to the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$   position, the new AOA that  the wing will stall is   $15^{\circ}$  . However, the value of lift (flaps  extended to the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$   position) produces more lift than lift  at   $18^{\circ}$   on the basic wing.  

![](images/cbf87070115076452a8e1bcc730e3310b93e55591a1b345fd1128e2249cc560e.jpg)  
Figure 4-12.  Plain and split flaps.  

Delaying the boundary layer separation is another way to  increase  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  . Several methods are employed (such as  suction and use of a blowing boundary layer control), but the  most common device used on general aviation light aircraft  is the vortex generator. Small strips of metal placed along  the wing (usually in front of the control surfaces) create  turbulence. The turbulence in turn mixes high energy air from  outside the boundary layer with boundary layer air. The effect  is similar to other boundary layer devices.  [Figure 4-13]  

# Small Airplanes  

Most small airplanes maintain a speed well in excess of 1.3  Slotted  times   $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$   on an instrument approach. An airplane with a  stall speed of 50 knots   $(\mathrm{V_{SO}})$   has a normal approach speed  of 65 knots. However, this same airplane may maintain 90  knots   $(1.8\;\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SO}})$  ) while on the final segment of an instrument  approach. The landing gear will most likely be extended at  the beginning of the descent to the minimum descent altitude,  or upon intercepting the glideslope of the instrument landing  system. The pilot may also select an intermediate flap setting  for this phase of the approach. The airplane at this speed has  good positive speed stability, as represented by point A on  Figure 4-11 . Flying in this regime permits the pilot to make  slight pitch changes without changing power settings, and  

![](images/ff0d11aeea723b41427ec33a38c089bcb88d8c8d10dbd4df07ba44ed7b8f3854.jpg)  
Figure 4-13.  Vortex generators.  

accept minor speed changes knowing that when the pitch is  returned to the initial setting, the speed returns to the original  setting. This reduces the pilot’s workload.  

Aircraft are usually slowed to a normal landing speed when  on the final approach just prior to landing. When slowed to  65 knots,   $(1.3\,\,\mathrm{V_{SO}})$  ), the airplane will be close to point C.  [Figure 4-14]  At this point, precise control of the pitch and  power becomes more crucial for maintaining the correct speed.  Pitch and power coordination is necessary because the speed  stability is relatively neutral since the speed tends to remain  at the new value and not return to the original setting. In  addition to the need for more precise airspeed control, the pilot  normally changes the aircraft’s configuration by extending  landing flaps. This configuration change means the pilot must  be alert to unwanted pitch changes at a low altitude.  

![](images/1d3ed488aba89a0f992cc1403a163402c5fc90dc892a04ebb92d7707d0cd2f26.jpg)  
Figure 4-14.  Forces in a turn.  

If allowed to slow several knots, the airplane could enter  the region of reversed command. At this point, the airplane  could develop an unsafe sink rate and continue to lose speed  unless the pilot takes a prompt corrective action. Proper pitch  and power coordination is critical in this region due to speed  instability and the tendency of increased divergence from  the desired speed.  

# Large Airplanes  

Pilots of larger airplanes with higher stall speeds may find the  speed they maintain on the instrument approach is near 1.3   $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  , putting them near point C  [Figure 4-11]  the entire time  the airplane is on the final approach segment. In this case,  precise speed control is necessary throughout the approach. It  may be necessary to temporarily select excessive, or deficient  thrust in relation to the target thrust setting in order to quickly  correct for airspeed deviations.  

For example, a pilot is on an instrument approach at 1.3   $\mathrm{V_{SO}}.$  , a speed near  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , and knows that a certain power  setting maintains that speed. The airplane slows several knots  below the desired speed because of a slight reduction in the  power setting. The pilot increases the power slightly, and the  airplane begins to accelerate, but at a slow rate. Because the  airplane is still in the “flat part” of the drag curve, this slight  increase in power will not cause a rapid return to the desired  speed. The pilot may need to increase the power higher  than normally needed to maintain the new speed, allow the  airplane to accelerate, then reduce the power to the setting  that maintains the desired speed.  

# Climbs  

Excess power is the available power over and above that  required to maintain horizontal flight at a given speed.  Although the terms power and thrust are sometimes  used interchangeably (erroneously implying they are  synonymous), distinguishing between the two is important  when considering climb performance. Work is the product of  a force moving through a distance and is usually independent  of time. Power implies work rate or units of work per unit  of time, and as such is a function of the speed at which the  force is developed. Thrust, also a function of work, means  the force which imparts a change in the velocity of a mass.  

During takeoff, the aircraft does not stall even though it  may be in a climb near the stall speed. The reason is that  excess power (used to produce thrust) is used during this  flight regime. Therefore, it is important if an engine fails  after takeoff, to compensate the loss of thrust with pitch  and airspeed.  

For a given weight of the aircraft, the angle of climb depends  on the difference between thrust and drag, or the excess  thrust. When the excess thrust is zero, the inclination of the  flightpath is zero, and the aircraft is in steady, level flight.  When thrust is greater than drag, the excess thrust allows a  climb angle depending on the amount of excess thrust. When  thrust is less than drag, the deficiency of thrust induces an  angle of descent.  

# Acceleration in Cruise Flight  

Aircraft accelerate in level flight because of an excess of  power over what is required to maintain a steady speed. This  is the same excess power used to climb. Upon reaching the  desired altitude with pitch being lowered to maintain that  altitude, the excess power now accelerates the aircraft to its  cruise speed. However, reducing power too soon after level  off results in a longer period of time to accelerate.  

# Turns  

Like any moving object, an aircraft requires a sideward force  to make it turn. In a normal turn, this force is supplied by  banking the aircraft in order to exert lift inward, as well as  upward. The force of lift is separated into two components  at right angles to each other.  [Figure 4-14]  The upward  acting lift together with the opposing weight becomes the  vertical lift component. The horizontally acting lift and its  opposing centrifugal force are the horizontal lift component,  or centripetal force. This horizontal lift component is the  sideward force that causes an aircraft to turn. The equal and  opposite reaction to this sideward force is centrifugal force,  which is merely an apparent force as a result of inertia.  

The ability for an aircraft to climb depends upon an excess  power or thrust over what it takes to maintain equilibrium.  

The relationship between the aircraft’s speed and bank angle  to the rate and radius of turns is important for instrument  pilots to understand. The pilot can use this knowledge to  properly estimate bank angles needed for certain rates of turn,  or to determine how much to lead when intercepting a course.  

# Rate of Turn  

The rate of turn, normally measured in degrees per second,  is based upon a set bank angle at a set speed. If either one  of these elements changes, the rate of turn changes. If the  aircraft increases its speed without changing the bank angle,  the rate of turn decreases. Likewise, if the speed decreases  without changing the bank angle, the rate of turn increases.  

Changing the bank angle without changing speed also causes  the rate of turn to change. Increasing the bank angle without  changing speed increases the rate of turn, while decreasing  the bank angle reduces the rate of turn.  

The standard rate of turn,  $3^{\circ}$   per second, is used as the main  reference for bank angle. Therefore, the pilot must understand  how the angle of bank varies with speed changes, such  as slowing down for holding or an instrument approach.  Figure 4-15  shows the turn relationship with reference to a  constant bank angle or a constant airspeed, and the effects on  rate of turn and radius of turn. A rule of thumb for determining  the standard rate turn is to divide the airspeed by ten and  add 7. An aircraft with an airspeed of 90 knots takes a bank  angle of   $16^{\circ}$   to maintain a standard rate turn (90 divided by  10 plus 7 equals   $16^{\circ}$  ).  

# Radius of Turn  

The radius of turn varies with changes in either speed or  bank. If the speed is increased without changing the bank  angle, the radius of turn increases, and vice versa. If the speed  is constant, increasing the bank angle reduces the radius of  turn, while decreasing the bank angle increases the radius of  turn. This means that intercepting a course at a higher speed  requires more distance, and therefore, requires a longer lead.  If the speed is slowed considerably in preparation for holding  or an approach, a shorter lead is needed than that required for  cruise flight.  

# Coordination of Rudder and Aileron Controls  

Any time ailerons are used, adverse yaw is produced. Adverse  yaw is caused when the ailerons are deflected as a roll motion  (as in turn) is initiated. In a right turn, the right aileron is  deflected upward while the left is deflected downward. Lift is  increased on the left side and reduced on the right, resulting  in a bank to the right. However, as a result of producing lift  on the left, induced drag is also increased on the left side.  The drag causes the left wing to slow down, in turn causing  the nose of the aircraft to initially move (left) in the direction  opposite of the turn. Correcting for this yaw with rudder, when  entering and exiting turns, is necessary for precise control of  the airplane when flying on instruments. The pilot can tell if  the turn is coordinated by checking the ball in the turn-and- slip indicator or the turn coordinator.  [Figure 4-16]  

As the aircraft banks to enter a turn, a portion of the wing’s  vertical lift becomes the horizontal component; therefore,  without an increase in back pressure, the aircraft loses altitude  during the turn. The loss of vertical lift can be offset by  increasing the pitch in one-half bar width increments. Trim  may be used to relieve the control pressures; however, if used,  it has to be removed once the turn is complete.  

In a slipping turn, the aircraft is not turning at the rate  appropriate to the bank being used, and the aircraft falls to  the inside of the turn. The aircraft is banked too much for the  rate of turn, so the horizontal lift component is greater than  the centrifugal force. A skidding turn results from excess of  

![](images/0b31210ad8cace3c23a0a18690398bcadbc5904889306ff3360c043add9a6153.jpg)

Note the slight differences in rudder placement.  

centrifugal force over the horizontal lift component, pulling  the aircraft toward the outside of the turn. The rate of turn  is too great for the angle of bank, so the horizontal lift  component is less than the centrifugal force.  

An inclinometer, located in the turn coordinator, or turn and  bank indicator indicates the quality of the turn, and should  be centered when the wings are banked. If the ball is off of  center on the side toward the turn, the aircraft is slipping and  rudder pressure should be added on that side to increase the  rate of turn or the bank angle should be reduced. If the ball  is off of center on the side away from the turn, the aircraft  is skidding and rudder pressure toward the turn should be  relaxed or the bank angle should be increased. If the aircraft  is properly rigged, the ball should be in the center when the  wings are level; use rudder and/or aileron trim if available.  

The increase in induced drag (caused by the increase in  AOA necessary to maintain altitude) results in a minor loss  of airspeed if the power setting is not changed.  

# Load Factor  

Any force applied to an aircraft to deflect its flight from a  straight line produces a stress on its structure; the amount of  this force is termed load factor. A load factor is the ratio of  the aerodynamic force on the aircraft to the gross weight of  the aircraft (e.g., lift/weight). For example, a load factor of 3  means the total load on an aircraft’s structure is three times  its gross weight. When designing an aircraft, it is necessary  to determine the highest load factors that can be expected in  normal operation under various operational situations. These  “highest” load factors are called “limit load factors.”  

Aircraft are placed in various categories (i.e., normal, utility,  and acrobatic) depending upon the load factors they are  designed to take. For reasons of safety, the aircraft must be  designed to withstand certain maximum load factors without  any structural damage.  

The specified load may be expected in terms of aerodynamic  forces, as in turns. In level flight in undisturbed air, the  wings are supporting not only the weight of the aircraft, but  centrifugal force as well. As the bank steepens, the horizontal  lift component increases, centrifugal force increases, and the  load factor increases. If the load factor becomes so great that  an increase in AOA cannot provide enough lift to support  the load, the wing stalls. Since the stalling speed increases  directly with the square root of the load factor, the pilot  should be aware of the flight conditions during which the  load factor can become critical. Steep turns at slow airspeed,  structural ice accumulation, and vertical gusts in turbulent  air can increase the load factor to a critical level.  

# Icing  

One of the greatest hazards to flight is aircraft icing. The  instrument pilot must be aware of the conditions conducive to  aircraft icing. These conditions include the types of icing, the  effects of icing on aircraft control and performance, effects  of icing on aircraft systems, and the use and limitations of  aircraft deice and anti-ice equipment. Coping with the hazards  of icing begins with preflight planning to determine where  icing may occur during a flight and ensuring the aircraft is  free of ice and frost prior to takeoff. This attention to detail  extends to managing deice and anti-ice systems properly  during the flight, because weather conditions may change  rapidly, and the pilot must be able to recognize when a change  of flight plan is required.  

# Types of Icing  

# Structural Icing  

Structural icing refers to the accumulation of ice on the  exterior of the aircraft. Ice forms on aircraft structures and  surfaces when super-cooled droplets impinge on them and  freeze. Small and/or narrow objects are the best collectors  of droplets and ice up most rapidly. This is why a small  protuberance within sight of the pilot can be used as an “ice  evidence probe.” It is generally one of the first parts of the  airplane on which an appreciable amount of ice forms. An  aircraft’s tailplane is a better collector than its wings, because  the tailplane presents a thinner surface to the airstream.  

# Induction Icing  

Ice in the induction system can reduce the amount of air  available for combustion. The most common example of  reciprocating engine induction icing is carburetor ice. Most  pilots are familiar with this phenomenon, which occurs when  moist air passes through a carburetor venturi and is cooled. As  a result of this process, ice may form on the venturi walls and  throttle plate, restricting airflow to the engine. This may occur  at temperatures between   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $(-7\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   and   $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $(21\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  .  The problem is remedied by applying carburetor heat, which  uses the engine’s own exhaust as a heat source to melt the  ice or prevent its formation. On the other hand, fuel-injected  aircraft engines usually are less vulnerable to icing but still  can be affected if the engine’s air source becomes blocked  with ice. Manufacturers provide an alternate air source that  may be selected in case the normal system malfunctions.  

In turbojet aircraft, air that is drawn into the engines creates  an area of reduced pressure at the inlet, which lowers the  temperature below that of the surrounding air. In marginal  icing conditions (i.e., conditions where icing is possible),  this reduction in temperature may be sufficient to cause ice  to form on the engine inlet, disrupting the airflow into the  engine. Another hazard occurs when ice breaks off and is  ingested into a running engine, which can cause damage to  fan blades, engine compressor stall, or combustor flameout.  When anti-icing systems are used, runback water also can  refreeze on unprotected surfaces of the inlet and, if excessive,  reduce airflow into the engine or distort the airflow pattern in  such a manner as to cause compressor or fan blades to vibrate,  possibly damaging the engine. Another problem in turbine  engines is the icing of engine probes used to set power levels 

 (for example, engine inlet temperature or engine pressure ratio 

 (EPR) probes), which can lead to erroneous readings of engine  instrumentation operational difficulties or total power loss.  

The type of ice that forms can be classified as clear, rime, or  mixed, based on the structure and appearance of the ice. The  type of ice that forms varies depending on the atmospheric  and flight conditions in which it forms. Significant structural  icing on an aircraft can cause serious aircraft control and  performance problems.  

# Clear Ice  

A glossy, transparent ice formed by the relatively slow  freezing of super cooled water is referred to as clear ice.  [Figure 4-17]  The terms “clear” and “glaze” have been used  

![](images/558d6b6f5bab5f77f5df04ddecb608e52a3c80940cd494714d19317c7c453877.jpg)  

for essentially the same type of ice accretion. This type of  ice is denser, harder, and sometimes more transparent than  rime ice. With larger accretions, clear ice may form “horns.”  [Figure 4-18]  Temperatures close to the freezing point, large  amounts of liquid water, high aircraft velocities, and large  droplets are conducive to the formation of clear ice.  

![](images/7636373c140feff62bdf55f7f2e6b5c827a791c488052e3e6177642cd653b1f5.jpg)  
Figure 4-18.  

# Rime Ice  

A rough, milky, opaque ice formed by the instantaneous or  very rapid freezing of super cooled droplets as they strike  the aircraft is known as rime ice.  [Figure 4-19]  The rapid  freezing results in the formation of air pockets in the ice,  giving it an opaque appearance and making it porous and  brittle. For larger accretions, rime ice may form a streamlined  extension of the wing. Low temperatures, lesser amounts of  liquid water, low velocities, and small droplets are conducive  to the formation of rime ice.  

![](images/96cad09cc850b73edcefbc918d986a09b8338b6bb1968162ad6ce74c722fd15b.jpg)  
Figure 4-19.  Rime ice.  

# Mixed Ice  

Mixed ice is a combination of clear and rime ice formed on  the same surface. It is the shape and roughness of the ice  that is most important from an aerodynamic point of view.  

# General Effects of Icing on Airfoils  

The most hazardous aspect of structural icing is its aerodynamic  effects.  [Figure 4-20]  Ice alters the shape of an airfoil, reducing  the maximum coefficient of lift and AOA at which the aircraft  stalls. Note that at very low AOAs, there may be little or no  effect of the ice on the coefficient of lift. Therefore, when  cruising at a low AOA, ice on the wing may have little effect  on the lift. However, note that the ice significantly reduces  the  $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$  , and the AOA at which it occurs (the stall angle)  is much lower. Thus, when slowing down and increasing the  AOA for approach, the pilot may find that ice on the wing,  which had little effect on lift in cruise now, causes stall to  

![](images/0075ff0386b2878950daeb58413f582b8389279527b28f6b6e6dd2fa80ae52d1.jpg)  
Figure 4-20.  Aerodynamic effects of icing.  

occur at a lower AOA and higher speed. Even a thin layer of  ice at the leading edge of a wing, especially if it is rough, can  have a significant effect in increasing stall speed. For large  ice shapes, especially those with horns, the lift may also be  reduced at a lower AOA. The accumulation of ice affects the  coefficient of drag of the airfoil.  [Figure 4-20]  Note that the  effect is significant even at very small AOAs.  

A significant reduction in   $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$   and a reduction in the  AOA where stall occurs can result from a relatively small  ice accretion. A reduction of   $\mathrm{C_{L-MAX}}$   by 30 percent is not  unusual, and a large horn ice accretion can result in reductions  of 40 percent to 50 percent. Drag tends to increase steadily  as ice accretes. An airfoil drag increase of 100 percent is not  unusual, and for large horn ice accretions, the increase can  be 200 percent or even higher.  

Ice on an airfoil can have other effects not depicted in these  curves. Even before airfoil stall, there can be changes in the  pressure over the airfoil that may affect a control surface at  the trailing edge. Furthermore, on takeoff, approach, and  landing, the wings of many aircraft are multi-element airfoils  with three or more elements. Ice may affect the different  elements in different ways. Ice may also affect the way in  which the air streams interact over the elements.  

Ice can partially block or limit control surfaces, which  limits or makes control movements ineffective. Also, if the  extra weight caused by ice accumulation is too great, the  aircraft may not be able to become airborne and, if in flight,  the aircraft may not be able to maintain altitude. Therefore  any accumulation of ice or frost should be removed before  attempting flight.  

Another hazard of structural icing is the possible uncommanded  and uncontrolled roll phenomenon, referred to as roll upset,  associated with severe inflight icing. Pilots flying aircraft  certificated for flight in known icing conditions should be  aware that severe icing is a condition outside of the aircraft’s  certification icing envelope. Roll upset may be caused by  airflow separation (aerodynamic stall), which induces self- deflection of the ailerons and loss of or degraded roll handling  characteristics  [Figure 4-21] . These phenomena can result  from severe icing conditions without the usual symptoms of  ice accumulation or a perceived aerodynamic stall.  

Most aircraft have a nose-down pitching moment from the  wings because the CG is ahead of the CP. It is the role of the  tailplane to counteract this moment by providing a downward  force.  [Figure  $_{4-22J}$    The result of this configuration is that  actions which move the wing away from stall, such as  

![](images/8ad6326d9465439e30171d1c2b4d6ac2a07e0832668c3f90a6ee733952c62518.jpg)

deployment of flaps or increasing speed, may increase the  negative AOA of the tail. With ice on the tailplane, it may  stall after full or partial deployment of flaps.  [Figure 4-23]  

Since the tailplane is ordinarily thinner than the wing, it is a  more efficient collector of ice. On most aircraft the tailplane  is not visible to the pilot, who therefore cannot observe how  well it has been cleared of ice by any deicing system. Thus, it  is important that the pilot be alert to the possibility of tailplane  stall, particularly on approach and landing.

Figure 4-23.  Ice on the tailplane.  

# Piper PA-34-200T (Des Moines, Iowa)  

The pilot of this flight, which took place on January 9,  1996, said that upon crossing the runway threshold and  lowering the flaps   $25^{\circ}$  , “the airplane pitched down.” The  pilot “immediately released the flaps and added power, but  the airplane was basically uncontrollable at this point.” The  pilot reduced power and lowered the flaps before striking  the runway on its centerline and sliding 1,000 feet before  coming to a stop. The accident resulted in serious injury to  the pilot, the sole occupant.  

Examination of the wreckage revealed heavy impact  damage to the airplane’s forward fuselage, engines, and  wings. Approximately one-half inch of rime ice was  observed adhering to the leading edges of the left and right  horizontal stabilizers and along the leading edge of the  vertical stabilizer.  

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  determined the probable cause of the accident was the pilot’s  failure to use the airplane’s deicing system, which resulted  in an accumulation of empennage ice and a tailplane stall.  Factors relating to this accident were the icing conditions  and the pilot’s intentional flight into those known conditions.  

# Tailplane Stall Symptoms  

Any of the following symptoms, occurring singly or in  combination, may be a warning of tailplane icing:  

•	 Elevator control pulsing, oscillations, or vibrations; •	 Abnormal nose-down trim change; •	 Any other unusual or abnormal pitch anomalies  (possibly resulting in pilot induced oscillations); •	 Reduction or loss of elevator effectiveness; •	 Sudden change in elevator force (control would move  nose-down if unrestrained); and •	 Sudden uncommanded nose-down pitch.  

If any of the above symptoms occur, the pilot should:  

•	 Immediately retract the flaps to the previous setting  and apply appropriate nose-up elevator pressure; •	 Increase airspeed appropriately for the reduced flap  extension setting; •	 Apply sufficient power for aircraft configuration  and conditions. (High engine power settings may  adversely impact response to tailplane stall conditions  at high airspeed in some aircraft designs. Observe the  manufacturer’s recommendations regarding power  settings.); •	 Make nose-down pitch changes slowly, even in  gusting conditions, if circumstances allow; and •	 If a pneumatic deicing system is used, operate the  system several times in an attempt to clear the tailplane  of ice.  

Once a tailplane stall is encountered, the stall condition  tends to worsen with increased airspeed and possibly may  worsen with increased power settings at the same flap  setting. Airspeed, at any flap setting, in excess of the airplane  manufacturer’s recommendations, accompanied by uncleared  ice contaminating the tailplane, may result in a tailplane stall  and uncommanded pitch down from which recovery may not  be possible. A tailplane stall may occur at speeds less than  the maximum flap extended speed   $(\mathrm{V_{FE}})$  .  

# Propeller Icing  

Ice buildup on propeller blades reduces thrust for the same  aerodynamic reasons that wings tend to lose lift and increase  drag when ice accumulates on them. The greatest quantity  of ice normally collects on the spinner and inner radius of  the propeller. Propeller areas on which ice may accumulate  and be ingested into the engine normally are anti-iced rather  than deiced to reduce the probability of ice being shed into  the engine.  

# Effects of Icing on Critical Aircraft Systems  

In addition to the hazards of structural and induction icing,  the pilot must be aware of other aircraft systems susceptible  to icing. The effects of icing do not produce the performance  loss of structural icing or the power loss of induction icing  but can present serious problems to the instrument pilot.  Examples of such systems are flight instruments, stall  warning systems, and windshields.  

# Flight Instruments  

Various aircraft instruments including the airspeed indicator,  altimeter, and rate-of-climb indicator utilize pressures  sensed by pitot tubes and static ports for normal operation.  

When covered by ice these instruments display incorrect  information thereby presenting serious hazard to instrument  flight. Detailed information on the operation of these  instruments and the specific effects of icing is presented in  Chapter 5, Flight Instruments.  

# Stall Warning Systems  

Stall warning systems provide essential information to pilots.  These systems range from a sophisticated stall warning vane  to a simple stall warning switch. Icing affects these systems  in several ways resulting in possible loss of stall warning to  the pilot. The loss of these systems can exacerbate an already  hazardous situation. Even when an aircraft’s stall warning  system remains operational during icing conditions, it may  be ineffective because the wing stalls at a lower AOA due  to ice on the airfoil.  

# Windshields  

Accumulation of ice on flight deck windows can severely  restrict the pilot’s visibility outside of the aircraft. Aircraft  equipped for flight into known icing conditions typically have  some form of windshield anti-icing to enable the pilot to see  outside the aircraft in case icing is encountered in flight. One  system consists of an electrically heated plate installed onto  the airplane’s windshield to give the pilot a narrow band of  clear visibility. Another system uses a bar at the lower end  of the windshield to spray deicing fluid onto it and prevent  ice from forming. On high performance aircraft that require  complex windshields to protect against bird strikes and  withstand pressurization loads, the heating element often is  a layer of conductive film or thin wire strands through which  electric current is run to heat the windshield and prevent ice  from forming.  

The pilot of an aircraft, which is not certificated or equipped  for flight in icing conditions, should avoid all icing conditions.  The aforementioned guides provide direction on how to do  this, and on how to exit icing conditions promptly and safely  should they be inadvertently encountered.  

The pilot of an aircraft, which is certificated for flight in  icing conditions can safely operate in the conditions for  which the aircraft was evaluated during the certification  process but should never become complacent about icing.  Even short encounters with small amounts of rough icing  can be very hazardous. The pilot should be familiar with all  information in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or Pilot’s  Operating Handbook (POH) concerning flight in icing  conditions and follow it carefully. Of particular importance  are proper operation of ice protection systems and any  airspeed minimums to be observed during or after flight  in icing conditions. There are some icing conditions for  which no aircraft is evaluated in the certification process,  such as super-cooled large drops (SLD). These subfreezing  water droplets, with diameters greater than 50 microns,  occur within or below clouds and sustained flight in these  conditions can be very hazardous. The pilot should be familiar  with any information in the AFM or POH relating to these  conditions, including aircraft-specific cues for recognizing  these hazardous conditions within clouds.  

The information in this chapter is an overview of the hazards  of aircraft icing. For more detailed information refer to  AC 91-74, Pilot Guide: Flight in Icing Conditions, AC 91- 51, Effect of Icing on Aircraft Control and Airplane Deice  and Anti-Ice Systems, AC 20-73, Aircraft Ice Protection  and AC 23.143-1, Ice Contaminated Tailplane Stall (ICTS).  

# Antenna Icing  

Because of their small size and shape, antennas that do not lay  flush with the aircraft’s skin tend to accumulate ice rapidly.  Furthermore, they often are devoid of internal anti-icing  or deicing capability for protection. During flight in icing  conditions, ice accumulations on an antenna may cause it to  begin to vibrate or cause radio signals to become distorted  and it may cause damage to the antenna. If a frozen antenna  breaks off, it can damage other areas of the aircraft in addition  to causing a communication or navigation system failure.  

# Summary  

Ice-contaminated aircraft have been involved in many  accidents. Takeoff accidents have usually been due to failure  to deice or anti-ice critical surfaces properly on the ground.  Proper deicing and anti-icing procedures are addressed in  two other pilot guides, Advisory Circular (AC) 120-58, Pilot  Guide: Large Aircraft Ground Deicing and AC 135-17, Pilot  Guide: Small Aircraft Ground Deicing.  

# Chapter 5 Flight Instruments  

# Introduction  

Aircraft became a practical means of transportation when  accurate flight instruments freed the pilot from the necessity  of maintaining visual contact with the ground. Flight  instruments are crucial to conducting safe flight operations  and it is important that the pilot have a basic understanding  of their operation. The basic flight instruments required  for operation under visual flight rules (VFR) are airspeed  indicator (ASI), altimeter, and magnetic direction indicator.  In addition to these, operation under instrument flight rules  (IFR) requires a gyroscopic rate-of-turn indicator, slip-skid  indicator, sensitive altimeter adjustable for barometric  pressure, clock displaying hours, minutes, and seconds with  a sweep-second pointer or digital presentation, gyroscopic  pitch-and-bank indicator (artificial horizon), and gyroscopic  direction indicator (directional gyro or equivalent).  

Aircraft that are flown in instrument meteorological  conditions (IMC) are equipped with instruments that provide  attitude and direction reference, as well as navigation  instruments that allow precision flight from takeoff to landing  with limited or no outside visual reference.  

The instruments discussed in this chapter are those required  by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 91, and are organized into three groups: pitot-static  instruments, compass systems, and gyroscopic instruments.  The chapter concludes with a discussion of how to preflight  these systems for IFR flight. This chapter addresses additional  avionics systems such as Electronic Flight Information  Systems (EFIS), Ground Proximity Warning System  (GPWS), Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS),  Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS),  Head Up Display (HUD), etc., that are increasingly being  incorporated into general aviation aircraft.  

# Pitot/Static Systems  

Pitot pressure, or impact air pressure, is sensed through an  open-end tube pointed directly into the relative wind flowing  around the aircraft. The pitot tube connects to the ASI or an  air data computer depending on your aircraft's configuration.  

# Static Pressure  

Static pressure is also used by the ASI as well as the other  pitot static instruments for determining altitude and vertical  speed. Static pressure may be sensed at one or more locations  on an aircraft. Some may be flush mounted on the fuselage or  integrated into the electrically heated pitot tube.  [Figure 5-1] These ports are in locations proven by flight tests to be in  undisturbed air, and they may be paired, one on either side of  the aircraft. This dual location prevents lateral movement of  the aircraft from giving erroneous static pressure indications.  The areas around the static ports may be heated with electric  heater elements to prevent ice forming over the port and  blocking the entry of the static air.  

Three basic pressure-operated instruments are found in  aircraft instrument panels flown under IFR. These are the  ASI, sensitive altimeter, and vertical speed indicator (VSI).  All three instruments receive static air pressure for operation  with only the ASI receiving both pitot and static pressure.  [Figure 5-2]  

# Blockage of the Pitot-Static System  

Errors in the ASI and VSI almost always indicate a blockage  of the pitot tube, the static port(s), or both. Moisture  (including ice), dirt, or even insects can cause a blockage in  both systems. During preflight, it is very important to make  sure the pitot tube cover is removed and that static port  openings are checked for blockage and damage.  

# Blocked Pitot System  

If the pitot tube drain hole becomes obstructed, the pitot  system can become partially or completely blocked. When  dynamic pressure cannot enter the pitot tube opening, the ASI  no longer operates. If the drain hole is open, static pressure  equalizes on both sides of the diaphram in the ASI and the

indicated airspeed slowly drops to zero. If the pitot tube ram  pressure hole and drain hole become obstructed,  the ASI  operates like an altimeter as the aircraft climbs and descends.  Refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25A) for more in depth information on  blocked pitot systems along with different scenarios and  how they effect the ASI.  

# Blocked Static System  

When a static system becomes blocked but the pitot tube  remains clear the ASI continues to operate but is inaccurate.  When the aircraft is operated above the altitude where the  static ports became blocked the airspeed indicates lower  than the actual airspeed because the trapped static pressure  is higher than normal for that altitude. The opposite holds  true for operations at lower altitudes; a faster than actual  airspeed is displayed due to the relatively low static pressure  trapped in the system.  

A blockage of the static system can also affect the altimeter  and VSI. Trapped static pressure causes the altimeter to  freeze at the altitude where the blockage occurred. In the case  of the VSI, a blocked static system produces a continuous  zero indication.  

An alternate static source is provided in some aircraft to  provide static pressure should the primary static source  become blocked. The alternate static source is normally found  inside of the flight deck. Due to the venturi effect of the air  flowing around the fuselage, the air pressure inside the flight  deck is lower than the exterior pressure.  

When the alternate static source pressure is used, the  following instrument indications are observed:  

1.	 The altimeter indicates a slightly higher altitude than  actual. 2.	 The ASI indicates an airspeed greater than the actual  airspeed. 3.	 The VSI shows a momentary climb and then stabilizes  if the altitude is held constant.  

For more information on static system blockages and how to  best react to such situations, refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25A).  

# Effects of Flight Conditions  

The static ports are located in a position where the air at  their surface is as undisturbed as possible. But under some  flight conditions, particularly at a high angle of attack with  the landing gear and flaps down, the air around the static  port may be disturbed to the extent that it can cause an error  in the indication of the altimeter and ASI. Because of the  importance of accuracy in these instruments, part of the  certification tests for an aircraft is a check of position error  in the static system.  

The Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)/Aircraft Flight  Manual (AFM) contains any corrections that must be applied  to the airspeed for the various configurations of flaps and  landing gear.  

# Pitot/Static Instruments  

# Sensitive Altimeter  

A sensitive altimeter is an aneroid barometer that measures  the absolute pressure of the ambient air and displays it in  terms of feet or meters above a selected pressure level.  

# Principle of Operation  

The sensitive element in a sensitive altimeter is a stack of  evacuated, corrugated bronze aneroid capsules.  [Figure 5-3] The air pressure acting on these aneroids tries to compress  them against their natural springiness, which tries to expand  them. The result is that their thickness changes as the air  pressure changes. Stacking several aneroids increases the  dimension change as the pressure varies over the usable  range of the instrument.  

Below 10,000 feet, a striped segment is visible. Above this  altitude, a mask begins to cover it, and above 15,000 feet,  all of the stripes are covered.  [Figure 5-4]  

Another configuration of the altimeter is the drum-type.  [Figure 5-5]  These instruments have only one pointer that

makes one revolution for every 1,000 feet. Each number  represents 100 feet and each mark represents 20 feet. A drum,  marked in thousands of feet, is geared to the mechanism that  drives the pointer. To read this type of altimeter, first look at  the drum to get the thousands of feet, and then at the pointer  to get the feet and hundreds of feet.  

A sensitive altimeter is one with an adjustable barometric scale  allowing the pilot to set the reference pressure from which the  altitude is measured. This scale is visible in a small window  called the Kollsman window. A knob on the instrument adjusts  the scale. The range of the scale is from 28.00 to 31.00 inches  of mercury   $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$  , or 948 to 1,050 millibars.  

Rotating the knob changes both the barometric scale and the  altimeter pointers in such a way that a change in the barometric  scale of   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   changes the pointer indication by 1,000 feet.  This is the standard pressure lapse rate below 5,000 feet.  When the barometric scale is adjusted to  $29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}$   or 1,013.2  millibars, the pointers indicate the pressure altitude. The pilot  displays indicate altitude by adjusting the barometric scale  to the local altimeter setting. The altimeter then indicates the  height above the existing sea level pressure.  

# Altimeter Errors  

A sensitive altimeter is designed to indicate standard changes  from standard conditions, but most flying involves errors  caused by nonstandard conditions and the pilot must be able  to modify the indications to correct for these errors. There  are two types of errors: mechanical and inherent.  

Mechanical Altimeter Errors  

A preflight check to determine the condition of an altimeter  consists of setting the barometric scale to the local altimeter  setting. The altimeter should indicate the surveyed elevation  of the airport. If the indication is off by more than 75 feet from  the surveyed elevation, the instrument should be referred  to a certificated instrument repair station for recalibration.  Differences between ambient temperature and/or pressure  causes an erroneous indication on the altimeter.  

# Inherent Altimeter Error  

When the aircraft is flying in air that is warmer than standard,  the air is less dense and the pressure levels are farther apart.  When the aircraft is flying at an indicated altitude of 5,000  feet, the pressure level for that altitude is higher than it would  be in air at standard temperature, and the aircraft is higher  than it would be if the air were cooler. If the air is colder  than standard, it is denser and the pressure levels are closer  together. When the aircraft is flying at an indicated altitude  of 5,000 feet, its true altitude is lower than it would be if the  air were warmer.  [Figure 5-6]  

# Cold Weather Altimeter Errors  

A correctly calibrated pressure altimeter indicates true  altitude above mean sea level (MSL) when operating within  the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) parameters of  pressure and temperature. Nonstandard pressure conditions are  corrected by applying the correct local area altimeter setting.  

Temperature errors from ISA result in true altitude being  higher than indicated altitude whenever the temperature is  warmer than ISA and true altitude being lower than indicated  altitude whenever the temperature is colder than ISA.  True altitude variance under conditions of colder than ISA  temperatures poses the risk of inadequate obstacle clearance.  

Under extremely cold conditions, pilots may need to add an  appropriate temperature correction determined from the chart  in  Figure 5-7  to charted IFR altitudes to ensure terrain and  obstacle clearance with the following restrictions:  

•	 Altitudes specifically assigned by Air Traffic Control  (ATC), such as “maintain 5,000 feet” shall not be  corrected. Assigned altitudes may be rejected if the  pilot decides that low temperatures pose a risk of  inadequate terrain or obstacle clearance. •	 If temperature corrections are applied to charted  IFR altitudes (such as procedure turn altitudes, final  approach fix crossing altitudes, etc.), the pilot must  advise ATC of the applied correction.  

# ICAO Cold Temperature Error Table  

The cold temperature induced altimeter error may be  significant when considering obstacle clearances when  temperatures are well below standard. Pilots may wish to  increase their minimum terrain clearance altitudes with a  corresponding increase in ceiling from the normal minimum  when flying in extreme cold temperature conditions. Higher  altitudes may need to be selected when flying at low terrain  clearances. Most flight management systems (FMS) with  air data computers implement a capability to compensate  for cold temperature errors. Pilots flying with these systems  should ensure they are aware of the conditions under which  the system automatically compensates. If compensation is  applied by the FMS or manually, ATC must be informed  that the aircraft is not flying the assigned altitude. Otherwise,  vertical separation from other aircraft may be reduced creating  a potentially hazardous situation. The table in  Figure 5-7 ,  derived from International Civil Aviation Organization  

![](images/54ad4e03f0edaaefc7d8c2fee67d6bdfc422962e716cf996204997d4be153f71.jpg)

(ICAO) standard formulas, shows how much error can exist  when the temperature is extremely cold. To use the table, find  the reported temperature in the left column, and then read  across the top row to the height above the airport/reporting  station. Subtract the airport elevation from the altitude of the  final approach fix (FAF). The intersection of the column and  row is the amount of possible error.  

Example: The reported temperature is  $-10$   degrees Celsius   $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   and the FAF is 500 feet above the airport elevation. The  reported current altimeter setting may place the aircraft as  much as 50 feet below the altitude indicated by the altimeter.  

When using the cold temperature error table, the altitude  error is proportional to both the height above the reporting  station elevation and the temperature at the reporting  station. For IFR approach procedures, the reporting station  elevation is assumed to be airport elevation. It is important  to understand that corrections are based upon the temperature  at the reporting station, not the temperature observed at the  aircraft’s current altitude and height above the reporting  station and not the charted IFR altitude.  

To see how corrections are applied, note the following example:  

Airport Elevation	 	 	           496 feet Airport Temperature	 	 	              $-50\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  

A charted IFR approach to the airport provides the following  data:  

Minimum Procedure Turn Altitude	        1,800 feet Minimum FAF Crossing Altitude	        1,200 feet Straight-in Minimum Descent Altitude	           800 feet Circling Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA)    1,000 feet  

The Minimum Procedure Turn Altitude of 1,800 feet is used  as an example to demonstrate determination of the appropriate  temperature correction. Typically, altitude values are rounded  up to the nearest 100-foot level. The charted procedure turn  altitude of 1,800 feet minus the airport elevation of 500 feet  equals 1,300 feet. The altitude difference of 1,300 feet falls  between the correction chart elevations of 1,000 feet and 1,500  feet. At the station temperature of  $-50\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the correction falls  between 300 feet and 450 feet. Dividing the difference in  compensation values by the difference in altitude above the  airport gives the error value per foot.  

In this case, 150 feet divided by 500 feet  $=0.33$   feet for each  additional foot of altitude above 1,000 feet. This provides a  correction of 300 feet for the first 1,000 feet and an additional  value of 0.33 times 300 feet, or 99 feet, which is rounded to  100 feet. 300 feet  $+~100$   feet  $=$   total temperature correction  of 400 feet. For the given conditions, correcting the charted  value of 1,800 feet above MSL (equal to a height above the  reporting station of 1,300 feet) requires the addition of 400  feet. Thus, when flying at an indicated altitude of 2,200 feet,  the aircraft is actually flying a true altitude of 1,800 feet.  

Minimum Procedure Turn Altitude  

1,800 feet charted 	    $=$  	       2,200 feet corrected Minimum FAF Crossing Altitude	 1,200 feet charted 	    $=$  	       1,500 feet corrected Straight-in MDA	 800 feet charted 	 	    $=$  	          900 feet corrected Circling MDA	 1,000 feet charted 	    $=$  	       1,200 feet corrected  

# Nonstandard Pressure on an Altimeter  

Maintaining a current altimeter setting is critical because the  atmosphere pressure is not constant. That is, in one location  the pressure might be higher than the pressure just a short  distance away. Take an aircraft whose altimeter setting is set  to  $29.92"$   of local pressure. As the aircraft moves to an area  of lower pressure (Point A to B in  Figure 5-8 ) and the pilot  fails to readjust the altimeter setting (essentially calibrating  it to local pressure), then as the pressure decreases, the true  altitude is lower. Adjusting the altimeter settings compensates  for this. When the altimeter shows an indicated altitude of  5,000 feet, the true altitude at Point A (the height above  mean sea level) is only 3,500 feet at Point B. The fact that  the altitude indication is not always true lends itself to the  memory aid, “When flying from hot to cold or from a high  to a low, look out below.”  [Figure 5-8]  

![](images/5757e2bc23e21e3743564d20c1862928ed316a4d8cf3df9f470f5c81e19b70a9.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.   Effects of nonstandard pressure on an altimeter of an  aircraft flown into air of lower than standard pressure (air is less  dense).  

# Altimeter Enhancements (Encoding)  

It is not sufficient in the airspace system for only the pilot  to have an indication of the aircraft’s altitude; the air traffic  controller on the ground must also know the altitude of the  aircraft. To provide this information, the aircraft is typically  equipped with an encoding altimeter.  

When the ATC transponder is set to Mode C, the encoding  altimeter supplies the transponder with a series of pulses  identifying the flight level (in increments of 100 feet) at  which the aircraft is flying. This series of pulses is transmitted  to the ground radar where they appear on the controller’s  scope as an alphanumeric display around the return for the  aircraft. The transponder allows the ground controller to  identify the aircraft and determine the pressure altitude at  which it is flying.  

A computer inside the encoding altimeter measures the  pressure referenced from  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   and delivers this data to  the transponder. When the pilot adjusts the barometric scale  to the local altimeter setting, the data sent to the transponder  is not affected. This is to ensure that all Mode C aircraft are  transmitting data referenced to a common pressure level. ATC  equipment adjusts the displayed altitudes to compensate for  local pressure differences allowing display of targets at correct  altitudes. 14 CFR part 91 requires the altitude transmitted by  the transponder to be within 125 feet of the altitude indicated  on the instrument used to maintain flight altitude.  

# Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM)  

Below 31,000 feet, a 1,000 foot separation is the minimum  required between usable flight levels. Flight levels (FLs)  generally start at 18,000 feet where the local pressure is   $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   or greater. All aircraft 18,000 feet and above use  a standard altimeter setting of   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , and the altitudes  are in reference to a standard hence termed FL. Between FL  180 and FL 290, the minimum altitude separation is 1,000  feet between aircraft. However, for flight above FL 290  (primarily due to aircraft equipage and reporting capability;  potential error) ATC applied the requirement of 2,000 feet of  separation. FL 290, an altitude appropriate for an eastbound  aircraft, would be followed by FL 310 for a westbound  aircraft, and so on to FL 410, or seven FLs available for flight.  With 1,000-foot separation, or a reduction of the vertical  separation between FL 290 and FL 410, an additional six  FLs become available. This results in normal flight level and  direction management being maintained from FL 180 through  FL 410. Hence the name is Reduced Vertical Separation  Minimum (RVSM). Because it is applied domestically, it is  called United States Domestic Reduced Vertical Separation  Minimum (DRVSM).  

However, there is a cost to participate in the DRVSM program  which relates to both aircraft equipage and pilot training. For  example, altimetry error must be reduced significantly and  operators using RVSM must receive authorization from the  appropriate civil aviation authority. RVSM aircraft must meet  required altitude-keeping performance standards. Additionally,  operators must operate in accordance with RVSM policies/ procedures applicable to the airspace where they are flying.  

The aircraft must be equipped with at least one automatic  altitude control—  

•	 Within a tolerance band of  $\pm65$   feet about an acquired  altitude when the aircraft is operated in straight-and- level flight. •	 Within a tolerance band of   $\pm130$   feet under no  turbulent, conditions for aircraft for which application  for type certification occurred on or before April 9,  1997 that are equipped with an automatic altitude  control system with flight management/performance  system inputs.  

That aircraft must be equipped with an altitude alert system  that signals an alert when the altitude displayed to the flight  crew deviates from the selected altitude by more than (in most  cases) 200 feet. For each condition in the full RVSM flight  envelope, the largest combined absolute value for residual  static source error plus the avionics error may not exceed 200  feet. Aircraft with TCAS must have compatibility with RVSM  Operations.  Figure 5-9  illustrates the increase in aircraft  permitted between FL 180 and FL 410. Most noteworthy,  however, is the economization that aircraft can take advantage  of by the higher FLs being available to more aircraft.  

![](images/c8f07eb7724907d8dc6fba564f11c4b0601438048c92f29fc68ae1c661520342.jpg)

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

The VSI in  Figure 5-10  is also called a vertical velocity  indicator (VVI), and was formerly known as a rate-of-climb  indicator. It is a rate-of-pressure change instrument that gives  an indication of any deviation from a constant pressure level.  

Inside the instrument case is an aneroid very much like the one  in an ASI. Both the inside of this aneroid and the inside of the  instrument case are vented to the static system, but the case  is vented through a calibrated orifice that causes the pressure  inside the case to change more slowly than the pressure inside  the aneroid. As the aircraft ascends, the static pressure becomes  lower. The pressure inside the case compresses the aneroid,  moving the pointer upward, showing a climb and indicating  the rate of ascent in number of feet per minute (fpm).  

When the aircraft levels off, the pressure no longer changes.  The pressure inside the case becomes equal to that inside  

![](images/02967da2da468a84c2b8f5c95e6d811cc0c566bb049ab33a02a0ddb6251e7b62.jpg)  
Figure 5-10.   Rate of climb or descent in thousands of feet per minute.  

the aneroid, and the pointer returns to its horizontal, or  zero, position. When the aircraft descends, the static  pressure increases. The aneroid expands, moving the pointer  downward, indicating a descent.  

The pointer indication in a VSI lags a few seconds behind the  actual change in pressure. However, it is more sensitive than  an altimeter and is useful in alerting the pilot of an upward or  downward trend, thereby helping maintain a constant altitude.  

Some of the more complex VSIs, called instantaneous vertical  speed indicators (IVSI), have two accelerometer-actuated air  pumps that sense an upward or downward pitch of the aircraft  and instantaneously create a pressure differential. By the time  the pressure caused by the pitch acceleration dissipates, the  altitude pressure change is effective.  

# Dynamic Pressure Type Instruments Airspeed Indicator (ASI)  

An ASI is a differential pressure gauge that measures the  dynamic pressure of the air through which the aircraft is  flying. Dynamic pressure is the difference in the ambient  static air pressure and the total, or ram, pressure caused by  the motion of the aircraft through the air. These two pressures  are taken from the pitot-static system.  

The mechanism of the ASI in  Figure 5-11  consists of a thin,  corrugated phosphor bronze aneroid, or diaphragm, that  receives its pressure from the pitot tube. The instrument  case is sealed and connected to the static ports. As the  pitot pressure increases or the static pressure decreases, the  diaphragm expands. This dimensional change is measured by  a rocking shaft and a set of gears that drives a pointer across  the instrument dial. Most ASIs are calibrated in knots, or  nautical miles per hour; some instruments show statute miles  per hour, and some instruments show both.

Figure 5-11.   Mechanism of an ASI.  

# Types of Airspeed  

Just as there are several types of altitude, there are multiple  types of airspeed: indicated airspeed (IAS), calibrated  airspeed (CAS), equivalent airspeed (EAS), and true airspeed  (TAS).  

# Indicated Airspeed (IAS)  

IAS is shown on the dial of the instrument, uncorrected for  instrument or system errors.  

# Calibrated Airspeed (CAS)  

CAS is the speed at which the aircraft is moving through  the air, which is found by correcting IAS for instrument  and position errors. The POH/AFM has a chart or graph to  correct IAS for these errors and provide the correct CAS for  the various flap and landing gear configurations.  

# Equivalent Airspeed (EAS)  

EAS is CAS corrected for compression of the air inside the  pitot tube. EAS is the same as CAS in standard atmosphere  at sea level. As the airspeed and pressure altitude increase,  the CAS becomes higher than it should be, and a correction  for compression must be subtracted from the CAS.  

# True Airspeed (TAS)  

TAS is CAS corrected for nonstandard pressure and  temperature. TAS and CAS are the same in standard  atmosphere at sea level. Under nonstandard conditions, TAS  is found by applying a correction for pressure altitude and  temperature to the CAS.  

Some aircraft are equipped with true ASIs that have a  temperature-compensated aneroid bellows inside the  instrument case. This bellows modifies the movement of  the rocking shaft inside the instrument case so the pointer  shows the actual TAS.  

The TAS indicator provides both true and IAS. These  instruments have the conventional airspeed mechanism,  with an added subdial visible through cutouts in the regular  dial. A knob on the instrument allows the pilot to rotate the  subdial and align an indication of the outside air temperature  with the pressure altitude being flown. This alignment causes  the instrument pointer to indicate the TAS on the subdial.  [Figure 5-12]  

![](images/0d1cbc6373906e0dc6ad8cf532ec354230256cbad5c9860292f2852674a15fa6.jpg)  
Figure 5-12. Figure 3-12.   A true ASI allows the pilot to correct IAS for  correct indicated airspeed for nonstandard temperature and  

# Mach Number  

As an aircraft approaches the speed of sound, the air flowing  over certain areas of its surface speeds up until it reaches  the speed of sound, and shock waves form. The IAS at  which these conditions occur changes with temperature.  Therefore, in this case, airspeed is not entirely adequate to  warn the pilot of the impending problems. Mach number  is more useful. Mach number is the ratio of the TAS of  the aircraft to the speed of sound in the same atmospheric  conditions. An aircraft flying at the speed of sound is flying  at Mach 1.0. Some older mechanical Machmeters not driven  from an air data computer use an altitude aneroid inside  the instrument that converts pitot-static pressure into Mach  number. These systems assume that the temperature at any  altitude is standard; therefore, the indicated Mach number is  inaccurate whenever the temperature deviates from standard.  These systems are called indicated Machmeters. Modern  electronic Machmeters use information from an air data  computer system to correct for temperature errors. These  systems display true Mach number.  

Most high-speed aircraft are limited to a maximum Mach  number at which they can fly. This is shown on a Machmeter  as a decimal fraction.  [Figure 5-13]  For example, if the  Machmeter indicates .83 and the aircraft is flying at 30,000  feet where the speed of sound under standard conditions is  589.5 knots, the airspeed is 489.3 knots. The speed of sound  varies with the air temperature. If the aircraft were flying at  Mach .83 at 10,000 feet where the air is much warmer, its  airspeed would be 530 knots.

# Maximum Allowable Airspeed  

Some aircraft that fly at high subsonic speeds are equipped  with maximum allowable ASIs like the one in  Figure 5-14 .  This instrument looks much like a standard ASI, calibrated  in knots, but has an additional pointer colored red, checkered,  

![](images/b9593f2d66c7d4805c9157ade11df416fc40a8abe57036c4fd70d36f68115c3e.jpg)

or striped. The maximum airspeed pointer is actuated by an  aneroid, or altimeter mechanism, that moves it to a lower  value as air density decreases. By keeping the airspeed pointer  at a lower value than the maximum pointer, the pilot avoids  the onset of transonic shock waves.  

# Airspeed Color Codes  

The dial of an ASI is color coded to alert the pilot, at a  glance, of the significance of the speed at which the aircraft  is flying. These colors and their associated airspeeds are  shown in  Figure 5-15 .  

# Magnetism  

The Earth is a huge magnet, spinning in space, surrounded  by a magnetic field made up of invisible lines of flux. These  lines leave the surface at the magnetic North Pole and reenter  at the magnetic South Pole.  

Lines of magnetic flux have two important characteristics:  any magnet that is free to rotate aligns with them, and an  electrical current is induced into any conductor that cuts  across them. Most direction indicators installed in aircraft  make use of one of these two characteristics.  

# The Basic Aviation Magnetic Compass  

One of the oldest and simplest instruments for indicating  direction is the magnetic compass. It is also one of the basic  instruments required by 14 CFR part 91 for both VFR and  IFR flight.  

# Magnetic Compass Overview  

A magnet is a piece of material, usually a metal containing  iron, which attracts and holds lines of magnetic flux.  Regardless of size, every magnet has two poles: a north  pole and a south pole. When one magnet is placed in the  

![](images/266839e2d172b37acb03ce6470e50f6affaa2f82bd4bd9106497b065fec41552.jpg)  
Figure 5-15.  Color codes for an ASI.  

field of another, the unlike poles attract each other and like  poles repel.  

An aircraft magnetic compass, such as the one in  Figure 5-16 ,  has two small magnets attached to a metal float sealed inside a  bowl of clear compass fluid similar to kerosene. A graduated  scale, called a card, is wrapped around the float and viewed  through a glass window with a lubber line across it. The card  is marked with letters representing the cardinal directions,  north, east, south, and west, and a number for each   $30^{\circ}$    between these letters. The final   $^{\bullet}\!_{0}^{\bullet},$   is omitted from these  directions; for example,   $3=30^{\circ}$  ,   $6=60^{\circ}$  , and   $33=330^{\circ}$  .  There are long and short graduation marks between the letters  and numbers, with each long mark representing  $10^{\circ}$   and each  short mark representing  $5^{\circ}$  .  

![](images/0899773e1f3e2c83943a70e50f15289e558ec7f6013db5de370335e7e08968fe.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.   A magnetic compass. The vertical line is called the  lubber line.  

Magnetic Compass Construction  

The float and card assembly has a hardened steel pivot in its  center that rides inside a special, spring-loaded, hard-glass  jewel cup. The buoyancy of the float takes most of the weight  off the pivot, and the fluid damps the oscillation of the float  and card. This jewel-and-pivot type mounting allows the float  freedom to rotate and tilt up to approximately   $18^{\circ}$   angle of  bank. At steeper bank angles, the compass indications are  erratic and unpredictable.  

The compass housing is entirely full of compass fluid. To  prevent damage or leakage when the fluid expands and  contracts with temperature changes, the rear of the compass  case is sealed with a flexible diaphragm, or with a metal  bellows in some compasses.  

Magnetic Compass Theory of Operations  

The magnets align with the Earth’s magnetic field and the  pilot reads the direction on the scale opposite the lubber line.  Note that in  Figure 5-16 , the pilot sees the compass card from  its backside. When the pilot is flying north as the compass  shows, east is to the pilot’s right, but on the card “  $"33"$  , which  represents  $330^{\circ}$   (west of north), is to the right of north. The  reason for this apparent backward graduation is that the card  remains stationary, and the compass housing and the pilot  turn around it, always viewing the card from its backside.  

Magnetic fields caused by aircraft electronics and wiring  can effect the accuracy of the magnetic compass. This  induced error is called compass deviation. Compensator  assemblies mounted on the compass allow aviation  maintenance technicians (AMTs) to calibrate the compass  by creating magnetic fields inside of the compass housing.  The compensator assembly has two shafts whose ends have  screwdriver slots accessible from the front of the compass.  Each shaft rotates one or two small compensating magnets.  The end of one shaft is marked E-W, and its magnets affect  the compass when the aircraft is pointed east or west. The  other shaft is marked N-S and its magnets affect the compass  when the aircraft is pointed north or south.  

# Magnetic Compass Errors  

The magnetic compass is the simplest instrument in the panel,  but it is subject to a number of errors that must be considered.  

# Variation  

The Earth rotates about its geographic axis; maps and charts  are drawn using meridians of longitude that pass through the  geographic poles. Directions measured from the geographic  poles are called true directions. The north magnetic pole to  which the magnetic compass points is not collocated with  the geographic north pole, but is some 1,300 miles away;  directions measured from the magnetic poles are called  magnetic directions. In aerial navigation, the difference  between true and magnetic directions is called variation. This  same angular difference in surveying and land navigation is  called declination.  

Figure 5-17  shows the isogonic lines that identify the number  of degrees of variation in their area. The line that passes near  Chicago is called the agonic line. Anywhere along this line  the two poles are aligned, and there is no variation. East of  this line, the magnetic pole is to the west of the geographic  pole and a correction must be applied to a compass indication  to get a true direction.  

Flying in the Washington, D.C. area, for example, the  variation is  $10^{\circ}$   west. If the pilot wants to fly a true course of  south   $(180^{\circ})$  , the variation must be added to this resulting in  a magnetic course to fly of   $190^{\circ}$  . Flying in the Los Angeles,  CA area, the variation is  $14^{\circ}$   east. To fly a true course of  $180^{\circ}$  there, the pilot would have to subtract the variation and fly a  magnetic course of  $166^{\circ}$  . The variation error does not change  with the heading of the aircraft; it is the same anywhere along  the isogonic line.  

# Deviation  

The magnets in a compass align with any magnetic field.  Local magnetic fields in an aircraft caused by electrical  current flowing in the structure, in nearby wiring or any  magnetized part of the structure, conflict with the Earth’s  magnetic field and cause a compass error called deviation.  

Deviation, unlike variation, is different on each heading, but  it is not affected by the geographic location. Variation error  cannot be reduced or changed, but deviation error can be  minimized when a pilot or AMT performs the maintenance  task known as “swinging the compass.”  

Some airports have a compass rose, which is a series of lines  marked out on a taxiway or ramp at some location where there

is no magnetic interference. Lines, oriented to magnetic north,  are painted every  $30^{\circ}$  , as shown in  Figure 5-18 .

A Compass rose upon which deviation error is compensated for.  Figure 5-18. Utilization of a compass rose aids compensation for  deviation errors.  

The pilot or AMT aligns the aircraft on each magnetic  heading and adjusts the compensating magnets to minimize  the difference between the compass indication and the actual  magnetic heading of the aircraft. Any error that cannot be  removed is recorded on a compass correction card, like the  one in  Figure 5-19 , and placed in a cardholder near the  compass. If the pilot wants to fly a magnetic heading of   $120^{\circ}$   and the aircraft is operating with the radios on, the pilot  should fly a compass heading of   $123^{\circ}$  .  

![](images/330a50748bd273c321be8e2cc83c1b3685832f764e15ddf8fc58f56ad344941b.jpg)  

The corrections for variation and deviation must be applied  in the correct sequence as shown below starting from the  true course desired.  

Step 1: Determine the Magnetic Course True Course   $(180^{\circ})\pm1$  Variation   $(+10^{\circ})\,{=}$   Magnetic Course   $(190^{\circ})$  

The Magnetic Course  $(190^{\circ})$   is steered if there is no deviation  error to be applied. The compass card must now be considered  for the compass course of   $190^{\circ}$  .  

Step 2: Determine the Compass Course Magnetic Course (  $.190^{\circ}$  , from step 1)  $\pm$   Deviation   $(-2^{\circ}$  , from  correction card)  $=$  Compass Course   $(188^{\circ})$  )  

NOTE: Intermediate magnetic courses between those listed  on the compass card need to be interpreted. Therefore, to  steer a true course of  $180^{\circ}$  , the pilot would follow a compass  course of   $188^{\circ}$  .  

To find true course when the compass course is known, remove  the variation and deviation corrections previously applied:  

Compass Course  $\pm$   Deviation  $=$   Magnetic Course  $\pm$   Variation   $=$  True Course  

# Northerly Turning Errors  

The center of gravity of the float assembly is located lower  than the pivotal point. As the airplane turns, the force that  results from the magnetic dip causes the float assembly to  swing in the same direction that the float turns. The result  is a false northerly turn indication. Because of this lead of  the compass card, or float assembly, a northerly turn should  be stopped prior to arrival at the desired heading. This  compass error is amplified with the proximity to either pole.  One rule of thumb to correct for this leading error is to stop  the turn   $15^{\circ}$   plus half of the latitude (i.e., if the airplane is  being operated in a position around the   $40^{\circ}$   of latitude, the  turn should be stopped   $15^{\circ}+20^{\circ}=35^{\circ}$   prior to the desired  heading).  [Figure 5-20A]  

# Southerly Turning Errors  

When turning in a southerly direction, the forces are such that  the compass float assembly lags rather than leads. The result  is a false southerly turn indication. The compass card, or float  assembly, should be allowed to pass the desired heading prior  to stopping the turn. As with the northerly error, this error is  amplified with the proximity to either pole. To correct this  lagging error, the aircraft should be allowed to pass the desired  heading prior to stopping the turn. The same rule of  $15^{\circ}$   plus  half of the latitude applies here (i.e., if the airplane is being  operated in a position around the   $30^{\circ}$   of latitude, the turn  should be stopped   $15^{\circ}+15^{\circ}+30^{\circ}$   after passing the desired  heading).  [Figure 5-20B]  

# Acceleration Error  

The magnetic dip and the forces of inertia cause magnetic  compass errors when accelerating and decelerating on Easterly  and westerly headings. Because of the pendulous-type  mounting, the aft end of the compass card is tilted upward  when accelerating, and downward when decelerating during  

![](images/e170616463114521425a4d195d1c90c26fbf68916b4189e5f587440f2a8096d0.jpg)

changes of airspeed. When accelerating on either an easterly  or westerly heading , the error appears as a turn indication  toward north. When decelerating on either of these headings,  the compass indicates a turn toward south. The word "ANDS"  (Acceleration-North/Deceleration-South) may help you to  remember the acceleration error.  [Figure 5-21]  

# Oscillation Error  

Oscillation is a combination of all of the other errors, and it  results in the compass card swinging back and forth around  the heading being flown. When setting the gyroscopic  heading indicator to agree with the magnetic compass, use  the average indication between the swings.  

![](images/3d33d0ea4d3850351f7e9a10da0c6e3d4dbf3bfe930efb8980c8b04d978dd033.jpg)  
Figure 5-21.  The effects of acceleration error.  

# The Vertical Card Magnetic Compass  

The floating magnet type of compass not only has all the  errors just described, but also lends itself to confused reading.  It is easy to begin a turn in the wrong direction because its card  appears backward. East is on what the pilot would expect to be  the west side. The vertical card magnetic compass eliminates  some of the errors and confusion. The dial of this compass  is graduated with letters representing the cardinal directions,  numbers every  $30^{\circ}$  , and marks every  $5^{\circ}$  . The dial is rotated by  a set of gears from the shaft-mounted magnet, and the nose  of the symbolic airplane on the instrument glass represents  the lubber line for reading the heading of the aircraft from  the dial. Eddy currents induced into an aluminum-damping  cup damp oscillation of the magnet.  [Figure 5-22]

# The Flux Gate Compass System  

As mentioned earlier, the lines of flux in the Earth’s magnetic  field have two basic characteristics: a magnet aligns with  these lines, and an electrical current is induced, or generated,  in any wire crossed by them.  

The flux gate compass that drives slaved gyros uses the  characteristic of current induction. The flux valve is a small,  segmented ring, like the one in  Figure 5-23 , made of soft iron  that readily accepts lines of magnetic flux. An electrical coil  is wound around each of the three legs to accept the current  induced in this ring by the Earth’s magnetic field. A coil  wound around the iron spacer in the center of the frame has   $400–\mathrm{Hz}$   alternating current (A.C.) flowing through it. During  the times when this current reaches its peak, twice during each  cycle, there is so much magnetism produced by this coil that  the frame cannot accept the lines of flux from the Earth’s field.  

But as the current reverses between the peaks, it demagnetizes  the frame so it can accept the flux from the Earth’s field. As  this flux cuts across the windings in the three coils, it causes  current to flow in them. These three coils are connected in  

![](images/5b7ca47d7d37073ed95be882b669a0245c987577ad76b56f9da9564d81c30b29.jpg)

This flux causes current to flow in the three pickup coils. center coil reverse. This flux causes current to flow in the three  

picked coils. such a way that the current flowing in them changes as the  heading of the aircraft changes.  [Figure 5-24]

The three coils are connected to three similar but smaller coils  in a synchro inside the instrument case. The synchro rotates  the dial of a radio magnetic indicator (RMI) or a horizontal  situation indicator (HSI).  

# Remote Indicating Compass  

Remote indicating compasses were developed to compensate  for the errors and limitations of the older type of heading  indicators. The two panel-mounted components of a typical  system are the pictorial navigation indicator and the slaving  control and compensator unit.  [Figure 5-25]  The pictorial  navigation indicator is commonly referred to as an HSI.  

![](images/2cbda2d12682a06a99bdb27a69fc03c7b4b2c45f2a8b7a78b5ee983aa13d1a31.jpg)  
Figure 5-25.   The pictorial navigation indicator is commonly  referred to as an HSI.  

The slaving control and compensator unit has a pushbutton  that provides a means of selecting either the “slaved gyro”  or “free gyro” mode. This unit also has a slaving meter  and two manual heading-drive buttons. The slaving meter  indicates the difference between the displayed heading  and the magnetic heading. A right deflection indicates a  clockwise error of the compass card; a left deflection indicates  a counterclockwise error. Whenever the aircraft is in a turn  and the card rotates, the slaving meter shows a full deflection  to one side or the other. When the system is in “free gyro”  mode, the compass card may be adjusted by depressing the  appropriate heading-drive button.  

A separate unit, the magnetic slaving transmitter is mounted  remotely; usually in a wingtip to eliminate the possibility of  magnetic interference. It contains the flux valve, which is  the direction-sensing device of the system. A concentration  of lines of magnetic force, after being amplified, becomes  a signal relayed to the heading indicator unit, which is also  remotely mounted. This signal operates a torque motor in  the heading indicator unit that processes the gyro unit until  it is aligned with the transmitter signal. The magnetic slaving  transmitter is connected electrically to the HSI.  

There are a number of designs of the remote indicating  compass; therefore, only the basic features of the system are  covered here. Instrument pilots must become familiar with  the characteristics of the equipment in their aircraft.  

As instrument panels become more crowded and the pilot’s  available scan time is reduced by a heavier flight deck  workload, instrument manufacturers have worked toward  combining instruments. One good example of this is the  RMI in  Figure 5-26 . The compass card is driven by signals  from the flux valve, and the two pointers are driven by an  automatic direction finder (ADF) and a very high frequency  omnidirectional range (VOR).

Figure 5-26.   Driven by signals from a flux valve, the compass card  in this RMI indicates the heading of the aircraft opposite the upper  center index mark. The green pointer is driven by the ADF. The  yellow pointer is driven by the VOR receiver.  

# Gyroscopic Systems  

Flight without reference to a visible horizon can be safely  accomplished by the use of gyroscopic instrument systems  and the two characteristics of gyroscopes, which are rigidity  and precession. These systems include attitude, heading,  and rate instruments, along with their power sources. These  instruments include a gyroscope (or gyro) that is a small wheel  with its weight concentrated around its periphery. When this  wheel is spun at high speed, it becomes rigid and resists tilting  or turning in any direction other than around its spin axis.  

Attitude and heading instruments operate on the principle  of rigidity. For these instruments, the gyro remains rigid  in its case and the aircraft rotates about it. Rate indicators,  such as turn indicators and turn coordinators, operate on the  principle of precession. In this case, the gyro precesses (or  rolls over) proportionate to the rate the aircraft rotates about  one or more of its axes.  

# Power Sources  

Aircraft and instrument manufacturers have designed  redundancy in the flight instruments so that any single failure  does not deprive the pilot of the ability to safely conclude  the flight. Gyroscopic instruments are crucial for instrument  flight; therefore, they are powered by separate electrical or  pneumatic sources.  

# Pneumatic Systems  

Pneumatic gyros are driven by a jet of air impinging on  buckets cut into the periphery of the wheel. On many aircraft  this stream of air is obtained by evacuating the instrument  case with a vacuum source and allowing filtered air to flow  into the case through a nozzle to spin the wheel.  

# Venturi Tube Systems  

Aircraft that do not have a pneumatic pump to evacuate the  instrument case can use venturi tubes mounted on the outside  of the aircraft, similar to the system shown in  Figure 5-27 . Air  flowing through the venturi tube speeds up in the narrowest  part and, according to Bernoulli’s principle, the pressure  drops. This location is connected to the instrument case by  a piece of tubing. The two attitude instruments operate on  approximately   $4\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   of suction; the turn-and-slip indicator  needs only   $2\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  , so a pressure-reducing needle valve is  used to decrease the suction. Air flows into the instruments  through filters built into the instrument cases. In this system,  ice can clog the venturi tube and stop the instruments when  they are most needed.  

![](images/10f2915ff85d72af517c8e7571b92e562e6fdfea40badd43ce0270bb48484cc1.jpg)

# Vacuum Pump Systems  

Wet-Type Vacuum Pump  

Steel-vane air pumps have been used for many years to  evacuate the instrument cases. The vanes in these pumps  are lubricated by a small amount of engine oil metered into  the pump and discharged with the air. In some aircraft the  discharge air is used to inflate rubber deicer boots on the  wing and empennage leading edges. To keep the oil from  deteriorating the rubber boots, it must be removed with an  oil separator like the one in  Figure 5-28 .  

The vacuum pump moves a greater volume of air than is  needed to supply the instruments with the suction needed,  so a suction-relief valve is installed in the inlet side of the  pump. This spring-loaded valve draws in just enough air to  maintain the required low pressure inside the instruments,  as is shown on the suction gauge in the instrument panel.  Filtered air enters the instrument cases from a central air  filter. As long as aircraft fly at relatively low altitudes, enough  air is drawn into the instrument cases to spin the gyros at a  sufficiently high speed.  

# Dry Air Vacuum Pump  

As flight altitudes increase, the air is less dense and more air  must be forced through the instruments. Air pumps that do not  mix oil with the discharge air are used in high flying aircraft. Steel vanes sliding in a steel housing need to be lubricated,  but vanes made of a special formulation of carbon sliding  inside carbon housing provide their own lubrication in a  microscopic amount as they wear.  

# Pressure Indicating Systems  

Figure 5-29  is a diagram of the instrument pneumatic system  of a twin-engine general aviation airplane. Two dry air  pumps are used with filters in their inlets to filter out any  contaminants that could damage the fragile carbon vanes in  the pump. The discharge air from the pump flows through  a regulator, where excess air is bled off to maintain the  pressure in the system at the desired level. The regulated air  then flows through inline filters to remove any contamination  that could have been picked up from the pump, and from  there into a manifold check valve. If either engine should  become inoperative or either pump should fail, the check  valve isolates the inoperative system and the instruments are  driven by air from the operating system. After the air passes  through the instruments and drives the gyros, it is exhausted  from the case. The gyro pressure gauge measures the pressure  drop across the instruments.  

# Electrical Systems  

Many general aviation aircraft that use pneumatic attitude  indicators use electric rate indicators and/or the reverse. Some

instruments identify their power source on their dial, but it  is extremely important that pilots consult the POH/AFM to  determine the power source of all instruments to know what  action to take in the event of an instrument failure. Direct  current (D.C.) electrical instruments are available in 14- or  28-volt models, depending upon the electrical system in  the aircraft. A.C. is used to operate some attitude gyros and  autopilots. Aircraft with only D.C. electrical systems can use  A.C. instruments via installation of a solid-state D.C. to A.C.  inverter, which changes 14 or 28 volts D.C. into three-phase  115-volt, 400-Hz A.C.  

# Gyroscopic Instruments  

# Attitude Indicators  

The first attitude instrument (AI) was originally referred to as  an artificial horizon, later as a gyro horizon; now it is more  properly called an attitude indicator. Its operating mechanism  is a small brass wheel with a vertical spin axis, spun at a high  speed by either a stream of air impinging on buckets cut into  its periphery, or by an electric motor. The gyro is mounted in  a double gimbal, which allows the aircraft to pitch and roll  about the gyro as it remains fixed in space.  

A horizon disk is attached to the gimbals so it remains in  the same plane as the gyro, and the aircraft pitches and  rolls about it. On early instruments, this was just a bar that  represented the horizon, but now it is a disc with a line  representing the horizon and both pitch marks and bank-angle  lines. The top half of the instrument dial and horizon disc  is blue, representing the sky; and the bottom half is brown,  representing the ground. A bank index at the top of the  instrument shows the angle of bank marked on the banking  scale with lines that represent   $10^{\circ}$  ,   $20^{\circ}$  ,   $30^{\circ}$  ,  $45^{\circ}$  , and   $60^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 5-30]  

![](images/35a1c28653fb8f776c865f802d3036b91c33fef6f0488e89010b0a583e8d6ecb.jpg)  
Figure 5-30.  The dial of this attitude indicator has reference lines  Figure 3-30.   The dial of this attitude indicator has reference to show pitch and roll.  

A small symbolic aircraft is mounted in the instrument case  so it appears to be flying relative to the horizon. A knob at the  bottom center of the instrument case raises or lowers the aircraft  to compensate for pitch trim changes as the airspeed changes.  The width of the wings of the symbolic aircraft and the dot in the  center of the wings represent a pitch change of approximately  $2^{\circ}$  .  

For an AI to function properly, the gyro must remain  vertically upright while the aircraft rolls and pitches around  it. The bearings in these instruments have a minimum of  friction; however, even this small amount places a restraint  on the gyro producing precession and causing the gyro to tilt.  To minimize this tilting, an erection mechanism inside the  instrument case applies a force any time the gyro tilts from  its vertical position. This force acts in such a way to return  the spinning wheel to its upright position.  

The older artificial horizons were limited in the amount of  pitch or roll they could tolerate, normally about  $60^{\circ}$   in pitch  and   $100^{\circ}$   in roll. After either of these limits was exceeded,  the gyro housing contacted the gimbals, applying such a  precessing force that the gyro tumbled. Because of this  limitation, these instruments had a caging mechanism that  locked the gyro in its vertical position during any maneuvers  that exceeded the instrument limits. Newer instruments do  not have these restrictive tumble limits; therefore, they do  not have a caging mechanism.  

When an aircraft engine is first started and pneumatic or electric  power is supplied to the instruments, the gyro is not erect. A  self-erecting mechanism inside the instrument actuated by the  force of gravity applies a precessing force, causing the gyro to  rise to its vertical position. This erection can take as long as 5  minutes, but is normally done within 2 to 3 minutes.  

Attitude indicators are free from most errors, but depending  upon the speed with which the erection system functions,  there may be a slight nose-up indication during a rapid  acceleration and a nose-down indication during a rapid  deceleration. There is also a possibility of a small bank angle  and pitch error after a   $180^{\circ}$   turn. These inherent errors are  small and correct themselves within a minute or so after  returning to straight-and-level flight.  

# Heading Indicators  

A magnetic compass is a dependable instrument used as a  backup instrument. Although very reliable, it has so many  inherent errors that it has been supplemented with gyroscopic  heading indicators.  

The gyro in a heading indicator is mounted in a double gimbal,  as in an attitude indicator, but its spin axis is horizontal  permitting sensing of rotation about the vertical axis of the  aircraft. Gyro heading indicators, with the exception of slaved  gyro indicators, are not north seeking, therefore they must  be manually set to the appropriate heading by referring to  a magnetic compass. Rigidity causes them to maintain this  heading indication, without the oscillation and other errors  inherent in a magnetic compass.  

Older directional gyros use a drum-like card marked in the  same way as the magnetic compass card. The gyro and the  card remain rigid inside the case with the pilot viewing the  card from the back. This creates the possibility the pilot might  start a turn in the wrong direction similar to using a magnetic  compass. A knob on the front of the instrument, below the  dial, can be pushed in to engage the gimbals. This locks the  gimbals allowing the pilot to rotate the gyro and card until  the number opposite the lubber line agrees with the magnetic  compass. When the knob is pulled out, the gyro remains rigid  and the aircraft is free to turn around the card.  

Directional gyros are almost all air-driven by evacuating the  case and allowing filtered air to flow into the case and out  through a nozzle, blowing against buckets cut in the periphery  of the wheel. The Earth constantly rotates at   $15^{\circ}$   per hour  while the gyro is maintaining a position relative to space, thus  causing an apparent drift in the displayed heading of  $15^{\circ}$   per  hour. When using these instruments, it is standard practice to  compare the heading indicated on the directional gyro with  the magnetic compass at least every 15 minutes and to reset  the heading as necessary to agree with the magnetic compass.  

Heading indicators like the one in  Figure 5-31  work on the  same principle as the older horizontal card indicators, except  that the gyro drives a vertical dial that looks much like the  dial of a vertical card magnetic compass. The heading of the  aircraft is shown against the nose of the symbolic aircraft on

the instrument glass, which serves as the lubber line. A knob  in the front of the instrument may be pushed in and turned  to rotate the gyro and dial. The knob is spring loaded so it  disengages from the gimbals as soon as it is released. This  instrument should be checked about every 15 minutes to see  if it agrees with the magnetic compass.  

# Turn Indicators  

Attitude and heading indicators function on the principle  of rigidity, but rate instruments such as the turn-and- slip indicator operate on precession. Precession is the  characteristic of a gyroscope that causes an applied force to  produce a movement, not at the point of application, but at  a point   $90°$   from the point of application in the direction of  rotation.  [Figure 5-32]  

![](images/64e4be4c52a6356047b4b2d67d8ac2d521c6ca043131c0cf5b6024165695b8f4.jpg)

# Turn-and-Slip Indicator  

The first gyroscopic aircraft instrument was the turn indicator  in the needle and ball, or turn-and-bank indicator, which  has more recently been called a turn-and-slip indicator.  [Figure 5-33]  

The inclinometer in the instrument is a black glass ball sealed  inside a curved glass tube that is partially filled with a liquid  for damping. This ball measures the relative strength of the  force of gravity and the force of inertia caused by a turn.  When the aircraft is flying straight-and-level, there is no  inertia acting on the ball, and it remains in the center of the  tube between two wires. In a turn made with a bank angle  that is too steep, the force of gravity is greater than the inertia  and the ball rolls down to the inside of the turn. If the turn is  

![](images/395273ea73dfcf52c8d7aaa94b87b731c7b2b2f58db25260f10adff2f8585153.jpg)  
Figure 5-33.   Turn-and-slip indicator.  

made with too shallow a bank angle, the inertia is greater than  gravity and the ball rolls upward to the outside of the turn.  

The inclinometer does not indicate the amount of bank, nor  does it indicate slip; it only indicates the relationship between  the angle of bank and the rate of yaw.  

The turn indicator is a small gyro spun either by air or by an  electric motor. The gyro is mounted in a single gimbal with its  spin axis parallel to the lateral axis of the aircraft and the axis  of the gimbal parallel with the longitudinal axis.  [Figure 5-34] When the aircraft yaws, or rotates about its vertical axis, it  produces a force in the horizontal plane that, due to precession,  causes the gyro and its gimbal to rotate about the gimbal’s  axis. It is restrained in this rotation plane by a calibration  spring; it rolls over just enough to cause the pointer to deflect  until it aligns with one of the doghouse-shaped marks on the  dial, when the aircraft is making a standard rate turn.  

The dial of these instruments is marked “2 MIN TURN.”  Some turn-and-slip indicators used in faster aircraft are  marked “4 MIN TURN.” In either instrument, a standard  rate turn is being made whenever the needle aligns with a  doghouse. A standard rate turn is  $3^{\circ}$   per second. In a 2 minute  instrument, if the needle is one needle width either side of  the center alignment mark, the turn is  $3^{\circ}$   per second and the  turn takes 2 minutes to execute a   $360^{\circ}$   turn. In a 4 minute  instrument, the same turn takes two widths deflection of the  needle to achieve  $3^{\circ}$   per second.  

# Turn Coordinator  

The major limitation of the older turn-and-slip indicator is that  it senses rotation only about the vertical axis of the aircraft.  It tells nothing of the rotation around the longitudinal axis,  which in normal flight occurs before the aircraft begins to turn.  

![](images/1c1edd0b717f80a337d5d4f4cac6883549017357bd03d1c48f7db68ccc57ce26.jpg)  
Figure 5-34.   The rate gyro in both turn-and-slip indicator and turn  coordinator.  

A turn coordinator operates on precession, the same as the  turn indicator, but its gimbals frame is angled upward about   $30^{\circ}$   from the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  [Figure 5-34] This allows it to sense both roll and yaw. Therefore during  a turn, the indicator first shows the rate of banking and once  stabilized, the turn rate. Some turn coordinator gyros are  dual-powered and can be driven by either air or electricity.  

Rather than using a needle as an indicator, the gimbal moves  a dial that is the rear view of a symbolic aircraft. The bezel  of the instrument is marked to show wings-level flight and  bank angles for a standard rate turn.  [Figure 5-35]  

The inclinometer, similar to the one in a turn-and-slip  indicator, is called a coordination ball, which shows the  relationship between the bank angle and the rate of yaw. The  turn is coordinated when the ball is in the center, between the  marks. The aircraft is skidding when the ball rolls toward the  outside of the turn and is slipping when it moves toward the

inside of the turn. A turn coordinator does not sense pitch.  This is indicated on some instruments by placing the words  “NO PITCH INFORMATION” on the dial.  

# Flight Support Systems  

# Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)  

As aircraft displays have transitioned to new technology,  the sensors that feed them have also undergone significant  change. Traditional gyroscopic flight instruments have  been replaced by Attitude and Heading Reference Systems  (AHRS) improving reliability and thereby reducing cost and  maintenance.  

The function of an AHRS is the same as gyroscopic systems;  that is, to determine which way is level and which way is  north. By knowing the initial heading the AHRS can determine  both the attitude and magnetic heading of the aircraft.  

The genesis of this system was initiated by the development  of the ring-LASAR gyroscope developed by Kearfott located  in Little Falls, New Jersey.  [Figure 5-36]  Their development  of the Ring-LASAR gyroscope in the 1960s/1970s was  in support of Department of Defense (DOD) programs to  include cruise missile technology. With the precision of  these gyroscopes, it became readily apparent that they could  be leveraged for multiple tasks and functions. Gyroscopic  miniaturization has become so common that solid-state  gyroscopes are found in products from robotics to toys.  

Because the AHRS system replaces separate gyroscopes,  such as those associated with an attitude indicator, magnetic  heading indicator and turn indicator these individual systems  are no longer needed. As with many systems today, AHRS  itself had matured with time. Early AHRS systems used  expensive inertial sensors and flux valves. However, today the  AHRS for aviation and general aviation in particular are small  solid-state systems integrating a variety of technology such  as low cost inertial sensors, rate gyros, and magnetometers,  and have capability for satellite signal reception.  

# Air Data Computer (ADC)  

An Air Data Computer (ADC)  [Figure 5-37]  is an aircraft  computer that receives and processes pitot pressure, static  

![](images/52a609a3892831c77d06bc2776523bf530c891fa323873b5c29c9380a98e6f4a.jpg)

pressure, and temperature to calculate very precise altitude,  IAS, TAS, and air temperature. The ADC outputs this  information in a digital format that can be used by a variety  of aircraft systems including an EFIS. Modern ADCs are  small solid-state units. Increasingly, aircraft systems such as  autopilots, pressurization, and FMS utilize ADC information  for normal operations.  

NOTE: In most modern general aviation systems, both the  AHRS and ADC are integrated within the electronic displays  themselves thereby reducing the number of units, reducing  weight, and providing simplification for installation resulting  in reduced costs.  

# Analog Pictorial Displays  

# Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)  

The HSI is a direction indicator that uses the output from  a flux valve to drive the dial, which acts as the compass  card. This instrument, shown in  Figure 5-38 , combines the  magnetic compass with navigation signals and a glideslope.  This gives the pilot an indication of the location of the aircraft  with relationship to the chosen course.  

In  Figure 5-38 , the aircraft heading displayed on the rotating  azimuth card under the upper lubber line is North or   $360^{\circ}$  .  The course-indicating arrowhead shown is set to 020; the  tail indicates the reciprocal,  $200^{\circ}$  . The course deviation bar  operates with a VOR/Localizer (VOR/LOC) navigation  receiver to indicate left or right deviations from the course  selected with the course-indicating arrow, operating in the  same manner that the angular movement of a conventional  VOR/LOC needle indicates deviation from course.  

The desired course is selected by rotating the course-indicating  arrow in relation to the azimuth card by means of the course  select knob. This gives the pilot a pictorial presentation: the  fixed aircraft symbol and course deviation bar display the  

![](images/c7aa20fd9bcbb2d15fdf809f59c9437a0207612715e834573676b120f5b6ae47.jpg)

aircraft relative to the selected course, as though the pilot were  above the aircraft looking down. The TO/FROM indicator is  a triangular pointer. When the indicator points to the head of  the course arrow, it shows that the course selected, if properly  intercepted and flown, takes the aircraft to the selected facility.  When the indicator points to the tail of the course arrow, it  shows that the course selected, if properly intercepted and  flown, takes the aircraft directly away from the selected facility.  

The glideslope deviation pointer indicates the relation of  the aircraft to the glideslope. When the pointer is below the  center position, the aircraft is above the glideslope, and an  increased rate of descent is required. In most installations,  the azimuth card is a remote indicating compass driven by  a fluxgate; however, in few installations where a fluxgate is  not installed, or in emergency operation, the heading must  be checked against the magnetic compass occasionally and  reset with the course select knob.  

# Attitude Direction Indicator (ADI)  

Advances in attitude instrumentation combine the gyro  horizon with other instruments such as the HSI, thereby  reducing the number of separate instruments to which the  pilot must devote attention. The attitude direction indicator  (ADI) is an example of such technological advancement.  A flight director incorporates the ADI within its system,  which is further explained below (Flight Director System).  However, an ADI need not have command cues; however,  it is normally equipped with this feature.  

# Flight Director System (FDS)  

A Flight Director System (FDS) combines many instruments  into one display that provides an easily interpreted  understanding of the aircraft’s flightpath. The computed  solution furnishes the steering commands necessary to obtain  and hold a desired path.  

Major components of an FDS include an ADI, also called  a Flight Director Indicator (FDI), an HSI, a mode selector,  and a flight director computer. It should be noted that a flight  director in use does not infer the aircraft is being manipulated  by the autopilot (coupled), but is providing steering  commands that the pilot (or the autopilot, if coupled) follows.  

Typical flight directors use one of two display systems for  steerage. The first is a set of command bars, one horizontal  and one vertical. The command bars in this configuration  are maintained in a centered position (much like a centered  glideslope). The second uses a miniature aircraft aligned to  a command cue.  

A flight director displays steerage commands to the pilot on  the ADI. As previously mentioned, the flight director receives  its signals from one of various sources and provides that to the  ADI for steerage commands. The mode controller provides  signals through the ADI to drive the steering bars, e.g., the  pilot flies the aircraft to place the delta symbol in the V of the  steering bars. “Command” indicators tell the pilot in which  direction and how much to change aircraft attitude to achieve  the desired result.  

The computed command indications relieve the pilot of  many of the mental calculations required for instrument  flight. The yellow cue in the ADI  [Figure 5-39]  provides all  steering commands to the pilot. It is driven by a computer that  receives information from the navigation systems, the ADC,  AHRS, and other sources of data. The computer processes this  information, providing the pilot with a single cue to follow.  Following the cue provides the pilot with the necessary three- dimensional flight trajectory to maintain the desired path.  

One of the first widely used flight directors was developed  by Sperry and was called the Sperry Three Axis Attitude  Reference System (STARS). Developed in the 1960s, it was  commonly found on both commercial and business aircraft  alike. STARS (with a modification) and successive flight  directors were integrated with the autopilots and aircraft  providing a fully integrated flight system.  

The flight director/autopilot system described below is  typical of installations in many general aviation aircraft.  The components of a typical flight director include the mode  controller, ADI, HSI, and annunciator panel. These units are  illustrated in  Figure 5-40 .  

The pilot may choose from among many modes including  the HDG (heading) mode, the VOR/LOC (localizer tracking)  mode, or the AUTO Approach (APP) or G/S (automatic  capture and tracking of instrument landing system (ILS)  localizers and glidepath) mode. The auto mode has a fully

automatic pitch selection computer that takes into account  aircraft performance and wind conditions, and operates once  the pilot has reached the ILS glideslope. More sophisticated  systems allow more flight director modes.  

# Integrated Flight Control System  

The integrated flight control system integrates and merges  various systems into a system operated and controlled by one  principal component.  Figure 5-41  illustrates key components  of the flight control system that was developed from the  onset as a fully integrated system comprised of the airframe,  autopilot, and FDS. This trend of complete integration, once  seen only in large commercial aircraft, is now becoming  common in general aviation.  

# Autopilot Systems  

An autopilot is a mechanical means to control an aircraft  using electrical, hydraulic, or digital systems. Autopilots can  control three axes of the aircraft: roll, pitch, and yaw. Most  autopilots in general aviation control roll and pitch.  

Autopilots also function using different methods. The first  is position based. That is, the attitude gyro senses the degree  of difference from a position such as wings level, a change  in pitch, or a heading change.  

Determining whether a design is position based and/or rate  based lies primarily within the type of sensors used. In order  for an autopilot to possess the capability of controlling an  aircraft’s attitude (i.e., roll and pitch), that system must be  provided with constant information on the actual attitude  of that aircraft. This is accomplished by the use of several  different types of gyroscopic sensors. Some sensors are  designed to indicate the aircraft’s attitude in the form of  position in relation to the horizon, while others indicate rate  (position change over time).  

two of the aircraft’s three axes: movement about the vertical  axis (heading change or yaw) and about the longitudinal  axis (roll). This combined information from a single sensor  is made possible by the  $30^{\circ}$   offset in the gyro’s axis to the  longitudinal axis.  

Other systems use a combination of both position and rate- based information to benefit from the attributes of both systems  while newer autopilots are digital.  Figure 5-42  illustrates an  autopilot by Century.  

![](images/bb7545e0ad210cd2d49b92d4d0cda863d241a546fb9a20c9f595a2c32c852738.jpg)

# Flight Management Systems (FMS)  

In the mid-1970s, visionaries in the avionics industry such  as Hubert Naimer of Universal, and followed by others such  as Ed King, Jr., were looking to advance the technology of  aircraft navigation. As early as 1976, Naimer had a vision  of a “Master Navigation System” that would accept inputs  from a variety of different types of sensors on an aircraft  and automatically provide guidance throughout all phases  of flight.  

At that time aircraft navigated over relatively short distances  with radio systems, principally VOR or ADF. For long-range  flight inertial navigation systems (INS), Omega, Doppler,  and Loran were in common use. Short-range radio systems  usually did not provide area navigation (RNAV) capability.  Long-range systems were only capable of en route point- to-point navigation between manually entered waypoints  described as longitude and latitude coordinates, with typical  systems containing a limited number of waypoints.  

The laborious process of manually entering cryptic latitude  and longitude data for each flight waypoint created high  crew workloads and frequently resulted in incorrect data  entry. The requirement of a separate control panel for each  long-range system consumed precious flight deck space and  increased the complexity of interfacing the systems with  display instruments, flight directors, and autopilots.  

The concept employed a master computer interfaced with all  of the navigation sensors on the aircraft. A common control  display unit (CDU) interfaced with the master computer  would provide the pilot with a single control point for all  navigation systems, thereby reducing the number of required  flight deck panels. Management of the various individual  sensors would be transferred from the pilot to the new  computer.  

Since navigation sensors rarely agree exactly about position,  Naimer believed that blending all available sensor position  data through a highly sophisticated, mathematical filtering  system would produce a more accurate aircraft position. He  called the process output the “Best Computed Position.”  By using all available sensors to keep track of position, the  system could readily provide area navigation capability.  The master computer, not the individual sensors, would  be integrated into the airplane, greatly reducing wiring  complexity.  

To solve the problems of manual waypoint entry, a pre- loaded database of global navigation information would  be readily accessible by the pilot through the CDU. Using  such a system a pilot could quickly and accurately construct  a flight plan consisting of dozens of waypoints, avoiding  the tedious typing of data and the error potential of latitude/ longitude coordinates. Rather than simply navigating point- to-point, the master system would be able to maneuver the  aircraft, permitting use of the system for terminal procedures  including departures, arrivals, and approaches. The system  would be able to automate any aspect of manual pilot  navigation of the aircraft. When the first system, called the  UNS-1, was released by Universal in 1982, it was called a  flight management system (FMS).  [Figure 5-44]  

![](images/778012f3052eeed89df68597c03ddc37e2d29f85ac61f016b67368c9be56bb5a.jpg)  
Figure 5-44.   A Control Display Unit (CDU) used to control the  flight management system (FMS).  

An FMS uses an electronic database of worldwide  navigational data including navigation aids, airways and  intersections, Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs),  STARs, and Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) together  with pilot input through a CDU to create a flight plan. The  FMS provides outputs to several aircraft systems including  desired track, bearing and distance to the active waypoint,  lateral course deviation and related data to the flight guidance  system for the HSI displays, and roll steering command for  the autopilot/flight director system. This allows outputs from  the FMS to command the airplane where to go and when and  how to turn. To support adaptation to numerous aircraft types,  an FMS is usually capable of receiving and outputting both  analog and digital data and discrete information. Currently,  electronic navigation databases are updated every 28 days.  

The introduction of the Global Positioning System (GPS) has  provided extremely precise position at low cost, making GPS  the dominant FMS navigation sensor today. Currently, typical  FMS installations require that air data and heading information  be available electronically from the aircraft. This limits FMS  usage in smaller aircraft, but emerging technologies allow  this data from increasingly smaller and less costly systems. Some systems interface with a dedicated Distance Measuring  Equipment (DME) receiver channel under the control of the  FMS to provide an additional sensor. In these systems, the  FMS determines which DME sites should be interrogated  for distance information using aircraft position and the  navigation database to locate appropriate DME sites. The  FMS then compensates aircraft altitude and station altitude  with the aid of the database to determine the precise distance  to the station. With the distances from a number of sites the  FMS can compute a position nearly as accurately as GPS.  

Aimer visualized three-dimensional aircraft control with an  FMS. Modern systems provide Vertical Navigation (VNAV) as  well as Lateral Navigation (LNAV) allowing the pilot to create  a vertical flight profile synchronous with the lateral flight plan.  Unlike early systems, such as Inertial Reference Systems (IRS)  that were only suitable for en route navigation, the modern  FMS can guide an aircraft during instrument approaches.  

Today, an FMS provides not only real-time navigation  capability but typically interfaces with other aircraft systems  providing fuel management, control of cabin briefing and  display systems, display of uplinked text and graphic weather  data and air/ground data link communications.  

# Electronic Flight Instrument Systems  

Modern technology has introduced into aviation a new  method of displaying flight instruments, such as electronic  flight instrument systems, integrated flight deck displays, and  others. For the purpose of the practical test standards, any  flight instrument display that utilizes LCD or picture tube like  displays is referred to as “electronic flight instrument display”  and/or a glass flight deck. In general aviation there is typically  a primary flight display (PFD) and a multi-function display  (MFD). Although both displays are in many cases identical,  the PFD provides the pilot instrumentation necessary for  flight to include altitude, airspeed, vertical velocity, attitude,  heading and trim and trend information.  

Glass flight decks (a term coined to describe electronic flight  instrument systems) are becoming more widespread as cost  falls and dependability continually increases. These systems  provide many advantages such as being lighter, more reliable,  no moving parts to wear out, consuming less power, and  replacing numerous mechanical indicators with a single glass  display. Because the versatility offered by glass displays is  much greater than that offered by analog displays, the use of  such systems only increases with time until analog systems  are eclipsed.  

# Primary Flight Display (PFD)  

PFDs provide increased situational awareness (SA) to the  pilot by replacing the traditional six instruments used for  instrument flight with an easy-to-scan display that provides  the horizon, airspeed, altitude, vertical speed, trend, trim,  rate of turn among other key relevant indications. Examples  of PFDs are illustrated in  Figure 5-45 .  

# Synthetic Vision  

Synthetic vision provides a realistic depiction of the aircraft  in relation to terrain and flightpath. Systems such as those  produced by Chelton Flight Systems, Universal Flight  Systems, and others provide for depictions of terrain and  course.  Figure 5-46  is an example of the Chelton Flight  System providing both 5-dimensional situational awareness  and a synthetic highway in the sky, representing the desired  flightpath. Synthetic vision is used as a PFD, but provides  guidance in a more normal, outside reference format.  

# Multi-Function Display (MFD)  

In addition to a PFD directly in front of the pilot, an MFD  that provides the display of information in addition to primary  flight information is used within the flight deck.  [Figure 5-47] Information such as a moving map, approach charts, Terrain  Awareness Warning System, and weather depiction can all  be illustrated on the MFD. For additional redundancy both  the PFD and MFD can display all critical information that  the other normally presents thereby providing redundancy  (using a reversionary mode) not normally found in general  aviation flight decks.  

# Advanced Technology Systems  

# Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broadcast  (ADS-B)  

Although standards for Automatic Dependent Surveillance  (Broadcast) (ADS-B) are still under continuing development,  the concept is simple: aircraft broadcast a message on  a regular basis, which includes their position (such as  latitude, longitude and altitude), velocity, and possibly  other information. Other aircraft or systems can receive this  information for use in a wide variety of applications. The  

![](images/ca2adb6a064e7e07081acbc33aebee55f8df9d84b43c4819c062a9af7b472f97.jpg)  
Figure 5-46.   The benefits of realistic visualization imagery, as  illustrated by Synthetic Vision manufactured by Chelton Flight  Systems.  The system provides the pilot a realistic, real-time, three- dimensional depiction of the aircraft and its relation to terrain  around it.  

key to ADS-B is GPS, which provides three-dimensional  position of the aircraft.  

As an simplified example, consider air-traffic radar. The radar  measures the range and bearing of an aircraft. The bearing is  measured by the position of the rotating radar antenna when it  receives a reply to its interrogation from the aircraft, and the  range by the time it takes for the radar to receive the reply.  

An ADS-B based system, on the other hand, would listen  for position reports broadcast by the aircraft.  [Figure 5-48] These position reports are based on satellite navigation  systems. These transmissions include the transmitting  aircraft’s position, which the receiving aircraft processes into  

![](images/d2522cec6c905c1553a85929adb49be2473648b62ddf53b50764948cf7e4183f.jpg)

usable pilot information. The accuracy of the system is now  determined by the accuracy of the navigation system, not  measurement errors. Furthermore the accuracy is unaffected  by the range to the aircraft as in the case of radar. With radar,  detecting aircraft speed changes require tracking the data and  changes can only be detected over a period of several position  updates. With ADS-B, speed changes are broadcast almost  instantaneously and received by properly equipped aircraft.  Additionally, other information can be obtained by properly  equipped aircraft to include notices to airmen (NOTAM),  weather, etc.  [Figures 5-49  and  5-50]  At the present time,  ADS-B is predominantly available along the east coast of  the United States where it is matured.  

# Safety Systems  

# Radio Altimeters  

A radio altimeter, commonly referred to as a radar altimeter,  is a system used for accurately measuring and displaying the  height above the terrain directly beneath the aircraft. It sends  a signal to the ground and processes the timed information.  Its primary application is to provide accurate absolute altitude  information to the pilot during approach and landing. In  advanced aircraft today, the radar altimeter also provides its  information to other onboard systems such as the autopilot  and flight directors while they are in the glideslope capture  mode below 200-300 feet above ground level (AGL).  

A typical system consists of a receiver-transmitter (RT)  unit, antenna(s) for receiving and transmitting the signal,  and an indicator.  [Figure 5-51]  Category II and III precision  approach procedures require the use of a radar altimeter and  specify the exact minimum height above the terrain as a  decision height (DH) or radio altitude (RA).  

# Traffic Advisory Systems  Traffic Information System  

The Traffic Information Service (TIS) is a ground-based  service providing information to the flight deck via data  link using the S-mode transponder and altitude encoder. TIS  improves the safety and efficiency of “see and avoid” flight  through an automatic display that informs the pilot of nearby  traffic. The display can show location, direction, altitude  and the climb/descent trend of other transponder-equipped  aircraft. TIS provides estimated position, altitude, altitude

Figure 5-48.  Aircraft equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broadcast (ADS-B) continuously broadcast their identification,  altitude, direction, and vertical trend. The transmitted signal carries significant information for other aircraft and ground stations alike.  Other ADS-equipped aircraft receive this information and process it in a variety of ways. It is possible that in a saturated environment  (assuming all aircraft are ADS equipped), the systems can project tracks for their respective aircraft and retransmit to other aircraft  their projected tracks, thereby enhancing collision avoidance. At one time, there was an Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Addressed  (ADS-A) and that is explained in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.  

trend, and ground track information for up to several aircraft  simultaneously within about 7 NM horizontally, 3,500 feet  above and 3,500 feet below the aircraft.  [Figure 5-52]  This  data can be displayed on a variety of MFDs.  [Figure 5-53]  

Figure 5-54  displays the pictorial concept of the traffic  information system. Noteworthy is the requirement to have  Mode S and that the ground air traffic station processes the  Mode S signal.  

# Traffic Alert Systems  

Traffic alert systems receive transponder information from  nearby aircraft to help determine their relative position to the  equipped aircraft. They provide three-dimensional location  of other aircraft  [Figures 5-55, 5-56,  and  5-57]  and are cost  effective alternatives to TCAS equipage for smaller aircraft.  

# Traffic Avoidance Systems  

Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)  The TCAS is an airborne system developed by the FAA that  operates independently from the ground-based ATC system.  TCAS was designed to increase flight deck awareness of  proximate aircraft and to serve as a “last line of defense” for  the prevention of mid-air collisions.  

There are two levels of TCAS systems. TCAS I was developed  to accommodate the general aviation (GA) community and  the regional airlines. This system issues traffic advisories  (TAs) to assist pilots in visual acquisition of intruder aircraft.  TCAS I provides approximate bearing and relative altitude  of aircraft with a selectable range. It provides the pilot with  TA alerting him or her to potentially conflicting traffic. The  pilot then visually acquires the traffic and takes appropriate  action for collision avoidance.

TCAS II is a more sophisticated system which provides the  same information of TCAS I. It also analyzes the projected  flightpath of approaching aircraft and issues resolution  advisories to the pilot to resolve potential mid-air collisions.  Additionally, if communicating with another TCAS II  equipped aircraft, the two systems coordinate the resolution  alerts provided to their respective flight crews.  [Figure 5-58]

In this case, the pilot is requested to climb, with  $l,750$    feet being the appropriate rate of ascent to avoid traffic conflict.  This visual indication plus the audio warning provide the pilot with  excellent traffic awareness that augments see-and-avoid practices.  

# Terrain Alerting Systems  

# Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)  

An early application of technology to reduce controlled  flight into terrain (CFIT) was the GPWS. In airline use  since the early 1970s, GPWS uses the radio altimeter, speed,  and barometric altitude to determine the aircraft’s position  relative to the ground. The system uses this information in  determining aircraft clearance above the Earth and provides  limited predictability about aircraft position relative to rising  terrain. It does this based upon algorithms within the system  and developed by the manufacturer for different airplanes or  helicopters. However, in mountainous areas the system is  unable to provide predictive information due to the unusual  slope encountered.  

This inability to provide predictive information was evidenced  in 1999 when a DH-7 crashed in South America. The crew  had a GPWS onboard, but the sudden rise of the terrain  rendered it ineffective; the crew continued unintentionally  into a mountain with steep terrain. Another incident involved  Secretary of Commerce Brown who, along with all on board,  was lost when the crew flew over rapidly rising terrain where  the GPWS capability is offset by terrain gradient. However,  the GPWS is tied into and considers landing gear status, flap  position, and ILS glideslope deviation to detect unsafe aircraft  operation with respect to terrain, excessive descent rate,  excessive closure rate to terrain, unsafe terrain clearance while  not in a landing configuration, excessive deviation below an  ILS glideslope. It also provides advisory callouts.  

Generally, the GPWS is tied into the hot bus bar of the electrical  system to prevent inadvertent switch off. This was demonstrated  in an accident involving a large four-engine turboprop airplane.  While on final for landing with the landing gear inadvertently  up, the crew failed to heed the GPWS warning as the aircraft  crossed a large berm close to the threshold. In fact, the crew  attempted without success to shut the system down and attributed  the signal to a malfunction. Only after the mishap did the crew  realize the importance of the GPWS warning.  

# Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS)  

A TAWS uses GPS positioning and a database of terrain and  obstructions to provide true predictability of the upcoming  terrain and obstacles. The warnings it provides pilots are  both aural and visual, instructing the pilot to take specific  action. Because TAWS relies on GPS and a database of  terrain/obstacle information, predictability is based upon  aircraft location and projected location. The system is time  based and therefore compensates for the performance of the  aircraft and its speed.  [Figure 5-59]  

# Head-Up Display (HUD)  

The HUD is a display system that provides a projection of  navigation and air data (airspeed in relation to approach  reference speed, altitude, left/right and up/down glideslope)  on a transparent screen between the pilot and the windshield.  The concept of a HUD is to diminish the shift between  looking at the instrument panel and outside. Virtually any

information desired can be displayed on the HUD if it is  available in the aircraft’s flight computer. The display for  the HUD can be projected on a separate panel near the  windscreen or as shown in  Figure 5-60  on an eye piece. Other  information may be displayed, including a runway target in  relation to the nose of the aircraft, which allows the pilot to  see the information necessary to make the approach while  also being able to see out the windshield.  

# Required Navigation Instrument System  Inspection  

# Systems Preflight Procedures  

Inspecting the instrument system requires a relatively small  part of the total time required for preflight activities, but its  importance cannot be overemphasized. Before any flight  involving aircraft control by instrument reference, the pilot  should check all instruments and their sources of power for  proper operation.  

NOTE: The following procedures are appropriate for  conventional aircraft instrument systems. Aircraft equipped  with electronic instrument systems utilize different  procedures.  

# Before Engine Start  

1.	 Walk-around inspection: Check the condition of all  antennas and check the pitot tube for the presence  

of any obstructions and remove the cover. Check  the static ports to be sure they are free from dirt  and obstructions, and ensure there is nothing on the  structure near the ports that would disturb the air  flowing over them.  

2.	 Aircraft records: Confirm that the altimeter and static  system have been checked and found within approved  limits within the past 24 calendar months. Check the  replacement date for the emergency locator transmitter  (ELT) batteries noted in the maintenance record, and  be sure they have been replaced within this time  interval.  

3.	 Preflight paperwork: Check the Airport/Facility  Directory (A/FD) and all NOTAMs for the condition  and frequencies of all the navigation aid (NAVAIDs)  that are used on the flight. Handbooks, en route charts,  approach charts, computer and flight log should be  appropriate for the departure, en route, destination,  and alternate airports.  

4.	 Radio equipment: Switches OFF.  

5.	 Suction gauge: Proper markings as applicable if  electronic flight instrumentation is installed.  

6.	 ASI: Proper reading, as applicable. If electronic  flight instrumentation is installed, check emergency  instrument.  

![](images/e8d7e262fe5ab39ac639315ae6f330fbb05ca17f1816e64c2aff1fcd792e2c83.jpg)  
Figure 5-60.   A head-up display (HUD).  

7.	 Attitude indicator: Uncaged, if applicable. If electronic  flight instrumentation is installed, check emergency  system to include its battery as appropriate.

 8.	 Altimeter: Set the current altimeter setting and ensure  that the pointers indicate the elevation of the airport.

 9.	 VSI: Zero indication, as applicable (if electronic flight  instrumentation is installed).

 10.	 Heading indicator: Uncaged, if applicable.

 11.	 Turn coordinator: If applicable, miniature aircraft  level, ball approximately centered (level terrain). 

 12.	 Magnetic compass: Full of fluid and the correction  card is in place and current.

 13.	 Clock: Set to the correct time and running.

 14.	 Engine instruments: Proper markings and readings,  as applicable if electronic flight instrumentation is  installed.

 15.	 Deicing and anti-icing equipment: Check availability  and fluid quantity.

 16.	 Alternate static-source valve: Be sure it can be opened  if needed, and that it is fully closed.

 17.	 Pitot tube heater: Check by watching the ammeter  when it is turned on, or by using the method specified  in the POH/AFM.  

# After Engine Start  

1.	 When the master switch is turned on, listen to the  gyros as they spin up. Any hesitation or unusual noises  should be investigated before flight.

 2.	 Suction gauge or electrical indicators: Check the  source of power for the gyro instruments. The suction  developed should be appropriate for the instruments  in that particular aircraft. If the gyros are electrically  driven, check the generators and inverters for proper  operation.

 3.	 Magnetic compass: Check the card for freedom of  movement and confirm the bowl is full of fluid.  Determine compass accuracy by comparing the  indicated heading against a known heading (runway  heading) while the airplane is stopped or taxiing  straight. Remote indicating compasses should also be  checked against known headings. Note the compass  card correction for the takeoff runway heading.

 4.	 Heading indicator: Allow 5 minutes after starting  engines for the gyro to spin up. Before taxiing, or  while taxiing straight, set the heading indicator to  correspond with the magnetic compass heading. A  slaved gyrocompass should be checked for slaving  action and its indications compared with those of the  

magnetic compass. If an electronic flight instrument  system is installed, consult the flight manual for proper  procedures. 5.	 Attitude indicator: Allow the same time as noted  above for gyros to spin up. If the horizon bar erects  to the horizontal position and remains at the correct  position for the attitude of the airplane, or if it begins  to vibrate after this attitude is reached and then slowly  stops vibrating altogether, the instrument is operating  properly. If an electronic flight instrument system  is installed, consult the flight manual for proper  procedures. 6.	 Altimeter: With the altimeter set to the current reported  altimeter setting, note any variation between the  known field elevation and the altimeter indication. If  the indication is not within 75 feet of field elevation,  the accuracy of the altimeter is questionable and  the problem should be referred to a repair station  for evaluation and possible correction. Because the  elevation of the ramp or hangar area might differ  significantly from field elevation, recheck when in  the run-up area if the error exceeds 75 feet. When  no altimeter setting is available, set the altimeter  to the published field elevation during the preflight  instrument check. 7.	 VSI: The instrument should read zero. If it does not,  tap the panel gently. If an electronic flight instrument  system is installed, consult the flight manual for proper  procedures. 8.	 Engine instruments: Check for proper readings.  9.	 Radio equipment: Check for proper operation and set  as desired. 10.	 Deicing and anti-icing equipment: Check operation.  

# Taxiing and Takeoff  

Ensuring the functionality of the turn coordinator, heading  indicator, magnetic compass, and attitude indicator prior  to taxiing and takeoff is essential to flight safety. Runway  incursion is an incident at an airport that adversely affects  runway safety and pilots must mitigate this risk by ensuring  that all of the directional flight instruments are checked  properly before taxiing or taking off so that the position  of the aircraft in relation to the runway and other traffic is  always known.  

1.	 Turn coordinator: During taxi turns, check the  miniature aircraft for proper turn indications. The ball  or slip/skid should move freely. The ball or slip/skid  indicator should move opposite to the direction of  turns. The turn instrument should indicate the direction  of the turn. While taxiing straight, the miniature  aircraft (as appropriate) should be level.  

2.	 Heading indicator: Before takeoff, recheck the heading  indicator. If the magnetic compass and deviation card  are accurate, the heading indicator should show the  known taxiway or runway direction when the airplane  

is aligned with them (within  $5^{\circ}$  ). 3.	 Attitude indicator: If the horizon bar fails to remain  in the horizontal position during straight taxiing, or  tips in excess of  $5^{\circ}$   during taxi turns, the instrument is  unreliable. Adjust the miniature aircraft with reference  to the horizon bar for the particular airplane while on  the ground. For some tricycle-gear airplanes, a slightly  nose-low attitude on the ground gives a level flight  attitude at normal cruising speed.  

# Engine Shut Down  

When shutting down the engine, note any abnormal  instrument indications.  

# Chapter 6, Section I Airplane Attitude  Instrument Flying  

Using Analog Instrumentation  

# Introduction  

Attitude instrument flying is defined as the control of an  aircraft’s spatial position by using instruments rather than  outside visual references. Today’s aircraft come equipped  with analog and/or digital instruments. Analog instrument  systems are mechanical and operate with numbers  representing directly measurable quantities, such as a watch  with a sweep second hand. In contrast, digital instrument  systems are electronic and operate with numbers expressed  in digits. Although more manufacturers are providing aircraft  with digital instrumentation, analog instruments remain more  prevalent. This section acquaints the pilot with the use of  analog flight instruments.  

Any flight, regardless of the aircraft used or route flown,  consists of basic maneuvers. In visual flight, aircraft attitude  is controlled by using certain reference points on the  aircraft with relation to the natural horizon. In instrument  flight, the aircraft attitude is controlled by reference to  the flight instruments. Proper interpretation of the flight  instruments provides essentially the same information that  outside references do in visual flight. Once the role of each  instrument in establishing and maintaining a desired aircraft  attitude is learned, a pilot is better equipped to control the  aircraft in emergency situations involving failure of one or  more key instruments.  

# Learning Methods  

The two basic methods used for learning attitude instrument  flying are “control and performance” and “primary and  supporting.” Both methods utilize the same instruments and  responses for attitude control. They differ in their reliance on  the attitude indicator and interpretation of other instruments.  

# Attitude Instrument Flying Using the Control and  Performance Method  

Aircraft performance is achieved by controlling the aircraft  attitude and power. Aircraft attitude is the relationship  of both the aircraft’s pitch and roll axes in relation to the  Earth’s horizon. An aircraft is flown in instrument flight by  controlling the attitude and power, as necessary, to produce  both controlled and stabilized flight without reference to a  visible horizon. This overall process is known as the control  and performance method of attitude instrument flying.  Starting with basic instrument maneuvers, this process can  be applied through the use of control, performance, and  navigation instruments resulting in a smooth flight from  takeoff to landing.  

# Control Instruments  

The control instruments display immediate attitude and power  indications and are calibrated to permit those respective  adjustments in precise increments. In this discussion, the  term “power” is used in place of the more technically correct  term “thrust or drag relationship.” Control is determined  by reference to the attitude and power indicators. Power  indicators vary with aircraft and may include manifold  pressure, tachometers, fuel flow, etc.  [Figure 6-1]  

# Performance Instruments  

The performance instruments indicate the aircraft’s actual  performance. Performance is determined by reference to  the altimeter, airspeed, or vertical speed indicator (VSI).  [Figure 6-2]  

# Navigation Instruments  

The navigation instruments indicate the position of the aircraft  in relation to a selected navigation facility or fix. This group  of instruments includes various types of course indicators,  range indicators, glideslope indicators, and bearing pointers.  [Figure 6-3]  Newer aircraft with more technologically  advanced instrumentation provide blended information,  giving the pilot more accurate positional information.  

# Procedural Steps in Using Control and  Performance  

1.	 Establish an attitude and power setting on the  control instruments that results in the desired  performance. Known or computed attitude changes  and approximated power settings helps to reduce the  pilot’s workload.  

2.	 Trim (fine tune the control forces) until control  pressures are neutralized. Trimming for hands-off  flight is essential for smooth, precise aircraft control.

It allows a pilot to attend to other flight deck duties  with minimum deviation from the desired attitude.  

3.	 Cross-check the performance instruments to determine  if the established attitude or power setting is providing  the desired performance. The cross-check involves  both seeing and interpreting. If a deviation is noted,  determine the magnitude and direction of adjustment  required to achieve the desired performance.  

4.	 Adjust the attitude and/or power setting on the control  instruments as necessary.  

# Aircraft Control During Instrument Flight  

Attitude Control  

Proper control of aircraft attitude is the result of proper use  of the attitude indicator, knowledge of when to change the  attitude, and then smoothly changing the attitude a precise  amount. The attitude reference provides an immediate, direct,  and corresponding indication of any change in aircraft pitch  or bank attitude.  

# Pitch Control  

Changing the “pitch attitude” of the miniature aircraft or  fuselage dot by precise amounts in relation to the horizon  makes pitch changes. These changes are measured in degrees,  or fractions thereof, or bar widths depending upon the type of  attitude reference. The amount of deviation from the desired  performance determines the magnitude of the correction.  

# Bank Control  

Bank changes are made by changing the “bank attitude”  or bank pointers by precise amounts in relation to the bank  scale. The bank scale is normally graduated at  $0^{\circ}$  ,  $10^{\circ}$  ,  $20^{\circ}$   $30^{\circ}$  ,   $60^{\circ}$  , and  $90^{\circ}$   and is located at the top or bottom of the  attitude reference. Bank angle use normally approximates  the degrees to turn, not to exceed  $30^{\circ}$  .  

# Power Control  

Proper power control results from the ability to smoothly  establish or maintain desired airspeeds in coordination  with attitude changes. Power changes are made by throttle  adjustments and reference to the power indicators. Power  indicators are not affected by such factors as turbulence,  improper trim, or inadvertent control pressures. Therefore,  in most aircraft little attention is required to ensure the power  setting remains constant.  

Experience in an aircraft teaches a pilot approximately how  far to move the throttle to change the power a given amount.  Power changes are made primarily by throttle movement,  followed by an indicator cross-check to establish a more  precise setting. The key is to avoid fixating on the indicators  while setting the power. Knowledge of approximate power  settings for various flight configurations helps the pilot avoid  overcontrolling power.  

# Attitude Instrument Flying Using the Primary and  Supporting Method  

Another basic method for teaching attitude instrument flying  classifies the instruments as they relate to control function,  as well as aircraft performance. All maneuvers involve some  degree of motion about the lateral (pitch), longitudinal (bank/ roll), and vertical (yaw) axes. Attitude control is stressed in  this handbook in terms of pitch control, bank control, power  control, and trim control. Instruments are grouped as they  relate to control function and aircraft performance as pitch  control, bank control, power control, and trim.  

# Pitch Control  

Pitch control is controlling the rotation of the aircraft  about the lateral axis by movement of the elevators.  After interpreting the pitch attitude from the proper flight  instruments, exert control pressures to effect the desired pitch  attitude with reference to the horizon. These instruments  include the attitude indicator, altimeter, VSI, and airspeed  indicator.  [Figure 6-4]  The attitude indicator displays a  direct indication of the aircraft’s pitch attitude while the other  pitch attitude control instruments indirectly indicate the pitch  attitude of the aircraft.  

# Attitude Indicator  

The pitch attitude control of an aircraft controls the angular  relationship between the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and  the actual horizon. The attitude indicator gives a direct and  immediate indication of the pitch attitude of the aircraft. The  aircraft controls are used to position the miniature aircraft  in relation to the horizon bar or horizon line for any pitch  attitude required.  [Figure 6-5]  

![](images/da11093b6dde3d590d29767b9a47127d2e0351acc57b8d11d7b2e4a913eb25ba.jpg)  

![](images/4b80874dbe566e8ffbe92bed9916266380d5626f249acaae0cf9ba0d07a5e00e.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.  Attitude indicator.  

The miniature aircraft should be placed in the proper position  in relation to the horizon bar or horizon line before takeoff.  The aircraft operator’s manual explains this position. As soon  as practicable in level flight and at desired cruise airspeed,  the miniature aircraft should be moved to a position that  aligns its wings in front of the horizon bar or horizon line.  This adjustment can be made any time varying loads or other  conditions indicate a need. Otherwise, the position of the  miniature aircraft should not be changed for flight at other than  cruise speed. This is to make sure that the attitude indicator  displays a true picture of pitch attitude in all maneuvers.  

When using the attitude indicator in applying pitch attitude  corrections, control pressure should be extremely light.  Movement of the horizon bar above or below the miniature  aircraft of the attitude indicator in an airplane should not  exceed one-half the bar width.  [Figure 6-6]  If further change  is required, an additional correction of not more than one-half  horizon bar wide normally counteracts any deviation from  normal flight.  

![](images/39a6e9cfb3f085a028831e26f26aefc891069102a410f8764598b2cf8ae3b96f.jpg)  
Figure 6-6.  Pitch correction using the attitude indicator.  

# Altimeter  

If the aircraft is maintaining level flight, the altimeter  needles maintain a constant indication of altitude. If the  altimeter indicates a loss of altitude, the pitch attitude must  be adjusted upward to stop the descent. If the altimeter  indicates a gain in altitude, the pitch attitude must be  adjusted downward to stop the climb.  [Figure 6-7]  The  altimeter can also indicate the pitch attitude in a climb  or descent by how rapidly the needles move. A minor  adjustment in pitch attitude may be made to control the rate  at which altitude is gained or lost. Pitch attitude is used only  to correct small altitude changes caused by external forces,  such as turbulence or up and down drafts.  

![](images/5b18cca75e00ea73a7560a734cd651cf14c1d1ca8d4719f2874045a0dc347f42.jpg)  
Figure 6-7.  Pitch correction using the altimeter.  

Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

In flight at a constant altitude, the VSI (sometimes referred  to as vertical velocity indicator or rate-of-climb indicator)  remains at zero. If the needle moves above zero, the pitch  attitude must be adjusted downward to stop the climb and  return to level flight. Prompt adjustments to the changes in  the indications of the VSI can prevent any significant change  in altitude.  [Figure 6-8]  Turbulent air causes the needle to  fluctuate near zero. In such conditions, the average of the  

![](images/bb938fa1c9100c8a221454fba9898c15b022e17d54a74c2954c0959cd513d5fc.jpg)  
Figure 6-8.  Vertical speed indicator.  

fluctuations should be considered as the correct reading.  Reference to the altimeter helps in turbulent air because it is  not as sensitive as the VSI.  

Vertical speed is represented in feet per minute (fpm).  [Figure 6-8]  The face of the instrument is graduated with  numbers such as 1, 2, 3, etc. These represent thousands of feet  up or down in a minute. For instance, if the pointer is aligned  with .5 (  $\sqrt[1]{2}$   of a thousand or  $500\,\mathrm{fpm}$  ), the aircraft climbs 500  feet in one minute. The instrument is divided into two regions:  one for climbing (up) and one for descending (down).  

During turbulence, it is not uncommon to see large  fluctuations on the VSI. It is important to remember that small  corrections should be employed to avoid further exacerbating  a potentially divergent situation.  

Overcorrecting causes the aircraft to overshoot the desired  altitude; however, corrections should not be so small that  the return to altitude is unnecessarily prolonged. As a guide,  the pitch attitude should produce a rate of change on the VSI  about twice the size of the altitude deviation. For example,  if the aircraft is 100 feet off the desired altitude, a 200 fpm  rate of correction would be used.  

During climbs or descents, the VSI is used to change the altitude  at a desired rate. Pitch attitude and power adjustments are made  to maintain the desired rate of climb or descent on the VSI.  

When pressure is applied to the controls and the VSI shows  an excess of 200 fpm from that desired, overcontrolling is  indicated. For example, if attempting to regain lost altitude at  the rate of   $500~\mathrm{fpm}$  , a reading of more than 700 fpm would  indicate overcontrolling. Initial movement of the needle  indicates the trend of vertical movement. The time for the VSI  to reach its maximum point of deflection after a correction is  called lag. The lag is proportional to speed and magnitude of  pitch change. In an airplane, overcontrolling may be reduced  by relaxing pressure on the controls, allowing the pitch attitude  to neutralize. In some helicopters with servo-assisted controls,  no control pressures are apparent. In this case, overcontrolling  can be reduced by reference to the attitude indicator.  

Some aircraft are equipped with an instantaneous vertical  speed indicator (IVSI). The letters “IVSI” appear on the face  of the indicator. This instrument assists in interpretation by  instantaneously indicating the rate of climb or descent at a  given moment with little or no lag as displayed in a VSI.  

Occasionally, the VSI is slightly out of calibration and  indicates a gradual climb or descent when the aircraft is  in level flight. If readjustments cannot be accomplished,  the error in the indicator should be considered when the  instrument is used for pitch control. For example, an  improperly set VSI may indicate a descent of  $100\,\mathrm{fpm}$   when  the aircraft is in level flight. Any deviation from this reading  would indicate a change in pitch attitude.  

# Airspeed Indicator  

The airspeed indicator gives an indirect reading of the  pitch attitude. With a constant power setting and a constant  altitude, the aircraft is in level flight and airspeed remains  constant. If the airspeed increases, the pitch attitude has  lowered and should be raised.  [Figure 6-9]  If the airspeed  decreases, the pitch attitude has moved higher and should  be lowered.  [Figure 6-10]  A rapid change in airspeed  indicates a large change in pitch; a slow change in airspeed  indicates a small change in pitch. Although the airspeed  indicator is used as a pitch instrument, it may be used in  level flight for power control. Changes in pitch are reflected  immediately by a change in airspeed. There is very little  lag in the airspeed indicator.

Figure 6-10.  Pitch attitude has moved higher.  

Pitch Attitude Instrument Cross-Check  

The altimeter is an important instrument for indicating pitch  attitude in level flight except when used in conditions of  exceptionally strong vertical currents, such as thunderstorms.  With proper power settings, any of the pitch attitude  instruments can be used to hold reasonably level flight  attitude. However, only the altimeter gives the exact altitude  information. Regardless of which pitch attitude control  instrument indicates a need for a pitch attitude adjustment,  the attitude indicator, if available, should be used to make  the adjustment. Common errors in pitch attitude control are:  

•	 Overcontrolling; •	 Improperly using power; and •	 Failing to adequately cross-check the pitch attitude  instruments and take corrective action when pitch  attitude change is needed.  

appropriate instruments, exert the necessary pressures to  move the ailerons and roll the aircraft about the longitudinal  axis. As illustrated in  Figure 6-11 , these instruments include:  

• 	 Attitude indicator • 	 Heading indicator • 	 Magnetic compass • 	 Turn coordinator/turn-and-slip indicator  

# Attitude Indicator  

As previously discussed, the attitude indicator is the only  instrument that portrays both instantly and directly the actual  flight attitude and is the basic attitude reference.  

# Heading Indicator  

The heading indicator supplies the pertinent bank and heading  information and is considered a primary instrument for bank.  

# Magnetic Compass  

The magnetic compass provides heading information and is  considered a bank instrument when used with the heading  indicator. Care should be exercised when using the magnetic  compass as it is affected by acceleration, deceleration in  flight caused by turbulence, climbing, descending, power  changes, and airspeed adjustments. Additionally, the  magnetic compass indication will lead and lag in its reading  depending upon the direction of turn. As a result, acceptance  of its indication should be considered with other instruments  that indicate turn information. These include the already  mentioned attitude and heading indicators, as well as the  turn-and-slip indicator and turn coordinator.  

# Bank Control  

Bank control is controlling the angle made by the wing and  the horizon. After interpreting the bank attitude from the  

![](images/defc6b7e581cccc6cbbadaf892bf475e478b3ed7c3f6b3e8fbfafad88f9502bb.jpg)  

Turn Coordinator/Turn-and-Slip Indicator  

Both of these instruments provide turn information.  [Figure 6-12]  The turn coordinator provides both bank rate  and then turn rate once stabilized. The turn-and-slip indicator  provides only turn rate.  

![](images/1c4358ac8a34bb9ba34c84ad5c1534b3ff4214b6c39be70c1e440f3f80881fae.jpg)  
Figure 6-12.  Turn coordinator and turn-and-slip indicator.  

# Power Control  

A power change to adjust airspeed may cause movement  around some or all of the aircraft axes. The amount and  direction of movement depends on how much or how rapidly  the power is changed, whether single-engine or multiengine  airplane or helicopter. The effect on pitch attitude and  airspeed caused by power changes during level flight is  illustrated in  Figures 6-13  and  6-14 . During or immediately  after adjusting the power control(s), the power instruments  should be cross-checked to see if the power adjustment is  as desired. Whether or not the need for a power adjustment  is indicated by another instrument(s), adjustment is made  by cross-checking the power instruments. Aircraft are  powered by a variety of powerplants, each powerplant  having certain instruments that indicate the amount of power  being applied to operate the aircraft. During instrument  flight, these instruments must be used to make the required  power adjustments.  

As illustrated in  Figure 6-15,  power indicator instruments  include:  

• 	 Airspeed indicator • 	 Engine instruments  

# Airspeed Indicator  

The airspeed indicator provides an indication of power  best observed initially in level flight where the aircraft is in  balance and trim. If in level flight the airspeed is increasing,  it can generally be assumed that the power has increased,  necessitating the need to adjust power or re-trim the aircraft.  

# Engine Instruments  

Engine instruments, such as the manifold pressure (MP)  indicator, provide an indication of aircraft performance for a  given setting under stable conditions. If the power conditions  are changed, as reflected in the respective engine instrument  readings, there is an affect upon the aircraft performance,  either an increase or decrease of airspeed. When the propeller  rotational speed (revolutions per minute (RPM) as viewed  on a tachometer) is increased or decreased on fixed-pitch  propellers, the performance of the aircraft reflects a gain or  loss of airspeed as well.  

# Trim Control  

Proper trim technique is essential for smooth and accurate  instrument flying and utilizes instrumentation illustrated in  Figure 6-16.  The aircraft should be properly trimmed while  executing a maneuver. The degree of flying skill, which  ultimately develops, depends largely upon how well the  aviator learns to keep the aircraft trimmed.  

# Airplane Trim  

An airplane is correctly trimmed when it is maintaining a  desired attitude with all control pressures neutralized. By  relieving all control pressures, it is much easier to maintain the

aircraft at a certain attitude. This allows more time to devote  to the navigation instruments and additional flight deck duties.  

An aircraft is placed in trim by:  

•	 Applying control pressure(s) to establish a desired  attitude. Then, the trim is adjusted so that the aircraft  maintains that attitude when flight controls are  released. The aircraft is trimmed for coordinated flight  by centering the ball of the turn-and-slip indicator.  •	 Moving the rudder trim in the direction where the  ball is displaced from center. Aileron trim may then  be adjusted to maintain a wings-level attitude.  •	 Using balanced power or thrust when possible to aid  in maintaining coordinated flight. Changes in attitude,  power, or configuration may require trim adjustments.  Use of trim alone to establish a change in aircraft  attitude usually results in erratic aircraft control.  Smooth and precise attitude changes are best attained  by a combination of control pressures and subsequent  trim adjustments. The trim controls are aids to smooth  aircraft control.  

# Helicopter Trim  

A helicopter is placed in trim by continually cross-checking  the instruments and performing the following:  

•	 Using the cyclic-centering button. If the helicopter is  so equipped, this relieves all possible cyclic pressures.  •	 Using the pedal adjustment to center the ball of the  turn indicator. Pedal trim is required during all power  changes and is used to relieve all control pressures  held after a desired attitude has been attained.  

An improperly trimmed helicopter requires constant control  pressures, produces tension, distracts attention from cross- checking, and contributes to abrupt and erratic attitude  control. The pressures felt on the controls should be only  those applied while controlling the helicopter.  

Adjust the pitch attitude, as airspeed changes, to maintain  desired attitude for the maneuver being executed. The bank  must be adjusted to maintain a desired rate of turn, and the  pedals must be used to maintain coordinated flight. Trim must  be adjusted as control pressures indicate a change is needed.  

# Example of Primary and Support Instruments  

Straight-and-level flight at a constant airspeed means that an  exact altitude is to be maintained with zero bank (constant  heading). The primary pitch, bank, and power instruments  used to maintain this flight condition are:  

•	 Altimeter—supplies the most pertinent altitude  information and is primary for pitch.  

•	 Heading Indicator—supplies the most pertinent bank  or heading information and is primary for bank.   •	 Airspeed Indicator—supplies the most pertinent  information concerning performance in level flight  in terms of power output and is primary for power.  

Although the attitude indicator is the basic attitude reference,  the concept of primary and supporting instruments does not  devalue any particular flight instrument, when available, in  establishing and maintaining pitch-and-bank attitudes. It is the  only instrument that instantly and directly portrays the actual  flight attitude. It should always be used, when available, in  establishing and maintaining pitch-and-bank attitudes. The  specific use of primary and supporting instruments during  basic instrument maneuvers is presented in more detail in  Chapter 7, Airplane Basic Flight Maneuvers.  

# Fundamental Skills  

During attitude instrument training, two fundamental flight  skills must be developed. They are instrument cross-check  and instrument interpretation, both resulting in positive  aircraft control. Although these skills are learned separately  and in deliberate sequence, a measure of proficiency in  precision flying is the ability to integrate these skills into  unified, smooth, positive control responses to maintain any  prescribed flightpath.  

# Instrument Cross-Check  

The first fundamental skill is cross-checking (also called  “scanning” or “instrument coverage”). Cross-checking is the  continuous and logical observation of instruments for attitude  and performance information. In attitude instrument flying,  the pilot maintains an attitude by reference to instruments,  producing the desired result in performance. Observing and  interpreting two or more instruments to determine attitude and  performance of an aircraft is called cross-checking. Although  no specific method of cross-checking is recommended, those  instruments that give the best information for controlling the  aircraft in any given maneuver should be used. The important  instruments are the ones that give the most pertinent  information for any particular phase of the maneuver. These  are usually the instruments that should be held at a constant  indication. The remaining instruments should help maintain  the important instruments at the desired indications, which  is also true in using the emergency panel.  

Cross-checking is mandatory in instrument flying. In  visual flight, a level attitude can be maintained by outside  references. However, even then the altimeter must be checked  to determine if altitude is being maintained. Due to human  error, instrument error, and airplane performance differences  in various atmospheric and loading conditions, it is impossible  to establish an attitude and have performance remain constant  for a long period of time. These variables make it necessary  for the pilot to constantly check the instruments and make  appropriate changes in airplane attitude using cross-checking  of instruments. Examples of cross-checking are explained in  the following paragraphs.  

# Selected Radial Cross-Check  

When the selected radial cross-check is used, a pilot spends  80 to 90 percent of flight time looking at the attitude indicator,  taking only quick glances at the other flight instruments (for  this discussion, the five instruments surrounding the attitude  indicator are called the flight instruments). With this method,  the pilot’s eyes never travel directly between the flight  instruments but move by way of the attitude indicator. The  maneuver being performed determines which instruments to  look at in the pattern.  [Figure 6-17]  

# Inverted-V Cross-Check  

In the inverted-V cross-check, the pilot scans from the  attitude indicator down to the turn coordinator, up to the  attitude indicator, down to the VSI, and back up to the attitude  indicator.  [Figure 6-18]  

# Rectangular Cross-Check  

In the rectangular cross-check, the pilot scans across  the top three instruments (airspeed indicator, attitude  indicator, and altimeter), and then drops down to scan  the bottom three instruments (VSI, heading indicator, and  turn instrument). This scan follows a rectangular path  (clockwise or counterclockwise rotation is a personal  choice).  [Figure 6-19]  

This cross-checking method gives equal weight to the  information from each instrument, regardless of its  importance to the maneuver being performed. However, this  method lengthens the time it takes to return to an instrument  critical to the successful completion of the maneuver.  

# Common Cross-Check Errors  

A beginner might cross-check rapidly, looking at the  instruments without knowing exactly what to look for. With  increasing experience in basic instrument maneuvers and  familiarity with the instrument indications associated with  them, a pilot learns what to look for, when to look for it,  and what response to make. As proficiency increases, a pilot  cross-checks primarily from habit, suiting scanning rate and  sequence to the demands of the flight situation. Failure to  maintain basic instrument proficiency through practice can  result in many of the following common scanning errors,  both during training and at any subsequent time.  

Fixation, or staring at a single instrument, usually occurs for  a reason, but has poor results. For example, a pilot may stare  

![](images/1c1d647b4c04a12dcdd1fea89c48272c6ad63d1e1f8d9d92a563f6fe50b03275.jpg)

at the altimeter reading 200 feet below the assigned altitude,  and wonder how the needle got there. While fixated on the  instrument, increasing tension may be unconsciously exerted  on the controls, which leads to an unnoticed heading change  that leads to more errors. Another common fixation is likely  when initiating an attitude change. For example, a shallow  bank is established for a  $90^{\circ}$   turn and, instead of maintaining  a cross-check of other pertinent instruments, the pilot stares at  the heading indicator throughout the turn. Since the aircraft is  turning, there is no need to recheck the heading indicator for  approximately 25 seconds after turn entry. The problem here  may not be entirely due to cross-check error. It may be related  to difficulties with instrument interpretation. Uncertainty  about reading the heading indicator (interpretation) or  uncertainty because of inconsistency in rolling out of turns  (control) may cause the fixation.  

Omission of an instrument from a cross-check is another  likely fault. It may be caused by failure to anticipate  significant instrument indications following attitude  changes. For example, in a roll-out from a   $180^{\circ}$   steep turn,  straight-and-level flight is established with reference only  to the attitude indicator, and the pilot neglects to check the  heading indicator for constant heading information. Because  of precession error, the attitude indicator temporarily shows  a slight error, correctable by quick reference to the other  flight instruments.  

Emphasis on a single instrument, instead of on the combination  of instruments necessary for attitude information, is an  understandable fault during the initial stages of training. It  is a natural tendency to rely on the instrument that is most  readily understood, even when it provides erroneous or  inadequate information. Reliance on a single instrument is  poor technique. For example, a pilot can maintain reasonably  close altitude control with the attitude indicator, but cannot  hold altitude with precision without including the altimeter  in the cross-check.  

# Instrument Interpretation  

The second fundamental skill, instrument interpretation,  requires more thorough study and analysis. It begins by  understanding each instrument’s construction and operating  principles. Then, this knowledge must be applied to the  performance of the aircraft being flown, the particular  maneuvers to be executed, the cross-check and control  techniques applicable to that aircraft, and the flight conditions.  

For example, a pilot uses full power in a small airplane for a  5-minute climb from near sea level, and the attitude indicator  shows the miniature aircraft two bar widths (twice the  thickness of the miniature aircraft wings) above the artificial  horizon.  [Figure 6-20]  The airplane is climbing at 500 fpm  as shown on the VSI, and at airspeed of 90 knots, as shown  on the airspeed indicator. With the power available in this  particular airplane and the attitude selected by the pilot, the  performance is shown on the instruments. Now, set up the  identical picture on the attitude indicator in a jet airplane.  With the same airplane attitude as shown in the first example,  the VSI in the jet reads  $2{,}000\,\mathrm{fpm}$   and the airspeed indicator  reads 250 knots.  

![](images/8ff23bd23b2b707011604726d1fe06e499f4c68ba1982716d54b44951d62ff7a.jpg)  
Figure 6-20.  Power and attitude equal performance.  

As the performance capabilities of the aircraft are learned,  a pilot interprets the instrument indications appropriately  in terms of the attitude of the aircraft. If the pitch attitude  is to be determined, the airspeed indicator, altimeter, VSI,  and attitude indicator provide the necessary information. If  the bank attitude is to be determined, the heading indicator,  turn coordinator, and attitude indicator must be interpreted.  For each maneuver, learn what performance to expect and  the combination of instruments to be interpreted in order  to control aircraft attitude during the maneuver. It is the  two fundamental flight skills, instrument cross-check and  instrument interpretation, that provide the smooth and  seamless control necessary for basic instrument flight as  discussed at the beginning of the chapter.  

# Chapter 6, Section II Airplane Attitude  Instrument Flying  

Using an Electronic Flight Display  

# Introduction  

Attitude instrument flying is defined as the control of an  aircraft’s spatial position by using instruments rather than  outside visual references. As noted in Section I, today’s  aircraft come equipped with analog and/or digital instruments.  Section II acquaints the pilot with the use of digital instruments  known as an electronic flight display (EFD).  

The improvements in avionics coupled with the introduction  of EFDs to general aviation aircraft offer today’s pilot an  unprecedented array of accurate instrumentation to use in  the support of instrument flying.  

Until recently, most general aviation aircraft were equipped  with individual instruments utilized collectively to safely  maneuver the aircraft by instrument reference alone. With  the release of the EFD system, the conventional instruments  have been replaced by multiple liquid crystal display (LCD)  screens. The first screen is installed in front of the left seat  pilot position and is referred to as the primary flight display  (PFD).  [Figure 6-21]  The second screen is positioned in  approximately the center of the instrument panel and is  referred to as the multifunction display (MFD).  [Figure 6-22]   The pilot can use the MFD to display navigation information  (moving maps), aircraft systems information (engine  monitoring), or should the need arise, a PFD.  [Figure 6-23]   With just these two screens, aircraft designers have been able  to declutter instrument panels while increasing safety. This  has been accomplished through the utilization of solid-state  instruments that have a failure rate far lower than those of  conventional analog instrumentation.  

However, in the event of electrical failure, the pilot still  has emergency instruments as a backup. These instruments  either do not require electrical power, or as in the case  of many attitude indicators, they are battery equipped.  [Figure 6-24]  

Pilots flying under visual flight rules (VFR) maneuver their  aircraft by reference to the natural horizon, utilizing specific  reference points on the aircraft. In order to operate the aircraft  in other than VFR weather, with no visual reference to the  natural horizon, pilots need to develop additional skills.  These skills come from the ability to maneuver the aircraft by  reference to flight instruments alone. These flight instruments  replicate all the same key elements that a VFR pilot utilizes  during a normal flight. The natural horizon is replicated on  the attitude indicator by the artificial horizon.  

Understanding how each flight instrument operates and  what role it plays in controlling the attitude of the aircraft  is fundamental in learning attitude instrument flying. When  the pilot understands how all the instruments are used in  establishing and maintaining a desired aircraft attitude, the  pilot is better prepared to control the aircraft should one  or more key instruments fail or if the pilot should enter  instrument flight conditions.  

# Learning Methods  

There are two basic methods utilized for learning attitude  instrument flying. They are “control and performance” and  “primary and supporting.” These methods rely on the same  flight instruments and require the pilot to make the same  adjustments to the flight and power controls to control aircraft  attitude. The main difference between the two methods is the  importance that is placed on the attitude indicator and the  interpretation of the other flight instruments.

# Control and Performance Method  

Aircraft performance is accomplished by controlling the  aircraft attitude and power output. Aircraft attitude is the  relationship of its longitudinal and lateral axes to the Earth’s  horizon. When flying in instrument flight conditions, the  pilot controls the attitude of the aircraft by referencing the  flight instruments and manipulating the power output of the  engine to achieve the performance desired. This method can  be used to achieve a specific performance level enabling a  pilot to perform any basic instrument maneuver.  

The instrumentation can be broken up into three different  categories: control, performance, and navigation.  

# Control Instruments  

The control instruments depict immediate attitude and power  changes. The instrument for attitude display is the attitude  indicator. Power changes are directly reflected on the manifold  pressure gauge and the tachometer.  [Figure  $_{6-25J}$    All three  of these instruments can reflect small adjustments, allowing  for precise control of aircraft attitude.  

![](images/6cc63135ddd2a42a714c77177aed4c2c05dd3c08c24a72f812205bf1672e3a46.jpg)  
Figure 6-25.  Control instruments.  

In addition, the configuration of the power indicators installed  in each aircraft may vary to include the following types of  power indicators: tachometers, manifold pressure indicator,  engine pressure ratio indicator, fuel flow gauges, etc.  

The control instruments do not indicate how fast the aircraft  is flying or at what altitude it is flying. In order to determine  these variables and others, a pilot needs to refer to the  performance instruments.  

# Performance Instruments  

The performance instruments directly reflect the performance  the aircraft is achieving. The speed of the aircraft can be  referenced on the airspeed indicator. The altitude can be  referenced on the altimeter. The aircraft’s climb performance  can be determined by referencing the vertical speed indicator  (VSI).  [Figure 6-26]  Other performance instruments  available are the heading indicator, pitch attitude indicator,  and the slip/skid indicator.  

The performance instruments most directly reflect a change  in acceleration, which is defined as change in velocity  or direction. Therefore, these instruments indicate if the  aircraft is changing airspeed, altitude, or heading, which are  horizontal, vertical, or lateral vectors.  

# Navigation Instruments  

The navigation instruments are comprised of global  positioning system (GPS) displays and indicators, very high  frequency omnidirectional range/nondirectional radio beacon  (VOR/NDB) indicators, moving map displays, localizer, and  glideslope (GS) indicators.  [Figure 6-27]  The instruments  indicate the position of the aircraft relative to a selected  navigation facility or fix. Navigation instruments allow  the pilot to maneuver the aircraft along a predetermined  path of ground-based or spaced-based navigation signals  without reference to any external visual cues. The navigation  instruments can support both lateral and visual inputs.  

# The Four-Step Process Used to Change Attitude  

In order to change the attitude of the aircraft, the pilot must  make the proper changes to the pitch, bank, or power settings  of the aircraft. Four steps (establish, trim, cross-check, and  adjust) have been developed in order to aid in the process.  

# Establish  

Any time the attitude of the aircraft requires changing, the  pilot must adjust the pitch and/or bank in conjunction with  power to establish the desired performance. The changes  in pitch and bank require the pilot to reference the attitude  indicator in order to make precise changes. Power changes  should be verified on the tachometer, manifold pressure  gauge, etc. To ease the workload, the pilot should become

familiar with the approximate pitch and power changes  necessary to establish a specified attitude.  

# Trim  

Another important step in attitude instrument flying is  trimming the aircraft. Trim is utilized to eliminate the need  to apply force to the control yoke in order to maintain the  desired attitude. When the aircraft is trimmed appropriately,  the pilot is able to relax pressure on the control yoke and  momentarily divert attention to another task at hand without  deviating from the desired attitude. Trimming the aircraft is  very important, and poor trim is one of the most common  errors instructors note in instrument students.  

# Cross-Check  

Once the initial attitude changes have been made, the pilot  should verify the performance of the aircraft. Cross-checking  the control and performance instruments requires the pilot  to visually scan the instruments, as well as interpret the  indications. All the instruments must be utilized collectively  in order to develop a full understanding of the aircraft attitude.  During the cross-check, the pilot needs to determine the  magnitude of any deviations and determine how much of a  change is required. All changes are then made based on the  control instrument indications.  

# Adjust  

The final step in the process is adjusting for any deviations  that have been noted during the cross-check. Adjustments  should be made in small increments. The attitude indicator  and the power instruments are graduated in small increments  to allow for precise changes to be made. The pitch should be  made in reference to bar widths on the miniature airplane.  The bank angle can be changed in reference to the roll scale  and the power can be adjusted in reference to the tachometer,  manifold pressure gauge, etc.  

By utilizing these four steps, pilots can better manage the  attitude of their aircraft. One common error associated with  this process is making a larger than necessary change when  a deviation is noted. Pilots need to become familiar with the  aircraft and learn how great a change in attitude is needed to  produce the desired performance.  

# Applying the Four-Step Process  

In attitude instrument flight, the four-step process is used to  control pitch attitude, bank attitude, and power application of  the aircraft. The EFD displays indications precisely enough  that a pilot can apply control more accurately.  

# Pitch Control  

The pitch control is indicated on the attitude indicator,which  spans the full width of the PFD. Due to the increased size  of the display, minute changes in pitch can be made and  corrected. The pitch scale on the attitude indicator is graduated  in 5-degree increments that allow the pilot to make corrections  with precision to approximately   $\%$   degree. The miniature  airplane utilized to represent the aircraft in conventional  attitude indicators is replaced in glass panel displays by a  yellow chevron.  [Figure 6-28]  Representing the nose of the  aircraft, the point of the chevron affords the pilot a much  more precise indication of the degree of pitch and allows  the pilot to make small, precise changes should the desired  aircraft performance change. When the desired performance  is not being achieved, precise pitch changes should be made  by referencing the point of the yellow chevron.  

# Bank Control  

Precise bank control can be developed utilizing the roll  pointer in conjunction with the roll index displayed on the  attitude indicator. The roll index is sectioned by hash marks at   $0^{\circ}$  ,  $10^{\circ}$  ,  $20^{\circ}$  ,  $30^{\circ}$  ,  $45^{\circ}$  ,  $60^{\circ}$   and the horizon line, which depicts   $90^{\circ}$   of bank.  [Figure 6-29]  The addition of the  $45^{\circ}$   hash mark  is an improvement over conventional attitude indicators.  

![](images/8cd8e32e3f8319f6cc9bc778440dd6f90b7ce473d4be0099b504d548cb30f588.jpg)

Figure 6-29.  Bank indicator index lines.  

In addition to the roll index, the instrument pilot utilizes  the turn rate indicator to maintain the aircraft in a standard  rate turn (  $3^{\circ}$   per second). Most instrument maneuvers can  be done comfortably, safely, and efficiently by utilizing a  standard rate turn.  

# Power Control  

The power instruments indicate how much power is being  generated by the engine. They are not affected by turbulence,  improper trim, or control pressures. All changes in power  should be made with reference to power instruments and  cross-checked on performance instruments.  

Power control needs to be learned from the beginning of  flight training. Attitude instrument flying demands increased  precision when it comes to power control. As experience  increases, pilots begin to know approximately how much  change in throttle position is required to produce the desired  change in airspeed. Different aircraft demand differing  amounts of throttle change to produce specific performance.  It is imperative that the pilot make the specific changes on the  power instruments and allow the performance to stabilize.  Avoid the tendency to overcontrol.  

One common error encountered with glass panel displays  is associated with the precision of the digital readouts.  This precision causes pilots to focus too much attention on  establishing the exact power setting.  

Control and power instruments are the foundation for precise  attitude instrument flying. The keys to attitude instrument  flying are establishing the desired aircraft attitude on the  attitude indicator and selecting the desired engine output on  the power instruments. Cross-checking is the vital ingredient  in maintaining precise attitude instrument flight.  

# Attitude Instrument Flying—Primary and  Supporting Method  

The second method for performing attitude instrument  flight is a direct extension of the control/power method.  By utilizing the primary and supporting flight instruments  in conjunction with the control and power instruments, the  pilot can precisely maintain aircraft attitude. This method  utilizes the same instruments as the control/power method;  however, it focuses more on the instruments that depict the  most accurate indication for the aspect of the aircraft attitude  being controlled. The four key elements (pitch, bank, roll,  and trim) are discussed in detail.  

Similar to the control/power method, all changes to aircraft  attitude need to be made using the attitude indicator and the  power instruments (tachometer, manifold pressure gauge,  etc.). The following explains how each component of the  aircraft attitude is monitored for performance.  

# Pitch Control  

The pitch of the aircraft refers to the angle between the  longitudinal axis of the aircraft and the natural horizon. When  flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), the  natural horizon is unavailable for reference and an artificial  horizon is utilized in its place.  [Figure 6-30]  The only  instrument capable of depicting the aircraft attitude is the  attitude indicator displayed on the PFD. The attitude and  heading reference system (AHRS) is the engine that drives  the attitude display. The AHRS unit is capable of precisely  tracking minute changes in the pitch, bank, and yaw axes,  thereby making the PFD very accurate and reliable. The  AHRS unit determines the angle between the aircraft’s  longitudinal axis and the horizon line on initialization. There  is no need or means for the pilot to adjust the position of the  yellow chevron, which represents the nose of the aircraft.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

In straight-and-level flight, the pilot maintains a constant  altitude, airspeed and, for the most part, heading for extended  periods of time. To achieve this, the three primary instruments  that need to be referenced in order to maintain these three  variables are the altitude, airspeed, and heading indicators.  

# Primary Pitch  

When the pilot is maintaining a constant altitude, the primary  instrument for pitch is the altimeter. As long as the aircraft  maintains a constant airspeed and pitch attitude, the altitude  should remain constant.  

Two factors that cause the altitude to deviate are turbulence  and momentary distractions. When a deviation occurs, a  change in the pitch needs to be made on the attitude indicator.  Small deviations require small corrections, while large  deviations require larger corrections. Pilots should avoid  making large corrections that result in rapid attitude changes,  for this may lead to spatial disorientation. Smooth, timely  corrections should be made to bring the aircraft back to the  desired attitude.  

Pay close attention to indications on the PFD. An increase  in pitch of  $2.5^{\circ}$   produces a climb rate of 450 feet per minute  (fpm). Small deviations do not require large attitude changes.  A rule of thumb for correcting altitude deviations is to  establish a change rate of twice the altitude deviation, not to  exceed   $500~\mathrm{fpm}$  . For example, if the aircraft is off altitude  by 40 feet,   $2\times40=80$   feet, so a descent of approximately  100 fpm allows the aircraft to return to the desired altitude  in a controlled, timely fashion.  

In addition to the primary instrument, there are also  supporting instruments that assist the pilot in cross-checking  the pitch attitude. The supporting instruments indicate trend,  but they do not indicate precise attitude indications. Three  instruments (vertical speed, airspeed, and altitude trend  tape) indicate when the pitch attitude has changed and that  the altitude is changing.  [Figure 6-31]  When the altitude is  constant, the VSI and altitude trend tape are not shown on  the PFD. When these two trend indicators are displayed, the

pilot is made aware that the pitch attitude of the aircraft has  changed and may need adjustment. Notice in  Figure 6-31 that the aircraft is descending at a rate of   $500\,\mathrm{fpm}$  .  

The instrument cross-check necessitates utilizing these  supporting instruments to better manage altitude control.  The VSI and trend tape provide the pilot with information  regarding the direction and rate of altitude deviations. The  pilot is thus able to make corrections to the pitch attitude  before a large deviation in altitude occurs. The airspeed  indicator depicts an increase if the pitch attitude is lowered.  Conversely, when the pitch attitude increases, the pilot should  note a decrease in the airspeed.  

# Primary Bank  

When flying in IMC, pilots maintain preplanned or assigned  headings. With this in mind, the primary instrument for bank  angle is the heading indicator. Heading changes are displayed  instantaneously. The heading indicator is the only instrument  that displays the current magnetic heading, provided that  it is matched to the magnetic compass with all deviation  adjustments accounted for.  [Figure 6-32]  

There are supporting instruments associated with bank as  well. The turn rate trend indicator shows the pilot when the  aircraft is changing heading. The magnetic compass is also  useful for maintaining a heading; however, it is influenced  by several errors in various phases of flight.  

# Primary Yaw  

The slip/skid indicator is the primary instrument for yaw.  It is the only instrument that can indicate if the aircraft is

moving through the air with the longitudinal axis of the  aircraft aligned with the relative wind.  

# Primary Power  

The primary power instrument for straight-and-level flight is  the airspeed indicator. The main focus of power is to maintain  a desired airspeed during level flight. No other instrument  delivers instantaneous indication.  

Learning the primary and supporting instruments for  each variable is the key to successfully mastering attitude  instrument flying. At no point does the primary and supporting  method devalue the importance of the attitude indicator or the  power instruments. All instruments (control, performance,  primary, and supporting) must be utilized collectively.  

# Fundamental Skills of Attitude Instrument  Flying  

When first learning attitude instrument flying, it is very  important that two major skills be mastered. Instrument cross- check and instrument interpretation comprise the foundation  for safely maneuvering the aircraft by reference to instruments  alone. Without mastering both skills, the pilot is not able to  maintain precise control of aircraft attitude.  

# Instrument Cross-Check  

The first fundamental skill is cross-checking (also call  “scanning”). Cross-checking is the continuous observation of  the indications on the control and performance instruments.  It is imperative that the new instrument pilot learn to  observe and interpret the various indications in order to  control the attitude and performance of the aircraft. Due to  the configuration of some glass panel displays, such as the  Garmin G1000, one or more of the performance instruments  may be located on an MFD installed to the right of the pilot’s  direct forward line of sight.  

How a pilot gathers the necessary information to control  the aircraft varies by individual pilot. No specific method of  cross-checking (scanning) is recommended; the pilot must  learn to determine which instruments give the most pertinent  information for any particular phase of a maneuver. With  practice, the pilot is able to observe the primary instruments  quickly and cross-check with the supporting instruments  in order to maintain the desired attitude. At no time during  instrument flying should the pilot stop cross-checking  the instrumentation.  

# Scanning Techniques  

Since most of the primary and supporting aircraft attitude  information is displayed on the PFD, standard scanning  techniques can be utilized. It is important to remember  to include the stand-by flight instruments as well as the  engine indications in the scan. Due to the size of the  attitude instrument display, scanning techniques have been  simplified because the attitude indicator is never out of  peripheral view.  

# Selected Radial Cross-Check  

The radial scan is designed so that your eyes remain on the  attitude indicator 80–90 percent of the time. The remainder  of the time is spent transitioning from the attitude indicator  to the various other flight instruments.  [Figure 6-33]  

The radial scan pattern works well for scanning the PFD. The  close proximity of the instrument tape displays necessitates  very little eye movement in order to focus in on the desired  instrument. While the eyes move in any direction, the  extended artificial horizon line allows the pilot to keep the  pitch attitude in his or her peripheral vision. This extended  horizon line greatly reduces the tendency to fixate on one  instrument and completely ignore all others. Because of  the size of the attitude display, some portion of the attitude  indicator is always visible while viewing another instrument  display on the PFD.  

# Starting the Scan  

Start the scan in the center of the PFD on the yellow chevron.  Note the pitch attitude and then transition the eyes upward to  the slip/skid indicator. Ensure that the aircraft is coordinated  by aligning the split triangle symbol. The top of the split  triangle is referred to as the roll pointer. The lower portion of  the split triangle is the slip/skid indicator. If the lower portion  of the triangle is off to one side, step on the rudder pedal on  the same side to offset it.  [Figure 6-34 NOTE: The aircraft  is not changing heading. There is no trend vector on the turn  rate indicator.]  

While scanning that region, check the roll pointer and assure  that the desired degree of roll is being indicated on the bank  scale. The roll index and the bank scale remain stationary at  the top of the attitude indicator. The index is marked with  angles of   $10^{\circ}$  ,   $20^{\circ}$  ,   $30^{\circ}$  ,  $45^{\circ}$  , and   $60^{\circ}$   in both directions. If  the desired bank angle is not indicated, make the appropriate  aileron corrections. Verify the bank angle is correct and  continue scanning back to the yellow chevron.  

Scan left to the airspeed tape and verify that the airspeed is  as desired, then return back to the center of the display. Scan  right to the altimeter tape. Verify that the desired altitude  is being maintained. If it is not, make the appropriate pitch  change and verify the result. Once the desired altitude has been  verified, return to the center of the display. Transition down to  the heading indicator to verify the desired heading. When the  heading has been confirmed, scan to the center of the display.

It is also important to include the engine indications in the  scan. Individualized scan methods may require adjustment  if engine indications are presented on a separate MFD. A  modified radial scan can be performed to incorporate these  instruments into the scan pattern. Another critical component  to include in the scan is the moving map display located on  the MFD. To aid in situational awareness and facilitate a  more centralized scan, a smaller inset map can be displayed  in the lower left corner of the PFD screen.  

# Trend Indicators  

One improvement the glass panel displays brought to the  general aviation industry is the trend vector. Trend vectors  are colored lines that appear on the airspeed and altitude  tapes, as well as on the turn rate indicator. The color of  the line may vary depending on the airplane manufacturer.  For example, on a Cirrus SR-20, the trend vector lines are  magenta and on the B-737 they are green. These colored lines  indicate what the associated airspeed, altitude, or heading  will be in 6 seconds for the Cirrus SR-20 and 10 seconds  for the B-737 if the current rate is maintained. The example  shown in  Figure 6-35  uses the color and data that represents  the trend vector for a Cirrus SR-20. The trend vector is not  displayed if there is no change to the associated tape and the  value remains constant  [Figure 6-36]  or if there is a failure  in some portion of the system that would preclude the vector  from being determined.  

![](images/5e06731209928ae2d97abeb55158b0de335fe71580c585568a788012cf741d9d.jpg)  
Figure 6-35.  Airspeed trend indicators.  

Trend vectors are a very good source of information for the  new instrument rated pilot(s). Pilots who utilize good scanning  techniques can pick up subtle deviations from desired  parameters and make small correction to the desired attitude.  KT  As soon as a trend is indicated on the PFD, a conscientious  pilot can adjust to regain the desired attitude.  [Figure 6-37]  

![](images/e1e9ddb34b95c64c4f11bc6f4c57f70e20986e6255cd0017ae8cff52ef3d31dc.jpg)

Figure 6-37.  Altimeter trend indicators.  

Another advancement in attitude instrument flying is the  turn rate trend indicator. As in the cases of airspeed, altitude,  3400  and vertical speed trend indicators, the turn rate trend  indicator depicts what the aircraft’s heading will be in 6  3300  seconds. While examining the top of the heading indicator,  notice two white lines on the exterior of the compass rose.  [Figure 6-38]  These two tick marks located on both sides  of the top of the heading indicator show half-standard rate  turns as well as standard rate turns.  3100  

In  Figure 6-39 , when the aircraft begins its turn to the left,  the magenta trend indicator elongates proportionally with the  rate of turn. To initiate a half-standard rate turn, position the

Figure 4-36.  

indicator on the first tick mark. A standard rate turn would  be indicated by the trend indicator extending to the second  tick mark. A turn rate in excess of standard rate would be  indicated by the trend indicator extending past the second tick  mark. This trend indicator shows what the aircraft’s heading  will be in 6 seconds, but is limited to indicate no more than   $24^{\circ}$   in front of the aircraft or  $4^{\circ}$   per second. When the aircraft  exceeds a turning rate of  $25^{\circ}$   in 6 seconds, the trend indicator  has an arrowhead attached to it.  

Trend indicators are very useful when leveling off at a specific  altitude, when rolling out on a heading, or when stabilizing  airspeed. One method of determining when to start to level  off from a climb or descent is to start leveling at 10 percent  of the vertical speed rate prior to the desired altitude.  

As the aircraft approaches the desired altitude, adjust the  pitch attitude to keep the trend indicator aligned with the  target altitude. As the target approaches, the trend indicator  gradually shrinks until altitude stabilizes. Trend indicators  should be used as a supplement, not as a primary means of  determining pitch change.  

# Common Errors Fixation  

Fixation, or staring at one instrument, is a common error  observed in pilots first learning to utilize trend indicators.  The pilot may initially fixate on the trend indicator and make  adjustments with reference to that alone. Trend indicators are  not the only tools to aid the pilot in maintaining the desired  power or attitude; they should be used in conjunction with the  primary and supporting instruments in order to better manage  the flight. With the introduction of airspeed tapes, the pilot  can monitor airspeed to within one knot. Fixation can lead  to attempting to keep the airspeed to an unnecessarily tight  tolerance. There is no need to hold airspeed to within one  knot; the Instrument Rating Practical Test Standards (PTS)  allows greater latitude.  

# Omission  

Another common error associated with attitude instrument  flying is omission of an instrument from the cross-check. Due  to the high reliability of the PFD and associated components,  pilots tend to omit the stand-by instruments as well as the  magnetic compass from their scans. An additional reason  for the omission is the position of the stand-by instruments.  Pilots should continue to monitor the stand-by instruments  in order to detect failures within those systems. One of the  most commonly omitted instruments from the scan is the  slip/skid indicator.  

# Emphasis  

In initial training, placing emphasis on a single instrument  is very common and can become a habit if not corrected.  When the importance of a single instrument is elevated above  another, the pilot begins to rely solely on that instrument  for guidance. When rolling out of a   $180^{\circ}$   turn, the attitude  indicator, heading indicator, slip/skid indicator, and altimeter  need to be referenced. If a pilot omits the slip/skid indicator,  coordination is sacrificed.  

# Chapter 7, Section I Airplane Basic  Flight Maneuvers  

Using Analog Instrumentation  

# Introduction  

Instrument flying techniques differ according to aircraft  type, class, performance capability, and instrumentation.  Therefore, the procedures and techniques that follow need  to be modified to suit individual aircraft. Recommended  procedures, performance data, operating limitations, and  flight characteristics of a particular aircraft are available in the  Pilot’s Operating Handbook/Airplane Flight Manual (POH/ AFM) for study before practicing the flight maneuvers.  

The flight maneuvers discussed in Chapter 7-I assume the  use of a single-engine, propeller-driven small airplane with  retractable gear and flaps and a panel with instruments  representative of those discussed earlier in Chapter 5, Flight  Instruments. With the exception of the instrument takeoff, all  of the maneuvers can be performed on “partial panel,” with  the attitude gyro and heading indicator covered or inoperative.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

# Pitch Control  

The pitch attitude of an airplane is the angle between the  longitudinal axis of the airplane and the actual horizon. In  level flight, the pitch attitude varies with airspeed and load.  For training purposes, the latter factor can normally be  disregarded in small airplanes. At a constant airspeed, there is  only one specific pitch attitude for level flight. At slow cruise  speeds, the level flight attitude is nose high with indications  as in  Figure 7-1 ; at fast cruise speeds, the level-flight attitude  is nose low.  [Figure 7-2]   Figure 7-3  shows the indications  for the attitude at normal cruise speeds. The instruments used  to determine the pitch attitude of the aircraft are the attitude  indicator, the altimeter, the vertical speed indicator (VSI),  and the airspeed indicator (ASI).  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator gives the direct indication of pitch  attitude. The desired pitch attitude is gained by using the  elevator control to raise or lower the miniature aircraft in  relation to the horizon bar. This corresponds to the way pitch  attitude is adjusted in visual flight by raising or lowering  the nose of the airplane in relation to the natural horizon.  However, unless the airspeed is constant, and until the  level flight attitude for that airspeed has been identified and  established, there is no way to know whether level flight as

indicated on the attitude indicator is resulting in level flight  as shown on the altimeter, VSI, and ASI. If the miniature  aircraft of the attitude indicator is properly adjusted on the  ground before takeoff, it shows approximately level flight at  normal cruise speed when the pilot completes the level off  from a climb. If further adjustment of the miniature aircraft  is necessary, the other pitch instruments must be used to  maintain level flight while the adjustment is made.  

To practice pitch control for level flight using only the  attitude indicator, use the following exercise. Restrict the  displacement of the horizon bar to a one-half bar width, a  bar width up or down, then a one-and-one-half bar width.  One-half, one, and one-and-one-half bar width nose-high  attitudes are shown in  Figures 7-4, 7-5,  and  7-6 .  

![](images/a10e1050e5ce59ae0329201f8176309d6f572e7f98941ab0fd4f3d383a4483ac.jpg)

Figure 7-5.  Pitch correction for level flight, one bar width.  

An instructor pilot can demonstrate these normal pitch  corrections and compare the indications on the attitude  indicator with the airplane’s position to the natural horizon.

Pitch attitude changes for corrections to level flight by  reference to instruments are much smaller than those  commonly used for visual flight. With the airplane correctly  trimmed for level flight, the elevator displacement and the  control pressures necessary to effect these standard pitch  changes are usually very slight. The following are a few  helpful hints to help determine how much elevator control  pressure is required.  

First, a tight grip on the controls makes it difficult to feel  control pressure changes. Relaxing and learning to control  the aircraft usually takes considerable conscious effort during  the early stages of instrument training.  

Second, make smooth and small pitch changes with positive  pressure. With practice, a pilot can make these small pitch  corrections up or down, “freezing” (holding constant) the  one-half, full, and one-and-one-half bar widths on the  attitude indicator.  

Third, with the airplane properly trimmed for level flight,  momentarily release all pressure on the elevator control  when becoming aware of tenseness. This is a reminder that  the airplane is stable; except under turbulent conditions, it  maintains level flight if left alone. Even when no control  change is called for, it is difficult to resist the impulse to  move the controls. This may be one of the most difficult  initial training problems in instrument flight.  

# Altimeter  

At constant power, any deviation from level flight (except  in turbulent air) is the result of a pitch change. Therefore,  the altimeter gives an indirect indication of the pitch attitude  in level flight, assuming constant power. Since the altitude  should remain constant when the airplane is in level flight,  any deviation from the desired altitude signals the need for a  pitch change. If the aircraft is gaining altitude, the nose must  be lowered.  [Figures 7-7  and  7-8]  

![](images/1b6f17af1ce618bf91226c0aac35a82dd17054698cc9c5b3cd1efaa392ea5346.jpg)

Figure 7-8.  Pitch correction following altitude increase—lower    attitude error.  nose to correct altitude error.  

The rate of movement of the altimeter needle is as important  as its direction of movement in maintaining level flight  without the use of the attitude indicator. An excessive pitch  deviation from level flight results in a relatively rapid change  of altitude; a slight pitch deviation causes a slow change.  Thus, if the altimeter needle moves rapidly clockwise, assume  a considerable nose-high deviation from level flight attitude.  Conversely, if the needle moves slowly counterclockwise to  indicate a slightly nose-low attitude, assume that the pitch  correction necessary to regain the desired altitude is small.  As the altimeter is added to the attitude indicator in a cross- check, a pilot learns to recognize the rate of movement of  the altimeter needle for a given pitch change as shown on  the attitude indicator.  

To practice precision control of pitch in an airplane without  an attitude indicator, make small pitch changes by visual  reference to the natural horizon and note the rate of movement  of the altimeter. Note what amount of pitch change gives  the slowest steady rate of change on the altimeter. Then  practice small pitch corrections by accurately interpreting  and controlling the rate of needle movement.  

An instructor pilot can demonstrate an excessive nose-down  deviation (indicated by rapid movement of the altimeter  needle) and then, as an example, show the result of improper  corrective technique. The normal impulse is to make a  large pitch correction in a hurry, but this inevitably leads  to overcontrolling. The needle slows down, then reverses  direction, and finally indicates an excessive nose-high  deviation. The result is tension on the controls, erratic control  response, and increasingly extreme control movements. The  correct technique, which is slower and smoother, returns the  airplane to the desired attitude more quickly, with positive  control and no confusion.  

When a pitch error is detected, corrective action should be  taken promptly, but with light control pressures and two  distinct changes of attitude: (1) a change of attitude to stop  the needle movement and (2) a change of attitude to return  to the desired altitude.  

When the altimeter indicates an altitude deviation, apply  just enough elevator pressure to decrease the rate of needle  movement. If it slows down abruptly, ease off some of the  pressure until the needle continues to move, but ease off  slowly. Slow needle movement means the airplane attitude  is close to level flight. Add slightly more corrective pressure  to stop the direction of needle movement. At this point, level  flight is achieved; a reversal of needle movement means  the aircraft has passed through it. Relax control pressures  carefully, continuing to cross-check since changing airspeed  causes changes in the effectiveness of a given control  pressure. Next, adjust the pitch attitude with elevator pressure  for the rate of change of altimeter needle movement that is  correlated with normal pitch corrections and return to the  desired altitude.  

As a rule of thumb, for errors of less than 100 feet, use a half  bar width correction.  [Figures 7-9  and  7-10]  For errors in  excess of 100 feet, use an initial full bar width correction.  [Figures 7-11  and  7-12]  Practice predetermined altitude  changes using the altimeter alone, then in combination with  the attitude indicator.  

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

The VSI, like the altimeter, gives an indirect indication of  pitch attitude and is both a trend and a rate instrument. As  a trend instrument, it shows immediately the initial vertical  movement of the airplane, which disregarding turbulence  can be considered a reflection of pitch change. To maintain  level flight, use the VSI in conjunction with the altimeter and  attitude indicator. Note any positive or negative trend of the  needle from zero and apply a very light corrective elevator

pressure. As the needle returns to zero, relax the corrective  pressure. If control pressures have been smooth and light, the  needle reacts immediately and slowly, and the altimeter shows  little or no change of altitude. As a rate instrument, the VSI  requires consideration of lag characteristics.  

Lag refers to the delay involved before the needle attains a  stable indication following a pitch change. Lag is directly  proportional to the speed and magnitude of a pitch change.  If a slow, smooth pitch change is initiated, the needle moves  with minimum lag to a point of deflection corresponding  to the extent of the pitch change, and then stabilizes as the  aerodynamic forces are balanced in the climb or descent.  A large and abrupt pitch change produces erratic needle  movement, a reverse indication, and introduces greater time  delay (lag) before the needle stabilizes. Pilots are cautioned  not to chase the needle when flight through turbulent  conditions produces erratic needle movements. The apparent  lag in airspeed indications with pitch changes varies greatly  among different airplanes and is due to the time required for  the airplane to accelerate or decelerate when the pitch attitude  is changed. There is no appreciable lag due to the construction  or operation of the instrument. Small pitch changes, smoothly  executed, result in an immediate change of airspeed.  

When using the VSI as a rate instrument and combining it  with the altimeter and attitude indicator to maintain level  flight, a pilot should know that the amount the altimeter  needle moves from the desired altitude governs the rate that  should be used to return to that altitude. A rule of thumb is to  make an attitude change that results in a vertical-speed rate  approximately double the error in altitude. For example, if  altitude is off by 100 feet, the rate of return to the desired  altitude should be approximately 200 feet per minute (fpm).  If it is off by more than 100 feet, the correction should  be correspondingly greater, but should never exceed the  optimum rate of climb or descent for the airplane at a given  airspeed and configuration.  

A deviation of more than 200 fpm from the desired rate  of return is considered overcontrolling. For example, if  attempting to change altitude by 200 feet, a rate in excess of  400 fpm indicates overcontrolling.  

When returning to an altitude, the VSI is the primary pitch  instrument. Occasionally, the VSI is slightly out of calibration  and may indicate a climb or descent when the airplane is in  level flight. If the instrument cannot be adjusted, take the  error into consideration when using it for pitch control. For  example, if the needle indicates a descent of  $200\,\mathrm{fpm}$   while  in level flight, use this indication as the zero position.  

# Airspeed Indicator (ASI)  

The ASI presents an indirect indication of the pitch attitude.  In non-turbulent conditions with a constant power setting and  pitch attitude, airspeed remains constant.  [Figure 7-13]  As the  pitch attitude lowers, airspeed increases, and the nose should  be raised.  [Figure 7-14]  As the pitch attitude rises, airspeed  decreases, and the nose should be lowered.  [Figure 7-15]  A  rapid change in airspeed indicates a large pitch change, and  a slow change of airspeed indicates a small pitch change.

Decreased Airspeed Increased Pitch  

Pitch control in level flight is a question of cross-check and  interpretation of the instrument panel for the instrument  information that enables a pilot to visualize and control  pitch attitude. Regardless of individual differences in  cross-check technique, all pilots should use the instruments  that give the best information for controlling the airplane  in any given maneuver. Pilots should also check the other  instruments to aid in maintaining the primary instruments  at the desired indication.  

As noted previously, the primary instrument is the one  that gives the most pertinent information for a particular  maneuver. It is usually the one that should be held at a  constant indication. Which instrument is primary for pitch  control in level flight, for example? This question should  be considered in the context of specific airplane, weather  conditions, pilot experience, operational conditions, and  other factors. Attitude changes must be detected and  interpreted instantly for immediate control action in high- performance airplanes. On the other hand, a reasonably  proficient instrument pilot in a slower airplane may rely  more on the altimeter for primary pitch information,  especially if it is determined that too much reliance on the  attitude indicator fails to provide the necessary precise  attitude information. Whether the pilot decides to regard  the altimeter or the attitude indicator as primary depends  on which approach will best help control the attitude. In  this handbook, the altimeter is normally considered as the  primary pitch instrument during level flight.  

# Bank Control  

The bank attitude of an airplane is the angle between the  airplane’s wings and the natural horizon. To maintain a  straight-and-level flightpath, the wings of the airplane are  kept level with the horizon (assuming the airplane is in  coordinated flight). The instruments used for bank control  are the attitude indicator, the heading indicator, and the  turn coordinator.  Figure 7-16  illustrates coordinated flight.  The aircraft is banked left with the attitude indicator and  turn coordinator indicating the bank. The heading indicator  indicates a left turn by apparent clockwise rotation of the  compass card behind the airplane silhouette.  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator shows any change in bank attitude  directly and instantly and is, therefore, a direct indicator. On  the standard attitude indicator, the angle of bank is shown  pictorially by the relationship of the miniature aircraft to the  artificial horizon bar and by the alignment of the pointer with  the banking scale at the top of the instrument. On the face of  the standard three-inch instrument, small angles of bank can  be difficult to detect by reference to the miniature aircraft,  especially if leaning to one side or changing a seating position

slightly. The position of the scale pointer is a good check  against the apparent miniature aircraft position. Disregarding  precession error, small deviations from straight coordinated  flight can be readily detected on the scale pointer. The  banking index may be graduated as shown in  Figure 7-17 ,  or it may be graduated in  $30^{\circ}$   increments.  

![](images/389d2ca382c0f63146602a97bf09e765e02dfc23e4f582854e79ad333d7d3a5e.jpg)  
Figure 7-17.  Bank interpretation with the attitude indicator.  

The instrument depicted in  Figure 7-17  has a scale pointer  that moves in the same direction of bank shown by the  miniature aircraft. In this case, the aircraft is in a left   $15^{\circ}$  bank. Precession errors in this instrument are common  and predictable, but the obvious advantage of the attitude  indicator is an immediate indication of both pitch attitude  and bank attitude in a single glance. Even with the precession  errors associated with many attitude indicators, the quick  attitude presentation requires less visual effort and time for  positive control than other flight instruments.  

# Heading Indicator  

The bank attitude of an aircraft in coordinated flight is shown  indirectly on the heading indicator, since banking results in  a turn and change in heading. Assuming the same airspeed  in both instances, a rapid movement of the heading indicator  (azimuth card in a directional gyro) indicates a large angle  of bank, whereas slow movement reflects a small angle of  bank. Note the rate of movement of the heading indicator  and compare it to the attitude indicator’s degrees of bank.  The attitude indicator’s precession error makes a precise  check of heading information necessary in order to maintain  straight flight.  

When deviations from straight flight are noted on the heading  indicator, correct to the desired heading using a bank angle no  greater than the number of degrees to be turned. In any case,  limit bank corrections to a bank angle no greater than that  required for a standard rate turn. Use of larger bank angles  requires a very high level of proficiency, and normally results  in overcontrolling and erratic bank control.  

# Turn Coordinator  

The miniature aircraft of the turn coordinator gives an  indirect indication of the bank attitude of the airplane.  When the miniature aircraft is level, the airplane is in  straight flight. When the miniature airplane is aligned with  one of the alignment marks and the aircraft is rolling to the  left or right the indication represents the roll rate, with the  alignment marks indicating a roll of 3 degrees per second  in the direction of the miniature aircraft. This can be seen  in level flight when a bank is introduced either to the left  or the right. The turn coordinator’s indicator will indicate  the rolling motion although there is no turn being made.  Conversely, a pedal input to the right or left causes the aircraft  to turn momentarily about its vertical axis (with no rolling  motion) with an indication of turn on the turn coordinator.  After the turn becomes stabilized and the aircraft is no  longer rolling, the turn coordinator displays the rate of turn  with the alignment marks equaling a turn of 3 degrees per  second. The turn coordinator is able to display both roll and  turn parameters because its electrically-powered gyroscope  is canted at an angle. As a result, the turn-and-slip indicator  provides both roll and turn indications. Autopilots in general  aviation today use this instrument in determining both roll  and turn information. After the completion of a turn, return  to straight flight is accomplished by coordinated aileron and  rudder pressure to level the miniature aircraft. Include the  miniature aircraft in the cross-check and correct for even  the smallest deviations from the desired position. When  this instrument is used to maintain straight flight, control  pressures must be applied very lightly and smoothly.  

The ball of the turn coordinator is actually a separate  instrument, conveniently located under the miniature  aircraft because the two instruments are used together.  The ball instrument indicates the quality of the turn. If the  ball is off-center, the airplane is slipping or skidding. That  is, if the coordinator’s miniature airplane is tilted left and  the ball is displaced to the right, the aircraft is in a skid.  [Figure 7-18]  If however, the miniature airplane is tilted to  the right with the ball off-center to the right, the aircraft is in  a slip.  [Figure 7-19]  If the wings are level and the airplane  is properly trimmed, the ball remains in the center, and the  airplane is in straight flight. If the ball is not centered, the  airplane is improperly trimmed.  

![](images/b23f55418f2492efc17147e8b9c15c222a92b64a671987968074caa62a733f05.jpg)

# Skid indication.  Figure 7-19.  Slip indication.  

To maintain straight-and-level flight with proper trim, note  the direction of ball displacement. If the ball is to the left of  center and the left wing is low, apply left rudder pressure  to center the ball and correct the slip. At the same time,  apply right aileron pressure as necessary to level the wings,  cross-checking the heading indicator and attitude indicator  while centering the ball. If the wings are level and the ball is  displaced from the center, the airplane is skidding. Note the  direction of ball displacement and use the same corrective  technique as for an indicated slip. Center the ball (left ball/ left rudder, right ball/right rudder), use aileron as necessary  for bank control and retrim.  

To trim the airplane using only the turn coordinator, use  aileron pressure to level the miniature aircraft and rudder  pressure to center the ball. Hold these indications with control  pressures, gradually releasing them while applying rudder  trim sufficient to relieve all rudder pressure. Apply aileron  trim, if available, to relieve aileron pressure. With a full  instrument panel, maintain a wings-level attitude by reference  to all available instruments while trimming the airplane.  

# Turn-and-Slip Indicator (Needle and Ball)  

Unlike the turn coordinator that provides three indications  (roll, turn, and trim), the turn-and-slip indicator provides  two: turn-rate and trim. Although the turn-and-slip indicator  needle provides an indication of turn only, it provides an  indirect indication of aircraft attitude when used with roll  indicators, such as a heading indicator or magnetic compass.  As with the turn coordinator (after stabilizing from a roll),  when the turn-and-slip indicator’s needle is aligned with the  alignment marks, the aircraft is in a standard turn of 3 degrees  per second or  $360^{\circ}$   in 2 minutes.  

The ball of the turn-and-bank indicator provides important  trim in the same manner that the ball in the turn coordinator  does.  Figures 7-18  and  7-19  provide a comparison of the  two instruments.  

# Power Control  

Power produces thrust which, with the appropriate angle of  attack of the wing, overcomes the forces of gravity, drag,  and inertia to determine airplane performance.  

Power control must be related to its effect on altitude and  airspeed, since any change in power setting results in a change  in the airspeed or the altitude of the airplane. At any given  airspeed, the power setting determines whether the airplane  is in level flight, in a climb, or in a descent. If the power is  increased in straight-and-level flight and the airspeed held  constant, the airplane climbs. If power is decreased while  the airspeed is held constant, the airplane descends. On the  other hand, if altitude is held constant, the power applied  determines the airspeed.  

The relationship between altitude and airspeed determines the  need for a change in pitch or power. If the airspeed is not the  desired value, always check the altimeter before deciding that  a power change is necessary. Think of altitude and airspeed  as interchangeable; altitude can be traded for airspeed by  lowering the nose or convert airspeed to altitude by raising  the nose. If altitude is higher than desired and airspeed is  low, or vice versa, a change in pitch alone may return the  airplane to the desired altitude and airspeed.  [Figure 7-20]  If  both airspeed and altitude are high or if both are low, then a  change in both pitch and power is necessary in order to return  to the desired airspeed and altitude.  [Figure 7-21]  

For changes in airspeed in straight-and-level flight, pitch,  bank, and power must be coordinated in order to maintain  constant altitude and heading. When power is changed to  vary airspeed in straight-and-level flight, a single-engine,  propeller-driven airplane tends to change attitude around all  axes of movement. Therefore, to maintain constant altitude  and heading, apply various control pressures in proportion  to the change in power. When power is added to increase  airspeed, the pitch instruments indicate a climb unless  forward elevator control pressure is applied as the airspeed  changes. With an increase in power, the airplane tends to  yaw and roll to the left unless counteracting aileron and  rudder pressures are applied. Keeping ahead of these changes  requires increasing cross-check speed, which varies with the  type of airplane and its torque characteristics, the extent of  power, and speed change involved.  

# Power Settings  

Power control and airspeed changes are much easier when  approximate power settings necessary to maintain various  airspeeds in straight-and-level flight are known in advance.  However, to change airspeed by any appreciable amount, the  common procedure is to underpower or overpower on initial  power changes to accelerate the rate of airspeed change.  

(For small speed changes, or in airplanes that decelerate  or accelerate rapidly, overpowering or underpowering is  not necessary.)  

Consider the example of an airplane that requires 23 inches  of mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   of manifold pressure to maintain a normal  cruising airspeed of 120 knots, and   $18\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   of manifold  pressure to maintain an airspeed of 100 knots. The reduction  in airspeed from 120 knots to 100 knots while maintaining  straight-and-level flight is discussed below and illustrated in  Figures 7-22, 7-23,  and  7-24 .  

Instrument indications, prior to the power reduction, are  shown in  Figure 7-22 . The basic attitude is established and  maintained on the attitude indicator. The specific pitch,  bank, and power control requirements are detected on these  primary instruments:  

Altimeter—Primary Pitch  Heading Indicator—Primary Bank  Airspeed Indicator—Primary Power  

Supporting pitch-and-bank instruments are shown in  Figure 7-23 . Note that the supporting power instrument is  the manifold pressure gauge (or tachometer if the propeller  is fixed pitch). However, when a smooth power reduction to  approximately   $15~"\mathrm{Hg}$   (underpower) is made, the manifold  pressure gauge becomes the primary power instrument.  [Figure 7-23]  With practice, power setting can be changed  with only a brief glance at the power instrument, by sensing

the movement of the throttle, the change in sound, and the  changes in the feel of control pressures.  

As thrust decreases, increase the speed of the cross-check  and be ready to apply left rudder, back-elevator, and aileron  control pressure the instant the pitch-and-bank instruments  show a deviation from altitude and heading. As proficiency  is obtained, a pilot learns to cross-check, interpret, and  control the changes with no deviation of heading and  altitude. Assuming smooth air and ideal control technique  as airspeed decreases, a proportionate increase in airplane  pitch attitude is required to maintain altitude. Similarly,  effective torque control means counteracting yaw with  rudder pressure.  

As the power is reduced, the altimeter is primary for  pitch, the heading indicator is primary for bank, and the  manifold pressure gauge is momentarily primary for power  (at   $15~"\mathrm{Hg}$   in this example). Control pressures should be  trimmed off as the airplane decelerates. As the airspeed  approaches the desired airspeed of 100 knots, the manifold  pressure is adjusted to approximately   $18\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   and becomes  the supporting power instrument. The ASI again becomes  primary for power.  [Figure 7-24]  

# Airspeed Changes in Straight-and-Level Flight  

Practice of airspeed changes in straight-and-level flight provides  an excellent means of developing increased proficiency in all  three basic instrument skills and brings out some common  errors to be expected during training in straight-and-level flight.  Having learned to control the airplane in a clean configuration  (minimum drag conditions), increase proficiency in cross- check and control by practicing speed changes while extending  or retracting the flaps and landing gear. While practicing, be  sure to comply with the airspeed limitations specified in the  POH/AFM for gear and flap operation.  

Sudden and exaggerated attitude changes may be necessary  in order to maintain straight-and-level flight as the landing  gear is extended and the flaps are lowered in some airplanes.  The nose tends to pitch down with gear extension, and when  flaps are lowered, lift increases momentarily (at partial flap  settings) followed by a marked increase in drag as the flaps  near maximum extension.  

Control technique varies according to the lift and drag  characteristics of each airplane. Accordingly, knowledge of  the power settings and trim changes associated with different  combinations of airspeed, gear, and flap configurations  reduces instrument cross-check and interpretation problems.  

For example, assume that in straight-and-level flight  instruments indicate 120 knots with power at  $23\ "\mathrm{Hg}/2,300$    revolutions per minute (rpm), gear and flaps up. After  reduction in airspeed, with gear and flaps fully extended,  straight-and-level flight at the same altitude requires  $25\:\mathrm{"Hg}$    manifold pressure/2,500 rpm. Maximum gear extension  speed is 115 knots; maximum flap extension speed is 105  knots. Airspeed reduction to 95 knots, gear and flaps down,  can be made in the following manner:  

1.	 Maintain rpm at 2,500, since a high power setting is  used in full drag configuration. 2.	 Reduce manifold pressure to   $10\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . As the airspeed  decreases, increase cross-check speed. 3.	 Make trim adjustments for an increased angle of attack  and decrease in torque. 4.	 Lower the gear at 115 knots. The nose may tend to  pitch down and the rate of deceleration increases.  Increase pitch attitude to maintain constant altitude,  and trim off some of the back-elevator pressures.  If full flaps are lowered at 105 knots, cross-check,  interpretation, and control must be very rapid. A  simpler technique is to stabilize attitude with gear  down before lowering the flaps.  5.	 Since   $18\,\mathrm{~"Hg}$   manifold pressure will hold level  flight at 100 knots with the gear down, increase  power smoothly to that setting until the ASI shows  approximately 105 knots. The attitude indicator now  shows approximately two-and-a-half bar width nose- high in straight-and-level flight. 6.	 Actuate the flap control and simultaneously increase  power to the predetermined setting   $(25\ \mathrm{"Hg})$   for the  desired airspeed, and trim off the pressures necessary  to hold constant altitude and heading. The attitude  indicator now shows a bar width nose-low in straight- and-level flight at 95 knots.  

Proficiency in straight-and-level flight is attained when a  pilot can consistently maintain constant altitude and heading  with smooth pitch, bank, power, and trim control during the  pronounced changes in aircraft attitude.  

# Trim Technique  

Proper trim technique is essential for smooth and precise  aircraft control during all phases of flight. By relieving all  control pressures, it is much easier to hold a given attitude  constant and devote more attention to other flight deck duties.  

An aircraft is trimmed by applying control pressures to  establish a desired attitude, then adjusting the trim so the  aircraft maintains that attitude when the flight controls are  released. Trim the aircraft for coordinated flight by centering  the ball of the turn-and-slip indicator, by using rudder trim in  the direction the ball is displaced from the center. Differential  power control on multiengine aircraft is an additional factor  affecting coordinated flight. Use balanced power or thrust,  when possible, to aid in maintaining coordinated flight.  

Changes in attitude, power, or configuration requires a trim  adjustment in most cases. Using trim alone to establish a  change in aircraft attitude invariably leads to erratic aircraft  control. Smooth and precise attitude changes are best attained  by a combination of control pressures and trim adjustments.  Therefore, when used correctly, trim adjustment is an aid to  smooth aircraft control.  

# Common Errors in Straight-and-Level Flight  Pitch  

Pitch errors usually result from the following faults:  

1.	 Improper adjustment of the attitude indicator’s  miniature aircraft to the wings-level attitude.  Following the initial level off from a climb, check the  attitude indicator and make any necessary adjustment  in the miniature aircraft for level flight indication at  normal cruise airspeed.  2.	 Insufficient cross-check and interpretation of pitch  instruments. For example, the airspeed indication is  low. The pilot, believing a nose-high attitude exists,  applies forward pressure without noting that a low  power setting is the cause of the airspeed discrepancy.  Increase cross-check speed to include all relevant  instrument indications before making a control input.  3. 	 Uncaging the attitude indicator (if caging feature is  present) when the airplane is not in level flight. The  altimeter and heading indicator must be stabilized with  airspeed indication at normal cruise before pulling  out the caging knob to obtain correct indications in  straight-and-level flight at normal cruise airspeed.  4.	 Failure to interpret the attitude indicator in terms of  the existing airspeed.  5.	 Late pitch corrections. Pilots commonly like to leave  well enough alone. When the altimeter indicates a 20  foot error, there is a reluctance to correct it, perhaps  because of fear of overcontrolling. If overcontrolling  is the anticipated error, practice small corrections and  find the cause of overcontrolling. If any deviation is  tolerated, errors increase. 6.	 Chasing the vertical speed indications. This tendency  can be corrected by proper cross-check of other  pitch instruments, as well as by increasing overall  understanding of instrument characteristics.  7.	 Using excessive pitch corrections for the altimeter  evaluation. Rushing a pitch correction by making a  large pitch change usually aggravates the existing  error, saving neither time nor effort.  

8.	 Failure to maintain established pitch corrections,  a common error associated with cross-check and  trim errors. For example, having established a  pitch change to correct an altitude error, there is a  tendency to slow down the cross-check, waiting for  the airplane to stabilize in the new pitch attitude. To  maintain the attitude, continue to cross-check and  trim off the pressures.  

9.	 Fixations during cross-check. After initiating a  heading correction, for example, there is a tendency  to become preoccupied with bank control and miss  errors in pitch attitude. Likewise, during an airspeed  change, unnecessary gazing at the power instrument  is common. A small error in power setting is of less  consequence than large altitude and heading errors.  The airplane will not decelerate any faster by staring  at the manifold pressure gauge.  

# Heading  

Heading errors usually result from the following faults:  

1.	 Failure to cross-check the heading indicator, especially  during changes in power or pitch attitude.  2.	 Misinterpretation of changes in heading, with resulting  corrections in the wrong direction.  3.	 Failure to note and remember a preselected heading.  4.	 Failure to observe the rate of heading change and its  relation to bank attitude.  5.	 Overcontrolling in response to heading changes,  especially during changes in power settings.  6.	 Anticipating heading changes with premature  application of rudder control.  7.	 Failure to correct small heading deviations. Unless  zero error in heading is the goal, a pilot will tolerate  larger and larger deviations. Correction of a 1 degree  error takes a lot less time and concentration than  correction of a  $20^{\circ}$   error.  8.	 Correcting with improper bank attitude. If correcting a   $10^{\circ}$   heading error with  $20^{\circ}$   of bank, the airplane rolls  past the desired heading before the bank is established,  requiring another correction in the opposite direction.  Do not multiply existing errors with errors in  corrective technique.  9.	 Failure to note the cause of a previous heading error  and thus repeating the same error. For example, the  airplane is out of trim, with a left wing low tendency.  Repeated corrections for a slight left turn are made,  yet trim is ignored. 10.	 Failure to set the heading indicator properly or failure  to uncage it.  

# Power  

Power errors usually result from the following faults:  

1.	 Failure to know the power settings and pitch attitudes  appropriate to various airspeeds and airplane  configurations.  2.	 Abrupt use of throttle. 3.	 Failure to lead the airspeed when making power  changes. For example, during airspeed reduction in  level flight, especially with gear and flaps extended,  adjust the throttle to maintain the slower speed  before the airspeed actually reaches the desired  speed. Otherwise, the airplane decelerates to a speed  lower than that desired, resulting in additional power  adjustments. The amount of lead depends upon how  fast the airplane responds to power changes.  4.	 Fixation on airspeed or manifold pressure instruments  during airspeed changes, resulting in erratic control  of both airspeed and power.  

# Trim  

Trim errors usually result from the following faults:  

1.	 Improper adjustment of seat or rudder pedals for  comfortable position of legs and feet. Tension in the  ankles makes it difficult to relax rudder pressures.  2.	 Confusion about the operation of trim devices that  differ among various airplane types. Some trim wheels  are aligned appropriately with the airplane’s axes;  others are not. Some rotate in a direction contrary to  what is expected.  3.	 Faulty sequence in trim technique. Trim should be  used not as a substitute for control with the wheel  (stick) and rudders, but to relieve pressures already  held to stabilize attitude. As proficiency is gained, little  conscious effort is required to trim off the pressures  as they occur.  4.	 Excessive trim control. This induces control pressures  that must be held until the airplane is trimmed  properly. Use trim frequently and in small amounts.  5.	 Failure to understand the cause of trim changes. Lack  of understanding the basic aerodynamics related to  basic instrument skills causes a pilot to continually  lag behind the airplane.  

# Straight Climbs and Descents  

# Climbs  

For a given power setting and load condition, there is only  one attitude that gives the most efficient rate of climb. The  airspeed and climb power setting that determines this climb  attitude are given in the performance data found in the POH/ AFM. Details of the technique for entering a climb vary  according to airspeed on entry and the type of climb (constant  airspeed or constant rate) desired. (Heading and trim control  are maintained as discussed in straight-and-level flight.)  

# Entry  

To enter a constant-airspeed climb from cruising airspeed,  raise the miniature aircraft to the approximate nose-high  indication for the predetermined climb speed. The attitude  varies according to the type of airplane. Apply light back- elevator pressure to initiate and maintain the climb attitude.  The pressures vary as the airplane decelerates. Power may  be advanced to the climb power setting simultaneously with  the pitch change or after the pitch change is established and  the airspeed approaches climb speed. If the transition from  level flight to climb is smooth, the VSI shows an immediate  trend upward, continues to move slowly, and then stops at  a rate appropriate to the stabilized airspeed and attitude.  (Primary and supporting instruments for the climb entry are  shown in  Figure 7-25 .)  

Once the airplane stabilizes at a constant airspeed and attitude,  the ASI is primary for pitch and the heading indicator remains  primary for bank.  [Figure 7-26]  Monitor the tachometer or  manifold pressure gauge as the primary power instrument to  ensure the proper climb power setting is being maintained.  If the climb attitude is correct for the power setting selected,  the airspeed will stabilize at the desired speed. If the airspeed  is low or high, make an appropriately small pitch correction.  

To enter a constant airspeed climb, first complete the airspeed  reduction from cruise airspeed to climb speed in straight- and-level flight. The climb entry is then identical to entry  from cruising airspeed, except that power must be increased  simultaneously to the climb setting as the pitch attitude is  increased. Climb entries on partial panel are more easily  and accurately controlled if entering the maneuver from  climbing speed.  

The technique for entering a constant-rate climb is very  similar to that used for entry to a constant-airspeed climb  from climb airspeed. As the power is increased to the  approximate setting for the desired rate, simultaneously  raise the miniature aircraft to the climbing attitude for the  desired airspeed and rate of climb. As the power is increased,  the ASI is primary for pitch control until the vertical speed  approaches the desired value. As the vertical speed needle  stabilizes, it becomes primary for pitch control and the ASI  becomes primary for power control.  [Figure 7-27]

Figure 7-27.  Stabilized climb at constant rate.  

Pitch and power corrections must be promptly and closely  coordinated. For example, if the vertical speed is correct, but  the airspeed is low, add power. As the power is increased,  the miniature aircraft must be lowered slightly to maintain  constant vertical speed. If the vertical speed is high and the  airspeed is low, lower the miniature aircraft slightly and note  the increase in airspeed to determine whether or not a power  change is also necessary.  [Figure 7-28]  Familiarity with the  approximate power settings helps to keep pitch and power  corrections at a minimum.  

# Leveling Off  

To level off from a climb and maintain an altitude, it is  necessary to start the level off before reaching the desired  altitude. The amount of lead varies with rate of climb and  pilot technique. If the airplane is climbing at   $1{,}000~\mathrm{fpm}$  , it  continues to climb at a decreasing rate throughout the transition  to level flight. An effective practice is to lead the altitude by  10 percent of the vertical speed shown   $(500\,\mathrm{fpm}/50)$  -foot lead,  1,000 fpm/100-foot lead).  

To level off at cruising airspeed, apply smooth, steady  forward-elevator pressure toward level flight attitude for  the speed desired. As the attitude indicator shows the pitch  change, the vertical speed needle moves slowly toward zero,  the altimeter needle moves more slowly, and the airspeed  shows acceleration.  [Figure 7-29]  When the altimeter, attitude  indicator, and VSI show level flight, constant changes in pitch  and torque control have to be made as the airspeed increases.  As the airspeed approaches cruising speed, reduce power to  the cruise setting. The amount of lead depends upon the rate  of acceleration of the airplane.  

To level off at climbing airspeed, lower the nose to the  pitch attitude appropriate to that airspeed in level flight.  Power is simultaneously reduced to the setting for that  airspeed as the pitch attitude is lowered. If power reduction  is at a rate proportionate to the pitch change, airspeed will  remain constant.  

# Descents  

A descent can be made at a variety of airspeeds and attitudes  by reducing power, adding drag, and lowering the nose to  a predetermined attitude. The airspeed eventually stabilizes  at a constant value. Meanwhile, the only flight instrument  providing a positive attitude reference is the attitude indicator.  Without the attitude indicator (such as during a partial panel  descent), the ASI, altimeter, and VSI show varying rates of  change until the airplane decelerates to a constant airspeed at  a constant attitude. During the transition, changes in control  pressure and trim, as well as cross-check and interpretation,  must be accurate to maintain positive control.

Figure 7-29.  Level off at cruising speed.  

# Entry  

The following method for entering descents is effective  with or without an attitude indicator. First, reduce airspeed  to a selected descent airspeed while maintaining straight- and-level flight, then make a further reduction in power  (to a predetermined setting). As the power is adjusted,  simultaneously lower the nose to maintain constant airspeed,  and trim off control pressures.  

During a constant airspeed descent, any deviation from the  desired airspeed calls for a pitch adjustment. For a constant  rate descent, the entry is the same, but the VSI is primary for  pitch control (after it stabilizes near the desired rate), and the  ASI is primary for power control. Pitch and power must be  closely coordinated when corrections are made, as they are  in climbs.  [Figure 7-30]  

# Leveling Off  

The level off from a descent must be started before reaching  the desired altitude. The amount of lead depends upon the  rate of descent and control technique. With too little lead,  the airplane tends to overshoot the selected altitude unless  technique is rapid. Assuming a 500 fpm rate of descent, lead  the altitude by 100–150 feet for a level off at an airspeed  higher than descending speed. At the lead point, add power to  the appropriate level flight cruise setting.  [Figure 7-31]  Since  the nose tends to rise as the airspeed increases, hold  forward elevator pressure to maintain the vertical speed at  the descending rate until approximately 50 feet above the  altitude, and then smoothly adjust the pitch attitude to the  level flight attitude for the airspeed selected.  

To level off from a descent at descent airspeed, lead the  desired altitude by approximately 50 feet, simultaneously  adjusting the pitch attitude to level flight and adding power to  a setting that holds the airspeed constant.  [Figure 7-32]  Trim  off the control pressures and continue with the normal  straight-and-level flight cross-check.  

# Common Errors in Straight Climbs and Descents Common errors result from the following faults:  

1.	 Overcontrolling pitch on climb entry. Until the pitch  attitudes related to specific power settings used in  climbs and descents are known, larger than necessary  pitch adjustments are made. One of the most difficult  habits to acquire during instrument training is to  restrain the impulse to disturb a flight attitude until  the result is known. Overcome the inclination to  make a large control movement for a pitch change,  and learn to apply small control pressures smoothly,  cross-checking rapidly for the results of the change,  and continuing with the pressures as instruments show  the desired results. Small pitch changes can be easily  controlled, stopped, and corrected; large changes are  more difficult to control.

2.	 Failure to vary the rate of cross-check during  speed, power, or attitude changes or climb or  descent entries. 

 3.	 Failure to maintain a new pitch attitude. For example,  raising the nose to the correct climb attitude, and as  the airspeed decreases, either overcontrol and further  increase the pitch attitude or allow the nose to lower.  As control pressures change with airspeed changes,  cross-check must be increased and pressures readjusted. 

 4.	 Failure to trim off pressures. Unless the airplane is  trimmed, there is difficulty in determining whether  control pressure changes are induced by aerodynamic  changes or by the pilot’s own movements. 

 5.	 Failure to learn and use proper power settings. 

 6.	 Failure to cross-check both airspeed and vertical speed  before making pitch or power adjustments. 

 7.	 Improper pitch and power coordination on slow-speed  level offs due to slow cross-check of airspeed and  altimeter indications. 

 8.	 Failure to cross-check the VSI against the other  pitch control instruments, resulting in chasing the  vertical speed. 

 9.	 Failure to note the rate of climb or descent to determine  the lead for level offs, resulting in overshooting or  undershooting the desired altitude.  

10.	 Ballooning (allowing the nose to pitch up) on level  offs from descents, resulting from failure to maintain  descending attitude with forward-elevator pressure as  power is increased to the level flight cruise setting.  11.	 Failure to recognize the approaching straight-and-level  flight indications as level off is completed. Maintain  an accelerated cross-check until positively established  in straight-and-level flight.  

# Turns  

# Standard Rate Turns  

A standard rate turn is one in which the pilot will do a  complete   $360^{\circ}$   circle in 2 minutes or 3 degrees per second.  A standard rate turn, although always 3 degrees per second,  requires higher angles of bank as airspeed increases. To  enter a standard rate level turn, apply coordinated aileron  and rudder pressures in the desired direction of turn. Pilots  commonly roll into turns at a much too rapid rate. During  initial training in turns, base control pressures on the rate of  cross-check and interpretation. Maneuvering an airplane faster  than the capability to keep up with the changes in instrument  indications only creates the need to make corrections.  

A rule of thumb to determine the approximate angle of bank  required for a standard rate turn is to use 15 percent of the  true airspeed. A simple way to determine this amount is to  divide the airspeed by 10 and add one-half the result. For  example, at 100 knots, approximately  $15^{\circ}$   of bank is required   $(100\div10=10+5=15)$  ); at 120 knots, approximately   $18^{\circ}$  of bank is needed for a standard rate turn.  

On the roll-in, use the attitude indicator to establish  the approximate angle of bank, and then check the turn  coordinator’s miniature aircraft for a standard rate turn  indication or the aircraft’s turn-and-bank indicator. Maintain  the bank for this rate of turn, using the turn coordinator’s  miniature aircraft as the primary bank reference and the  attitude indicator as the supporting bank instrument.  [Figure 7-33]  Note the exact angle of bank shown on  the banking scale of the attitude indicator when the turn  coordinator indicates a standard rate turn.  

During the roll-in, check the altimeter, VSI, and attitude  indicator for the necessary pitch adjustments as the vertical  lift component decreases with an increase in bank. If constant  airspeed is to be maintained, the ASI becomes primary for  power, and the throttle must be adjusted as drag increases. As  the bank is established, trim off the pressures applied during  pitch and power changes.  

To recover to straight-and-level flight, apply coordinated  aileron and rudder pressures opposite to the direction of  the turn. Strive for the same rate of roll-out used to roll into  the turn; fewer problems are encountered in estimating the  lead necessary for roll-out on exact headings, especially on  partial panel maneuvers. Upon initiation of the turn recovery,  the attitude indicator becomes the primary bank instrument.  When the airplane is approximately level, the heading  indicator is the primary bank instrument as in straight-and- level flight. Pitch, power, and trim adjustments are made as  changes in vertical lift component and airspeed occur. The  ball should be checked throughout the turn, especially if  control pressures are held rather than trimmed off.  

Some airplanes are very stable during turns, requiring only  slight trim adjustments that permit hands-off flight while  the airplane remains in the established attitude. Other  airplanes require constant, rapid cross-check and control  during turns to correct overbanking tendencies. Due to the  interrelationship of pitch, bank, and airspeed deviations  during turns, cross-check must be fast in order to prevent  an accumulation of errors.  

# Turns to Predetermined Headings  

As long as an airplane is in a coordinated bank, it continues  to turn. Thus, the roll-out to a desired heading must be started  before the heading is reached. The amount of lead varies with  the relationship between the rate of turn, angle of bank, and  rate of recovery. For small heading changes, use a bank angle  that does not exceed the number of degrees to be turned. Lead  the desired heading by one-half the number of degrees of  bank used. For example, if a  $10^{\circ}$   bank is used during a change  in heading, start the roll-out 5 degrees before reaching the  desired heading. For larger changes in heading, the amount  

![](images/8d1235850278d2db592fbcf1577d95e52aaf8c3fa9084dc345341395747c1148.jpg)  
Figure 7-33.  Standard rate turn, constant airspeed.  

of lead varies since the angle of bank for a standard rate turn  varies with the true airspeed.  

Practice with a lead of one-half the angle of bank until  the precise lead a given technique requires is determined.  If rates of roll-in and roll-out are consistent, the precise  amount of lead suitable to a particular roll-out technique  can be determined.  

# Timed Turns  

A timed turn is a turn in which the clock and the turn  coordinator are used to change heading by a specific number  of degrees in a given time. For example, in a standard rate turn  (3 degrees per second), an airplane turns  $45^{\circ}$   in 15 seconds; in  a half standard rate turn, the airplane turns  $45^{\circ}$   in 30 seconds.  

Prior to performing timed turns, the turn coordinator should  be calibrated to determine the accuracy of its indications.  [Figure 7-34]  Establish a standard rate turn as indicated by  the turn coordinator, and as the sweep-second hand of the  clock passes a cardinal point (12, 3, 6, 9), check the heading  on the heading indicator. While holding the indicated rate  of turn constant, note the indicated heading changes at 10  second intervals. If the airplane turns more than or less than   $30^{\circ}$   in that interval, a respectively larger or smaller deflection  of the miniature aircraft of the turn coordinator is necessary  to produce a standard rate turn. After calibrating the turn  coordinator during turns in each direction, note the corrected  deflections, if any, and apply them during all timed turns.  

The same cross-check and control technique is used in making  a timed turn that is used to execute turns to predetermined  headings, except the clock is substituted for the heading  indicator. The miniature aircraft of the turn coordinator is  primary for bank control, the altimeter is primary for pitch  control, and the ASI is primary for power control. Start the  roll-in when the clock’s second hand passes a cardinal point,  hold the turn at the calibrated standard rate indication (or  half-standard rate for small heading changes), and begin the  roll-out when the computed number of seconds has elapsed.  If the rates of roll-in and roll-out are the same, the time taken  during entry and recovery does not need to be considered in  the time computation.  

Practice timed turns with a full instrument panel and check  the heading indicator for the accuracy of turns. If the turns are  executed without the gyro heading indicator, use the magnetic  compass at the completion of the turn to check turn accuracy,  taking compass deviation errors into consideration.  

# Compass Turns  

In most small airplanes, the magnetic compass is the only  direction-indicating instrument independent of other airplane  instruments and power sources. Because of its operating  characteristics, called compass errors, pilots are prone to  use it only as a reference for setting the heading indicator,  but knowledge of magnetic compass characteristics permits  full use of the instrument to turn the airplane to correct and  maintain headings.  

![](images/39fe1c8ec6c766189b7ee09464146ec90cbf214fcfc293b9e93eb543a365dfb1.jpg)  
Figure 7-34.  Turn coordinator calibration.  

Remember the following points when making turns to  magnetic compass headings or when using the magnetic  compass as a reference for setting the heading indicator:  

1.	 If on a north heading and a turn is started to the east or  west, the compass indication lags or indicates a turn  in the opposite direction.  2.	 If on a south heading and a turn is started toward  the east or west, the compass indication precedes  the turn, indicating a greater amount of turn than is  actually occurring.  3.	 When on an east or west heading, the compass indicates  correctly when starting a turn in either direction.  4.	 If on an east or west heading, acceleration results in  a north turn indication; deceleration results in a south  turn indication.  5.	 When maintaining a north or south heading, no error  results from diving, climbing, or changing airspeed.  

With an angle of bank between   $15^{\circ}$   and   $18^{\circ}$  , the amount of  lead or lag to be used when turning to northerly or southerly  headings varies with, and is approximately equal to, the  latitude of the locality over which the turn is being made.  When turning to a heading of north, the lead for roll-out must  include the number of degrees of change of latitude, plus the  lead normally used in recovery from turns. During a turn to  a south heading, maintain the turn until the compass passes  south the number of degrees of latitude, minus normal roll- out lead.  [Figure 7-35]  

For example, when turning from an easterly direction to  north, where the latitude is  $30^{\circ}$  , start the roll-out when the  compass reads  $37^{\circ}$   (  $30^{\circ}$   plus one-half the  $15^{\circ}$   angle of bank,  or whatever amount is appropriate for the rate of roll-out).  When turning from an easterly direction to south, start the  roll-out when the magnetic compass reads   $203^{\circ}$   (  $180^{\circ}$   plus   $30^{\circ}$   minus one-half the angle of bank). When making similar  turns from a westerly direction, the appropriate points at  which to begin the roll-out would be  $323^{\circ}$   for a turn to north  and   $157^{\circ}$   for a turn to south.  

When turning to a heading of east or west from a northerly  direction, start the roll-out approximately   $10^{\circ}$   to   $12^{\circ}$   before  the east or west indication is reached. When turning to an east  or west heading from a southerly direction, start the rollout  approximately 5 degrees before the east or west indication  is reached. When turning to other headings, the lead or lag  must be interpolated.  

Abrupt changes in attitude or airspeed and the resulting erratic  movements of the compass card make accurate interpretations  of the instrument very difficult. Proficiency in compass turns  

![](images/44a00db1f6243f6dd2c7f99ae66dfc46de02cb99f9433a4023b809601d1d8d49.jpg)  
Figure 7-35.  North and south turn error.  

depends on knowledge of compass characteristics, smooth  control technique, and accurate bank-and-pitch control.  

# Steep Turns  

For purposes of instrument flight training in conventional  airplanes, any turn greater than a standard rate is considered  steep.  [Figure 7-36]  The exact angle of bank at which a  normal turn becomes steep is unimportant. What is important  is learning to control the airplane with bank attitudes in  excess of those normally used on instruments. Practicing  steep turns will not only increase proficiency in the basic  instrument flying skills, but also enable smooth, quick, and  confident reactions to unexpected abnormal flight attitudes  under instrument flight conditions.  

Pronounced changes occur in the effects of aerodynamic  forces on aircraft control at progressively greater bank  attitudes. Skill in cross-check, interpretation, and control is  increasingly necessary in proportion to the amount of these  changes, though the techniques for entering, maintaining, and  recovering from the turn are the same in principle for steep  turns as for shallower turns.  

Enter a steep turn in the same way as a shallower turn,  but prepare to cross-check rapidly as the turn steepens.  Because of the greatly reduced vertical lift component, pitch  control is usually the most difficult aspect of this maneuver.  Unless immediately noted and corrected with a pitch  

![](images/1bdd381075a3e547add43bdbbd3b470f75707c7877ec729de11c0b1c43d2ba81.jpg)  
Figure 7-36.  Steep left turn.  

increase, the loss of vertical lift results in rapid movement  of the altimeter, vertical speed, and airspeed needles. The  faster the rate of bank change, the more suddenly the lift  changes occur. If a cross-check is fast enough to note the  immediate need for pitch changes, smooth, steady back- elevator pressure will maintain constant altitude. However,  overbanking to excessively steep angles without adjusting  pitch as the bank changes occur requires increasingly  stronger elevator pressure. The loss of vertical lift and  increase in wing loading finally reach a point at which  further application of back-elevator pressure tightens the  turn without raising the nose.  

How does a pilot recognize overbanking and low pitch  attitude? What should a pilot do to correct them? If a rapid  downward movement of the altimeter needle or vertical speed  needle, together with an increase in airspeed, is observed  despite application of back elevator pressure, the airplane is in  a diving spiral.  [Figure 7-37]  Immediately shallow the bank  with smooth and coordinated aileron and rudder pressures,  hold or slightly relax elevator pressure, and increase the cross- check of the attitude indicator, altimeter, and VSI. Reduce  power if the airspeed increase is rapid. When the vertical  speed trends upward, the altimeter needle moves slower as  the vertical lift increases. When the elevator is effective in  raising the nose, hold the bank attitude shown on the attitude  indicator and adjust elevator control pressures smoothly for  the nose-high attitude appropriate to the bank maintained.  If pitch control is consistently late on entries to steep turns,  rollout immediately to straight-and-level flight and analyze  possible errors. Practice shallower turns initially and learn the  attitude changes and control responses required, then increase  the banks as a quicker and more accurate cross-check and  control techniques are developed.  

The power necessary to maintain constant airspeed increases  as the bank and drag increase. With practice, the power  

![](images/a84f8ed323da8a4510d6ca33da8db50b551dc9cba0a840d0de01d3c0ee6be178.jpg)  

settings appropriate to specific bank attitudes are learned, and  adjustments can be made without undue attention to airspeed  and power instruments. During training in steep turns, as in  any other maneuver, attend to the most important tasks first.  Keep the pitch attitude relatively constant, and more time  can be devoted to cross-check and instrument interpretation.  

During recovery from steep turns to straight-and-level  flight, elevator and power control must be coordinated with  bank control in proportion to the changes in aerodynamic  forces. Back elevator pressures must be released and power  decreased. The common errors associated with steep turns are  the same as those discussed later in this section. Remember,  errors are more exaggerated, more difficult to correct, and  more difficult to analyze unless rates of entry and recovery  are consistent with the level of proficiency in the three basic  instrument flying skills.  

# Climbing and Descending Turns  

To execute climbing and descending turns, combine the  technique used in straight climbs and descents with the various  turn techniques. The aerodynamic factors affecting lift and  power control must be considered in determining power  settings, and the rate of cross-check and interpretation must be  increased to enable control of bank as well as pitch changes.  

# Change of Airspeed During Turns  

Changing airspeed during turns is an effective maneuver for  increasing proficiency in all three basic instrument skills.  Since the maneuver involves simultaneous changes in all  components of control, proper execution requires rapid  cross-check and interpretation as well as smooth control.  Proficiency in the maneuver also contributes to confidence in  the instruments during attitude and power changes involved  in more complex maneuvers. Pitch and power control  techniques are the same as those used during changes in  airspeed in straight-and-level flight.  

The angle of bank necessary for a given rate of turn is  proportional to the true airspeed. Since the turns are executed  at a standard rate, the angle of bank must be varied in direct  proportion to the airspeed change in order to maintain a  constant rate of turn. During a reduction of airspeed, decrease  the angle of bank and increase the pitch attitude to maintain  altitude and a standard rate turn.  

The altimeter and turn coordinator indications should remain  constant throughout the turn. The altimeter is primary for  pitch control and the miniature aircraft of the turn coordinator  is primary for bank control. The manifold pressure gauge (or  tachometer) is primary for power control while the airspeed  is changing. As the airspeed approaches the new indication,  the ASI becomes primary for power control.  

Two methods of changing airspeed in turns may be used. In the  first method, airspeed is changed after the turn is established.  [Figure 7-38]  In the second method, the airspeed change is  initiated simultaneously with the turn entry. The first method  is easier, but regardless of the method used, the rate of cross- check must be increased as power is reduced. As the airplane  decelerates, check the altimeter and VSI for necessary pitch  changes and the bank instruments for required bank changes.  

![](images/2879addcb0b58c8cd233c8e10bc51634c328b0a157c81c0fc2fcb94c83259535.jpg)  
Figure 7-38.  Change of airspeed during turn.  

If the miniature aircraft of the turn coordinator indicates a  deviation from the desired deflection, adjust the bank. Adjust  pitch attitude to maintain altitude. When approaching the  desired airspeed, pitch attitude becomes primary for power  control and the manifold pressure gauge (or tachometer) is  adjusted to maintain the desired airspeed. Trim is important  throughout the maneuver to relieve control pressures.  

Until control technique is very smooth, frequent cross-check  of the attitude indicator is essential to prevent overcontrolling  and to provide approximate bank angles appropriate to the  changing airspeeds.  

# Common Errors in Turns Pitch  

# Pitch errors result from the following faults:  

1.	 Preoccupation with bank control during turn entry  and recovery. If 5 seconds are required to roll into a  turn, check the pitch instruments as bank pressures  are initiated. If bank control pressure and rate of bank  change are consistent, a sense of the time required  for an attitude change is developed. During the  interval, check pitch, power, and trim—as well as  bank—controlling the total attitude instead of one  factor at a time.  2.	 Failure to understand or remember the need for  changing the pitch attitude as the vertical lift  component changes, resulting in consistent loss of  altitude during entries.  3.	 Changing the pitch attitude before it is necessary. This  fault is very likely if a cross-check is slow and rate  of entry too rapid. The error occurs during the turn  entry due to a mechanical and premature application  of back-elevator control pressure.  4.	 Overcontrolling the pitch changes. This fault  commonly occurs with the previous error.  5.	 Failure to properly adjust the pitch attitude as the  vertical lift component increases during the roll-out,  resulting in consistent gain in altitude on recovery  to headings.  6.	 Failure to trim during turn entry and following turn  recovery (if turn is prolonged).  7.	 Failure to maintain straight-and-level cross-check  after roll-out. This error commonly follows a perfectly  executed turn.  8.	 Erratic rates of bank change on entry and recovery,  resulting from failure to cross-check the pitch  instruments with a consistent technique appropriate  to the changes in lift.  

# Bank  

Bank and heading errors result from the following faults:  

1.	 Overcontrolling, resulting in overbanking upon turn  entry, overshooting and undershooting headings, as  well as aggravated pitch, airspeed, and trim errors.  

2.	 Fixation on a single bank instrument. On a  $90^{\circ}$   change  of heading, for example, leave the heading indicator  out of the cross-check for approximately 20 seconds  after establishing a standard rate turn, since at   $3^{\circ}$  per second the turn will not approach the lead point  until that time has elapsed. Make the cross-check  selective, checking only what needs to be checked at  the appropriate time.  

3.	 Failure to check for precession of the horizon bar  following recovery from a turn. If the heading indicator  shows a change in heading when the attitude indicator  shows level flight, the airplane is turning. If the ball  is centered, the attitude gyro has precessed; if the ball  is not centered, the airplane may be in a slipping or  skidding turn. Center the ball with rudder pressure,  check the attitude indicator and heading indicator, stop  the heading change if it continues, and retrim.  

4.	 Failure to use the proper degree of bank for the amount  of heading change desired. Rolling into a   $20^{\circ}$   bank  for a heading change of   $10^{\circ}$   will normally overshoot  the heading. Use the bank attitude appropriate to the  amount of heading change desired.  

5.	 Failure to remember the heading to which the aircraft  is being turned. This fault is likely when rushing  the maneuver.  

6.	 Turning in the wrong direction, due to misreading or  misinterpreting the heading indicator, or to confusion  regarding the location of points on the compass. Turn  in the shortest direction to reach a given heading,  unless there is a specific reason to turn the long way  around. Study the compass rose and visualize at least  the positions of the eight major points around the  azimuth. A number of methods can be used to make  quick computations for heading changes. For example,  to turn from a heading of  $305^{\circ}$   to a heading of  $110^{\circ}$  ,  would a pilot turn right or left for the shortest way  around? Subtracting 200 from 305 and adding 20,  gives   $125^{\circ}$   as the reciprocal of  $305^{\circ}$  ; therefore, execute  the turn to the right. Likewise, to figure the reciprocal  of a heading less than  $180^{\circ}$  , add 200 and subtract 20.  Computations are done more quickly using multiples  of 100s and 10s than by adding or subtracting   $180^{\circ}$    from the actual heading; therefore, the method  suggested above may save time and confusion.  

7.	 Failure to check the ball of the turn coordinator when  interpreting the instrument for bank information. If the  roll rate is reduced to zero, the miniature aircraft of  the turn coordinator indicates only direction and rate  of turn. Unless the ball is centered, do not assume the  turn is resulting from a banked attitude.  

# Power  

Power and airspeed errors result from the following faults:  

1.	 Failure to cross-check the ASI as pitch changes  are made.  2.	 Erratic use of power control. This may be due to  improper throttle friction control, inaccurate throttle  settings, chasing the airspeed readings, abrupt or  overcontrolled pitch-and-bank changes, or failure  to recheck the airspeed to note the effect of a  power adjustment.  3.	 Poor coordination of throttle control with pitch-and- bank changes associated with slow cross-check or  failure to understand the aerodynamic factors related  to turns.  

# Trim  

Trim errors result from the following faults:  

1.	 Failure to recognize the need for a trim change due  to slow cross-check and interpretation. For example,  a turn entry at a rate too rapid for a cross-check leads  to confusion in cross-check and interpretation with  resulting tension on the controls.  2.	 Failure to understand the relationship between trim  and attitude/power changes.  3.	 Chasing the vertical speed needle. Overcontrolling  leads to tension and prevents sensing the pressures to  be trimmed off.  4.	 Failure to trim following power changes.  

# Errors During Compass Turns  

In addition to the faults discussed above, the following errors  connected with compass turns should be noted:  

1.	 Faulty understanding or computation of lead and lag.  2.	 Fixation on the compass during the roll-out. Until  the airplane is in straight-and-level unaccelerated  flight, it is unnecessary to read the indicated heading.  Accordingly, after the roll-out, cross-check for  straight-and-level flight before checking the accuracy  of the turn.  

# Approach to Stall  

Practicing approach to stall recoveries in various airplane  configurations should build confidence in a pilot’s ability to  control the airplane in unexpected situations. Approach to  stall should be practiced from straight flight and from shallow  banks. The objective is to practice recognition and recovery  from the approach to a stall.  

Prior to stall recovery practice, select a safe altitude above  the terrain, an area free of conflicting air traffic, appropriate  weather, and the availability of radar traffic advisory service.  

Approaches to stalls are accomplished in the following  configurations:  

1.	 Takeoff configuration—should begin from level flight  near liftoff speed. Power should be applied while  simultaneously increasing the angle of attack to induce  an indication of a stall.  2.	 Clean configuration—should begin from a reduced  airspeed, such as pattern airspeed, in level flight.  Power should be applied while simultaneously  increasing the angle of attack to induce an indication  of a stall.  3.	 Approach or landing configuration—should be  initiated at the appropriate approach or landing  airspeed. The angle of attack should be smoothly  increased to induce an indication of a stall.  

Recoveries should be prompt in response to a stall warning  device or an aerodynamic indication by smoothly reducing  the angle of attack and applying maximum power or as  recommended by the POH/AFM. The recovery should be  completed without an excessive loss of altitude and on a  predetermined heading, altitude, and airspeed.  

# Unusual Attitudes and Recoveries  

An unusual attitude is an airplane attitude not normally  required for instrument flight. Unusual attitudes may  result from a number of conditions, such as turbulence,  disorientation, instrument failure, confusion, preoccupation  with flight deck duties, carelessness in cross-checking,  errors in instrument interpretation, or lack of proficiency in  aircraft control. Since unusual attitudes are not intentional  maneuvers during instrument flight, except in training, they  are often unexpected, and the reaction of an inexperienced  or inadequately trained pilot to an unexpected abnormal  flight attitude is usually instinctive rather than intelligent  and deliberate. This individual reacts with abrupt muscular  effort, which is purposeless and even hazardous in turbulent  conditions, at excessive speeds, or at low altitudes. However,  with practice, the techniques for rapid and safe recovery from  unusual attitudes can be mastered.  

When an unusual attitude is noted during the cross-check,  the immediate problem is not how the airplane got there, but  what it is doing and how to get it back to straight-and-level  flight as quickly as possible.  

# Recognizing Unusual Attitudes  

As a general rule, any time an instrument rate of movement  or indication other than those associated with the basic  instrument flight maneuvers is noted, assume an unusual  attitude and increase the speed of cross-check to confirm the  attitude, instrument error, or instrument malfunction.  

Nose-high attitudes are shown by the rate and direction of  movement of the altimeter needle, vertical speed needle, and  airspeed needle, as well as the immediately recognizable  indication of the attitude indicator (except in extreme  attitudes).  [Figure 7-39]  Nose-low attitudes are shown  by the same instruments, but in the opposite direction.  [Figure 7-40]  

# Recovery from Unusual Attitudes  

In moderate unusual attitudes, the pilot can normally  reorient by establishing a level flight indication on the  attitude indicator. However, the pilot should not depend on  this instrument if the attitude indicator is the spillable type,  because its upset limits may have been exceeded or it may  have become inoperative due to mechanical malfunction.  If it is the nonspillable-type instrument and is operating  properly, errors up to 5 degrees of pitch-and-bank may result  and its indications are very difficult to interpret in extreme  attitudes. As soon as the unusual attitude is detected, the  recommended recovery procedures stated in the POH/AFM  should be initiated. If there are no recommended procedures  stated in the POH/AFM, the recovery should be initiated by  reference to the ASI, altimeter, VSI, and turn coordinator.  

# Nose-High Attitudes  

If the airspeed is decreasing, or below the desired airspeed,  increase power (as necessary in proportion to the observed  deceleration), apply forward elevator pressure to lower the  nose and prevent a stall, and correct the bank by applying  coordinated aileron and rudder pressure to level the  miniature aircraft and center the ball of the turn coordinator.  The corrective control applications are made almost  simultaneously, but in the sequence given above. A level  pitch attitude is indicated by the reversal and stabilization

Figure 7-40.  Unusual attitude—nose-low.  

of the ASI and altimeter needles. Straight coordinated flight  is indicated by the level miniature aircraft and centered ball  of the turn coordinator.  

# Nose-Low Attitudes  

If the airspeed is increasing, or is above the desired airspeed,  reduce power to prevent excessive airspeed and loss of  altitude. Correct the bank attitude with coordinated aileron  and rudder pressure to straight flight by referring to the turn  coordinator. Raise the nose to level flight attitude by applying  smooth back elevator pressure. All components of control  should be changed simultaneously for a smooth, proficient  recovery. However, during initial training a positive,  confident recovery should be made by the numbers, in the  sequence given above. A very important point to remember  is that the instinctive reaction to a nose-down attitude is to  pull back on the elevator control.  

After initial control has been applied, continue with a  fast cross-check for possible overcontrolling, since the  necessary initial control pressures may be large. As the rate  of movement of altimeter and ASI needles decreases, the  attitude is approaching level flight. When the needles stop  and reverse direction, the aircraft is passing through level  flight. As the indications of the ASI, altimeter, and turn  coordinator stabilize, incorporate the attitude indicator into  the cross-check.  

The attitude indicator and turn coordinator should be checked  to determine bank attitude and then corrective aileron  and rudder pressures should be applied. The ball should  be centered. If it is not, skidding and slipping sensations  can easily aggravate disorientation and retard recovery. If  entering the unusual attitude from an assigned altitude (either  by an instructor or by air traffic control (ATC) if operating  under instrument flight rules (IFR)), return to the original  altitude after stabilizing in straight-and-level flight.  

# Common Errors in Unusual Attitudes  

Common errors associated with unusual attitudes include  the following faults:  

1.	 Failure to keep the airplane properly trimmed. A flight  deck interruption when holding pressures can easily  lead to inadvertent entry into unusual attitudes.  2	 Disorganized flight deck. Hunting for charts, logs,  computers, etc., can seriously distract attention from  the instruments.  3.	 Slow cross-check and fixations. The impulse is to  stop and stare when noting an instrument discrepancy  unless a pilot has trained enough to develop the skill  required for immediate recognition.  

4.	 Attempting to recover by sensory sensations other than  sight. The discussion of disorientation in Chapter 3,  Human Factors, indicates the importance of trusting  the instruments.  5.	 Failure to practice basic instrument skills. All of the  errors noted in connection with basic instrument skills  are aggravated during unusual attitude recoveries until  the elementary skills have been mastered.  

# Instrument Takeoff  

Competency in instrument takeoffs will provide the  proficiency and confidence necessary for use of flight  instruments during departures under conditions of low  visibility, rain, low ceilings, or disorientation at night. A  sudden rapid transition from “visual” to “instrument” flight  can result in serious disorientation and control problems.  

Instrument takeoff techniques vary with different types of  airplanes, but the method described below is applicable  whether the airplane is single- or multiengine; tricycle gear  or conventional gear.  

Align the airplane with the centerline of the runway with  the nosewheel or tailwheel straight. Lock the tailwheel, if  so equipped, and hold the brakes firmly to avoid creeping  while preparing for takeoff. Set the heading indicator with  the nose index on the 5 degree mark nearest the published  runway heading to allow instant detection of slight changes in  heading during the takeoff. Make certain that the instrument  is uncaged (if it has a caging feature) by rotating the knob  after uncaging and checking for constant heading indication.  If using an electric heading indicator with a rotatable needle,  rotate the needle so that it points to the nose position, under  the top index. Advance the throttle to an rpm that will provide  partial rudder control. Release the brakes, advancing the  power smoothly to takeoff setting.  

During the takeoff roll, hold the heading constant on the  heading indicator by using the rudder. In multiengine,  propeller-driven airplanes, also use differential throttle to  maintain direction. The use of brakes should be avoided,  except as a last resort, as it usually results in overcontrolling  and extending the takeoff roll. Once the brakes are released,  any deviation in heading must be corrected instantly.  

As the airplane accelerates, cross-check both heading  indicator and ASI rapidly. The attitude indicator may precess  to a slight nose-up attitude. As flying speed is approached  (approximately 15–25 knots below takeoff speed), smoothly  apply elevator control for the desired takeoff attitude on the  attitude indicator. This is approximately a two bar width  climb indication for most small airplanes.  

Continue with a rapid cross-check of heading indicator and  attitude indicator as the airplane leaves the ground. Do not  pull it off; let it fly off while holding the selected attitude  constant. Maintain pitch-and-bank control by referencing  the attitude indicator, and make coordinated corrections in  heading when indicated on the heading indicator. Cross- check the altimeter and VSI for a positive rate of climb  (steady clockwise rotation of the altimeter needle, and the VSI  showing a stable rate of climb appropriate to the airplane).  

When the altimeter shows a safe altitude (approximately 100  feet), raise the landing gear and flaps, maintaining attitude by  referencing the attitude indicator. Because of control pressure  changes during gear and flap operation, overcontrolling is  likely unless the pilot notes pitch indications accurately and  quickly. Trim off control pressures necessary to hold the  stable climb attitude. Check the altimeter, VSI, and airspeed  for a smooth acceleration to the predetermined climb speed  (altimeter and airspeed increasing, vertical speed stable). At  climb speed, reduce power to climb setting (unless full power  is recommended for climb by the POH/AFM and trim).  

Throughout the instrument takeoff, cross-check and  interpretation must be rapid and control positive and smooth.  During liftoff, gear and flap retraction, power reduction, and  the changing control reactions demand rapid cross-check,  adjustment of control pressures, and accurate trim changes.  

# Common Errors in Instrument Takeoffs  

Common errors during the instrument takeoff include  the following:  

1.	 Failure to perform an adequate flight deck check  before the takeoff. Pilots have attempted instrument  takeoffs with inoperative airspeed indicators (pitot  tube obstructed), gyros caged, controls locked, and  numerous other oversights due to haste or carelessness.  2.	 Improper alignment on the runway. This may result  from improper brake application, allowing the  airplane to creep after alignment or from alignment  with the nosewheel or tailwheel cocked. In any case,  the result is a built-in directional control problem as  the takeoff starts.  3.	 Improper application of power. Abrupt application  of power complicates directional control. Add power  with a smooth, uninterrupted motion.  4.	 Improper use of brakes. Incorrect seat or rudder pedal  adjustment, with feet in an uncomfortable position,  frequently cause inadvertent application of brakes and  excessive heading changes.  

5.	 Overcontrolling rudder pedals. This fault may be  caused by late recognition of heading changes, tension  on the controls, misinterpretation of the heading  indicator (and correcting in the wrong direction),  failure to appreciate changing effectiveness of rudder  control as the aircraft accelerates, and other factors. If  heading changes are observed and corrected instantly  with small movement of the rudder pedals, swerving  tendencies can be reduced.  

6.	 Failure to maintain attitude after becoming airborne.  If the pilot reacts to seat-of-the-pants sensations when  the airplane lifts off, pitch control is guesswork.  The pilot may either allow excessive pitch or apply  excessive forward elevator pressure, depending on the  reaction to trim changes.  

7.	 Inadequate cross-check. Fixations are likely during trim  changes, attitude changes, gear and flap retractions,  and power changes. Once an instrument or a control  input is applied, continue the cross-check and note the  effect during the next cross-check sequence.  

8.	 Inadequate interpretation of instruments. Failure to  understand instrument indications immediately indicates  that further study of the maneuver is necessary.  

# Basic Instrument Flight Patterns  

Flight patterns are basic maneuvers, flown by sole reference  to the instruments rather than outside visual clues, for the  purpose of practicing basic attitude flying. The patterns  simulate maneuvers encountered on instrument flights,  such as holding patterns, procedure turns, and approaches. After attaining a reasonable degree of proficiency in basic  maneuvers, apply these skills to the various combinations of  individual maneuvers. The following practice flight patterns  are directly applicable to operational instrument flying.  

# Racetrack Pattern  

1.	 Time 3 minutes straight-and-level flight from A to B.  [Figure 7-41]  During this interval, reduce airspeed to  the holding speed appropriate for the aircraft.  2.	 Start a  $180^{\circ}$   standard rate turn to the right at B. Roll- out at C on the reciprocal of the heading originally  used at A.  3.	 Time a 1 minute straight-and-level flight from C to D.  4.	 Start a  $180^{\circ}$   standard rate turn to the right at D, rolling- out on the original heading.  5.	 Fly 1 minute on the original heading, adjusting the  outbound leg so that the inbound segment is 1 minute.

Figure 7-41.   Racetrack pattern (entire pattern in level flight).  

NOTE :  This pattern is an exercise combining use of the clock  with basic maneuvers.  

# Procedure Turn  

A procedure turn is a maneuver that facilitates:  

•	 A reversal in flight direction. •	 A descent from an initial approach fix or assigned  altitude to a permissible altitude (usually the procedure  turn altitude). •	 An interception of the inbound course at a sufficient  distance allowing the aircraft to become aligned with  the final approach.  

Procedure turn types include the  $45^{\circ}$   turn, the  $80/260\,\mathrm{turn}$  , and  the teardrop turn. All of these turns are normally conducted no  more than 10 nautical miles (NM) from the primary airport.  The procedure turn altitude generally provides a minimum  of 1,000' obstacle clearance in the procedure turn area (not  necessarily within the  $10\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   arc around the primary airport).  Turns may have to be increased or decreased but should not  exceed   $30^{\circ}$   of a bank angle.  

# Standard   $\pmb{45^{\circ}}$   Procedure Turn  

1.	 Start timing at point A (usually identified on approach  procedures by a fix). For example, fly outbound on a  heading of   $360^{\circ}$   for a given time (2 minutes, in this  example).  [Figure 7-42]   2.	 After flying outbound for 2 minutes (point B), turn left   $45^{\circ}$   to a heading of   $315^{\circ}$   using a standard rate turn.  After roll-out and stabilizing, fly this new heading  of  $315^{\circ}$   for 40 seconds and the aircraft will be at the  approximate position of C.  

![](images/d9be851912232775fe85daee264979673dd5779cf66c699e4bfb0c05dc6d59bc.jpg)  
Figure 7-42.   Standard procedure turn (entire pattern in level flight).  

3.	 At point C, turn  $225^{\circ}$   right (using a standard rate turn)  Figure 5-42  which will provide a heading of   $180^{\circ}$  . The timing is  such that in a no wind environment, the pilot will be  aligned with the final approach course of   $180^{\circ}$   at D.  Wind conditions, however must be considered during  the execution of the procedure turn. Compensating  for wind may result in changes to outbound time,  procedure turn heading and/or time and minor changes  in the inbound turn.  

# 80/260 Procedure Turn  

1.	 Start timing at point A (usually identified on approach  procedures by a fix). For example, fly outbound on a  heading of   $360^{\circ}$   for 2 minutes.  [Figure 7-43]  

![](images/90c0cdfba2ea95181dea179a0ca4cf80dcfb8a9b26d1e11b70e931bcb84bbf4b.jpg)  
Figure 7-43.   80/260 procedure turn (entire pattern in level flight).  

2.	 At B, enter a left standard rate turn of  $80^{\circ}$   to a heading  of  $280^{\circ}$  .  

3.	 At the completion of the  $80^{\circ}$   turn to   $280^{\circ}$   (Point C),  immediately turn right  $260^{\circ}$  , rolling-out on a heading  of   $180^{\circ}$   (Point D) and also the reciprocal of the  entry heading.  

# Teardrop Patterns  

There are three typical teardrop procedure turns. A  $30^{\circ}$  ,  $20^{\circ}$  ,  and a   $10^{\circ}$   teardrop pattern. The below steps indicate actions  for all three starting on a heading of   $360^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 7-44]  

![](images/062a0479b253e83408fe87483b43d558ecc6a9dadd4d801039a9b4a49906a80a.jpg)  
Figure 7-44.  Teardrop pattern (entire pattern in level flight).  

1.	 At point B (after stabilizing on the outbound course)  turn left:  

• 	  $30^{\circ}$   to a heading of  $330^{\circ}$   and time for 1 minute • 	  $20^{\circ}$   to a heading of  $340^{\circ}$   and time for 2 minutes • 	  $10^{\circ}$   to a heading of  $350^{\circ}$   and time for 3 minutes  

2.	 After the appropriate time above (Point C), make a  standard rate turn to the right for:  

•	 $30^{\circ}$  teardrop— $.210^{\circ}$  to the final course heading of  $180^{\circ}$  (Point D)•	 $20^{\circ}$  teardrop— $.200^{\circ}$  to the final course heading of  $180^{\circ}$  (Point D)•	 $10^{\circ}$  teardrop— $190^{\circ}$  to the final course heading of  $180^{\circ}$  (Point D)  

By using the different teardrop patterns, a pilot is afforded the  ability to manage time more efficiently. For instance, a   $10^{\circ}$  pattern for 3 minutes provides about three times the distance  (and time) than a   $30^{\circ}$   pattern. Pattern selection should be  based upon an individual assessment of the procedure turn  requirements to include wind, complexity, the individual  preparedness, etc.  

# Circling Approach Patterns Pattern I  

1.	 At A, start timing for 2 minutes from A to B; reduce  airspeed to approach speed.  [Figure 7-45]   2.	 At B, make a standard rate turn to the left for  $45^{\circ}$  .  3.	 At the completion of the turn, time for 45 seconds  to C.  4.	 At C, turn to the original heading; fly 1 minute to D,  lowering the landing gear and flaps.  5.	 At D, turn right  $180^{\circ}$  , rolling-out at E on the reciprocal  of the entry heading.  6.	 At E, enter a 500 fpm rate descent. At the end of a 500  foot descent, enter a straight constant-airspeed climb,  retracting gear and flaps.  

![](images/d95bd19fb9a7f389bfbcd628ca6cc6e9910028503e8c9cb3132df2a907573898.jpg)

# Pattern II  

Steps:  

1.	 At A, start timing for 2 minutes from A to B; reduce  airspeed to approach speed.  [Figure 7-46]   2.	 At B, make a standard rate turn to the left for  $45^{\circ}$  .  3.	 At the completion of the turn, time for 1 minute to C.  4.	 At C, turn right for   $180^{\circ}$   to D; fly for 1-1/2 minutes  to E, lowering the landing gear and flaps.  5.	 At E, turn right for   $180^{\circ}$  , rolling-out at F.  6.	 At F, enter a  $500\,\mathrm{fpm}$   rate descent. At the end of a 500  foot descent, enter a straight constant-airspeed climb,  retracting gear and flaps.

# Airplane Basic  Flight Maneuvers  

Using an Electronic Flight Display  

# Introduction  

The previous chapters have laid the foundation for instrument  flying. The pilot’s ability to use and interpret the information  displayed and apply corrective action is required to maneuver  the aircraft and maintain safe flight. A pilot must recognize  that each aircraft make and model flown may require a  different technique. Aircraft weight, speed, and configuration  changes require the pilot to vary his or her technique in order  to perform successful attitude instrument flying. A pilot must  become familiar with all sections of the Pilot’s Operating  Handbook/Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM) prior to  performing any flight maneuver.  

Chapter 7, Section II describes basic attitude instrument  flight maneuvers and explains how to perform each one  by interpreting the indications presented on the electronic  flight display (EFD). In addition to normal flight maneuvers,  “partial panel” flight is addressed. With the exception of the  instrument takeoff, all flight maneuvers can be performed on 

 “partial panel” with the Attitude Heading Reference System 

 (AHRS) unit simulated or rendered inoperative.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

# Pitch Control  

The pitch attitude of an airplane is the angle between the  longitudinal axis of the airplane and the actual horizon.  In level flight, the pitch attitude varies with airspeed and  load. For training purposes, the latter factor can normally  be disregarded in small airplanes. At a constant airspeed,  there is only one specific pitch attitude for level flight. At  slow cruise speeds, the level flight attitude is nose-high with  indications as in  Figure 7-47 ; at fast cruise speeds, the level  flight attitude is nose-low.  [Figure 7-48]   Figure 7-49  shows  the indications for the attitude at normal cruise speeds.  

![](images/4174a989974b1cb37e6b94071287c09cef9e8fc5b1ffcf9ede3d89a403d18a5e.jpg)  
Figure 7-47.  Pitch attitude and airspeed in level flight, slow  cruise speed.

Figure 7-49.  Various pitch attitudes (right), aircraft shown in  level flight.  

The instruments that directly or indirectly indicate pitch on  the primary flight display (PFD) are the attitude indicator,  altimeter, vertical speed indicator (VSI), airspeed indicator  (ASI), and both airspeed and altitude trend indicators.  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator gives the pilot a direct indication of  the pitch attitude. The increased size of the attitude display  on the EFD system greatly increases situational awareness  for the pilot. Most attitude indicators span the entire width  of the PFD screen.  

![](images/c72447e7074f05162f73055d211fcb45056e02c1090b617935ca1a3643469ae5.jpg)  
Figure 7-48.  Pitch attitude decreasing and airspeed increasing—indicates need to increase pitch.  

The aircraft pitch attitude is controlled by changing the  deflection of the elevator. As the pilot pulls back on the  control yoke causing the elevator to rise, the yellow chevron  begins to show a displacement up from the artificial horizon  line. This is caused by the AHRS unit sensing the changing  angle between the longitudinal plane of the earth and the  longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  

The attitude indicator displayed on the PFD screen is a  representation of outside visual cues. Rather than rely on the  natural horizon visible during visual flight rules (VFR) flight,  the pilot must rely on the artificial horizon of the PFD screen.  

During normal cruise airspeed, the point of the yellow  chevron (aircraft symbol) is positioned on the artificial  horizon. Unlike conventional attitude indicators, the EFD  attitude indicator does not allow for manipulating the position  of the chevron in relationship to the artificial horizon. The  position is fixed and therefore always display the pitch angle  as calculated by the AHRS unit.  

The attitude indicator only shows pitch attitude and does  not indicate altitude. A pilot should not attempt to maintain  level flight using the attitude indicator alone. It is important  for the pilot to understand how small displacements both up  and down can affect the altitude of the aircraft. To achieve  this, the pilot should practice increasing the pitch attitude  incrementally to become familiar with how each degree of  pitch changes the altitude.  [Figures 7-50  and  7-51]  In both  cases, the aircraft will slow and gain altitude.  

![](images/fc098e5dcd94983dcf936707824c858c90edfc9061ac0da8546b651b4bb0b397.jpg)  
Figure 7-50.  Pitch indications for various attitudes (  $I^{\circ}$   through  $5^{\circ}$  ).  

The full height of the chevron is approximately 5 degrees  and provides an accurate reference for pitch adjustment. It is  imperative that the pilot make the desired changes to pitch by  referencing the attitude indicator and then trimming off any  excess control pressures. Relieving these pressures allow for  a more stabilized flight and reduces pilot work load. Once the  aircraft is trimmed for level flight, the pilot must smoothly  

![](images/a199a7e00b45482307e0a1a0ea2464a4311326f94a530870980bf2b169f2089d.jpg)  
Figure 7-51.  Pitch illustrated at 10 °  

and precisely manipulate the elevator control forces in order  to change the pitch attitude.  

To master the ability to smoothly control the elevator, a pilot  must develop a very light touch on the control yoke. The  thumb and two fingers are normally sufficient to move the  control yoke. The pilot should avoid griping the yoke with  a full fist. When a pilot grips the yoke with a full fist, there  is a tendency to apply excess pressures, thus changing the  aircraft attitude.  

Practice making smooth, small pitch changes both up and  down until precise corrections can be made. With practice,  a pilot is able to make pitch changes in 1 degree increments,  smoothly controlling the attitude of the aircraft.  

The last step in mastering elevator control is trim. Trimming  the aircraft to relieve any control pressures is essential  for smooth attitude instrument flight. To accomplish this,  momentarily release the control yoke. Note which way the  aircraft pitch attitude wants to move. Grasp the control yoke  again and then reapply the pressure to return the attitude to the  previous position. Apply trim in the direction of the control  pressure. Small applications of trim make large changes in  the pitch attitude. Be patient and make multiple changes to  trim, if necessary.  

Once the aircraft is in trim, relax on the control yoke as  much as practicable. When pressure is held on the yoke,  unconscious pressures are applied to the elevator and ailerons,  which displaces the aircraft from its desired flightpath. If the  aircraft is in trim, in calm, non-turbulent air, a pilot should be  able to release the control yoke and maintain level flight for  extended periods of time. This is one of the hardest skills to  learn prior to successfully flying in instrument meteorological  conditions (IMC).  

# Altimeter  

At constant power, any deviation from level flight (except  in turbulent air) must be the result of a pitch change. If the  power is constant, the altimeter gives an indirect indication  of the pitch attitude in level flight. Since the altitude should  remain constant when the airplane is in level flight, any  deviation from the desired altitude signals the need for a  pitch change. For example, if the aircraft is gaining altitude,  the nose must be lowered.  

In the PFD, as the pitch starts to change, the altitude trend  indicator on the altitude tape begins to show a change in  the direction of displacement. The rate at which the trend  indicator grows and the altimeter numbers change aids the  pilot in determining how much of a pitch change is necessary  to stop the trend.  

As a pilot becomes familiar with a specific aircraft’s  instruments, he or she learns to correlate pitch changes,  altimeter tapes, and altitude trend indicators. By adding the  altitude tape display and the altitude trend indicator into the  scan along with the attitude indicator, a pilot starts to develop  the instrument cross-check.  

# Partial Panel Flight  

One important skill to practice is partial panel flight by  referencing the altimeter as the primary pitch indicator.  Practice controlling the pitch by referencing the altitude  tape and trend indicator alone without the use of the attitude  indicator. Pilots need to learn to make corrections to altitude  deviations by referencing the rate of change of the altitude  tape and trend indicator. When operating in IMC and in a  partial panel configuration, the pilot should avoid abrupt  changes to the control yoke. Reacting abruptly to altitude  changes can lead to large pitch changes and thus a larger  divergence from the initial altitude.  

When a pilot is controlling pitch by the altitude tape and  altitude trend indicators alone, it is possible to overcontrol  the aircraft by making a larger than necessary pitch  correction. Overcontrolling causes the pilot to move from  a nose-high attitude to a nose-low attitude and vice versa.  Small changes to pitch are required to insure prompt  corrective actions are taken to return the aircraft to its  original altitude with less confusion.  

When an altitude deviation occurs, two actions need to be  accomplished. First, make a smooth control input to stop  the needle movement. Once the altitude tape has stopped  moving, make a change to the pitch attitude to start back to  the entry altitude.  

During instrument flight with limited instrumentation, it is  imperative that only small and precise control inputs are  made. Once a needle movement is indicated denoting a  deviation in altitude, the pilot needs to make small control  inputs to stop the deviation. Rapid control movements only  compound the deviation by causing an oscillation effect.  This type of oscillation can quickly cause the pilot to become  disoriented and begin to fixate on the altitude. Fixation on  the altimeter can lead to a loss of directional control as well  as airspeed control.  

As a general rule of thumb, for altitude deviations less than  100 feet, utilize a pitch change of 1 degree, which equates to   $\%$   of the thickness of the chevron. Small incremental pitch  changes allow the performance to be evaluated and eliminate  overcontrolling of the aircraft.  

Instrumentation needs to be utilized collectively, but failures  will occur that leave the pilot with only limited instrumentation.  That is why partial panel flying training is important. If the  pilot understands how to utilize each instrument independently,  no significant change is encountered in carrying out the flight  when other instruments fail.  

# VSI Tape  

The VSI tape provides for an indirect indication of pitch  attitude and gives the pilot a more immediate indication of a  pending altitude deviation. In addition to trend information,  the vertical speed also gives a rate indication. By using the  VSI tape in conjunction with the altitude trend tape, a pilot has  a better understanding of how much of a correction needs to  be made. With practice, the pilot will learn the performance  of a particular aircraft and know how much pitch change  is required in order to correct for a specific rate indication.  

Unlike older analog VSIs, new glass panel displays have  instantaneous VSIs. Older units had a lag designed into the  system that was utilized to indicate rate information. The  new glass panel displays utilize a digital air data computer  that does not indicate a lag. Altitude changes are shown  immediately and can be corrected for quickly.  

The VSI tape should be used to assist in determining what  pitch changes are necessary to return to the desired altitude.  A good rule of thumb is to use a vertical speed rate of change  that is double the altitude deviation. However, at no time  should the rate of change be more than the optimum rate of  climb or descent for the specific aircraft being flown. For  example, if the altitude is off by 200 feet from the desired  altitude, then a 400 feet per minute (fpm) rate of change  would be sufficient to get the aircraft back to the original  altitude. If the altitude has changed by 700 feet, then doubling  that would necessitate a 1,400 fpm change. Most aircraft  are not capable of that, so restrict changes to no more than  optimum climb and descent. An optimum rate of change  would vary between 500 and 1,000 fpm.  

One error the instrument pilot encounters is overcontrolling.  Overcontrolling occurs when a deviation of more than 200  fpm is indicated over the optimum rate of change. For  example, an altitude deviation of 200 feet is indicated on  the altimeter, a vertical speed rate of 400 feet should be  indicated on the gauge. If the vertical speed rate showed  600 fpm (200 more than optimum), the pilot would be  overcontrolling the aircraft.  

When returning to altitude, the primary pitch instrument  is the VSI tape. If any deviation from the desired vertical  speed is indicated, make the appropriate pitch change using  the attitude indicator.  

As the aircraft approaches the target altitude, the vertical speed  rate can be slowed in order to capture the altitude in a more  stabilized fashion. Normally within 10 percent of the rate of  climb or descent from the target altitude, begin to slow the  vertical speed rate in order to level off at the target altitude.  This allows the pilot to level at the desired altitude without  rapid control inputs or experiencing discomfort due to G-load.  

# Airspeed Indicator (ASI)  

The ASI presents an indirect indication of the pitch attitude.  At a constant power setting and pitch attitude, airspeed  remains constant. As the pitch attitude lowers, airspeed  increases, and the nose should be raised.  

As the pitch attitude is increased, the nose of the aircraft  raises, which results in an increase in the angle of attack as  well as an increase in induced drag. The increased drag begins  to slow the momentum of the aircraft, which is indicated on  the ASI. The airspeed trend indicator shows a trend as to  where the airspeed will be in 6 seconds. Conversely, if the  nose of the aircraft should begin to fall, the angle of attack,  as well as induced drag, decreases.  

There is a lag associated with the ASI when using it as a pitch  instrument. It is not a lag associated with the construction  of the ASI, but a lag associated with momentum change.  Depending on the rate of momentum change, the ASI may not  indicate a pitch change in a timely fashion. If the ASI is being  used as the sole reference for pitch change, it may not allow  for a prompt correction. However, if smooth pitch changes  are executed, modern glass panel displays are capable of  indicating 1 knot changes in airspeed and also capable of  projecting airspeed trends.  

When flying by reference to flight instruments alone, it  is imperative that all of the flight instruments be cross- checked for pitch control. By cross-checking all pitch related  instruments, the pilot can better visualize the aircraft attitude  at all times.  

As previously stated, the primary instrument for pitch is the  instrument that gives the pilot the most pertinent information  for a specific parameter. When in level flight and maintaining  a constant altitude, what instrument shows a direct indication  of altitude? The only instrument that is capable of showing  altitude is the altimeter. The other instruments are supporting  instruments that are capable of showing a trend away from  altitude, but do not directly indicate an altitude.  

The supporting instruments forewarn of an impending  altitude deviation. With an efficient cross-check, a proficient  pilot is better able to maintain altitude.  

# Bank Control  

This discussion assumes the aircraft is being flown in  coordinated flight, which means the longitudinal axis of the  aircraft is aligned with the relative wind. On the PFD, the  attitude indicator shows if the wings are level. The turn rate  indicator, slip/skid indicator, and the heading indicator also  indicate whether or not the aircraft is maintaining a straight  (zero bank) flightpath.  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator is the only instrument on the PFD that  has the capability of displaying the precise bank angle of the  aircraft. This is made possible by the display of the roll scale  depicted as part of the attitude indicator.  

Figure 7-52  identifies the components that make up the  attitude indicator display. Note that the top of the display is  blue, representing sky, the bottom is brown, depicting dirt,  and the white line separating them is the horizon. The lines  parallel to the horizon line are the pitch scale, which is marked  in 5 degree increments and labeled every 10 degrees. The  pitch scale always remains parallel to the horizon.  

The curved line in the blue area is the roll scale. The triangle  on the top of the scale is the zero index. The hash marks on  the scale represent the degree of bank.  [Figure 7-53]  The  roll scale always remains in the same position relative to  the horizon line.  

![](images/a2b962db48358c4d74075dfb5c67e77301e78d8b17378b7ef56319e2f1e109d3.jpg)

Figure 7-53.  Attitude indicator showing a  $I5^{\circ}$   left bank.  

The roll pointer indicates the direction and degree of bank.  [Figure 7-53]  The roll pointer is aligned with the aircraft  symbol. The roll pointer indicates the angle of the lateral axis  of the aircraft compared to the natural horizon. The slip/skid  indicator will show if the longitudinal axis of the aircraft is  aligned with the relative wind, which is coordinated flight.  With the roll index and the slip/skid indicator aligned, any  deflection, either right or left of the roll index causes the  aircraft to turn in that direction. With the small graduations  on the roll scale, it is easy to determine the bank angle within  approximately 1 degree. In coordinated flight, if the roll  index is aligned with the roll pointer, the aircraft is achieving  straight flight.  

An advantage of EFDs is the elimination of the precession  error. Precession error in analog gauges is caused by forces  being applied to a spinning gyro. With the new solid state  instruments, precession error has been eliminated.  

Since the attitude indicator is capable of showing precise  pitch and bank angles, the only time that the attitude indicator  is a primary instrument is when attempting to fly at a specific  bank angle or pitch angle. Other times, the attitude instrument  can be thought of as a control instrument.  

# Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI)  

The horizontal situation indicator (HSI) is a rotating   $360^{\circ}$  compass card that indicates magnetic heading. The HSI is the  only instrument that is capable of showing exact headings. The  magnetic compass can be used as a backup instrument in case  of an HSI failure; however, due to erratic, unstable movements,  it is more likely to be used a supporting instrument.  

In order for the pilot to achieve the desired rate of change,  it is important for him or her to understand the relationship  between the rate at which the HSI changes heading displays  and the amount of bank angle required to meet that rate of  change. A very small rate of heading change means the bank  angle is small, and it takes more time to deviate from the  desired straight flightpath. A larger rate of heading change  means a greater bank angle happens at a faster rate.  

# Heading Indicator  

The heading indicator is the large black box with a white  number that indicates the magnetic heading of the aircraft.  [Figure 7-54]  The aircraft heading is displayed to the nearest  degree. When this number begins to change, the pilot should  be aware that straight flight is no longer being achieved.

Figure 7-54.  Slip/skid and turn rate indicator.  

# Turn Rate Indicator  

The turn rate indicator gives an indirect indication of bank.  It is a magenta trend indicator capable of displaying half- standard as well as standard rate turns to both the left and  right.  [Figure 7-54]  The turn indicator is capable of indicating  turns up to 4 degrees per second by extending the magenta  line outward from the standard rate mark. If the rate of turn  has exceeded 4 degrees per second, the magenta line can  not precisely indicate where the heading will be in the next  6 seconds; the magenta line freezes and an arrowhead will  be displayed. This alerts the pilot to the fact that the normal  range of operation has been exceeded.  

# Slip/Skid Indicator  

The slip/skid indicator is the small portion of the lower  segmented triangle displayed on the attitude indicator. This  instrument depicts whether the aircraft’s longitudinal axis is  aligned with the relative wind.  [Figure 7-54]  

The pilot must always remember to cross-check the roll index  to the roll pointer when attempting to maintain straight flight.  Any time the heading remains constant and the roll pointer and  the roll index are not aligned, the aircraft is in uncoordinated  flight. To make a correction, the pilot should apply rudder  pressure to bring the aircraft back to coordinated flight.  

# Power Control  

Power produces thrust which, with the appropriate angle of  attack of the wing, overcomes the forces of gravity, drag,  and inertia to determine airplane performance.  

Power control must be related to its effect on altitude and  airspeed, since any change in power setting results in a change  in the airspeed or the altitude of the airplane. At any given  airspeed, the power setting determines whether the airplane  is in level flight, in a climb, or in a descent. If the power is  increased in straight-and-level flight and the airspeed held  constant, the airplane climbs; if power is decreased while  the airspeed is held constant, the airplane descends. On the  other hand, if altitude is held constant, the power applied  determines the airspeed.  

The relationship between altitude and airspeed determines the  need for a change in pitch or power. If the airspeed is off the  desired value, always check the altimeter before deciding that  a power change is necessary. Think of altitude and airspeed  as interchangeable; altitude can be traded for airspeed by  lowering the nose, or convert airspeed to altitude by raising  the nose. If altitude is higher than desired and airspeed is  low, or vice versa, a change in pitch alone may return the  airplane to the desired altitude and airspeed.  [Figure 7-55]  If  both airspeed and altitude are high or if both are low, then a  change in both pitch and power is necessary in order to return  to the desired airspeed and altitude.  [Figure 7-56]  

For changes in airspeed in straight-and-level flight, pitch, bank,  and power must be coordinated in order to maintain constant  

![](images/35cc85b1600ecf4ad489f3d4bd38c45d4854a10bb3c582efc5416f0bb3dec055.jpg)

altitude and heading. When power is changed to vary airspeed  in straight-and-level flight, a single-engine, propeller-driven  airplane tends to change attitude around all axes of movement.  Therefore, to maintain constant altitude and heading, apply  various control pressures in proportion to the change in power.  When power is added to increase airspeed, the pitch instruments  indicate a climb unless forward-elevator control pressure is  applied as the airspeed changes. With an increase in power, the  airplane tends to yaw and roll to the left unless counteracting  aileron and rudder pressures are applied. Keeping ahead of  these changes requires increasing cross-check speed, which  varies with the type of airplane and its torque characteristics,  the extent of power and speed change involved.  

# Power Settings  

Power control and airspeed changes are much easier when  approximate power settings necessary to maintain various  airspeeds in straight-and-level flight are known in advance.  However, to change airspeed by any appreciable amount, the  common procedure is to underpower or overpower on initial  power changes to accelerate the rate of airspeed change. (For  small speed changes, or in airplanes that decelerate or accelerate  rapidly, overpowering or underpowering is not necessary.)  

Consider the example of an airplane that requires 23 inches  of mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   to maintain a normal cruising airspeed of  120 knots, and   $18\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   to maintain an airspeed of 100 knots.  The reduction in airspeed from 120 knots to 100 knots while  maintaining straight-and-level flight is discussed below and  illustrated in  Figures 7-57, 7-58,  and  7-59 .  

Instrument indications, prior to the power reduction, are  shown in  Figure 7-57 . The basic attitude is established and  maintained on the attitude indicator. The specific pitch,  bank, and power control requirements are detected on these  primary instruments:  

Altimeter—Primary Pitch  Heading Indicator—Primary Bank  Airspeed Indicator—Primary Power  

Supporting pitch and bank instruments are shown in  Figure 7-57 . Note that the supporting power instrument is  the manifold pressure gauge (or tachometer if the propeller  is fixed pitch). However, when a smooth power reduction to  approximately   $15~"\mathrm{Hg}$   (underpower) is made, the manifold  pressure gauge becomes the primary power instrument.  [Figure 7-58]  With practice, power setting can be changed  with only a brief glance at the power instrument, by sensing  the movement of the throttle, the change in sound, and the  changes in the feel of control pressures.  

As the thrust decreases, increase the speed of the cross-check  and be ready to apply left rudder, back-elevator, and aileron  control pressure the instant the pitch and bank instruments  show a deviation from altitude and heading. As proficiency  is obtained, a pilot will learn to cross-check, interpret, and  control the changes with no deviation of heading and altitude.  Assuming smooth air and ideal control technique, as airspeed  decreases, a proportionate increase in airplane pitch attitude  is required to maintain altitude. Similarly, effective torque  control means counteracting yaw with rudder pressure.  

As the power is reduced, the altimeter is primary for  pitch, the heading indicator is primary for bank, and the  manifold pressure gauge is momentarily primary for power  (at   $15\ \mathrm{"Hg}$   in  Figure 7-58 ). Control pressures should be  trimmed off as the airplane decelerates. As the airspeed  approaches the desired airspeed of 100 knots, the manifold  pressure is adjusted to approximately   $18\ \mathrm{"Hg}$   and becomes  the supporting power instrument. The ASI again becomes  primary for power.  [Figure 7-59]  

# Airspeed Changes in Straight-and-Level Flight  

Practice of airspeed changes in straight-and-level flight  provides an excellent means of developing increased  proficiency in all three basic instrument skills and brings  out some common errors to be expected during training  in straight-and-level flight. Having learned to control the  airplane in a clean configuration (minimum drag conditions),  increase proficiency in cross-check and control by practicing  speed changes while extending or retracting the flaps and  landing gear. While practicing, be sure to comply with the

Figure 7-59.  Straight-and-level flight (reduced airspeed stabilized).  

airspeed limitations specified in the POH/AFM for gear and  flap operation.  

Sudden and exaggerated attitude changes may be necessary  in order to maintain straight-and-level flight as the landing  gear is extended and the flaps are lowered in some airplanes.  The nose tends to pitch down with gear extension, and when  flaps are lowered, lift increases momentarily (at partial flap  settings) followed by a marked increase in drag as the flaps  near maximum extension.  

Control technique varies according to the lift and drag  characteristics of each airplane. Accordingly, knowledge of  the power settings and trim changes associated with different  combinations of airspeed, gear, and flap configurations  reduces instrument cross-check and interpretation problems.  [Figure 7-60]  

For example, assume that in straight-and-level flight  instruments indicate 120 knots with power at   $23\ \mathrm{"Hg}$  manifold pressure/2,300 revolutions per minute (rpm), gear  and flaps up. After reduction in airspeed, with gear and flaps  fully extended, straight-and-level flight at the same altitude  requires   $25\ \mathrm{"Hg}$   manifold pressure  $/2{,}500~\mathrm{rpm}$  . Maximum  gear extension speed is 115 knots; maximum flap extension  speed is 105 knots. Airspeed reduction to 95 knots, gear and  flaps down, can be made in the following manner:  

1.	 Maintain rpm at 2,500, since a high power setting is  used in full drag configuration.

 2.	 Reduce manifold pressure to   $10\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . As the airspeed  decreases, increase cross-check speed.  

3.	 Make trim adjustments for an increased angle of attack  and decrease in torque.  

4.	 Lower the gear at 115 knots. The nose may tend to  pitch down and the rate of deceleration increases.  Increase pitch attitude to maintain constant altitude  and trim off some of the back-elevator pressures.  If full flaps are lowered at 105 knots, cross-check,  interpretation, and control must be very rapid. A  simpler technique is to stabilize attitude with gear  down before lowering the flaps.  

5.	 Since   $18\ \mathrm{"Hg}$   manifold pressure holds level flight at  100 knots with the gear down, increase power smoothly  to that setting as the ASI shows approximately 105  knots, and retrim. The attitude indicator now shows  approximately two-and-a-half bar width nose-high in  straight-and-level flight.  

6.	 Actuate the flap control and simultaneously increase  power to the predetermined setting   $(25\ \mathrm{"Hg})$   for the  desired airspeed, and trim off the pressures necessary  to hold constant altitude and heading. The attitude  indicator now shows a bar width nose-low in straight- and-level flight at 95 knots.

Figure 7-60.  Cross-check supporting instruments.  

# Trim Technique  

Trim control is one of the most important flight habits to  cultivate. Trimming refers to relieving any control pressures  that need to be applied by the pilot to the control surfaces to  maintain a desired flight attitude. The desired result is for the  pilot to be able to take his or her hands off the control surfaces  and have the aircraft remain in the current attitude. Once the  aircraft is trimmed for hands-off flight, the pilot is able to  devote more time to monitoring the flight instruments and  other aircraft systems.  

In order to trim the aircraft, apply pressure to the control surface  that needs trimming and roll the trim wheel in the direction  pressure is being held. Relax the pressure that is being applied to  the control surface and monitor the primary instrument for that  attitude. If the desired performance is achieved, fly hands off. If  additional trimming is required, redo the trimming steps.  

An aircraft is trimmed for a specific airspeed, not pitch attitude  or altitude. Any time an aircraft changes airspeed, there is  a need to re-trim. For example, an aircraft is flying at 100  knots straight-and-level. An increase of   $50~\mathrm{rpm}$   causes the  airspeed to increase. As the airspeed increases, additional lift  is generated and the aircraft climbs. Once the additional thrust  has stabilized at some higher altitude, the airspeed will again  stabilize at 100 knots.  

This demonstrates how trim is associated with airspeed and  not altitude. If the initial altitude is to be maintained, forward  pressure would need to be applied to the control wheel while  the trim wheel needs to be rolled forward to eliminate any  control pressures. Rolling forward on the trim wheel is equal  to increasing for a trimmed airspeed. Any time the airspeed  is changed, re-trimming is required. Trimming can be  accomplished during any transitional period; however, prior  to final trimming, the airspeed must be held constant. If the  airspeed is allowed to change, the trim is not adjusted properly  and the altitude varies until the airspeed for which the aircraft  is trimmed is achieved.  

# Common Errors in Straight-and-Level Flight Pitch  

Pitch errors usually result from the following errors:  

1.	 Improper adjustment of the yellow chevron (aircraft  symbol) on the attitude indicator.  	 Corrective Action: Once the aircraft has leveled off and  the airspeed has stabilized, make small corrections to  the pitch attitude to achieve the desired performance.  Cross-check the supporting instruments for validation. 2.	 Insufficient cross-check and interpretation of pitch  instruments.  [Figure 7-61]  

![](images/c6c30e676d985226bf79772fde8fcf0e08cbb3e9c8b547c39e9061e53485620d.jpg)  
Figure 7-61.  Insufficient cross-check. The problem is power and not nose-high. In this case, the pilot decreased pitch inappropriately.  

Example: The airspeed indication is low. The pilot,  believing a nose-high pitch attitude exists, applies  forward pressure without noting that a low power setting  is the cause of the airspeed discrepancy.  

Corrective Action: Increase the rate of cross-check of all  the supporting flight instruments. Airspeed and altitude  should be stabilized before making a control input.  

3.	 Acceptance of deviations.  

Example: A pilot has an altitude range of   $\pm100$   feet  according to the practical test standards for straight-and  level-flight. When the pilot notices that the altitude has  deviated by 60 feet, no correction is made because the  altitude is holding steady and is within the standards.  

Corrective Action: The pilot should cross-check the  instruments and, when a deviation is noted, prompt  corrective actions should be taken in order to bring the  aircraft back to the desired altitude. Deviations from  altitude should be expected but not accepted.  

4.	 Overcontrolling—excessive pitch changes.  

Example: A pilot notices a deviation in altitude. In an  attempt to quickly return to altitude, the pilot makes a  large pitch change. The large pitch change destabilizes  the attitude and compounds the error.  

Corrective Action: Small, smooth corrections  should be made in order to recover to the desired  altitude (  $0.5^{\circ}$   to  $2^{\circ}$   depending on the severity of the  deviation). Instrument flying is comprised of small  corrections to maintain the aircraft attitude. When  flying in IMC, a pilot should avoid making large  attitude changes in order to avoid loss of aircraft  control and spatial disorientation.  

5.	 Failure to maintain pitch corrections.  

Pitch changes need to be made promptly and held  for validation. Many times pilots make corrections  and allow the pitch attitude to change due to not  trimming the aircraft. It is imperative that any time a  pitch change is made; the trim is readjusted in order  to eliminate any control pressures that are being held.  A rapid cross-check aids in avoiding any deviations  from the desired pitch attitude.  

Example: A pilot notices a deviation in altitude. A  change in the pitch attitude is accomplished but no  adjustment to the trim is made. Distractions cause  the pilot to slow the cross-check and an inadvertent  reduction in the pressure to the control column  commences. The pitch attitude then changes, thus  complicating recovery to the desired altitude. Corrective Action: The pilot should initiate a pitch  change and then immediately trim the aircraft to  relieve any control pressures. A rapid cross-check  should be established in order to validate the desired  performance is being achieved.  

6.	 Fixation during cross-check.  

Devoting an unequal amount of time to one instrument  either for interpretation or assigning too much  importance to an instrument. Equal amounts of time  should be spent during the cross-check to avoid an  unnoticed deviation in one of the aircraft attitudes.  

Example: A pilot makes a correction to the pitch  attitude and then devotes all of the attention to the  altimeter to determine if the pitch correction is valid.  During this time, no attention is paid to the heading  indicator, which shows a turn to the left.  [Figure 7-62]  

Corrective Action: The pilot should monitor all  instrumentation during the cross-check. Do not fixate  on one instrument waiting for validation. Continue to  scan all instruments to avoid allowing the aircraft to  begin a deviation in another attitude.  

# Heading  

Heading errors usually result from but are not limited to the  following errors:  

1.	 Failure to cross-check the heading indicator, especially  during changes in power or pitch attitude. 2.	 Misinterpretation of changes in heading, with resulting  corrections in the wrong direction. 3.	 Failure to note and remember a preselected heading. 4.	 Failure to observe the rate of heading change and its  relation to bank attitude. 5.	 Overcontrolling in response to heading changes,  especially during changes in power settings. 6.	 Anticipating heading changes with premature  application of rudder pressure. 7.	 Failure to correct small heading deviations. Unless  zero error in heading is the goal, a pilot will tolerate  larger and larger deviations. Correction of a 1 degree  error takes far less time and concentration than  correction of a  $20^{\circ}$   error. 8.	 Correcting with improper bank attitude. If correcting  a   $10^{\circ}$   heading error with a   $20^{\circ}$   bank correction, the  aircraft will roll past the desired heading before the  bank is established, requiring another correction in  the opposite direction. Do not multiply existing errors  with errors in corrective technique.  

![](images/330e096894aa923498cfaa81d4f7e23df6cbdfd98936dad9ad28f42ca66db5ae.jpg)  
Figure 7-62.  The pilot has fixated on pitch and altitude, leaving bank indications unattended. Note the trend line to the left.  

9.	 Failure to note the cause of a previous heading error  and thus repeating the same error. For example, the  airplane is out of trim with a left wing low tendency.  Repeated corrections for a slight left turn are made,  yet trim is ignored.  

# Power  

Power errors usually result from but are not limited to the  following errors:  

1.	 Failure to become familiar with the aircraft’s specific  power settings and pitch attitudes. 2.	 Abrupt use of throttle.  3.	 Failure to lead the airspeed when making power  changes, climbs, or descents. 	 Example: When leveling off from a descent, increase  the power in order to avoid the airspeed from bleeding  off due to the decrease in momentum of the aircraft.  If the pilot waits to bring in the power until after the  aircraft is established in the level pitch attitude, the  aircraft will have already decreased below the speed  desired, which will require additional adjustment in  the power setting.  4.	 Fixation on airspeed tape or manifold pressure  indications during airspeed changes, resulting in  

erratic control of airspeed, power, as well as pitch and  bank attitudes.  

# Trim  

Trim errors usually result from the following faults:  

1.	 Improper adjustment of seat or rudder pedals for  comfortable position of legs and feet. Tension in the  ankles makes it difficult to relax rudder pressures. 2.	 Confusion about the operation of trim devices, which  differ among various airplane types. Some trim  wheels are aligned appropriately with the airplane’s  axes; others are not. Some rotate in a direction  contrary to expectations. 3.	 Failure to understand the principles of trim and  that the aircraft is being trimmed for airspeed, not a  pitch attitude. 4.	 Faulty sequence in trim techniques. Trim should be  utilized to relieve control pressures, not to change  pitch attitudes. The proper trim technique has the pilot  holding the control wheel first and then trimming to  relieve any control pressures. Continuous trim changes  are required as the power setting is changed. Utilize  the trim continuously, but in small amounts.  

# Straight Climbs and Descents  

Each aircraft has a specific pitch attitude and airspeed that  corresponds to the most efficient climb rate for a specified  weight. The POH/AFM contains the speeds that produce the  desired climb. These numbers are based on maximum gross  weight. Pilots must be familiar with how the speeds vary with  weight so they can compensate during flight.  

# Entry Constant Airspeed Climb From Cruise Airspeed  

To enter a constant airspeed climb from cruise airspeed,  slowly and smoothly apply aft elevator pressure in order  to raise the yellow chevron (aircraft symbol) until the tip  points to the desired degree of pitch.  [Figure 7-63]  Hold  the aft control pressure and smoothly increase the power  to the climb power setting. This increase in power may be  initiated either prior to initiating the pitch change or after  having established the desired pitch setting. Consult the POH/ AFM for specific climb power settings if anything other than  a full power climb is desired. Pitch attitudes vary depending  on the type of aircraft being flown. As airspeed decreases,  control forces need to be increased in order to compensate  for the additional elevator deflection required to maintain  attitude. Utilize trim to eliminate any control pressures. By  effectively using trim, the pilot is better able to maintain the  desired pitch without constant attention. The pilot is thus  able to devote more time to maintaining an effective scan of  all instrumentation.  

The VSI should be utilized to monitor the performance of the  aircraft. With a smooth pitch transition, the VSI tape should  begin to show an immediate trend upward and stabilize on a  

![](images/85ea972f35ebba201422683e7275cdb01777f27f5f444262f2f88457d2edecd2.jpg)

rate of climb equivalent to the pitch and power setting being  utilized. Depending on current weight and atmospheric  conditions, this rate will be different. This requires the pilot to  be knowledgeable of how weight and atmospheric conditions  affect aircraft performance.  

Once the aircraft is stabilized at a constant airspeed and pitch  attitude, the primary flight instrument for pitch will be the ASI  and the primary bank instrument will be the heading indicator.  The primary power instrument will be the tachometer or the  manifold pressure gauge depending on the aircraft type. If the  pitch attitude is correct, the airspeed should slowly decrease to  the desired speed. If there is any variation in airspeed, make  small pitch changes until the aircraft is stabilized at the desired  speed. Any change in airspeed requires a trim adjustment.  

# Constant Airspeed Climb from Established Airspeed  

In order to enter a constant airspeed climb, first complete the  airspeed reduction from cruise airspeed to climb airspeed.  Maintain straight-and-level flight as the airspeed is reduced.  The entry to the climb is similar to the entry from cruise  airspeed with the exception that the power must be increased  when the pitch attitude is raised.  [Figure 7-64]  Power added  after the pitch change shows a decrease in airspeed due to  the increased drag encountered. Power added prior to a pitch  change causes the airspeed to increase due to the excess thrust.  

# Constant Rate Climbs  

Constant rate climbs are very similar to the constant airspeed  climbs in the way the entry is made. As power is added,  smoothly apply elevator pressure to raise the yellow chevron  

![](images/2acac9cde9678a7e8253a3e632d35234362aaa855637a4a3f144f6cf00f43e33.jpg)

to the desired pitch attitude that equates to the desired vertical  speed rate. The primary instrument for pitch during the initial  portion of the maneuver is the ASI until the vertical speed  rate stabilizes and then the VSI tape becomes primary. The  ASI then becomes the primary instrument for power. If any  deviation from the desired vertical speed is noted, small  pitch changes will be required in order to achieve the desired  vertical speed.  [Figure 7-65]  

When making changes to compensate for deviations in  performance, pitch, and power, pilot inputs need to be  coordinated to maintain a stable flight attitude. For instance,  if the vertical speed is lower than desired but the airspeed  is correct, an increase in pitch momentarily increases the  vertical speed. However, the increased drag quickly starts  to degrade the airspeed if no increase in power is made. A  change to any one variable mandates a coordinated change  in the other.  

Conversely, if the airspeed is low and the pitch is high, a  reduction in the pitch attitude alone may solve the problem.  Lower the nose of the aircraft very slightly to see if a power  reduction is necessary. Being familiar with the pitch and  power settings for the aircraft aids in achieving precise  attitude instrument flying.  

# Leveling Off  

Leveling off from a climb requires a reduction in the pitch  prior to reaching the desired altitude. If no change in pitch  is made until reaching the desired altitude, the momentum  of the aircraft causes the aircraft to continue past the desired  altitude throughout the transition to a level pitch attitude. The  amount of lead to be applied depends on the vertical speed  rate. A higher vertical speed requires a larger lead for level  off. A good rule of thumb to utilize is to lead the level off  by 10 percent of the vertical speed rate   $1{,}000~\mathrm{fpm}\div10=$  100 feet lead).  

To level off at the desired altitude, refer to the attitude display  and apply smooth forward elevator pressure toward the desired  level pitch attitude while monitoring the VSI and altimeter  tapes. The rates should start to slow and airspeed should  begin to increase. Maintain the climb power setting until the  airspeed approaches the desired cruise airspeed. Continue to  monitor the altimeter to maintain the desired altitude as the  airspeed increases. Prior to reaching the cruise airspeed, the  power must be reduced to avoid overshooting the desired  speed. The amount of lead time that is required depends on  the speed at which the aircraft accelerates. Utilization of the  airspeed trend indicator can assist by showing how quickly  the aircraft will arrive at the desired speed.  

![](images/256c0b268c05f57b88a2996824400e4f45a0c1eb1e5c90c2f28ec90e9cdf256d.jpg)  
Figure 7-65.  Constant rate climbs.  

To level off at climbing airspeed, lower the nose to the  appropriate pitch attitude for level flight with a simultaneous  reduction in power to a setting that maintains the desired  speed. With a coordinated reduction in pitch and power, there  should be no change in the airspeed.  

# Descents  

Descending flight can be accomplished at various airspeeds  and pitch attitudes by reducing power, lowering the nose  to a pitch attitude lower than the level flight attitude, or  adding drag. Once any of these changes have been made, the  airspeed eventually stabilizes During this transitional phase,  the only instrument that displays an accurate indication of  pitch is the attitude indicator. Without the use of the attitude  indicator (such as in partial panel flight), the ASI tape, the  VSI tape, and the altimeter tape shows changing values until  the aircraft stabilizes at a constant airspeed and constant rate  of descent. The altimeter tape continues to show a descent.  Hold pitch constant and allow the aircraft to stabilize. During  any change in attitude or airspeed, continuous application of  trim is required to eliminate any control pressures that need  to be applied to the control yoke. An increase in the scan rate  during the transition is important since changes are being  made to the aircraft flightpath and speed.  [Figure 7-66]  

# Entry  

Descents can be accomplished with a constant rate, constant  airspeed, or a combination. The following method can  accomplish any of these with or without an attitude indicator.  Reduce the power to allow the aircraft to decelerate to the  desired airspeed while maintaining straight-and-level flight.  As the aircraft approaches the desired airspeed, reduce the  

![](images/6d27fd6a39c1a906431458d980a18fe3d36e8435e4ca0048d58b9a22171d2763.jpg)  
Figure 7-66.  The top image illustrates a reduction of power and descending at 500 fpm to an altitude of 5,000 feet. The bottom image  illustrates an increase in power and the initiation of leveling off.  

power to a predetermined value. The airspeed continues to  decrease below the desired airspeed unless a simultaneous  reduction in pitch is performed. The primary instrument  for pitch is the ASI tape. If any deviation from the desired  speed is noted, make small pitch corrections by referencing  the attitude indicator and validate the changes made with the  airspeed tape. Utilize the airspeed trend indicator to judge  if the airspeed is increasing and at what rate. Remember to  trim off any control pressures.  

The entry procedure for a constant rate descent is the same  except the primary instrument for pitch is the VSI tape. The  primary instrument for power is the ASI. When performing  a constant rate descent while maintaining a specific airspeed,  coordinated use of pitch and power is required. Any change  in pitch directly affects the airspeed. Conversely, any change  in airspeed has a direct impact on vertical speed as long as  the pitch is being held constant.  

# Leveling Off  

When leveling off from a descent with the intention of  returning to cruise airspeed, first start by increasing the  power to cruise prior to increasing the pitch back toward  the level flight attitude. A technique used to determine  how soon to start the level off is to lead the level off by an  altitude corresponding to 10 percent of the rate of descent.  For example, if the aircraft is descending at  $1{,}000\,\mathrm{fpm}$  , start  the level off 100 feet above the level off altitude. If the pitch  attitude change is started late, there is a tendency to overshoot  the desired altitude unless the pitch change is made with  a rapid movement. Avoid making any rapid changes that  could lead to control issues or spatial disorientation. Once  in level pitch attitude, allow the aircraft to accelerate to the  desired speed. Monitor the performance on the airspeed and  altitude tapes. Make adjustments to the power in order to  correct any deviations in the airspeed. Verify that the aircraft  is maintaining level flight by cross-checking the altimeter  tape. If deviations are noticed, make an appropriate smooth  pitch change in order to arrive back at desired altitude. Any  change in pitch requires a smooth coordinated change to the  power setting. Monitor the airspeed in order to maintain the  desired cruise airspeed.  

To level off at a constant airspeed, the pilot must again  determine when to start to increase the pitch attitude toward  the level attitude. If pitch is the only item that is changing,  airspeed varies due to the increase in drag as the aircraft’s  pitch increases. A smooth coordinated increase in power  needs to be made to a predetermined value in order to  maintain speed. Trim the aircraft to relieve any control  pressure that may have to be applied.  

# Common Errors in Straight Climbs and Descents  

Climbing and descending errors usually result from but are  not limited to the following errors:  

1.	 Overcontrolling pitch on beginning the climb. Aircraft  familiarization is the key to achieving precise attitude  instrument flying. Until the pilot becomes familiar with  the pitch attitudes associated with specific airspeeds,  the pilot must make corrections to the initial pitch  settings. Changes do not produce instantaneous and  stabilized results; patience must be maintained while  the new speeds and vertical speed rates stabilize. Avoid  the temptations to make a change and then rush into  making another change until the first one is validated.  Small changes produce more expeditious results and  allow for a more stabilized flightpath. Large changes  to pitch and power are more difficult to control and can  further complicate the recovery process.  

2.	 Failure to increase the rate of instrument cross-check.  Any time a pitch or power change is made, an increase  in the rate a pilot cross-checks the instrument is  required. A slow cross-check can lead to deviations  in other flight attitudes.  

3.	 Failure to maintain new pitch attitudes. Once a  pitch change is made to correct for a deviation, that  pitch attitude must be maintained until the change  is validated. Utilize trim to assist in maintaining the  new pitch attitude. If the pitch is allowed to change,  it is impossible to validate whether the initial pitch  change was sufficient to correct the deviation. The  continuous changing of the pitch attitude delays the  recovery process.  

4.	 Failure to utilize effective trim techniques. If control  pressures have to be held by the pilot, validation of the  initial correction is impossible if the pitch is allowed to  vary. Pilots have the tendency to either apply or relax  additional control pressures when manually holding  pitch attitudes. Trim allows the pilot to fly without  holding pressure on the control yoke.  

5.	 Failure to learn and utilize proper power settings.  Any time a pilot is not familiar with an aircraft’s  specific pitch and power settings, or does not  utilize them, a change in flightpaths takes longer.  Learn pitch and power settings in order to expedite  changing the flightpath.  

6.	 Failure to cross-check both airspeed and vertical speed  prior to making adjustments to pitch and or power. It is  possible that a change in one may correct a deviation  in the other.  

7.	 Uncoordinated use of pitch and power during level  offs. During level offs, both pitch and power settings  need to be made in unison in order to achieve the  desired results. If pitch is increased before adding  power, additional drag is generated thereby reducing  airspeed below the desired value. 8.	 Failure to utilize supporting pitch instruments leads to  chasing the VSI. Always utilize the attitude indicator  as the control instrument on which to change the pitch. 9.	 Failure to determine a proper lead time for level off  from a climb or descent. Waiting too long can lead to  overshooting the altitude. 10.	 Ballooning—Failure to maintain forward control  pressure during level off as power is increased.  Additional lift is generated causing the nose of the  aircraft to pitch up.  

# Turns  

# Standard Rate Turns  

The previous sections have addressed flying straight-and- level as well as climbs and descents. However, attitude  instrument flying is not accomplished solely by flying  in a straight line. At some point, the aircraft needs to be  turned to maneuver along victor airways, global positioning  system (GPS) courses, and instrument approaches. The  key to instrument flying is smooth, controlled changes to  pitch and bank. Instrument flying should be a slow but  deliberate process that takes the pilot from departure airport  to destination airport without any radical flight maneuvers.  

A turn to specific heading should be made at standard rate.  Standard rate is defined as a turning rate of 3 degrees per  second, which yields a complete   $360^{\circ}$   turn in 2 minutes.  A turning rate of 3 degrees per second allows for a timely  heading change, as well as allowing the pilot sufficient time to  cross-check the flight instruments and avoid drastic changes  to the aerodynamic forces being exerted on the aircraft. At no  time should the aircraft be maneuvered faster than the pilot  is comfortable cross-checking the flight instruments. Most  autopilots are programmed to turn at standard rate.  

# Establishing A Standard Rate Turn  

In order to initiate a standard rate turn, approximate the  bank angle and then establish that bank angle on the attitude  indicator. A rule of thumb to determine the approximate angle  of bank is to use 15 percent of the true airspeed. A simple  way to determine this amount is to divide the airspeed by  10 and add one-half the result. For example, at 100 knots,  approximately   $15^{\circ}$   of bank is required   $(100/10=10\,+\,5=$  15); at 120 knots, approximately   $18^{\circ}$   of bank is needed for a  standard-rate turn. Cross-check the turn rate indicator, located  on the HSI, to determine if that bank angle is sufficient to  deliver a standard rate turn. Slight modifications may need  to be made to the bank angle in order to achieve the desired  performance. The primary bank instrument in this case is the  turn rate indicator since the goal is to achieve a standard rate  turn. The turn rate indicator is the only instrument that can  specifically indicate a standard rate turn. The attitude indicator  is used only to establish a bank angle (control instrument) but  can be utilized as a supporting instrument by cross-checking  the bank angle to determine if the bank is greater or less than  what was calculated.  

As the aircraft rolls into the bank, the vertical component  of lift begins to decrease.  [Figure 7-67]  As this happens,  additional lift must be generated to maintain level flight.  Apply aft control pressure on the yoke sufficient to stop any  altitude loss trend. With the increase in lift that needs to be  generated, additional induced drag is also generated. This  additional drag causes the aircraft to start to decelerate. To  counteract this, apply additional thrust by adding power to the  power lever. Once altitude and airspeed is being maintained,  utilize the trim wheel to eliminate any control forces that need  to be held on the control column.  

When rolling out from a standard rate turn, the pilot needs  to utilize coordinated aileron and rudder and roll-out to a  wings level attitude utilizing smooth control inputs. The  roll-out rate should be the same as the roll-in rate in order to  estimate the lead necessary to arrive at the desired heading  without over- or undershooting.  

During the transition from the turn back to straight flight, the  attitude indicator becomes the primary instrument for bank.  Once the wings are level, the heading indicator becomes  the primary instrument for bank. As bank decreases, the  vertical component increases if the pitch attitude is not  decreased sufficiently to maintain level flight. An aggressive  cross-check keeps the altimeter stationary if forward control  pressure is applied to the control column. As the bank angle is  decreased, the pitch attitude should be decreased accordingly  in order to arrive at the level pitch attitude when the aircraft  reaches zero bank. Remember to utilize the trim wheel to  eliminate any excess control forces that would otherwise  need to be held.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 One common error associated with standard rate turns  is due to pilot inability to hold the appropriate bank  angle that equates to a standard rate. The primary bank  instrument during the turn is the turn rate indicator;  however, the bank angle varies slightly. With an  

![](images/89868eb042e7c0813081a5f2cc1d423460830fc139ecda32c8ed8afaec2031fd.jpg)  
Figure 7-67.  Standard rate turn—constant airspeed.  

aggressive cross-check, a pilot should be able to  minimize errors arising from over- or underbanking.  

2.	 Another error normally encountered during standard  rate turns is inefficient or lack of adequate cross- checking. Pilots need to establish an aggressive  cross-check in order to detect and eliminate all  deviations from altitude, airspeed, and bank angle  during a maneuver.  

3.	 Fixation is a major error associated with attitude  instrument flying in general. Pilots training for their  instrument rating tend to focus on what they perceive  to be the most important task at hand and abandon  their cross-check by applying all of their attention to  the turn rate indicator. A modified radial scan works  well to provide the pilot with adequate scanning of all  instrumentation during the maneuver.  

# Turns to Predetermined Headings  

Turning the aircraft is one of the most basic maneuvers that a  pilot learns during initial flight training. Learning to control  the aircraft, maintaining coordination, and smoothly rolling  out on a desired heading are all keys to proficient attitude  instrument flying.  

EFDs allow the pilot to better utilize all instrumentation during  all phases of attitude instrument flying by consolidating all  traditional instrumentation onto the PFD. The increased size  of the attitude indicator, which stretches the entire width of  the PFD, allows the pilot to maintain better pitch control  while the introduction of the turn rate indicator positioned  directly on the compass rose aids the pilot in determining  when to begin a roll-out for the desired heading.  

When determining what bank angle to utilize when making a  heading change, a general rule states that for a small heading  change, do not use a bank angle that is greater than the total  number of degrees of change needed. For instance, if a  heading change of   $20^{\circ}$   is needed, a bank angle of not more  than  $20^{\circ}$   is required. Another rule of thumb that better defines  the bank angle is half the total number of degrees of heading  change required, but never greater than standard rate. The  exact bank angle that equates to a standard rate turn varies  due to true airspeed.  

With this in mind and the angle of bank calculated, the next step  is determining when to start the roll-out process. For example:  

An aircraft begins a turn from a heading of  $030^{\circ}$   to a heading  of   $120^{\circ}$  . With the given airspeed, a standard rate turn has  yielded a   $15^{\circ}$   bank. The pilot wants to begin a smooth  coordinated roll-out to the desired heading when the heading  indicator displays approximately   $112^{\circ}$  . The necessary  calculations are:  

$15^{\circ}$   bank (standard rate)  $\div2=7.5^{\circ}$   $120^{\circ}-7.5^{\circ}=112.5^{\circ}$  

By utilizing this technique, the pilot is better able to judge  if any modifications need to be made to the amount of lead  once the amount of over- or undershooting is established.  

# Timed Turns  

Timed turns to headings are performed in the same fashion  with an EFD as with an analog equipped aircraft. The  instrumentation used to perform this maneuver is the turn rate  indicator as well as the clock. The purpose of this maneuver  is to allow the pilot to gain proficiency in scanning as well  as to further develop the pilot’s ability to control the aircraft  without standard instrumentation.  

Timed turns become essential when controlling the aircraft  with a loss of the heading indicator. This may become  necessary due to a loss of the AHRS unit or the magnetometer.  In any case, the magnetic compass is still available for  navigation. The reason for timed turns instead of magnetic  compass turns is the simplicity of the maneuver. Magnetic  compass turns require the pilot to take into account various  errors associated with the compass; timed turns do not.  

Prior to initiating a turn, determine if the standard rate indication  on the turn rate indicator actually delivers a 3 degrees per  second turn. To accomplish this, a calibration must be made.  Establish a turn in either direction at the indicated standard  rate. Start the digital timer as the compass rolls past a cardinal  heading. Stop the timer once the compass card rolls through  another cardinal heading. Roll wings level and compute the  rate of turn. If the turn rate indicator is calibrated and indicating  correctly,  $90^{\circ}$   of heading change should take 30 seconds. If  the time taken to change heading by  $90^{\circ}$   is more or less than  30 seconds, then a deflection above or below the standard rate  line needs to be made to compensate for the difference. Once  the calibration has been completed in one direction, proceed  to the opposite direction. When both directions have been  calibrated, apply the calibrated calculations to all timed turns.  

In order to accomplish a timed turn, the amount of heading  change needs to be established. For a change in heading from   $120^{\circ}$   to a heading of  $360^{\circ}$  , the pilot calculates the difference  and divides that number by 3. In this case,   $120^{\circ}$   divided by   $3^{\circ}$   per second equals 40 seconds. This means that it would  take 40 seconds for an aircraft to change heading  $120^{\circ}$   if that  aircraft were held in a perfect standard rate turn. Timing for  the maneuver should start as the aircraft begins rolling into  the standard rate turn. Monitor all flight instruments during  this maneuver. The primary pitch instrument is the altimeter.  The primary power instrument is the ASI and the primary  bank instrument is the turn rate indicator.  

Once the calculated time expires, start a smooth coordinated  roll-out. As long as the pilot utilizes the same rate of roll-in as  roll-out, the time it takes for both will not need to be included  in the calculations. With practice, the pilot should level the  wings on the desired heading. If any deviation has occurred,  make small corrections to establish the correct heading.  

# Compass Turns  

The magnetic compass is the only instrument that requires  no other source of power for operation. In the event of an  AHRS or magnetometer failure, the magnetic compass is  the instrument the pilot uses to determine aircraft heading.  For a more detailed explanation on the use of the magnetic  compass, see page 7-21.  

# Steep Turns  

For the purpose of instrument flight training, a steep turn is  defined as any turn in excess of standard rate. A standard  rate turn is defined as 3 degrees per second. The bank angle  that equates to a turn rate of 3 degrees per second varies  according to airspeed. As airspeed increases, the bank angle  must be increased. The exact bank angle that equates to a  standard rate turn is unimportant. Normal standard rate turn  bank angles range from   $10^{\circ}$   to  $20^{\circ}$  . The goal of training in  steep turn maneuvers is pilot proficiency in controlling the  aircraft with excessive bank angles.  

Training in excessive bank angles challenges the pilot in  honing cross-checking skills and improves altitude control  throughout a wider range of flight attitudes. Although the  current instrument flight check practical test standards (PTS)  do not call for a demonstration of steep turns on the certification  check flight, this does not eliminate the need for the instrument  pilot-in-training to demonstrate proficiency to an instructor.  

Training in steep turns teaches the pilot to recognize and to  adapt to rapidly changing aerodynamic forces that necessitate  an increase in the rate of cross-checking all flight instruments.  The procedures for entering, maintaining, and exiting a  steep turn are the same as for shallower turns. Proficiency in  instrument cross-check and interpretation is increased due to  the higher aerodynamic forces and increased speed at which  the forces are changing.  

Performing the Maneuver  

To enter a steep turn to the left, roll into a coordinated  $45^{\circ}$  bank turn to the left. An advantage that glass panel displays  have over analog instrumentation is a  $45^{\circ}$   bank indication on  the roll scale. This additional index on the roll scale allows  the pilot to precisely roll into the desired bank angle instead  of having to approximate it as is necessary with analog  instrumentation.  [Figure 7-68]  

![](images/5f51e46d2538af4b4142e68ec5d4d17d358733bb123f0b3ac7cb087ea29f0e83.jpg)  
Figure 7-68.  Steep left turn.  

As soon as the bank angle increases from level flight, the  vertical component of lift begins to decrease. If the vertical  component of lift is allowed to continue to decrease, a  pronounced loss of altitude is indicated on the altimeter  along with the VSI tape, as well as the altitude trend  indicator. Additionally, the airspeed begins to increase due  to the lowered pitch attitude. It is very important to have  a comprehensive scan developed prior to training in steep  turns. Utilization of all of the trend indicators, as well the  VSI, altimeter, and ASI, is essential in learning to fly steep  turns by reference to instruments alone.  

In order to avoid a loss of altitude, the pilot begins to slowly  increase back pressure on the control yoke in order to increase  the pitch attitude. The pitch change required is usually no  more than 3 degrees to 5 degrees, depending on the type of  aircraft. As the pilot increases back pressure, the angle of  attack increases, thus increasing the vertical component of  lift. When a deviation in altitude is indicated, proper control  force corrections need to be made. During initial training of  steep turns, pilots have a tendency to overbank. Over banking  is when the bank angle exceeds   $50^{\circ}$  . As the outboard wing  begins to travel faster through the air, it begins to generate a  greater and greater differential in lift compared to the inboard  wing. As the bank angle continues to progress more and  more steeply past  $45^{\circ}$  , the two components of lift (vertical  and horizontal) become inversely proportionate.  

Once the angle has exceeded  $45^{\circ}$  , the horizontal component  of lift is now the greater force. If altitude should continue to  decrease and the pilot only applies back yoke pressure, the  aircraft’s turn radius begins to tighten due to the increased  horizontal force. If aft control pressure continues to increase,  there comes a point where the loss of the vertical component  of lift and aerodynamic wing loading prohibits the nose of  the aircraft from being raised. Any increase in pitch only  tightens the turning radius.  

The key to successfully performing a steep turn by reference  to instruments alone is the thorough understanding of the  aerodynamics involved, as well as a quick and reliable cross- check. The pilot should utilize the trim to avoid holding  control forces for any period of time. With time and practice,  a flight instructor can demonstrate how to successfully fly  steep turns with and without the use of trim. Once the aircraft  is trimmed for the maneuver, accomplishing the maneuver is  virtually a hands-off effort. This allows additional time for  cross-checking and interpreting the instruments.  

It is imperative when correcting for a deviation in altitude,  that the pilot modify the bank angle  $\pm5^{\circ}$   in order to vary the  vertical component of lift, not just adjust back pressure. These  two actions should be accomplished simultaneously.  

During the recovery from steep turns to straight-and-level  flight, aft control forces must be varied with the power control  to arrive back at entry altitude, heading and airspeed.  

# Steps:  

1.	 Perform clearing turns. 2.	 Roll left into a  $45^{\circ}$   bank turn and immediately begin to  increase the pitch attitude by approximately  $3^{\circ}$   to  $5^{\circ}$  . 3.	 As the bank rolls past  $30^{\circ}$  , increase power to maintain  the entry airspeed. 4.	 Apply trim to eliminate any aft control wheel forces. 5.	 Begin rolling out of the steep turn approximately  $20^{\circ}$    prior to the desired heading. 6.	 Apply forward control pressure and place the pitch  attitude in the level cruise pitch attitude. 7.	 Reduce power to the entry power setting to maintain  the desired airspeed. 8.	 Re-trim the aircraft as soon as practical or continue  into a right hand steep turn and continue from step 3.  

9.	 Once the maneuver is complete, establish cruise flight  and accomplish all appropriate checklist items.  

# Unusual Attitude Recovery Protection  

Unusual attitudes are some of the most hazardous situations  for a pilot to be in. Without proper recovery training  on instrument interpretation and aircraft control, a pilot  can quickly aggravate an abnormal flight attitude into a  potentially fatal accident.  

Analog gauges require the pilot to scan between instruments  to deduce the aircraft attitude. Individually, these gauges lack  the necessary information needed for a successful recovery.  

EFDs have additional features to aid in recognition and  recovery from unusual flight attitudes.  The PFD displays  all the flight instruments on one screen. Each instrument is  superimposed over a full-screen representation of the attitude  indicator. With this configuration, the pilot no longer needs  to transition from one instrument to another.  

The new unusual attitude recovery protection allows the  pilot to be able to quickly determine the aircraft’s attitude  and make a safe, proper, and prompt recovery. Situational  awareness is increased by the introduction of the large  full-width artificial horizon depicted on the PFD. This now  allows for the attitude indicator to be in view during all  portions of the scan.  

One problem with analog gauges is that the attitude indicator  displays a complete blue or brown segment when the pitch  attitude is increased toward   $90^{\circ}$   nose-up or nose-down.  

With the EFDs, the attitude indicator is designed to retain  a portion of both sky and land representation at all times.  This improvement allows the pilot to always know the  quickest way to return to the horizon. Situational awareness  is greatly increased.  

NOTE: The horizon line starts moving downward at  approximately   $47^{\circ}$   pitch up. From this point on, the brown  segment remains visible to show the pilot the quickest way  to return to the level pitch attitude.  [Figure 7-69]  

NOTE: The horizon line starts moving upward at  approximately   $27^{\circ}$   pitch down. From this point on, the blue  segment remains visible to show the pilot the quickest way  to return to the level pitch attitude.  [Figure 7-70]  

It is imperative to understand that the white line on the  attitude indicator is the horizon line. The break between the  blue and brown symbols is only a reference and should not  be thought of as the artificial horizon.  

Another important advancement is the development of the  unusual attitude recovery protection that is built into the PFD  software and made capable by the AHRS. In the case of a nose- high unusual attitude, the unusual attitude recovery protection  displays red chevrons that point back to the horizon line. These

Figure 7-70.  Horizon line starts moving upward at  $27^{\circ}$  . Note that the blue sky remains visible at  $I7^{\circ}$   nose-down. Figure 5-27.   Horizon line starts moving upward at approximately 27 deg pitch down.  

chevrons are positioned at   $50^{\circ}$   up on the attitude indicator.  The chevrons appear when the aircraft approaches a nose-high  attitude of  $30^{\circ}$  . The software automatically declutters the PFD  leaving only airspeed, heading, attitude, altimeter, VSI tape,  and the trend vectors. The decluttered information reappears  when the pitch attitude falls below   $25^{\circ}$  .  

For nose-low unusual attitudes, the chevrons are displayed  when the pitch exceeds  $15^{\circ}$   nose-down. If the pitch continues  to decrease, the unusual attitude recovery protection de- clutters the screen at   $20^{\circ}$   nose-down. The decluttered  information reappears when the pitch increases above  $15^{\circ}$  .  

Additionally, there are bank limits that trigger the unusual  attitude protection.  If the aircraft’s bank increases beyond   $60^{\circ}$  , a continuation of the roll index occurs to indicate the  shortest direction to roll the wings back to level.  At  $65^{\circ}$  , the  PFD de-clutters. All information reappears when the bank  decreases below  $60^{\circ}$  .  

In  Figure 7-71 , the aircraft has rolled past  $60^{\circ}$  . Observe the  white line that continues from the end of the bank index.  This line appears to indicate the shortest distance back to  wings level.  

When experiencing a failure of the AHRS unit, all unusual  attitude protection is lost.  The failure of the AHRS results  in the loss of all heading and attitude indications on the PFD.  In addition, all modes of the autopilot, except for roll and  altitude hold, are lost.  

The following picture series represents how important this  technology is in increasing situational awareness, and how  critical it is in improving safety.  

Figure 7-72  shows the unusual attitude protection with valid  AHRS and air data computer (ADC) inputs. The bright red  chevrons pointing down to the horizon indicate a nose-high  unusual attitude that can be easily recognized and corrected.  

NOTE: The red chevrons point back to the level pitch attitude.  The trend indicators show where the airspeed and altitude will  be in 6 seconds. The trend indicator on the heading indicator  shows which direction the aircraft is turning. The slip/skid  indicator clearly shows if the aircraft is coordinated. This  information helps the pilot determine which type of unusual  attitude the aircraft has taken.  

Now look at  Figure 7-73 . The display shows the same  airspeed as the picture above; however, the AHRS unit has  failed. The altimeter and the VSI tape are the only clear  indications that the aircraft is in a nose-high attitude. The  one key instrument that is no longer present is the slip/skid  indicator. There is not a standby turn coordinator installed  in the aircraft for the pilot to reference.  

The magnetic compass indicates a heading is being  maintained; however, it is not as useful as a turn coordinator  or slip/skid indicator.

Figure 7-73.  AHRS unit failed.  

Figure 7-74  depicts an AHRS and ADC failure.  In this failure  scenario, there are no indications of the aircraft’s attitude. The  manufacturer recommends turning on the autopilot, which is  simply a wing leveler.  

With a failure of the primary instrumentation on the PFD, the  only references available are the standby instruments. The  standby instrumentation consists of an analog ASI, attitude  indicator, altimeter, and magnetic compass. There is no  standby turn coordinator installed.  

In extreme nose-high or nose-low pitch attitudes, as well  as high bank angles, the analog attitude indicator has the  potential to tumble, rendering it unusable.  

# Autopilot Usage  

The autopilot is equipped with inputs from a turn coordinator  installed behind the MFD screen. This turn coordinator is  installed solely for the use of the autopilot to facilitate the  roll mode, which is simply a wing leveler. This protection  is always available, barring a failure of the turn coordinator  (to aid the pilot if the aircraft attains an unusual attitude).  

NOTE: The pilot is not able to gain access to the turn  coordinator. This instrument is installed behind the MFD  panel.  [Figure 7-75]  

Most EFD equipped aircraft are coming from the factory with  autopilots installed. However, the purchaser of the aircraft  can specify if an autopilot is to be installed. Extreme caution  should be utilized when flying an EFD equipped aircraft  without an autopilot in IMC with an AHRS and ADC failure.  

The autopilot should be utilized to reduce workload, which  affords the pilot more time to monitor the flight. Utilization  of the autopilot also decreases the chances of entry into an  unusual attitude.  

Flying an EFD-equipped aircraft without the use of an autopilot  has been shown to increase workload and decrease situational  awareness for pilots first learning to flying the new system.  

# Common Errors Leading to Unusual Attitudes  

The following errors have the potential to disrupt a pilot’s  situational awareness and lead to unusual attitudes.  

1.	 Improper trimming techniques. A failure to keep the  aircraft trimmed for level flight at all times can turn  a momentary distraction into an emergency situation  if the pilot stops cross-checking. 2.	 Poor crew resource management (CRM) skills. Failure  to perform all single-pilot resource management  duties efficiently. A major cause of CRM-related  accidents comes from the failure of the pilot to  maintain an organized flight deck. Items that are  being utilized for the flight portion should be neatly  arranged for easy access. A disorganized flight deck  can lead to a distraction that causes the pilot to cease  cross-checking the instruments long enough to enter  an unusual attitude.  

![](images/5628c07e589ac87563055da7f77ae0b5a82e885b108b662c3490b47ec92ab292.jpg)

Figure 7-75.  This autopilot requires roll information from a turn coordinator.  

3.	 Fixation is displayed when a pilot focuses far too  much attention on one instrument because he or  she perceives something is wrong or a deviation is  occurring. It is important for the instrument pilot to  remember that a cross-check of several instruments  for corroboration is more valuable than checking a  single instrument. 4.	 Attempting to recover by sensory sensations other  than sight. Recovery by instinct almost always leads  to erroneous corrections due to the illusions that are  prevalent during instrument flight. 5.	 Failure to practice basic attitude instrument flying.  When a pilot does not fly instrument approach  procedures or even basic attitude instrument flying  maneuvers for long periods of time, skill levels  diminish. Pilots should avoid flying in IMC if they are  not proficient. They should seek a qualified instructor to  receive additional instruction prior to entry into IMC.  

# Instrument Takeoff  

The reason for learning to fly by reference to instruments  alone is to expand a pilot’s abilities to operate an aircraft  in visibility less than VFR. Another valuable maneuver  to learn is the instrument takeoff. This maneuver requires  the pilot to maneuver the aircraft during the takeoff roll by  reference to flight instruments alone with no outside visual  reference. With practice, this maneuver becomes as routine  as a standard rate turn.  

The reason behind practicing instrument takeoffs is to reduce  the disorientation that can occur during the transitional phase  of quickly moving the eyes from the outside references inside  to the flight instruments.  

One EFD system currently offers what is trademarked as  synthetic vision. Synthetic vision is a three-dimensional  computer-generated representation of the terrain that lies  ahead of the aircraft. The display shows runways as well  as a depiction of the terrain features based on a GPS terrain  database. Similar to a video game, the display generates a  runway the pilot can maneuver down in order to maintain  directional control. As long as the pilot tracks down the  computer-generated runway, the aircraft remains aligned  with the actual runway.  

Not all EFD systems have such an advanced visioning system.  With all other systems, the pilot needs to revert to the standard  procedures for instrument takeoffs. Each aircraft may require  a modification to the maneuver; therefore, always obtain  training on any new equipment to be used.  

In order to accomplish an instrument takeoff, the aircraft  needs to be maneuvered on the centerline of the runway  facing the direction of departure with the nose or tail wheel  straight. Assistance from the instructor may be necessary  if the pilot has been taxiing while wearing a view limiting  device. Lock the tail wheel, if so equipped, and hold the  brakes firmly to prevent the aircraft from creeping. Cross- check the heading indicator on the PFD with the magnetic  compass and adjust for any deviations noted on the compass  card. Set the heading to the nearest 5 degree mark closest  to the runway heading. This allows the pilot to quickly  detect any deviations from the desired heading and allows  prompt corrective actions during the takeoff roll. Using the  omnibearing select (OBS) mode on the GPS, rotate the OBS  selector until the needle points to the runway heading. This  adds additional situational awareness during the takeoff roll.  Smoothly apply power to generate sufficient rudder authority  for directional control. Release the brakes and continue to  advance the power to the takeoff setting.  

As soon as the brakes are released, any deviation in heading  needs to be corrected immediately. Avoid using brakes to  control direction as this increases the takeoff roll, as well as  provides the potential of overcontrolling the aircraft.  

Continuously cross-check the ASI and the heading indicator  as the aircraft accelerates. As the aircraft approaches 15-25  knots below the rotation speed, smoothly apply aft elevator  pressure to increase the pitch attitude to the desired takeoff  attitude (approximately   $7^{\circ}$   for most small airplanes). With  the pitch attitude held constant, continue to cross-check the  flight instruments and allow the aircraft to fly off of the  runway. Do not pull the aircraft off of the runway. Pulling  the aircraft off of the runway imposes left turning tendencies  due to P-Factor, which will yaw the aircraft to the left and  destabilize the takeoff.  

Maintain the desired pitch and bank attitudes by referencing  the attitude indicator and cross-check the VSI tape for an  indication of a positive rate of climb. Take note of the magenta  6-second altimeter trend indicator. The trend should show  positive. Barring turbulence, all trend indications should  be stabilized. The airspeed trend indicator should not be  visible at this point if the airspeed is being held constant. An  activation of the airspeed trend indicator shows that the pitch  attitude is not being held at the desired value and, therefore,  the airspeed is changing. The desired performance is to be  climbing at a constant airspeed and vertical speed rate. Use  the ASI as the primary instrument for the pitch indication.  

Once the aircraft has reached a safe altitude (approximately  100 feet for insufficient runway available for landing should  an engine failure occur) retract the landing gear and flaps while  referencing the ASI and attitude indicator to maintain the  desired pitch. As the configuration is changed, an increase in  aft control pressure is needed in order to maintain the desired  pitch attitude. Smoothly increase the aft control pressure to  compensate for the change in configuration. Anticipate the  changes and increase the rate of cross-check. The airspeed tape  and altitude tape increases while the VSI tape is held constant.  Allow the aircraft to accelerate to the desired climb speed.  Once the desired climb speed is reached, reduce the power to  the climb power setting as printed in the POH/AFM. Trim the  aircraft to eliminate any control pressures.  

# Common Errors in Instrument Takeoffs  

Common errors associated with the instrument takeoff  include, but are not limited to, the following:  

1.	 Failure to perform an adequate flight deck check  before the takeoff. Pilots have attempted instrument  takeoff with inoperative airspeed indicators (pitot  tube obstructed), controls locked, and numerous  other oversights due to haste or carelessness. It is  imperative to cross-check the ASI as soon as possible.  No airspeed is indicated until 20 knots of true airspeed  is generated in some systems. 2.	 Improper alignment on the runway. This may result  from improper brake applications, allowing the  airplane to creep after alignment, or from alignment  with the nosewheel or tailwheel cocked. In any case,  the result is a built-in directional control problem as  the takeoff starts. 3.	 Improper application of power. Abrupt applications  of power complicate directional control. Power  should be applied in a smooth and continuous  manner to arrive at the takeoff power setting within  approximately 3 seconds. 4.	 Improper use of brakes. Incorrect seat or rudder pedal  adjustment, with feet in an uncomfortable position,  frequently causes inadvertent application of brakes  and excessive heading changes. 5.	 Overcontrolling rudder pedals. This fault may be  caused by late recognition of heading changes, tension  on the controls, misinterpretation of the heading  indicator (and correcting in the wrong direction),  failure to appreciate changing effectiveness of rudder  control as the aircraft accelerates, and other factors. If  heading changes are observed and corrected instantly  with small movement of the rudder pedals, swerving  tendencies can be reduced.  

6.	 Failure to maintain attitude after becoming airborne.  If the pilot reacts to seat-of-the-pants sensations when  the airplane lifts off, pitch control is guesswork.  The pilot may either allow excessive pitch or apply  excessive forward-elevator pressure, depending on  the reaction to trim changes.  7.	 Inadequate cross-check. Fixations are likely during the  trim changes, attitude changes, gear and flap retractions,  and power changes. Once an instrument or a control  input is applied, continue the cross-check and note the  effect control during the next cross-check sequence. 8.	 Inadequate interpretation of instruments. Failure  to understand instrument indications immediately  indicates that further study of the maneuver is necessary.  

# Basic Instrument Flight Patterns  

After attaining a reasonable degree of proficiency in basic  maneuvers, apply these skills to the various combinations  of individual maneuvers. The practice flight patterns,  beginning on page 7-30, are directly applicable to operational  instrument flying.  

# Helicopter Attitude  Instrument Flying  

# Introduction  

Attitude instrument flying in helicopters is essentially visual  flying with the flight instruments substituted for the various  reference points on the helicopter and the natural horizon.  Control changes, required to produce a given attitude by  reference to instruments, are identical to those used in  helicopter visual flight rules (VFR) flight, and pilot thought  processes are the same. Basic instrument training is intended to  be a building block toward attaining an instrument rating.  

# Flight Instruments  

When flying a helicopter with reference to the flight  instruments, proper instrument interpretation is the basis  for aircraft control. Skill, in part, depends on understanding  how a particular instrument or system functions, including  its indications and limitations (see Chapter 5, Flight  Instruments). With this knowledge, a pilot can quickly  interpret an instrument indication and translate that  information into a control response.  

# Instrument Flight  

To achieve smooth, positive control of the helicopter during  instrument flight, three fundamental skills must be developed.  They are instrument cross-check, instrument interpretation,  and aircraft control.  

# Instrument Cross-Check  

Cross-checking, sometimes referred to as scanning, is the  continuous and logical observation of instruments for attitude  and performance information. In attitude instrument flying,  an attitude is maintained by reference to the instruments,  which produces the desired result in performance. Due to  human error, instrument error, and helicopter performance  differences in various atmospheric and loading conditions,  it is difficult to establish an attitude and have performance  remain constant for a long period of time. These variables  make it necessary to constantly check the instruments and  make appropriate changes in the helicopter’s attitude. The  actual technique may vary depending on what instruments  are installed and where they are installed, as well as  pilot experience and proficiency level. This discussion  concentrates on the six basic flight instruments.  [Figure 8-1]  

At first, there may be a tendency to cross-check rapidly,  looking directly at the instruments without knowing exactly  what information is needed. However, with familiarity and  practice, the instrument cross-check reveals definite trends  during specific flight conditions. These trends help a pilot  control the helicopter as it makes a transition from one flight  condition to another.  

When full concentration is applied to a single instrument, a  problem called fixation is encountered. This results from a  natural human inclination to observe a specific instrument  carefully and accurately, often to the exclusion of other  instruments. Fixation on a single instrument usually results  in poor control. For example, while performing a turn, there  is a tendency to watch only the turn-and-slip indicator instead  of including other instruments in the cross-check. This  fixation on the turn-and-slip indicator often leads to a loss of  altitude through poor pitch-and-bank control. Look at each  

![](images/801d58d1eee7430866f3390237d854665a8e24d71693bb4eaea70dfa50c6f606.jpg)  
Figure 8-1.  A radial scan pattern of the flight instruments enables the helicopter pilot to fully comprehend the condition and direction  of the helicopter.  

instrument only long enough to understand the information  it presents, and then proceed to the next one. Similarly, too  much emphasis can be placed on a single instrument, instead  of relying on a combination of instruments necessary for  helicopter performance information. This differs from fixation  in that other instruments are included in a cross-check, but too  much attention is placed on one particular instrument.  

During performance of a maneuver, there is sometimes  a failure to anticipate significant instrument indications  following attitude changes. For example, during level off  from a climb or descent, a pilot may concentrate on pitch  control, while forgetting about heading or roll information.  This error, called omission, results in erratic control of  heading and bank.  

In spite of these common errors, most pilots can adapt well to  flight by instrument reference after instruction and practice.  Many find that they can control the helicopter more easily  and precisely by instruments.  

# Instrument Interpretation  

The flight instruments together give a picture of what is  happening. No one instrument is more important than the  next; however, during certain maneuvers or conditions,  those instruments that provide the most pertinent and useful  information are termed primary instruments. Those which  back up and supplement the primary instruments are termed  supporting instruments. For example, since the attitude  indicator is the only instrument that provides instant and  direct aircraft attitude information, it should be considered  primary during any change in pitch or bank attitude. After  the new attitude is established, other instruments become  primary, and the attitude indicator usually becomes the  supporting instrument.  

# Aircraft Control  

Controlling a helicopter is the result of accurately interpreting  the flight instruments and translating these readings  into correct control responses. Aircraft control involves  adjustment to pitch, bank, power, and trim in order to achieve  a desired flight path.  

Pitch attitude control is controlling the movement of  the helicopter about its lateral axis. After interpreting  the helicopter’s pitch attitude by reference to the pitch  instruments (attitude indicator, altimeter, airspeed  indicator, and vertical speed indicator (VSI)), cyclic control  adjustments are made to affect the desired pitch attitude. In  this chapter, the pitch attitudes depicted are approximate  and vary with different helicopters.  

Bank attitude control is controlling the angle made by the  lateral tilt of the rotor and the natural horizon or the movement  of the helicopter about its longitudinal axis. After interpreting  the helicopter’s bank instruments (attitude indicator, heading  indicator, and turn indicator), cyclic control adjustments are  made to attain the desired bank attitude.  

Power control is the application of collective pitch with  corresponding throttle control, where applicable. In straight- and-level flight, changes of collective pitch are made to  correct for altitude deviation if the error is more than 100  feet or the airspeed is off by more than 10 knots. If the error  is less than that amount, a pilot should use a slight cyclic  climb or descent.  

In order to fly a helicopter by reference to the instruments, it  is important to know the approximate power settings required  for a particular helicopter in various load configurations and  flight conditions.  

Trim, in helicopters, refers to the use of the cyclic centering  button, if the helicopter is so equipped, to relieve all  possible cyclic pressures. Trim also refers to the use of pedal  adjustment to center the ball of the turn indicator. Pedal trim  is required during all power changes.  

The proper adjustment of collective pitch and cyclic friction  helps a pilot relax during instrument flight. Friction should  be adjusted to minimize overcontrolling and to prevent  creeping, but not applied to such a degree that control  movement is limited. In addition, many helicopters equipped  for instrument flight contain stability augmentation systems  or an autopilot to help relieve pilot workload.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

Straight-and-level unaccelerated flight consists of maintaining  the desired altitude, heading, airspeed, and pedal trim.  

# Pitch Control  

The pitch attitude of a helicopter is the angular relation of  its longitudinal axis to the natural horizon. If available, the  attitude indicator is used to establish the desired pitch attitude.  In level flight, pitch attitude varies with airspeed and center of  gravity (CG). At a constant altitude and a stabilized airspeed,  the pitch attitude is approximately level.  [Figure 8-2]  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator gives a direct indication of the pitch  attitude of the helicopter. In visual flight, attain the desired  pitch attitude by using the cyclic to raise and lower the nose  

![](images/651443226982bb871ac698fb41c47f2c6fce9c2ec2cf77f016789d450c4c1c62.jpg)  
Figure 8-2.  The flight instruments for pitch control are the airspeed indicator, attitude indicator, altimeter, and vertical speed indicator .  

of the helicopter in relation to the natural horizon. During  instrument flight, follow exactly the same procedure in  raising or lowering the miniature aircraft in relation to the  horizon bar.  

There is some delay between control application and resultant  instrument change. This is the normal control lag in the  helicopter and should not be confused with instrument lag.  The attitude indicator may show small misrepresentations  of pitch attitude during maneuvers involving acceleration,  deceleration, or turns. This precession error can be detected  quickly by cross-checking the other pitch instruments.  

If the miniature aircraft is properly adjusted on the ground, it  may not require readjustment in flight. If the miniature aircraft  is not on the horizon bar after level off at normal cruising  airspeed, adjust it as necessary while maintaining level flight  with the other pitch instruments. Once the miniature aircraft  has been adjusted in level flight at normal cruising airspeed,  leave it unchanged so it gives an accurate picture of pitch  attitude at all times.  

When making initial pitch attitude corrections to maintain  altitude, the changes of attitude should be small and smoothly  applied. The initial movement of the horizon bar should not  exceed one bar width high or low.  [Figure 8-3]  If a further  adjustment is required, an additional correction of one- half bar normally corrects any deviation from the desired  altitude. This one-and-one-half bar correction is normally the  maximum pitch attitude correction from level flight attitude.  

After making the correction, cross-check the other pitch  instruments to determine whether the pitch attitude change  is sufficient. If additional correction is needed to return to  altitude, or if the airspeed varies more than 10 knots from  that desired, adjust the power.  

![](images/050bfc8d590669cb179b907e93118a57ca25cb3215bf29b787d944aa5344814c.jpg)  
Figure 8-3.  The initial pitch correction at normal cruise is one bar  cruise is one bar width.  width or less .  

# Altimeter  

The altimeter gives an indirect indication of the pitch  attitude of the helicopter in straight-and-level flight. Since  the altitude should remain constant in level flight, deviation  from the desired altitude indicates a need for a change in  pitch attitude and power as necessary. When losing altitude,  raise the pitch attitude and adjust power as necessary. When  gaining altitude, lower the pitch attitude and adjust power  as necessary. Indications for power changes are explained  in the next paragraph.  

The rate at which the altimeter moves helps to determine pitch  attitude. A very slow movement of the altimeter indicates  a small deviation from the desired pitch attitude, while a  fast movement of the altimeter indicates a large deviation  from the desired pitch attitude. Make any corrective action  promptly with small control changes. Also, remember that  movement of the altimeter should always be corrected by  two distinct changes. The first is a change of attitude to stop  the altimeter movement; the second is a change of attitude to  return smoothly to the desired altitude. If altitude and airspeed  are more than 100 feet and 10 knots low, respectively, apply  power in addition to an increase of pitch attitude. If the  altitude and airspeed are high by more than 100 feet and 10  knots, reduce power and lower the pitch attitude.  

There is a small lag in the movement of the altimeter;  however, for all practical purposes, consider that the altimeter  gives an immediate indication of a change or a need for  change in pitch attitude. Since the altimeter provides the  most pertinent information regarding pitch in level flight, it  is considered primary for pitch.  

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

The VSI gives an indirect indication of the pitch attitude of  the helicopter and should be used in conjunction with the  other pitch instruments to attain a high degree of accuracy  and precision. The instrument indicates zero when in level  flight. Any movement of the needle from the zero position  shows a need for an immediate change in pitch attitude to  return it to zero. Always use the VSI in conjunction with  the altimeter in level flight. If a movement of the VSI is  detected, immediately use the proper corrective measures  to return it to zero. If the correction is made promptly, there  is usually little or no change in altitude. If the needle of the  VSI does not indicate zero, the altimeter indicates a gain or  loss of altitude.  

The initial movement of the vertical speed needle is  instantaneous and indicates the trend of the vertical movement  of the helicopter. A period of time is necessary for the VSI to  reach its maximum point of deflection after a correction has  been made. This time element is commonly referred to as  instrument lag. The lag is directly proportional to the speed  and magnitude of the pitch change. When employing smooth  control techniques and small adjustments in pitch attitude are  made, lag is minimized, and the VSI is easy to interpret.  

Overcontrolling can be minimized by first neutralizing the  controls and allowing the pitch attitude to stabilize, then  readjusting the pitch attitude by noting the indications of the  other pitch instruments.  

Occasionally, the VSI may be slightly out of calibration.  This could result in the instrument indicating a slight climb  or descent even when the helicopter is in level flight. If the  instrument cannot be calibrated properly, this error must be  taken into consideration when using the VSI for pitch control.  For example, if a descent of 100 feet per minute (fpm) is the  vertical speed indication when the helicopter is in level flight,  use that indication as level flight. Any deviation from that  reading would indicate a change in attitude.  

# Airspeed Indicator  

The airspeed indicator gives an indirect indication of  helicopter pitch attitude. With a given power setting and  pitch attitude, the airspeed remains constant. If the airspeed  increases, the nose is too low and should be raised. If  the airspeed decreases, the nose is too high and should  be lowered. A rapid change in airspeed indicates a large  change in pitch attitude, and a slow change in airspeed  indicates a small change in pitch attitude. There is very little  lag in the indications of the airspeed indicator. If, while  making attitude changes, there is some lag between control  application and change of airspeed, it is most likely due to  cyclic control lag. Generally, a departure from the desired  airspeed, due to an inadvertent pitch attitude change, also  results in a change in altitude. For example, an increase in  airspeed due to a low pitch attitude results in a decrease  in altitude. A correction in the pitch attitude regains both  airspeed and altitude.  

# Bank Control  

The bank attitude of a helicopter is the angular relation of  its lateral axis to the natural horizon. To maintain a straight  course in visual flight, keep the lateral axis of the helicopter  level with the natural horizon. Assuming the helicopter is in  coordinated flight, any deviation from a laterally level attitude  produces a turn.  [Figure 8-4]  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator gives a direct indication of the bank  attitude of the helicopter. For instrument flight, the miniature  aircraft and the horizon bar of the attitude indicator are  substituted for the actual helicopter and the natural horizon.  Any change in bank attitude of the helicopter is indicated  instantly by the miniature aircraft. For proper interpretation  of this instrument, imagine being in the miniature aircraft. If  the helicopter is properly trimmed and the rotor tilts, a turn  begins. The turn can be stopped by leveling the miniature  aircraft with the horizon bar. The ball in the turn-and-slip  indicator should always be kept centered through proper  pedal trim.  

The angle of bank is indicated by the pointer on the banking  scale at the top of the instrument. Small bank angles, which  may not be seen by observing the miniature aircraft, can  easily be determined by referring to the banking scale pointer.  

![](images/73cbe02e0b78eda09198b5476a9dc67c0d693141b91a5b143eac746780bf2c3f.jpg)  
Figure 8-4.  The flight instruments used for bank control are the attitude, heading, and turn indicators.  

Pitch-and-bank attitudes can be determined simultaneously  on the attitude indicator. Even though the miniature aircraft  is not level with the horizon bar, pitch attitude can be  established by observing the relative position of the miniature  aircraft and the horizon bar.  [Figure 8-5]  

The attitude indicator may show small misrepresentations  of bank attitude during maneuvers that involve turns. This  precession error can be detected immediately by closely  cross-checking the other bank instruments during these  maneuvers. Precession is normally noticed when rolling  out of a turn. If, upon completion of a turn, the miniature  aircraft is level and the helicopter is still turning, make a  small change of bank attitude to center the turn needle and  stop the movement of the heading indicator.  

# Heading Indicator  

In coordinated flight, the heading indicator gives an indirect  indication of a helicopter’s bank attitude. When a helicopter is  banked, it turns. When the lateral axis of a helicopter is level,  it flies straight. Therefore, in coordinated flight when the  heading indicator shows a constant heading, the helicopter is  level laterally. A deviation from the desired heading indicates  a bank in the direction the helicopter is turning. A small angle  of bank is indicated by a slow change of heading; a large angle  of bank is indicated by a rapid change of heading. If a turn  is noticed, apply opposite cyclic until the heading indicator

Figure 8-5.  The banking scale at the top of the attitude indicator indicates varying degrees of bank. In this example, the helicopter is  banked approximately  $I5^{\circ}$   to the right.  

indicates the desired heading, simultaneously ensuring the  ball is centered. When making the correction to the desired  heading, do not use a bank angle greater than that required  to achieve a standard rate turn. In addition, if the number  of degrees of change is small, limit the bank angle to the  number of degrees to be turned. Bank angles greater than  these require more skill and precision in attaining the desired  results. During straight-and-level flight, the heading indicator  is the primary reference for bank control.  

# Turn Indicator  

During coordinated flight, the needle of the turn-and-slip  indicator gives an indirect indication of the bank attitude  of the helicopter. When the needle is displaced from the  vertical position, the helicopter is turning in the direction of  the displacement. Thus, if the needle is displaced to the left,  the helicopter is turning left. Bringing the needle back to  the vertical position with the cyclic produces straight flight.  A close observation of the needle is necessary to accurately  interpret small deviations from the desired position.  

Cross-check the ball of the turn-and-slip indicator to  determine if the helicopter is in coordinated flight.  [Figure 8-6]  If the rotor is laterally level and pedal pressure  properly compensates for torque, the ball remains in the  center. To center the ball, level the helicopter laterally by  reference to the other bank instruments, then center the ball  with pedal trim. Torque correction pressures vary as power  changes are made. Always check the ball after such changes.  

# Common Errors During Straight-and-Level Flight  

1.	 Failure to maintain altitude  2.	 Failure to maintain heading  3.	 Overcontrolling pitch and bank during corrections  4.	 Failure to maintain proper pedal trim  5.	 Failure to cross-check all available instruments  

# Power Control During Straight-and-Level Flight  

Establishing specific power settings is accomplished through  collective pitch adjustments and throttle control, where  necessary. For reciprocating-powered helicopters, power  indication is observed on the manifold pressure gauge.  For turbine-powered helicopters, power is observed on the  torque gauge. (Although most instrument flight rules (IFR)- certified helicopters are turbine powered, depictions within  this chapter use a reciprocating-powered helicopter as this  is where training is most likely conducted.)  

At any given airspeed, a specific power setting determines  whether the helicopter is in level flight, in a climb, or in a  descent. For example, cruising airspeed maintained with  cruising power results in level flight. If a pilot increases the  power setting and holds the airspeed constant, the helicopter  climbs. Conversely, if the pilot decreases power and holds  the airspeed constant, the helicopter descends.  

![](images/f75f8561123e0c9ea1b2d697593ed89abb4adb03f934ca51a1b57be09e135d85.jpg)  
Figure 8-6.  Coordinated flight is indicated by centering of the ball.  

If the altitude is held constant, power determines the airspeed.  For example, at a constant altitude, cruising power results  in cruising airspeed. Any deviation from the cruising power  setting results in a change of airspeed. When power is added  to increase airspeed, the nose of the helicopter pitches up and  yaws to the right in a helicopter with a counterclockwise main  rotor blade rotation.  [Figure 8-7]  When power is reduced  to decrease airspeed, the nose pitches down and yaws to the  left.  [Figure 8-8]  The yawing effect is most pronounced  in single-rotor helicopters and is absent in helicopters with  counter-rotating rotors. To counteract the yawing tendency  of the helicopter, apply pedal trim during power changes.  

To maintain a constant altitude and airspeed in level flight,  coordinate pitch attitude and power control. The relationship  between altitude and airspeed determines the need for a  change in power and/or pitch attitude. If the altitude is  constant and the airspeed is high or low, change the power to  obtain the desired airspeed. During the change in power, make  an accurate interpretation of the altimeter, then counteract  any deviation from the desired altitude by an appropriate  change of pitch attitude. If the altitude is low and the airspeed  is high, or vice versa, a change in pitch attitude alone may  return the helicopter to the proper altitude and airspeed. If  both airspeed and altitude are low, or if both are high, changes  in both power and pitch attitude are necessary.  

various airspeeds at which the helicopter is flown. When the  airspeed is to be changed by any appreciable amount, adjust  the power so that it is over or under that setting necessary  to maintain the new airspeed. As the power approaches the  desired setting, include the manifold pressure in the cross- check to determine when the proper adjustment has been  accomplished. As the airspeed is changing, adjust the pitch  attitude to maintain a constant altitude. A constant heading  should be maintained throughout the change. As the desired  airspeed is approached, adjust power to the new cruising  power setting and further adjust pitch attitude to maintain  altitude. The instrument indications for straight-and-level  flight at normal cruise and during the transition from normal  cruise to slow cruise are illustrated in  Figures 8-9  and  8-10 .  After the airspeed stabilizes at slow cruise, the attitude  indicator shows an approximate level pitch attitude.  

The altimeter is the primary pitch instrument during level  flight, whether flying at a constant airspeed or during a  change in airspeed. Altitude should not change during  airspeed transitions, and the heading indicator remains the  primary bank instrument. Whenever the airspeed is changed  by an appreciable amount, the manifold pressure gauge is  momentarily the primary instrument for power control.  When the airspeed approaches the desired reading, the  airspeed indicator again becomes the primary instrument  for power control.

To produce straight-and-level flight, the cross-check of the  pitch-and-bank instruments should be combined with the  power control instruments. With a constant power setting, a  normal cross-check should be satisfactory. When changing  power, the speed of the cross-check must be increased to  cover the pitch and bank instruments adequately. This is  necessary to counteract any deviations immediately.  

# Common Errors During Airspeed Changes  

1.	 Improper use of power  2.	 Overcontrolling pitch attitude  3.	 Failure to maintain heading  4.	 Failure to maintain altitude  5.	 Improper pedal trim  

# Straight Climbs (Constant Airspeed and  Constant Rate)  

For any power setting and load condition, there is only  one airspeed that gives the most efficient rate of climb.  To determine this, consult the climb data for the type of  helicopter being flown. The technique varies according to  the airspeed on entry and whether a constant airspeed or  constant rate climb is made.  

# Entry  

increase power to the climb power setting and adjust pitch  attitude to the approximate climb attitude. A helicopter may  or may not have an exact “climb attitude.” To slow down  to climb (versus cruise) airspeed, the nose must be raised.  Depending on power and horizontal stabilizer configuration  and effectiveness, the nose may be level during an established  climb or slightly nose high. Many helicopters are very capable  of climbing and never raising the nose. A short deceleration  period may be necessary to slow to a more efficient climb  airspeed, but the attitude indicator is often level after  the climb is stabilized. The increase in power causes the  helicopter to start climbing and only very slight back cyclic  pressure is needed to complete the change from level to climb  attitude. The attitude indicator should be used to accomplish  the pitch change. If the transition from level flight to a climb  is smooth, the VSI shows an immediate upward trend and  then stops at a rate appropriate to the stabilized airspeed and  attitude. Primary and supporting instruments for climb entry  are illustrated in  Figure 8-11 .  

When the helicopter stabilizes at a constant airspeed and  attitude, the airspeed indicator becomes primary for pitch.  The manifold pressure continues to be primary for power and  should be monitored closely to determine if the proper climb  power setting is being maintained. Primary and supporting  instruments for a stabilized constant airspeed climb are shown  in  Figure 8-12 .  

To enter a constant airspeed climb from cruise airspeed when  the climb speed is lower than cruise speed, simultaneously  

![](images/b1e689f160c72c485f12ae74f4dab521542caaaf3c1b8173edc83c6107d7bc16.jpg)  
Figure 8-11.  Flight instrument indications during climb entry for a constant-airspeed climb.

Figure 8-12.  Flight instrument indications in a stabilized constant-airspeed climb.  

The technique and procedures for entering a constant rate climb  are very similar to those previously described for a constant  airspeed climb. For training purposes, a constant rate climb is  entered from climb airspeed. Use the rate appropriate for the  particular helicopter being flown. Normally, in helicopters with  low climb rates, 500 fpm is appropriate. In helicopters capable  of high climb rates, use a rate of   $1{,}000\,\mathrm{fpm}$  .  

To enter a constant rate climb, increase power to the  approximate setting for the desired rate. As power is applied,  the airspeed indicator is primary for pitch until the vertical  speed approaches the desired rate. At this time, the VSI  becomes primary for pitch. Change pitch attitude by reference  to the attitude indicator to maintain the desired vertical speed.  When the VSI becomes primary for pitch, the airspeed  indicator becomes primary for power.  [Figure 8-13]  Adjust  power to maintain desired airspeed. Pitch attitude and power  corrections should be closely coordinated. To illustrate this,  if the vertical speed is correct but the airspeed is low, add  power. As power is increased, it may be necessary to lower  the pitch attitude slightly to avoid increasing the vertical rate.  Adjust the pitch attitude smoothly to avoid overcontrolling.  Small power corrections are usually sufficient to bring the  airspeed back to the desired indication.  

# Level Off  

The level off from a constant airspeed climb must be started  before reaching the desired altitude. Although the amount  of lead varies with the type of helicopter being flown and  pilot technique, the most important factor is vertical speed.  As a rule of thumb, use 10 percent of the vertical velocity  as the lead point. For example, if the rate of climb is 500  fpm, initiate the level off approximately 50 feet before the  desired altitude. When the proper lead altitude is reached, the  altimeter becomes primary for pitch. Adjust the pitch attitude  to the level flight attitude for that airspeed. Cross-check the  altimeter and VSI to determine when level flight has been  attained at the desired altitude. If cruise airspeed is higher  than climb airspeed, leave the power at the climb power  setting until the airspeed approaches cruise airspeed, and  then reduce it to the cruise power setting. The level off from  a constant rate climb is accomplished in the same manner as  the level off from a constant airspeed climb.  

# Straight Descents (Constant Airspeed  and Constant Rate)  

A descent may be performed at any normal airspeed the  helicopter can attain, but the airspeed must be determined  prior to entry. The technique is determined by the type of  descent, a constant airspeed, or a constant rate.  

# Entry  

If airspeed is higher than descending airspeed, and a constant  airspeed descent is desired, reduce power to a descent  power setting and maintain a constant altitude using cyclic  pitch control. This slows the helicopter. As the helicopter  

![](images/b60a6abeab8d8dead38ef5ffb8908b5b5be2a31c27adda77b9ef117379723a8d.jpg)  
Figure 8-13.  Flight instrument indications in a stabilized constant-rate climb.  

approaches the descending airspeed, the airspeed indicator  becomes primary for pitch and the manifold pressure is  primary for power. Holding the airspeed constant causes the  helicopter to descend. For a constant rate descent, reduce the  power to the approximate setting for the desired rate. If the  descent is started at the descending airspeed, the airspeed  indicator is primary for pitch until the VSI approaches the  desired rate. At this time, the VSI becomes primary for  pitch, and the airspeed indicator becomes primary for power.  Coordinate power and pitch attitude control as previously  described on page 8-10 for constant rate climbs.  

# Level Off  

The level off from a constant airspeed descent may be  made at descending airspeed or at cruise airspeed, if this is  higher than descending airspeed. As in a climb level off, the  amount of lead depends on the rate of descent and control  technique. For a level off at descending airspeed, the lead  should be approximately 10 percent of the vertical speed. At  the lead altitude, simultaneously increase power to the setting  necessary to maintain descending airspeed in level flight. At  this point, the altimeter becomes primary for pitch, and the  airspeed indicator becomes primary for power.  

To level off at an airspeed higher than descending airspeed,  increase the power approximately 100 to 150 feet prior to  reaching the desired altitude. The power setting should be that  which is necessary to maintain the desired airspeed in level  flight. Hold the vertical speed constant until approximately  50 feet above the desired altitude. At this point, the altimeter  becomes primary for pitch and the airspeed indicator becomes  primary for power. The level off from a constant rate descent  should be accomplished in the same manner as the level off  from a constant airspeed descent.  

# Common Errors During Straight Climbs and  Descents  

1.	 Failure to maintain heading  2.	 Improper use of power  3.	 Poor control of pitch attitude  4.	 Failure to maintain proper pedal trim  5.	 Failure to level off on desired altitude  

# Turns  

Turns made by reference to the flight instruments should  be made at a precise rate. Turns described in this chapter  are those not exceeding a standard rate of   $3^{\circ}$   per second  as indicated on the turn-and-slip indicator. True airspeed  determines the angle of bank necessary to maintain a standard  rate turn. A rule of thumb to determine the approximate angle  of bank required for a standard rate turn is to use 15 percent  of the airspeed. A simple way to determine this amount is  to divide the airspeed by 10 and add one-half the result. For  example, at 60 knots approximately  $9^{\circ}$   of bank is required  (  $60\div10=6\qquad$  ,   $6+3=9$  ); at 80 knots approximately   $12^{\circ}$   of  bank is needed for a standard rate turn.  

To enter a turn, apply lateral cyclic in the direction of the  desired turn. The entry should be accomplished smoothly,  using the attitude indicator to establish the approximate bank  angle. When the turn indicator indicates a standard rate turn,  it becomes primary for bank. The attitude indicator now  becomes a supporting instrument. During level turns, the  altimeter is primary for pitch, and the airspeed indicator is  primary for power. Primary and supporting instruments for a  stabilized standard rate turn are illustrated in  Figure 8-14 . If  an increase in power is required to maintain airspeed, slight  forward cyclic pressure may be required since the helicopter  tends to pitch up as collective pitch is increased. Apply pedal  trim, as required, to keep the ball centered.  

To recover to straight-and-level flight, apply cyclic in the  direction opposite the turn. The rate of roll-out should be the  same as the rate used when rolling into the turn. As the turn  recovery is initiated, the attitude indicator becomes primary  for bank. When the helicopter is approximately level, the  heading indicator becomes primary for bank as in straight- and-level flight. Cross-check the airspeed indicator and ball  closely to maintain the desired airspeed and pedal trim.  

# Turn to a Predetermined Heading  

A helicopter turns as long as its lateral axis is tilted;  therefore, the recovery must start before the desired heading  is reached. The amount of lead varies with the rate of turn  and piloting technique.  

As a guide, when making a  $3^{\circ}$   per second rate of turn, use a  lead of one-half the bank angle. For example, if using a   $12^{\circ}$  bank angle, use half of that, or  $6^{\circ}$  , as the lead point prior to the  desired heading. Use this lead until the exact amount required  by a particular technique can be determined. The bank angle  should never exceed the number of degrees to be turned.  As in any standard rate turn, the rate of recovery should be  the same as the rate of entry. During turns to predetermined  headings, cross-check the primary and supporting pitch, bank,  and power instruments closely.  

# Timed Turns  

A timed turn is a turn in which the clock and turn-and-slip  indicator are used to change heading a definite number of  degrees in a given time. For example, using a standard rate  turn, a helicopter turns  $45^{\circ}$   in 15 seconds. Using a half-standard  rate turn, the helicopter turns  $45^{\circ}$   in 30 seconds. Timed turns  can be used if the heading indicator becomes inoperative.  

![](images/dc86cda93dcd12b345dc709fff667abde88671ee2574f9339cf609c0764e9de2.jpg)  
Figure 8-14.  Flight instrument indications in a standard-rate turn to the left.  

Prior to performing timed turns, the turn coordinator should  be calibrated to determine the accuracy of its indications.  To do this, establish a standard rate turn by referring to the  turn-and-slip indicator. Then, as the sweep second hand of  the clock passes a cardinal point (12, 3, 6, or 9), check the  heading on the heading indicator. While holding the indicated  rate of turn constant, note the heading changes at 10-second  intervals. If the helicopter turns more or less than   $30^{\circ}$   in  that interval, a smaller or larger deflection of the needle is  necessary to produce a standard rate turn. After the turn- and-slip indicator has been calibrated during turns in each  direction, note the corrected deflections, if any, and apply  them during all timed turns.  

Use the same cross-check and control technique in making  timed turns that is used to make turns to a predetermined  heading, but substitute the clock for the heading indicator.  The needle of the turn-and-slip indicator is primary for  bank control, the altimeter is primary for pitch control, and  the airspeed indicator is primary for power control. Begin  the roll-in when the clock’s second hand passes a cardinal  point; hold the turn at the calibrated standard rate indication  or half-standard rate for small changes in heading; then  begin the roll-out when the computed number of seconds  has elapsed. If the roll-in and roll-out rates are the same, the  time taken during entry and recovery need not be considered  in the time computation.  

If practicing timed turns with a full instrument panel,  check the heading indicator for the accuracy of the turns.  If executing turns without the heading indicator, use the  magnetic compass at the completion of the turn to check turn  accuracy, taking compass deviation errors into consideration.  

# Change of Airspeed in Turns  

Changing airspeed in turns is an effective maneuver for  increasing proficiency in all three basic instrument skills.  Since the maneuver involves simultaneous changes in all  components of control, proper execution requires a rapid  cross-check and interpretation, as well as smooth control.  Proficiency in the maneuver also contributes to confidence in  the instruments during attitude and power changes involved  in more complex maneuvers.  

Pitch and power control techniques are the same as those  used during airspeed changes in straight-and-level flight.  As discussed previously, the angle of bank necessary for a  given rate of turn is proportional to the true airspeed. Since  the turns are executed at standard rate, the angle of bank  must be varied in direct proportion to the airspeed change in  order to maintain a constant rate of turn. During a reduction  of airspeed, decrease the angle of bank and increase the pitch  attitude to maintain altitude and a standard rate turn.  

Altimeter and turn indicator readings should remain constant  throughout the turn. The altimeter is primary for pitch control,  and the turn needle is primary for bank control. Manifold  pressure is primary for power control while the airspeed is  changing. As the airspeed approaches the new indication, the  airspeed indicator becomes primary for power control.  

Two methods of changing airspeed in turns may be used.  In the first method, airspeed is changed after the turn is  established. In the second method, the airspeed change  is initiated simultaneously with the turn entry. The first  method is easier, but regardless of the method used, the rate  of cross-check must be increased as power is reduced. As  the helicopter decelerates, check the altimeter and VSI for  needed pitch changes and the bank instruments for needed  bank changes. If the needle of the turn-and-slip indicator  shows a deviation from the desired deflection, change the  bank. Adjust pitch attitude to maintain altitude. When the  airspeed approaches that desired, the airspeed indicator  becomes primary for power control. Adjust the power to  maintain the desired airspeed. Use pedal trim to ensure the  maneuver is coordinated.  

Until control technique is very smooth, frequently cross- check the attitude indicator to keep from overcontrolling  and to provide approximate bank angles appropriate for the  changing airspeeds.  

# Compass Turns  

The use of gyroscopic heading indicators makes heading  control very easy. However, if the heading indicator fails  or the helicopter is not equipped with one, use the magnetic  compass for heading reference. When making compass-only  turns, a pilot needs to adjust for the lead or lag created by  acceleration and deceleration errors so that the helicopter rolls  out on the desired heading. When turning to a heading of north,  the lead for the roll-out must include the number of degrees  of latitude plus the lead normally used in recovery from turns.  During a turn to a south heading, maintain the turn until the  compass passes south the number of degrees of latitude, minus  the normal roll-out lead. For example, when turning from an  easterly direction to north, where the latitude is   $30^{\circ}$  , start the  roll-out when the compass reads   $37^{\circ}$     $30^{\circ}$   plus one-half the   $15^{\circ}$   angle of bank or whatever amount is appropriate for the  rate of roll-out). When turning from an easterly direction to  south, start the roll-out when the magnetic compass reads   $203^{\circ}$   (  $180^{\circ}$   plus  $30^{\circ}$   minus one-half the angle of bank). When  making similar turns from a westerly direction, the appropriate  points at which to begin the roll-out would be  $323^{\circ}$   for a turn  to north and  $157^{\circ}$   for a turn to south.  

#  $3\pmb{\theta}^{\circ}$   Bank Turn  

A turn using   $30^{\circ}$   of bank is seldom necessary or advisable  in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and is  considered an unusual attitude in a helicopter. However, it  is an excellent maneuver to practice to increase the ability to  react quickly and smoothly to rapid changes of attitude. Even  though the entry and recovery techniques are the same as for  any other turn, it is more difficult to control pitch because  of the decrease in vertical lift as the bank increases. Also,  because of the decrease in vertical lift, there is a tendency  to lose altitude and/or airspeed. Therefore, to maintain a  constant altitude and airspeed, additional power is required.  Do not initiate a correction, however, until the instruments  indicate the need for one. During the maneuver, note the  need for a correction on the altimeter and VSI, check the  attitude indicator, and then make the necessary adjustments.  After making a change, check the altimeter and VSI again  to determine whether or not the correction was adequate.  

# Climbing and Descending Turns  

For climbing and descending turns, the techniques described  previously for straight climbs, descents, and standard rate  turns are combined. For practice, simultaneously turn and  start the climb or descent. The primary and supporting  instruments for a stabilized constant airspeed left climbing  turn are illustrated in  Figure 8-15 . The level off from a  climbing or descending turn is the same as the level off from  a straight climb or descent. To return to straight-and-level  flight, stop the turn and then level off, or level off and then  stop the turn, or simultaneously level off and stop the turn.  During climbing and descending turns, keep the ball of the  turn indicator centered with pedal trim.  

# Common Errors During Turns  

1.	 Failure to maintain desired turn rate  2.	 Failure to maintain altitude in level turns  3.	 Failure to maintain desired airspeed  4.	 Variation in the rate of entry and recovery  5.	 Failure to use proper lead in turns to a heading  6.	 Failure to properly compute time during timed turns  7.	 Failure to use proper leads and lags during the  compass turns  8.	 Improper use of power  9.	 Failure to use proper pedal trim

Figure 8-15.  Flight instrument indications for a stabilized left climbing turn at a constant airspeed.  

# Unusual Attitudes  

Any maneuver not required for normal helicopter instrument  flight is an unusual attitude and may be caused by any one  or combination of factors, such as turbulence, disorientation,  instrument failure, confusion, preoccupation with flight deck  duties, carelessness in cross-checking, errors in instrument  interpretation, or lack of proficiency in aircraft control. Due  to the instability characteristics of the helicopter, unusual  attitudes can be extremely critical. As soon as an unusual  attitude is detected, make a recovery to straight-and-level  flight as soon as possible with a minimum loss of altitude.  

To recover from an unusual attitude, a pilot should correct  bank-and-pitch attitude and adjust power as necessary. All  components are changed almost simultaneously, with little  lead of one over the other. A pilot must be able to perform  this task with and without the attitude indicator. If the  helicopter is in a climbing or descending turn, adjust bank,  pitch, and power. The bank attitude should be corrected  by referring to the turn-and-slip indicator and attitude  indicator. Pitch attitude should be corrected by reference to  the altimeter, airspeed indicator, VSI, and attitude indicator.  Adjust power by referring to the airspeed indicator and  manifold pressure.  

Since the displacement of the controls used in recovery from  unusual attitudes may be greater than those used for normal  flight, make careful adjustments as straight-and-level flight  is approached. Cross-check the other instruments closely to  avoid overcontrolling.  

# Common Errors During Unusual Attitude  Recoveries  

1.	 Failure to make proper pitch correction  2.	 Failure to make proper bank correction  3.	 Failure to make proper power correction  4.	 Overcontrolling pitch and/or bank attitude  5.	 Overcontrolling power  6.	 Excessive loss of altitude  

# Emergencies  

Emergencies during instrument flight are handled similarly  to those occurring during VFR flight. A thorough knowledge  of the helicopter and its systems, as well as good aeronautical  knowledge and judgment, is the best preparation for  emergency situations. Safe operations begin with preflight  planning and a thorough preflight inspection. Plan a route  of flight to include adequate landing sites in the event of an  emergency landing. Make sure all resources, such as maps,  publications, flashlights, and fire extinguishers, are readily  available for use in an emergency.  

During any emergency, first fly the aircraft. This means  ensure the helicopter is under control, and determine  emergency landing sites. Then perform the emergency  checklist memory items, followed by items written in the  rotorcraft flight manual (RFM). When all these items are  under control, notify air traffic control (ATC). Declare any  emergency on the last assigned ATC frequency. If one was  not issued, transmit on the emergency frequency 121.5. Set  the transponder to the emergency squawk code 7700. This  code triggers an alarm or special indicator in radar facilities.  

When experiencing most in-flight emergencies, such as low  fuel or complete electrical failure, land as soon as possible.  In the event of an electrical fire, turn off all nonessential  equipment and land immediately. Some essential electrical  instruments, such as the attitude indicator, may be required  for a safe landing. A navigation radio failure may not require  an immediate landing if the flight can continue safely. In  this case, land as soon as practical. ATC may be able to  provide vectors to a safe landing area. For specific details  on what to do during an emergency, refer to the RFM for  the helicopter.  

# Autorotations  

Both straight-ahead and turning autorotations should be  practiced by reference to instruments. This training ensures  prompt corrective action to maintain positive aircraft control  in the event of an engine failure.  

To enter autorotation, reduce collective pitch smoothly to  maintain a safe rotor RPM and apply pedal trim to keep the  ball of the turn-and-slip indicator centered. The pitch attitude  of the helicopter should be approximately level as shown by  the attitude indicator. The airspeed indicator is the primary  pitch instrument and should be adjusted to the recommended  autorotation speed. The heading indicator is primary for bank  in a straight-ahead autorotation. In a turning autorotation, a  standard rate turn should be maintained by reference to the  needle of the turn-and-slip indicator.  

# Common Errors During Autorotations  

1.	 Uncoordinated entry due to improper pedal trim  2.	 Poor airspeed control due to improper pitch attitude  3.	 Poor heading control in straight-ahead autorotations  4.	 Failure to maintain proper rotor RPM  5.	 Failure to maintain a standard rate turn during turning  autorotations  

servo fails. If a cyclic servo fails, a pilot may want to land  immediately because the workload increases tremendously. If  an antitorque or collective servo fails, continuing to the next  suitable landing site might be possible.  

# Instrument Takeoff  

The procedures and techniques described here should be  modified as necessary to conform to those set forth in the  operating instructions for the particular helicopter being  flown. During training, instrument takeoffs should not  be attempted except when receiving instruction from an  appropriately certificated, proficient flight instructor pilot.  

Adjust the miniature aircraft in the attitude indicator, as  appropriate, for the aircraft being flown. After the helicopter  is aligned with the runway or takeoff pad, to prevent forward  movement of a helicopter equipped with a wheel-type landing  gear, set the parking brakes or apply the toe brakes. If the  parking brake is used, it must be unlocked after the takeoff  has been completed. Apply sufficient friction to the collective  pitch control to minimize overcontrolling and to prevent  creeping. Excessive friction should be avoided since it limits  collective pitch movement.  

After checking all instruments for proper indications, start  the takeoff by applying collective pitch and a predetermined  power setting. Add power smoothly and steadily to gain  airspeed and altitude simultaneously and to prevent settling to  the ground. As power is applied and the helicopter becomes  airborne, use the antitorque pedals initially to maintain the  desired heading. At the same time, apply forward cyclic to  begin accelerating to climbing airspeed. During the initial  acceleration, the pitch attitude of the helicopter, as read on the  attitude indicator, should be one- to two-bar widths low. The  primary and supporting instruments after becoming airborne  are illustrated in  Figure 8-16 . As the airspeed increases to the  appropriate climb airspeed, adjust pitch gradually to climb  attitude. As climb airspeed is reached, reduce power to the  climb power setting and transition to a fully coordinated  straight climb.  

During the initial climb out, minor heading corrections  should be made with pedals only until sufficient airspeed is  attained to transition to fully coordinated flight. Throughout  the instrument takeoff, instrument cross-check and  interpretations must be rapid and accurate and aircraft control  positive and smooth.  

# Servo Failure  

Most helicopters certified for single-pilot IFR flight are required  to have autopilots, which greatly reduces pilot workload. If an  autopilot servo fails, however, resume manual control of the  helicopter. The amount of workload increase depends on which

Illustrations of technological advancements in instrumentation  are described as follows. In  Figure 8-17,  a typical PFD  depicts an aircraft flying straight-and-level at 3,000 feet and  100 knots.  Figure 8-18  illustrates a nose-low pitch attitude in  a right turn. MFDs can be configured to provide navigation  information, such as the moving map in  Figure 8-19  or  information pertaining to aircraft systems as in  Figure 8-20 .  

# Changing Technology  

Advances in technology have brought about changes in  the instrumentation found in all types of aircraft, including  helicopters. Electronic displays commonly referred to as  “glass cockpits” are becoming more common. Primary flight  displays (PFDs) and multi-function displays (MFDs) are  changing not only what information is available to a pilot  but also how that information is displayed.

# Chapter 9 Navigation  Systems  

# Introduction  

This chapter provides the basic radio principles applicable to  navigation equipment, as well as an operational knowledge  of how to use these systems in instrument flight. This  information provides the framework for all instrument  procedures, including standard instrument departure  procedures (SIDS), departure procedures (DPs), holding  patterns, and approaches, because each of these maneuvers  consists mainly of accurate attitude instrument flying and  accurate tracking using navigation systems.  

# Basic Radio Principles  

A radio wave is an electromagnetic (EM) wave with  frequency characteristics that make it useful. The wave  travels long distances through space (in or out of the  atmosphere) without losing too much strength. An antenna  is used to convert electric current into a radio wave so it can  travel through space to the receiving antenna, which converts  it back into an electric current for use by a receiver.  

# How Radio Waves Propagate  

All matter has a varying degree of conductivity or resistance  to radio waves. The Earth itself acts as the greatest resistor  to radio waves. Radiated energy that travels near the ground  induces a voltage in the ground that subtracts energy from the  wave, decreasing the strength of the wave as the distance from  the antenna becomes greater. Trees, buildings, and mineral  deposits affect the strength to varying degrees. Radiated  energy in the upper atmosphere is likewise affected as the  energy of radiation is absorbed by molecules of air, water,  and dust. The characteristics of radio wave propagation vary  according to the signal frequency and the design, use, and  limitations of the equipment.  

# Ground Wave  

A ground wave travels across the surface of the Earth. You  can best imagine a ground wave’s path as being in a tunnel  or alley bounded by the surface of the Earth and by the  ionosphere, which keeps the ground wave from going out  into space. Generally, the lower the frequency, the farther  the signal travels.  

Ground waves are usable for navigation purposes because  they travel reliably and predictably along the same route  day after day and are not influenced by too many outside  factors. The ground wave frequency range is generally from  the lowest frequencies in the radio range (perhaps as low as   $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$  ) up to approximately   $1{,}000\,\mathrm{kHz}$   (1 MHz). Although  there is a ground wave component to frequencies above this,  up to  $30\:\mathrm{MHz}$  , the ground wave at these higher frequencies  loses strength over very short distances.  

# Sky Wave  

The sky wave, at frequencies of 1 to   $30\ \mathrm{MHz}$  , is good for  long distances because these frequencies are refracted or  “bent” by the ionosphere, causing the signal to be sent back  to Earth from high in the sky and received great distances  away.  [Figure 9-1]  Used by high frequency (HF) radios in  aircraft, messages can be sent across oceans using only 50  to 100 watts of power. Frequencies that produce a sky wave  are not used for navigation because the pathway of the signal  from transmitter to receiver is highly variable. The wave is  

![](images/745a6cf45276c228c33e2f8315945ee521ed3271002aeacc71a148544b1fb246.jpg)  
Figure 7-1.   Figure 9-1.  Ground, space, and sky wave propogation.  

“bounced” off of the ionosphere, which is always changing  due to the varying amount of the sun’s radiation reaching it  (night/day and seasonal variations, sunspot activity, etc.). The  sky wave is, therefore, unreliable for navigation purposes.  

For aeronautical communication purposes, the sky wave  (HF) is about 80 to 90 percent reliable. HF is being gradually  replaced by more reliable satellite communication.  

# Space Wave  

When able to pass through the ionosphere, radio waves  of   $15~\mathrm{MHz}$   and above (all the way up to many GHz), are  considered space waves. Most navigation systems operate  with signals propagating as space waves. Frequencies above   $100\,\mathrm{MHz}$   have nearly no ground or sky wave components.  They are space waves, but (except for global positioning  system (GPS)) the navigation signal is used before it reaches  the ionosphere so the effect of the ionosphere, which can  cause some propagation errors, is minimal. GPS errors  caused by passage through the ionosphere are significant  and are corrected for by the GPS receiver system.  

Space waves have another characteristic of concern to users.  Space waves reflect off hard objects and may be blocked if  the object is between the transmitter and the receiver. Site  and terrain error, as well as propeller/rotor modulation error  in very high omnidirectional range (VOR) systems, is caused  by this bounce. Instrument landing system (ILS) course  distortion is also the result of this phenomenon, which led  to the need for establishment of ILS critical areas.  

Generally, space waves are “line of sight” receivable, but  those of lower frequencies “bend” somewhat over the  horizon. The VOR signal at 108 to   $118\ \mathrm{MHz}$   is a lower  frequency than distance measuring equipment (DME) at 962  to  $1213\,\mathrm{MHz}$  . Therefore, when an aircraft is flown “over the  horizon” from a VOR/DME station, the DME is normally  the first to stop functioning.  

# Disturbances to Radio Wave Reception  

Static distorts the radio wave and interferes with normal  reception of communications and navigation signals. Low- frequency airborne equipment, such as automatic direction  finder (ADF) and LORAN (LOng RAnge Navigation)  ,are particularly subject to static disturbance. Using very  high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF)  frequencies avoids many of the discharge noise effects.  Static noise heard on navigation or communication radio  frequencies may be a warning of interference with navigation  instrument displays. Some of the problems caused by  precipitation static (P-static) are:  

• 	 Complete loss of VHF communications. • 	 Erroneous magnetic compass readings. • 	 Aircraft flying with one wing low while using  the autopilot. • 	 High-pitched squeal on audio. • 	 Motorboat sound on audio. • 	 Loss of all avionics. •	 Inoperative very-low frequency (VLF) navigation  system. • 	 Erratic instrument readouts. • 	 Weak transmissions and poor radio reception. • 	 St. Elmo’s Fire.  

# Traditional Navigation Systems  

# Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB)  

The nondirectional radio beacon (NDB) is a ground-based  radio transmitter that transmits radio energy in all directions.  The ADF, when used with an NDB, determines the bearing  from the aircraft to the transmitting station. The indicator  may be mounted in a separate instrument in the aircraft  panel.  [Figure 9-2]  The ADF needle points to the NDB  ground station to determine the relative bearing (RB) to the  transmitting station. It is the number of degrees measured  clockwise between the aircraft’s heading and the direction  from which the bearing is taken. The aircraft’s magnetic  heading (MH) is the direction the aircraft is pointed with  respect to magnetic north. The magnetic bearing (MB) is the  direction to or from a radio transmitting station measured  relative to magnetic north.

Figure 9-2.  ADF indicator instrument and receiver.  

# NDB Components  

The ground equipment, the NDB, transmits in the frequency  range of 190 to   $535~\mathrm{kHz}$  . Most ADFs also tune the AM  broadcast band frequencies above the NDB band (550 to   $1650~\mathrm{kHz}$  ). However, these frequencies are not approved  for navigation because stations do not continuously identify  themselves, and they are much more susceptible to sky wave  propagation especially from dusk to dawn. NDB stations  are capable of voice transmission and are often used for  transmitting the Automated Weather Observing System  (AWOS). The aircraft must be in operational range of the  NDB. Coverage depends on the strength of the transmitting  station. Before relying on ADF indications, identify the  station by listening to the Morse code identifier. NDB stations  are usually two letters or an alpha-numeric combination.  

# ADF Components  

The airborne equipment includes two antennas: a receiver  and the indicator instrument. The “sense” antenna (non- directional) receives signals with nearly equal efficiency  from all directions. The “loop” antenna receives signals  better from two directions (bidirectional). When the loop  and sense antenna inputs are processed together in the ADF  radio, the result is the ability to receive a radio signal well in  all directions but one, thus resolving all directional ambiguity. The indicator instrument can be one of four kinds: fixed- card ADF, rotatable compass-card ADF, or radio magnetic  indicator (RMI) with either one needle or dual needle. Fixed- card ADF (also known as the relative bearing indicator (RBI))  always indicates zero at the top of the instrument, with the  needle indicating the RB to the station.  Figure 9-3  indicates  an RB of   $135^{\circ}$  ; if the MH is  $045^{\circ}$  , the MB to the station is   $180^{\circ}$  .   $(\mathrm{MHz}+\mathrm{RB}=\mathrm{MB}$   to the station.)  

![](images/707ec122947eaa1fd2e390190c6d461cc418f21450671819253b633395fb10f7.jpg)  
Figure 7-3.   Relative bearing (RB) on a fixed-card indicator. Note  that the card always indicates   $360^{\circ}$   or north. In this case, the RB  to the station is   $I35^{\circ}$   to the right. If the aircraft were on a magnetic  heading of  $\cdot360^{\circ}$  , then the magnetic bearing (MB) would also be  $I35^{\circ}$  .  

The movable-card ADF allows the pilot to rotate the aircraft’s  present heading to the top of the instrument so that the head  of the needle indicates MB to the station and the tail indicates  MB from the station.  Figure 9-4  indicates a heading of  $045^{\circ}$  ,  MB to the station of   $180^{\circ}$  , and MB from the station of  $360^{\circ}$  .  

The RMI differs from the movable-card ADF in that it  automatically rotates the azimuth card (remotely controlled  by a gyrocompass) to represent aircraft heading. The RMI  has two needles, which can be used to indicate navigation  information from either the ADF or the VOR receiver. When  a needle is being driven by the ADF, the head of the needle  indicates the MB TO the station tuned on the ADF receiver.  The tail of the needle is the bearing FROM the station. When  a needle of the RMI is driven by a VOR receiver, the needle  indicates where the aircraft is radially with respect to the  VOR station. The needle points the bearing TO the station  as read on the azimuth card. The tail of the needle points to  the radial of the VOR the aircraft is currently on or crossing.  Figure 9-5  indicates a heading of  $360^{\circ}$  , the MB to the station  is   $005^{\circ}$  , and the MB from the station is   $185^{\circ}$  .

Figure 7-4.   Relative bearing (RB) on a movable-card indicator. By  placing the aircraft’s magnetic heading (MH) of   $045^{\circ}$   under the  top index, the RB of  $I35^{\circ}$   to the right is also the magnetic bearing  (no wind conditions), which takes you to the transmitting station.

Figure 7-5.   Radio magnetic indicator (RMI).  Figure 9-5. Radio magnetic indicator (RMI). Because the aircraft’s  magnetic heading (MH) is automatically changed, the relative  bearing (RB), in this case   $O95^{\circ}$  , indicates the magnetic bearing   $(O95^{\circ})$   to the station (no wind conditions) and the MH that takes  you there.  

# Function of ADF  

The ADF can be used to plot your position, track inbound  and outbound, and intercept a bearing. These procedures  are used to execute holding patterns and nonprecision  instrument approaches.  

# Orientation  

The ADF needle points TO the station, regardless of aircraft  heading or position. The RB indicated is thus the angular  relationship between the aircraft heading and the station,  measured clockwise from the nose of the aircraft. Think of  the nose/tail and left/right needle indications, visualizing the  ADF dial in terms of the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.  When the needle points to  $0^{\circ}$  , the nose of the aircraft points  directly to the station; with the pointer on  $210^{\circ}$  , the station  is   $30^{\circ}$   to the left of the tail; with the pointer on   $090^{\circ}$  , the  station is off the right wingtip. The RB alone does not indicate  aircraft position. The RB must be related to aircraft heading  in order to determine direction to or from the station.  

# Station Passage  

When you are near the station, slight deviations from  the desired track result in large deflections of the needle.  Therefore, it is important to establish the correct drift  correction angle as soon as possible. Make small heading  corrections (not over   $5^{\circ}$  ) as soon as the needle shows a  deviation from course, until it begins to rotate steadily toward  a wingtip position or shows erratic left/right oscillations. You  are abeam a station when the needle points  $90^{\circ}$   off your track.  Hold your last corrected heading constant and time station  passage when the needle shows either wingtip position or  settles at or near the   $180^{\circ}$   position. The time interval from  the first indications of station proximity to positive station  passage varies with altitude—a few seconds at low levels to  3 minutes at high altitude.  

# Homing  

The ADF may be used to “home” in on a station. Homing  is flying the aircraft on any heading required to keep the  needle pointing directly to the   $0^{\circ}\,\mathrm{RB}$   position. To home in  on a station, tune the station, identify the Morse code signal,  and then turn the aircraft to bring the ADF azimuth needle to  the  $0^{\circ}\,\mathrm{RB}$   position. Turns should be made using the heading  indicator. When the turn is complete, check the ADF needle  and make small corrections as necessary.  

Figure 9-6  illustrates homing starting from an initial MH of   $050^{\circ}$   and an RB of  $310^{\circ}$  , indicating a  $50^{\circ}$   left turn is needed  to produce an RB of zero. Turn left, rolling out at  $50^{\circ}$   minus   $50^{\circ}$   equals   $360^{\circ}$  . Small heading corrections are then made  to zero the ADF needle.  

If there is no wind, the aircraft homes to the station on a direct  track over the ground. With a crosswind, the aircraft follows  a circuitous path to the station on the downwind side of the  direct track to the station.  

Tracking  

Tracking uses a heading that maintains the desired track  to or from the station regardless of crosswind conditions.  Interpretation of the heading indicator and needle is done to  maintain a constant MB to or from the station.  

To track inbound, turn to the heading that produces a zero  RB. Maintain this heading until off-course drift is indicated  by displacement of the needle, which occurs if there is a  crosswind (needle moving left  $=$   wind from the left; needle  moving right  $=$   wind from the right). A rapid rate of bearing  change with a constant heading indicates either a strong  crosswind or close proximity to the station or both. When  there is a definite   $2^{\circ}$   to  $5^{\circ}$  ) change in needle reading, turn in  the direction of needle deflection to intercept the initial MB.  The angle of interception must be greater than the number  of degrees of drift, otherwise the aircraft slowly drifts due to  the wind pushing the aircraft. If repeated often enough, the  track to the station appears circular and the distance greatly  increased as compared to a straight track. The intercept angle  depends on the rate of drift, the aircraft speed, and station  proximity. Initially, it is standard to double the RB when  turning toward your course.  

For example, if your heading equals your course and the  needle points   $10^{\circ}$   left, turn   $20^{\circ}$   left, twice the initial RB.  [Figure 9-7]  This is your intercept angle to capture the  RB. Hold this heading until the needle is deflected   $20^{\circ}$   in  the opposite direction. That is, the deflection of the needle  equals the interception angle (in this case  $20^{\circ}$  ). The track has  been intercepted, and the aircraft remains on track as long  as the RB remains the same number of degrees as the wind  correction angle (WCA), the angle between the desired track  and the heading of the aircraft necessary to keep the aircraft  tracking over the desired track. Lead the interception to avoid  overshooting the track. Turn  $10^{\circ}$   toward the inbound course.  You are now inbound with a   $10^{\circ}$   left correction angle.  

NOTE: In  Figure 9-7 , for the aircraft closest to the station,  the WCA is   $10^{\circ}$   left and the RB is  $10^{\circ}$   right. If those values  do not change, the aircraft tracks directly to the station. If you  observe off-course deflection in the original direction, turn  again to the original interception heading. When the desired  course has been re-intercepted, turn  $5^{\circ}$   toward the inbound  course, proceeding inbound with a  $15^{\circ}$   drift correction. If the  initial   $10^{\circ}$   drift correction is excessive, as shown by needle  deflection away from the wind, turn to parallel the desired  course and let the wind drift you back on course. When the  needle is again zeroed, turn into the wind with a reduced  drift correction angle.

Figure 9-7.   ADF tracking inbound.  

To track outbound, the same principles apply: needle moving  left  $=$   wind from the left, needle moving right  $=$   wind from the  right. Wind correction is made toward the needle deflection.  The only exception is while the turn to establish the WCA is  being made, the direction of the azimuth needle deflections is  reversed. When tracking inbound, needle deflection decreases  while turning to establish the WCA, and needle deflection  increases when tracking outbound. Note the example of  course interception and outbound tracking in  Figure 9-8.  

# Intercepting Bearings  

ADF orientation and tracking procedures may be applied to  intercept a specified inbound or outbound MB. To intercept  an inbound bearing of  $355^{\circ}$  , the following steps may be used.  [Figure 9-9]  

1.	 Determine your position in relation to the station by  paralleling the desired inbound bearing. In this case,  turn to a heading of   $355^{\circ}$  . Note that the station is to  the right front of the aircraft. 2.	 Determine the number of degrees of needle deflection  from the nose of the aircraft. In this case, the needle’s  RB from the aircraft’s nose is  $40^{\circ}$   to the right. A rule  of thumb for interception is to double this RB amount  as an interception angle   $(80^{\circ})$  .  3.	 Turn the aircraft toward the desired MB the number of  degrees determined for the interception angle, which  as indicated (in two above) is twice the initial RB   $(40^{\circ})$    or, in this case,   $80^{\circ}$  . Therefore, the right turn is   $80^{\circ}$    from the initial MB of  $355^{\circ}$   or a turn to  $075^{\circ}$   magnetic   $(355^{\circ}+80^{\circ}+075^{\circ})$  ). 4.	 Maintain this interception heading of   $075^{\circ}$   until the  needle is deflected the same number of degrees “left”  from the zero position as the angle of interception  $080^{\circ}$    (minus any lead appropriate for the rate at which the  bearing is changing). 5.	 Turn left  $80^{\circ}$   and the RB (in a no wind condition and  with proper compensation for the rate of the ADF  needle movement) should be   $0^{\circ}$   or directly off the  nose. Additionally, the MB should be  $355^{\circ}$   indicating  proper interception of the desired course.  

NOTE: The rate of an ADF needle movement, or any bearing  pointer for that matter, is faster as aircraft position becomes  closer to the station or waypoint (WP).  

Interception of an outbound MB can be accomplished by the  same procedures as for the inbound intercept, except that  it is necessary to substitute the   $180^{\circ}$   position for the zero  position on the needle.  

# Operational Errors of ADF  

Some of the common pilot-induced errors associated with  ADF navigation are listed below to help you avoid making  the same mistakes. The errors are:  

1.	 Failure to keep the heading indicator set so that it  agrees with the corrected magnetic compass reading.  Initiating an ADF approach without verifying that the  heading indicator agrees with the corrected compass  indicator reading may cause the pilot to believe that  he is on course but still impact the terrain (CFIT). 2.	 Improper tuning and station identification. Many pilots  have made the mistake of homing or tracking to the  wrong station. 3.	 Positively identifying any malfunctions of the RMI  slaving system or ignoring the warning flag. 4.	 Dependence on homing rather than proper tracking.  This commonly results from sole reliance on the  ADF indications rather than correlating them with  heading indications. 5.	 Poor orientation due to failure to follow proper steps  in orientation and tracking. 6.	 Careless interception angles, very likely to happen if  you rush the initial orientation procedure. 7.	 Overshooting and undershooting predetermined  MBs, often due to forgetting the course interception  angles used. 8.	 Failure to maintain selected headings. Any heading  change is accompanied by an ADF needle change.  The instruments must be read in combination before  any interpretation is made. 9.	 Failure to understand the limitations of the ADF and  the factors that affect its use. 10.	 Overcontrolling track corrections close to the station  (chasing the ADF needle) due to failure to understand  or recognize station approach.  

# Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range  (VOR)  

VOR is the primary navigational aid (NAVAID) used by civil  aviation in the National Airspace System (NAS). The VOR  ground station is oriented to magnetic north and transmits  azimuth information to the aircraft, providing 360 courses  TO or FROM the VOR station. When DME is installed with  the VOR, it is referred to as a VOR/DME and provides both  azimuth and distance information. When military tactical air  navigation (TACAN) equipment is installed with the VOR,  it is known as a VORTAC and provides both azimuth and  distance information.

Figure 9-9.   Interception of bearing.  

The courses oriented FROM the station are called radials. The  VOR information received by an aircraft is not influenced  by aircraft attitude or heading.  [Figure 9-10]  Radials can  be envisioned to be like the spokes of a wheel on which the  aircraft is on one specific radial at any time. For example,  aircraft A (heading  $180^{\circ}.$  ) is inbound on the  $360^{\circ}$   radial; after  crossing the station, the aircraft is outbound on the   $180^{\circ}$  radial at A1. Aircraft B is shown crossing the   $225^{\circ}$   radial.  Similarly, at any point around the station, an aircraft can be  located somewhere on a specific VOR radial. Additionally,  a VOR needle on an RMI always points to the course that  takes you to the VOR station where conversely the ADF  needle points to the station as a RB from the aircraft. In  the example above, the ADF needle at position A would be  pointed straight ahead, at A1 to the aircraft’s   $180^{\circ}$   position  (tail) and at B to the aircraft’s right.  

The VOR receiver measures and presents information to  indicate bearing TO or FROM the station. In addition to the  navigation signals transmitted by the VOR, a Morse code  signal is transmitted concurrently to identify the facility, as

well as voice transmissions for communication and relay of  weather and other information.  

VORs are classified according to their operational uses. The  standard VOR facility has a power output of approximately  200 watts, with a maximum usable range depending upon  the aircraft altitude, class of facility, location of the facility,  terrain conditions within the usable area of the facility, and  other factors. Above and beyond certain altitude and distance  limits, signal interference from other VOR facilities and a  weak signal make it unreliable. Coverage is typically at least  40 miles at normal minimum instrument flight rules (IFR)  altitudes. VORs with accuracy problems in parts of their  service volume are listed in Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)  and in the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) under the name  of the NAVAID.  

# VOR Components  

The ground equipment consists of a VOR ground station,  which is a small, low building topped with a flat white disc,  upon which are located the VOR antennas and a fiberglass  cone-shaped tower.  [Figure 9-11]  The station includes an  automatic monitoring system. The monitor automatically  turns off defective equipment and turns on the standby  transmitter. Generally, the accuracy of the signal from the  ground station is within   $1^{\circ}$  .  

![](images/f52a7f05c54407b2f607d413f0024c3e79a0cf5c9f1996c55bd029b975ec6b17.jpg)  
Figure 9-11.   VOR transmitter (ground station).  

VOR facilities are aurally identified by Morse code, or  voice, or both. The VOR can be used for ground-to-air  communication without interference with the navigation  signal. VOR facilities operate within the 108.0 to  $117.95\,\mathrm{MHz}$  frequency band and assignment between 108.0 and 112.0  MHz is in even-tenth increments to preclude any conflict  with ILS localizer frequency assignment, which uses the  odd tenths in this range.  

The airborne equipment includes an antenna, a receiver, and  the indicator instrument. The receiver has a frequency knob to  select any of the frequencies between 108.0 to  $117.95\,\mathrm{MHz}$  .  The ON/OFF/volume control turns on the navigation receiver  and controls the audio volume. The volume has no effect on  the operation of the receiver. You should listen to the station  identifier before relying on the instrument for navigation.  

VOR indicator instruments have at least the essential  components shown in the instrument illustrated in  Figure 9-12.  

![](images/efc4218d77bd26e7f3ab5a0f03371f8e62082d05dac27a0567cfce14653b8eff.jpg)  
Figure 9-12.   The VOR indicator instrument.  

# Omnibearing Selector (OBS)  

The desired course is selected by turning the omnibearing  selector (OBS) knob until the course is aligned with the  course index mark or displayed in the course window.  

# Course Deviation Indicator   $(C D I)$  

The course deviation indicator (CDI) is composed of an  instrument face and a needle hinged to move laterally across  the instrument face. The needle centers when the aircraft is  on the selected radial or its reciprocal. Full needle deflection  from the center position to either side of the dial indicates the  aircraft is   $12^{\circ}$   or more off course, assuming normal needle  sensitivity. The outer edge of the center circle is  $2^{\circ}$   off course;  with each dot representing an additional  $2^{\circ}$  .  

# TO/FROM Indicator  

The TO/FROM indicator shows whether the selected course,  if intercepted and flown, takes the aircraft TO or FROM the  station. It does not indicate whether the aircraft is heading  to or from the station.  

# Flags or Other Signal Strength Indicators  

The device that indicates a usable or an unreliable signal may  be an “OFF” flag. It retracts from view when signal strength  is sufficient for reliable instrument indications. Alternately,  insufficient signal strength may be indicated by a blank or  OFF in the TO/FROM window.  

The indicator instrument may also be a horizontal situation  indicator (HSI), which combines the heading indicator  and CDI.  [Figure 9-13]  The combination of navigation  information from VOR/Localizer (LOC) with aircraft heading  information provides a visual picture of the aircraft’s location  and direction. This decreases pilot workload especially  with tasks such as course intercepts, flying a back-course  approach, or holding pattern entry. (See Chapter 5, Flight  Instruments, for operational characteristics.)  [Figure 9-14]  

# Function of VOR  

Orientation  

The VOR does not account for the aircraft heading. It only  relays the aircraft direction from the station and has the same  indications regardless of which way the nose is pointing. Tune  the VOR receiver to the appropriate frequency of the selected  VOR ground station, turn up the audio volume, and identify  the station’s signal audibly. Then, rotate the OBS to center  the CDI needle and read the course under or over the index.  

In  Figure 9-12 ,   $360^{\circ}$   TO is the course indicated, while in  Figure 9-15 ,  $180^{\circ}$   TO is the course. The latter indicates that  the aircraft (which may be heading in any direction) is, at  this moment, located at any point on the   $360^{\circ}$   radial (line  from the station) except directly over the station or very

Figure 9-15.   CDI interpretation. The CDI as typically found on analog systems (right) and as found on electronic flight instruments (left).  

close to it, as in  Figure 9-15 . The CDI deviates from side  to side as the aircraft passes over or nearly over the station  because of the volume of space above the station where the  zone of confusion exists. This zone of confusion is caused  by lack of adequate signal directly above the station due to  the radiation pattern of the station’s antenna, and because  the resultant of the opposing reference and variable signals  is small and constantly changing.  

The CDI in  Figure 9-15  indicates   $180^{\circ}$  , meaning that the  aircraft is on the  $180^{\circ}$   or the  $360^{\circ}$   radial of the station. The TO/ FROM indicator resolves the ambiguity. If the TO indicator is  showing, then it is  $180^{\circ}$   TO the station. The FROM indication  indicates the radial of the station the aircraft is presently on.  Movement of the CDI from center, if it occurs at a relatively  constant rate, indicates the aircraft is moving or drifting off  the   $180^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$   line. If the movement is rapid or fluctuating,  this is an indication of impending station passage (the aircraft  is near the station). To determine the aircraft’s position  relative to the station, rotate the OBS until FROM appears  in the window, and then center the CDI needle. The index  indicates the VOR radial where the aircraft is located. The  inbound (to the station) course is the reciprocal of the radial.  

If the VOR is set to the reciprocal of the intended course, the  CDI reflects reverse sensing. To correct for needle deflection,  turn away from the needle. To avoid this reverse sensing  situation, set the VOR to agree with the intended course.  

A single NAVAID allows a pilot to determine the aircraft’s  position relative to a radial. Indications from a second  NAVAID are needed in order to narrow the aircraft’s position  down to an exact location on this radial.  

# Tracking TO and FROM the Station  

To track to the station, rotate the OBS until TO appears,  then center the CDI. Fly the course indicated by the index.  If the CDI moves off center to the left, follow the needle by  correcting course to the left, beginning with a  $20^{\circ}$   correction.  

When flying the course indicated on the index, a left deflection  of the needle indicates a crosswind component from the left.  If the amount of correction brings the needle back to center,  decrease the left course correction by half. If the CDI moves  left or right now, it should do so much more slowly, and smaller  heading corrections can be made for the next iteration.  

Keeping the CDI centered takes the aircraft to the station.  To track to the station, the OBS value at the index is not  changed. To home to the station, the CDI needle is periodically  centered, and the new course under the index is used for the  aircraft heading. Homing follows a circuitous route to the  station, just as with ADF homing.  

To track FROM the station on a VOR radial, you should  first orient the aircraft’s location with respect to the station  and the desired outbound track by centering the CDI needle  with a FROM indication. The track is intercepted by either  flying over the station or establishing an intercept heading.  The magnetic course of the desired radial is entered under the  index using the OBS and the intercept heading held until the  CDI centers. Then the procedure for tracking to the station  is used to fly outbound on the specified radial.  

# Course Interception  

If the desired course is not the one being flown, first orient  the aircraft’s position with respect to the VOR station and the  course to be flown, and then establish an intercept heading.  The following steps may be used to intercept a predetermined  course, either inbound or outbound. Steps 1–3 may be omitted  when turning directly to intercept the course without initially  turning to parallel the desired course.  

1.	 Determine the difference between the radial to be  intercepted and the radial on which the aircraft is  located   $(205^{\circ}-160^{\circ}=045^{\circ})$  ). 2.	 Double the difference to determine the interception  angle, which will not be less than   $20^{\circ}$   nor greater  than   $90^{\circ}$     $(45^{\circ}\times2=090^{\circ})$  ).   $205^{\circ}+090^{\circ}=295^{\circ}$   for  the intercept).    3.	 Rotate the OBS to the desired radial or inbound course. 4.	 Turn to the interception heading. 5.	 Hold this heading constant until the CDI center, which  indicates the aircraft is on course. (With practice in  judging the varying rates of closure with the course  centerline, pilots learn to lead the turn to prevent  overshooting the course.) 6.	 Turn to the MH corresponding to the selected course,  and follow tracking procedures inbound or outbound.  

Course interception is illustrated in  Figure 9-16 .  

# VOR Operational Errors  

Typical pilot-induced errors include:  

1.	 Careless tuning and identification of station. 2.	 Failure to check receiver for accuracy/sensitivity. 3.	 Turning in the wrong direction during an orientation.  This error is common until visualizing position rather  than heading. 4.	 Failure to check the ambiguity (TO/FROM) indicator,  particularly during course reversals, resulting in reverse  sensing and corrections in the wrong direction.  

![](images/c2a7f1a7e8989133afbb7e2a0cd155f173b57be920c5bc1e1cabb9471b3ba89e.jpg)  

5.	 Failure to parallel the desired radial on a track  interception problem. Without this step, orientation  to the desired radial can be confusing. Since pilots  think in terms of left and right of course, aligning the  aircraft position to the radial/course is essential. 6.	 Overshooting and undershooting radials on  interception problems. 7.	 Overcontrolling corrections during tracking, especially  close to the station. 8.	 Misinterpretation of station passage. On VOR  receivers not equipped with an ON/OFF flag, a  voice transmission on the combined communication  and navigation radio (NAV/COM) in use for VOR  may cause the same TO/FROM fluctuations on the  ambiguity meter as shown during station passage.  Read the whole receiver—TO/FROM, CDI, and  OBS—before you make a decision. Do not utilize a  VOR reading observed while transmitting. 9.	 Chasing the CDI, resulting in homing instead of  tracking. Careless heading control and failure to  bracket wind corrections make this error common.  

# VOR Accuracy  

The effectiveness of the VOR depends upon proper use and  adjustment of both ground and airborne equipment.  

The accuracy of course alignment of the VOR is generally  plus or minus  $1^{\circ}$  . On some VORs, minor course roughness  may be observed, evidenced by course needle or brief flag  alarm. At a few stations, usually in mountainous terrain,  the pilot may occasionally observe a brief course needle  oscillation similar to the indication of “approaching station.”  Pilots flying over unfamiliar routes are cautioned to be on  the alert for these vagaries, and in particular, to use the TO/ FROM indicator to determine positive station passage.  

Certain propeller revolutions per minute (rpm) settings or  helicopter rotor speeds can cause the VOR CDI to fluctuate  as much as plus or minus   $6^{\circ}$  . Slight changes to the RPM  setting normally smooths out this roughness. Pilots are urged  to check for this modulation phenomenon prior to reporting  a VOR station or aircraft equipment for unsatisfactory  operation.  

# VOR Receiver Accuracy Check  

VOR system course sensitivity may be checked by noting  the number of degrees of change as the OBS is rotated to  move the CDI from center to the last dot on either side. The  course selected should not exceed   $10^{\circ}$   or  $12^{\circ}$   either side. In  addition, Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) part 91 provides for certain VOR equipment accuracy  checks, and an appropriate endorsement, within 30 days prior  to flight under IFR. To comply with this requirement and to  ensure satisfactory operation of the airborne system, use the  following means for checking VOR receiver accuracy:  

1.	 VOR test facility (VOT) or a radiated test signal from  an appropriately rated radio repair station. 2.	 Certified checkpoints on the airport surface. 3.	 Certified airborne checkpoints.  

# VOR Test Facility (VOT)  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) VOT transmits  a test signal that provides users a convenient means to  determine the operational status and accuracy of a VOR  receiver while on the ground where a VOT is located.  Locations of VOTs are published in the A/FD. Two  means of identification are used: one is a series of dots  and the other is a continuous tone. Information concerning  an individual test signal can be obtained from the local  flight service station (FSS.) The airborne use of VOT is  permitted; however, its use is strictly limited to those areas/ altitudes specifically authorized in the A/FD or appropriate  supplement.  

To use the VOT service, tune in the VOT frequency 108.0   $\mathrm{MHz}$   on the VOR receiver. With the CDI centered, the  OBS should read  $0^{\circ}$   with the TO/FROM indication showing  FROM or the OBS should read   $180^{\circ}$   with the TO/FROM  indication showing TO. Should the VOR receiver operate an  RMI, it would indicate   $180^{\circ}$   on any OBS setting.  

A radiated VOT from an appropriately rated radio repair  station serves the same purpose as an FAA VOT signal, and  the check is made in much the same manner as a VOT with  some differences.  

The frequency normally approved by the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) is   $108.0\ \mathrm{MHz}$  ;  however, repair stations are not permitted to radiate the  VOR test signal continuously. The owner or operator of the  aircraft must make arrangements with the repair station to  have the test signal transmitted. A representative of the repair  station must make an entry into the aircraft logbook or other  permanent record certifying to the radial accuracy and the  date of transmission.  

# Certified Checkpoints  

Airborne and ground checkpoints consist of certified radials  that should be received at specific points on the airport surface  or over specific landmarks while airborne in the immediate  vicinity of the airport. Locations of these checkpoints are  published in the A/FD.  

Should an error in excess of  $\pm4^{\circ}$   be indicated through use of  a ground check, or  $\pm6^{\circ}$   using the airborne check, IFR flight  shall not be attempted without first correcting the source of  the error. No correction other than the correction card figures  supplied by the manufacturer should be applied in making  these VOR receiver checks.  

If a dual system VOR (units independent of each other except  for the antenna) is installed in the aircraft, one system may  be checked against the other. Turn both systems to the same  VOR ground facility and note the indicated bearing to that  station. The maximum permissible variation between the two  indicated bearings is  $4^{\circ}$  .  

# Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)  

When used in conjunction with the VOR system, DME makes  it possible for pilots to determine an accurate geographic  position of the aircraft, including the bearing and distance TO  or FROM the station. The aircraft DME transmits interrogating  radio frequency (RF) pulses, which are received by the DME  antenna at the ground facility. The signal triggers ground  receiver equipment to respond to the interrogating aircraft. The  airborne DME equipment measures the elapsed time between  the interrogation signal sent by the aircraft and reception of the  reply pulses from the ground station. This time measurement is  converted into distance in nautical miles (NM) from the station.  

Some DME receivers provide a groundspeed in knots by  monitoring the rate of change of the aircraft’s position relative  to the ground station. Groundspeed values are accurate only  when tracking directly to or from the station.  

# DME Components  

VOR/DME, VORTAC, ILS/DME, and LOC/DME  navigation facilities established by the FAA provide course  and distance information from collocated components under  a frequency pairing plan. DME operates on frequencies  in the UHF spectrum between   $962\ \mathrm{MHz}$   and   $1213\ \mathrm{MHz}$  .  Aircraft receiving equipment that provides for automatic  DME selection assures reception of azimuth and distance  information from a common source when designated VOR/ DME, VORTAC, ILS/DME, and LOC/DME are selected.  Some aircraft have separate VOR and DME receivers, each  of which must be tuned to the appropriate navigation facility.  The airborne equipment includes an antenna and a receiver.  

The pilot-controllable features of the DME receiver include:  

# Channel (Frequency) Selector  

Many DMEs are channeled by an associated VHF radio, or  there may be a selector switch so a pilot can select which  VHF radio is channeling the DME. For a DME with its own  frequency selector, use the frequency of the associated VOR/ DME or VORTAC station.  

ON/OFF/Volume Switch  

The DME identifier is heard as a Morse code identifier with  a tone somewhat higher than that of the associated VOR or  LOC. It is heard once for every three or four times the VOR  or LOC identifier is heard. If only one identifier is heard about  every 30 seconds, the DME is functional, but the associated  VOR or LOC is not.  

Mode Switch  

The mode switch selects between distance (DIST) or distance  in NMs, groundspeed, and time to station. There may also be  one or more HOLD functions that permit the DME to stay  channeled to the station that was selected before the switch  was placed in the hold position. This is useful when you make  an ILS approach at a facility that has no collocated DME,  but there is a VOR/DME nearby.  

Altitude Some DMEs correct for slant-range error.  

# Function of DME  

A DME is used for determining the distance from a ground  DME transmitter. Compared to other VHF/UHF NAVAIDs,  a DME is very accurate. The distance information can be  used to determine the aircraft position or flying a track that  is a constant distance from the station. This is referred to as  a DME arc.  

# DME Arc  

There are many instrument approach procedures (IAPs) that  incorporate DME arcs. The procedures and techniques given  here for intercepting and maintaining such arcs are applicable  to any facility that provides DME information. Such a facility  may or may not be collocated with the facility that provides  final approach guidance.  

As an example of flying a DME arc, refer to  Figure 9-17  and  follow these steps:  

1.	 Track inbound on the OKT   $325^{\circ}$   radial, frequently  checking the DME mileage readout. 2.	 A   $0.5~\mathrm{{NM}}$   lead is satisfactory for groundspeeds of  150 knots or less; start the turn to the arc at 10.5  miles. At higher groundspeeds, use a proportionately  greater lead. 3.	 Continue the turn for approximately  $90^{\circ}$  . The roll-out  heading is  $055^{\circ}$   in a no wind condition. 4.	 During the last part of the intercepting turn, monitor  the DME closely. If the arc is being overshot (more  than  $1.0\,\mathrm{{NM})}$  ), continue through the originally planned  roll-out heading. If the arc is being undershot, roll-out  of the turn early.  

![](images/05938d207c93bf576273b500b2b96a1ee105d89aa4eac867e7a4a9663c73c958.jpg)  
Figure 9-17.   DME arc interception.  

The procedure for intercepting the   $10\,\mathrm{DMSE}$   when outbound  is basically the same, the lead point being  $10\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   minus 0.5  NM or  $9.5\;\mathrm{{NM}}$  .  

When flying a DME arc with wind, it is important to keep a  continuous mental picture of the aircraft’s position relative to  the facility. Since the wind-drift correction angle is constantly  changing throughout the arc, wind orientation is important.  In some cases, wind can be used in returning to the desired  track. High airspeeds require more pilot attention because of  the higher rate of deviation and correction.  

Maintaining the arc is simplified by keeping slightly inside  the curve; thus, the arc is turning toward the aircraft and  interception may be accomplished by holding a straight  course. When outside the curve, the arc is “turning away”  and a greater correction is required.  

To fly the arc using the VOR CDI, center the CDI needle upon  completion of the  $90^{\circ}$   turn to intercept the arc. The aircraft’s  heading is found very near the left or right side (  $270^{\circ}$   or  $90^{\circ}$  reference points) of the instrument. The readings at that side  location on the instrument give primary heading information  while on the arc. Adjust the aircraft heading to compensate  for wind and to correct for distance to maintain the correct  arc distance. Recenter the CDI and note the new primary  heading indicated whenever the CDI gets  $2^{\circ}-4^{\circ}$   from center.  

With an RMI, in a no wind condition, pilots should  theoretically be able to fly an exact circle around the facility  by maintaining an RB of   $90^{\circ}$   or   $270^{\circ}$  . In actual practice,  a series of short legs are flown. To maintain the arc in  Figure 9-18 , proceed as follows:  

1.	 With the RMI bearing pointer on the wingtip reference   $\mathrm{{}^{90^{\circ}}}$   or   $270^{\circ}$   position) and the aircraft at the desired  DME range, maintain a constant heading and allow the  bearing pointer to move  $5\mathrm{{}^{\circ}-10^{\circ}}$   behind the wingtip.  This causes the range to increase slightly. 2.	 Turn toward the facility to place the bearing pointer   $5^{\circ}-10^{\circ}$   ahead of the wingtip reference, and then  maintain heading until the bearing pointer is again  behind the wingtip. Continue this procedure to  maintain the approximate arc. 3.	 If a crosswind causes the aircraft to drift away from  the facility, turn the aircraft until the bearing pointer is  ahead of the wingtip reference. If a crosswind causes  the aircraft to drift toward the facility, turn until the  bearing is behind the wingtip. 4.	 As a guide in making range corrections, change the  RB   $10^{\circ}–20^{\circ}$   for each half-mile deviation from the  desired arc. For example, in no-wind conditions, if the  aircraft is  $\%$   to 1 mile outside the arc and the bearing  pointer is on the wingtip reference, turn the aircraft   $20^{\circ}$   toward the facility to return to the arc.  

Without an RMI, orientation is more difficult since there is  no direct azimuth reference. However, the procedure can be  flown using the OBS and CDI for azimuth information and  the DME for arc distance.  

# Intercepting Lead Radials  

A lead radial is the radial at which the turn from the arc to the  inbound course is started. When intercepting a radial from a  DME arc, the lead varies with arc radius and groundspeed.  For the average general aviation aircraft, flying arcs such  as those depicted on most approach charts at speeds of 150  knots or less, the lead is under   $5^{\circ}$  . There is no difference  between intercepting a radial from an arc and intercepting it  from a straight course.  

With an RMI, the rate of bearing movement should be  monitored closely while flying the arc. Set the course of the  radial to be intercepted as soon as possible and determine  the approximate lead. Upon reaching this point, start the  intercepting turn. Without an RMI, the technique for radial  interception is the same except for azimuth information,  which is available only from the OBS and CDI.  

![](images/ffa62364d0cda52774c9a47954aed0bbbd541a7fbf9d73396a42ca432f8a3f32.jpg)  
Figure 9-18.   Using DME and RMI to maintain an arc.  

The technique for intercepting a localizer from a DME arc  is similar to intercepting a radial. At the depicted lead radial  (LR 223 or LR 212 in  Figures 9-19, 9-20,  and  9-21 ), a  pilot having a single VOR/LOC receiver should set it to the  localizer frequency. If the pilot has dual VOR/LOC receivers,  one unit may be used to provide azimuth information and the  other set to the localizer frequency. Since these lead radials  provide   $7^{\circ}$   of lead, a half-standard rate turn should be used  until the LOC needle starts to move toward center.  

# DME Errors  

A DME/DME fix (a location based on two DME lines of  position from two DME stations) provides a more accurate  aircraft location than using a VOR and a DME fix.  

DME signals are line-of-sight; the mileage readout is the  straight line distance from the aircraft to the DME ground  facility and is commonly referred to as slant range distance.  Slant range refers to the distance from the aircraft’s antenna  to the ground station (A line at an angle to the ground  transmitter. GPS systems provide distance as the horizontal  measurement from the WP to the aircraft. Therefore, at 3,000  feet and 0.5 miles the DME (slant range) would read  $0.6\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  while the GPS distance would show the actual horizontal  distance of .5 DME. This error is smallest at low altitudes and/ or at long ranges. It is greatest when the aircraft is closer to  the facility, at which time the DME receiver displays altitude  (in NM) above the facility. Slant range error is negligible if  the aircraft is one mile or more from the ground facility for  each 1,000 feet of altitude above the elevation of the facility.

# Area Navigation (RNAV)  

Area navigation (RNAV) equipment includes VOR/DME,  LORAN, GPS, and inertial navigation systems (INS). RNAV  equipment is capable of computing the aircraft position,  actual track, groundspeed, and then presenting meaningful  information to the pilot. This information may be in the form  of distance, cross-track error, and time estimates relative to  the selected track or WP. In addition, the RNAV equipment  installations must be approved for use under IFR. The Pilot’s  Operating Handbook/Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM)  should always be consulted to determine what equipment is  installed, the operations that are approved, and the details of  equipment use. Some aircraft may have equipment that allows  input from more than one RNAV source, thereby providing  a very accurate and reliable navigation source.  

# VOR/DME RNAV  

VOR RNAV is based on information generated by the present  VORTAC or VOR/DME system to create a WP using an  airborne computer. As shown in  Figure 9-22 , the value of  side A is the measured DME distance to the VOR/DME. Side  B, the distance from the VOR/DME to the WP, and angle 1  (VOR radial or the bearing from the VORTAC to the WP)  are values set in the flight deck control. The bearing from  the VOR/DME to the aircraft, angle 2, is measured by the  VOR receiver. The airborne computer continuously compares

angles 1 and 2 and determines angle 3 and side C, which is  the distance in NMs and magnetic course from the aircraft  to the WP. This is presented as guidance information on the  flight deck display.  

# VOR/DME RNAV Components  

Although RNAV flight deck instrument displays vary among  manufacturers, most are connected to the aircraft CDI with a  switch or knob to select VOR or RNAV guidance. There is  usually a light or indicator to inform the pilot whether VOR  or RNAV is selected.  [Figure 9-23]  The display includes the  WP, frequency, mode in use, WP radial and distance, DME  distance, groundspeed, and time to station.  

![](images/c16c394bcb343210c02543aca550de850daeacfaf9ad69b84ddbe7e8a32d2ab8.jpg)  
Figure 9-23.   Onboard RNAV receivers have changed significantly.  Originally, RNAV receivers typically computed combined data  from VOR, VORTAC, and/or DME. That is generally not the case  now. Today, GPS such as the GNC 300 and the Bendix King KLS  88 LORAN receivers compute waypoints based upon embedded  databases and aircraft positional information.  

Most VOR/DME RNAV systems have the following  airborne controls:  

1.	 OFF/ON/Volume control to select the frequency of the  VOR/DME station to be used.  

2.	 MODE select switch used to select VOR/DME  mode, with: a. 	 Angular course width deviation (standard VOR  operation); or b. 	 Linear cross-track deviation as standard (  $\pm5$   NM  full scale CDI). 3.	 RNAV mode, with direct to WP with linear cross-track  deviation of  $\pm5$   NM. 4.	 RNAV/APPR (approach mode) with linear deviation  of  $\pm1.25\$   NM as full scale CDI deflection. 5.	 WP select control. Some units allow the storage of more  than one WP; this control allows selection of any WP  in storage. 6.	 Data input controls. These controls allow user input  of WP number or ident, VOR or LOC frequency, WP  radial and distance.  

While DME groundspeed readout is accurate only when  tracking directly to or from the station in VOR/DME mode,  in RNAV mode the DME groundspeed readout is accurate  on any track.  

# Function of VOR/DME RNAV  

The advantages of the VOR/DME RNAV system stem from  the ability of the airborne computer to locate a WP wherever it  is convenient, as long as the aircraft is within reception range  of both nearby VOR and DME facilities. A series of these  WPs make up an RNAV route. In addition to the published  routes, a random RNAV route may be flown under IFR if  it is approved by air traffic control (ATC). RNAV DPs and  standard terminal arrival routes (STARs) are contained in  the DP and STAR booklets.  

VOR/DME RNAV approach procedure charts are also  available. Note in the VOR/DME RNAV chart excerpt shown  in  Figure 9-24  that the WP identification boxes contain the  following information: WP name, coordinates, frequency,  identifier, radial distance (facility to WP), and reference facility  elevation. The initial approach fix (IAF), final approach fix  (FAF), and missed approach point (MAP) are labeled.  

To fly a route or to execute an approach under IFR, the RNAV  equipment installed in the aircraft must be approved for the  appropriate IFR operations.  

In vertical navigation (VNAV) mode, vertical guidance is  provided, as well as horizontal guidance in some installations.  A WP is selected at a point where the descent begins,  and another WP is selected where the descent ends. The

Figure 9-24.   VOR/DME RNAV RWY 25 approach (excerpt).  

RNAV equipment computes the rate of descent relative to  the groundspeed; on some installations, it displays vertical  guidance information on the GS indicator. When using this  type of equipment during an instrument approach, the pilot  must keep in mind that the vertical guidance information  provided is not part of the nonprecision approach. Published  nonprecision approach altitudes must be observed and  complied with, unless otherwise directed by ATC.  

To fly to a WP using RNAV, observe the following procedure  [Figure 9-25] :  

1.	 Select the VOR/DME frequency. 2.	 Select the RNAV mode. 3.	 Select the radial of the VOR that passes through the  WP   $(225^{\circ})$  . 4.	 Select the distance from the DME to the WP (12 NM). 5.	 Check and confirm all inputs, and center the CDI needle  with the TO indicator showing. 6.	 Maneuver the aircraft to fly the indicated heading plus or  minus wind correction to keep the CDI needle centered. 7.	 The CDI needle indicates distance off course of 1 NM  per dot; the DME readout indicates distance in NM  from the WP; the groundspeed reads closing speed  (knots) to the WP; and the time to station (TTS) reads  time to the WP.  

# VOR/DME RNAV Errors  

The limitation of this system is the reception volume.  Published approaches have been tested to ensure this is not

a problem. Descents/approaches to airports distant from the  VOR/DME facility may not be possible because, during  the approach, the aircraft may descend below the reception  altitude of the facility at that distance.  

# Advanced Technologies  

# Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)  

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a  constellation of satellites providing a high-frequency signal  that contains time and distance that is picked up by a receiver  thereby.  [Figure 9-26]  The receiver that picks up multiple  signals from different satellites is able to triangulate its  position from these satellites.  

![](images/8bf2c73a9209982daab9db1703a861474d83e393f09d001378921f6d1fc28a65.jpg)  
Figure 9-26.   A typical example (GNS 480) of a stand-alone GPS  receiver and display.  

Three GNSSs exist today: the GPS, a United States system; the  Russian GNSS (GLONASS); and Galileo, a European system.  

1.	 GLONASS is a network of 24 satellites that can be  picked up by any GLONASS receiver, allowing the  user to pinpoint their position.  2.	 Galileo planned to be a network of 30 satellites that  continuously transmit high-frequency radio signals  containing time and distance data that can be picked  up by a Galileo receiver with operational expectancy  by 2013. 3.	 The GPS came on line in 1992 with 24 satellites and  today utilizes 30 satellites.  

# Global Positioning System (GPS)  

The GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that  broadcasts a signal that is used by receivers to determine  precise position anywhere in the world. The receiver tracks  multiple satellites and determines a measurement that is then  used to determine the user location.  [Figure 9-27]  

The Department of Defense (DOD) developed and deployed  GPS as a space-based positioning, velocity, and time system.  The DOD is responsible for operation of the GPS satellite  constellation, and constantly monitors the satellites to ensure  proper operation. The GPS system permits Earth-centered  coordinates to be determined and provides aircraft position  referenced to the DOD World Geodetic System of 1984  (WGS-84). Satellite navigation systems are unaffected  by weather and provide global navigation coverage that  fully meets the civil requirements for use as the primary  means of navigation in oceanic airspace and certain remote  areas. Properly certified GPS equipment may be used as a  supplemental means of IFR navigation for domestic en route,  terminal operations and certain IAPs. Navigational values,

such as distance and bearing to a WP and groundspeed, are  computed from the aircraft’s current position (latitude and  longitude) and the location of the next WP. Course guidance  is provided as a linear deviation from the desired track of a  Great Circle route between defined WPs.  

GPS may not be approved for IFR use in other countries.  Prior to its use, pilots should ensure that GPS is authorized  by the appropriate countries.  

# GPS Components  

GPS consists of three distinct functional elements: space,  control, and user.  

The space element consists of over 30 Navstar satellites. This  group of satellites is called a constellation. The space element  consists of 24 Navigation System using Timing and Ranging  (NAVSTAR) satellites in 6 orbital planes.  The satellites in  each plane are spaced   $60^{\circ}$   apart for complete coverage and  are located (nominally) at about 11,000 miles above the  Earth.  The planes are arranged so that there are always five  satellites in view at any time on the Earth. Presently, there are  at least 31 Block II/IIA/IIR and IIR-M satellites in orbit with  the additional satellites representing replacement satellites  (upgraded systems) and spares. Recently, the Air Force  received funding for procurement of 31 Block IIF satellites.  The GPS constellation broadcasts a pseudo-random code  timing signal and data message that the aircraft equipment  processes to obtain satellite position and status data. By  knowing the precise location of each satellite and precisely  matching timing with the atomic clocks on the satellites, the  aircraft receiver/processor can accurately measure the time  each signal takes to arrive at the receiver and, therefore,  determine aircraft position.  

The control element consists of a network of ground-based  GPS monitoring and control stations that ensure the accuracy  of satellite positions and their clocks. In its present form, it  has five monitoring stations, three ground antennas, and a  master control station.  

The user element consists of antennas and receiver/processors  on board the aircraft that provide positioning, velocity,  and precise timing to the user. GPS equipment used while  operating under IFR must meet the standards set forth in  Technical Standard Order (TSO) C-129 (or equivalent); meet  the airworthiness installation requirements; be “approved” for  that type of IFR operation; and be operated in accordance with  the applicable POH/AFM or flight manual supplement.  

An updatable GPS database that supports the appropriate  operations (e.g., en route, terminal, and instrument  approaches) is required when operating under IFR. The  aircraft GPS navigation database contains WPs from the  geographic areas where GPS navigation has been approved  for IFR operations. The pilot selects the desired WPs from  the database and may add user-defined WPs for the flight.  

Equipment approved in accordance with TSO C-115a, visual  flight rules (VFR), and hand-held GPS systems do not meet  the requirements of TSO C-129 and are not authorized for  IFR navigation, instrument approaches, or as a principal  instrument flight reference. During IFR operations, these  units (TSO C-115a) may be considered only an aid to  situational awareness.  

Prior to GPS/WAAS IFR operation, the pilot must review  appropriate NOTAMs and aeronautical information. This  information is available on request from an flight service  station (FSS). The FAA does provide NOTAMs to advise  pilots of the status of the WAAS and level of service  available.  

# Function of GPS  

GPS operation is based on the concept of ranging and  triangulation from a group of satellites in space that act  as precise reference points. The receiver uses data from a  minimum of four satellites above the mask angle (the lowest  angle above the horizon at which it can use a satellite).  

The aircraft GPS receiver measures distance from a satellite  using the travel time of a radio signal. Each satellite transmits  a specific code, called a course/acquisition (CA) code, which  contains information about satellite position, the GPS system  time, and the health and accuracy of the transmitted data.  Knowing the speed at which the signal traveled (approximately  186,000 miles per second) and the exact broadcast time,  the distance traveled by the signal can be computed from  the arrival time. The distance derived from this method of  computing distance is called a pseudo-range because it is not  a direct measurement of distance, but a measurement based  on time. In addition to knowing the distance to a satellite, a  receiver needs to know the satellite’s exact position in space,  its ephemeris. Each satellite transmits information about its  exact orbital location. The GPS receiver uses this information  to establish the precise position of the satellite.  

Using the calculated pseudo-range and position information  supplied by the satellite, the GPS receiver/processor  mathematically determines its position by triangulation  from several satellites. The GPS receiver needs at least four  satellites to yield a three-dimensional position (latitude,  longitude, and altitude) and time solution. The GPS receiver  computes navigational values (distance and bearing to  a WP, groundspeed, etc.) by using the aircraft’s known  latitude/longitude and referencing these to a database built  into the receiver.  

The GPS receiver verifies the integrity (usability) of the  signals received from the GPS constellation through receiver  autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) to determine if a  satellite is providing corrupted information. RAIM needs  a minimum of five satellites in view or four satellites and  a barometric altimeter baro-aiding to detect an integrity  anomaly. For receivers capable of doing so, RAIM needs  six satellites in view (or five satellites with baro-aiding)  to isolate a corrupt satellite signal and remove it from the  navigation solution.  

Generally, there are two types of RAIM messages. One  type indicates that there are not enough satellites available  to provide RAIM and another type indicates that the RAIM  has detected a potential error that exceeds the limit for the  current phase of flight. Without RAIM capability, the pilot  has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position.  

Aircraft using GPS navigation equipment under IFR for  domestic en route, terminal operations, and certain IAPs,  must be equipped with an approved and operational alternate  means of navigation appropriate to the flight. The avionics  necessary to receive all of the ground-based facilities  appropriate for the route to the destination airport and any  required alternate airport must be installed and operational.  Ground-based facilities necessary for these routes must also  be operational. Active monitoring of alternative navigation  equipment is not required if the GPS receiver uses RAIM for  integrity monitoring. Active monitoring of an alternate means  of navigation is required when the RAIM capability of the  GPS equipment is lost. In situations where the loss of RAIM  capability is predicted to occur, the flight must rely on other  approved equipment, delay departure, or cancel the flight.  

# GPS Substitution  

IFR En Route and Terminal Operations  

GPS systems, certified for IFR en route and terminal  operations, may be used as a substitute for ADF and DME  receivers when conducting the following operations within  the United States NAS.  

1.	 Determining the aircraft position over a DME fix.  This includes en route operations at and above 24,000  feet mean sea level (MSL) (FL 240) when using GPS  for navigation. 2.	 Flying a DME arc. 3.	 Navigating TO/FROM an NDB/compass locator. 4.	 Determining the aircraft position over an NDB/ compass locator. 5.	 Determining the aircraft position over a fix defined  by an NDB/compass locator bearing crossing a VOR/ LOC course. 6.	 Holding over an NDB/compass locator.  

# GPS Substitution for ADF or DME  

Using GPS as a substitute for ADF or DME is subject to the  following restrictions:  

1.	 This equipment must be installed in accordance with  appropriate airworthiness installation requirements and  operated within the provisions of the applicable POH/ AFM or supplement. 2.	 The required integrity for these operations must be  provided by at least en route RAIM or equivalent. 3.	 WPs, fixes, intersections, and facility locations to be  used for these operations must be retrieved from the  GPS airborne database. The database must be current.  If the required positions cannot be retrieved from the  airborne database, the substitution of GPS for ADF and/ or DME is not authorized 4.	 Procedures must be established for use when RAIM  outages are predicted or occur. This may require the  flight to rely on other approved equipment or require  the aircraft to be equipped with operational NDB and/or  DME receivers. Otherwise, the flight must be rerouted,  delayed, canceled, or conducted under VFR. 5.	 The CDI must be set to terminal sensitivity (1  NM) when tracking GPS course guidance in the  terminal area.  

6.	 A non-GPS approach procedure must exist at the  alternate airport when one is required. If the non-GPS  approaches on which the pilot must rely require DME  or ADF, the aircraft must be equipped with DME or  ADF avionics as appropriate. 7.	 Charted requirements for ADF and/or DME can be met  using the GPS system, except for use as the principal  instrument approach navigation source.  

NOTE: The following provides guidance that is not specific  to any particular aircraft GPS system. For specific system  guidance, refer to the POH/AFM, or supplement, or contact  the system manufacturer.  

# To Determine Aircraft Position Over a DME Fix:  

1.	 Verify aircraft GPS system integrity monitoring is  functioning properly and indicates satisfactory integrity. 2.	 If the fix is identified by a five-letter name that is  contained in the GPS airborne database, select either  the named fix as the active GPS WP or the facility  establishing the DME fix as the active GPS WP. When  using a facility as the active WP, the only acceptable  facility is the DME facility that is charted as the one  used to establish the DME fix. If this facility is not in  the airborne database, it is not authorized for use. 3.	 If the fix is identified by a five-letter name that is not  contained in the GPS airborne database, or if the fix  is not named, select the facility establishing the DME  fix or another named DME fix as the active GPS WP. 4.	 When selecting the named fix as the active GPS WP,  a pilot is over the fix when the GPS system indicates  the active WP. 5.	 If selecting the DME providing facility as the active  GPS WP, a pilot is over the fix when the GPS distance  from the active WP equals the charted DME value, and  the aircraft is established on the appropriate bearing  or course.  

# To Fly a DME Arc:  

1.	 Verify aircraft GPS system integrity monitoring is  functioning properly and indicates satisfactory integrity. 2.	 Select from the airborne database the facility providing  the DME arc as the active GPS WP. The only  acceptable facility is the DME facility on which the arc  is based. If this facility is not in your airborne database,  you are not authorized to perform this operation. 3.	 Maintain position on the arc by reference to the GPS  distance instead of a DME readout.  

# To Navigate TO or FROM an NDB/Compass  Locator:  

1.	 Verify aircraft GPS system integrity monitoring is  functioning properly and indicates satisfactory integrity.

 2.	 Select the NDB/compass locator facility from the  airborne database as the active WP. If the chart depicts  the compass locator collocated with a fix of the same  name, use of that fix as the active WP in place of the  compass locator facility is authorized.

 3.	 Select and navigate on the appropriate course to or  from the active WP.  

# To Determine Aircraft Position Over an NDB/ Compass Locator:  

1.	 Verify aircraft GPS system integrity monitoring is  functioning properly and indicates satisfactory integrity.

 2.	 Select the NDB/compass locator facility from the  airborne database. When using an NDB/compass  locator, the facility must be charted and be in the  airborne database. If the facility is not in the airborne  database, pilots are not authorized to use a facility WP  for this operation.

 3.	 A pilot is over the NDB/compass locator when the  GPS system indicates arrival at the active WP.  

# To Determine Aircraft Position Over a Fix Made up  of an NDB/Compass Locator Bearing Crossing a  VOR/LOC Course:  

1.	 Verify aircraft GPS system integrity monitoring is  functioning properly and indicates satisfactory integrity.

 2.	 A fix made up by a crossing NDB/compass locator  bearing is identified by a five-letter fix name. Pilots  may select either the named fix or the NDB/compass  locator facility providing the crossing bearing to  establish the fix as the active GPS WP. When using  an NDB/compass locator, that facility must be charted  and be in the airborne database. If the facility is not  in the airborne database, pilots are not authorized to  use a facility WP for this operation.

 3.	 When selecting the named fix as the active GPS WP,  pilot is over the fix when the GPS system indicates  the pilot is at the WP.

 4.	 When selecting the NDB/compass locator facility  as the active GPS WP, pilots are over the fix when  the GPS bearing to the active WP is the same as  the charted NDB/compass locator bearing for the  fix flying the prescribed track from the non-GPS  navigation source.  

# To Hold Over an NDB/Compass Locator:  

1.	 Verify aircraft GPS system integrity monitoring is  functioning properly and indicates satisfactory integrity. 2.	 Select the NDB/compass locator facility from the  airborne database as the active WP. When using a  facility as the active WP, the only acceptable facility  is the NDB/compass locator facility which is charted.  If this facility is not in the airborne database, its use  is not authorized. 3.	 Select nonsequencing (e.g., “HOLD” or “OBS”) mode  and the appropriate course in accordance with the  POH/AFM or supplement. 4.	 Hold using the GPS system in accordance with the  POH/AFM or supplement.  

# IFR Flight Using GPS  

Preflight preparations should ensure that the GPS is properly  installed and certified with a current database for the type  of operation. The GPS operation must be conducted in  accordance with the FAA-approved POH/AFM or flight  manual supplement. Flightcrew members must be thoroughly  familiar with the particular GPS equipment installed in the  aircraft, the receiver operation manual, and the POH/AFM  or flight manual supplement. Unlike ILS and VOR, the  basic operation, receiver presentation to the pilot and some  capabilities of the equipment can vary greatly. Due to these  differences, operation of different brands or even models  of the same brand of GPS receiver under IFR should not be  attempted without thorough study of the operation of that  particular receiver and installation. Using the equipment in  flight under VFR conditions prior to attempting IFR operation  allows for further familiarization.  

Required preflight preparations should include checking  NOTAMs relating to the IFR flight when using GPS as a  supplemental method of navigation. GPS satellite outages  are issued as GPS NOTAMs both domestically and  internationally. Pilots may obtain GPS RAIM availability  information for an airport by specifically requesting GPS  aeronautical information from an FSS during preflight  briefings. GPS RAIM aeronautical information can be  obtained for a 3-hour period: the estimated time of arrival  (ETA), and 1 hour before to 1 hour after the ETA hour, or  a 24-hour time frame for a specific airport. FAA briefers  provide RAIM information for a period of 1 hour before to 1  hour after the ETA, unless a specific timeframe is requested  by the pilot. If flying a published GPS departure, the pilot  should also request a RAIM prediction for the departure  airport. Some GPS receivers have the capability to predict  RAIM availability. The pilot should also ensure that the  required underlying ground-based navigation facilities and  related aircraft equipment appropriate to the route of flight,  terminal operations, instrument approaches for the destination,  and alternate airports/heliports are operational for the ETA.  If the required ground-based facilities and equipment are  not available, the flight should be rerouted, rescheduled,  canceled, or conducted under VFR.  

Except for programming and retrieving information from  the GPS receiver, planning the flight is accomplished in a  similar manner to conventional NAVAIDs. Departure WP,  DP, route, STAR, desired approach, IAF, and destination  airport are entered into the GPS receiver according to the  manufacturer’s instructions. During preflight, additional  information may be entered for functions such as ETA, fuel  planning, winds aloft, etc.  

When the GPS receiver is turned on, it begins an internal  process of test and initialization. When the receiver is  initialized, the user develops the route by selecting a WP  or series of WPs, verifies the data, and selects the active  flight plan. This procedure varies widely among receivers  made by different manufacturers. GPS is a complex system,  offering little standardization between receiver models. It is  the pilot’s responsibility to be familiar with the operation of  the equipment in the aircraft.  

the aircraft’s present latitude and longitude to the location of  the next WP. Course guidance is provided between WPs. The  pilot has the advantage of knowing the aircraft’s actual track  over the ground. As long as track and bearing to the WP are  matched up (by selecting the correct aircraft heading), the  aircraft is going directly to the WP.  

# GPS Instrument Approaches  

There is a mixture of GPS overlay approaches (approaches  with “or GPS” in the title) and GPS stand-alone approaches  in the United States.  

NOTE: GPS instrument approach operations outside the United  States must be authorized by the appropriate country authority.  

While conducting these IAPs, ground-based NAVAIDs are  not required to be operational and associated aircraft avionics  need not be installed, operational, turned on, or monitored;  however, monitoring backup navigation systems is always  recommended when available.  

Pilots should have a basic understanding of GPS approach  procedures and practice GPS IAPs under visual meteorological  conditions (VMC) until thoroughly proficient with all  aspects of their equipment (receiver and installation) prior  to attempting flight in instrument meteorological conditions  (IMC).  [Figure 9-28]  

![](images/0de69e33f5b1509b137982c5287b047fe764817baa068fbf3e17d4a30072f3f4.jpg)  
Figure 9-28.   A GPS stand-alone approach.  

All IAPs must be retrievable from the current GPS database  supplied by the manufacturer or other FAA-approved  source. Flying point to point on the approach does not  assure compliance with the published approach procedure.  The proper RAIM sensitivity is not available and the CDI  sensitivity does not automatically change to 0.3 NM. Manually  setting CDI sensitivity does not automatically change  the RAIM sensitivity on some receivers. Some existing  nonprecision approach procedures cannot be coded for use  with GPS and are not available as overlays.  

GPS approaches are requested and approved by ATC using  the GPS title, such as “GPS RWY 24” or “RNAV RWY 35.”  Using the manufacturer’s recommended procedures, the  desired approach and the appropriate IAF are selected from  the GPS receiver database. Pilots should fly the full approach  from an initial approach waypoint (IAWP) or feeder fix unless  specifically cleared otherwise. Randomly joining an approach  at an intermediate fix does not ensure terrain clearance.  

When an approach has been loaded in the flight plan, GPS  receivers give an “arm” annunciation   $30~\mathrm{{NM}}$   straight  line distance from the airport/heliport reference point.  The approach mode should be “armed” when within 30  NM distance so the receiver changes from en route CDI   $(\pm5\;\mathrm{{NM})}$   and RAIM   $(\pm2\:\mathrm{{NM})}$   sensitivity to  $\pm1$   NM terminal  sensitivity. Where the IAWP is within   $30~\mathrm{{NM}}$  , a CDI  sensitivity change occurs once the approach mode is armed  and the aircraft is within  $30\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  . Where the IAWP is beyond  the  $30~\mathrm{{NM}}$   point, CDI sensitivity does not change until the  aircraft is within  $30\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   even if the approach is armed earlier.  Feeder route obstacle clearance is predicated on the receiver  CDI and RAIM being in terminal CDI sensitivity within  $30\,\mathrm{{NM}}$    of the airport/heliport reference point; therefore, the receiver  should always be armed no later than the  $30\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   annunciation.  

Pilots should pay particular attention to the exact operation of  their GPS receivers for performing holding patterns and in the  case of overlay approaches, operations such as procedure turns.  These procedures may require manual intervention by the pilot  to stop the sequencing of WPs by the receiver and to resume  automatic GPS navigation sequencing once the maneuver  is complete. The same WP may appear in the route of flight  more than once and consecutively (e.g., IAWP, final approach  waypoint (FAWP), missed approach waypoint (MAWP) on a  procedure turn). Care must be exercised to ensure the receiver  is sequenced to the appropriate WP for the segment of the  procedure being flown, especially if one or more fly-over WPs  are skipped (e.g., FAWP rather than IAWP if the procedure  turn is not flown). The pilot may need to sequence past one or  more fly-overs of the same WP in order to start GPS automatic  sequencing at the proper place in the sequence of WPs.  

When receiving vectors to final, most receiver operating  manuals suggest placing the receiver in the nonsequencing  mode on the FAWP and manually setting the course. This  provides an extended final approach course in cases where  the aircraft is vectored onto the final approach course outside  of any existing segment that is aligned with the runway.  Assigned altitudes must be maintained until established on a  published segment of the approach. Required altitudes at WPs  outside the FAWP or step-down fixes must be considered.  Calculating the distance to the FAWP may be required in  order to descend at the proper location.  

When within 2 NM of the FAWP with the approach mode  armed, the approach mode switches to active, which results  in RAIM and CDI sensitivity changing to the approach  mode. Beginning 2 NM prior to the FAWP, the full scale  CDI sensitivity changes smoothly from  $\pm1\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   to  $\pm0.3\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  at the FAWP. As sensitivity changes from  $\pm1$   NM to  $\pm0.3$  NM approaching the FAWP, and the CDI not centered,  the corresponding increase in CDI displacement may give  the impression the aircraft is moving further away from  the intended course even though it is on an acceptable  intercept heading. If digital track displacement information  (cross-track error) is available in the approach mode, it may  help the pilot remain position oriented in this situation.  Being established on the final approach course prior to the  beginning of the sensitivity change at 2 NM helps prevent  problems in interpreting the CDI display during ramp-down.  Requesting or accepting vectors, which causes the aircraft  to intercept the final approach course within   $2~\mathrm{{NM}}$   of the  FAWP, is not recommended.  

Incorrect inputs into the GPS receiver are especially critical  during approaches. In some cases, an incorrect entry can  cause the receiver to leave the approach mode. Overriding an  automatically selected sensitivity during an approach cancels  the approach mode annunciation. If the approach mode is  not armed by 2 NM prior to the FAWP, the approach mode  does not become active at   $2~\mathrm{{NM}}$   prior to the FAWP and  the equipment will flag. In these conditions, the RAIM and  CDI sensitivity do not ramp down, and the pilot should not  descend to minimum descent altitude (MDA) but fly to the  MAWP and execute a missed approach. The approach active  annunciator and/or the receiver should be checked to ensure  the approach mode is active prior to the FAWP.  

A GPS missed approach requires pilot action to sequence the  receiver past the MAWP to the missed approach portion of  the procedure. The pilot must be thoroughly familiar with the  activation procedure for the particular GPS receiver installed  in the aircraft and must initiate appropriate action after the  MAWP. Activating the missed approach prior to the MAWP  causes CDI sensitivity to change immediately to terminal  (  $\pm1$   NM) sensitivity, and the receiver continues to navigate  to the MAWP. The receiver does not sequence past the  MAWP. Turns should not begin prior to the MAWP. If the  missed approach is not activated, the GPS receiver displays  an extension of the inbound final approach course and the  along track distance (ATD) increases from the MAWP until  it is manually sequenced after crossing the MAWP.  

Missed approach routings in which the first track is via a course  rather than direct to the next WP require additional action  by the pilot to set the course. Being familiar with all of the  required inputs is especially critical during this phase of flight.  

# Departures and Instrument Departure Procedures  (DPs)  

The GPS receiver must be set to terminal   $(\pm1\ \mathrm{{NM})}$  ) CDI  sensitivity and the navigation routes contained in the database  in order to fly published IFR charted departures and DPs.  Terminal RAIM should be provided automatically by the  receiver. (Terminal RAIM for departure may not be available  unless the WPs are part of the active flight plan rather than  proceeding direct to the first destination.) Certain segments  of a DP may require some manual intervention by the pilot,  especially when radar vectored to a course or required to  intercept a specific course to a WP. The database may not  contain all of the transitions or departures from all runways  and some GPS receivers do not contain DPs in the database.  It is necessary that helicopter procedures be flown at 70 knots  or less since helicopter departure procedures and missed  approaches use a 20:1 obstacle clearance surface (OCS),  which is double the fixed-wing OCS. Turning areas are based  on this speed also. Missed approach routings in which the  first track is via a course rather than direct to the next WP  require additional action by the pilot to set the course. Being  familiar with all of the required inputs is especially critical  during this phase of flight.  

# GPS Errors  

Normally, with 30 satellites in operation, the GPS  constellation is expected to be available continuously  worldwide. Whenever there are fewer than 24 operational  satellites, GPS navigational capability may not be available  at certain geographic locations. Loss of signals may also  occur in valleys surrounded by high terrain, and any time  the aircraft’s GPS antenna is “shadowed” by the aircraft’s  structure (e.g., when the aircraft is banked).  

Certain receivers, transceivers, mobile radios, and portable  receivers can cause signal interference. Some VHF  transmissions may cause “harmonic interference.” Pilots  can isolate the interference by relocating nearby portable  receivers, changing frequencies, or turning off suspected  causes of the interference while monitoring the receiver’s  signal quality data page.  

GPS position data can be affected by equipment characteristics  and various geometric factors, which typically cause errors  of less than 100 feet. Satellite atomic clock inaccuracies,  receiver/processors, signals reflected from hard objects  (multi-path), ionospheric and tropospheric delays, and  satellite data transmission errors may cause small position  errors or momentary loss of the GPS signal.  

# System Status  

The status of GPS satellites is broadcast as part of the data  message transmitted by the GPS satellites. GPS status  information is also available by means of the United States  Coast Guard navigation information service: (703) 313-5907  or on the internet at www.navcen.uscg.gov. Additionally,  satellite status is available through the NOTAM system.  

The GPS receiver verifies the integrity (usability) of the  signals received from the GPS constellation through RAIM  to determine if a satellite is providing corrupted information.  At least one satellite, in addition to those required for  navigation, must be in view for the receiver to perform  the RAIM function; thus, RAIM needs a minimum of five  satellites in view or four satellites and a barometric altimeter  (baro-aiding) to detect an integrity anomaly. For receivers  capable of doing so, RAIM needs six satellites in view (or  five satellites with baro-aiding) to isolate the corrupt satellite  signal and remove it from the navigation solution.  

RAIM messages vary somewhat between receivers; however,  there are two most commonly used types. One type indicates  that there are not enough satellites available to provide RAIM  integrity monitoring and another type indicates that the RAIM  integrity monitor has detected a potential error that exceeds the  limit for the current phase of flight. Without RAIM capability,  the pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position.  

Selective Availability.  Selective availability is a method  by which the accuracy of GPS is intentionally degraded.  This feature is designed to deny hostile use of precise GPS  positioning data. Selective availability was discontinued on  May 1, 2000, but many GPS receivers are designed to assume  that selective availability is still active. New receivers may  take advantage of the discontinuance of selective availability  based on the performance values in ICAO Annex 10 and do  not need to be designed to operate outside of that performance.  

# GPS Familiarization  

Pilots should practice GPS approaches under VMC until  thoroughly proficient with all aspects of their equipment  (receiver and installation) prior to attempting flight by IFR in  IMC. Some of the tasks which the pilot should practice are:  

1. 	 Utilizing the RAIM prediction function;  2. 	 Inserting a DP into the flight plan, including setting  terminal CDI sensitivity, if required, and the conditions  under which terminal RAIM is available for departure  (some receivers are not DP or STAR capable);  3. 	 Programming the destination airport;  4. 	 Programming and flying the overlay approaches  (especially procedure turns and arcs);  5. 	 Changing to another approach after selecting  an approach;  6. 	 Programming and flying “direct” missed approaches;  7. 	 Programming and flying “routed” missed approaches;  8. 	 Entering, flying, and exiting holding patterns,  particularly on overlay approaches with a second WP  in the holding pattern;  9. 	 Programming and flying a “route” from a holding  pattern;  10. 	Programming and flying an approach with radar vectors  to the intermediate segment;  11. 	Indication of the actions required for RAIM failure  both before and after the FAWP; and  12. 	Programming a radial and distance from a VOR (often  used in departure instructions).  

# Differential Global Positioning Systems (DGPS)  

Differential global positioning systems (DGPS) are designed  to improve the accuracy of GNSS by measuring changes in  variables to provide satellite positioning corrections.  

Because multiple receivers receiving the same set of satellites  produce similar errors, a reference receiver placed at a known  location can compute its theoretical position accurately and  can compare that value to the measurements provided by the  navigation satellite signals. The difference in measurement  between the two signals is an error that can be corrected by  providing a reference signal correction.  

As a result of this differential input accuracy of the  satellite system can be increased to meters. The Wide  Area Augmentation System (WAAS) and Local Area  Augmentation System (LAAS) are examples of differential  global positioning systems.  

# Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)  

The WAAS is designed to improve the accuracy, integrity,  and availability of GPS signals. WAAS allows GPS to be  used as the aviation navigation system from takeoff through  Category I precision approaches. ICAO has defined Standards  for satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS), and Japan  and Europe are building similar systems that are planned  to be interoperable with WAAS: EGNOS, the European  Geostationary Navigation Overlay System, and MSAS,  the Japanese Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT)  Satellite-based Augmentation System. The result will be a  worldwide seamless navigation capability similar to GPS but  with greater accuracy, availability, and integrity.  

Unlike traditional ground-based navigation aids, WAAS  will cover a more extensive service area in which surveyed  wide-area ground reference stations are linked to the WAAS  network. Signals from the GPS satellites are monitored by  these stations to determine satellite clock and ephemeris  corrections. Each station in the network relays the data to a  wide-area master station where the correction information is  computed. A correction message is prepared and uplinked to  a geostationary satellite (GEO) via a ground uplink and then  broadcast on the same frequency as GPS to WAAS receivers  within the broadcast coverage area.  [Figure 9-29]  

In addition to providing the correction signal, WAAS  provides an additional measurement to the aircraft receiver,  improving the availability of GPS by providing, in effect,  an additional GPS satellite in view. The integrity of GPS is  improved through real-time monitoring, and the accuracy  is improved by providing differential corrections to reduce  errors.  [Figure 9-30]  As a result, performance improvement  is sufficient to enable approach procedures with GPS/WAAS  glidepaths. At this time the FAA has completed installation of  25 wide area ground reference systems, two master stations,  and four ground uplink stations.  

# General Requirements  

WAAS avionics must be certified in accordance with  TSO-C145A, Airborne Navigation Sensors Using the GPS  Augmented by the WAAS; or TSO-146A for stand-alone  systems. GPS/WAAS operation must be conducted in  accordance with the FAA-approved aircraft flight manual  (AFM) and flight manual supplements. Flight manual  supplements must state the level of approach procedure that  the receiver supports.  

# Instrument Approach Capabilities  

WAAS receivers support all basic GPS approach functions  and provide additional capabilities with the key benefit to  generate an electronic glidepath, independent of ground  equipment or barometric aiding. This eliminates several  problems, such as cold temperature effects, incorrect  altimeter setting, or lack of a local altimeter source, and  allows approach procedures to be built without the cost

of installing ground stations at each airport. A new class  of approach procedures, which provide vertical guidance  requirements for precision approaches, has been developed  to support satellite navigation use for aviation applications.  These new procedures called Approach with Vertical  Guidance (APV) include approaches such as the LNAV/ VNAV procedures presently being flown with barometric  vertical navigation.  

# Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS)  

LAAS is a ground-based augmentation system that uses a  GPS-reference facility located on or in the vicinity of the  airport being serviced. This facility has a reference receiver  that measures GPS satellite pseudo-range and timing and  retransmits the signal. Aircraft landing at LAAS-equipped  airports are able to conduct approaches to Category I level and  above for properly equipped aircraft.  [Figures 9-31  and  9-32]

Figure 9-30. WAAS provides performance enhancement for GPS  approach procedures through real-time monitoring.  

# Inertial Navigation System (INS)  

Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a system that navigates  precisely without any input from outside of the aircraft. It is  fully self-contained. The INS is initialized by the pilot, who  enters into the system the exact location of the aircraft on the  ground before the flight. The INS is also programmed with  WPs along the desired route of flight.  

# INS Components  

INS is considered a stand-alone navigation system, especially  when more than one independent unit is onboard. The  airborne equipment consists of an accelerometer to measure  acceleration—which, when integrated with time, gives  velocity—and gyros to measure direction.  

Later versions of the INS, called inertial reference systems  (IRS), utilize laser gyros and more powerful computers;  therefore, the accelerometer mountings no longer need to  be kept level and aligned with true north. The computer  system can handle the added workload of dealing with the  computations necessary to correct for gravitational and  directional errors. Consequently, these newer systems are  sometimes called strap down systems, as the accelerometers  and gyros are strapped down to the airframe rather than being  mounted on a structure that stays fixed with respect to the  horizon and true north.  

# INS Errors  

The principal error associated with INS is degradation of  position with time. INS computes position by starting with  accurate position input which is changed continuously as  accelerometers and gyros provide speed and direction inputs.  Both accelerometers and gyros are subject to very small  errors; as time passes, those errors probably accumulate.

Figure 9-32.   The LAAS system working with GPS satellites,  reference receivers and radio transmitters which are located on  or in the vicinity of the airport.  

While the best INS/IRS display errors of 0.1 to  $0.4\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   after  flights across the North Atlantic of 4 to 6 hours, smaller and  less expensive systems are being built that show errors of 1  to 2 NM per hour. This accuracy is more than sufficient for  a navigation system that can be combined with and updated  by GPS. The synergy of a navigation system consisting of an  INS/IRS unit in combination with a GPS resolves the errors  and weaknesses of both systems. GPS is accurate all the time  it is working but may be subject to short and periodic outages.  INS is made more accurate because it is continually updated  and continues to function with good accuracy if the GPS has  moments of lost signal.  

# Instrument Approach Systems  

Most navigation systems approved for en route and terminal  operations under IFR, such as VOR, NDB, and GPS, may also  be approved to conduct IAPs. The most common systems in  use in the United States are the ILS, simplified directional  facility (SDF), localizer-type directional aid (LDA), and  microwave landing system (MLS). These systems operate  independently of other navigation systems. There are new  systems being developed, such as WAAS and LAAS. Other  systems have been developed for special use.  

# Instrument Landing Systems (ILS)  

The ILS system provides both course and altitude guidance  to a specific runway. The ILS system is used to execute a  precision instrument approach procedure or precision approach.  [Figure 9-33]  The system consists of the following components:  

1.	 A localizer providing horizontal (left/right) guidance  along the extended centerline of the runway.  

2.	 A glideslope (GS) providing vertical (up/down)  guidance toward the runway touchdown point, usually  at a  $3^{\circ}$   slope. 3.	 Marker beacons providing range information along  the approach path. 4.	 Approach lights assisting in the transition from  instrument to visual flight.  

The following supplementary elements, though not specific  components of the system, may be incorporated to increase  safety and utility:  

1.	 Compass locators providing transition from en route  NAVAIDs to the ILS system and assisting in holding  procedures, tracking the localizer course, identifying  the marker beacon sites, and providing a FAF for  ADF approaches. 2.	 DME collocated with the GS transmitter providing  positive distance-to-touchdown information or DME  associated with another nearby facility (VOR or stand- alone), if specified in the approach procedure.  

ILS approaches are categorized into three different types of  approaches based on the equipment at the airport and the  experience level of the pilot. Category I approaches provide  for approach height above touchdown of not less than 200 feet.  Category II approaches provide for approach to a height above  touchdown of not less than 100 feet. Category III approaches  provide lower minimums for approaches without a decision  height minimum. While pilots need only be instrument rated  and the aircraft be equipped with the appropriate airborne  equipment to execute Category I approaches, Category II  and III approaches require special certification for the pilots,  ground equipment, and airborne equipment.  

# ILS Components  

Ground Components  

The ILS uses a number of different ground facilities. These  facilities may be used as a part of the ILS system, as well as  part of another approach. For example, the compass locator  may be used with NDB approaches.  

# Localizer  

The localizer (LOC) ground antenna array is located on the  extended centerline of the instrument runway of an airport,  located at the departure end of the runway to prevent it from  being a collision hazard. This unit radiates a field pattern,  which develops a course down the centerline of the runway  toward the middle markers (MMs) and outer markers  (OMs) and a similar course along the runway centerline in  the opposite direction. These are called the front and back

![](images/63aadd27f0657308098fc08dda4b69629d946c79f8391c3f95b8c66d47b937e8.jpg)

courses, respectively. The localizer provides course guidance,  transmitted at 108.1 to   $111.95~\mathrm{MHz}$   (odd tenths only),  throughout the descent path to the runway threshold from a  distance of 18 NM from the antenna to an altitude of 4,500  feet above the elevation of the antenna site.  [Figure 9-34]  

The localizer course width is defined as the angular  displacement at any point along the course between a full  “fly-left” (CDI needle fully deflected to the left) and a full 

 “fly-right” indication (CDI needle fully deflected to the right).  Each localizer facility is audibly identified by a three-letter  designator transmitted at frequent regular intervals. The ILS  identification is preceded by the letter “I” (two dots). For  example, the ILS localizer at Springfield, Missouri, transmits  the identifier ISGF. The localizer includes a voice feature on  

![](images/f5c8f73d986a4a67eb76f63e882619ff6f4f4aa9b66271a3e15d67a1b623167d.jpg)

its frequency for use by the associated ATC facility in issuing  approach and landing instructions.  

The localizer course is very narrow, normally   $5^{\circ}$  . This  results in high needle sensitivity. With this course width,  a full-scale deflection shows when the aircraft is   $2.5^{\circ}$   to  either side of the centerline. This sensitivity permits accurate  orientation to the landing runway. With no more than one- quarter scale deflection maintained, the aircraft will be  aligned with the runway.  

# Glideslope (GS)  

GS describes the systems that generate, receive, and indicate  the ground facility radiation pattern. The glidepath is the  straight, sloped line the aircraft should fly in its descent from  where the GS intersects the altitude used for approaching the  FAF to the runway touchdown zone. The GS equipment is  housed in a building approximately 750 to 1,250 feet down  the runway from the approach end of the runway and between  400 and 600 feet to one side of the centerline.  

The course projected by the GS equipment is essentially the  same as would be generated by a localizer operating on its  side. The GS projection angle is normally adjusted to   $2.5^{\circ}$    to   $3.5^{\circ}$   above horizontal, so it intersects the MM at about  200 feet and the OM at about 1,400 feet above the runway  elevation. At locations where standard minimum obstruction  clearance cannot be obtained with the normal maximum GS  angle, the GS equipment is displaced farther from the approach  end of the runway if the length of the runway permits; or the GS  angle may be increased up to  $4^{\circ}$  .  

Unlike the localizer, the GS transmitter radiates signals only  in the direction of the final approach on the front course. The  system provides no vertical guidance for approaches on the back  course. The glidepath is normally   $1.4^{\circ}$   thick. At   $10\;\mathrm{{NM}}$   from  the point of touchdown, this represents a vertical distance of  approximately 1,500 feet, narrowing to a few feet at touchdown.  

# Marker Beacons  

Two VHF marker beacons, outer and middle, are normally  used in the ILS system.  [Figure 9-35]  A third beacon, the  inner, is used where Category II operations are certified. A  marker beacon may also be installed to indicate the FAF on  the ILS back course.  

![](images/3ce2029827b92d3a436962787309b663bfead8b0cd0633b90f0d130a984ba5ab.jpg)  
Figure 9-35. Localizer receiver indications and aircraft displacement.  

The OM is located on the localizer front course 4–7 miles  from the airport to indicate a position at which an aircraft, at  the appropriate altitude on the localizer course, will intercept  the glidepath. The MM is located approximately 3,500 feet  from the landing threshold on the centerline of the localizer  front course at a position where the GS centerline is about 200  feet above the touchdown zone elevation. The inner marker  (IM), where installed, is located on the front course between  the MM and the landing threshold. It indicates the point at  which an aircraft is at the decision height on the glidepath  during a Category II ILS approach. The back-course marker,  where installed, indicates the back-course FAF.  

# Compass Locator  

Compass locators are low-powered NDBs and are received  and indicated by the ADF receiver. When used in conjunction  with an ILS front course, the compass locator facilities are  collocated with the outer and/or MM facilities. The coding  identification of the outer locator consists of the first two  letters of the three-letter identifier of the associated LOC.  For example, the outer locator at Dallas/Love Field (DAL) is  identified as “DA.” The middle locator at DAL is identified  by the last two letters “AL.”  

# Approach Lighting Systems (ALS)  

Normal approach and letdown on the ILS is divided into two  distinct stages: the instrument approach stage using only radio  guidance, and the visual stage, when visual contact with the  ground runway environment is necessary for accuracy and  safety. The most critical period of an instrument approach,  particularly during low ceiling/visibility conditions, is the  point at which the pilot must decide whether to land or  execute a missed approach. As the runway threshold is  approached, the visual glidepath separates into individual  lights. At this point, the approach should be continued by  reference to the runway touchdown zone markers. The  approach lighting system (ALS) provides lights that will  penetrate the atmosphere far enough from touchdown to  give directional, distance, and glidepath information for safe  visual transition.  

Visual identification of the ALS by the pilot must be  instantaneous, so it is important to know the type of ALS  before the approach is started. Check the instrument approach  chart and the A/FD for the particular type of lighting facilities  at the destination airport before any instrument flight. With  reduced visibility, rapid orientation to a strange runway can  be difficult, especially during a circling approach to an airport  with minimum lighting facilities or to a large terminal airport  located in the midst of distracting city and ground facility  lights. Some of the most common ALS systems are shown  in  Figure 9-36 .  

A high-intensity flasher system, often referred to as “the  rabbit,” is installed at many large airports. The flashers consist  of a series of brilliant blue-white bursts of light flashing in  sequence along the approach lights, giving the effect of a ball  of light traveling towards the runway. Typically, “the rabbit”  makes two trips toward the runway per second.  

Runway end identifier lights (REIL) are installed for rapid and  positive identification of the approach end of an instrument  runway. The system consists of a pair of synchronized  flashing lights placed laterally on each side of the runway  threshold facing the approach area.  

The visual approach slope indicator (VASI) gives visual  descent guidance information during the approach to a  runway. The standard VASI consists of light bars that  project a visual glidepath, which provides safe obstruction  clearance within the approach zone. The normal GS angle  is   $3^{\circ}$  ; however, the angle may be as high as   $4.5^{\circ}$   for proper  obstacle clearance. On runways served by ILS, the VASI  angle normally coincides with the electronic GS angle.  Visual left/right course guidance is obtained by alignment  with the runway lights. The standard VASI installation  consists of either 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, 12-, or 16-light units arranged  in downwind and upwind light bars. Some airports serving  long-bodied aircraft have three-bar VASIs that provide two  visual glidepaths to the same runway. The first glidepath  encountered is the same as provided by the standard VASI.  The second glidepath is about 25 percent higher than the first  and is designed for the use of pilots of long-bodied aircraft.  

The basic principle of VASI is that of color differentiation  between red and white. Each light projects a beam having  a white segment in the upper part and a red segment in the  lower part of the beam. From a position above the glidepath  the pilot sees both bars as white. Lowering the aircraft with  respect to the glidepath, the color of the upwind bars changes  from white to pink to red. When on the proper glidepath,  the landing aircraft will overshoot the downwind bars and  undershoot the upwind bars. Thus the downwind (closer)  bars are seen as white and the upwind bars as red. From  a position below the glidepath, both light bars are seen as  red. Moving up to the glidepath, the color of the downwind  bars changes from red to pink to white. When below the  glidepath, as indicated by a distinct all-red signal, a safe  obstruction clearance might not exist. A standard two-bar  VASI is illustrated in  Figure 9-37 .  

# ILS Airborne Components  

Airborne equipment for the ILS system includes receivers  for the localizer, GS, marker beacons, ADF, DME, and the  respective indicator instruments.  

The typical VOR receiver is also a localizer receiver with  common tuning and indicating equipment. Some receivers  have separate function selector switches, but most switch  between VOR and LOC automatically by sensing if odd  

![](images/b080e22febcd0fa799a674338c63a563baa272bb0588bef7bd4200c91c0f0d2e.jpg)  

![](images/522c5910e146e701d10702ea761b9eac1f159ca683b78fe540dc421cab26b833.jpg)  
Figure 9-36.   Precision and nonprecision ALS configuration.  

tenths between 108 and   $111.95~\mathrm{MHz}$   have been selected.  Otherwise, tuning of VOR and localizer frequencies is  accomplished with the same knobs and switches, and the CDI  indicates “on course” as it does on a VOR radial.  

Though some GS receivers are tuned separately, in a typical  installation the GS is tuned automatically to the proper  frequency when the localizer is tuned. Each of the 40 localizer  channels in the 108.10 to   $111.95\,\mathrm{MHz}$   band is paired with a  corresponding GS frequency.  

When the localizer indicator also includes a GS needle, the  instrument is often called a cross-pointer indicator. The  crossed horizontal (GS) and vertical (localizer) needles are  free to move through standard five-dot deflections to indicate  position on the localizer course and glidepath.  

When the aircraft is on the glidepath, the needle is horizontal,  overlying the reference dots. Since the glidepath is much  narrower than the localizer course (approximately  $1.4^{\circ}$   from  full up to full down deflection), the needle is very sensitive  to displacement of the aircraft from on-path alignment. With  the proper rate of descent established upon GS interception,  very small corrections keep the aircraft aligned.  

The localizer and GS warning flags disappear from view on  the indicator when sufficient voltage is received to actuate the  needles. The flags show when an unstable signal or receiver  malfunction occurs.  

The OM is identified by a low-pitched tone, continuous dashes  at the rate of two per second, and a purple/blue marker beacon  light. The MM is identified by an intermediate tone, alternate  dots and dashes at the rate of 95 dot/dash combinations per  minute, and an amber marker beacon light. The IM, where  installed, is identified by a high-pitched tone, continuous dots  at the rate of six per second, and a white marker beacon light.  The back-course marker (BCM), where installed, is identified  by a high-pitched tone with two dots at a rate of 72 to 75 two- dot combinations per minute and a white marker beacon light.  Marker beacon receiver sensitivity is selectable as high or low  on many units. The low-sensitivity position gives the sharpest  indication of position and should be used during an approach.  The high-sensitivity position provides an earlier warning that  the aircraft is approaching the marker beacon site.  

# ILS Function  

The localizer needle indicates, by deflection, whether the  aircraft is right or left of the localizer centerline, regardless of  the position or heading of the aircraft. Rotating the OBS has  no effect on the operation of the localizer needle, although  it is useful to rotate the OBS to put the LOC inbound course  under the course index. When inbound on the front course, or  outbound on the back course, the course indication remains  directional. (See  Figure 9-38,  aircraft C, D, and E.)  

Unless the aircraft has reverse sensing capability and it is in  use, when flying inbound on the back course or outbound on  the front course, heading corrections to on-course are made  opposite the needle deflection. This is commonly described  as “flying away from the needle.” (See  Figure 9-38 , aircraft A  and B.) Back course signals should not be used for an approach  unless a back course approach procedure is published for that  particular runway and the approach is authorized by ATC.  

Once you have reached the localizer centerline, maintain  the inbound heading until the CDI moves off center. Drift  corrections should be small and reduced proportionately as  the course narrows. By the time you reach the OM, your drift  correction should be established accurately enough on a well- executed approach to permit completion of the approach,  with heading corrections no greater than  $2^{\circ}$  .  

The heaviest demand on pilot technique occurs during  descent from the OM to the MM, when you maintain  the localizer course, adjust pitch attitude to maintain the  proper rate of descent, and adjust power to maintain proper  airspeed. Simultaneously, the altimeter must be checked  and preparation made for visual transition to land or for a  missed approach. You can appreciate the need for accurate  instrument interpretation and aircraft control within the ILS  as a whole, when you notice the relationship between CDI  and glidepath needle indications and aircraft displacement  from the localizer and glidepath centerlines.  

Deflection of the GS needle indicates the position of the  aircraft with respect to the glidepath. When the aircraft is  above the glidepath, the needle is deflected downward. When  the aircraft is below the glidepath, the needle is deflected  upward.  [Figure 9-39]  

# ILS Errors  

The ILS and its components are subject to certain errors,  which are listed below. Localizer and GS signals are subject to  the same type of bounce from hard objects as space waves.  

1.	 Reflection. Surface vehicles and even other aircraft  flying below 5,000 feet above ground level (AGL)  may disturb the signal for aircraft on the approach. 2.	 False courses. In addition to the desired course, GS  facilities inherently produce additional courses at  higher vertical angles. The angle of the lowest of  these false courses occurs at approximately  $9^{\circ}–12^{\circ}$  .  An aircraft flying the LOC/GS course at a constant  altitude would observe gyrations of both the GS needle  and GS warning flag as the aircraft passed through the  various false courses. Getting established on one of  these false courses results in either confusion (reversed  GS needle indications) or in the need for a very high  descent rate. However, if the approach is conducted  at the altitudes specified on the appropriate approach  chart, these false courses are not encountered.  

# Marker Beacons  

The very low power and directional antenna of the marker  beacon transmitter ensures that the signal is not received  any distance from the transmitter site. Problems with signal  reception are usually caused by the airborne receiver not  being turned on or by incorrect receiver sensitivity.

Some marker beacon receivers, to decrease weight and cost,  are designed without their own power supply. These units  utilize a power source from another radio in the avionics  stack, often the ADF. In some aircraft, this requires the ADF  to be turned on in order for the marker beacon receiver to  function, yet no warning placard is required. Another source  of trouble may be the “HIGH/LOW/OFF” three-position  switch, which both activates the receiver and selects receiver  sensitivity. Usually, the “test” feature only tests to see if  the light bulbs in the marker beacon lights are working.  Therefore, in some installations, there is no functional way  for the pilot to ascertain the marker beacon receiver is actually  on except to fly over a marker beacon transmitter and see if  a signal is received and indicated (e.g., audibly, and visually  via marker beacon lights).  

# Operational Errors  

1.	 Failure to understand the fundamentals of ILS ground  equipment, particularly the differences in course  dimensions. Since the VOR receiver is used on the  localizer course, the assumption is sometimes made  that interception and tracking techniques are identical  when tracking localizer courses and VOR radials.  Remember that the CDI sensing is sharper and faster  on the localizer course.  

2.	 Disorientation during transition to the ILS due to poor  3500  planning and reliance on one receiver instead of on all  available airborne equipment. Use all the assistance  3400  available; a single receiver may fail. Disorientation on the localizer course, due to the first  3300  error noted above. 3200  Incorrect localizer interception angles. A large  interception angle usually results in overshooting  3100  and possible disorientation. When intercepting,  if possible, turn to the localizer course heading  immediately upon the first indication of needle  movement. An ADF receiver is an excellent aid to  orient you during an ILS approach if there is a locator  or NDB on the inbound course. 5.	 Chasing the CDI and glidepath needles, especially  when you have not sufficiently studied the approach  before the flight.  

# Simplified Directional Facility (SDF)  

The simplified directional facility (SDF) provides a final  approach course similar to the ILS localizer. The SDF course  may or may not be aligned with the runway and the course  may be wider than a standard ILS localizer, resulting in less  precision. Usable off-course indications are limited to   $35^{\circ}$    either side of the course centerline. Instrument indications  in the area between  $35^{\circ}$   and  $90^{\circ}$   from the course centerline  are not controlled and should be disregarded.  

The SDF must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory  operation of a typical aircraft installation within a sector  which extends from the center of the SDF antenna system  to distances of   $18~\mathrm{{NM}}$   covering a sector   $10^{\circ}$   either side of  centerline up to an angle  $7^{\circ}$   above the horizontal. The angle  of convergence of the final approach course and the extended  runway centerline must not exceed   $30^{\circ}$  . Pilots should note  this angle since the approach course originates at the antenna  site, and an approach continued beyond the runway threshold  would lead the aircraft to the SDF offset position rather than  along the runway centerline.  

The course width of the SDF signal emitted from the  transmitter is fixed at either  $6^{\circ}$   or  $12^{\circ}$  , as necessary, to provide  maximum flyability and optimum approach course quality.  A three-letter identifier is transmitted in code on the SDF  frequency; there is no letter “I” (two dots) transmitted before  the station identifier, as there is with the LOC. For example,  the identifier for Lebanon, Missouri, SDF is LBO.  

# Localizer Type Directional Aid (LDA)  

The localizer type directional aid (LDA) is of comparable  utility and accuracy to a localizer but is not part of a  complete ILS. The LDA course width is between  $3^{\circ}$   and  $6^{\circ}$  and thus provides a more precise approach course than an  SDF installation. Some LDAs are equipped with a GS. The  LDA course is not aligned with the runway, but straight-in  minimums may be published where the angle between the  runway centerline and the LDA course does not exceed  $30^{\circ}$  . If  this angle exceeds  $30^{\circ}$  , only circling minimums are published.  The identifier is three letters preceded by “I” transmitted in  code on the LDA frequency. For example, the identifier for  Van Nuys, California, LDA is I-BUR.  

# Microwave Landing System (MLS)  

The microwave landing system (MLS) provides precision  navigation guidance for exact alignment and descent of aircraft  on approach to a runway. It provides azimuth, elevation, and  distance. Both lateral and vertical guidance may be displayed  on conventional course deviation indicators or incorporated  into multipurpose flight deck displays. Range information  can be displayed by conventional DME indicators and also  incorporated into multipurpose displays.  [Figure 9-40]  

The system may be divided into five functions, which are  approach azimuth, back azimuth, approach elevation, range;  and data communications. The standard configuration of  MLS ground equipment includes an azimuth station to  

![](images/a75b17a8eba4b774ba7cf6181020629f5286e5adf9b7bfa16808ef764d5f174b.jpg)  
Figure 9-40.   MLS coverage volumes, 3-D representation.  

perform functions as indicated above. In addition to providing  azimuth navigation guidance, the station transmits basic data,  which consists of information associated directly with the  operation of the landing system, as well as advisory data on  the performance of the ground equipment.  

# Approach Azimuth Guidance  

The azimuth station transmits MLS angle and data on one  of 200 channels within the frequency range of 5031 to 5091  MHz. The equipment is normally located about 1,000 feet  beyond the stop end of the runway, but there is considerable  flexibility in selecting sites. For example, for heliport  operations the azimuth transmitter can be collocated with  the elevation transmitter. The azimuth coverage extends  laterally at least  $40^{\circ}$   on either side of the runway centerline  in a standard configuration, in elevation up to an angle of  $15^{\circ}$    and to at least 20,000 feet, and in range to at least  $20\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  .  

MLS requires separate airborne equipment to receive and  process the signals from what is normally installed in general  aviation aircraft today. It has data communications capability,  and can provide audible information about the condition  of the transmitting system and other pertinent data such as  weather, runway status, etc. The MLS transmits an audible  identifier consisting of four letters beginning with the letter  M, in Morse code at a rate of at least six per minute. The  MLS system monitors itself and transmits ground-to-air data  messages about the system’s operational condition. During  periods of routine or emergency maintenance, the coded  identification is missing from the transmissions. At this time  there are only a few systems installed.  

# Required Navigation Performance  

RNP is a navigation system that provides a specified level  of accuracy defined by a lateral area of confined airspace in  which an RNP-certified aircraft operates. The continuing  growth of aviation places increasing demands on airspace  capacity and emphasizes the need for the best use of the  available airspace. These factors, along with the accuracy of  modern aviation navigation systems and the requirement for  increased operational efficiency in terms of direct routings  and track-keeping accuracy, have resulted in the concept  of required navigation performance—a statement of the  navigation performance accuracy necessary for operation  within a defined airspace. RNP can include both performance  and functional requirements and is indicated by the RNP type.  These standards are intended for designers, manufacturers,  and installers of avionics equipment, as well as service  providers and users of these systems for global operations.  The minimum aviation system performance specification  (MASPS) provides guidance for the development of airspace  and operational procedures needed to obtain the benefits of  improved navigation capability.  [Figure 9-41]  

The RNP type defines the total system error (TSE) that  is allowed in lateral and longitudinal dimensions within  a particular airspace. The TSE, which takes account of  navigation system errors (NSE), computation errors, display  errors and flight technical errors (FTE), must not exceed the  specified RNP value for 95 percent of the flight time on any  part of any single flight. RNP combines the accuracy standards  laid out in the ICAO Manual (Doc 9613) with specific accuracy  requirements, as well as functional and performance standards,  for the RNAV system to realize a system that can meet future  air traffic management requirements. The functional criteria  for RNP address the need for the flightpaths of participating  aircraft to be both predictable and repeatable to the declared  levels of accuracy. More information on RNP is contained in  subsequent chapters.  

The term RNP is also applied as a descriptor for airspace,  routes, and procedures (including departures, arrivals,  and IAPs). The descriptor can apply to a unique approach  procedure or to a large region of airspace. RNP applies to  navigation performance within a designated airspace and  includes the capability of both the available infrastructure  (navigation aids) and the aircraft.  

RNP type is used to specify navigation requirements for the  airspace. The following are ICAO RNP Types: RNP-1.0,  RNP-4.0, RNP-5.0, and RNP-10.0. The required performance  is obtained through a combination of aircraft capability and  the level of service provided by the corresponding navigation  infrastructure. From a broad perspective:  

In this context, aircraft capability refers to the airworthiness  certification and operational approval elements (including  avionics, maintenance, database, human factors, pilot  procedures, training, and other issues). The level of service  element refers to the NAS infrastructure, including published  routes, signal-in-space performance and availability, and air  traffic management. When considered collectively, these  elements result in providing access. Access provides the  desired benefit (airspace, procedures, routes of flight, etc.).  

RNP levels are actual distances from the centerline of the  flightpath, which must be maintained for aircraft and obstacle  separation. Although additional FAA-recognized RNP  levels may be used for specific operations, the United States  currently supports three standard RNP levels:  

• 	 RNP 0.3 – Approach • 	 RNP 1.0 – Departure, Terminal • 	 RNP 2.0 – En route  

RNP 0.3 represents a distance of   $0.3\ \mathrm{NM}$   either side of a  specified flightpath centerline. The specific performance that  is required on the final approach segment of an instrument  approach is an example of this RNP level. At the present  time, a 0.3 RNP level is the lowest level used in normal  RNAV operations. Specific airlines, using special procedures,  are approved to use RNP levels lower than RNP 0.3, but  those levels are used only in accordance with their approved  operations specifications (OpsSpecs). For aircraft equipment to  qualify for a specific RNP type, it must maintain navigational  accuracy at least 95 percent of the total flight time.  

# Flight Management Systems (FMS)  

A flight management system (FMS) is not a navigation  system in itself. Rather, it is a system that automates the  tasks of managing the onboard navigation systems. FMS may  perform other onboard management tasks, but this discussion  is limited to its navigation function.  

FMS is an interface between flight crews and flightdeck  systems. FMS can be thought of as a computer with a large  database of airport and NAVAID locations and associated  data, aircraft performance data, airways, intersections,  DPs, and STARs. FMS also has the ability to accept and  store numerous user-defined WPs, flight routes consisting  of departures, WPs, arrivals, approaches, alternates, etc.  FMS can quickly define a desired route from the aircraft’s  current position to any point in the world, perform flight  plan computations, and display the total picture of the flight  route to the crew.  

![](images/ed97c8a09b5f039b5116337728457726af8265a342b9efa97254998a9afb1754.jpg)  
Figure 9-41 .  Required navigation performance.  

FMS also has the capability of controlling (selecting) VOR,  DME, and LOC NAVAIDs, and then receiving navigational  data from them. INS, LORAN, and GPS navigational data  may also be accepted by the FMS computer. The FMS may  act as the input/output device for the onboard navigation  systems, so that it becomes the “go-between” for the crew  and the navigation systems.  

# Function of FMS  

At startup, the crew programs the aircraft location, departure  runway, DP (if applicable), WPs defining the route, approach  procedure, approach to be used, and routing to alternate. This  may be entered manually, be in the form of a stored flight  plan, or be a flight plan developed in another computer and  transferred by disk or electronically to the FMS computer.  The crew enters this basic information in the control/display  unit (CDU).  [Figure 9-42]  

Once airborne, the FMS computer channels the appropriate  NAVAIDs and takes radial/distance information or  channels two NAVAIDs, taking the more accurate distance  information. FMS then indicates position, track, desired  heading, groundspeed, and position relative to desired track.  Position information from the FMS updates the INS. In more  sophisticated aircraft, the FMS provides inputs to the HSI,  RMI, glass flight deck navigation displays, head-up display  (HUD), autopilot, and autothrottle systems.  

# Head-Up Display (HUD)  

The HUD is a display system that provides a projection of  navigation and air data (airspeed in relation to approach  reference speed, altitude, left/right and up/down GS) on a  transparent screen between the pilot and the windshield.  Other information may be displayed, including a runway  target in relation to the nose of the aircraft. This allows the  pilot to see the information necessary to make the approach  while also being able to see out the windshield, which  diminishes the need to shift between looking at the panel to  looking outside. Virtually any information desired can be  displayed on the HUD if it is available in the aircraft’s flight  computer and if the display is user definable.  [Figure 9-43]  

# Radar Navigation (Ground-Based)  

Radar works by transmitting a pulse of RF energy in a specific  direction. The return of the echo or bounce of that pulse from  a target is precisely timed. From this, the distance traveled  by the pulse and its echo is determined and displayed on a  radar screen in such a manner that the distance and bearing to  this target can be instantly determined. The radar transmitter  must be capable of delivering extremely high power levels  toward the airspace under surveillance, and the associated  radar receiver must be able to detect extremely small signal  levels of the returning echoes.  

The radar display system provides the controller with a map- like presentation upon which appear all the radar echoes  of aircraft within detection range of the radar facility. By  means of electronically-generated range marks and azimuth- indicating devices, the controller can locate each radar target  with respect to the radar facility, or can locate one radar target  with respect to another.  

Another device, a video-mapping unit, generates an actual  airway or airport map and presents it on the radar display  equipment. Using the video-mapping feature, the air traffic  controller not only can view the aircraft targets, but can see  these targets in relation to runways, navigation aids, and  hazardous ground obstructions in the area. Therefore, radar  becomes a NAVAID, as well as the most significant means  of traffic separation.  

In a display presenting perhaps a dozen or more targets,  a primary surveillance radar system cannot identify one  specific radar target, and it may have difficulty “seeing” a  small target at considerable distance—especially if there is  a rain shower or thunderstorm between the radar site and  the aircraft. This problem is solved with the Air Traffic  Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), sometimes  called secondary surveillance radar (SSR), which utilizes  a transponder in the aircraft. The ground equipment is an  interrogating unit, in which the beacon antenna is mounted  so it rotates with the surveillance antenna. The interrogating

Although the Universal CDU is not  typically found on smaller general aviation aircraft, the difference in capabilities of the CDUs and stand-alone sytems is diminishing each year.

unit transmits a coded pulse sequence that actuates the aircraft  transponder. The transponder answers the coded sequence  by transmitting a preselected coded sequence back to the  ground equipment, providing a strong return signal and  positive aircraft identification, as well as other special data  such as aircraft altitude.  

# Functions of Radar Navigation  

The radar systems used by ATC are air route surveillance  radar (ARSR), airport surveillance radar (ASR), and  precision approach radar (PAR) and airport surface detection  equipment (ASDE). Surveillance radars scan through  $360^{\circ}$  of azimuth and present target information on a radar display  located in a tower or center. This information is used  independently or in conjunction with other navigational aids  in the control of air traffic.  

ARSR is a long-range radar system designed primarily to  cover large areas and provide a display of aircraft while en  route between terminal areas. The ARSR enables air route  traffic control center (ARTCC) controllers to provide radar  service when the aircraft are within the ARSR coverage.  In some instances, ARSR may enable ARTCC to provide  terminal radar services similar to but usually more limited  than those provided by a radar approach control.  

ASR is designed to provide relatively short-range coverage  in the general vicinity of an airport and to serve as an  expeditious means of handling terminal area traffic through  observation of precise aircraft locations on a radarscope.  Nonprecision instrument approaches are available at airports  that have an approved surveillance radar approach procedure.  ASR provides radar vectors to the final approach course and  then azimuth information to the pilot during the approach.  In addition to range (distance) from the runway, the pilot  is advised of MDA, when to begin descent, and when the  aircraft is at the MDA. If requested, recommended altitudes  are furnished each mile while on final.  

PAR is designed to be used as a landing aid displaying range,  azimuth, and elevation information rather than as an aid for  sequencing and spacing aircraft. PAR equipment may be  used as a primary landing aid, or it may be used to monitor  other types of approaches. Two antennas are used in the PAR  array: one scanning a vertical plane and the other scanning  horizontally. Since the range is limited to 10 miles, azimuth  to  $20^{\circ}$  , and elevation to   $7^{\circ}$  , only the final approach area is  covered. The controller’s scope is divided into two parts. The  upper half presents altitude and distance information, and the  lower half presents azimuth and distance.  

PAR is a system in which a controller provides highly  accurate navigational guidance in azimuth and elevation  to a pilot. Pilots are given headings to fly to direct them to  and keep their aircraft aligned with the extended centerline  of the landing runway. They are told to anticipate glidepath  interception approximately 10–30 seconds before it occurs  and when to start descent. The published decision height (DH)  is given only if the pilot requests it. If the aircraft is observed  to deviate above or below the glidepath, the pilot is given  the relative amount of deviation by use of terms “slightly” or  “well” and is expected to adjust the aircraft’s rate of descent/ ascent to return to the glidepath. Trend information is also  issued with respect to the elevation of the aircraft and may  be modified by the terms “rapidly” and “slowly” (e.g., “well  above glidepath, coming down rapidly”).  

Range from touchdown is given at least once each mile. If  an aircraft is observed by the controller to proceed outside  of specified safety zone limits in azimuth and/or elevation  and continue to operate outside these prescribed limits, the  pilot will be directed to execute a missed approach or to fly a  specified course unless the pilot has the runway environment  (runway, approach lights, etc.) in sight. Navigational  guidance in azimuth and elevation is provided to the pilot  until the aircraft reaches the published decision altitude (DA)/ DH. Advisory course and glidepath information is furnished  by the controller until the aircraft passes over the landing  threshold, at which point the pilot is advised of any deviation  from the runway centerline. Radar service is automatically  terminated upon completion of the approach.  

4.	 Relatively low altitude aircraft are not seen if they are  screened by mountains or are below the radar beam  due to curvature of the Earth.  

5.	 The amount of reflective surface of an aircraft  determines the size of the radar return. Therefore,  a small light airplane or a sleek jet fighter is more  difficult to see on primary radar than a large  commercial jet or military bomber.  

6.	 All ARTCC radar in the conterminous United States  and many ASR have the capability to interrogate Mode  C and display altitude information to the controller  from appropriately-equipped aircraft. However,  a number of ASR do not have Mode C display  capability; therefore, altitude information must be  obtained from the pilot.  

# Airport Surface Detection Equipment  

Radar equipment is specifically designed to detect all  principal features on the surface of an airport, including  aircraft and vehicular traffic, and to present the entire image  on a radar indicator console in the control tower. It is used  to augment visual observation by tower personnel of aircraft  and/or vehicular movements on runways and taxiways.  

# Radar Limitations  

1.	 It is very important for the aviation community to  recognize the fact that there are limitations to radar  service and that ATC may not always be able to issue  traffic advisories concerning aircraft which are not  under ATC control and cannot be seen on radar. 2.	 The characteristics of radio waves are such that they  normally travel in a continuous straight line unless  they are “bent” by abnormal atmospheric phenomena  such as temperature inversions; reflected or attenuated  by dense objects such as heavy clouds, precipitation,  ground obstacles, mountains, etc.; or screened by high  terrain features. 3.	 Primary radar energy that strikes dense objects is  reflected and displayed on the operator’s scope,  thereby blocking out aircraft at the same range and  greatly weakening or completely eliminating the  display of targets at a greater range.  

# Chapter 10 IFR Flight  

# Introduction  

This chapter is a discussion of conducting a flight under  instrument flight rules (IFR). It also explains the sources for  flight planning, the conditions associated with instrument  flight, and the procedures used for each phase of IFR flight:  departure, en route, and approach. The chapter concludes  with an example of an IFR flight that applies many of the  procedures discussed in the chapter.  

# Sources of Flight Planning Information  

The following resources are available for a pilot planning a  flight conducted under IFR.  

National Aeronautical Navigation Products (AeroNav  Products) Group publications:  

•	 IFR en route charts •	 Area charts  •	 United States Terminal Procedures Publications (TPP)  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications:  

•	 Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) •	 Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) •	 Notices to Airmen Publication (NTAP) for flight  planning in the National Airspace System (NAS)  

Pilots should also consult the Pilot’s Operating Handbook/ Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM) for flight planning  information pertinent to the aircraft to be flown.  

A review of the contents of all the listed publications helps  determine which material should be referenced for each flight.  As a pilot becomes more familiar with these publications, the  flight planning process becomes quicker and easier.  

# Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)  

The AIM provides the aviation community with basic  flight information and air traffic control (ATC) procedures  used in the United States NAS. An international version  called the Aeronautical Information Publication contains  parallel information, as well as specific information on the  international airports used by the international community.  

# Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD)  

The A/FD contains information on airports, communications,  and navigation aids (NAVAIDs) pertinent to IFR flight. It  also includes very-high frequency omnidirectional range  (VOR) receiver checkpoints, flight service station (FSS),  weather service telephone numbers, and air route traffic  control center (ARTCC) frequencies. Various special  notices essential to flight are also included, such as land- and-hold-short operations (LAHSO) data, the civil use of  military fields, continuous power facilities, and special  flight procedures.  

In the major terminal and en route environments, preferred  routes have been established to guide pilots in planning their  routes of flight, to minimize route changes, and to aid in the  orderly management of air traffic using the Federal airways.  The A/FD lists both high and low altitude preferred routes.  

# Notices to Airmen Publication (NTAP)  

The NTAP is a publication containing current Notices to  Airmen (NOTAMs) that are essential to the safety of flight,  as well as supplemental data affecting the other operational  publications listed. It also includes current Flight Data Center  (FDC) NOTAMs, which are regulatory in nature, issued to  establish restrictions to flight or to amend charts or published  instrument approach procedures (IAPs).  

# POH/AFM  

The POH/AFM contain operating limitations, performance,  normal and emergency procedures, and a variety of other  operational information for the respective aircraft. Aircraft  manufacturers have done considerable testing to gather and  substantiate the information in the aircraft manual. Pilots should  refer to it for information relevant to a proposed flight.  

# IFR Flight Plan  

As specified in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 91, no person may operate an aircraft in  controlled airspace under IFR unless that person has filed  an IFR flight plan. Flight plans may be submitted to the  nearest FSS or air traffic control tower (ATCT) either in  person, by telephone (1-800-WX-BRIEF), by computer  (using the direct user access terminal system (DUATS)),  or by radio if no other means are available. Pilots should  file IFR flight plans at least 30 minutes prior to estimated  time of departure to preclude possible delay in receiving a  departure clearance from ATC. The AIM provides guidance  for completing and filing FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan.  These forms are available at flight service stations (FSSs)  and are generally found in flight planning rooms at airport  terminal buildings.  [Figure 10-1]  

# Filing in Flight  

IFR flight plans may be filed from the air under various  conditions, including:  

1.	 A flight outside controlled airspace before proceeding  into IFR conditions in controlled airspace. 2.	 A visual flight rules (VFR) flight expecting IFR  weather conditions en route in controlled airspace.  

In either of these situations, the flight plan may be filed with  the nearest FSS or directly with the ARTCC. A pilot who  files with the FSS submits the information normally entered  during preflight filing, except for “point of departure,”  together with present position and altitude. FSS then relays  this information to the ARTCC. The ARTCC then clears the  pilot from present position or from a specified navigation fix.  

![](images/3922b3f1aae11c101af92cf36f4f703763d357cadcac93b4393b3527cee6d08e.jpg)  
Figure 10-1 .  Flight plan form.  

A pilot who files directly with the ARTCC reports present  position and altitude, and submits only the flight plan  information normally relayed from the FSS to the ARTCC.  Be aware that traffic saturation frequently prevents ARTCC  personnel from accepting flight plans by radio. In such  cases, a pilot is advised to contact the nearest FSS to file  the flight plan.  

# Cancelling IFR Flight Plans  

An IFR flight plan may be cancelled any time a pilot is  operating in VFR conditions outside Class A airspace by  stating “cancel my IFR flight plan” to the controller or air-to- ground station. After cancelling an IFR flight plan, the pilot  should change to the appropriate air-to-ground frequency,  transponder code as directed, and VFR altitude/flight level.  

ATC separation and information services (including radar  services, where applicable) are discontinued when an IFR  flight plan is cancelled. If VFR radar advisory service is  desired, a pilot must specifically request it. Be aware that  other procedures may apply when cancelling an IFR flight  plan within areas such as Class C or Class B airspace.  

When operating on an IFR flight plan to an airport with  an operating control tower, a flight plan is cancelled  automatically upon landing. If operating on an IFR flight  plan to an airport without an operating control tower, the  pilot is responsible for cancelling the flight plan. This can  be done by telephone after landing if there is no operating  FSS or other means of direct communications with ATC.  When there is no FSS or air-to-ground communications are  not possible below a certain altitude, a pilot may cancel an  IFR flight plan while still airborne and able to communicate  with ATC by radio. If using this procedure, be certain the  remainder of the flight can be conducted under VFR. It is  essential that IFR flight plans be cancelled expeditiously. This  allows other IFR traffic to utilize the airspace.  

# Clearances  

An ATC clearance allows an aircraft to proceed under  specified traffic conditions within controlled airspace  for the purpose of providing separation between known  aircraft. A major contributor to runway incursions is lack  of communication with ATC and not understanding the  instructions that they give. The primary way the pilot and  ATC communicate is by voice. The safety and efficiency  of taxi operations at airports with operating control towers  depend on this communication loop. ATC uses standard  phraseology and require readbacks and other responses from  the pilot in order to verify that clearances and instructions  are understood. In order to complete the communication  loop, the controllers must also clearly understand the pilot’s  readback and other responses. Pilots can help enhance the  controller’s understanding by responding appropriately and  using standard phraseology. Regulatory requirements, the  AIM, approved flight training programs, and operational  manuals provide information for pilots on standard ATC  phraseology and communications requirements.  

# Examples  

A flight filed for a short distance at a relatively low altitude  in an area of low traffic density might receive a clearance  as follows:  

“Cessna 1230 Alpha, cleared to Doeville airport direct,  cruise 5,000.”  

The term “cruise” in this clearance means a pilot is authorized  to fly at any altitude from the minimum IFR altitude up to  and including 5,000 feet and may level off at any altitude  within this block of airspace. A climb or descent within the  block may be made at the pilot’s discretion. However, once  a pilot reports leaving an altitude within the block, the pilot  may not return to that altitude without further ATC clearance.  

When ATC issues a cruise clearance in conjunction with  an unpublished route, an appropriate crossing altitude is  specified to ensure terrain clearance until the aircraft reaches a  fix, point, or route where the altitude information is available.  The crossing altitude ensures IFR obstruction clearance to  the point at which the aircraft enters a segment of a published  route or IAP.  

Once a flight plan is filed, ATC issues the clearance with  appropriate instructions, such as the following:  

“Cessna 1230 Alpha is cleared to Skyline airport via  the Crossville 055 radial, Victor 18, maintain 5,000.  Clearance void if not off by 1330.”  

Or a more complex clearance, such as:  

“Cessna 1230 Alpha is cleared to Wichita Mid- continent airport via Victor 77, left turn after takeoff,  proceed direct to the Oklahoma City VORTAC.  Hold west on the Oklahoma City 277 radial, climb to  5,000 in holding pattern before proceeding on course.  Maintain 5,000 to CASHION intersection. Climb to  and maintain 7,000. Departure control frequency will  be 121.05, Squawk 0412.”  

Clearance delivery may issue the following “abbreviated  clearance” which includes a departure procedure (DP):  

“Cessna 1230 Alpha, cleared to La Guardia as filed,  RINGOES 8 departure Phillipsburg transition,  

maintain 8,000. Departure control frequency will be  120.4, Squawk 0700.”  

This clearance may be readily copied in shorthand as follows:  

The information contained in this DP clearance is abbreviated  using clearance shorthand (see appendix 1). The pilot should  know the locations of the specified navigation facilities,  together with the route and point-to-point time, before  accepting the clearance.  

The DP enables a pilot to study and understand the details  of a departure before filing an IFR flight plan. It provides  the information necessary to set up communication and  navigation equipment and be ready for departure before  requesting an IFR clearance.  

Once the clearance is accepted, a pilot is required to comply  with ATC instructions. A clearance different from that issued  may be requested if the pilot considers another course of  action more practicable or if aircraft equipment limitations  or other considerations make acceptance of the clearance  inadvisable.  

A pilot should also request clarification or amendment, as  appropriate, any time a clearance is not fully understood  or considered unacceptable for safety of flight. The pilot  is responsible for requesting an amended clearance if ATC  issues a clearance that would cause a pilot to deviate from  a rule or regulation or would place the aircraft in jeopardy.  

# Clearance Separations  

ATC provides the pilot on an IFR clearance with separation  from other IFR traffic. This separation is provided:  

1.	 Vertically—by assignment of different altitudes. 2.	 Longitudinally—by controlling time separation  between aircraft on the same course. 3.	 Laterally—by assignment of different flightpaths. 4.	 By radar—including all of the above.  

ATC does not provide separation for an aircraft operating:  

1.	 Outside controlled airspace. 2.	 On an IFR clearance: a)	 With “VFR-On-Top” authorized instead of a  specific assigned altitude. b) 	 Specifying climb or descent in “VFR conditions.” c)	 At any time in VFR conditions, since uncontrolled  VFR flights may be operating in the same  airspace.  

In addition to heading and altitude assignments, ATC  occasionally issues speed adjustments to maintain the  required separations. For example:  

“Cessna 30 Alpha, slow to 100 knots.”  

A pilot who receives speed adjustments is expected to  maintain that speed plus or minus 10 knots. If for any reason  the pilot is not able to accept a speed restriction, the pilot  should advise ATC.  

At times, ATC may also employ visual separation techniques  to keep aircraft safely separated. A pilot who obtains visual  contact with another aircraft may be asked to maintain visual  separation or to follow the aircraft. For example:  

“Cessna 30 Alpha, maintain visual separation with  that traffic, climb and maintain 7,000.”  

The pilot’s acceptance of instructions to maintain visual  separation or to follow another aircraft is an acknowledgment  that the aircraft is maneuvered as necessary to maintain safe  separation. It is also an acknowledgment that the pilot accepts  the responsibility for wake turbulence avoidance.  

In the absence of radar contact, ATC relies on position reports  to assist in maintaining proper separation. Using the data  transmitted by the pilot, the controller follows the progress of  each flight. ATC must correlate the pilots’ reports to provide  separation; therefore, the accuracy of each pilot’s report can  affect the progress and safety of every other aircraft operating  in the area on an IFR flight plan.  

# Departure Procedures (DPs)  

Instrument departure procedures are preplanned IFR  procedures that provide obstruction clearance from the  terminal area to the appropriate en route structure and provide  the pilot with a way to depart the airport and transition to the  en route structure safely. Pilots operating under 14 CFR part  91 are strongly encouraged to file and fly a DP when one is  available.  [Figure 10-2]  

There are two types of DPs: Obstacle Departure Procedures  (ODP), printed either textually or graphically, and Standard  Instrument Departures (SID), always printed graphically. All  DPs, either textual or graphic, may be designed using either  conventional or area navigation (RNAV) criteria. RNAV  procedures have RNAV printed in the title (e.g., SHEAD  TWO DEPARTURE (RNAV)).  

# Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP)  

ODPs provide obstruction clearance via the least onerous  route from the terminal area to the appropriate en route  structure. ODPs are recommended for obstruction clearance  and may be flown without ATC clearance unless an  alternate departure procedure (SID or radar vector) has  been specifically assigned by ATC. Graphic ODPs have  (OBSTACLE) printed in the procedure title (e.g., GEYSR  THREE DEPARTURE (OBSTACLE),  CROWN ONE  DEPARTURE (RNAV)(OBSTACLE)).  

# Standard Instrument Departures  

SIDs are ATC procedures printed for pilot/controller use in  graphic form to provide obstruction clearance and a transition  from the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure.  SIDs are primarily designed for system enhancement and to  reduce pilot/controller workload. ATC clearance must be  received prior to flying a SID.  

ODPs are found in section C of each booklet published  regionally by the AeroNav Products, TPP, along with “IFR  Take-off Minimums” while SIDs are collocated with the  approach procedures for the applicable airport. Additional  information on the development of DPs can be found in  paragraph 5-2-7 of the AIM. However, the following points  are important to remember.  

1.	 The pilot of IFR aircraft operating from locations  where DP procedures are effective may expect an ATC  clearance containing a DP. The use of a DP requires  pilot possession of at least the textual description of  the approved DP. 2.	 If a pilot does not possess a preprinted DP or for  any other reason does not wish to use a DP, he or  she is expected to advise ATC. Notification may  be accomplished by filing “NO DP” in the remarks  section of the filed flight plan or by advising ATC. 3.	 If a DP is accepted in a clearance, a pilot must comply  with it.  

# Radar-Controlled Departures  

On IFR departures from airports in congested areas, a pilot  normally receives navigational guidance from departure  control by radar vector. When a departure is to be vectored  immediately following takeoff, the pilot is advised before  takeoff of the initial heading to be flown. This information is  vital in the event of a loss of two-way radio communications  during departure.  

The radar departure is normally simple. Following takeoff,  contact departure control on the assigned frequency when  advised to do so by the control tower. At this time, departure  control verifies radar contact and gives headings, altitude, and  climb instructions to move an aircraft quickly and safely out  of the terminal area. A pilot is expected to fly the assigned  headings and altitudes until informed by the controller of  the aircraft’s position with respect to the route given in  

![](images/c774c53133a4d45589343bf0fbbdc86225c871a8bb4090b09c26c12633ca8917.jpg)  
Figure 10-2 .  Departure procedure   $(D P)$  

the clearance, whom to contact next, and to “resume own  navigation.”  

Departure control provides vectors to either a navigation  facility, or an en route position appropriate to the departure  clearance, or transfer to another controller with further radar  surveillance capabilities.  [Figure 10-2]  

A radar controlled departure does not relieve the pilot of  responsibilities as pilot-in-command. Be prepared before  takeoff to conduct navigation according to the ATC clearance  with navigation receivers checked and properly tuned. While  under radar control, monitor instruments to ensure continuous  orientation to the route specified in the clearance and record  the time over designated checkpoints.  

# Departures From Airports Without an Operating  Control Tower  

When departing from airports that have neither an operating  tower nor an FSS, a pilot should telephone the flight plan  to the nearest ATC facility at least 30 minutes before the  estimated departure time. If weather conditions permit, depart  VFR and request IFR clearance as soon as radio contact is  established with ATC.  

If weather conditions make it undesirable to fly VFR,  telephone clearance request. In this case, the controller would  probably issue a short-range clearance pending establishment  of radio contact and might restrict the departure time to a  certain period. For example:  

“Clearance void if not off by 0900.”  

This would authorize departure within the allotted period and  permit a pilot to proceed in accordance with the clearance. In  the absence of any specific departure instructions, a pilot would  be expected to proceed on course via the most direct route.  

# En Route Procedures  

Procedures en route vary according to the proposed route,  the traffic environment, and the ATC facilities controlling  the flight. Some IFR flights are under radar surveillance and  controlled from departure to arrival and others rely entirely  on pilot navigation.  

Where ATC has no jurisdiction, it does not issue an IFR  clearance. It has no control over the flight, nor does the pilot  have any assurance of separation from other traffic.  

# ATC Reports  

All pilots are required to report unforecast weather conditions  or other information related to safety of flight to ATC. The  pilot-in-command of each aircraft operated in controlled  airspace under IFR shall report as soon as practical to  ATC any malfunctions of navigational, approach, or  communication equipment occurring in flight:  

1.	 Loss of VOR, tactical air navigation (TACAN) or  automatic direction finder (ADF) receiver capability. 2.	 Complete or partial loss of instrument landing system  (ILS) receiver capability. 3.	 Impairment of air-to-ground communications  capability.  

The pilot-in-command shall include within the report  (1) aircraft identification, (2) equipment affected, (3) degree  to which the pilot to operate under IFR within the ATC  system is impaired, and (4) nature and extent of assistance  desired from ATC.  

# Position Reports  

Position reports are required over each compulsory reporting  point (shown on the chart as a solid triangle) along the route  being flown regardless of altitude, including those with  a VFR-on-top clearance. Along direct routes, reports are  required of all IFR flights over each point used to define  the route of flight. Reports at reporting points (shown as an  open triangle) are made only when requested by ATC. A  pilot should discontinue position reporting over designated  reporting points when informed by ATC that the aircraft  is in “RADAR CONTACT.” Position reporting should be  resumed when ATC advises “RADAR CONTACT LOST”  or “RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED.”  

Position reports should include the following items:  

1.	 Identification 2.	 Position 3.	 Time 4.	 Altitude or flight level (include actual altitude or flight  level when operating on a clearance specifying VFR- on-top) 5.	 Type of flight plan (not required in IFR position reports  made directly to ARTCCs or approach control) 6.	 Estimated time of arrival (ETA) and name of next  reporting point 7.	 The name only of the next succeeding reporting point  along the route of flight 8.	 Pertinent remarks  

En route position reports are submitted normally to  the ARTCC controllers via direct controller-to-pilot  communications channels using the appropriate ARTCC  frequencies listed on the en route chart.  

Whenever an initial contact with a controller is to be followed  by a position report, the name of the reporting point should  be included in the call-up. This alerts the controller that such  information is forthcoming. For example:  

“Atlanta Center, Cessna 1230 Alpha at JAILS  intersection.” “Cessna 1230 Alpha Atlanta Center.” “Atlanta Center, Cessna 1230 Alpha at JAILS  intersection, 5,000, estimating Monroeville at 1730.”  

# Additional Reports  

In addition to required position reports, the following reports  should be made to ATC without a specific request.  

1. At all times:  

a)	 When vacating any previously assigned altitude  or flight level for a newly assigned altitude or  flight level b)	 When an altitude change is made if operating on  a clearance specifying VFR-on-top c)	 When unable to climb/descend at a rate of at least  500 feet per minute (fpm) d)	 When an approach has been missed (Request  clearance for specific action (to alternative  airport, another approach, etc.)) e)	 Change in average true airspeed (at cruising  altitude) when it varies by 5 percent or 10 knots  (whichever is greater) from that filed in the flight  plan f)	 The time and altitude upon reaching a holding fix  or point to which cleared g)	 When leaving any assigned holding fix or point 	 NOTE: The reports in (f) and (g) may be omitted  by pilots of aircraft involved in instrument  training at military terminal area facilities when  radar service is being provided. h)	 Any loss in controlled airspace of VOR,  TACAN, ADF, low frequency navigation  receiver capability, global positioning system  (GPS) anomalies while using installed IFR- certified GPS/Global Navigation Satellite  Systems (GNSS) receivers, complete or partial  loss of ILS receiver capability, or impairment of  air/ground communications capability. Reports  should include aircraft identification, equipment  affected, degree to which the capability to operate  under IFR in the ATC system is impaired, and  the nature and extent of assistance desired from  ATC. i)	 Any information relating to the safety of flight. When not in radar contact: a)	 When leaving the final approach fix inbound on  final approach (nonprecision approach), or when  leaving the outer marker or fix used in lieu of the  outer marker inbound on final approach (precision  approach). b)	 A corrected estimate at any time it becomes  apparent that an estimate as previously submitted  

Any pilot who encounters weather conditions that have not  been forecast, or hazardous conditions which have been  forecast, is expected to forward a report of such weather to  ATC.  

# Planning the Descent and Approach  

ATC arrival procedures and flight deck workload are affected  by weather conditions, traffic density, aircraft equipment,  and radar availability.  

When landing at an airport with approach control services and  where two or more IAPs are published, information on the  type of approach to expect is provided in advance of arrival  or vectors are provided to a visual approach. This information  is broadcast either on automated terminal information  service (ATIS) or by a controller. It is not furnished when  the visibility is 3 miles or more and the ceiling is at or above  the highest initial approach altitude established for any low  altitude IAP for the airport.  

The purpose of this information is to help the pilot plan arrival  actions; however, it is not an ATC clearance or commitment  and is subject to change. Fluctuating weather, shifting  winds, blocked runway, etc., are conditions that may result  in changes to the approach information previously received.  It is important for a pilot to advise ATC immediately if he  or she is unable to execute the approach or prefers another  type of approach.  

If the destination is an airport without an operating control  tower and has automated weather data with broadcast  capability, the pilot should monitor the automated surface  observing system/automated weather observing system  (ASOS/AWOS) frequency to ascertain the current weather for  the airport. ATC should be advised that weather information  has been received and what the pilot’s intentions are.  

When the approach to be executed has been determined, the  pilot should plan for and request a descent to the appropriate  altitude prior to the initial approach fix (IAF) or transition  route depicted on the IAP. When flying the transition route,  a pilot should maintain the last assigned altitude until ATC  gives the instructions “cleared for the approach.” Lower  altitudes can be requested to bring the transition route  altitude closer to the required altitude at the initial approach  fix. When ATC uses the phrase “at pilot’s discretion” in the  altitude information of a clearance, the pilot has the option  to start a descent at any rate and may level off temporarily  at any intermediate altitude. However, once an altitude has  been vacated, return to that altitude is not authorized without  a clearance. When ATC has not used the term “at pilot’s  discretion” nor imposed any descent restrictions, initiate  descent promptly upon acknowledgment of the clearance.  

Descend at an optimum rate (consistent with the operating  characteristics of the aircraft) to 1,000 feet above the assigned  altitude. Then attempt to descend at a rate of between 500 and  1,500 fpm until the assigned altitude is reached. If at anytime  a pilot is unable to maintain a descent rate of at least  $500\,\mathrm{fpm}$  ,  advise ATC. Also advise ATC if it is necessary to level off  at an intermediate altitude during descent. An exception to  this is when leveling off at 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL)  on descent or 2,500 feet above airport elevation (prior to  entering a Class B, Class C, or Class D surface area) when  required for speed reduction.  

# Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs)  

Standard Terminal Arrival Routes (STARs) (as described  in Chapter 1) have been established to simplify clearance  delivery procedures for arriving aircraft at certain areas  having high density traffic. A STAR serves a purpose  parallel to that of a DP for departing traffic.  [Figure 10-3]  

![](images/7bb14343aca49459a105324366adb1f07c7ceb6f655aee8d73f047826020d287.jpg)  
Figure 10-3 .  Standard terminal arrival route (STAR).  

The following points regarding STARs are important to  remember:  

1.	 All STARs are contained in the Terminal Procedures  Publication (TPP), along with the IAP charts for the  destination airport. The AIM also describes STAR  procedures. 2.	 If the destination is a location for which STARs  have been published, a pilot may be issued a  clearance containing a STAR whenever ATC deems  it appropriate. To accept the clearance, a pilot must  possess at least the approved textual description. 3.	 It is the pilot’s responsibility to either accept or refuse  an issued STAR. If a STAR will not or cannot be used,  advise ATC by placing “NO STAR” in the remarks  section of the filed flight plan or by advising ATC. 4.	 If a STAR is accepted in a clearance, compliance is  mandatory.  

# Substitutes for Inoperative or Unusable  Components  

The basic ground components of an ILS are the localizer,  glideslope, outer marker, middle marker, and inner marker  (when installed). A compass locator or precision radar may  be substituted for the outer or middle marker. Distance  measuring equipment (DME), VOR, or nondirectional  beacon (NDB) fixes authorized in the standard IAP or  surveillance radar may be substituted for the outer marker.  

Additionally, IFR-certified GPS equipment, operated in  accordance with Advisory Circular (AC) 90-94, Guidelines  for Using Global Positioning System Equipment for IFR  En Route and Terminal Operations and for Nonprecision  Instrument Approaches in the United States National  Airspace System, may be substituted for ADF and DME  equipment, except when flying NDB IAP. Specifically, GPS  can be substituted for ADF and DME equipment when:  

1.	 Flying a DME arc; 2.	 Navigating TO/FROM an NDB; 3.	 Determining the aircraft position over an NDB; 4.	 Determining the aircraft position over a fix made up  of a crossing NDB bearing; 5.	 Holding over an NDB; 6.	 Determining aircraft position over a DME fix.  

# Holding Procedures  

Depending upon traffic and weather conditions, holding may  be required. Holding is a predetermined maneuver that keeps  aircraft within a specified airspace while awaiting further  clearance from ATC. A standard holding pattern uses right  turns, and a nonstandard holding pattern uses left turns. The  ATC clearance always specifies left turns when a nonstandard  pattern is to be flown.  

# Standard Holding Pattern (No Wind)  

In a standard holding pattern with no winds  [Figure 10-4],  the  aircraft follows the specified course inbound to the holding  fix, turns   $180^{\circ}$   to the right, flies a parallel straight course  outbound for 1 minute, turns   $180^{\circ}$   to the right, and flies the  inbound course to the fix.  

![](images/91b31c5ad1ff1ec4233b77b3a2b62be20cc07450dd1cc6b6bc467c10d64c965b.jpg)  
Figure 10-4 .  Standard holding pattern—no wind. Figure 10-4.   Standard holding pattern - no winid.  

# Standard Holding Pattern (With Wind)  

A standard symmetrical holding pattern cannot be flown  when winds exist. In those situations, the pilot is expected to:  

1.	 Compensate for the effect of a known wind except  when turning. 2.	 Adjust outbound timing to achieve a 1-minute   $\it{(1\%}$  minutes above 14,000 feet) inbound leg.  

Figure 10-5  illustrates the holding track followed with a left  crosswind. The effect of wind is counteracted by applying  drift corrections to the inbound and outbound legs and by  applying time allowances to the outbound leg.  

# Holding Instructions  

If an aircraft arrives at a clearance limit before receiving  clearance beyond the fix, ATC expects the pilot to maintain  the last assigned altitude and begin holding in accordance  with the charted holding pattern. If no holding pattern is  charted and holding instructions have not been issued, enter  a standard holding pattern on the course on which the aircraft  approached the fix and request further clearance as soon as  possible. Normally, when no delay is anticipated, ATC issues  holding instructions at least 5 minutes before the estimated  arrival at the fix. Where a holding pattern is not charted, the  ATC clearance specifies the following:  

1.	 Direction of holding from the fix in terms of the eight  cardinal compass points (N, NE, E, SE, etc.)  

![](images/f9bc8a2c2e9048b148ee3961e93b40b43fd3fbf79737cdcd016ffb94a4aba551.jpg)  
Figure 10-5 .  Drift correction in holding pattern.  

2.	 Holding fix (the fix may be omitted if included at the  beginning of the transmission as the clearance limit) 3.	 Radial, course, bearing, airway, or route on which the  aircraft is to hold. 4.	 Leg length in miles if DME or RNAV is to be used  (leg length is specified in minutes on pilot request or  if the controller considers it necessary). 5.	 Direction of turn, if left turns are to be made, because  the pilot requests or the controller considers it  necessary. 6.	 Time to expect-further-clearance (EFC) and any  pertinent additional delay information.  

ATC instructions are also issued whenever:  

1.	 It is determined that a delay will exceed 1 hour. 2.	 A revised EFC is necessary. 3.	 In a terminal area having a number of NAVAIDs  and approach procedures, a clearance limit may not  indicate clearly which approach procedures will  be used. On initial contact, or as soon as possible  thereafter, approach control advises the pilot of the  type of approach to expect. 4.	 Ceiling and/or visibility is reported as being at or  below the highest “circling minimums” established  

for the airport concerned. ATC transmits a report of  current weather conditions and subsequent changes,  as necessary.  

5.	 An aircraft is holding while awaiting approach  clearance, and the pilot advises ATC that reported  weather conditions are below minimums applicable  to the operation. In this event, ATC issues suitable  instructions to aircraft desiring either to continue  holding while awaiting weather improvement or  proceed to another airport.  

# Standard Entry Procedures  

The entry procedures given in the AIM evolved from  extensive experimentation under a wide range of operational  conditions. The standardized procedures should be followed  to ensure that an aircraft remains within the boundaries of  the prescribed holding airspace.  

When a speed reduction is required, start the reduction when  3 minutes or less from the holding fix. Cross the holding fix  initially at or below the maximum holding airspeed (MHA).  The purpose of the speed reduction is to prevent overshooting  the holding airspace limits, especially at locations where  adjacent holding patterns are close together.  

All aircraft may hold at the following altitudes and maximum  holding airspeeds:  

Altitude Mean Sea Level (MSL)	      Airspeed (KIAS)  

Up to 6,000 feet	 	 	 200 6,001 – 14,000 feet		 	 230 14,001 feet and above	 	 265  

The following are exceptions to the maximum holding  airspeeds:  

1.	 Holding patterns from 6,001 to 14,000 feet may  be restricted to a maximum airspeed of 210 knots  indicated airspeed (KIAS). This nonstandard pattern  is depicted by an icon. 2.	 Holding patterns may be restricted to a maximum  airspeed of 175 KIAS. This nonstandard pattern is  depicted by an icon. Holding patterns restricted to  175 KIAS are generally found on IAPs applicable to  category A and B aircraft only. 3.	 Holding patterns at Air Force airfields only—310  KIAS maximum, unless otherwise depicted. 4.	 Holding patterns at Navy airfields only—230 KIAS  maximum, unless otherwise depicted. 5.	 The pilot of an aircraft unable to comply with  maximum airspeed restrictions should notify ATC.  

While other entry procedures may enable the aircraft to  enter the holding pattern and remain within protected  airspace, the parallel, teardrop, and direct entries are the  procedures for entry and holding recommended by the  FAA. Additionally, paragraph 5-3-7 in the AIM should be  reviewed.  [Figure 10-6]  

1.	 Parallel Procedure. When approaching the holding fix  from anywhere in sector (a), fly to the fix. Afterwards,  turn to a heading to parallel the holding course  outbound. Fly outbound for 1 minute, turn in the  direction of the holding pattern through more than   $180^{\circ}$  , and return to the holding fix or intercept the  holding course inbound.  

2.	 Teardrop Procedure. When approaching the holding  fix from anywhere in sector (b), the teardrop entry  procedure would be to fly to the fix, turn outbound to  a heading for a  $30^{\circ}$   teardrop entry within the pattern  (on the holding side) for a period of 1 minute, then  turn in the direction of the holding pattern to intercept  the inbound holding course.  

3.	 Direct Entry Procedure. When approaching the  holding fix from anywhere in sector (c), the direct  entry procedure would be to fly directly to the fix and  turn to follow the holding pattern.  

![](images/d0394c16182f80b9605fd2ccdb1cfb2f9133039b65bd3482741622cfff454a8d.jpg)  
Figure 10-6 .  Holding pattern entry procedures.  

A pilot should make all turns during entry and while holding at:  

1.	  $3^{\circ}$   per second, or 2.	  $30^{\circ}$   bank angle, or 3.	 A bank angle provided by a flight director system.  

# Time Factors  

The holding pattern entry time reported to ATC is the initial  time of arrival over the fix. Upon entering a holding pattern, the  initial outbound leg is flown for 1 minute at or below 14,000  feet MSL, and for  $1\%$   minutes above 14,000 feet MSL. Timing  for subsequent outbound legs should be adjusted as necessary  to achieve proper inbound leg time. The pilot should begin  outbound timing over or abeam the fix, whichever occurs later.  If the abeam position cannot be determined, start timing when  the turn to outbound is completed.  [Figure 10-7]

Figure 10-7 Holding—outbound timing.  

Time leaving the holding fix must be known to ATC before  succeeding aircraft can be cleared to the vacated airspace.  Leave the holding fix:  

1.	 When ATC issues either further clearance en route or  approach clearance; 2.	 As prescribed in 14 CFR part 91 (for IFR operations;  two-way radio communications failure, and  responsibility and authority of the pilot-in-command);  or 3.	 After the IFR flight plan has been cancelled, if the  aircraft is holding in VFR conditions.  

# DME Holding  

The same entry and holding procedures apply to DME  holding, but distances (nautical miles) are used instead of  time values. The length of the outbound leg is specified by  the controller, and the end of this leg is determined by the  DME readout.  

# Approaches  

# Compliance With Published Standard Instrument  Approach Procedures  

Compliance with the approach procedures shown on the  approach charts provides necessary navigation guidance  information for alignment with the final approach courses,  as well as obstruction clearance. Under certain conditions,  a course reversal maneuver or procedure turn may be  necessary. However, this procedure is not authorized when:  

1.	 The symbol “NoPT” appears on the approach course  on the plan view of the approach chart. 2.	 Radar vectoring is provided to the final approach  course. 3.	 A holding pattern is published in lieu of a procedure  turn. 4.	 Executing a timed approach from a holding fix. 5.	 Otherwise directed by ATC.  

# Instrument Approaches to Civil Airports  

Unless otherwise authorized, when an instrument letdown to  an airport is necessary, the pilot should use a standard IAP  prescribed for that airport. IAPs are depicted on IAP charts  and are found in the TPP.  

ATC approach procedures depend upon the facilities available  at the terminal area, the type of instrument approach executed,  and the existing weather conditions. The ATC facilities,  NAVAIDs, and associated frequencies appropriate to each  standard instrument approach are given on the approach  chart. Individual charts are published for standard approach  procedures associated with the following types of facilities:  

1.	 Nondirectional beacon (NDB) 2.	 Very-high frequency omnirange (VOR) 3.	 Very-high frequency omnirange with distance  measuring equipment (VORTAC or VOR/DME) 4.	 Localizer (LOC) 5.	 Instrument landing system (ILS) 6.	 Localizer-type directional aid (LDA) 7.	 Simplified directional facility (SDF) 8.	 Area navigation (RNAV) 9.	 Global positioning system (GPS)  

An IAP can be flown in one of two ways: as a full approach  or with the assistance of radar vectors. When the IAP is flown  as a full approach, pilots conduct their own navigation using  the routes and altitudes depicted on the instrument approach  chart. A full approach allows the pilot to transition from  the en route phase, to the instrument approach, and then to  a landing with minimal assistance from ATC. This type of  procedure may be requested by the pilot but is most often  used in areas without radar coverage. A full approach also  provides the pilot with a means of completing an instrument  approach in the event of a communications failure.  

When an approach is flown with the assistance of radar  vectors, ATC provides guidance in the form of headings and  altitudes, which position the aircraft to intercept the final  approach. From this point, the pilot resumes navigation,  intercepts the final approach course, and completes the  approach using the IAP chart. This is often a more expedient  method of flying the approach, as opposed to the full  approach, and allows ATC to sequence arriving traffic. A  pilot operating in radar contact can generally expect the  assistance of radar vectors to the final approach course.  

# Approach to Airport Without an Operating Control  Tower  

Figure 10-8  shows an approach procedure at an airport  without an operating control tower. When approaching  such a facility, the pilot should monitor the AWOS/ASOS  if available for the latest weather conditions. When direct  communication between the pilot and controller is no  longer required, the ARTCC or approach controller issues a  clearance for an instrument approach and advises “change to  advisory frequency approved.” When the aircraft arrives on  a “cruise” clearance, ATC does not issue further clearance  for approach and landing.  

If an approach clearance is required, ATC authorizes the pilots  to execute his or her choice of standard instrument approach  (if more than one is published for the airport) with the

phrase “Cleared for the approach” and the communications  frequency change required, if any. From this point on, there  is no contact with ATC. The pilot is responsible for closing  the IFR flight plan before landing, if in VFR conditions, or  by telephone after landing.  

Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, a pilot is expected to  execute the complete IAP shown on the chart.  

# Approach to Airport With an Operating Tower,  With No Approach Control  

When an aircraft approaches an airport with an operating  control tower, but no approach control, ATC issues a  clearance to an approach/outer fix with the appropriate  information and instructions as follows:  

1.	 Name of the fix 2.	 Altitude to be maintained 3.	 Holding information and expected approach clearance  time, if appropriate  4.	 Instructions regarding further communications,  including: a)	 facility to be contacted b)	 time and place of contact c)	 frequency/ies to be used  

If ATIS is available, a pilot should monitor that frequency  for information such as ceiling, visibility, wind direction and  velocity, altimeter setting, instrument approach, and runways  in use prior to initial radio contact with the tower. If ATIS is  not available, ATC provides weather information from the  nearest reporting station.  

# Approach to an Airport With an Operating Tower,  With an Approach Control  

Where radar is approved for approach control service, it is  used to provide vectors in conjunction with published IAPs.  Radar vectors can provide course guidance and expedite  traffic to the final approach course of any established IAP. Figure 10-9  shows an IAP chart with maximum ATC  facilities available.  

Approach control facilities that provide this radar service  operate in the following manner:  

1.	 Arriving aircraft are either cleared to an outer fix most  appropriate to the route being flown with vertical  separation and, if required, given holding information;  or, 2.	 When radar hand-offs are effected between ARTCC  and approach control, or between two approach  

control facilities, aircraft are cleared to the airport or  to a fix so located that the hand-off is completed prior  to the time the aircraft reaches the fix.  

a)	 When the radar hand-offs are utilized, successive  arriving flights may be handed off to approach  control with radar separation in lieu of vertical  separation. b)	 After hand-off to approach control, an aircraft  is vectored to the appropriate final approach  course.  

3.	 Radar vectors and altitude/flight levels are issued  as required for spacing and separating aircraft; do  not deviate from the headings issued by approach  control.  

4.	 Aircraft are normally informed when it becomes  necessary to be vectored across the final approach  course for spacing or other reasons. If approach  course crossing is imminent and the pilot has not  been informed that the aircraft will be vectored across  the final approach course, the pilot should query the  controller. The pilot is not expected to turn inbound on  the final approach course unless an approach clearance  has been issued. This clearance is normally issued with  the final vector for interception of the final approach  course, and the vector enables the pilot to establish the  aircraft on the final approach course prior to reaching  the final approach fix.  

5.	 Once the aircraft is established inbound on the final  approach course, radar separation is maintained with  other aircraft, and the pilot is expected to complete  the approach using the NAVAID designated in the  clearance (ILS, VOR, NDB, GPS, etc.) as the primary  means of navigation. 6.	 After passing the final approach fix inbound, the  pilot is expected to proceed direct to the airport and  complete the approach or to execute the published  missed approach procedure. 7.	 Radar service is automatically terminated when the  landing is completed or when the pilot is instructed to  change to advisory frequency at uncontrolled airports,  whichever occurs first.  

# Radar Approaches  

With a radar approach, the pilot receives course and altitude  guidance from a controller who monitors the progress of the  flight with radar. This is an option should the pilot experience  an emergency or distress situation.  

The only airborne radio equipment required for radar  approaches is a functioning radio transmitter and receiver.  

![](images/5ee079067017876acb01421310234319d69cc32dd5152c8e3c75fc9f3ef260bf.jpg)  
Figure 10-9 .  Gulfport, Mississippi (GPT) ILS or LOC Rwy 14 Approach: An instrument procedure chart with maximum ATC facilities  Figure 10-9.   Approach: an instrument procedure chart with maximum ATC facilities available.  available.  

The radar controller vectors the aircraft to align it with the  runway centerline. The controller continues the vectors to  keep the aircraft on course until the pilot can complete the  approach and landing by visual reference to the surface.  There are two types of radar approaches: Precision (PAR)  and Surveillance (ASR).  

A radar approach may be given to any aircraft upon request  and may be offered to pilots of aircraft in distress or to expedite  traffic; however, an ASR might not be approved unless  there is an ATC operational requirement or in an unusual  or emergency situation. Acceptance of a PAR or ASR by a  pilot does not waive the prescribed weather minimums for the  airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned. The  decision to make a radar approach when the reported weather  is below the established minimums rests with the pilot.  

PAR and ASR minimums are published on separate pages  in the FAA TPP.  Figure 10-10 .  

PAR is one in which a controller provides highly accurate  navigational guidance in azimuth and elevation to a pilot.  

The controller gives the pilot headings to fly that direct the  aircraft to, and keep the aircraft aligned with, the extended  centerline of the landing runway. The pilot is told to anticipate  glidepath interception approximately 10 to 30 seconds before  it occurs and when to start descent. The published decision  height (DH) is given only if the pilot requests it. If the aircraft  is observed to deviate above or below the glidepath, the pilot  is given the relative amount of deviation by use of terms  “slightly” or “well” and is expected to adjust the aircraft’s rate  of descent/ascent to return to the glidepath. Trend information  is also issued with respect to the elevation of the aircraft and  may be modified by the terms “rapidly” and “slowly” (e.g.,  “well above glidepath, coming down rapidly”).  

Range from touchdown is given at least once each mile. If  an aircraft is observed by the controller to proceed outside of  specified safety zone limits in azimuth and/or elevation and  continue to operate outside these prescribed limits, the pilot  is directed to execute a missed approach or to fly a specified  course unless the pilot has the runway environment (runway,  approach lights, etc.) in sight. Navigational guidance in  azimuth and elevation is provided to the pilot until the aircraft  reaches the published DH. Advisory course and glidepath  information is furnished by the controller until the aircraft  passes over the landing threshold. At this point, the pilot is  advised of any deviation from the runway centerline. Radar  service is automatically terminated upon completion of the  approach.  

# ASR is one in which a controller provides navigational  guidance in azimuth only.  

The controller furnishes the pilot with headings to fly to  align the aircraft with the extended centerline of the landing  runway. Since the radar information used for a surveillance  approach is considerably less precise than that used for a  precision approach, the accuracy of the approach is not as  great and higher minimums apply. Guidance in elevation  is not possible, but the pilot is advised when to commence  

![](images/e1cca7eb7aafe2e0f95f6adb9f4de6d9f6f97612b18280467ddf188aca46e99f.jpg)

descent to the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) or, if  appropriate, to an intermediate step-down fix Minimum  Crossing Altitude (MCA) and subsequently to the prescribed  MDA. In addition, the pilot is advised of the location of the  Missed Approach Point (MAP) prescribed for the procedure  and the aircraft’s position each mile on final from the runway,  airport, heliport, or MAP, as appropriate.  

If requested by the pilot, recommended altitudes are issued  at each mile, based on the descent gradient established for  the procedure, down to the last mile that is at or above the  MDA. Normally, navigational guidance is provided until the  aircraft reaches the MAP.  

Radar service is automatically terminated at the completion  of a radar approach.  

No-Gyro Approach is available to a pilot under radar control  who experiences circumstances wherein the directional gyro  or other stabilized compass is inoperative or inaccurate. When  this occurs, the pilot should so advise ATC and request a no- gyro vector or approach. The pilot of an aircraft not equipped  with a directional gyro or other stabilized compass who  desires radar handling may also request a no-gyro vector or  approach. The pilot should make all turns at standard rate  and should execute the turn immediately upon receipt of  instructions. For example, “TURN RIGHT,” “STOP TURN.”  When a surveillance or precision approach is made, the  pilot is advised after the aircraft has been turned onto final  approach to make turns at half standard rate.  

# Radar Monitoring of Instrument Approaches  

PAR facilities operated by the FAA and the military services  at some joint-use (civil and military) and military installations  monitor aircraft on instrument approaches and issue radar  advisories to the pilot when weather is below VFR minimums  (1,000 and 3), at night, or when requested by a pilot. This  service is provided only when the PAR Final Approach  Course coincides with the final approach of the navigational  aid and only during the operational hours of the PAR. The  radar advisories serve only as a secondary aid since the pilot  has selected the NAVAID as the primary aid for the approach.  

Prior to starting final approach, the pilot is advised of the  frequency on which the advisories are transmitted. If, for  any reason, radar advisories cannot be furnished, the pilot  is so advised.  

Advisory information, derived from radar observations,  includes information on:  

2.	 Trend advisories with respect to elevation and/or  azimuth radar position and movement are provided.  3.	 If, after repeated advisories, the aircraft proceeds  outside the PAR safety limit or if a radical deviation  is observed, the pilot is advised to execute a missed  approach unless the prescribed visual reference with  the surface is established.  

Radar service is automatically terminated upon completion  of the approach.  [Figure 10-11]  

# Timed Approaches From a Holding Fix  

Timed approaches from a holding fix are conducted when  many aircraft are waiting for an approach clearance. Although  the controller does not specifically state “timed approaches  are in progress,” the assigning of a time to depart the FAF  inbound (nonprecision approach), or the outer marker or fix  used in lieu of the outer marker inbound (precision approach),  indicates that timed approach procedures are being utilized.  

In lieu of holding, the controller may use radar vectors to the  final approach course to establish a distance between aircraft  that ensures the appropriate time sequence between the FAF  and outer marker or fix used in lieu of the outer marker and  the airport. Each pilot in the approach sequence is given  advance notice of the time they should leave the holding point  on approach to the airport. When a time to leave the holding  point is received, the pilot should adjust the flightpath in order  to leave the fix as closely as possible to the designated time.  

Timed approaches may be conducted when the following  conditions are met:  

1.	 A control tower is in operation at the airport where  the approaches are conducted. 2.	 Direct communications are maintained between the  pilot and the Center or approach controller until the  pilot is instructed to contact the tower. 3.	 If more than one MAP is available, none require a  course reversal. 4.	 If only one MAP is available, the following conditions  are met: a)	 Course reversal is not required; and b)	 Reported ceiling and visibility are equal to or  greater than the highest prescribed circling  minimums for the IAP. 5.	 When cleared for the approach, pilots should not  execute a procedure turn.  

1.	 Passing the final approach fix inbound (nonprecision  approach) or passing the outer marker or fix used in  lieu of the outer marker inbound (precision approach).

# Approaches to Parallel Runways  

Procedures permit ILS instrument approach operations to dual  or triple parallel runway configurations. A parallel approach  is an ATC procedure that permits parallel ILS approach to  airports with parallel runways separated by at least 2,500  feet between centerlines. Wherever parallel approaches  are in progress, pilots are informed that approaches to both  runways are in use.  

Simultaneous approaches are permitted to runways:  

1.	 With centerlines separated by 4,300 to 9,000 feet; 2.	 Equipped with final monitor controllers; 3.	 Requiring radar monitoring to ensure separation  between aircraft on the adjacent parallel approach  course.  

The approach procedure chart includes the note “simultaneous  approaches authorized RWYS 14L and 14R,” identifying  the appropriate runways. When advised that simultaneous  parallel approaches are in progress, pilots must advise  approach control immediately of malfunctioning or  inoperative components.  

Parallel approach operations demand heightened pilot  situational awareness. The close proximity of adjacent  aircraft conducting simultaneous parallel approaches  mandates strict compliance with all ATC clearances and  approach procedures. Pilots should pay particular attention  to the following approach chart information: name and  number of the approach, localizer frequency, inbound course,  glideslope intercept altitude, DA/DH, missed approach  instructions, special notes/procedures, and the assigned  runway location and proximity to adjacent runways. Pilots  also need to exercise strict radio discipline, which includes  continuous monitoring of communications and the avoidance  of lengthy, unnecessary radio transmissions.  

# Side-Step Maneuver  

ATC may authorize a side-step maneuver to either one of  two parallel runways that are separated by 1,200 feet or less,  followed by a straight-in landing on the adjacent runway.  Aircraft executing a side-step maneuver are cleared for a  specified nonprecision approach and landing on the adjacent  parallel runway. For example, “Cleared ILS runway 7 left  approach, side-step to runway 7 right.” The pilot is expected  to commence the side-step maneuver as soon as possible  after the runway or runway environment is in sight. Landing  minimums to the adjacent runway are based on nonprecision  criteria and therefore higher than the precision minimums  to the primary runway, but are normally lower than the  published circling minimums.  

# Circling Approaches  

Landing minimums listed on the approach chart under  “CIRCLING” apply when it is necessary to circle the airport,  maneuver for landing, or when no straight-in minimums are  specified on the approach chart.  [Figure 10-11]  

The circling minimums published on the instrument approach  chart provide a minimum of 300 feet of obstacle clearance in  the circling area.  [Figure 10-12]  During a circling approach,  the pilot should maintain visual contact with the runway of  intended landing and fly no lower than the circling minimums  until positioned to make a final descent for a landing. It is  important to remember that circling minimums are only  minimums. If the ceiling allows it, fly at an altitude that more  nearly approximates VFR traffic pattern altitude. This makes  any maneuvering safer and brings the view of the landing  runway into a more normal perspective.  

![](images/e98a0c045b42cc09e73bfb1231a204383eddf6675fbcacd1d576e1bf23d1b9b3.jpg)  
Figure 10-12.   Circling approach area radii.  

Figure 10-13  shows patterns that can be used for circling  approaches. Pattern A can be flown when the final approach  course intersects the runway centerline at less than a   $90^{\circ}$  angle, and the runway is in sight early enough to establish a  base leg. If the runway becomes visible too late to fly pattern  A, circle as shown in B. Fly pattern C if it is desirable to land  opposite the direction of the final approach, and the runway  is sighted in time for a turn to downwind leg. If the runway  is sighted too late for a turn to downwind, fly pattern “D.”  Regardless of the pattern flown, the pilot must maneuver the  aircraft to remain within the designated circling area. Refer to  section A (“Terms and Landing Minima Data”) in the front  of each TPP for a description of circling approach categories. The criteria for determining the pattern to be flown are  based on personal flying capabilities and knowledge of the  

![](images/e814524216f99f647cc3eae576ae46fc07830633dd5ceb60d7dc6fc9ee2dfccd.jpg)

performance characteristics of the aircraft. In each instance,  the pilot must consider all factors: airport design, ceiling and  visibility, wind direction and velocity, final approach course  alignment, distance from the final approach fix to the runway,  and ATC instructions.  

# IAP Minimums  

Pilots may not operate an aircraft at any airport below  the authorized MDA or continue an approach below the  authorized DA/DH unless:  

1.	 The aircraft is continuously in a position from which  a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be  made at a normal descent rate using normal maneuvers; 2.	 The flight visibility is not less than that prescribed for  the approach procedure being used; and 3.	 At least one of the following visual references for the  intended runway is visible and identifiable to the pilot: a)	 Approach light system b)	 Threshold c)	 Threshold markings d)	 Threshold lights e)	 Runway end identifier lights (REIL) f)	 Visual approach slope indicator (VASI) g)	 Touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings h)	 Touchdown zone lights i)	 Runway or runway markings j)	 Runway lights  

remaining clear of obstacles. The procedure is shown on the  approach chart in text and graphic form. Since the execution  of a missed approach occurs when the flight deck workload is  at a maximum, the procedure should be studied and mastered  before beginning the approach.  

When a MAP is initiated, a climb pitch attitude should be  established while setting climb power. Configure the aircraft  for climb, turn to the appropriate heading, advise ATC that  a missed approach is being executed, and request further  clearances.  

If the missed approach is initiated prior to reaching the MAP,  unless otherwise cleared by ATC, continue to fly the IAP as  specified on the approach chart. Fly to the MAP at or above  the MDA or DA/DH before beginning a turn.  

If visual reference is lost while circling-to-land from an  instrument approach, execute the appropriate MAP. Make  the initial climbing turn toward the landing runway and then  maneuver to intercept and fly the missed approach course.  

Pilots should immediately execute the MAP:  

1.	 Whenever the requirements for operating below DA/ DH or MDA are not met when the aircraft is below  MDA, or upon arrival at the MAP and at any time  after that until touchdown; 2.	 Whenever an identifiable part of the airport is not  visible to the pilot during a circling maneuver at or  above MDA; or  3.	 When so directed by ATC.  

# Missed Approaches  

A MAP is formulated for each published instrument approach  and allows the pilot to return to the airway structure while  

# Landing  

According to 14 CFR part 91, no pilot may land when the  flight visibility is less than the visibility prescribed in the  standard IAP being used. ATC provides the pilot with the  current visibility reports appropriate to the runway in use.  This may be in the form of prevailing visibility, runway visual  value (RVV), or runway visual range (RVR). However, only  the pilot can determine if the flight visibility meets the landing  requirements indicated on the approach chart. If the flight  visibility meets the minimum prescribed for the approach,  then the approach may be continued to a landing. If the flight  visibility is less than that prescribed for the approach, then  the pilot must execute a missed approach regardless of the  reported visibility.  

The landing minimums published on IAP charts are based on  full operation of all components and visual aids associated  with the instrument approach chart being used. Higher  minimums are required with inoperative components or  visual aids. For example, if the ALSF-1 approach lighting  system were inoperative, the visibility minimums for an ILS  would need to be increased by one-quarter mile. If more  than one component is inoperative, each minimum is raised  to the highest minimum required by any single component  that is inoperative. ILS glideslope inoperative minimums  are published on instrument approach charts as localizer  minimums. Consult the “Inoperative Components or Visual  Aids Table” (printed on the inside front cover of each  TPP) for a complete description of the effect of inoperative  components on approach minimums.  

# Instrument Weather Flying  

# Flying Experience  

The more experience a pilot has in VFR and IFR flight,  the more proficient a pilot becomes. VFR experience can  be gained by flying in terminal areas with high traffic  activity. This type of flying forces the pilot to polish the  skill of dividing his or her attention between aircraft control,  navigation, communications, and other flight deck duties.  IFR experience can be gained through night flying which  also promotes both instrument proficiency and confidence.  The progression from flying at night under clear, moonlit  conditions to flying at night without moonlight, natural  horizon, or familiar landmarks teaches a pilot to trust the  aircraft instruments with minimal dependence upon what  can be seen outside the aircraft. It is a pilot’s decision to  proceed with an IFR flight or to wait for more acceptable  weather conditions.  

# Recency of Experience  

aircraft under IFR or in weather conditions less than VFR  minimums unless he or she has met the requirements of Part  91. Remember, these are minimum requirements.  

# Airborne Equipment and Ground Facilities  

Regulations specify minimum equipment for filing an IFR  flight plan. It is the pilot’s responsibility to determine the  adequacy of the aircraft and navigation/communication  (NAV/COM) equipment for the proposed IFR flight.  Performance limitations, accessories, and general condition  of the equipment are directly related to the weather, route,  altitude, and ground facilities pertinent to the flight, as well  as to the flight deck workload.  

# Weather Conditions  

In addition to the weather conditions that might affect a  VFR flight, an IFR pilot must consider the effects of other  weather phenomena (e.g., thunderstorms, turbulence, icing,  and visibility).  

# Turbulence  

Inflight turbulence can range from occasional light bumps to  extreme airspeed and altitude variations that make aircraft  control difficult. To reduce the risk factors associated with  turbulence, pilots must learn methods of avoidance, as well as  piloting techniques for dealing with an inadvertent encounter.  

Turbulence avoidance begins with a thorough preflight  weather briefing. Many reports and forecasts are available to  assist the pilot in determining areas of potential turbulence.  These include the Severe Weather Warning (WW), SIGMET  (WS), Convective SIGMET (WST), AIRMET (WA), Severe  Weather Outlook (AC), Center Weather Advisory (CWA),  Area Forecast (FA), and Pilot Reports (UA or PIREPs). Since  thunderstorms are always indicative of turbulence, areas  of known and forecast thunderstorm activity is always of  interest to the pilot. In addition, clear air turbulence (CAT)  associated with jet streams, strong winds over rough terrain,  and fast moving cold fronts are good indicators of turbulence.  

Pilots should be alert while in flight for the signposts of  turbulence. For example, clouds with vertical development  such as cumulus, towering cumulus, and cumulonimbus are  indicators of atmospheric instability and possible turbulence.  Standing lenticular clouds lack vertical development but  indicate strong mountain wave turbulence. While en route,  pilots can monitor hazardous inflight weather advisory  service (HIWAS) broadcast for updated weather advisories,  or contact the nearest FSS or En Route Flight Advisory  Service (EFAS) for the latest turbulence-related PIREPs.  

Currency as an instrument pilot is an equally important  consideration. No person may act as pilot in command of an  To avoid turbulence associated with strong thunderstorms,  circumnavigate cells by at least 20 miles. Turbulence may  also be present in the clear air above a thunderstorm. To  avoid this, fly at least 1,000 feet above the top for every 10  knots of wind at that level, or fly around the storm. Finally,  do not underestimate the turbulence beneath a thunderstorm.  Never attempt to fly under a thunderstorm. The possible  results of turbulence and wind shear under the storm could  be disastrous.  

When moderate to severe turbulence is encountered, aircraft  control is difficult, and a great deal of concentration is  required to maintain an instrument scan.  [Figure 10-14] Pilots should immediately reduce power and slow the  aircraft to the recommended turbulence penetration speed  as described in the POH/AFM. To minimize the load factor  imposed on the aircraft, the wings should be kept level and the  aircraft’s pitch attitude should be held constant. The aircraft  is allowed to fluctuate up and down because maneuvering  to maintain a constant altitude only increases the stress on  the aircraft. If necessary, the pilot should advise ATC of  the fluctuations and request a block altitude clearance. In  addition, the power should remain constant at a setting that  maintains the recommended turbulence penetration airspeed.  

The best source of information on the location and intensity  of turbulence are PIREPs. Therefore, pilots are encouraged to  familiarize themselves with the turbulence reporting criteria  found in the AIM, which also describes the procedure for  volunteering PIREPs relating to turbulence.  

# Structural Icing  

The very nature of flight in instrument meteorological  conditions (IMC) means operating in visible moisture such  as clouds. At the right temperatures, this moisture can  freeze on the aircraft, causing increased weight, degraded  performance, and unpredictable aerodynamic characteristics.  Understanding avoidance and early recognition followed  by prompt action are the keys to avoiding this potentially  hazardous situation.  

Structural icing refers to the accumulation of ice on the  exterior of the aircraft and is broken down into three  classifications: rime ice, clear ice, and mixed ice. For ice  to form, there must be moisture present in the air, and the  air must be cooled to a temperature of  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $32\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   or less.  Aerodynamic cooling can lower the surface temperature of  an airfoil and cause ice to form on the airframe even though  the ambient temperature is slightly above freezing.  

Rime ice forms if the droplets are small and freeze  immediately when contacting the aircraft surface. This type  of ice usually forms on areas such as the leading edges of  wings or struts. It has a somewhat rough-looking appearance  and a milky-white color.  

![](images/571d3f4d33ef747d71afc7489f97d792a7aa69a7547b2807efd9e2180e57f637.jpg)  
Figure 10-14 .  Maintaining an instrument scan in severe turbulence can be difficult.  

Clear ice is usually formed from larger water droplets or  freezing rain that can spread over a surface. This is the most  dangerous type of ice since it is clear, hard to see, and can  change the shape of the airfoil.  

Mixed ice is a mixture of clear ice and rime ice. It has the  bad characteristics of both types and can form rapidly. Ice  particles become embedded in clear ice, building a very  rough accumulation. The table in  Figure 10-15  lists the  temperatures at which the various types of ice form.  

![Figure 10-15 .  Temperature ranges for ice formation. ](images/dc76329ff25568e220949a38239baecc51effef644120910668619f1b8dcb989.jpg)  

Structural icing is a condition that can only get worse.  Therefore, during an inadvertent icing encounter, it is  important the pilot act to prevent additional ice accumulation.  Regardless of the level of anti-ice or deice protection offered  by the aircraft, the first course of action should be to leave  the area of visible moisture. This might mean descending  to an altitude below the cloud bases, climbing to an altitude  that is above the cloud tops, or turning to a different course.  If this is not possible, then the pilot must move to an altitude  where the temperature is above freezing. Pilots should report  icing conditions to ATC and request new routing or altitude  if icing will be a hazard. Refer to the AIM for information  on reporting icing intensities.  

# Fog  

Instrument pilots must learn to anticipate conditions leading  to the formation of fog and take appropriate action early in  the progress of the flight. Before a flight, close examination  of current and forecast weather should alert the pilot to the  possibility of fog formation. When fog is a consideration,  pilots should plan adequate fuel reserves and alternate landing  sites. En route, the pilot must stay alert for fog formation  through weather updates from EFAS, ATIS, and ASOS/ AWOS sites.  

Two conditions lead to the formation of fog. Either the air  is cooled to saturation, or sufficient moisture is added to the  air until saturation occurs. In either case, fog can form when  the temperature/dewpoint spread is  $5^{\circ}$   or less. Pilots planning  to arrive at their destination near dusk with decreasing  temperatures should be particularly concerned about the  possibility of fog formation.  

# Volcanic Ash  

Volcanic eruptions create volcanic ash clouds containing  an abrasive dust that poses a serious safety threat to flight  operations. Adding to the danger is the fact that these ash  clouds are not easily discernible from ordinary clouds when  encountered at some distance from the volcanic eruption.  

When an aircraft enters a volcanic ash cloud, dust particles  and smoke may become evident in the cabin, often along with  the odor of an electrical fire. Inside the volcanic ash cloud,  the aircraft may also experience lightning and St. Elmo’s fire  on the windscreen. The abrasive nature of the volcanic ash  can pit the windscreens, thus reducing or eliminating forward  visibility. The pitot-static system may become clogged,  causing instrument failure. Severe engine damage is probable  in both piston and jet-powered aircraft.  

Every effort must be made to avoid volcanic ash. Since  volcanic ash clouds are carried by the wind, pilots should plan  their flights to remain upwind of the ash-producing volcano.  Visual detection and airborne radar are not considered  a reliable means of avoiding volcanic ash clouds. Pilots  witnessing volcanic eruptions or encountering volcanic ash  should immediately pass this information along in the form of  a pilot report. The National Weather Service (NWS) monitors  volcanic eruptions and estimates ash trajectories. This  information is passed along to pilots in the form of SIGMETs.  

As for many other hazards to flight, the best source of  volcanic information comes from PIREPs. Pilots who  witness a volcanic eruption or encounter volcanic ash in flight  should immediately inform the nearest agency. Volcanic  Ash Forecast Transport and Dispersion (VAFTAD) charts  are also available; these depict volcanic ash cloud locations  in the atmosphere following an eruption and also forecast  dispersion of the ash concentrations over 6- and 12-hour  time intervals. See AC 00-45, Aviation Weather Services.  

# Thunderstorms  

A thunderstorm packs just about every weather hazard known  to aviation into one vicious bundle. Turbulence, hail, rain,  snow, lightning, sustained updrafts and downdrafts, and  icing conditions are all present in thunderstorms. Do not  take off in the face of an approaching thunderstorm or fly an  aircraft that is not equipped with thunderstorm detection in  clouds or at night in areas of suspected thunderstorm activity.  [Figure 10-16]  

There is no useful correlation between the external visual  appearance of thunderstorms and the severity or amount of  turbulence or hail within them. All thunderstorms should be  considered hazardous, and thunderstorms with tops above  35,000 feet should be considered extremely hazardous.

Figure 10-16.   A thunderstorm packs just about every weather hazard  known to aviation into one vicious bundle.  

Weather radar, airborne or ground based, normally reflects  the areas of moderate to heavy precipitation (radar does not  detect turbulence). The frequency and severity of turbulence  generally increases with the radar reflectivity closely  associated with the areas of highest liquid water content of  the storm. A flightpath through an area of strong or very  strong radar echoes separated by 20 to 30 miles or less may  not be considered free of severe turbulence.  

The probability of lightning strikes occurring to aircraft is  greatest when operating at altitudes where temperatures are  between  $-5\,^{\circ}\,\mathbf{C}$   and  $+5\,^{\circ}\,\mathrm{C}.$  . In addition, an aircraft flying in the  clear air near a thunderstorm is also susceptible to lightning  strikes. Thunderstorm avoidance is always the best policy.  

# Wind Shear  

Wind shear can be defined as a change in wind speed and/or  wind direction in a short distance. It can exist in a horizontal  or vertical direction and occasionally in both. Wind shear can  occur at all levels of the atmosphere but is of greatest concern  during takeoffs and landings. It is typically associated  with thunderstorms and low-level temperature inversions;  however, the jet stream and weather fronts are also sources  of wind shear.  

As  Figure 10-17  illustrates, while an aircraft is on an  instrument approach, a shear from a tailwind to a headwind  causes the airspeed to increase and the nose to pitch up with  a corresponding balloon above the glidepath. A shear from  a headwind to a tailwind has the opposite effect, and the  aircraft will sink below the glidepath.  

A headwind shear followed by a tailwind/downdraft shear is  particularly dangerous because the pilot has reduced power  and lowered the nose in response to the headwind shear. This  leaves the aircraft in a nose-low, power-low configuration  when the tailwind shear occurs, which makes recovery more  difficult, particularly near the ground. This type of wind  shear scenario is likely while making an approach in the  face of an oncoming thunderstorm. Pilots should be alert for  indications of wind shear early in the approach phase and be  ready to initiate a missed approach at the first indication. It  may be impossible to recover from a wind shear encounter  at low altitude.  

To inform pilots of hazardous wind shear activity, some  airports have installed a Low-Level Wind Shear Alert  System (LLWAS) consisting of a centerfield wind indicator  and several surrounding boundary-wind indicators. With  

![](images/270e44ea4650c1109fa0a5020cb3c2adbff7cfb00eaf3cb36ecea039943bad1d.jpg)  
Figure 10-17.   Glideslope deviations due to wind shear encounter.  

this system, controllers are alerted of wind discrepancies  (an indicator of wind shear possibility) and provide this  information to pilots. A typical wind shear alert issued to a  pilot would be:  

“Runway 27 arrival, wind shear alert, 20 knot loss 3  mile final, threshold wind 200 at 15”  

In plain language, the controller is advising aircraft arriving  on runway 27 that at about 3 miles out they can expect a  wind shear condition that will decrease their airspeed by 20  knots and possibly encounter turbulence. Additionally, the  airport surface winds for landing runway 27 are reported as   $200^{\circ}$   at 15 knots.  

Pilots encountering wind shear are encouraged to pass along  pilot reports. Refer to AIM for additional information on  wind shear PIREPs.  

# VFR-On-Top  

Pilots on IFR flight plans operating in VFR weather  conditions may request VFR-on-top in lieu of an assigned  altitude. This permits them to select an altitude or flight level  of their choice (subject to any ATC restrictions).  

Pilots desiring to climb through a cloud, haze, smoke, or  other meteorological formation and then either cancel their  IFR flight plan or operate VFR-on-top may request a climb  to VFR-on-top. The ATC authorization contains a top report  (or a statement that no top report is available) and a request  to report upon reaching VFR-on-top. Additionally, the ATC  authorization may contain a clearance limit, routing, and  an alternative clearance if VFR-on-top is not reached by a  specified altitude.  

A pilot on an IFR flight plan, operating in VFR conditions,  may request to climb/descend in VFR conditions. When  operating in VFR conditions with an ATC authorization to  “maintain VFR-on-top/maintain VFR conditions,” pilots on  IFR flight plans must:  

1.	 Fly at the appropriate VFR altitude as prescribed in  14 CFR part 91. 2.	 Comply with the VFR visibility and distance-from- cloud criteria in 14 CFR part 91. 3.	 Comply with IFR applicable to this flight (minimum IFR  altitudes, position reporting, radio communications,  course to be flown, adherence to ATC clearance, etc.).  

Pilots operating on a VFR-on-top clearance should advise  ATC before any altitude change to ensure the exchange of  accurate traffic information.  

ATC authorization to “maintain VFR-on-top” is not intended  to restrict pilots to operating only above an obscuring  meteorological formation (layer). Rather, it permits operation  above, below, between layers, or in areas where there is no  meteorological obstruction. It is imperative pilots understand,  however, that clearance to operate “VFR-on-top/VFR  conditions” does not imply cancellation of the IFR flight plan.  

Pilots operating VFR-on-top/VFR conditions may receive  traffic information from ATC on other pertinent IFR or  VFR aircraft. However, when operating in VFR weather  conditions, it is the pilot’s responsibility to be vigilant to see  and avoid other aircraft.  

This clearance must be requested by the pilot on an IFR flight  plan. VFR-on-top is not permitted in certain areas, such as  Class A airspace. Consequently, IFR flights operating VFR- on-top must avoid such airspace.  

# VFR Over-The-Top  

VFR over-the-top must not be confused with VFR-on- top. VFR-on-top is an IFR clearance that allows the pilot  to fly VFR altitudes. VFR over-the-top is strictly a VFR  operation in which the pilot maintains VFR cloud clearance  requirements while operating on top of an undercast layer.  This situation might occur when the departure airport and the  destination airport are reporting clear conditions, but a low  overcast layer is present in between. The pilot could conduct  a VFR departure, fly over the top of the undercast in VFR  conditions, then complete a VFR descent and landing at the  destination. VFR cloud clearance requirements would be  maintained at all times, and an IFR clearance would not be  required for any part of the flight.  

# Conducting an IFR Flight  

To illustrate some of the concepts introduced in this chapter,  follow along on a typical IFR flight from the Birmingham  International Airport (BHM), Birmingham, Alabama to  Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport (GPT), Gulfport,  Mississippi.  [Figure 10-18]  For this trip, a Cessna 182 with  a call sign of N1230A is flown. The aircraft is equipped with  dual navigation and communication radios, a transponder,  and a GPS system approved for IFR en route, terminal, and  approach operations.  

# Preflight  

The success of the flight depends largely upon the  thoroughness of the preflight planning. The evening before  the flight, pay close attention to the weather forecast and  begin planning the flight.  

![](images/922cc155ff960de0e9f9ef6acaaba0dba3b45a63a35052cbde88ba22373431ba.jpg)  

The Weather Channel indicates a large, low-pressure system  has settled in over the Midwest, pulling moisture up from  the Gulf of Mexico and causing low ceilings and visibility  with little chance for improvement over the next couple of  days. To begin planning, gather all the necessary charts and  materials, and verify everything is current. This includes en  route charts, approach charts, DPs, STAR charts, the GPS  database, as well as an A/FD, some navigation logs, and the  aircraft’s POH/AFM. The charts cover both the departure  and arrival airports and any contingency airports that will  be needed if the flight cannot be completed as planned. This  is also a good time for the pilot to consider recent flight  experience, pilot proficiency, fitness, and personal weather  minimums to fly this particular flight.  

Check the A/FD to become familiar with the departure and  arrival airport, and check for any preferred routing between  BHM and GPT. Next, review the approach charts and any  DP or STAR that pertains to the flight. Finally, review the  en route charts for potential routing, paying close attention  to the minimum en route and obstacle clearance altitudes.  

After this review, select the best option. For this flight, the  Birmingham Three Departure  [Figure 10-2]  to Brookwood  VORTAC, V 209 to Kewanee VORTAC, direct to Gulfport  using GPS would be a logical route. An altitude of 4,000 feet  meets all the regulatory requirements and falls well within  the performance capabilities of the aircraft.  

Next, call 1-800-WX-BRIEF to obtain an outlook-type  weather briefing for the proposed flight. This provides  forecast conditions for departure and arrival airports, as well  as the en route portion of the flight including forecast winds  aloft. This also is a good opportunity to check the available  NOTAMs.  

The weather briefer confirms the predictions of the Weather  Channel giving forecast conditions that are at or near  minimum landing minimums at both BHM and GPT for  the proposed departure time. The briefer provides NOTAM  information for GPT indicating that the localizer to runway  32 is scheduled to be out of service and that runway 18/36 is  closed until further notice. Also check for temporary flight  restrictions (TFRs) along the proposed route.  

After receiving a weather briefing, continue flight planning  and begin to transfer some preliminary information onto  the navigation log, listing each fix along the route and the  distances, frequencies, and altitudes. Consolidating this  information onto an organized navigation log keeps the  workload to a minimum during the flight.  

Next, obtain a standard weather briefing online for the  proposed route. A check of current conditions indicates  low IFR conditions at both the departure airport and the  destination, with visibility of one-quarter mile:  

SURFACE WEATHER OBSERVATIONS METAR KBHM 111155Z VRB04KT ¼ SM FG –RA VV004  06/05 A2994 RMK A02 SLP140  

METAR KGPT 111156Z 24003KT ¼ SM FG OVC001 08/07  A2962 RMK A02 SLP033  

The small temperature/dewpoint spread is causing the low  visibility and ceilings. Conditions should improve later in  the day as temperatures increase. A check of the terminal  forecast confirms this theory:

In addition to the terminal forecast, the area forecast also  indicates gradual improvement along the route. Since the  terminal forecast only provides information for a 5-mile  radius around a terminal area, checking the area forecast  provides a better understanding of the overall weather picture  along the route, as well as potential hazards:

At this time, there are no SIGMETs or PIREPs reported.  However, there are several AIRMETs, one for IFR  conditions, one for turbulence that covers the entire route,  and another for icing conditions that covers an area just north  of the route:

A recheck of NOTAMs for Gulfport confirms that the  localizer to runway 32 is out of service until further notice  and runway 18/36 is closed. If runway 6 is planned for the  departure, confirm that the climb restriction for the departure  can be met.

If weather minimums are below a pilot’s personal minimums,  a delay in departure to wait for improved conditions is  a good decision. This time can be used to complete the  navigation log, which is the next step in planning an IFR  flight.  [Figure 10-19]  

Use the POH/AFM to compute a true airspeed, cruise power  setting, and fuel burn based on the forecast temperatures  aloft and cruising pressure altitude. Also, compute weight- and-balance information and determine takeoff and landing  distances. There will be a crosswind if weather conditions  require a straight-in landing on runway 14 at GPT. Therefore,  compute the landing distance assuming a 10-knot crosswind  and determine if the runway length is adequate to allow  landing. Determine the estimated flight time and fuel burn  using the winds aloft forecast and considering Pensacola  Regional Airport as an alternate airport. With full tanks, the  flight can be made nonstop with adequate fuel for flight to  the destination, alternate, and the reserve requirement.  

Next, check the surface analysis chart, which shows where  the pressure systems are found. The weather depiction chart  shows areas of IFR conditions and can be used to find areas  of improving conditions. These charts provide information a  pilot needs should a diversion to VFR conditions be required.  For this flight, the radar depicts precipitation along the route,  and the latest satellite photo confirms what the weather  depiction chart showed.  

When the navigation log is finished, complete the flight plan  in preparation for filing with flight service.  [Figure 10-20]  

Call an FSS for an updated weather briefing. Birmingham  INTL airport is now reporting 700 overcast with 3 miles  visibility, and Gulfport-Biloxi is now 400 overcast with 2  miles visibility. The alternate, Pensacola Regional Airport,  continues to report adequate weather conditions with 2,000  overcast and 3 miles visibility in light rain.  

Several pilot reports have been submitted for light icing  conditions; however, all the reports are north of the route  of flight and correspond to the AIRMET that was issued  earlier. No pilot reports have included cloud tops, but the  area forecast predicted cloud tops to flight level 240. Since  the weather conditions appear to be improving, a flight plan  can be filed using the completed form.  

Analyze the latest weather minimums to determine if they  exceed personal minimums. With the absence of icing  reported along the route and steadily rising temperatures,  

![](images/f17b3fc829287ce417808e51de1ee62bcca0b6d6102a797020333cd8dc350083.jpg)  

structural icing should not be a problem. Make a note to do an  operational check of the pitot heat during preflight and to take  evasive action immediately should even light icing conditions  be encountered in flight. This may require returning to BHM  or landing at an intermediate spot before reaching GPT. The  go/no-go decision is constantly reevaluated during the flight.  

Once at the airport, conduct a thorough preflight inspection.  A quick check of the logbooks indicates all airworthiness  requirements have been met to conduct this IFR flight  including an altimeter, static, and transponder test within  the preceding 24 calendar months. In addition, a log on  the clipboard indicates the VOR system has been checked  

![](images/602ec283b74c4584ee95f3c06703b5eaba0be06a1e5a546a13ffacafc4bf3fc9.jpg)

within the preceding 30 days. Turn on the master switch and  pitot heat, and quickly check the heating element before it  becomes too hot. Then, complete the rest of the walk-around  procedure. Since this is a flight in actual IFR conditions, place  special emphasis on IFR equipment during the walk-around,  including the alternator belt and antennas. After completing  the preflight, organize charts, pencils, paper, and navigation  log in the flight deck for quick, easy access. This is also the  time to enter the planned flight into the GPS.  

# Departure  

After starting the engine, tune in ATIS and copy the  information to the navigation log. The conditions remain the  same as the updated weather briefing with the ceiling at 700  overcast and visibility at 3 miles. Call clearance delivery to  receive a clearance:  

“Clearance Delivery, Cessna 1230A IFR to Gulfport  Biloxi with information Kilo, ready to copy.”  

“Cessna 1230A is cleared to Gulfport-Biloxi via the  Birmingham Three Departure, Brookwood, Victor  209 Kewanee then direct Mindo, Gulfport. Climb and  maintain 4,000. Squawk 0321.”  

Read back the clearance and review the DP. Although a  departure frequency was not given in the clearance, note that  on the DP, the departure control frequency is listed as 123.8  for the southern sector. Since a departure from runway 24  is anticipated, note the instruction to climb to 2,100 prior  to turning. After tuning in the appropriate frequencies and  setting up navigation equipment for the departure routing,  contact ground control (noting that this is IFR) and receive  the following clearance:  

“Cessna 1230A taxi to runway 24 via taxiway Mike.”  

Read back the clearance and aircraft call sign. After a review  of the taxi instructions on the airport diagram, begin to taxi  and check the flight instruments for proper indications.  

Hold short of runway 24 and complete the before takeoff  checklist and engine run-up. Advise the tower when ready  for takeoff. The tower gives the following clearance:  

“Cessna 30A cleared for takeoff runway 24.  Caution wake turbulence from 737 departing to the  northwest.”  

Taxi into position. Note the time off on the navigation log,  verify that the heading indicator and magnetic compass are  in agreement, the transponder is in the ALT position, all the  necessary lights, equipment, and pitot heat are on. Start the  takeoff roll. To avoid the 737’s wake turbulence, make note  of its lift off point and take off prior to that point.  

# En Route  

After departure, climb straight ahead to 2,100 feet as directed  by the Birmingham Three Departure. While continuing a  climb to the assigned altitude of 4,000 feet, the following  instructions are received from the tower:  

“Cessna 30A contact Departure.”  

Acknowledge the clearance and contact departure on the  frequency designated by the DP. State the present altitude  so the departure controller can check the encoded altitude  against indicated altitude:  

“Birmingham Departure Cessna 1230A climbing  through 2,700 heading 240.”  

Departure replies:  

“Cessna 30A proceed direct to Brookwood and resume  own navigation. Contact Atlanta Center on 134.05.”  

Acknowledge the clearance, contact Atlanta Center and  proceed direct to Brookwood VORTAC, using the IFR- approved GPS equipment. En route to Kewanee, VORTAC  Atlanta Center issues the following instructions:  

“Cessna 1230A contact Memphis Center on  125.975.”  

Acknowledge the instructions and contact Memphis Center  with aircraft ID and present altitude. Memphis Center  acknowledges contact:  

“Cessna 1230A, Meridian altimeter is 29.87. Traffic  at your 2 o’clock and 6 miles is a King Air at 5,000  climbing to 12,000.”  

Even when on an IFR flight plan, pilots are still responsible  for seeing and avoiding other aircraft. Acknowledge the call  from Memphis Center and inform them of negative contact  with traffic due to IMC.  

“Roger, altimeter setting 29.87. Cessna 1230A is in  IMC negative contact with traffic.”  

Continue the flight, and at each fix note the arrival time on  the navigation log to monitor progress.  

To get an update of the weather at the destination and issue  a pilot report, contact the FSS servicing the area. To find the  nearest FSS, locate a nearby VOR and check above the VOR  information box for a frequency. In this case, the nearest VOR  is Kewanee VORTAC which lists a receive-only frequency  of 122.1 for Greenwood FSS. Request a frequency change  from Memphis and then attempt to contact Greenwood on  122.1 while listening over the Kewanee VORTAC frequency  of 113.8:  

“Greenwood Radio Cessna 1230A receiving on  frequency 113.8, over.”  

“Cessna 30A, this is Greenwood, go ahead.”  

“Greenwood Radio, Cessna 30A is currently 30 miles  south of the Kewanee VORTAC at 4,000 feet en  route to Gulfport. Requesting an update of en route  conditions and current weather at GPT, as well as  PNS.”  

“Cessna 30A, Greenwood Radio, current weather at  Gulfport is 400 overcast with 3 miles visibility in light  rain. The winds are from 140 at 7 and the altimeter  is 29.86. Weather across your route is generally IFR  in light rain with ceilings ranging from 300 to 1,000  overcast with visibilities between 1 and 3 miles.  Pensacola weather is much better with ceilings now  at 2,500 and visibility 6 miles. Checking current  NOTAMs at GPT shows the localizer out of service  and runway 18/36 closed.”  

“Roger, Cessna 30A copies the weather. I have a  PIREP when you are ready to copy.”  

“Cessna 30A go ahead with your PIREP.”  

“Cessna 30A is a Cessna 182 located on the Kewanee   $195^{\circ}$   radial at 30 miles level at 4,000 feet. I am  currently in IMC conditions with a smooth ride.  Outside air temperature is plus   $1^{\circ}$   Celsius. Negative  icing.”  

“Cessna 30A thank you for the PIREP.”  

With the weather check and PIREP complete, return to  Memphis Center:  

“Memphis Center, Cessna 1230A is back on your  frequency.”  

“Cessna 1230A, Memphis Center, roger, contact  Houston Center now on frequency 126.8.”  

“Roger, contact Houston Center frequency 126.8,  Cessna 1230A.”  

“Houston Center, Cessna 1230A level at 4,000  feet.”  

“Cessna 30A, Houston Center area altimeter 29.88.”  

# Arrival  

40 miles north of Gulfport, tune in ATIS on number two  communication radio. The report reveals there has been no  change in the weather and ATIS is advertising ILS runway  14 as the active approach.  

Houston Center completes a hand off to Gulfport approach  control with instructions to contact approach:  

“Gulfport Approach, Cessna 1230A level 4,000 feet  with information TANGO. Request GPS Runway 14  approach.”  

“Cessna 30A Gulfport Tower, the ceiling is now 600  overcast and the visibility is 4 miles.”  

“Cleared to land runway 14, Cessna 30A.”  

Continue the approach, complete the appropriate checklists,  cross AVYUM, and begin the final descent. At 700 feet MSL  visual contact with the airport is possible. Slow the aircraft  and configure it to allow a normal descent to landing. As  touch down is completed, Gulfport Tower gives further  instructions:  

“Cessna 30A turn left at taxiway Bravo and contact  ground on 120.4.”  

“Roger, Cessna 30A.”  

Taxi clear of the runway and complete the appropriate  checklists. The tower automatically cancels the IFR flight  plan.  

“Cessna 30A, Gulfport Approach, descend and  maintain 3,000 feet.”  

“Descend to 3,000, Cessna 30A.”  

Begin a descent to 3,000 and configure your navigation radios  for the approach. The GPS automatically changes from the  en route mode to the terminal mode. This change affects the  sensitivity of the CDI. Tune in the VORTAC frequency of  109.0 on the number one navigation radio and set in the final  approach course of   $133^{\circ}$   on the OBS. This setup helps with  situational awareness should the GPS lose signal.  

“Cessna 30A your position is 7 miles from MINDO,  maintain 3,000 feet until MINDO, cleared for the GPS  runway 14 approach.”  

Read back the clearance and concentrate on flying the aircraft.  At MINDO descend to 2,000 as depicted on the approach  chart. At BROWA turn to the final approach course of   $133^{\circ}$  . Just outside the Final Approach Way Point (FAWP)  AVYUM, the GPS changes to the approach mode and the  CDI becomes even more sensitive. Gulfport approach control  issues instructions to contact Gulfport tower:  

“Cessna 30A contact Tower on 123.7.”  

“123.7, Cessna 30A.”  

“Tower, Cessna 1230A outside AVYUM on the GPS  runway 14.”  

# Chapter 11 Emergency  Operations  

# Introduction  

Changing weather conditions, air traffic control (ATC), the  aircraft, and the pilot are all variables that make instrument  flying an unpredictable and challenging operation. The safety  of the flight depends upon the pilot’s ability to manage these  variables while maintaining positive aircraft control and  adequate situational awareness. This chapter discusses the  recognition and suggested remedies for such abnormal and  emergency events related to unforecasted, adverse weather;  aircraft system malfunctions; communication/navigation  system malfunctions; and loss of situational awareness.  

# Unforecast Adverse Weather  

# Inadvertent Thunderstorm Encounter  

A pilot should avoid flying through a thunderstorm of any  intensity. However, certain conditions may be present  that could lead to an inadvertent thunderstorm encounter.  For example, flying in areas where thunderstorms are  embedded in large cloud masses may make thunderstorm  avoidance difficult, even when the aircraft is equipped  with thunderstorm detection equipment. Therefore, pilots  must be prepared to deal with an inadvertent thunderstorm  penetration. At the very least, a thunderstorm encounter  subjects the aircraft to turbulence that could be severe. The  pilot and passengers should tighten seat belts and shoulder  harnesses, and secure any loose items in the cabin.  

As with any emergency, the first order of business during  an inadvertent thunderstorm encounter must be to fly the  aircraft. The pilot workload is heavy; therefore, increased  concentration is necessary to maintain an instrument scan.  If a pilot inadvertently enters a thunderstorm, it is better to  maintain a course straight through the thunderstorm rather  than turning around. A straight course minimizes the amount  of time in the thunderstorm, and turning maneuvers only  increase structural stress on the aircraft.  

Reduce power to a setting that maintains a speed at the  recommended turbulence penetration speed as described in the  Pilot’s Operating Handbook/Airplane Flight Manual (POH/ AFM), and try to minimize additional power adjustments.  Concentrate on maintaining a level attitude while allowing  airspeed and altitude to fluctuate. Similarly, if using the  autopilot, disengage the altitude hold and speed hold modes,  as they only increase the aircraft’s maneuvering—thereby  increasing structural stress.  

During a thunderstorm encounter, the potential for icing  also exists. As soon as possible, turn on anti-icing/deicing  equipment and carburetor heat, if equipped. Icing can be  rapid at any altitude and may lead to power failure and/or  loss of airspeed indication.  

Lightning is also present in a thunderstorm and can  temporarily blind a pilot. To reduce this risk, turn up flight  deck lights to the highest intensity, concentrate on the flight  instruments, and resist the urge to look outside.  

# Inadvertent Icing Encounter  

Because icing is unpredictable in nature, pilots may find  themselves in icing conditions even though they have done  everything practicable to avoid it. In order to stay alert to this  possibility while operating in visible moisture, pilots should  monitor the outside air temperature (OAT).  

The effects of ice on aircraft are cumulative—thrust is  reduced, drag increases, lift lessens, and weight increases.  The results are an increase in stall speed and a deterioration  of aircraft performance. In extreme cases, two to three inches  of ice can form on the leading edge of the airfoil in less than 5  minutes. It takes only  $\%$   inch of ice to reduce the lifting power  of some aircraft by 50 percent and increases the frictional  drag by an equal percentage.  

A pilot can expect icing when flying in visible precipitation,  such as rain or cloud droplets, and the temperature is  between   $+02$   and   $-10^{\circ}$   Celsius. When icing is detected, a  pilot should do one of two things, particularly if the aircraft  is not equipped with deicing equipment: leave the area of  precipitation or go to an altitude where the temperature is  above freezing. This “warmer” altitude may not always be  a lower altitude. Proper preflight action includes obtaining  information on the freezing level and the above-freezing  levels in precipitation areas.  

If neither option is available, consider an immediate landing  at the nearest suitable airport. Even if the aircraft is equipped  with anti-icing/deicing equipment, it is not designed to allow  aircraft to operate indefinitely in icing conditions. Anti- icing/deicing equipment gives a pilot more time to get out of  the icing conditions. Report icing to ATC and request new  routing or altitude. Be sure to report the type of aircraft, and  use the following terms when reporting icing to ATC:  

1.	 Trace. Ice becomes perceptible. Rate of accumulation  is slightly greater than sublimation. Anti-icing/deicing  equipment is not utilized unless encountered for an  extended period of time (over 1 hour). 2.	 Light. The rate of accumulation may create a problem  if flight is prolonged in this environment (over 1  hour). Occasional use of anti-icing/deicing  equipment  removes/prevents accumulation. It does not present a  problem if anti-icing/deicing equipment is used. 3.	 Moderate. The rate of accumulation is such that even  short encounters become potentially hazardous and  use of anti-icing/deicing equipment or flight diversion  is necessary. 4.	 Severe. The rate of accumulation is such that anti- icing/deicing equipment fails to reduce or control the  hazard. Immediate flight diversion is necessary.  

Early ice detection is critical and is particularly difficult during  night flight. Use a flashlight to check for ice accumulation on  the wings. At the first indication of ice accumulation, take  action to get out of the icing conditions. Refer to the POH/ AFM for the proper use of anti-icing/deicing equipment.  

# Precipitation Static  

Precipitation static, often referred to as P-static, occurs  when accumulated static electricity is discharged from the  extremities of the aircraft. This discharge has the potential  to create problems for the instrument pilot. These problems  range from the serious, such as erroneous magnetic compass  readings and the complete loss of very high frequency (VHF)  communications to the annoyance of high-pitched audio  squealing and St. Elmo’s fire.  [Figure 11-1]  

Precipitation static is caused when an aircraft encounters  airborne particles during flight (e.g., rain or snow) and  develops a negative charge. It can also result from  atmospheric electric fields in thunderstorm clouds. When  a significant negative voltage level is reached, the aircraft  discharges it, which can create electrical disturbances. This  electrical discharge builds with time as the aircraft flies in  precipitation. It is usually encountered in rain, but snow can  cause the same effect. As the static buildup increases, the  effectiveness of both communication and navigation systems  decreases to the point of potential unusability.  

To reduce the problems associated with P-static, the pilot  should ensure the aircraft’s static wicks are properly maintained  and accounted for. Broken or missing static wicks should be  replaced before an instrument flight.  [Figure 11-2]  

# Aircraft System Malfunctions  

Preventing aircraft system malfunctions that might lead  to an inflight emergency begins with a thorough preflight  

![](images/6f1178b1439308b9b30ccd6b70b0599d875c86e243d9f2ade71ec4443a1e2a2d.jpg)  
Figure 11-2. Figure 11-2.   One example of a static wick installed on aircraft  control surface to bleed off static charges built up during flight.  This prevents static buildup and St. Elmo’s fire   by allowing the  static electricity to dissipate harmlessly.  

![](images/e65f72796f38bab607467fcf65a04488bf689a2d6cbd79e9badfb15a829136c4.jpg)

inspection. In addition to those items normally checked  prior to a visual flight rules (VFR) flight, pilots intending to  fly under instrument flight rules (IFR) should pay particular  attention to the alternator belt, antennas, static wicks, anti- icing/deicing equipment, pitot tube, and static ports.  

During taxi, verify the operation and accuracy of all flight  instruments. In addition, during the run-up, verify that the  operation of the pneumatic system(s) is within acceptable  parameters. It is critical that all systems are determined to be  operational before departing into IFR conditions.  

# Electronic Flight Display Malfunction  

When a pilot becomes familiar and comfortable with the  new electronic displays, he or she also tends to become more  reliant on the system. The system then becomes a primary  source of navigation and data acquisition instead of the  supplementary source of data as initially intended.  

Complete reliance on the moving map for navigation becomes  a problem during a failure of one, more, or all of the flight  display screens. Under these conditions, the systems revert to  a composite mode (called reversionary), which eliminates the  moving map display and combines the primary flight display  (PFD) with the engine indicating system.  [Figure 11-3]  If a  pilot has relied on the display for navigation information and  situational awareness, he or she lacks any concept of critical  data such as the aircraft’s position, the nearest airport, or  proximity to other aircraft.  

The electronic flight display (EFD) is a supplementary source  of navigation data and does not replace en route charts.  To maintain situational awareness, a pilot must follow the  flight on the en route chart while monitoring the PFD. It is  important for the pilot to know the location of the closest  airport as well as surrounding traffic relative to the location  of his or her aircraft. This information becomes critical  should the EFD fail.  

For the pilot who utilizes the electronic database as a  substitute for the Airport/Facilities Directory (A/FD), screen  failure or loss of electrical power can mean the pilot is no  longer able to access airport information. Once the pilot  loses the ability to call up airport information, aeronautical  decision-making (ADM) is compromised.  

![](images/01dc6f82888ca6d42cb4597330fc0328ca1c861764467c1bde73664f45839f99.jpg)  
Figure 11-3.   G1000 PFD display in normal mode and in the reversionary mode activated upon system failure.  

# Alternator/Generator Failure  

Depending upon the aircraft being flown, an alternator failure  is indicated in different ways. Some aircraft use an ammeter  that indicates the state of charge or discharge of the battery.  [Figure 11-4]  A positive indication on the ammeter indicates  a charge condition; a negative indication reveals a discharge  condition. Other aircraft use a loadmeter to indicate the load  being carried by the alternator.  [Figure 11-4]  

Sometimes an indicator light is also installed in the aircraft to  alert the pilot to an alternator failure. On some aircraft, such  as the Cessna 172, the light is located on the lower left side  making it difficult to see its illumination if charts are open.  Ensure that these safety indicators are visible during flight.  

When a loss of the electrical charging system is experienced,  the pilot has approximately 40 minutes of battery life  remaining before the system fails entirely. The time  mentioned is an approximation and should not be relied upon  as specific to all aircraft. In addition, the battery charge that  exists in a battery may not be full, altering the time available  before electrical exhaustion occurs. At no time should a pilot  consider continuing a flight once the electrical charging  system has failed. Land at the nearest suitable airport.  

# Techniques for Electrical Usage Master Battery Switch  

One technique for conserving the main battery charge is  to fly the aircraft to the airport of intended landing while  operating with minimal power. If a two-position battery  master/alternator rocker switch is installed, it can be utilized  to isolate the main battery from the electrical system and  conserve power.  [Figure 11-5]  

![](images/ccc76ea8643d7e693454fe15c30a263e25ec1d9af5a44e0884e43fe963ea0c25.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.  Double rocker switch seen on many aircraft.  

# Operating on the Main Battery  

While en route to the airport of intended landing, reduce the  electrical load as much as practical. Turn off all unnecessary  electrical items, such as duplicate radios, non-essential  lighting, etc. If unable to turn off radios, lights, etc., manually,  consider pulling circuit breakers to isolate those pieces of  equipment from the electrical system. Maximum time of  useful voltage may be between 30 and 40 minutes and is  influenced by many factors, that degrade the useful time.  

# Loss of Alternator/Generator for Electronic Flight  Instrumentation  

With the increase in electrical components being installed  in modern technically advanced aircraft, the power supply  and the charging system need increased attention and  

![](images/a6bb67f3d9eb55a6560f8be50c88fbf4eb98146a8bb2606cd0d0d0f0deebf22e.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.   Ammeter (left) and loadmeter (right).  

understanding. Traditional round dial aircraft do not rely  as heavily on electrical power for the primary six-pack  instrumentation. Modern EFDs utilize the electrical system  to power the Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS),  air data computer (ADC), engine indicating system (EIS),  etc. A loss of an alternator or generator was considered an  abnormality in traditionally-equipped aircraft; however,  a failure of this magnitude is considered an emergency in  technically advanced aircraft.  

Due to the increased demand for electrical power, it is  necessary for manufacturers to install a standby battery in  conjunction with the primary battery. The standby battery is  held in reserve and kept charged in case of a failure of the  charging system and a subsequent exhaustion of the main  battery. The standby battery is brought online when the main  battery voltage is depleted to a specific value, approximately  19 volts. Generally, the standby battery switch must be in  the ARM position for this to occur but pilots should refer to  the aircraft flight manual (AFM) for specifics on an aircraft’s  electrical system. The standby battery powers the essential  bus and allows the PFD to be utilized.  

The essential bus usually powers the following components:  

1.	 AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) 2.	 ADC (Air Data Computer) 3.	 PFD (Primary Flight Display) 4.	 Navigation Radio #1 5.	 Communication Radio #1 6.	 Standby Indicator Light  

# Techniques for Electrical Usage Standby Battery  

One technique for conserving the main battery charge is to  fly the aircraft to the airport of intended landing while using  the standby battery. A two-position battery master/ alternator  rocker switch is installed on most aircraft with EFDs, which  can be utilized to isolate the main battery from the electrical  system. By switching the MASTER side off, the battery is  taken offline and the standby battery comes online to power the  essential bus. However, the standby battery switch must be in  the ARM position for this to occur.  [Figure 11-6]  Utilization  of the standby battery first reserves the main battery for use  when approaching to land. With this technique, electrical  power may be available for the use of flaps, gear, lights, etc. Do  not rely on any power to be available after the standby battery  has exhausted itself. Once the charging system has failed,  flight with a powered electrical system is not guaranteed.  

![](images/8ce55c6c8f06d01e76687ae55329bea89742044e5a7fb706614741936a55d1f4.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.  Note the double rocker switch and the standby battery  switch in this aircraft. The standby battery must be armed to work  correctly; arming should be done prior to departure.  

# Operating on the Main Battery  

While en route to the airport of intended landing, reduce the  electrical load as much as practical. Turn off all unnecessary  electrical items, such as duplicate radios, non-essential  lighting, etc. If unable to turn off radios, lights, etc., manually,  consider pulling circuit breakers to isolate those pieces of  equipment from the electrical system. Keep in mind that  once the standby battery has exhausted its charge, the flight  deck may become very dark depending on what time of  day the failure occurs. The priority during this emergency  situation is landing the aircraft as soon as possible without  jeopardizing safety.  

A standby attitude indicator, altimeter, airspeed indicator (ASI)  and magnetic compass are installed in each aircraft for use  when the PFD instrumentation is unavailable.  [Figure 11-7] These would be the only instruments left available to the pilot.  Navigation would be limited to pilotage and dead reckoning  unless a hand-held transceiver with a global positioning  system (GPS)/navigation function is onboard.  

Once an alternator failure has been detected, the pilot must  reduce the electrical load on the battery and land as soon as  practical. Depending upon the electrical load and condition  of the battery, there may be sufficient power available for  45 minutes of flight—or for only a matter of minutes. Pilots  should also know which systems on the aircraft are electric and  

![](images/f2d9dd5402e8e573f0de8f80a0557f5b4e7e4e57e569d3c67930fc8c010743e2.jpg)  
Figure 11-7.   Emergency instrumentation available to the pilot on electronic flight instrumented aircraft.  

those that continue to operate without electrical power. Pilots  can attempt to troubleshoot alternator failure by following the  established alternator failure procedure published in the POH/ AFM. If the alternator cannot be reset, advise ATC of the  situation and inform them of the impending electrical failure.  

# Analog Instrument Failure  

A warning indicator, or an inconsistency between indications  on the attitude indicator and the supporting performance  instruments, usually identifies system or instrument failure.  Aircraft control must be maintained while identifying the  failed component(s). Expedite the cross-check and include  all flight instruments. The problem may be individual  instrument failure or a system failure affecting multiple  instruments.  

One method of identification involves an immediate  comparison of the attitude indicator with the rate-of-turn  indicator and vertical speed indicator (VSI). Along with  providing pitch-and-bank information, this technique  compares the static system with the suction or pressure system  and the electrical system. Identify the failed component(s)  and use the remaining functional instruments to maintain  aircraft control.  

Attempt to restore the inoperative component(s) by checking  the appropriate power source, changing to a backup or  alternate system, and resetting the instrument if possible.  

Covering the failed instrument(s) may enhance a pilot’s  ability to maintain aircraft control and navigate the aircraft.  Usually, the next step is to advise ATC of the problem and,  if necessary, declare an emergency before the situation  deteriorates beyond the pilot’s ability to recover.  

# Pneumatic System Failure  

One possible cause of instrument failure is a loss of the  suction or pressure source. This pressure or suction is  supplied by a vacuum pump mechanically driven off the  engine. Occasionally these pumps fail, leaving the pilot with  inoperative attitude and heading indicators.  

Figure 11-8  illustrates inoperative vacuum driven attitude  and heading indicators that can fail progressively. As the  gyroscopes slow down, they may wander, which, if connected  to the autopilot and/or flight director, can cause incorrect  movement or erroneous indications. In  Figure 11-8,  the  aircraft is actually level and at 2,000 feet mean sea level  (MSL). It is not in a turn to the left which the pilot may  misinterpret if he or she fails to see the off or failed flags.  If that occurs, the pilot may transform a normally benign  situation into a hazardous situation. Again, good decision- making by the pilot only occurs after a careful analysis of  systems.  

Many small aircraft are not equipped with a warning system  for vacuum failure; therefore, the pilot should monitor the  

![](images/7fb68d5d0173e42e2feeb211e088a4183706a2a1e2f158846d2a2eb6b5db2a9a.jpg)

system’s vacuum/pressure gauge. This can be a hazardous  situation with the potential to lead the unsuspecting pilot into  a dangerous unusual attitude that would require a partial panel  recovery. It is important that pilots practice instrument flight  without reference to the attitude and heading indicators in  preparation for such a failure.  

# Pitot/Static System Failure  

A pitot or static system failure can also cause erratic and  unreliable instrument indications. When a static system  problem occurs, it affects the ASI, altimeter, and the VSI.  In most aircraft, provisions have been made for the pilot to  select an alternate static source. Check the POH/AFM for  the location and operation of the alternate static source. In  the absence of an alternate static source, in an unpressurized  aircraft, the pilot could break the glass on the VSI. The VSI  is not required for instrument flight, and breaking the glass  provides the altimeter and the ASI a source of static pressure.  This procedure could cause additional instrument errors.  

# Communication/Navigation System  Malfunction  

Avionics equipment has become very reliable, and the  likelihood of a complete communications failure is remote.  However, each IFR flight should be planned and executed in  anticipation of a two-way radio failure. At any given point  during a flight, the pilot must know exactly what route to fly,  what altitude to fly, and when to continue beyond a clearance  limit. Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 91 describes the procedures to be followed in case of a  two-way radio communications failure. If operating in VFR  conditions at the time of the failure, the pilot should continue  the flight under VFR and land as soon as practicable. If the  failure occurs in IFR conditions, or if VFR conditions cannot  be maintained, the pilot must continue the flight:  

1.	 Along the route assigned in the last ATC clearance  received; 2.	 If being radar vectored, by the direct route from the  point of radio failure to the fix, route, or airway specified  in the vector clearance; 3.	 In the absence of an assigned route, by the route  that ATC has advised may be expected in a further  clearance; or 4.	 In the absence of an assigned route or a route that ATC  has advised may be expected in a further clearance,  by the route filed in the flight plan.  

The pilot should maintain the highest of the following  altitudes or flight levels for the route segment being flown:  

1.	 The altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC  clearance received; 2.	 The minimum altitude (converted, if appropriate, to  minimum flight level as prescribed in 14 CFR, part  91 for IFR operations); or 3.	 The altitude or flight level ATC has advised may be  expected in a further clearance.  

In addition to route and altitude, the pilot must also plan the  progress of the flight to leave the clearance limit.  

1.	 When the clearance limit is a fix from which an  approach begins, commence descent or descent  and approach as close as possible to the expect- further-clearance time if one has been received. If an  expect-further-clearance time has not been received,  commence descent or descent and approach as close as  possible to the estimated time of arrival as calculated  from the filed or amended (with ATC) estimated time  en route.  

2.	 If the clearance limit is not a fix from which an  approach begins, leave the clearance limit at the  expect-further-clearance time if one has been received.  If no expect-further-clearance time has been received,  leave the clearance limit upon arrival over it, and  proceed to a fix from which an approach begins and  commence descent or descent and approach as close as  possible to the estimated time of arrival as calculated  from the filed or amended (with ATC) estimated time  en route.  [Figure 11-8]  

While following these procedures, set the transponder to  code 7600, and use all means possible to reestablish two-way  radio communication with ATC. This includes monitoring  navigational aids (NAVAIDs), attempting radio contact with  other aircraft, and attempting contact with a nearby flight  service station (FSS).  

# GPS Nearest Airport Function  

Procedures for accessing the nearest airport information vary  by the type of display installed in an aircraft. Pilots can obtain  information relative to the nearest airport by using the PFD,  multi-function display (MFD), or the nearest function on the  GPS receiver. The following examples are based on a popular  system. Pilots should become familiar with the operational  characteristics of the equipment to be used.  

# Nearest Airports Using the PFD  

With the advancements in electronic databases, diverting to  alternate airports has become easier. Simply by pressing a soft  key on the PFD, pilots can access information for up to 25 of  the nearest airports that meet the criteria set in the systems  configuration page.  [Figure 11-9]  Pilots are able to specify  what airports are acceptable for their aircraft requirements  based on landing surface and length of runway.  

When the text box opens, the flashing cursor is located over  the nearest airport that meets the criteria set in the auxiliary  setup page as shown in  Figure 11-10 . Scrolling through the  25 airports is accomplished by turning the outer FMS knob,  which is located on the lower right corner of the display  screen. Turning the FMS knob clockwise moves the blinking  cursor to the next closest airport. By continuing to turn the  knob, the pilot is able to scroll through all 25 nearest airports.  Each airport box contains the information illustrated in  

![](images/93ee53ab611a1a4d5f61f74c7c0d5f2b7739db52be404905591e5710f825c7ae.jpg)  
Figure 11-9.   The default soft key menu that is displayed on the PFD contains a “NRST” (Nearest Airport) soft key. Pressing this soft  key opens a text box that displays the nearest 25 airports.  Figure 11-9.   The default soft key Menu that is displayed on the

# Additional Information for a Specific Airport  

In addition to the information that is presented on the first  screen, the pilot can view additional information as shown in  Figure 11-12  by highlighting the airport identifier and then  pressing the enter key.  

From this menu or the previous default nearest airport screen,  the pilot is able to activate the Direct-To function, which  provides a direct GPS course to the airport. In addition,  the pilot can auto-tune communication frequencies by  highlighting the appropriate frequency and then pressing  the enter key. The frequency is placed in the stand-by box  of either COM1 or COM2, whichever frequency has the  cyan box around it.  

![](images/25fa587fdc67973b744c384defaa62b97d303ba2d37e4d26d8ea4fc4e11ac46f.jpg)  
Figure 11-12.   Information shown on the additional information  page that will aid the pilot in making a more informed decision  about which airport to choose when diverting.  

# Nearest Airports Using the MFD  

A second way to determine the nearest airport is by  referencing the NRST Page Group located on the MFD. This  method provides additional information to the pilot; however,  it may require additional steps to view.  [Figure 11-13]  

# Navigating the MFD Page Groups  

Most display systems are designed for ease of navigation  through the different screens on the MFD. Notice the  various page groups in the lower right corner of the MFD  screen. Navigation through these four page groups is  accomplished by turning the outer FMS knob clockwise.  [Figure 11-14]  

Within each page group are specific pages that provide  additional information pertaining to that specific group. Once  the desired page group and page is selected, the MFD remains  in that configuration until the page is changed or the CLR  button is depressed for more than 2 seconds. Holding the CLR  button returns the display to the default moving map page.  

# Nearest Airport Page Group  

The nearest airport page contains specific areas of interest  for the airport selected.  [Figure 11-15]  The pilot is furnished  information regarding runways, frequencies, and types of  approaches available.  

# Nearest Airports Page Soft Keys  

Figure 11-16  illustrates four specific soft keys that allow  the pilot to access independent windows of the airport page.  Selection of each of these windows can also be accomplished  by utilizing the MENU hard key.  

![](images/9f9e6d94d440ae9fb54d9a09e5ee4fae348a6b70cb877ff3c6645a0bffb74be7.jpg)  
Figure 11-13.   The MFD is another means of viewing the nearest airports.

Figure 11-14.   Figure 11-14.   Page groups. As the FMS outer knob is rotated, the  current page group is indicated by highlighting the specific group  indicator. Notice that the   MAP page group   is   highlighted .  

The soft keys and functions are as follows: Scroll through  each section with the cursor, then press enter to accept the  selection.  

1.	 APT. Allows the user access to scroll through the  25 nearest airports. The white arrow indicates which  airport is selected. The INFORMATION window  is slaved to the white arrow. The INFORMATION  window decodes the airport identifier. Scroll through  the 25 airports by turning the outer FMS knob.  

2.	 RNWY. Moves the cursor into the Runways section  and allows the user to scroll through the available  runways at a specific airport that is selected in  conjunction with the APT soft key. A green arrow  indicates additional runways to view.  

3.	 FREQ. Moves the cursor into the Frequencies section  and allows the pilot to highlight and auto-tune the  frequency into the selected standby box.  

4.	 APR. Moves the cursor into the Approach section and  allows the pilot to review approaches and load them  into the flight plan. When the APR soft key is selected,  an additional soft key appears. The LD APR (Load  Approach) soft key must be pressed once the desired  instrument approach procedure has been highlighted.  Once the soft key is pressed, the screen changes to the  PROC Page Group. From this page, the pilot is able to  choose the desired approach, the transition, and choose  the option to activate the approach or just load it into  the flight plan.  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is not simply a mental picture of  aircraft location; rather, it is an overall assessment of each  element of the environment and how it affects a flight. On  one end of the situational awareness spectrum is a pilot who  

![](images/47fc3add2ddc75ae9860c8f0e24b2156a9992c254b44555c6a196b425dfc066c.jpg)  
Figure 11-15.   The page group of nearest airports has been selected.  

is knowledgeable of every aspect of the flight; consequently,  this pilot’s decision-making is proactive. With good  situational awareness, this pilot is able to make decisions  well ahead of time and evaluate several different options.  On the other end of the situational awareness spectrum is a  pilot who is missing important pieces of the puzzle: “I knew  exactly where I was when I ran out of fuel.” Consequently,  this pilot’s decision-making is reactive. With poor situational  awareness, a pilot lacks a vision of future events and is forced  to make decisions quickly, often with limited options.  

During a typical IFR flight, a pilot operates at varying levels  of situational awareness. For example, a pilot may be cruising  to his or her destination with a high level of situational  awareness when ATC issues an unexpected standard terminal  arrival route (STAR). Since the pilot was not expecting the  STAR and is not familiar with it, situational awareness is  lowered. However, after becoming familiar with the STAR  and resuming normal navigation, the pilot returns to a higher  level of situational awareness.  

Factors that reduce situational awareness include: distractions,  unusual or unexpected events, complacency, high workload,  unfamiliar situations, and inoperative equipment. In some  situations, a loss of situational awareness may be beyond a  pilot’s control. For example, a pneumatic system failure and  associated loss of the attitude and heading indicators could  cause a pilot to find his or her aircraft in an unusual attitude.  In this situation, established procedures must be used to  regain situational awareness.  

Pilots should be alert to a loss of situational awareness  anytime they are in a reactive mindset. To regain situational  awareness, reassess the situation and seek additional  information from other sources, such as the navigation  instruments or ATC.  

# Traffic Avoidance  

EFDs have the capability of displaying transponder-equipped  aircraft on the MFD, as well as the inset map on the PFD.  However, due to the limitations of the systems, not all traffic  is displayed. Some traffic information service (TIS) units  display only eight intruding targets within the service volume.  The normal service volume has altitude limitations of 3,500  feet below the aircraft to 3,500 feet above the aircraft. The  lateral limitation is 7 NM.  [Figure 11-17]  Pilots unfamiliar  with the limitations of the system may rely on the aural  warnings to alert them to approaching traffic.  

In addition to an outside visual scan of traffic, a pilot should  incorporate any traffic information electronically displayed,  such as TIS. This innovation in traffic alerting reinforces and  adds synergy to the ability to see and avoid. However, it is  an aid and not a replacement for the responsibilities of the

pilot. Systems such as TIS provide a visual representation  of nearby traffic and displays a symbol on the moving map  display with relative information about altitude, vertical  trends, and direction of flight.  [Figure 11-18]  

It is important to remember that most systems display only a  specific maximum number of targets allowed. Therefore, it  does not mean that the targets displayed are the only aircraft  in the vicinity. The system displays only the closest aircraft.  In addition, the system does not display aircraft that are not  equipped with transponders. The display may not show any  aircraft; however, a Piper Cub with no transponder could be  flying in the area. TIS coverage can be sporadic and is not  available in some areas of the United States. Traffic advisory  software is to be utilized only for increased situational  awareness and not the sole means of traffic avoidance. There is  no substitute for a good visual scan of the surrounding sky.

# Appendix A  

Clearance Shorthand The following shorthand system is recommended by the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Applicants for the  instrument rating may use any shorthand system, in any  language, which ensures accurate compliance with air traffic  control (ATC) instructions. No shorthand system is required  by regulation and no knowledge of shorthand is required for  the FAA Knowledge Test; however, because of the vital need  for reliable communication between the pilot and controller,  clearance information should be unmistakably clear.  

The following symbols and contractions represent words  and phrases frequently used in clearances. Most are used  regularly by ATC personnel. By practicing this shorthand,  omitting the parenthetical words, you will be able to copy  long clearances as fast as they are read.  

Example: CAF   $\twoheadrightarrow$   RH RV V18 40 SQ 0700 DPC 120.4 Cleared as filed, maintain runway heading for radar vector  to Victor 18, climb to 4,000, squawk 0700, departure control  frequency is 120.4.

Instrument Training Lesson Guide  

# Introduction  

Flight instructors may use this guide in the development of  lesson plans. The lessons are arranged in a logical learning  sequence and use the building-block technique. Each lesson  includes ground training appropriate to the flight portion of  the lesson. It is vitally important that the flight instructor brief  the student on the objective of the lesson and how it will be  accomplished. Debriefing the student’s performance is also  necessary to motivate further progress. To ensure steady  progress, student pilots should master the objective of each  lesson before advancing to the next lesson. Lessons should  be arranged to take advantage of each student’s knowledge  and skills.  

Flight instructors must monitor progress closely during  training to guide student pilots in how to properly divide  their attention. The importance of this division of attention  or “cross-check” cannot be overemphasized. Cross-check and  proper instrument interpretation are essential components  of “attitude instrument flying” that enables student pilots to  accurately visualize the aircraft’s attitude at all times.  

When possible, each lesson should incorporate radio  communications, basic navigation, and emergency procedures  so the student pilot is exposed to the entire IFR experience  with each flight. Cross-reference the Instrument Training  Lesson Guide with this handbook and the Instrument  Practical Test Standards for a comprehensive instrument  rating training program.
