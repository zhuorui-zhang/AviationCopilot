# Instrument Procedures  Handbook  

2017  

# Preface  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8261-16A, Instrument Procedures Handbook, dated 2015. It is designed as a technical  reference for all pilots who operate under instrument flight rules (IFR) in the National Airspace System (NAS). It expands  and updates information contained in the FAA-H-8083-15B, Instrument Flying Handbook, and introduces advanced  information for IFR operations. Instrument flight instructors, instrument pilots, and instrument students will also find this  handbook a valuable resource since it is used as a reference for the Airline Transport Pilot and Instrument Knowledge Tests  and for the Practical Test Standards. It also provides detailed coverage of instrument charts and procedures including IFR  takeoff, departure, en route, arrival, approach, and landing. Safety information covering relevant subjects such as runway  incursion, land and hold short operations, controlled flight into terrain, and human factors issues also are included.  

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the Federal Aviation Administration 

 (FAA). The discussion and explanations reflect the most commonly used instrument procedures. Occasionally, the word 

 “must”or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended  to add to, interpret, or relieve pilots of their responsibility imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to also become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR and  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). The CFR, AIM, this handbook, AC 00-2.15, Advisory Circular Checklist, which  transmits the current status of FAA advisory circulars, and other FAA technical references are available via the internet  at the FAA Home Page  http://www.faa.gov . Information regarding the purchase of  FAA subscription aeronautical  navigation products, such as charts, Chart Supplements (including the Airport/Facility Directory), and other publications  can be accessed at  http://faacharts.faa.gov .

# Summary of Changes  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-16A, Instrument Procedures Handbook dated 2015, and contains several  changes and updates. While this revision contains updated information, it retains the organization and the same  order of presentation as earlier versions. Some updated graphics and editorial wording changes have been made  for clarity or consistency.  In multiple places, we corrected or updated terminology as follows: “instrument approach  plates” to be “instrument approach charts”; “airplane” to “aircraft” where the context applies to all aircraft;  Airport/  Facility Directory (A/FD) to “Chart Supplement (CS)” or “Digital Chart Supplement (d-CS)” except where the context  refers to the A/FD section of the CS or d-CS; and “Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS)” to “Helicopter Air  Ambulance (HAA)” . We suggest that the content changes, which are listed below, be thoroughly reviewed.  

# Chapter 1  

•  Reworded paragraph “Alternate Minimums for Commercial Operators,” regarding requirements for Part 121 and  135 operators. Clarified a sentence indicating it pertains to alternate airports rather than all airports.  

•  Updated paragraph “Departures from Airports Without an Operating Control Tower”regarding obtaining information  from a Flight Service Station (FSS). Changed references from “Automated Flight Service Station   $(\mathsf{A F S S})^{\prime\prime}$   to “Flight  Service Station (FSS).” Added information about finding the phone number to use, when there is a direct line to  the controlling Air Traffic Control (ATC) Facility, to obtain a clearance.  

# Chapter 2  

•  Added indication that area navigation (RNAV) specific information is sometimes depicted on Victor routes to  paragraph “IFR En Route Low Altitude Chart.”  

•  Updated figure 2-30, which depicts a Joint Victor/RNAV airway route, to be more realistic by removing a Global  Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) minimum en route IFR altitude (MEA) that was a higher altitude than the  conventional MEA for the same fix pair. The GNSS MEA should only be depicted when it is lower than the altitude  of the conventional MEA.  

# Chapter 3  

o   Clarified that STARs end at a fix that allows radar vectors and, at some locations, also allows the option to    connect to an approach.  o   Explained that the descent gradient on a STAR will have to vary to meet altitude restrictions, if any, along    the particular route.  o   Updated the explanation of descent gradient on a STAR based on new guidance in FAA Order 8260.3, U.S.    Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), that was changed in March 2016. 

 •  Changed paragraph “RNAV STARs or STAR Transitions” to the following:  o   Updated the explanation of design guidance for an RNAV STAR.  o   Updated the explanation of the types of clearances for a STAR. 

 •  Changed paragraph “Interpreting the STAR” updating some of the terminology used for a STAR.  

# Chapter 4

 •  Updated paragraph “Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) and Instrument Approaches” incorporating changes to  14 CFR Part 91 and describe the EFVS operation. 

 •  Updated a discussion of RNAV (GPS) approach chart lines of approach minimums in paragraph“Advantages ofWAAS  Enabled LPV Approaches.” 

 •  Changed reference in paragraph “Missed Approach” for EFVS to be 14 CFR Part 91 § 91.176. 

 •  Deleted figure 4-23 due to outdated information. Renumbered subsequent figures and references. 

 •  Updated paragraph “Maximum Acceptable Descent Rates” regarding descent after visual descent point (VDP). 

 •  Reworded paragraph “Visual Approaches” regarding controller and pilot responsibilities. 

 •  Updated paragraph “ILS Approaches” regarding simultaneous approach operations and moved some of the material  to paragraph titled “Simultaneous Approaches to Parallel Runways.”

 •  Changed paragraph “Parallel (Dependent) Approaches” to “Simultaneous Dependent Approaches” and updated  regarding dependent approach operations, the minimum separation distances used by ATC, and examples of chart  notes. 

 •  Changed paragraph “Simultaneous Parallel Approaches” to “Simultaneous Independent Approaches” and updated  regarding simultaneous independent approach operations, aircraft equipment requirements (such as FD or AP),  minimum runway spacing, and the lines of minimums that may be used. 

 •  Updated paragraph “Simultaneous Close Parallel Precision Runway Monitor Approaches” regarding Close Parallel  simultaneous independent approach operations. An updated list is provided showing differences for precision runway  monitor (PRM) approaches compared to other simultaneous approaches, minimum runway spacing has decreased,  and (as shown in figure 4-48) RNAV approaches may now be used for simultaneous close parallel operations based  on safety studies in the past few years. 

 •  Updated paragraph “Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches (SOIAs)” regarding SOIA operations, the types of  approaches that are authorized, and the type of surveillance equipment required. 

 •  Updated figure 4-43 depiction of simultaneous approach operations. 

 •  Revised titles for figures 4-43 through 4-49 to match the type of ATC operation and/or the approach name or type  that is depicted. 

 •  Updated explanatory note on figure 4-45 showing the range of different simultaneous operations that might apply. 

 •  Revised titles for figures 4-46 and 4-47; updated figures to show examples of simultaneous operations. 

 •  Revised title for figure 4-48 and updated example of a simultaneous close parallel approach and the associated  Attention All Users Page. 

 •  Revised title for figure 4-49 and updated example of a simultaneous offset Instrument approach and the associated  Attention All Users Page.

# Departure Procedures  

# Introduction  

Thousands of instrument flight rules (IFR) takeoffs and  departures occur daily in the National Airspace System  (NAS). In order to accommodate this volume of IFR traffic, air  traffic control (ATC) must rely on pilots to use charted airport  sketches and diagrams, as well as departure procedures 

 (DPs) that include both standard instrument departures 

 (SIDs) and obstacle departure procedures (ODPs). While  many charted (and uncharted) departures are based on  radar vectors, the bulk of IFR departures in the NAS require  pilots to navigate out of the terminal environment to the  en route phase.  

IFR takeoffs and departures are fast-paced phases of  flight, and pilots often are overloaded with critical flight  information. While preparing for takeoff, pilots are busy  requesting and receiving clearances, preparing their aircraft  for departure, and taxiing to the active runway. During IFR  conditions, they are doing this with minimal visibility, and  they may be without constant radio communication if flying  out of a non-towered airport. Historically, takeoff minimums  for commercial operations have been successively reduced  through a combination of improved signage, runway  markings and lighting aids, and concentrated pilot  training and qualifications. Today at major terminals, some  commercial operators with appropriate equipment, pilot  qualifications, and approved Operations Specifications  (OpSpecs) may takeoff with visibility as low as 300 feet  runway visual range (RVR). One of the consequences of  takeoffs with reduced visibility is that pilots are challenged  in maintaining situational awareness during taxi operations.  

# Surface Movement Safety  

One of the biggest safety concerns in aviation is the surface  movement accident. As a direct result, the FAA has rapidly  expanded the information available to pilots, including  the addition of taxiway and runway information in FAA  publications, particularly the IFR U.S. Terminal Procedures  Publication (TPP) booklets and the Chart Supplement (CS)  volumes. The FAA has also implemented new procedures  and created educational and awareness programs for  pilots, ATC, and ground operators. By focusing resources  to attack this problem head on, the FAA hopes to reduce  and eventually eliminate surface movement accidents.  

# Airport Sketches and Diagrams  

Airport sketches and diagrams provide pilots of all levels  with graphical depictions of the airport layout. Aeronautical  Information Services, formerly known as Aeronautical  Products (AeroNav), provide an airport sketch on the lower  left or right portion of every instrument approach chart.  [Figure 1-1] This sketch depicts the runways, their length,  width and slope, the touchdown zone elevation, the lighting  system installed on the end of the runway, and taxiways.  Graphical depictions of NOTAMS are also available for  selected airports as well as for temporary flight restriction  (TFRs) areas on the defense internet NOTAM service (DINS)  website.  

For select airports, typically those with heavy traffic or  complex runway layouts, Aeronautical Information Services  also prints an airport diagram. The diagram is located in  the IFR TPP booklet following the instrument approach  chart for a particular airport. It is a full page depiction of  the airport that includes the same features of the airport  sketch plus additional details, such as taxiway identifiers,  

![](images/c518c155b324f6c161f1c65aa620737390f344921c61ddc2c936f57c8bbc97e5.jpg)

airport latitude and longitude, and building identification.  The airport diagrams are also available in the Airport/Facility  Directory section of the Chart Supplement (CS) and on the  Aeronautical Information Services' website, located at  www.aeronav.faa.gov. [Figure 1-2]  

# Chart Supplements (CS)  

In recent years, the former Airport/Facility Directory (A/  FD) booklet was incorporated as a section in the Chart  Supplement (CS). [Figure 2-14] The Chart Supplement  (CS) is published by Aeronautical Information Services in  regional booklets and online at: [https://www.faa.gov/  air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital products/dafd/]  The online version is known as the digital Chart Supplement  (d-CS). The d-CS and the CS are identical and provide  textual and graphic information about all airports, both  Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and IFR. The Airport/Facility  Directory (A/FD) section of the CS includes runway length  

![](images/ea0493995662b67db987e04b24c9d880e830e4d0eae247428a2f316002f8a705.jpg)

and width, runway surface, load bearing capacity, runway  slope, runway declared distances, airport services, and  hazards, such as birds and reduced visibility. [Figure 1-3]  Sketches of airports also are being added to aid VFR pilots in  surface movement activities. In support of the FAA Runway  Incursion Program, full page airport diagrams and “Hot  Spot” locations are included in the A/FD section of the CS.  These charts are the same as those published in the IFR  TPP and are printed for airports with complex runway or  taxiway layouts.  

# Surface Movement Guidance Control System  (SMGCS)  

The Surface Movement Guidance Control System  (SMGCS) was developed to facilitate the safe movement  of aircraft and vehicles at airports where scheduled  air carriers were conducting authorized operations.  Advisory Circular 120-57 was developed in 1992.  In 2012,  FAA Order 8000.94, Procedures for Establishing Airport  Low-Visibility Operations and Approval of Low-Visibility  Operations/Surface Movement Guidance and Control  System Operations, was published to provide procedures  for establishing Airport Low-Visibility Operations (LVO)  and Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems.  It  established the necessary FAA headquarters and operating  services, roles, responsibilities, and activities for operations  at 14 CFR Part 139 airports using RVRs of less than 1,200  feet for each runway.  The order applies to all users of  the system at all levels who are formally listed.  The FAA  requires the commissioning of an “FAA approved LVO/  SMGCS Operation” for all new Category III ILS supported  runways. Since there are no regulatory takeoff minimums  for 14 CFR Part 91 operations, the information provided by  FAA AC 120-57 and FAA Order 8000.94 must be understood  so that the general aviation pilot can understand LVO and  SMGCS during day or night.  

The SMGCS low visibility taxi plan includes the enhancement  of taxiway and runway signs, markings, and lighting,  as well as the creation of SMGCS visual aid diagrams.  [Figure 1-4] The plan also clearly identifies taxi routes  and their supporting facilities and equipment. Airport  enhancements that are part of the SMGCS program include,  but are not limited to:  

•   Controllable Stop bars lights—these consist of a row  of red, unidirectional, in-pavement lights that can be  controlled by ATC. They provide interactions with  and aircraft that prevent runway incursions during  takeoff operations.  These are required for operations  at less than 500 ft RVR .  •   Non-Controllable Stop bars lights—these are red,  unidirectinoal lights place at intersections where a  restriction to movement is required. They must be  in continuous operation at less than 500 ft RVR.  •   Taxiway centerline lead-on lights—guide ground  traffic under low visibility conditions and at night.  These lights consist of alternating green/yellow in- pavement lights.  •   Runway guard lights—either elevated or in- pavement, may be installed at all taxiways that  provide access to an active runway. They consist  of alternately flashing yellow lights. These lights  are used to denote both the presence of an active  runway and identify the location of a runway holding  position marking.  •   Geographic position markings—ATC verifies the  position of aircraft and vehicles using geographic  position markings. The markings can be used either  as hold points or for position reporting. These  checkpoints or “pink spots” are outlined with a black  and white circle and designated with a number or a  number and a letter.

clearance bar lights used to denote holding  positions for aircraft and vehicles. When used for  hold points, they are co-located with geographic  position markings.  

Both flight and ground crews, Part 121 and 135 operators, are  required to comply with SMGCS plans when implemented  at their specific airport. All airport tenants are responsible  for disseminating information to their employees and  conducting training in low visibility operating procedures.  Anyone operating in conjunction with the SMGCS plan  must have a copy of the low visibility taxi route chart for  their given airport as these charts outline the taxi routes  and other detailed information concerning low visibility  operations. These charts are available from private sources  outside of the FAA. Government sources for SMGCS  charts may be available in the future. Part 91 operators  are expected to comply with the guidelines listed in AC  120-57, and should expect “Follow Me” service (when  available) when low visibility operations are in use. Any  SMGCS outage that would adversely affect operations at  Advanced Surface Movement Guidance Control  System (A-SMGCS)  

With the increasing demand for airports to accommodate  higher levels of aircraft movements, it is becoming more  difficult for the existing infrastructure to safely handle  greater capacities of traffic in all weather conditions. As  a result, the FAA is implementing runway safety systems,  such as Airport Surface Detection Equipment-Model X  (ASDE-X) and Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and  Control System (A-SMGCS) at various airports. The data that  these systems use comes from surface movement radar  and aircraft transponders. The combination of these data  sources allows the systems to determine the position and  identification of aircraft on the airport movement area and  decreases the potential of collisions on airport runways  and taxiways.  

Additional information concerning airport lighting,  markings, and signs can be found in the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM) and the Pilot’s Handbook of

Aeronautical Knowledge, appendix 1, as well as on the FAA’s  website at  http://www.faa.gov/airports/runway_safety/ .  

# Airport Signs, Lighting, and Markings  

Flight crews use airport lighting, markings, and signs to  help maintain situational awareness. These visual aids  provide information concerning the aircraft’s location on  the airport, the taxiway in use, and the runway entrance  being used. Overlooking this information can lead to  ground accidents that are entirely preventable. If you  encounter unfamiliar markings or lighting, contact ATC  for clarification and, if necessary, request progressive taxi  instructions. Pilots are encouraged to notify the appropriate  authorities of erroneous, misleading, or decaying signs or  lighting that would contribute to the failure of safe ground  operations.  

# Runway Incursions  

On any given day, the NAS may handle almost 200,000  takeoffs and landings. Due to the complex nature of the  airport environment and the intricacies of the network of  people that make it operate efficiently, the FAA is constantly  looking to maintain the high standard of safety that exists  at airports today. Runway safety is one of its top priorities.  The FAA defines a runway incursion as: “Any occurrence  at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an  aircraft, vehicle, or person on the protected area of a surface  designated for the landing and takeoff of aircraft.”  

The four categories of runway incursions are listed below:  

•   Category A—a serious incident in which a collision  was narrowly avoided.  •   Category B—an incident in which separation  decreases and there is a significant potential for  

# The F AA recommends  that you:

The sterile cockpit rule refers to a concept outlined in 14 CFR Part 121,  $\S\,121.542$   and 135.100 that requires fl ight  crews to refrain from engaging in activities that could distract  them from the performance of their duties during critical phases  of fl ight.

collision that may result in a time critical corrective/  evasive response to avoid a collision.  •   Category C—an incident characterized by ample  time and/or distance to avoid a collision.  •   Category D—an incident that meets the definition  

of runway incursion, such as incorrect presence of a  single vehicle/person/aircraft on the protected area  of a surface designated for the landing and takeoff of  aircraft but with no immediate safety consequences.  

Figure 1-5 highlights several steps that reduce the chances  of being involved in a runway incursion.  

In addition to the SMGCS program, the FAA has implemented  additional programs to reduce runway incursions and other  surface movement issues. They identified runway hotspots,  designed standardized taxi routes, and instituted the  Runway Safety Program.  

# Runway Hotspots  

ICAO defines runway hotspots as a location on an  aerodrome movement area with a history or potential risk  of collision or runway incursion and where heightened  attention by pilots and drivers is necessary. Hotspots  alert pilots to complex or potentially confusing taxiway  geometry that could make surface navigation challenging.  Whatever the reason, pilots need to be aware that  these hazardous intersections exist, and they should  be increasingly vigilant when approaching and taxiing  through these intersections. These hotspots are depicted  on some airport charts as circled areas. [Figure 1-6] The FAA  Office of Runway Safety has links to the FAA regions that  maintain a complete list of airports with runway hotspots  at  http://www.faa.gov/airports/runway_safety .  

# Standardized Taxi Routes  

Standard taxi routes improve ground management at high-   density airports, namely those that have airline service. At  these airports, typical taxiway traffic patterns used to move  aircraft between gate and runway are laid out and coded.  The ATC specialist (ATCS) can reduce radio communication  time and eliminate taxi instruction misinterpretation by  simply clearing the pilot to taxi via a specific, named route.  An example of this would be Los Angeles International  Airport (KLAX), where North Route is used to transition  to Runway 24L. [Figure 1-7] These routes are issued by  ground control, and if unable to comply, pilots must  advise ground control on initial contact. If for any reason  the pilot becomes uncertain as to the correct taxi route, a  request should be made for progressive taxi instructions.  These step-by-step routing directions are also issued if the  controller deems it necessary due to traffic, closed taxiways,  airport construction, etc. It is the pilot’s responsibility to  know if a particular airport has preplanned taxi routes, to  be familiar with them, and to have the taxi descriptions in  their possession. Specific information about airports that  use coded taxiway routes is included in the Notices to  Airmen Publication (NTAP).  

# At Long Beach/Daugherty Field Airport, the following areas have been  designated as hot spots, posing a special challenge to pilots.  

![](images/6ad7fd21ef263b17f9230b7b671a0f24bebaeffe60a8fcd5dc6aae6e88682314.jpg)  

Be aware that this runway crosses every other available runway  at the airport. When exiting the runway, pilots should make sure  they are turning with a “lead-off” taxiline onto a taxiway and not  onto another active runway.  

# HOT 1  

Runway 25R and Taxiway D  Aircraft exiting runway 30 at taxiway A turn  left on taxiway D, anticipate reaching their  destination, and fail to hold short of runway  25R.  

# HOT 2  

Runway 12 and Taxiway B  Aircraft northbound on taxiway B for departure  on runway 16R at taxiway intersection D miss  the right turn onto taxiway D and enter  runways 12, 7L, and 25R.  

# HOT 3  

Runway 25L/7R at Taxiway B  Aircraft southbound on taxiway B anticipate  reaching their destination parking ramp and  fail to hold short of runway 25L/7R.  

# HOT 4  

Runway 16R/34L at Taxiway F  Aircraft taxiing to runway 16R from the  southwest ramp miss the left turn onto  taxiway B, continue eastbound onto taxiway  F, and enter runway 16R/34L.  

# HOT 5  

Runway 25L at Taxiway D  After completing a runup on inactive runway  34R, aircraft fail to hold short of runway 25L.

# Taxi and Movement Operations Change  

As of June 30, 2010, controllers are required to issue explicit  instructions to cross or hold short of each runway that  intersects a taxi route. Following is a summary of these  procedural changes:  

•   “Taxi to” is no longer used when issuing taxi  instructions to an assigned takeoff runway.  •   Instructions to cross a runway are issued one at a  time. Instructions to cross multiple runways are not  issued. An aircraft or vehicle must have crossed the  previous runway before another runway crossing  is issued. This applies to any runway, including  inactive or closed runways.  •   Never cross a runway hold marking without explicit  ATC instructions. If in doubt, ask!  

Reminder:  You may not enter a runway unless you have  been:  

1.  Instructed to cross or taxi onto that specific runway;  2.  Cleared to take off from that runway; or  3.  Instructed to line up and wait on that specific runway.  

For more information on the change, refer to FAA Order  JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, which can be found at  www.  faa.gov .  

# Weather and the Departure Environment  Takeoff Minimums  

While mechanical failure is potentially hazardous during  any phase of flight, a failure during takeoff under  instrument conditions is extremely critical. In the event of  an emergency, a decision must be made to either return to  the departure airport or fly directly to a takeoff alternate. If  the departure weather were below the landing minimums  for the departure airport, the flight would be unable to  return for landing, leaving few options and little time to  reach a takeoff alternate.  

In the early years of air transportation, landing minimums  for commercial operators were usually lower than takeoff  minimums. Therefore, it was possible that minimums  allowed pilots to land at an airport but not depart from that  airport. Additionally, all takeoff minimums once included  ceiling, as well as visibility requirements. Today, takeoff  minimums are typically lower than published landing  minimums, and ceiling requirements are only included if  it is necessary to see and avoid obstacles in the departure  area.  

The FAA establishes takeoff minimums for every airport  that has published Standard Instrument Approaches.  These minimums are used by commercially operated  aircraft, namely Part 121 and Part 135 operators. At airports  where minimums are not established, these same carriers  are required to use FAA-designated standard minimums:  1 statute mile (SM) visibility for single- and twin-engine  aircraft, and   $\mathcal{V}2~\mathsf{S M}$   for helicopters and aircraft with more  than two engines.  

Aircraft operating under 14 CFR Part 91 are not required to  comply with established takeoff minimums. Legally, a zero/  zero departure may be made, but it is never advisable. If  commercial pilots who fly passengers on a daily basis must  comply with takeoff minimums, then good judgment and  common sense would tell all instrument pilots to follow  the established minimums as well.  

Aeronautical Information Services charts list takeoff  minimums only for the runways at airports that have other  than standard minimums. These takeoff minimums are  listed by airport in alphabetical order in the front of the TPP  booklet. If an airport has non-standard takeoff minimums,  a      (referred to by some as either the “triangle T” or “trouble   $\mathsf{T}^{\prime\prime}$  ) is placed in the notes sections of the instrument  procedure chart. In the front of the TPP booklet, takeoff  minimums are listed before the obstacle departure  procedure. Some departure procedures allow a departure  with standard minimums provided specific aircraft  performance requirements are met. [Figure 1-8]  

# Takeoff Minimums for Commercial Operators  

While Part 121 and Part 135 operators are the primary users  of takeoff minimums, they may be able to use alternative  takeoff minimums based on their individual OpSpecs.  Through these OpSpecs, operators are authorized to depart  with lower-than-standard minimums provided they have  the necessary equipment and crew training.  

# Operations Specifications (OpSpecs)  

Within the air transportation industry, there is a need to  establish and administer safety standards to accommodate  many variables. These variables include a wide range  of aircraft, varied operator capabilities, the various  situations requiring different types of air transportation,  and the continual, rapid changes in aviation technology.  It is impractical to address these variables through the  promulgation of safety regulations for each and every  type of air transport situation and the varying degrees of  operator capabilities. Also, it is impractical to address the  

![](images/c8c9aaca86f3717a24d15da1b977e4a7b60c3945c9355bc0ed1d27bc4820bf5d.jpg)  
Figure 1-8.  Examples of non-standard takeoff minimums for Colorado Springs, Colorado.  

rapidly changing aviation technology and environment  through the regulatory process. Safety regulations  would be extremely complex and unwieldy if all possible  variations and situations were addressed by regulation.  Instead, the safety standards established by regulation  should usually have a broad application that allows varying  acceptable methods of compliance. The OpSpecs provide  an effective method for establishing safety standards that  address a wide range of variables. In addition, OpSpecs  can be adapted to a specific certificate holder or operator’s  class and size of aircraft and type and kinds of operations.  OpSpecs can be tailored to suit an individual certificate  holder or operator’s needs.  

Part 121 and Part 135 certificate holders  have the ability,  through the use of approved OpSpecs, to use lower-than­ standard takeoff minimums. Depending on the equipment  installed in a specific type of aircraft, the crew training, and  the type of equipment installed at a particular airport, these  operators can depart from appropriately equipped runways  with as little as 300 feet RVR. Additionally, OpSpecs outline  provisions for approach minimums, alternate airports, and  weather services in Volume 3 of FAA Order 8900.1, Flight  Standards Information Management System (FSIMS).

Figure 1-9.  Examples of weather information of various flight  information publications (FLIP).  

# Ceiling and Visibility Requirements  

All takeoffs and departures have visibility minimums (some  may have minimum ceiling requirements) incorporated  into the procedure. There are a number of methods to  report visibility and a variety of ways to distribute these  reports, including automated weather observations. Flight  crews should always check the weather, including ceiling  and visibility information, prior to departure. Never launch  an IFR flight without obtaining current visibility information  immediately prior to departure. Further, when ceiling and  visibility minimums are specified for IFR departure, both  are applicable.  

Weather reporting stations for specific airports across  the country can be located by reviewing the CS. Weather  sources along with their respective phone numbers and  frequencies are listed by airport. Frequencies for weather  sources, such as Automatic Terminal Information Service  (ATIS), Digital Automatic Terminal Information Service  (D-ATIS), Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS),  Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and FAA  Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) are published on  approach charts as well. [Figure 1-9]  

# Visibility  

Visibility is the ability, as determined by atmospheric  conditions and expressed in units of distance, to see  and identify prominent unlighted objects by day and  prominent lighted objects by night. Visibility is reported  as statute miles, hundreds of feet, or meters.  

# Prevailing Visibility  

Prevailing visibility is the greatest horizontal visibility  equaled or exceeded throughout at least half the horizon  circle, which need not necessarily be continuous. Prevailing  visibility is reported in statute miles or fractions of miles.  

# Runway Visibility Value (RVV)  

Runway visibility value is the visibility determined for a  particular runway by a transmissometer. A meter provides  

![](images/c3a7d6f43593ca629f35a0b19caa09aec97062d824007d037932a4405ecc83a8.jpg)  
Figure 1-10.  RVR conversion table.  

continuous indication of the visibility (reported in statute  miles or fractions of miles) for the runway.  RVV is used in lieu  of prevailing visibility in determining minimums for a particular  runway.  

# Tower Visibility  

Tower visibility is the prevailing visibility determined from  the airport traffic control tower at locations that also report  the surface visibility.  

# Runway Visual Range (RVR)  

Runway visual range is an instrumentally derived value,   based on standard calibrations, that represents the   horizontal distance a pilot sees down the runway from the   approach end. It is based on the sighting of either high   intensity runway lights or on the visual contrast of other   targets, whichever yields the greater visual range. RVR, in   contrast to prevailing or runway visibility, is based on what   a pilot in a moving aircraft should see looking down the   runway. RVR is horizontal visual range, not slant visual range.   RVR is reported in hundreds of feet, so the values must be   converted to SM if the visibility in SM is not reported. [Figure   1-10] It is based on the measurement of a transmissometer   made near the touchdown point of the instrument runway   and is reported in hundreds of feet. RVR is used in lieu of   RVV and/or prevailing visibility in determining minimums   for a particular runway.  

# Types of RVR  

The following are types of RVR that may be used:  

•   Touchdown RVR—the RVR visibility readout values  obtained from RVR equipment serving the runway  touchdown zone.  •   Mid-RVR—the RVR readout values obtained from  RVR equipment located near the runway midpoint .  •   Rollout RVR—the RVR readout values obtained from  RVR equipment located nearest the rollout end of  the runway.  •   Far End RVR—when four RVR visibility sensors (VS)  are installed, the far end RVR VS is the touchdown  RVR VS on the reciprocal runway.  The far end sensor  will serve as additional information.  

RVR is the primary visibility measurement used by Part  121 and Part 135 operators with specific visibility reports  and controlling values outlined in their respective OpSpecs.  Under their OpSpecs agreements, the operator must have  specific, current RVR reports, if available, to proceed with an  instrument departure. OpSpecs also outline which visibility  report is controlling in various departure scenarios.

# Adequate Visual Reference  

Another set of lower-than-standard takeoff minimums is  available to Part 121 and Part 135 operations as outlined in  their respective OpSpecs document. When certain types of  visibility reports are unavailable or specific equipment is out  of service, the flight can still depart the airport if the pilot  can maintain adequate visual reference. An appropriate  visual aid must be available to ensure the takeoff surface  can be continuously identified, and directional control can  be maintained throughout the takeoff run. Appropriate  visual aids include high intensity runway lights, runway  centerline lights, runway centerline markings, or other  runway lighting and markings. With adequate visual  references and appropriate OpSpec approval, commercial  operators may take off with a visibility of 1600 RVR or   $\%$  SM.  

# Ceilings  

Ceiling is the height above the earth’s surface of the lowest  layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena that is reported as  broken, overcast, or obscuration and not classified as thin  or partial.  

# Automated Weather Systems  

An automated weather system consists of any of the  automated weather sensor platforms that collect weather  data at airports and disseminate the weather information  via radio and/or landline. The systems consist of the ASOS/  Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS) and the AWOS.  

![](images/3e0e3c6f2df1cf4ad5fda448d9f01fd8086ad80294570522bcd23f95f950f10c.jpg)  
Figure 1-12.  CS entry for an AWOS station.  

These systems are installed and maintained at airports  across the United States by both government (FAA and  National Weather Service (NWS)) and private entities. They  are relatively inexpensive to operate because they require  no outside observer, and they provide invaluable weather  information for airports without operating control towers.  [Figure 1-11]  

AWOS and ASOS/AWSS offer a wide variety of capabilities  and progressively broader weather reports. Automated  systems typically transmit weather every one to two  minutes so the most up-to-date weather information is  constantly broadcast. Basic AWOS includes only altimeter  setting, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and dew  point information. More advanced systems, such as the  ASOS/AWSS and AWOS-3, are able to provide additional  information, such as wind speed, wind gust, wind direction,  variable wind direction, temperature, dew point, altimeter  setting, and density altitude. ASOS/AWSS stations providing  service levels A or B also report RVR. The specific type  of equipment found at a given facility is listed in the CS.  [Figure 1-12]  

The use of the aforementioned visibility reports and  weather services are not limited for Part 91 operators.  Part 121 and 135 operators are bound by their individual  OpSpecs documents and are required to use weather  reports that come from the NWS or other approved  sources. While every operator’s specifications are  individually tailored, most operators are required to use  ATIS, RVR reports, and selected reports from automated  weather stations. All reports coming from an AWOS-3  station are usable for Part 121 and Part 135 operators. Each  type of automated station has different levels of approval  as outlined in individual OpSpecs. Ceiling and visibility  reports given by the tower with the departure information  are always considered official weather, and RVR reports are  typically the controlling visibility reference.  

# Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS)  

ATIS is another valuable tool for gaining weather  information. ATIS is available at most airports that have an  operating control tower, which means the reports on the  ATIS frequency are only available during the regular hours  of tower operation. At some airports that operate part-time  towers, ASOS/AWSS information is broadcast over the  ATIS frequency when the tower is closed. This service is  available only at those airports that have both an ASOS/  AWSS on the field and an ATIS-ASOS/AWSS interface switch  installed in the tower.  

Each ATIS report includes crucial information about  runways and instrument approaches in use, specific  outages, and current weather conditions including  visibility. Visibility is reported in statute miles and may  be omitted if the visibility is greater than five miles. ATIS  weather information comes from a variety of sources  depending on the particular airport and the equipment  installed there. The reported weather may come from a  manual weather observer, weather instruments located  in the tower, or from automated weather stations. This  information, no matter the origin, must be from NWS  approved weather sources for it to be used in the ATIS  report.  

# Digital Automatic Terminal Information Service  (D-ATIS)  

The digital ATIS (D-ATIS) is an alternative method of  receiving ATIS reports. The service provides text messages  to aircraft, airlines, and other users outside the standard  reception range of conventional ATIS via landline and data  link communications to the flight deck. Aircraft equipped  with data link services are capable of receiving ATIS  information over their Aircraft Communications Addressing  and Reporting System (ACARS) unit. This allows the pilots to  read and print out the ATIS report inside the aircraft, thereby  increasing report accuracy and decreasing pilot workload.  

Also, the service provides a computer-synthesized voice  message that can be transmitted to all aircraft within  range of existing transmitters. The Terminal Data Link  System (TDLS) D-ATIS application uses weather inputs  from local automated weather sources or manually entered  meteorological data together with preprogrammed menus  to provide standard information to users. Airports with  D-ATIS capability are listed in the CS.

Figure 1-13.  Examples of IFR alternate minimums.  

It is important to remember that ATIS information is  updated hourly and anytime a significant change in the  weather occurs. As a result, the information is not the most  current report available. Prior to departing the airport, you  need to get the latest weather information from the tower.  ASOS/AWSS and AWOS also provide a source of current  weather, but their information should not be substituted  for weather reports from the tower.  

# IFR Alternate Requirements  

On Aeronautical Information Services charts, standard  alternate minimums are not published. If the airport has  other than standard alternate minimums, they are listed  in the front of the approach chart booklet. The presence  of a triangle with an  $\pmb{\triangle}$   on the approach chart indicates  the listing of alternate minimums should be consulted.  Airports that do not qualify for use as an alternate airport  are designated with an   $\pmb{\triangle}\,\mathsf{N}/\mathsf{A}.$  . [Figure 1-13]  

The requirement for an alternate depends on the aircraft  category, equipment installed, approach navigational aid  (NAVAID), and forecast weather. For example, airports with  only a global positioning system (GPS) approach procedure  cannot be used as an alternate by TSO-C129 or C196 users  unless certain requirements are met (see AIM) even  though the "N/A" has been removed from the approach  chart. For select area navigation (RNAV) GPS and GPS  approach procedures, the "N/A" is being removed so they  may be used as an alternate by aircraft equipped with an  approach-approved Wide Area Augmentation System  (WAAS) receiver complaying with (TSO-C145 or C146)  or TSO-C129 or C196 meeitng certain requirements (see  AIM). Because GPS is not authorized as a substitute means  of navigation guidance when conducting a conventional  approach at an alternate airport, if the approach procedure  requires either distance measuring equipment (DME) or  automatic direction finder (ADF), the aircraft must be  equipped with the appropriate DME or ADF avionics in  order to use the approach as an alternate.  

For aircraft other than helicopters, 14 CFR Part 91  requirements, an alternate airport must be listed on IFR  flight plans if the forecast weather at the destination  airport, for at least one hour before and for one hour after  the estimated time of arrival (ETA), the ceiling is less than  2,000 feet above the airport elevation, and the visibility  is less than 3 SM. One way to remember the rules for  determining the necessity of filing an alternate is the “1, 2,  3 Rule.” For helicopters, similar alternate filing requirements  in 14 CFR Part 91 apply. An alternate must be listed on an  IFR flight plan if at the ETA and for one hour after the ETA,  the ceiling is at least 1,000 feet above the airport elevation,  or at least 400 feet above the lowest applicable approach  minima, whichever is higher, and the visibility is at least  2 SM.  

Not all airports can be used as alternate airports. An airport  may not be qualified for alternate use if the airport NAVAID  is unmonitored, or if it does not have weather reporting  capabilities. For an airport to be used as an alternate,  the forecast weather at that airport must meet certain  qualifications at the ETA. For aircraft other than helicopters,  standard alternate minimums for a precision approach are  a 600-foot ceiling and a 2 SM visibility. For a non-precision  approach, the minimums are an 800-foot ceiling and a 2 SM  visibility. Standard alternate minimums apply unless higher  alternate minimums are listed for an airport. For helicopters,  alternate weather minimums are a ceiling of 200 feet above  the minimum for the approach to be flown, and visibility  at least 1 SM but never less than the minimum visibility for  the approach to be flown.  

# Alternate Minimums for Commercial Operators  

IFR alternate minimums for Part 121 and Part 135 operators  are very specific and have more stringent requirements  than Part 91 operators.  

Part 121 operators are required by their OpSpecs and 14  CFR Part 121, § 121.617 and 121.625 to have a takeoff  alternate airport for their departure airport in addition  to their airport of intended landing if the weather at the  departure airport is below the landing minimums in the  certificate holder’s OpSpecs for that airport. The alternate  must be within two hours flying time for an aircraft with  three or more engines with an engine out in normal cruise  in still air. For two engine aircraft, the alternate must be  within one hour. The airport of intended landing may be  used in lieu of an alternate provided that it meets all the  requirements. Domestic Part 121 operators must also file  for alternate airports when the weather at their destination  airport, from one hour before to one hour after their ETA, is  forecast to be below a 2,000-foot ceiling and/or less than  three miles visibility.  

For alternate airports with at least one operational  navigational facility that provides a straight-in non- precision approach, a straight-in precision approach, or a  circling maneuver from an instrument approach procedure  determine the ceiling and visibility by:  

•   Adding 400 feet to the authorized CAT I height above  airport (HAA)/height above touchdown elevation  (HAT) for ceiling.  

for visibility minimums.  

This is one example of the criteria required for Part 121  operators when calculating minimums. Part 135 operators  are also subject to their own specific rules regarding the  selection and use of alternate minimums as outlined in their  OpSpecs and 14 CFR Part 135, § 135.219 through 135.225,  which are similar to  those used by Part 121 operators with  additional considerations.  

Commercial operators typically use dispatchers to plan  flights, including selecting and filing alternate airports.  The dispatcher considers aircraft performance, aircraft  equipment and its condition, and route of flight when  choosing alternates. In the event changes need to be  made to the flight plan en route due to deteriorating  weather, the dispatcher maintains contact with the flight  crew and reroutes their flight as necessary. Therefore, it is  the pilot’s responsibility to execute the flight as planned  by the dispatcher. To aid in the planning of alternates,  dispatchers have a list of airports that are approved as  alternates so they can quickly determine which airports  should be used for a particular flight. Dispatchers also  use flight planning software that plans routes including  alternates for the flight. This type of software is tailored  for individual operators and includes their normal flight  paths and approved airports. Flight planning software and  services are provided through private sources.  

Though the pilot is the final authority for the flight  and ultimately has full responsibility, the dispatcher is  responsible for creating flight plans that are accurate and  comply with the CFRs. Alternate minimum criteria are only  used as planning tools to ensure the pilot in command and  dispatcher are thinking ahead to the approach phase of  flight. In the event the flight would actually need to divert  to an alternate, the published approach minimums or  lower-than-standard minimums must be used as addressed  in OpSpecs documents.

# Departure Procedures  

Instrument departure procedures are preplanned IFR  procedures that provide obstruction clearance from  the terminal area to the appropriate en route structure.  Primarily, these procedures are designed to provide obstacle  protection for departing aircraft. There are two types of  Departure Procedures (DPs):  

•  Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs) and  •  Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs).  

When an instrument approach is initially developed for an  airport, the need for an ODP is assessed. If an aircraft may  turn in any direction from a runway within the limits of the  assessment area and remain clear of obstacles that runway  passes what is called a diverse departure assessment, and  no ODP is published. A diverse departure assessment  ensures that a prescribed, expanding amount of required  obstacle clearance (ROC) is achieved during the climb-out  until the aircraft can obtain a minimum 1,000 feet ROC in  non-mountainous areas or a minimum 2,000 feet ROC in  mountainous areas. Unless specified otherwise, required  obstacle clearance for all departures, including diverse, is  based on the pilot crossing the departure end of the runway  (DER) at least 35 feet above the DER elevation, climbing to  400 feet above the DER elevation before making the initial  turn, and maintaining a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/  NM, unless required to level off by a crossing restriction,  until the minimum IFR altitude is reached. Following ODP  assessment, a SID may still be established for the purposes  of ATC flow management, system enhancement, or noise  abatement.  

# Design Criteria  

The design of a departure procedure is based on FAA Order  8260.3, United States Standard for Terminal Instrument  Procedures (TERPS), which is a living document that is  updated frequently. Departure design criterion begins  with the assumption of an initial climb of 200 ft/NM after  crossing the DER at a height of at least 35 feet. [Figure 1-14]  The aircraft climb path assumption provides a minimum of  35 feet of additional obstacle clearance above the required  obstacle clearance (ROC), from the DER outward, to absorb  variations ranging from the distance of the static source to  the landing gear, to differences in establishing the minimum  200 ft/NM climb gradient, etc. The ROC is the planned  separation between the obstacle clearance surface (OCS)  and the required climb gradient of 200 ft/NM. The ROC  value is zero at the DER elevation and increases along the  departure route until the ROC value appropriate for en route  flight is achieved. The appropriate ROC value for en route  operations is typically achieved about 25 NM for 1,000 feet  of ROC in non-mountainous areas, and 46 NM for 2,000 feet  of ROC in mountainous areas.  

If taking off from a runway using a diverse departure  (a runway without a published ODP), beyond these  distances the pilot is responsible for obstacle clearance if  not operating on a published route, and if below the MEA  or MOCA of a published route, or below an ATC-assigned  altitude.  [Figure 1-15]  

Recent changes in TERPS criteria make the OCS lower and  more restrictive. [Figure 1-16] However, there are many  departures today that were evaluated under the old criteria  that allowed some obstacle surfaces to be as high as 35 feet  at the DER. [Figure 1-14] Since there is no way for the pilot  to determine whether the departure was evaluated using  the previous or current criteria, and until all departures  have been evaluated using the current criteria, pilots need  to be very familiar with the departure environment and  associated obstacles, especially if crossing the DER at less  than 35 feet.  

All departure procedures are initially assessed for obstacle  clearance based on a 40:1 Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS).  If no obstacles penetrate this 40:1 OCS, the standard 200  ft/NM climb gradient provides a minimum of 48 ft/NM of  clearance above objects that do not penetrate the slope.  The departure design must also include the acquisition  of positive course guidance (PCG), typically within 5 to 10  NM of the DER for straight departures. Even when aircraft  performance greatly exceeds the minimum climb gradient,  the published departure routing must always be flown.  

Airports publish the declared distances in the A/FD section  of the CS. These include takeoff runway available (TORA),  takeoff distance available (TODA), accelerate-stop distance  available (ASDA), and landing distance available (LDA). These  distances are calculated by adding to the full length of paved  runway any applicable clearway or stop-way and subtracting  from that sum the sections of the runway unsuitable for  satisfying the required takeoff run, takeoff, accelerate/stop,  or landing distance as shown in Figure 1-16.  

Optimally, the 40 to 1 slope would work for every departure  design; however, due to terrain and manmade obstacles,  it is often necessary to use alternative requirements to  accomplish a safe, obstacle-free departure design. In  such cases, the design of the departure may incorporate a  climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM, an increase in the  standard takeoff minimums to allow the aircraft to “see and  avoid” the obstacles, a standard climb of 200 ft/NM with a  specified reduced takeoff length, or a combination of these  options and a specific departure route.  

If a departure route is specified, it must be flown in  conjunction with the other options.  

The obstacle environment may require a climb gradient  greater than 200 ft/NM. In these cases, the ROC provided  above obstacles is equivalent to 24 percent of the  published climb gradient. The required climb gradient,  for obstacle purposes on ODPs and SIDs, is obtained by  using the formulas:  

Standard Formula  

$$
\mathsf{C G}=(\frac{48\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{O})-\mathsf{E}}{\mathsf{D}}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{C G}=\underset{0.76\,\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{O}-\mathsf{E}}
$$  

$\mathsf{O}=$   obstacle mean sea level (MSL) elevation  

$\mathsf{E}=$   climb gradient starting MSL elevation  

  ${\mathsf{D}}=$   distance (NM) from DER to the obstacle  

Examples:  

$$
{\frac{2049-1221}{0.76\times3.1}}\,=351.44\qquad{\frac{(48\times3.1+2049)-1221}{3.1}}\,=315.10
$$  

Round to 352 ft/NM  Round to 316 ft/NM  \*Military only  

These formulas are published in FAA Order 8260.3 for  calculating the required climb gradient to clear obstacles.  

The following formula is used for calculating SID climb  gradients for other than obstacles (i.e., ATC requirements):  

$$
\mathsf{C G}=\frac{\mathsf{A}-\mathsf{E}}{\mathsf{D}}
$$  

$\mathsf{A}=\mathsf{\dot{\Delta}}$  “climb to” altitude  

$\mathsf{E}=$   climb gradient starting MSL elevation  

${\mathsf{D}}=$   distance (NM) from the beginning of the climb  

Example:  

Note:  The climb gradient must be equal to or greater than  the gradient required for obstacles along the route of flight.  

The published climb gradient, obstacle or otherwise, is  

![](images/cf6e031fbe5a57aafe17dadfd1a4acd1222dd6a98e61e77b66df24adfa00568a.jpg)  
Figure 1-17.  Rate of climb table.  

treated as a plane which must not be penetrated from  above until reaching the stated height or has reached  the en route environment (e.g., above the MEA, MOCA).  Departure design, including climb gradients, does not  take into consideration the performance of the aircraft; it  only considers obstacle protection for all aircraft. TERPS  criteria assume the aircraft is operating with all available  engines and systems fully functioning. Development of  contingency procedures, required to cover the case of  an engine failure, engine out procedures (EOPs) or other  emergency in flight that may occur after liftoff, is the  responsibility of the operator. When a climb gradient is  required for a specific departure, it is vital that pilots fully  understand the performance of their aircraft and determine  if it can comply with the required climb. The standard  climb of 200 ft/NM is not an issue for most aircraft. When  an increased climb gradient is specified due to obstacle  issues, it is important to calculate aircraft performance,  particularly when flying out of airports at higher altitudes  on warm days. To aid in the calculations, the front matter  of every TPP booklet contains a rate of climb table that  relates specific climb gradients and typical groundspeeds.  [Figure 1-17].  

# Low, Close-In Obstacles  

Obstacles that are located within 1 NM of the DER and  penetrate the 40:1 OCS are referred to as “low, close-in  obstacles” and are also included in the TPP.  These obstacles  

![](images/cf6ea2a93d7f152de84deb554ad2dfee49fb056c482bd8784542e46a9dad6ef7.jpg)

Figure 1-19.  Part 25 turbine-powered, transport category airplane OEI actual (gross) takeoff flight path and OEI net takeoff flight path.  

are less than 200 feet above the DER elevation, within 1 NM  of the runway end, and do not require increased takeoff  minimums. The standard ROC to clear these obstacles  would require a climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM  for a very short distance, only until the aircraft was 200  feet above the DER. To eliminate publishing an excessive  climb gradient, the obstacle above ground level (AGL)/  MSL height and location relative to the DER is noted in the  Takeoff Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures  section of a given TPP booklet. The purpose of this note  is to identify the obstacle and alert the pilot to the height  and location of the obstacle so they can be avoided. This  can be accomplished in a variety of ways:  

•   The pilot may be able to see the obstruction and  maneuver around the obstacle(s) if necessary;  •   Early liftoff/climb performance may allow the aircraft  to cross well above the obstacle(s);  •   If the obstacle(s) cannot be visually acquired during  departure, preflight planning should take into account  what turns or other maneuver(s) may be necessary  immediately after takeoff to avoid the obstruction(s).  

These obstacles are especially critical to aircraft that do not  lift off until close to the DER or which climb at the minimum  rate. [Figure 1-18]  

# One-Engine-Inoperative (OEI) Takeoff Obstacle  Clearance Requirements  

Large and turbine-powered, multiengine transport  category airplanes and commuter category airplanes  operated under Part 121 or Part 135 have additional takeoff  obstacle clearance requirements beyond the scope of the  IFR departure procedure requirements addressed by TERPS.  

Part 25 transport category and Part 23 commuter category  airplane certification rules define the one-engine­ inoperative (OEI) takeoff flight path, which is normally  constructed from a series of segments beginning from 35  feet above the runway surface at the end of the OEI takeoff  distance and ending at a minimum height of 1,500 feet  above the runway elevation. However, the OEI net takeoff  flight path assessment may continue above 1,500 feet if  necessary to ensure obstacle clearance.  

The actual, or gross, OEI flight path represents the vertical  OEI climb profile that the aircraft has been demonstrated  capable of achieving using takeoff procedures developed  for line operations based on the aircraft’s weight,  configuration, and environmental conditions at the time  of takeoff. The OEI net takeoff flight path represents the  actual OEI takeoff flight path that has been degraded by  an amount specified by the certification rules to provide  a safety margin for expected variations under operational  conditions. Subpart I of Part 121 and Part 135 require that  the OEI net takeoff flight path be at least 35 feet above  obstacles that are located within the prescribed lateral  distance either side of the flight path The actual obstacle  clearance capability, under optimum conditions after  experiencing an engine failure on takeoff, is equal to the  difference between gross and net flight path, plus the  additional 35 feet. [Figure 1-19]  

Advisory Circular (AC) 120-91, Airport Obstacle Analysis,  provides guidance and acceptable criteria for use in  determining the safe lateral clearance from obstacles,  when developing takeoff and initial climb out airport  obstacle analyses and engine out obstacle avoidance  procedures to comply with the intent of these regulatory  requirements. Pilots departing an airport under IFR and  operating under Part 121 or 135 are required by 14 CFR  91.175(f )(4) to use an engine-inoperative takeoff obstacle  clearance or avoidance procedure that assures compliance  with the obstacle clearance requirements (subpart I)  of those rules. The assessment of OEI takeoff obstacle  clearance is separate and independent of the IFR departure  procedure and associated all-engines-operating climb  gradient requirements. While the Part 91 operating rules  governing large, commuter, and turbine-powered aircraft  do not require the use of an OEI takeoff obstacle clearance  or avoidance procedure, such use is encouraged for Part  91 operators of these aircraft.  

Unlike TERPS, which assesses obstacle clearance beginning  at the DER, the OEI net takeoff flight path obstacle  assessment begins at the point where the aircraft reaches  35 feet above the runway at the end of the OEI takeoff  distance. Therefore, the OEI net takeoff flight path  assessment may begin before the DER allowing for the  use of a portion of the runway for the OEI climb. The OEI  net takeoff flight path obstacle clearance assessment must  also account for clearance of the low, close-in obstacles  that are noted on the IFR departure procedure, but are not  necessarily cleared when complying with the TERPS-based  IFR climb gradient.  

The OEI net takeoff flight path is unique for each aircraft  type and is assessed on each takeoff for the required  obstacle clearance directly against those obstacles located  beneath the OEI flight track and within the prescribed  lateral distance from the flight path centerline. TERPS, on  the other hand, provides a required climb gradient that  represents a surface that the aircraft’s all-engines-operating  climb profile must remain above throughout the IFR  climb until reaching the en route environment. These two  methods of assessing obstacle clearance are necessarily  quite different. TERPS is used by the procedure designer  

![](images/b652f3a3abe801b9250c9a416614903ea07f454618b91e671faf75e2b232859d.jpg)  
Figure 1-20.  Airport/runway analysis example.  

to determine a lateral path that is usable by a wide variety  of aircraft types, and establishes a clearance plane that  aircraft must be able to stay above to fly the procedure. A  Part 25 transport category and Part 23 commuter category  aircraft’s OEI takeoff flight path is established by or on  behalf of the operator for a particular aircraft type and then  limit weights are determined that assure clearance of any  obstacles under that flight path (or within the prescribed  lateral distance from the flight path centerline).  

It may be necessary for pilots and operators of these  categories of aircraft to use the services of an aircraft  performance engineer or airport/runway analysis service  provider as means of compliance with the requirements  of Part 121 subpart I, or Part 135 subpart I concerning  OEI net takeoff flight obstacle clearance and takeoff field  length requirements. [Figure 1-20] Airport/runway analysis  involves the complex, usually computerized, computations  of aircraft performance, using extensive airport/obstacle  databases and terrain information. This yields maximum  allowable takeoff and landing weights for particular  aircraft/engine configurations for a specific airport, runway,  and range of temperatures. The computations also consider  flap settings, various aircraft characteristics, runway  conditions, obstacle clearance, and weather conditions.  Obstacle data also is available from these service providers  for operators who desire to perform their own analysis  using the OEI climb performance and flight path data  furnished in the Airplane Flight Manual or when using an  aircraft electronic performance program supplied by the  manufacturer or other service provider.  

Airport/runway analysis is typically based on the  assumption that the pilot will fly a straight-out departure  following an engine failure on takeoff. However, when a  straight-out departure is not practical or recommended,  a special OEI turn procedure can be developed for each  applicable runway. This OEI turn procedure may follow  the path of a published IFR departure procedure or it  may follow an independent path designed to avoid  

![](images/06e9880e65e9bef331b609ef1471b392dfe5b2a1b3542f41514c2cefcfcfce4b.jpg)  
Figure 1-21.  Graphic ODP/booklet front matter.  

otherwise onerous obstacles and thereby maximize the  allowable takeoff weight and payload. Graphic depiction  of the OEI procedure is often available to give the pilot a  pictorial representation of the special OEI procedure. An  engine failure during takeoff is a non-normal condition;  therefore, the actions taken by the pilot including the use  of an OEI turn procedure takes precedence over noise  abatement, air traffic, SIDs, DPs, and other normal operating  considerations.  

It must be understood that the airport/runway analysis  assesses obstacle clearance using the OEI net takeoff flight  path data provided in the Airplane Flight Manual and the  selected lateral obstacle assessment area. A takeoff weight  limit provided on the analysis does not necessarily ensure  compliance with the all-engines-operating climb gradient  published on an IFR departure procedure even if the  track of the OEI special procedure and the IFR departure  procedure are identical.  

# Categories of Departure Procedures  

There are two types of DPs:  those developed to assist  pilots in obstruction avoidance, known as ODPs, printed  either textually or graphically, and those developed  to communicate ATC clearances, SIDs, always printed  graphically.  

# Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs)  

The term ODP is used to define procedures that simply  provide obstacle clearance. ODPs are only used for  obstruction clearance and do not include ATC-related  climb requirements. In fact, the primary emphasis of ODP  design is to use the least restrictive route of flight to the  en route structure or to facilitate a climb to an altitude  that allows random (diverse) IFR flight, while attempting  to accommodate typical departure routes.  

An ODP must be developed when obstructions penetrate  the 40:1 departure OCS, as described in FAA Order 8260.3.  Only one ODP will be established for a particular runway.  This is considered the default IFR departure procedure for  a given runway and is intended for pilot awareness and  use in the absence of ATC radar vectors or SID assignment.  Text is not published to allow an option to use a SID or  alternate maneuver assigned by ATC (e.g., “Climb heading  330 to 1200 before turning or use Manchester Departure”  or “Turn right, climb direct ABC very high frequency (VHF)  omnidirectional range (VOR) or as assigned by ATC.”). ODPs  are textual in nature. However, due to the complex nature  of some procedures, a visual presentation may be necessary  for clarification and understanding. If the ODP is charted  graphically, the chart itself includes the word “Obstacle” in  parentheses in the title. Additionally, all newly-developed  All ODPs are listed in the front of the Aeronautical  Information Services approach chart booklets under  the heading Takeoff Minimums and Obstacle Departure  Procedures. Each procedure is listed in alphabetical order  by city and state. The ODP listing in the front of the booklet  includes a reference to the graphic chart located in the main  body of the booklet if one exists. [Figure 1-21]  

# ODP Flight Planning Considerations  

ODPs are not assigned by ATC unless absolutely necessary  to achieve aircraft separation. It is the pilot’s responsibility  to determine if there is an ODP published for that airport. If a  Part 91 pilot is not given a clearance containing an ODP, SID,  or radar vectors and an ODP exists, compliance with such  a procedure is the pilot’s choice. A graphic ODP may also  be filed in an instrument flight plan by using the computer  code included in the procedure title. As a technique, the  pilot may enter “will depart (airport) (runway) via textual   $\mathsf{O D P^{\prime\prime}}$  in the remarks section of the flight plan. Providing  this information to the controller clarifies the intentions  of the pilot and helps prevent a potential pilot/controller  misunderstanding. If the ODP is not included in the pilot’s  clearance, the pilot should inform ATC when an ODP is  used for departure from a runway so that ATC can ensure  appropriate traffic separation.  

During planning, pilots need to determine whether or  not the departure airport has an ODP. Remember, an ODP  can only be established at an airport that has instrument  approach procedures (IAPs). An ODP may drastically affect  the initial part of the flight plan. Pilots may have to depart  at a higher than normal climb rate, or depart in a direction  opposite the intended heading and maintain that for a  period of time, any of which would require an alteration in  the flight plan and initial headings. Considering the forecast  weather, departure runways, and existing ODP, plan the  flight route, climb performance, and fuel burn accordingly  to compensate for the departure procedure.  

Additionally, when close-in obstacles are noted in the  Takeoff Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures  section, it may require the pilot to take action to avoid these  obstacles. Consideration must be given to decreased climb  performance from an inoperative engine or to the amount  of runway used for takeoff. Aircraft requiring a short takeoff  roll on a long runway may have little concern. On the other  hand, airplanes that use most of the available runway for  takeoff may not have the standard ROC when climbing at  the normal 200 ft/NM.  

Another factor to consider is the possibility of an

engine failure during takeoff and departure. During the  preflight planning, use the aircraft performance charts  to determine if the aircraft can still maintain the required  climb performance. For high performance aircraft, an  engine failure may not impact the ability to maintain the  prescribed climb gradients. Aircraft that are performance  limited may have diminished capability and may be unable  to maintain altitude, let alone complete a climb to altitude.  Based on the performance expectations for the aircraft,  construct an emergency plan of action that includes  emergency checklists and the actions to take to ensure  safety in this situation.  

# Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs)  

A SID is an ATC-requested and developed departure route,  typically used in busy terminal areas. It is designed at the  request of ATC in order to increase capacity of terminal  airspace, effectively control the flow of traffic with minimal  communication, and reduce environmental impact  through noise abatement procedures.  

While obstacle protection is always considered in SID  routing, the primary goal is to reduce ATC/pilot workload  while providing seamless transitions to the en route  structure. ATC clearance must be received prior to flying  a SID. SIDs also provide additional benefits to both the  airspace capacity and the airspace users by reducing  radio congestion, allowing more efficient airspace use,  and simplifying departure clearances. All of the benefits  combine to provide effective, efficient terminal operations,  thereby increasing the overall capacity of the NAS.  

If you cannot comply with a SID, if you do not possess the  charted SID procedure, or if you simply do not wish to  use SIDs, include the statement “NO SIDs” in the remarks  section of your flight plan. Doing so notifies ATC that they  cannot issue you a clearance containing a SID, but instead  will clear you via your filed route to the extent possible,  or via a Preferential Departure Route (PDR). It should be  noted that SID usage not only decreases clearance delivery  time, but also greatly simplifies your departure, easing you  into the IFR structure at a desirable location and decreases  your flight management load. While you are not required  to depart using a SID, it may be more difficult to receive  an “as filed” clearance when departing busy airports that  frequently use SID routing.  

SIDs are always charted graphically and are located in the  TPP after the last approach chart for an airport. The SID  may be one or two pages in length, depending on the size  of the graphic and the amount of space required for the  departure description. Each chart depicts the departure  route, navigational fixes, transition routes, and required  altitudes. The departure description outlines the particular  procedure for each runway. [Figure 1-22]  

# Transition Routes  

Charted transition routes allow pilots to transition from the  end of the basic SID to a location in the en route structure.  Typically, transition routes fan out in various directions  from the end of the basic SID to allow pilots to choose  the transition route that takes them in the direction of  intended departure. A transition route includes a course,  a minimum altitude, and distances between fixes on the  route. When filing a SID for a specific transition route,  include the transition in the flight plan, using the correct  departure and transition code. ATC also assigns transition  routes as a means of putting the flight on course to the  destination. In any case, the pilot must receive an ATC  clearance for the departure and the associated transition,  and the clearance from ATC will include both the departure  name and transition (e.g., Joe Pool Nine Departure, College  Station Transition). [Figure 1-23]  

The SID is designed to allow the pilot to provide his or  her own navigation with minimal radio communication.  This type of procedure usually contains an initial set of  departure instructions followed by one or more transition  routes. A SID may include an initial segment requiring  radar vectors to help the flight join the procedure, but the  majority of the navigation remains the pilot’s responsibility.  [Figure 1-24]  

A radar SID usually requires ATC to provide radar vectors  from just after takeoff (ROC is based on a climb to 400 feet  above the DER elevation before making the initial turn)  until reaching the assigned route or a fix depicted on the  SID chart. Radar SIDs do not include departure routes or  transition routes because independent pilot navigation  is not involved. The procedure sets forth an initial set of  departure instructions that typically include an initial  heading and altitude. ATC must have radar contact with  the aircraft to be able to provide vectors. ATC expects  you to immediately comply with radar vectors, and they  expect you to notify them if you are unable to fulfill their  request. ATC also expects you to make contact immediately  if an instruction causes you to compromise safety due to  obstructions or traffic.  

It is prudent to review radar SID charts prior to use because  this type of procedure often includes nonstandard  lost communication procedures. If you were to lose  radio contact while being vectored by ATC, you would  be expected to comply with the lost communication  procedure as outlined on the chart, not necessarily those  procedures outlined in the AIM. [Figure 1-25]

# SID Flight Planning Considerations  

Take into consideration the departure paths included in  the SIDs, and determine if you can use a standardized  departure procedure. You have the opportunity to choose  the SID that best suits your flight plan. During the flight  planning phase, you can investigate each departure,  and determine which procedure allows you to depart  the airport in the direction of your intended flight. Also  consider how a climb gradient to a specific altitude affects  the climb time and fuel burn portions of the flight plan.  Notes giving procedural requirements are listed on the  graphic portion of a departure procedure, and they are  mandatory in nature. [Figure 1-26] Mandatory procedural  notes may include:  

•  Aircraft equipment requirements (DME, ADF, etc.)  •  ATC equipment in operation (radar)  •  Minimum climb requirements  •  Restrictions for specific types of aircraft (turbojet only)  •  Limited use to certain destinations  

Cautionary statements may also be included on the  procedure to notify you of specific activity, but these are  strictly advisory. [Figure 1-26] If you are unable to comply  with a specific requirement, you must not file the procedure  as part of your flight plan. If ATC assigns you a SID, you may  

![](images/ecf393b62236e55558c35d07a0c1a15a0d16ea7a6d0d1190c7d16470e1b4f38f.jpg)

need to quickly recalculate your all-engines-operating  performance numbers. If you cannot comply with the  climb gradient in the SID, you should not accept a clearance  for that SID and furthermore, you must not accept the  procedure if ATC assigns it.  

A clearance for a SID which contains published altitude  restrictions may be issued using the phraseology “climb  via.” Climb via is an abbreviated clearance that requires  compliance with the procedure lateral path, associated  speed and altitude restrictions along the cleared route or  procedure. Expanded procedures for "Climb via" can be  found in the AIM.  

ATC can assign SIDs or radar vectors as necessary for traffic  management and convenience. To fly a SID, you must  receive approval to do so in a clearance. In order to accept  a clearance that includes a SID, you must have the charted  SID procedure  in your possession at the time of departure.  It is your responsibility as pilot in command to accept or  reject the issuance of a SID by ATC. You must accept or  reject the clearance based on:  

•   The ability to comply with the required performance.  •   The ability to navigate to the degree of accuracy  required for the procedure.  

•   Possession of the charted SID procedure.  •   Personal understanding of the SID in its entirety.  

When you accept a clearance to depart using a SID or radar  vectors, ATC is responsible for traffic separation. When  departing with a SID, ATC expects you to fly the procedure as  charted because the procedure design considers obstacle  clearance. It is also expected that you will remain vigilant  in scanning for traffic when departing in visual conditions.  Furthermore, it is your responsibility to notify ATC if your  clearance would endanger your safety or the safety of others.  DPs are also categorized by equipment requirements  as follows:  

•   Non-RNAV DP—established for aircraft equipped  with conventional avionics using ground-based  NAVAIDs.These DPs may also be designed using dead  reckoning navigation. Some flight management  systems (FMS) are certified to fly a non-RNAV DP  if the FMS unit accepts inputs from conventional  avionics sources, such as DME, VOR, and localizer  (LOC). These inputs include radio tuning and may  

be applied to a navigation solution one at a time or  in combination. Some FMS provide for the detection  and isolation of faulty navigation information.  

•   RNAV DP—established for aircraft equipped with  RNAV avionics (e.g., GPS, VOR/DME, DME/DME).  Automated vertical navigation is not required,  and all RNAV procedures not requiring GPS must  be annotated with the note:  “RADAR REQUIRED.”  Prior to using TSO-C129 GPS equipment for RNAV  departures, approach receiver autonomous integrity  monitoring (RAIM) availability should be checked for  that location.  

•   Radar DP—radar may be used for navigation  guidance for SID design. Radar SIDs are established  when ATC has a need to vector aircraft on departure  to a particular ATS Route, NAVAID, or fix. A fix may  be a ground-based NAVAID, a waypoint, or defined  by reference to one or more radio NAVAIDs. Not all  fixes are waypoints since a fix could be a VOR or VOR/  DME, but all waypoints are fixes. Radar vectors may  also be used to join conventional or RNAV navigation  SIDs. SIDs requiring radar vectors must be annotated  “RADAR REQUIRED.”  

# Area Navigation (RNAV) Departures  

Historically, departure procedures were built around  existing ground-based technology and were typically  designed to accommodate lower traffic volumes. Often,  departure and arrival routes use the same NAVAIDs creating  

![](images/7ea1934011f0bc83c905eef21f80078fddb6a105446b60873a7a760af6ebc16b.jpg)

![](images/c5975200ca1585c26866a816fde60d20953ce6b31e21a23458b6a7093f24c7e4.jpg)  

interdependent, capacity diminishing routes. RNAV is a  method of navigation that permits aircraft operation on  any desired flight path within the coverage of ground- or  spaced- based NAVAIDs or within the limits of the capability  of self-contained aids or a combination of these. In the  future, there will be an increased dependence on the  use of RNAV in lieu of routes defined by ground-based  NAVAIDs. As a part of the evolving RNAV structure, the  FAA has developed departure procedures for pilots flying  aircraft equipped with some type of RNAV technology.  RNAV allows for the creation of new departure routes  that are independent of present fixes and NAVAIDs. RNAV  routing is part of the National Airspace Redesign (NAR) and  is expected to reduce complexity and increase efficiency  of terminal airspace.  

When new RNAV departure procedures are designed,  they will require minimal vectoring and communications  between pilots and ATC. Usually, each departure procedure  includes position, time, and altitude, which increase  the ability to predict what the pilot will actually do.  RNAV departure procedures have the ability to increase  the capacity of terminal airspace by increasing on- time departures, airspace utilization, and improved  predictability.  

All public RNAV SIDs and graphic ODPs are RNAV 1. These  procedures generally start with an initial RNAV or heading  leg near the departure end runway. In addition, these  procedures require system performance currently met  by GPS, DME/DME/Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) RNAV  systems that satisfy the criteria discussed in AC 90-100, U.S.  Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations.  RNAV departures are identifiable by the inclusion of the  term RNAV in the title of the departure. From a required  navigation performance (RNP) standpoint, RNAV departure  routes are designed with 1 or 2 NM performance standards  as listed below. This means you as the pilot and your aircraft  equipment must be able to maintain the aircraft within 1  or 2 NM either side of route centerline. [Figure 1-27]  

•   RNAV 1 procedures require that the aircraft’s total  system error remain bounded by   $\pm1$   NM for 95  percent of the total flight time.  

•   RNAV 2 requires a total system error of not more  than 2 NM for 95 percent of the total flight time.  

RNP is RNAV with on-board monitoring and alerting; RNP is  also a statement of navigation performance necessary for  operation within defined airspace. RNP 1 (in-lieu-of RNAV  1) is used when a DP that contains a constant radius to a  fix (RF) leg or when surveillance (radar) monitoring is not  desired for when DME/DME/IRU is used. These procedures  are annotated with a standard note: “RNP 1.”  

If unable to comply with the requirements of an RNAV  or RNP procedure, pilots need to advise ATC as soon as  possible. For example,  $"\mathsf{N}1234$  , failure of GPS system,  unable RNAV, request amended clearance.” Pilots are not  authorized to fly a published RNAV or RNP procedure unless  it is retrievable by the procedure name from the navigation  database and conforms to the charted procedure. No other  modification of database waypoints or creation of user-  defined waypoints on published RNAV or RNP procedures  is permitted, except to change altitude and/or airspeed  waypoint constraints to comply with an ATC clearance/  instruction, or to insert a waypoint along the published  route to assist in complying with an ATC instruction. For  example, “Climb via the WILIT departure except cross 30  north of CHUCK at/ or above FL 210.” This is limited only  to systems that allow along track waypoint construction.  

Pilots of aircraft utilizing DME/DME for primary navigation  updating should ensure any required DME stations are in  service as determined by NOTAM, ATIS, or ATC advisory.  DME/DME navigation system updating may require specific  DME facilities to meet performance standards. Based on  DME availability evaluations at the time of publication,  current DME coverage is not sufficient to support DME/DME  RNAV operations everywhere without IRU augmentation or  use of GPS. [Figure 1-28] DP chart notes may also include  operational information for certain types of equipment,  systems, and performance requirements, in addition to  the type of RNAV departure procedure.  

While operating on RNAV segments, pilots are encouraged  to use the flight director in lateral navigation mode. RNAV  terminal procedures may be amended by ATC issuing radar  vectors and/or clearances direct to a waypoint. Pilots should  avoid premature manual deletion of waypoints from their  active “legs” page to allow for rejoining procedures. While  operating on RNAV segments, pilots operating /R aircraft  should adhere to any flight manual limitation or operating  procedure required to maintain the RNP value specified for  the procedure. In 2008, the FAA implemented the use of  en route host automation ICAO flight plan (FP) processing  for requesting assignment of RNAV SID, Standard Terminal  Arrivals (STARs), or RNAV routes U.S. domestic airspace.  This is part of a risk reduction strategy for introduction of  the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system in  October 2008. ERAM also will use ICAO FP processing and as  a result aircrews should be aware that as the FAA updates to  ERAM the standard FAA flight plan equipment suffix codes  will change to the ICAO flight plan equipment suffix codes.  

For procedures requiring GPS and/or aircraft approvals  requiring GPS, if the navigation system does not  automatically alert the flight crew of a loss of GPS, aircraft  operators must develop procedures to verify correct GPS

operation. If not equipped with GPS, or for multi-sensor  systems with GPS that do not alert upon loss of GPS, aircraft  must be capable of navigation system updating using DME/  DME or DME/DME/ IRU for type 1 and 2 procedures. AC 90­ 100 may be used as operational guidance for RNAV ODPs.  Pilots of FMS-equipped aircraft who are assigned an RNAV  DP procedure and subsequently receive a change of runway,  transition, or procedure, must verify that the appropriate  changes are loaded and available for navigation. [Figures  1-29 and 1-30]  

Additionally, new waypoint symbols are used in conjunction  with RNAV charts. There are two types of waypoints  currently in use:  fly-by (FB) and fly-over (FO). A FB waypoint  typically is used in a position at which a change in the course  of procedure occurs. Charts represent them with four- pointed stars. This type of waypoint is designed to allow  you to anticipate and begin your turn prior to reaching the  waypoint, thus providing smoother transitions. Conversely,  RNAV charts show a FO waypoint as a four-pointed star  enclosed in a circle. This type of waypoint is used to denote  a missed approach point, a missed approach holding  point, or other specific points in space that must be flown  over. [Figure 1-31] Pilots should not change any database  waypoint type from a FB to FO, or vice versa.  

There are specific requirements;  however, that must be met  before using RNAV procedures. Every RNAV departure chart  lists general notes and may include specific equipment and  performance requirements, as well as the type of RNAV  departure procedure in the chart plan view. New aircraft  equipment suffix codes are used to denote capabilities for  advanced RNAV navigation for flight plan filing purposes.  [Figure 1-32]  

# SID Altitudes  

SID altitudes can be charted in four different ways. The  first are mandatory altitudes, the second, minimum  altitudes, the third, maximum altitudes and the fourth is a  combination of minimum and maximum altitudes or also  referred to as block altitudes. Below are examples of how  each will be shown on a SID chart.  

•  Mandatory altitudes  – 5500  •  Minimum altitudes – 2300  •  Maximum altitudes – 3300  

![](images/cafb3fb5ea1da14ecac847882edab6b8695beaabece05dbbd6370bebdf196aed.jpg)  
Figure 1-32.  Operation requirements for RNAV.  

•  Combination of minimum and maximum – 7000  

Some SIDs may still have  $\prime\prime(\mathsf{A T C})^{\prime\prime}$  adjacent to a crossing  altitude as shown in Figure 1-33 which implies that the  crossing altitude is there to support an ATC requirement.  A new charting standard has begun a process to remove,  over a period of time, the ATC annotation. The Cowboy  Four Departure (RNAV) shown in Figure 1-34 depicts the  new charting standard without ATC annotations. When  necessary, ATC may amend or delete SID crossing altitude  restrictions; when doing so, ATC assumes responsibility  for obstacle clearance until the aircraft is re-established  laterally and vertically on the published SID route.  

# Pilot Responsibility for Use of RNAV Departures  

RNAV usage brings with it multitudes of complications  as it is being implemented. It takes time to transition,  to disseminate information, and to educate current  and potential users. As a current pilot using the NAS,  you need to have a clear understanding of the aircraft  equipment requirements for operating in a given RNP  environment. You must understand the type of navigation  system installed in your aircraft, and furthermore, you  must know how your system operates to ensure that  you can comply with all RNAV requirements. Operational  information should be included in your AFM or its  supplements. Additional information concerning how  to use your equipment to its fullest capacity, including  “how to” training, may be gathered from your avionics  manufacturer. If you are in doubt about the operation of  your avionics system and its ability to comply with RNAV  requirements, contact the FAA directly through your local  Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). RNAV departure  procedures are being developed at a rapid pace to provide  RNAV capabilities at all airports. With every chart revision  cycle, new RNAV departures are being added for small  and large airports. These departures are flown in the same  manner as traditional navigation-based departures; pilots  are provided headings, altitudes, navigation waypoint,  and departure descriptions. RNAV SIDs are found in the  TPP with traditional departure procedures.  

![](images/8022fedc3c8053ce435cd0ac7b316756ec7c39e119236963f21126c7e39c9b7e.jpg)  
Figure 1-33.  Crossing altitude is there to support an ATC requirement.  

# Radar Departures  

A radar departure is another option for departing an airport  on an IFR flight. You might receive a radar departure if the  airport does not have an established departure procedure,  if you are unable to comply with a departure procedure, or  if you request “No SIDs” as a part of your flight plan. Expect  ATC to issue an initial departure heading if you are being  radar vectored after takeoff; however, do not expect to  be given a purpose for the specific vector heading. Rest  assured that the controller knows your flight route and will  vector you into position. By nature of the departure type,  once you are issued your clearance, the responsibility for  coordination of your flight rests with ATC, including the  tower controller and, after handoff, the departure controller  who will remain with you until you are released on course  and allowed to “resume own navigation.”  

For all practical purposes, a radar departure is the easiest  type of departure to use. It is also a good alternative to a  published departure procedure, particularly when none of  the available departure procedures are conducive to your  flight route. However, it is advisable to always maintain a  detailed awareness of your location while you are being  radar vectored by ATC. If for some reason radar contact is  lost, you will be asked to provide position reports in order  for ATC to monitor your flight progress. Also, ATC may  release you to “resume own navigation” after vectoring you  off course momentarily for a variety of reasons, including  weather or traffic.  

Upon initial contact, state your aircraft or flight number,  the altitude you are climbing through, and the altitude  to which you are climbing. The controller will verify that  your reported altitude matches that emitted by your  transponder. If your altitude does not match, or if you  do not have Mode C capabilities, you will be continually  required to report your position and altitude for ATC.  

The controller is not required to provide terrain and  obstacle clearance just because ATC has radar contact  with your aircraft. It remains your responsibility until the  controller begins to provide navigational guidance in  the form of radar vectors. Once radar vectors are given,  you are expected to promptly comply with headings and  altitudes as assigned. Question any assigned heading if you  believe it to be incorrect or if it would cause a violation of  a regulation, then advise ATC immediately and obtain a  revised clearance.

# Diverse Vector Area  

ATC may establish a minimum vectoring altitude (MVA)  around certain airports. This altitude, based on terrain and  obstruction clearance, provides controllers with minimum  altitudes to vector aircraft in and around a particular  location. However, at times, it may be necessary to vector  aircraft below this altitude to assist in the efficient flow of  departing traffic. For this reason, an airport may have an  established Diverse Vector Area (DVA). This DVA may be  established below the MVA or Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)  in a radar environment at the request of Air Traffic. This  type of DP meets the TERPs criteria for diverse departures,  obstacles and terrain avoidance in which random radar  vectors below the MVA/MIA may be issued to departing  traffic.  

The existence of a DVA will be noted in the Takeoff  Minimums and Obstacle Departure Procedures section of  the U.S. Terminal Procedure Publication (TPP). The Takeoff  Departure procedure will be listed first, followed by any  applicable DVA. Pilots should be aware that Air Traffic  facilities may utilize a climb gradient greater than the  standard 200 ft/NM within a DVA. This information will be  identified in the DVA text for pilot evaluation against the  aircraft's performance. Pilots should note that the DVA  has been assessed for departures which do not follow a  specified ground track, but will remain within the specified  area. ATC may also vector an aircraft off a previously  assigned DP. In all cases, the minimum 200 ft/NM climb  gradient is assumed unless a higher is specified on the  departure, and obstacle clearance is not provided by ATC  until the controller begins to provide navigational guidance  (vectors). Lastly, pilots should understand ATC instructions  take precedence over an ODP [Figure 1-35].  

# Visual Climb Over Airport (VCOA)  

A visual climb over airport (VCOA) is a departure option for  an IFR aircraft, operating in VMC equal to or greater than the  specified visibility and ceiling, to visually conduct climbing  turns over the airport to the published "climb-to" altitude  from which to proceed with the instrument portion  of the  departure. A VCOA is a departure option developed when  obstacles farther than 3 SM from the airport require a CG  of more than 200 ft/NM.  

These procedures are published in the Take-Off  Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure Procedures section  of the TPP. [Figure 1-36] Prior to departure, pilots are  required to notify ATC when executing the VCOA.  

# Noise Abatement Procedures  

As the aviation industry continues to grow and air traffic  increases, so does the population of people and businesses  around airports. As a result, noise abatement procedures  have become commonplace at most of the nation’s airports.  14 CFR Part 150 specifies the responsibilities of the FAA to  investigate the recommendations of the airport operator in  a noise compatibility program and approve or disapprove  the noise abatement suggestions. This is a crucial step in  ensuring that the airport is not unduly inhibited by noise  requirements and that air traffic workload and efficiency  are not significantly impacted, all while considering the  noise problems addressed by the surrounding community.  

While most DPs are designed for obstacle clearance and  workload reduction, there are some SIDs that are developed  solely to comply with noise abatement requirements.  Portland International Jetport is an example of an airport  where a SID was created strictly for noise abatement  purposes as noted in the DP. [Figure 1-36] Typically, noise  restrictions are incorporated into the main body of the  SID. These types of restrictions require higher departure  altitudes, larger climb gradients, reduced airspeeds, and  turns to avoid specific areas. Noise restrictions may also  be evident during a radar departure. ATC may require you  to turn away from your intended course or vector you  around a particular area. While these restrictions may seem  burdensome, it is important to remember that it is your  duty to comply with written and spoken requests from ATC.  

Additionally, when required, departure instructions specify  the actual heading to be flown after takeoff, as is the case in  Figure 1-37 under the departure route description, “Climb  via heading 112 degrees...” Some existing procedures specify,  “Climb runway heading.”Over time, both of these departure  instructions will be updated to read, “Climb heading 112  degrees....” Runway heading is the magnetic direction that  corresponds with the runway centerline extended (charted  on the airport diagram), not the numbers painted on the  runway. Pilots cleared to “fly or maintain runway heading”  are expected to fly or maintain the published heading that  corresponds with the extended centerline of the departure  runway (until otherwise instructed by ATC), and are not to  apply drift correction (e.g., RWY 11, actual magnetic heading  of the runway centerline 112.2 degrees, “fly heading 112  degrees”). In the event of parallel departures, this prevents  a loss of separation caused by only one aircraft applying a  wind drift.  

An important consideration to make during your flight  planning is whether or not you are able to fly your chosen  departure procedure as charted.  

# DP Responsibilities  

Responsibility for the safe execution of DPs rests on the  shoulders of both ATC and the pilot. Without the interest  and attention of both parties, the IFR system cannot work  in harmony, and achievement of safety is impossible.  

ATC, in all forms, is responsible for issuing clearances  appropriate to the operations being conducted, assigning  altitudes for IFR flight above the minimum IFR altitudes for  a specific area of controlled airspace, ensuring the pilot has  acknowledged the clearance or instructions, and ensuring  the correct read back of instructions. Specifically related to  departures, ATC is responsible for specifying the direction  of takeoff or initial heading when necessary, obtaining pilot  concurrence that the procedure complies with local traffic  patterns, terrain, and obstruction clearance, and including  DP as part of the ATC clearance when pilot compliance for  separation is necessary.  

The pilot has a number of responsibilities when simply  operating in conjunction with ATC or when using DPs under  an IFR clearance:  

•   Acknowledge receipt and understanding of an ATC  clearance.  •   Read back any part of a clearance that contains “hold  short” instructions.  •   Request clarification of clearances.  •   Request an amendment to a clearance if it is  unacceptable from a safety perspective.  •   Promptly comply with ATC requests. Advise ATC  immediately if unable to comply with a clearance.  •   You are required to contact ATC if you are unable to  comply with all-engines-operating climb gradients  and climb rates. It is also expected that you are  capable of maintaining the climb gradient outlined  in either a standard or non-standard DP. If you  cannot maintain a standard climb gradient or the  climb gradient specified in an ODP, you must wait  until you can depart under VMC.  

When planning for a departure, pilots should:  

•   Consider the type of terrain and other obstructions in  the vicinity of the airport.  •   Determine if obstacle clearance can be maintained  visually, or if they need to make use of a DP.  

•   Determine if an ODP or SID is available for the  departure airport.  •   Determine what actions allow for a safe departure  out of an airport that does not have any type of  affiliated DPs.  

By simply complying with DPs in their entirety as published,  obstacle clearance is guaranteed. Depending on the type  of departure used, responsibility for terrain clearance  and traffic separation may be shared between pilots and  controllers.  

# Departures From Tower-Controlled Airports  

Departing from a tower-controlled airport is relatively  simple in comparison to departing from non-towered  airport. Normally you request your IFR clearance through  ground control or clearance delivery. Communication  frequencies for the various controllers are listed on  departure, approach, and airport charts, as well as the  Chart Supplement (CS). At some airports, you may have  the option of receiving a pre-taxi clearance. This program  allows you to call ground control or clearance delivery no  more than 10 minutes prior to beginning taxi operations  and receive your IFR clearance. A pre-departure clearance  (PDC) program that allows pilots to receive a clearance via  data link from a dispatcher or a data link communications  service provider, e.g. ARINC, is available for Part 121 and  135 operators. A clearance is given to the dispatcher, who  i n turn, relays it to the crew, enabling the crew to bypass  communication with clearance delivery, thus reducing  f requency congestion. Once you have received your  clearance, it is your responsibility to comply with the  i nstructions as given, and notify ATC if you are unable to  c omply with the clearance. If you do not understand the  c learance, or if you think that you have missed a portion  of the clearance, contact ATC immediately for clarification.  

# Departures From Airports Without an  Operating Control Tower  

There are hundreds of airports across the United States  t hat operate successfully every day without the benefit of  a control tower. While a tower is certainly beneficial when  departing IFR, most other departures can be made with  f ew challenges. As usual, you must file your flight plan at  l east 30 minutes in advance. During your planning phase,  i nvestigate the departure airport’s method for receiving an  instrument clearance. You can contact the Flight Service  Station (FSS) on the ground by telephone, and they will  request your clearance from ATC. Typically, when a clearance  is given in this manner, the clearance includes a void time.  You must depart the airport before the clearance void time;  if you fail to depart, you must contact ATC by a specified  notification time, which is within 30 minutes of the original  void time. After the clearance void time, your reserved space  within the IFR system is released for other traffic.  

There are several other ways to receive a clearance at a non- towered airport. If you can contact the FSS or ATC on the  radio, you can request your departure clearance. However,  these frequencies are typically congested, and they may  not be able to provide you with a clearance via the radio.  You also can use a Remote Communications Outlet (RCO)  to contact a FSS if one is located nearby. Some airports  have licensed UNICOM operators that can also contact ATC  on your behalf and, in turn, relay your clearance from ATC.  You are also allowed to depart the airport VFR, if conditions  permit, and contact the controlling authority to request  your clearance in the air.  If there is a direct line to the  controlling ATC Facility, the phone number is published  in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility  Directory (A/FD). As technology improves, new methods  for delivery of clearances at non-towered airports are being  created.  

# Ground Communication Outlet  

Ground Communication Outlets (GCO), have been  developed in conjunction with the FAA to provide pilots  flying in and out of non-towered airports with the capability  to contact ATC and AFSS via very high frequency (VHF)  radio to a telephone connection. This lets pilots obtain an  instrument clearance or close a VFR/IFR flight plan. You can  use four key clicks on your VHF radio to contact the nearest  ATC facility and six key clicks to contact the local AFSS, but it  is intended to be used only as a ground operational tool. A  GCO is an unstaffed, remote controlled ground-to-ground  communication facility that is relatively inexpensive to  install and operate. Installations of these types of outlets  are scheduled at instrument airports around the country.  

GCOs are manufactured by different companies including  ARINC and AVTECH, each with different operating  characteristics but with the ability to accomplish the same  goal. This latest technology has proven to be an incredibly  useful tool for communicating with the appropriate  authorities when departing IFR from a non-towered airport.  The GCO should help relieve the need to use the telephone  to call ATC and the need to depart into marginal conditions  just to achieve radio contact. GCO information is listed on  airport charts and instrument approach charts with other  communications frequencies. Signs may also be located on  an airport to notify you of the frequency and proper usage.  

# See and Avoid Techniques  

Meteorological conditions permitting, you are required  to use “see and avoid” techniques to avoid traffic, terrain,  and other obstacles. To avoid obstacles during a departure,  the takeoff minimums may include a non-standard ceiling  and visibility minimum. These are given to pilots so they  can depart an airport without being able to meet the  established climb gradient. Instead, they must see and  avoid obstacles in the departure path. In these situations,  ATC provides radar traffic information for radar-identified  aircraft outside controlled airspace, workload permitting,  and safety alerts to pilots believed to be within an unsafe  proximity to obstacles or aircraft.  

# VFR Departures  

There may be times when you need to fly an IFR flight  plan due to the weather you will encounter at a later time  (or if you simply wish to fly IFR to remain proficient), but  the weather outside is clearly VFR. It may be that you can  depart VFR, but you need to get an IFR clearance shortly  after departing the airport. A VFR departure can be used as  a tool that allows you to get off the ground without having  to wait for a time slot in the IFR system, however, departing  VFR with the intent of receiving an IFR clearance in the air  can also present serious hazards worth considering.  

A VFR departure dramatically changes the takeoff  responsibilities for you and for ATC. Upon receiving  clearance for a VFR departure, you are cleared to depart;  however, you must maintain separation between yourself  and other traffic. You are also responsible for maintaining  terrain and obstruction clearance, as well as remaining in  VFR weather conditions. You cannot fly in IMC without first  receiving your IFR clearance. Likewise, a VFR departure  relieves ATC of these duties and basically requires them  only to provide you with safety alerts as workload permits.  

Maintain VFR until you have obtained your IFR clearance  and have ATC approval to proceed on course in accordance  with your clearance. If you accept this clearance and are  below the minimum IFR altitude for operations in the area,  you accept responsibility for terrain/obstruction clearance  until you reach that altitude.  

# Chapter 2    En Route Operations  

Introduction  

The en route phase of flight is defined as that segment of  flight from the termination point of a departure procedure  to the origination point of an arrival procedure. The  procedures employed in the en route phase of flight are  governed by a set of specific flight standards established  by 14 CFR [Figure 2-1], FAA Order 8260.3, and related  publications. These standards establish courses to be flown,  obstacle clearance criteria, minimum altitudes, navigation  performance, and communications requirements.  

![](images/e4a969a3e53c4acb862a0c7b448083962df689fe08582b975a18f5d232f8aa89.jpg)  

Figure 2-1.  Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14 Aeronautics and Space.  

# En Route Navigation  

En route instrument flight rules (IFR) navigation is evolving  from the ground-based navigational aid (NAVAID) airway  system to a sophisticated satellite and computer-based  system that can generate courses to suit the operational  requirements of almost any flight. The FAA Global  Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides satellite-based  positioning, navigation, and timing services in the United  States to enable performance-based operations for all  phases of flight, to include en route navigation.  

14 CFR Part 91,  §  91.181, is the basis for the course to be  flown. Unless authorized by ATC, to operate an aircraft  within controlled airspace under IFR, pilots must either  fly along the centerline when on a Federal airway or,  on routes other than Federal airways, along the direct  course between NAVAIDs or fixes defining the route. The  regulation allows maneuvering to pass well clear of other  air traffic or, if in visual meteorogical conditions (VMC),  to clear the flightpath both before and during climb or  descent.  

# Airways  

Airway routing occurs along pre-defined pathways called  airways. [Figure 2-2] Airways can be thought of as three-  dimensional highways for aircraft. In most land areas of  the world, aircraft are required to fly airways between the  departure and destination airports. The rules governing  airway routing, Standard Instrument Departures (SID)  and Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR), are published flight  procedures that cover altitude, airspeed, and requirements  for entering and leaving the airway. Most airways are  eight nautical miles (14 kilometers) wide, and the airway  flight levels keep aircraft separated by at least 500 vertical  feet from aircraft on the flight level above and below  when operating under VFR. When operating under IFR,  between the surface and an altitude of Flight Level (FL)  290, no aircraft should come closer vertically than 1,000  feet. Above FL 290, no aircraft should come closer than  2,000 feet except in airspace where Reduced Vertical  Separation Minima (RVSM) can be applied in which case  the vertical separation is reduced to 1,000 feet. Airways  usually intersect at NAVAIDs that designate the allowed  points for changing from one airway to another. Airways  have names consisting of one or more letters followed by  one or more digits (e.g., V484 or UA419).  

The en route airspace structure of the National Airspace  System (NAS) consists of three strata. The first stratum low  

![](images/3cac5a81330e78652f6d1c3d0e79f223f463410f60b0c208eee8a26d8b158def.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.  Airways depicted on an aeronautical chart.  

altitude airways in the United States can be navigated  using NAVAIDs, have names that start with the letter V, and  are called Victor Airways. [Figure 2-3] They cover altitudes  from approximately 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL)  up to, but not including 18,000 feet above mean sea level  (MSL). The second stratum high altitude airways in the  United States all have names that start with the letter J,  and are called Jet Routes. [Figure 2-4] These routes run  from 18,000 feet to 45,000 feet. The third stratum allows  random operations above flight level (FL) 450. The altitude  separating the low and high airway structure varies from  county to country. For example, in Switzerland it is 19,500  feet and 25,000 feet in Egypt.

# Air Route Traffic Control Centers  

The FAA defines an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)  as a facility established to provide air traffic control (ATC)  service to aircraft operating on IFR flight plans within  controlled airspace, principally during the en route phase  of flight. When equipment capabilities and controller  workload permit, certain advisory/assistance services may  be provided to VFR aircraft.  

ARTCCs, usually referred to as Centers, are established  primarily to provide air traffic service to aircraft operating  on IFR flight plans within the controlled airspace, and  principally during the en route phase of flight. There are  

![](images/749b386a7d3628c1f2441edf83eb6fd2a52b87a24ce5eaf8309419e18384713b.jpg)

Figure 2-5.  Air Route Traffic Control Centers.  

21 ARTCC’s in the United States. [Figure 2-5] Any aircraft  operating under IFR within the confines of an ARTCC’s  airspace is controlled by air traffic controllers at the Center.  This includes all sorts of different types of aircraft:  privately  owned single engine aircraft, commuter airlines, military  jets, and commercial airlines.  

The largest component of the NAS is the ARTCC. Each  ARTCC covers thousands of square miles encompassing  all or part of several states. ARTCCs are built to ensure safe  and expeditious air travel. All Centers operate 7-days a  week, 24-hours a day, and employ a combination of several  hundred ATC specialists, electronic technicians, computer  system specialists, environmental support specialists, and  administrative staff. Figure 2-6 is an example of the Boston  ARTCC. The green lines mark the boundaries of the Boston  Center area, and the red lines mark the boundaries of  Military Operations Areas (MOAs), Prohibited, Restricted,  Alert, and Warning Areas.  

# Safe Separation Standards  

The primary means of controlling aircraft is accomplished  by using highly sophisticated computerized radar systems.  In addition, the controller maintains two-way radio  communication with aircraft in his or her sector. In this  way, the specialist ensures that the aircraft are separated  by the following criteria:  

• Laterally—5 miles  • Vertically—  •   1,000 feet (if the aircraft is below FL 290, or  between FL 290 and FL 410 for RVSM compliant  aircraft)   •   2,000 feet (if the aircraft is at FL 290 or above)  

The controllers can accomplish this separation by issuing  instructions to the pilots of the aircraft involved. Altitude  assignments, speed adjustments, and radar vectors are  examples of instructions that might be issued to aircraft.  

En route control is handled by pinpointing aircraft positions  through the use of flight progress strips. These strips are  pieces of printed paper containing pertinent information  extracted from the pilot’s flight plan. These strips are printed  20 minutes prior to an aircraft reaching each Center’s sector.  A flight progress strip tells the controller everything needed  to direct that aircraft. If the flight progress strips of each  aircraft approaching a sector are arranged properly, it is  possible to determine potential conflicts long before the  aircraft are even visible on the Center controller’s display.  In areas where radar coverage is not available, this is the  sole means of separating aircraft.  

![](images/f0c164a9d7518ac1e9eced5fc5349cd9f80417a9fa83618cbaeb646dd7177ad4.jpg)  
Figure 2-6.  Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center.  

The strips, one for each en route point from which the  pilot reports his or her position, are posted on a slotted  board in front of the air traffic controller. [Figure 2-7] At a  glance, he or she is able to see certain vital data:  the type  of aircraft and who is flying it (airline, business, private,  or military pilot), aircraft registration number or flight  number, route, speed, altitude, airway designation, and the  estimated time of arrival (ETA) at destination. As the pilot  calls in the aircraft’s position and time at a predetermined  location, the strips are removed from their slots and filed.  Any change from the original flight plan is noted on the  strips as the flight continues. Thus, from a quick study of  the flight progress board, a controller can assess the overall  traffic situation and can avoid possible conflicts.

Figure 2-8.  Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center.  

Figure 2-8 shows the Fort Worth, Texas Air Route Traffic  Control Center (ZFW) and the geographical area that it  covers. The Center has approximately 350 controllers. Most  are certified and some are in on-the-job training.  

# Sectors  

The airspace controlled by a Center may be further  administratively subdivided into smaller, manageable  pieces of airspace called sectors. A few sectors extend from  the ground up, but most areas are stratified into various  levels to accommodate a wide variety of traffic. Each sector  is staffed by a set of controllers and has a unique radio  frequency that the controller uses to communicate with  the pilots. As aircraft transition from one sector to another,  they are instructed to change to the radio frequency used  by the next sector. Each sector also has secure landline  communications with adjacent sectors, approach controls,  areas, ARTCCs, flight service centers, and military aviation  control facilities.  

![](images/79e81da9a4df58b9b7861a729ba692514c4911869092f9d36c264614772dc46d.jpg)

Figure 2-12.  Ultra high altitude sectors.  

The ARTCC at Fort Worth, Texas is subdivided into sectors  that are categorized as follows:  

•  Eighteen low altitude sectors. [Figure 2-9]  •  Seven intermediate altitude sectors. [Figure 2-10]  •  Sixteen high altitude sectors. [Figure 2-11]  •  One ultra high altitude sector. [Figure 2-12]  

From one to three controllers may work a sector, depending  upon the amount of air traffic. Each controller is assigned  to work the positions within an area of specialization.  Controllers have direct communication with pilots, with  surrounding sectors and Centers, plus the towers and Flight  Service Stations (FSS) under their jurisdiction. Each control  position is equipped with computer input and readout  devices for aircraft flight plan data.  

The Center controllers have many decision support  tools (computer software programs) that provide vital  information to assist the controllers in maintaining safe  separation distances for all aircraft flying through their  sector.  For example, one tool available allows the controller  to display the extended route of any aircraft on the radar  screen called a vector line. This line projects where the  aircraft will be within a specified number of minutes,  assuming the aircraft does not change its course. This is  a helpful tool to determine if aircraft flying intersecting  routes pass safely within the separation standard, or if they  conflict with each other. In addition to vector lines, the  controller can also display a route line for any given aircraft  on his or her radar screen. This tells the controller where  a particular aircraft is in specified number of minutes, as  well as the path the aircraft will fly to get there. Decision  support tools such as these help each controller look ahead  and avoid conflicts.  

# In-flight Requirements and Instructions  

The CFRs require the pilot in command under IFR in  controlled airspace to continuously monitor an appropriate  Center or control frequency. When climbing after takeoff,  an IFR flight is either in contact with a radar-equipped local  departure control or, in some areas, an ARTCC facility. As  a flight transitions to the en route phase, pilots typically  expect a handoff from departure control to a Center  frequency if not already in contact with the Center.  

The FAA National Aeronautical Information Services  publishes en route charts depicting Centers and sector  frequencies. [Figure 2-13] During handoff from one Center  to another, the previous controller assigns a new frequency.  In cases where flights may be out of range, the Center  frequencies on the face of the chart are very helpful. In  Figure 2-13, notice the boundary between Memphis,  Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia Centers, and the remote  sites with discrete very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high  frequency (UHF) for communicating with the appropriate  

![](images/cd0ecf16a7fb54a2ea03c8de35bc87cd6d00d76939d389670395089b56c2b026.jpg)  
Figure 2-13.  Air Route Traffic Control Centers and sector frequencies.  

ARTCC. These Center frequency boxes can be used for  finding the nearest frequency within the aircraft range.  They also can be used for making initial contact with the  Center for clearances. The exact location for the Center  transmitter is not shown, although the frequency box is  placed as close as possible to the known location.  

During the en route phase, as a flight transitions from one  Center facility to the next, a handoff or transfer of control  is required as previously described. The handoff procedure  is similar to the handoff between other radar facilities, such  as departure or approach control. During the handoff,  the controller whose airspace is being vacated issues  instructions that include the name of the facility to contact,  appropriate frequency, and other pertinent remarks.  

Accepting radar vectors from controllers does not relieve  pilots of their responsibility for safety of flight. Pilots must  maintain a safe altitude and keep track of their position,  and it is their obligation to question controllers, request  an amended clearance, or, in an emergency, deviate from  their instructions if they believe that the safety of flight  is in doubt. Keeping track of altitude and position when  climbing, and during all other phases of flight, are basic  elements of situational awareness (SA). Aircraft equipped  with an enhanced ground proximity warning system  (EGPWS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS),  or traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) help  pilots detect and/or correct for potential unsafe proximities  to other aircraft and increases pilot(s) situational awareness.  Regardless of equipment, pilots must always maintain SA  regarding their location and the location of traffic in their  vicinity.  

# High Altitude Area Navigation Routing  

Special high altitude routes allow pilots routing options for  flight within the initial high altitude routing (HAR) Phase  I expansion airspace. Pilots are able to fly user-preferred  routes, referred to as non-restrictive routing (NRR), between  specific fixes described by pitch (entry into) and catch (exit  out of) fixes in the HAR airspace. Pitch points indicate an  end of departure procedures, preferred IFR routings, or  other established routing programs where a flight can  begin a segment of NRR. The catch point indicates where  a flight ends a segment of NRR and joins published arrival  procedures, preferred IFR routing, or other established  routing programs.  

The HAR Phase I expansion airspace is defined as that  airspace at and above FL 350 in fourteen of the western  and southern ARTCCs. The airspace includes Minneapolis  (ZMP), Chicago (ZAU), Kansas City (ZKC), Denver (ZDV),  Salt Lake City (ZLC), Oakland (ZOA), Seattle Centers (ZSE),  Los Angeles (ZLA), Albuquerque (ZAB), Fort Worth (ZFW),  Memphis (ZME), and Houston (ZHU). Jacksonville (ZJX)  and Miami (ZMA) are included for east-west routes only.  To develop a flight plan, select pitch and catch points  which can be found in the Chart Supplement (CS) based  upon your desired route across the Phase I airspace. Filing  requirements to pitch points, and from catch points, remain  unchanged from current procedures. For the portion of the  route between the pitch and catch points, NRR is permitted.  Where pitch points for a specific airport are not identified,  aircraft should file an appropriate departure procedure (DP),  or any other user preferred routing prior to the NRR portion  of their routing. Where catch points for a specific airport  are not identified aircraft should file, after the NRR portion  of their routing, an appropriate arrival procedure or other  user preferred routing to their destination.  

Additionally, information concerning the location and  schedule of special use airspace (SUA) and Air Traffic  Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) can be found at  http://  sua.faa.gov . ATCAA refers to airspace in the high altitude  structure supporting military and other special operations.  Pilots are encouraged to file around these areas when they  are scheduled to be active, thereby avoiding unplanned  reroutes around them.  

In conjunction with the HAR program, area navigation  (RNAV) routes have been established to provide for a  systematic flow of air traffic in specific portions of the en  route flight environment. The designator for these RNAV  routes begin with the letter  $\mathsf{Q},$   for example, Q-501. Where  those routes aid in the efficient orderly management of air  traffic, they are published as preferred IFR routes.  

# Preferred IFR Routes  

Preferred IFR routes are established between busier airports  to increase system efficiency and capacity. They normally  extend through one or more ARTCC areas and are designed  to achieve balanced traffic flows among high density  terminals. IFR clearances are issued on the basis of these  routes except when severe weather avoidance procedures  or other factors dictate otherwise. Preferred IFR routes are  listed in the CS and can also be found on www.fly.faa.gov,  which requires entering the following data:  departure  airport designator, destination, route type, area, aircraft  types, altitude, route string, direction, departure ARTCC,  and arrival ARTCC. [Figure 2-14] If a flight is planned to or  from an area having such routes but the departure or arrival  point is not listed in the CS, pilots may use that part of a  preferred IFR route that is appropriate for the departure or  arrival point listed. Preferred IFR routes are correlated with  departure procedures (DPs) and STARs and may be defined  by airways, jet routes, direct routes between NAVAIDs,  

![](images/abd28e452a5dc3c6dd101797248c040a839cbd3711ad194739200935faf85cb1.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.  Chart Supplement (includes Airport/Facility Directory  section).  

waypoints, NAVAID radials/ distance measuring equipment  (DME), or any combinations thereof.  

Preferred IFR routes are published in the CS for the low and  high altitude stratum. If they begin or end with an airway  number, it indicates that the airway essentially overlies  the airport and flights normally are cleared directly on the  airway. Preferred IFR routes beginning or ending with a fix  indicate that pilots may be routed to or from these fixes  via a SID route, radar vectors, or a STAR. Routes for major  terminals are listed alphabetically under the name of the  departure airport. Where several airports are in proximity,  they are listed under the principal airport and categorized as  a metropolitan area (e.g., New York Metro Area). One way  preferred IFR routes are listed is numerically, showing the  segment fixes and the direction and times effective. Where  more than one route is listed, the routes have equal priority  for use. Official location identifiers are used in the route  description for very high frequency omnidirectional ranges  (VORs) and very high frequency omnidirectional ranges/  tactical air navigation (VORTACs), and intersection names  are spelled out. The route is direct where two NAVAIDs, an  intersection and a NAVAID, a NAVAID and a NAVAID radial  and distance point, or any navigable combination of these  route descriptions follow in succession.  

A system of preferred IFR routes helps pilots, flight crews,  and dispatchers plan a route of flight to minimize route  changes, and to aid in the efficient, orderly management  of air traffic using Federal airways. Preferred IFR routes  are designed to serve the needs of airspace users and  to provide for a systematic flow of air traffic in the major  terminal and en route flight environments. Cooperation by

all pilots in filing preferred routes results in fewer air traffic  delays and better efficiency for departure, en route, and  arrival air traffic service. [Figure 2-15]  

# Substitute Airway or Route Structures  

ARTCCs are responsible for specifying essential substitute  airway or route segments (sub-routes) and fixes for use  during scheduled or unscheduled VOR/VORTAC shutdowns.  Scheduled shutdowns of navigational facilities require  planning and coordination to ensure an uninterrupted  flow of air traffic. Aeronautical Information Services, in  coordination with the ARTCCs, determine when the length  of outages or other factors require publication of sub- routes and Flight Program Operations (AJW-3) provides  flight inspection services, obstacle clearance verification,  certification, and final approval of substitute routes.  

# Substitute Airway En Route Flight Procedures  

A schedule of proposed facility shutdowns within the region  is maintained and forwarded as far in advance as possible  to enable the substitute routes to be published. Substitute  routes are normally based on VOR/VORTAC facilities  established and published for use in the appropriate  altitude strata. In the case of substitute routes in the upper  airspace stratum, it may be necessary to establish routes by  reference to VOR/VORTAC facilities used in the low altitude  system. Non-directional (radio) beacon (NDB) facilities may  only be used where VOR/VORTAC coverage is inadequate  and ATC requirements necessitate use of such NAVAIDs.  Where operational necessity dictates, NAVAIDs may be  used beyond their standard service volume (SSV) limits that  define the reception limits of unrestricted NAVAIDs, which  are usable for random/unpublished route navigation,  provided that the routes can be given adequate frequency  protection.

Figure 2-18  Sub-route wider than existing route.  

The centerline of substitute routes must be contained  within controlled airspace [Figure 2-16], although substitute  routes for off-airway routes may not be in controlled air-  space. [Figure 2-17] Substitute routes are flight inspected  to verify clearance of controlling obstacles and to check for  satisfactory facility performance. If substitute routes do not  overlie existing routes, or are wider than existing routes,  map studies are required to identify controlling obstacles.  [Figure 2-18] The format for describing substitute routes  is from navigational fix to navigational fix. A minimum en  route altitude (MEA) and a maximum authorized altitude  (MAA) are provided for each route segment. Temporary  reporting points may be substituted for the out-of-service  facility and only those other reporting points that are  essential for ATC. Normally, temporary reporting points  over intersections are not necessary where Center radar  coverage exists. A minimum reception altitude (MRA) is  established for each temporary reporting point.  

# Tower En Route Control  

Tower en route control (TEC) is an ATC program available  to pilots that provides a service to aircraft proceeding to  and from metropolitan areas. It links designated approach  control areas by a network of identified routes made up  of the existing airway structure of the NAS, which makes  it possible to fly an IFR flight without leaving approach  control airspace. [Figure 2-19] This service is designed  to help expedite air traffic and reduces ATC and pilot  communication requirements. The program is generally  used by non-turbojet aircraft operating at and below  10,000 feet but a few facilities, such as Milwaukee and  Chicago, have allowed turbojets to proceed between  city pairs. Participating flights are relatively short with a  duration of two hours or less.  

TEC is referred to as tower en route, or tower-to-tower, and  allows flight beneath the en route structure. TEC reallocates  airspace both vertically and geographically to allow flight  planning between city pairs while remaining with approach  control airspace. All users are encouraged to use the TEC  route descriptions located in the CS when filing flight plans.  [Figure 2-20] All published TEC routes are designed to avoid  en route airspace, and the majority is within radar coverage.  

# Tower En Route Control Route Descriptions  

The graphic depiction of TEC routes located in the CS is not  to be used for navigation or for detailed flight planning  because not all city pairs are depicted. The information  is intended to show geographic areas connected by TEC.  [Figure 2-19] Pilots should refer to the route descriptions  for specific flight planning.  

As shown in Figure 2-20, the route description contains four  columns of information. The first column is the approach  control area within which the departure airport is located,  which are listed alphabetically. The second column shows  the specific route, airway, or radial that is to be used.  The third column shows the highest altitude allowed for  

![](images/d7eb7040458c5be3bb619d83d8ce9ca763fac34113e92613999647ac927ccc62.jpg)  
Figure 2-19.  Tower En Route Control (TEC) Northeast U.S. (Eastern).  

the route, and the fourth shows the destination airport,  which are also listed alphabetically. When flight planning,  it is important to always check current publications for  information about the departure and destination airport.  Routes are effective only during each respective terminal  facilities normal operating hours. Always check NOTAMs  to ensure that appropriate terminal facilities are operating  for the planned flight time. Altitudes are always listed in  thousands of feet. ATC may request that the pilot changes  altitude while in flight in order to maintain the flight within  approach control airspace. ATC provides radar monitoring  and, if necessary, course guidance if the highest altitude  assigned is below the MEA.  

Shown in Figure 2-21, under the second column, the word  “Direct” appears as the route when radar vectors are used  or no airway exists. This also indicates that a SID or STAR  may be assigned by ATC. When a NAVAID or intersection  identifier appears with no airway immediately preceding  or following the identifier, the routing is understood to be  direct to or from that point unless otherwise cleared by ATC.  Routes beginning and ending with an airway indicate that  the airway essentially overflies the airport, or radar vectors  are issued. [Figure 2-21] Where more than one route is listed  to the same destination, ensure that the correct route for  the type of aircraft classification has been filed. These are  denoted after the route in the altitude column using J (jet  powered), M (turbo props/special, cruise speed 190 knots  or greater), P (non-jet, cruise speed 190 knots or greater),  or Q (non-jet, cruise speed 189 knots or less). [Figure 2-22]  Although all airports are not listed under the destination  column, IFR flights may be planned to satellite airports in  the proximity of major airports via the same routing. When  filing flight plans, the coded route identifier (i.e., BURL 1,  VTUL4, or POML3) may be used in lieu of the route of flight.

# Airway and Route System  

There are three fixed route systems established for  air navigation purposes. They are the Federal airway  consisting of VOR (low victor airways, high jet routes),  NDB (low or medium frequency) and the RNAV route  system. To the extent possible, these route systems are  aligned in an overlying manner to facilitate transition  between each. The majority of the airways are made up  of victor airways, jet routes, and RNAV, but some low/  medium frequency (L/MF) airways and routes are still  being used in Alaska and one other that is located off  the coast of North Carolina and is called Green 13 (G13).  [Figure 2-23]  

Airway/Route Depiction  

IFR en route charts show all IFR radio NAVAIDs that have  been flight-checked by the FAA and are operational. The  FAA, Aeronautical Information Services publishes and  distributes U.S. Government Civil Aeronautical Charts and  flight information publications. IFR en route navigation  information is provided on three charts:  IFR en route low  altitude chart, IFR en route high altitude chart, and Terminal  Area Chart (TAC). [Figure 2-24A and B]

# IFR En Route Low Altitude Chart  

En route low altitude charts provide aeronautical  information for navigation under IFR conditions below  18,000 feet MSL. Low altitude charts [Figure 2-25] include  the following information:  

•   Airways  [Figure 2-25A]  •   RNAV routes [Figure 2-25B]  •   Limits of controlled airspace [Figure 2-25C]  •   VHF radio aids to navigation (frequency, identification,  channel, geographic coordinates) [Figure 2-25D]  •   Airports that have an instrument approach procedure  or a minimum 3,000 foot hard surface runway  [Figure 2-25E]  •   Off-route obstruction clearance altitudes (OROCA)  [Figure 2-25F]  •   Reporting points [Figure 2-25G]  •   Special use airspace areas [Figure 2-25H]  •   Military training routes [Figure 2-25I]  

IFR aeronautical charts depict VOR airways (airways based  on VOR or VORTAC NAVAIDs) in black, identified by a  $"\lorprime\prime$  (Victor) followed by the route number (e.g., V12). [Figure  2-26] LF/MF airways (airways based on LF/MF NAVAIDs)  are sometimes referred to as colored airways because they  are identified by color name and number (e.g., Amber One,  charted as A1). Green and red airways are plotted east and  west, and amber and blue airways are plotted north and  south. Regardless of their color identifier, LF/MF airways  are depicted in brown. [Figure 2-27]  

Airway/route data, such as the airway identifications,  bearings or radials, mileages, and altitude (e.g., MEA),  minimum obstacle clearance altitude (MOCA), and MAA,  are shown aligned with the airway and in the same color  as the airway. [Figure 2-26]  

All airways/routes that are predicated on VOR or VORTAC  NAVAIDs are defined by the outbound radial from the  NAVAID. Airways/routes that are predicated on LF/MF  NAVAIDs are defined by the inbound bearing.  

New low altitude RNAV routes have been created by the  FAA. RNAV routes provide more direct routing for IFR  aircraft and enhance the safety and efficiency of the NAS. In  order to utilize these routes, aircraft must be equipped with  IFR approved GNSS. In Alaska, when using RNAV routes, the  aircraft must be equipped with Technical Standing Order  (TSO)-145a and 146a equipment.  

Low altitude RNAV only routes are identified by the letter  “T” prefix, followed by a three digit number (T-200 to T-500).  RNAV routes are depicted in aeronautical blue, as well as the  RNAV route data, which includes the following [Figure 2-28]:  

•   Route line  •   Identification boxes

Magnetic reference bearings are shown originating from a  waypoint, fix/reporting point, or NAVAID. A GNSS MEA for  each segment is established to ensure obstacle clearance  and communications reception. All MEAs are identified  with a “G” suffix. [Figure 2-29]  

Joint Victor/RNAV routes are depicted using black for  the victor airways and blue for the RNAV routes, and the  identification boxes for each are shown adjacent to one  another.

# IFR En Route High Altitude Chart  

En route high altitude charts provide aeronautical  information for navigation under IFR conditions at and  above FL 180. [Figure 2-31] High altitude charts include  the following information:  

•   Jet route structure  •   RNAV Q-routes  •   VHF  radio  aids  to  navigation  (frequency,  ID,  channel,  geographic coordinates)  •   Selected airports  •   Reporting points  •   Navigation reference system (NRS) waypoints  [Figure 2-32]  

Jet routes are depicted in black with a “J” identifier followed  by the route number (e.g.,  $"\mathsf{J}12")$  ) and are based on VOR or

When joint Jet/RNAV routes are depicted, the route  identification boxes are located adjacent to each other with  the route charted in black. [Figure 2-35] With the exception  of  $"Q"$   routes in the Gulf of Mexico, GNSS or DME/DME/IRU  RNAV equipment is required along with radar monitoring  capabilities. For aircraft that have DME/DME/IRU RNAV  equipment, refer to the CS for specific DME information.  

# VHF Airways  

Victor airways are a system of established routes that  run along specified VOR radials, from one VOR station to  another. The purpose is to make flight planning easier  and they help ATC to organize and regulate the air traffic  flow. Almost all commercial flights are routed along these  airways but they are available for use by any pilot provided  that the proper altitudes are employed.  

# Victor Airway Navigation Procedures  

The procedure for getting established on a victor airway  is to either fly directly to a nearby VOR or to intercept  an airway radial along the route of flight. Once the pilot  is established on an airway, it is important to follow the  procedures and guidelines put in place to ensure air traffic  separation and optimal safety on the airway. When using  victor airways for navigation, procedures do not allow the  pilot to jump from one VOR to another, but must navigate  from one to the next by using the alternating outbound/  inbound procedure of linking VORs. For example, when  departing from Zanesville VOR on V-214, the pilot selects  the   $090^{\circ}$   radial with a FROM indication on the course  deviation indicator (CDI) and should correct as necessary  to continuously maintain track on the centerline of the  airway. [Figure 2-36] The pilot should continue on this  course until it is time to change over to the inbound course  to the Bellaire VOR.  

# LF/MF Airways  

The basic LF/MF airway width is 4.34 nautical miles (NM)  on each side of the centerline; the width expands by five  degrees when the distance from the facility providing  course guidance is greater than 49.66 NM. [Figure 2-37]  

# En Route Obstacle Clearance Areas  

All published routes in the NAS are based on specific  obstacle clearance criteria. An understanding of en route  obstacle clearance areas helps with SA and may help avoid  controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Obstacle clearance  areas for the en route phase of flight are identified as  primary, secondary, and turning areas.  

The primary and secondary area obstacle clearance  criteria, airway and route widths, and the ATC separation  procedures for en route segments are a function of  safety and practicality in flight procedures. These flight  procedures are dependent upon the pilot, the aircraft, and  the navigation system being used, resulting in a total VOR  system accuracy factor along with an associated probability  

![](images/19a2c9ca35dd41e764d7ae75e38b8d6f8be5d3b603d8a5c7449f671a36fdc782.jpg)

Figure 2-37.  LF/MR airway width.  

factor. The pilot/aircraft information component of these  criteria includes pilot ability to track the radial and the flight  track resulting from turns at various speeds and altitudes  under different wind conditions. The navigation system  information includes navigation facility radial alignment  displacement, transmitter monitor tolerance, and receiver  accuracy. All of these factors were considered during  development of en route criteria. From this analysis, the  computations resulted in a total system accuracy of  $\pm4.5^{\circ}$  95 percent of the time and  $\pm6.7^{\circ}\,99\$   percent of the time.  The  $4.5^{\circ}$   value became the basis for primary area obstacle  clearance criteria, airway and route widths, and the ATC  separation procedures. The  $6.7^{\circ}$   value provides secondary  obstacle clearance area dimensions.  

Primary and Secondary En Route Obstacle  Clearance Areas  

The primary obstacle clearance area has a protected width  of 8 NM with 4 NM on each side of the centerline. The  primary area has widths of route protection based upon  system accuracy of a  $\pm4.5^{\circ}$   angle from the NAVAID. These   $4.5^{\circ}$   lines extend out from the NAVAID and intersect the  boundaries of the primary area at a point approximately  51 NM from the NAVAID. Ideally, the 51 NM point is where  pilots would change over from navigating away from the  facility, to navigating toward the next facility, although this  ideal is rarely achieved. [Figure 2-38]  

![](images/e20931b1f7813c1150f2ab46416b9f5ec28984ac72b8ecb213c0dd95bd162bf4.jpg)

Figure 2-39.  Non-mountainous obstacle clearance in the primary  area.  

If the distance from the NAVAID to the change-over point  (COP) is more than 51 NM, the outer boundary of the  primary area extends beyond the 4 NM width along the   $4.5^{\circ}$   line when the COP is at midpoint. This means the  primary area, along with its obstacle clearance criteria, is  extended out into what would have been the secondary  area.  Additional differences in the obstacle clearance area  result in the case of the effect of an offset COP or dogleg  segment. For protected en route areas, the minimum  obstacle clearance in the primary area, not designated as  mountainous under 14 CFR Part 95—IFR altitude, is 1,000  feet over the highest obstacle. [Figure 2-39] The secondary  obstacle clearance area extends along a line 2 NM on each  side of the primary area. Navigation system accuracy in  the secondary area has widths of route protection of a  

![](images/0a3a085bb371e47fd345609cc949202221224a54a1a57d777900f2beb291d7e2.jpg)  
Figure 2-41.  Primary and secondary obstacle clearance area.  

$\pm6.7^{\circ}$   angle from the NAVAID. These  $6.7^{\circ}$   lines intersect the  outer boundaries of the secondary areas at the same point  as primary lines, 51 NM from the NAVAID. If the distance  from the NAVAID to the COP is more than 51 NM, the  secondary area extends along the  $6.7^{\circ}$   line when the COP  is at mid-point. [Figure 2-40] In all areas, mountainous and  non-mountainous, obstacles that are located in secondary  areas are considered as obstacles to air navigation if they  extend above the secondary obstacle clearance plane.  This plane begins at a point 500 feet above the obstacles  (natural or man-made) upon which the primary obstacle  clearance area is based, and slants upward at an angle that  causes it to intersect the outer edge of the secondary area  at a point 500 feet higher. [Figure 2-41]  

# Changeover Points  

When flying airways, pilots normally change frequencies  midway between NAVAIDs, although there are times  when this is not practical. If the navigation signals cannot  be received from the second VOR at the midpoint of the  route, a COP is depicted and shows the distance in NM to  each NAVAID. [Figure 2-42] COPs indicate the point where a  frequency change is necessary to receive course guidance  from the facility ahead of the aircraft instead of the one  

![](images/311a8ba7a986e11dfd2b62eebc60b1d749a6f9489ea665d2c5d1576f2eec7f8c.jpg)  
Figure 2-40.  Secondary obstacle clearance area.

behind. These COPs divide an airway or route segment and  ensure continuous reception of navigation signals at the  prescribed minimum en route IFR altitude. They also ensure  that other aircraft operating within the same portion of  an airway or route segment receive consistent azimuth  signals from the same navigation facilities regardless of  the direction of flight.  

Where signal coverage from two VORs overlaps at the MEA,  the COP normally is designated at the midpoint. Where  radio frequency interference or other navigation signal  problems exist, the COP is placed at the optimum location,  taking into consideration the signal strength, alignment  error, or any other known condition that affects reception.  The COP has an effect on the primary and secondary  obstacle clearance areas. On long airway or route segments,  if the distance between two facilities is over 102 NM and the  COP is placed at the midpoint, the system accuracy lines  extend beyond the minimum widths of 8 and 12 NM, and a  flare or spreading outward results at the COP. [Figure 2-43]  Offset COP and dogleg segments on airways or routes can  also result in a flare at the COP.  

# Direct Route Flights  

Direct route flights are flights that are not flown on the  radials or courses of established airways or routes. Direct  route flights must be defined by indicating the radio fixes  over which the flight passes. Fixes selected to define the  route should be those over which the position of the aircraft  can be accurately determined. Such fixes automatically  become compulsory reporting points for the flight, unless  advised otherwise by ATC. Only those NAVAIDs established  

![](images/b7a82a8466cf895ef805aa343f209922e7c9e39f72733540395e0972565836a3.jpg)

for use in a particular structure (i.e., in the low or high  structures) may be used to define the en route phase of a  direct flight within that altitude structure.  

Figure 2-44 shows a straight line on a magnetic course  from SCRAN intersection of   $270^{\circ}$   direct to the Fort Smith  Regional Airport in Arkansas that passes just north of  restricted areas R-2401A and B and R-2402. Since the airport  and the restricted areas are precisely plotted, there is an  assurance that you will stay north of the restricted areas.  From a practical standpoint, it might be better to fly direct  to the Wizer NDB. This route goes even further north of the  restricted areas and places you over the final approach fix  to Runway 25 at Fort Smith.  

The azimuth feature of VOR aids and the azimuth and  distance (DME) features of VORTAC and TACAN aids are  assigned certain frequency protected areas of airspace that  are intended for application to established airway and route  use and to provide guidance for planning flights outside  of established airways or routes. These areas of airspace  are expressed in terms of cylindrical service volumes of  specified dimensions called class limits or categories.  

An operational service volume has been established  for each class in which adequate signal coverage and  frequency protection can be assured. To facilitate use  of VOR, VORTAC, or TACAN aids, consistent with their  operational service volume limits, pilot use of such aids  for defining a direct route of flight in controlled airspace  should not exceed the following:  

1.  Operations above FL 450—use NAVAIDs not more  than 200 NM apart. These aids are depicted on en  route high altitude charts.  2.  Operation off established routes from 18,000 feet  MSL to FL 450—use NAVAIDs not more than 260  NM apart. These aids are depicted on en route high  altitude charts.  3.  Operation off established airways below 18,000 feet  MSL—use NAVAIDs not more than 80 NM apart.  These aids are depicted on en route low altitude charts.  4.  Operation off established airways between 14,500  feet MSL and 17,999 feet MSL in the conterminous  a conventional airway.  United States—(H) facilities not more than 200 NM  

Increasing use of self-contained airborne navigational  systems that do not rely on the VOR/VORTAC/TACAN  system has resulted in pilot requests for direct routes that  exceed NAVAID service volume limits. These direct route  requests are approved only in a radar environment with  approval based on pilot responsibility for navigation on the  authorized direct route. Radar flight following is provided  by ATC for ATC purposes. At times, ATC initiates a direct  route in a radar environment that exceeds NAVAID service  volume limits. In such cases, ATC provides radar monitoring  and navigational assistance as necessary.  

When filing for a direct route flight, airway or jet route  numbers, appropriate to the stratum in which operation  is conducted, may also be included to describe portions  of the route to be flown. The following is an example of  how a direct route flight would be written.  

MDW V262 BDF V10 BRL STJ SLN GCK  

Spelled out: from Chicago Midway Airport via Victor  262 to Bradford, Victor 10 to Burlington, Iowa, direct St.  Joseph, Missouri, direct Salina, Kansas, direct Garden  City, Kansas.  

Note:  When route of flight is described by radio fixes,  the pilot is expected to fly a direct course between the  points named.  

Pilots should keep in mind that they are responsible  for adhering to obstruction clearance requirements  on those segments of direct routes that are outside of  controlled airspace. The MEAs and other altitudes shown  on low altitude IFR en route charts pertain to those route  segments within controlled airspace, and those altitudes  may not meet obstruction clearance criteria when  operating off those routes.  

# Published RNAV Routes  

Published RNAV routes are fixed, permanent routes that  can be flight planned and flown by aircraft with RNAV  capability. These are being expanded worldwide as  new RNAV routes are developed, and existing charted,  conventional routes are being designated for RNAV use. It  is important to be alert to the rapidly changing application  of RNAV techniques being applied to conventional en  route airways. Published RNAV routes may potentially be  found on any en route chart. The published RNAV route  designation may be obvious, or, on the other hand, RNAV  route designations may be less obvious, as in the case  where a published route shares a common flight track with  therefore, en route charts are continuously being updated  for information changes, and you may find some differences  between charts.  

Basic designators for air traffic service (ATS) routes and  their use in voice communications have been established.  One of the main purposes of a system of route designators  is to allow both pilots and ATC to make unambiguous  reference to RNAV airways and routes. Basic designators  for ATS routes consist of a maximum of five, and in no  case to exceed six, alpha/numeric characters in order to be  usable by both ground and airborne automation systems.  The designator indicates the type of the route, such as  high/low altitude, specific airborne navigation equipment  requirements, such as RNAV, and the aircraft type using the  route primarily and exclusively. The basic route designator  consists of one or two letter(s) followed by a number from  1 to 999.  

# Composition of Designators  

The prefix letters that pertain specifically to RNAV  designations are included in the following list:  

1.  The basic designator consists of one letter of the  alphabet followed by a number from 1 to 999. The  letters may be:  a.  A, B, G, R—for routes that form part of the  regional networks of ATS route and are not  RNAV routes;  b.  L, M, N, P—for RNAV routes that form part of  the regional networks of ATS routes;  c.  H, J, V, W—for routes that do not form part of  the regional networks of ATS routes and are not  RNAV routes;  d.  Q, T, Y, Z—for RNAV routes that do not form  part of the regional networks of ATS routes.  2.  Where applicable, one supplementary letter must be  added as a prefix to the basic designator as follows:  a.  K—to indicate a low level route established for  use primarily by helicopters;  b.  U—to indicate that the route or portion thereof  is established in the upper airspace;  c.  S—to indicate a route established exclusively for  use by supersonic aircraft during acceleration/  deceleration and while in supersonic flight.  3.  Where applicable, a supplementary letter may be  added after the basic designator of the ATS route as  a suffix as follows:  

a.  F—to indicate that on the route or portion thereof  advisory service only is provided;  

b.  G—to indicate that on the route or portion thereof  flight information services only is provided;  c.  Y—for RNP 1 routes at and above FL 200 to  indicate that all turns on the route between  $30^{\circ}$    and  $90^{\circ}$   must be made within the tolerance of a  tangential arc between the straight leg segments  defined with a radius of   $22.5\:\mathsf{N M};$  ;  d.  Z—for RNP 1 routes at and below FL 190 to  indicate that all turns on the route between  $30^{\circ}$    and  $90^{\circ}$   should be made within the tolerance  of a tangential arc between the straight leg  segments defined with a radius of 15 NM.  

Note:  RNAV Q-routes require en route RNAV 2, corresponding  NAV/E2 code and PBN/C1-C4 based on navigation system  update source.  

Use of Designators in Communications  

In voice communications, the basic letter of a designator  should be spoken in accordance with the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO) spelling alphabet. Where the  prefixes K, U, or S, previously mentioned, are used in voice  communications, they should be pronounced as:  

K—Kopter  

U—Upper, as in the English language  

S—Supersonic  

Where suffixes F, G, Y or Z specified in above, are used, the  flight crew should not be required to use them in voice  communications. Below is an example of how the letters  and numbers are spoken.  

A11—Alpha Eleven  UR5—Upper Romeo Five  KB34—Kopter Bravo Thirty Four  UW456—Upper Whiskey Four Fifty Six

Figure 2-45.  Published RNAV jet routes.  

The en route chart excerpt depicts three published RNAV jet  routes: J804R, J888R, and J996R. [Figure 2-45] The R suffix  is a supplementary route designator denoting an RNAV  route. The overlapping symbols for the AMOTT intersection  and waypoint indicate that AMOTT can be identified by  conventional navigation or by latitude and longitude  coordinates. Although coordinates were originally included  for aircraft equipped with an inertial navigation system  (INS), they are now a good way to cross check between  the coordinates on the chart and in the flight management  system (FMS) or global positioning system (GPS) databases  to ensure you are tracking on your intended en route  course. The AMOTT RNAV waypoint includes bearing and  distance from the Anchorage VORTAC.  

# Random RNAV Routes  

Random RNAV routes are direct routes that are based on  RNAV capability between waypoints defined in terms of  latitude or longitude coordinates, degree-distance fixes,  or offsets from established routes or airways at a specified  distance and direction. Radar monitoring by ATC is required  on all random RNAV routes. Random RNAV routes can  only be approved in a radar environment. Factors that  are considered by ATC when approving random RNAV  routes include the capability to provide radar monitoring  and compatibility with traffic volume and flow. ATC radar  monitor each flight; however, navigation on the random  RNAV route is the responsibility of the pilot.  

Pilots flying aircraft that are equipped with approved area  navigation equipment may file for RNAV routes throughout  the NAS and may be filed for in accordance with the  following procedures:  

1.   File airport-to-airport flight plans.  2.   File  the  appropriate  RNAV  capability  certification  suffix in the flight plan.  3.   Plan the random route portion of the flight plan  to begin and end over appropriate arrival and  departure transition fixes or appropriate NAVAIDs  for the altitude stratum within which the flight is  conducted. The use of normal preferred DPs and  STAR, where established, is recommended.  4.   File route structure transitions to and from the  random route portion of the flight.  5.   Define the random route by waypoints. File route  description waypoints by using degree distance fixes  based on navigational aids that are appropriate for  the altitude stratum.  6.   File a minimum of one route description waypoint  for each ARTCC through whose area the random route is flown. These waypoints must be located  within 200 NM of the preceding center’s boundary.  

7.  File an additional route description waypoint for  each turnpoint in the route.  8.  Plan additional route description waypoints as  required to ensure accurate navigation via the filed  route of flight. Navigation is the pilot’s responsibility  unless ATC assistance is requested.  9.  Plan the route of flight so as to avoid prohibited and  restricted airspace by 3 NM unless permission has  been obtained to operate in that airspace and the  appropriate ATC facilities are advised.  

Note: To be approved for use in the NAS, RNAV equipment  must meet the appropriate system availability, accuracy,  and airworthiness standards. For additional guidance  on equipment requirements, see Advisory Circular (AC)  20-138C, Airworthiness Approval of Positioning and  Navigation Systems. For airborne navigation database,  see AC 90-105, Approval Guidance for RNP Operations  and Barometric Vertical Navigation in the U.S. National  Airspace System.  

Pilots flying aircraft that are equipped with latitude/  longitude coordinate navigation capability, independent  of VOR/ TACAN references, may file for random RNAV routes  at and above FL 390 within the conterminous United States  using the following procedures:  

1.  File airport-to-airport flight plans prior to departure.  2.  File the appropriate RNAV capability certification  suffix in the flight plan.  3.  Plan the random route portion of the flight to  begin and end over published departure/arrival  transition fixes or appropriate NAVAIDs for airports  without published transition procedures. The use of  preferred departure and arrival routes, such as DP  and STAR where established, is recommended.  4.  Plan the route of flight so as to avoid prohibited and  restricted airspace by 3 NM unless permission has  been obtained to operate in that airspace and the  appropriate ATC facility is advised.  5.  Define the route of flight after the departure fix,  including each intermediate fix (turnpoint) and  the arrival fix for the destination airport in terms  of latitude/longitude coordinates plotted to the  nearest minute or in terms of Navigation Reference  System (NRS) waypoints. For latitude/longitude  filing, the arrival fix must be identified by both the  latitude/ longitude coordinates and a fix identifier  as shown in the example below.  

MIA 1  SRQ 2  3407/10615 3    3407/11546 TNP 4  LAX 5    1 Departure airport  

2 Departure fix  3 Intermediate fix (turning point)  4 Arrival fix  5 Destination airport  

# Or:  

ORD1 IOW2 KP49G3 KD34U4 KL16O5 OAL6 MOD27 SFO 8  

1 Departure airport  2 Transition fix (pitch point)  3 Minneapolis ARTCC waypoint  4 Denver ARTCC waypoint  5 Los Angeles ARTCC waypoint (catch point)  6 Transition fix  7 Arrival  8 Destination airport  

6.  Record latitude/longitude coordinates by four  figures describing latitude in degrees and minutes  followed by a solidus and five figures describing  longitude in degrees and minutes. 

 7.  File at FL 390 or above for the random RNAV portion  of the flight. 

 8.  Fly all routes/route segments on Great Circle tracks. 

 9.  Make any in-flight requests for random RNAV  clearances or route amendments to an en route ATC  facility.

# Off-Airway Routes  

14 CFR Part 95 prescribes altitudes governing the operation  of aircraft under IFR on Federal airways, jet routes, RNAV low  or high altitude routes, and other direct routes for which a  MEA is designated. In addition, it designates mountainous  areas and COPs. Off-airway routes are established in the  same manner and in accordance with the same criteria  as airways and jet routes. If a pilot flies for a scheduled air  carrier or operator for compensation or hire, any requests for  the establishment of off-airway routes are initiated by the  company through the principal operations inspector (POI)  who works directly with the company and coordinates FAA  approval. Air carrier authorized routes should be contained  in the company’s Operations Specifications (OpSpecs) under  the auspices of the air carrier operating certificate. [Figure  2-46]  

Off-airway routes predicated on public navigation  facilities and wholly contained within controlled airspace  are published as direct Part 95 routes. Off-airway routes  predicated on privately owned navigation facilities or  not contained wholly within controlled airspace are  published as off-airway non-Part 95 routes. In evaluating  the adequacy of off-airway routes, the following items are  considered: the type of aircraft and navigation systems  used; proximity to military bases, training areas, low level  military routes; and the adequacy of communications  along the route.  

Commercial operators planning to fly off-airway routes  should have specific instructions in the company’s  OpSpecs that address en route limitations and provisions  regarding en route authorizations to use the GPS or other  RNAV systems in the NAS. The company’s manuals and  checklists should include practices and procedures for  long-range navigation and training on the use of long  range navigation equipment. Minimum equipment lists  (MELs) and maintenance programs must address the long  range navigation equipment. Examples of other selected  areas requiring specialized en route authorization include  the following:  

•   Class I navigation in the United States Class A  airspace using area of long range navigation system.  •   Class II navigation using multiple long range  navigation systems.  •   Operations in central East Pacific airspace.  •   North Pacific operations.  •   Operations within North Atlantic (NAT) minimum  navigation performance specifications (MNPS)  airspace.  

•   Operations in areas of magnetic unreliability.  •   North Atlantic operation (NAT/OPS) with two engine  aircraft under 14 CFR Part 121.  •   Extended range operations (ER-OPS) with two  engine aircraft under 14 CFR Part 121.  •   Special fuel reserves in international operations.  •   Planned in-flight re-dispatch or re-release en route.  •   Extended over water operations using a single long- range communication system.  •   Operations in reduced vertical separation minimum  (RVSM) airspace.  

# Off-Route Obstruction Clearance Altitude  

An off-route obstruction clearance altitude (OROCA) is  an off-route altitude that provides obstruction clearance  with a 1,000-foot buffer in non-mountainous terrain areas  and a 2,000-foot buffer in designated mountainous areas  within the United States. This altitude may not provide  signal coverage from ground-based NAVAIDs, ATC radar,  or communications coverage. OROCAs are intended  primarily as a pilot tool for emergencies and SA. OROCAs  depicted on en route charts do not provide the pilot with  an acceptable altitude for terrain and obstruction clearance  for the purposes of off-route, random RNAV direct flights  in either controlled or uncontrolled airspace. OROCAs  are not subject to the same scrutiny as MEAs, minimum  vectoring altitude (MVAs), MOCAs, and other minimum IFR  altitudes. Since they do not undergo the same obstruction  evaluation, airport airspace analysis procedures, or  flight inspection, they cannot provide the same level of  confidence as the other minimum IFR altitudes.  

When departing an airport VFR intending to or needing to  obtain an IFR clearance en route, you must be aware of the  position of your aircraft relative to terrain and obstructions.  When accepting a clearance below the MEA, MIA, MVA,  or the OROCA, you are responsible for your own terrain/  obstruction clearance until reaching the MEA, MIA, or MVA.  If unable to visually maintain terrain/obstruction clearance,  pilots should advise ATC and state intentions of the flight.  [Figure 2-47]  

![](images/c9420e0e23b1780940489c9f013620c9945bc220786c4dd2b32bd8d483ced7c8.jpg)

Figure 2-48.  Random RNAV route.  

For all random RNAV flights, there needs to be at least one  waypoint in each ARTCC area through which you intend  to fly. One of the biggest problems in creating an RNAV  direct route is determining if the route goes through special  use airspace. For most direct routes, the chances of going  through prohibited, restricted, or special use airspace  are good. In the United States, all direct routes should be  planned to avoid prohibited or restricted airspace by at  least 3 NM. If a bend in a direct route is required to avoid  special use airspace, the turning point needs to be part  of the flight plan. Two of the most prominent long range  navigation systems today include FMS with integrated GPS  and stand-alone GPS. The following example is a simplified  overview showing how the RNAV systems might be used  to fly a random RNAV route.  

Shown in Figure 2-48, the aircraft is northeast of Tuba City  VORTAC at FL 200 using RNAV (showing both GPS and  FMS), RNAV direct on a southwesterly heading to Lindbergh  Regional Airport in Winslow. As the pilot is monitoring his  or her position and cross-checking the avionics against the  high altitude en route chart, he or she receives a company  message instructing to divert to Las Vegas, requiring a  change in the flight plan as highlighted on the depicted  chart excerpt.  

During the flight deck review of the high and low altitude  en route charts, the pilot determines that the best course  of action is to fly direct to the MIRAJ waypoint, 28 DME  northeast of the Las Vegas VORTAC on the  $045^{\circ}$   radial. This  places the aircraft 193 NM out on a   $259^{\circ}$   magnetic course  inbound, and may help to avoid diverting north, allowing to  bypass the more distant originating and intermediate fixes  feeding into Las Vegas. The pilot requests an RNAV random  route clearance direct MIRAJ to expedite the flight. Denver  Center comes back with the following amended flight plan  and initial clearance into Las Vegas:  

“Marathon five sixty four, turn right heading two six zero,  descend and maintain one six thousand, cleared present  position direct MIRAJ.”  

The latitude and longitude coordinates of the aircraft’s  present position on the high altitude chart is N36 19.10  and W110 40.24  as the course is changed. Notice the GPS  moving map (upper left), the FMS control display unit 

 (below the GPS), and FMS map mode navigation displays 

 (to the right of the GPS) as the flight is rerouted to Las Vegas.  For SA, the pilot makes note that the altitude is well above  any of the OROCAs on the direct route as the flight arrives  in the Las Vegas area using the low altitude chart.  

# Monitoring of Navigation Facilities  

VOR, VORTAC, and instrument landing system (ILS) facilities,  as well as most NDBs and marker beacons installed by the  FAA, are provided with an internal monitoring feature.  Internal monitoring is provided at the facility through  the use of equipment that causes a facility shutdown if  performance deteriorates below established tolerances.  A remote status indicator also may be provided through  the use of a signal-sampling receiver, microwave link, or  telephone circuit. Older FAA NDBs and some non-Federal  NDBs do not have the internal feature, and monitoring is  accomplished by manually checking the operation at least  once each hour. FAA facilities, such as automated flight  service stations (AFSSs) and ARTCCs/sectors, are usually  the control point for NAVAID facility status. Pilots can query  the appropriate FAA facility if they have questions in flight  regarding NAVAID status, in addition to checking NOTAMs  prior to flight, since NAVAIDs and associated monitoring  equipment are continuously changing.  

# Navigational Gaps  

A navigational course guidance gap, referred to as an  MEA gap, describes a distance along an airway or route  segment where a gap in navigational signal coverage  exists. The navigational gap may not exceed a specific  distance that varies directly with altitude, from 0 NM at sea  level to 65 NM at 45,000 feet MSL and not more than one  gap may exist in the airspace structure for the airway or  route segment. Additionally, a gap usually does not occur  at any airway or route turning point. To help ensure the  maximum amount of continuous positive course guidance  available when flying, there are established en route criteria  for both straight and turning segments. Where large gaps  exist that require altitude changes, MEA “steps” may be  established at increments of not less than 2,000 feet below  18,000 feet MSL, or not less than 4,000 feet at 18,000 MSL  and above, provided that a total gap does not exist for the  entire segment within the airspace structure. MEA steps are  limited to one step between any two facilities to eliminate  continuous or repeated changes of altitude in problem areas.  The allowable navigational gaps pilots can expect to see  are determined, in part, by reference to the graph depicted  in Figure 2-49. Notice the en route chart excerpt depicting  that the MEA is established with a gap in navigation signal  coverage northwest of the Carbon VOR/DME on V134.  At  the MEA of 13,000, the allowable navigation course guidance  gap is approximately 18.5 NM, as depicted in Figure 2-49.  The navigation gap area is not identified on the chart  by distances from the navigation facilities. Proper flight  planning will help pilots prepare for MEA gaps by insuring  that appropriate maps are available as they may need  to dead reckon through the gap. Calculating the ground  track (with adjustments for winds) before and after the gap  will also help to stay on course when navigational course  guidance is not available.  

# NAVAID Accuracy Check  

The CFRs and good judgment dictate that the equipment  of aircraft flying under IFR be within a specified tolerance  before taking off. When approved procedures are available,  they should be used for all equipment inspections.  

# VOR Accuracy  

VOR accuracy can be checked by using any of the following  methods: VOR test facility signal (VOT), VOR checkpoint  signs, dual VOR check, or airborne VOR check.  

# VOT  

The VOT is an approved test signal and is located on an  airport. This enables the pilot to check the VOR accuracy  from the flight deck before takeoff. Listed below are the  steps used for a VOT:  

1.  Tune the VOR receiver to the VOT frequency. VOT  frequencies can be found in the CS. [Figure 2-50]  These frequencies are coded with a series of Morse  code dots or a continuous 1020-cycle tone.

Figure 2-51.  VOR checkpoint signs.  

2.  On the VOR, set the course selector to   $0^{\circ}$   and the  track bar (TB) indicator should read center. The TO­ FROM indicator should read FROM.  3.  Set the course selector to   $180^{\circ}$   and the TO-FROM  indicator should read TO and the TB should then be  centered.  

Note: Determining the exact error in the receiver is done  by turning the track selector until the TB is centered and  noting the degrees difference between   $\it{180^{o}}$  or  $O^{o}.$   The  maximum bearing error with the VOT system check is plus  or minus  $\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}^{o}$  and apparent errors greater than  $\scriptstyle\mathcal{A}^{o}$  indicate  that the VOR receiver is beyond acceptable tolerance.  

# VOR Checkpoint Signs  

Many aerodromes have VOR checkpoint signs that are  located beside the taxiways. [Figure 2-51] These signs  indicate the exact point on the aerodrome that there is  sufficient signal strength from a VOR to check the aircraft’s  VOR receiver against the radial designated on the sign.  Listed below are the steps to use at a VOR checkpoint:  

1.   Tune the proper VOR frequency.  2.   Identify the VOR frequency.  3.   Set the published radial on the course deviation  indicator (CDI).  4.   Confirm that the TB is centered.  5.   Check the needle sensitivity by changing the  omnibearing select (OBS)  $10^{\circ}$   each way.  6.   Set the reciprocal of the radial and check the TO ­ FROM flag change.  7.   The maximum permissible difference between  aircraft equipment and the designated radial is   $4^{\circ}$    and 0.5 NM of the posted distance.  

# Dual VOR Check  

If a VOT or VOR checkpoint is not available and the aircraft is  equipped with dual VORs, the equipment may be checked  against one another by tuning both sets to the VOR facility  at the same time and noting the indicated bearings to that  station. [Figure 2-52] A difference greater than  $4^{\circ}$   between  the two VORs indicates that one of the receivers may be  out of tolerance.  

# Airborne VOR Check  

V OR equipment can also be checked for accuracy while in  fl ight by flying over a fix or landmark located on a published  r adial and noting the indicated radial. Variances of more  t han  $6^{\circ}$   from the published radial should be considered out  o f tolerance and not be used for IFR navigation.  

# NDB Accuracy Check  

T he pilot must identify an NDB before using it for  n avigation, and continuously monitor it while using it  f or an instrument approach.  The lack of an IDENT may  i ndicate that the NDB is out of service, even though it may  s till be transmitting (for instance for maintenance or test  purposes). If an incorrect IDENT is heard, then the NDB  should not be used.  

# RNAV Accuracy Check  

RNAV accuracy checks may differ depending on the  different type of equipment and manufacturer. When  available, all written procedures should be followed.  

![](images/cbe4d60c91d47dfcd8cc91bc33ed9d24145401182003694283187830f6be78ad.jpg)  
Figure 2-52.  Instrument panel with dual VORs.  

Below is a list of generic checks that should be used when  checking the accuracy of the system prior to flight.  

1.  System initialization—pilots should confirm that  the navigation database is current and verify that the  aircrafts present position has been entered correctly.  2.  Active flight plan check—the active flight plan  should be checked by comparing the aeronautical  charts, departure and arrival procedures, and other  applicable documents with the map display.  

![](images/6f847c524585812e4c8b3e1d437a2127246c8b37682c5f38a8e831041c5dbd54.jpg)  
Figure 2-53.  Fly-by and fly-over waypoints.  

3.  Prior to takeoff—ensure that the RNAV system is  available. If possible, check to see that the system  is updating when aircraft position is changing.  

Note: While in flight, continue to verify system accuracy  by displaying bearing/range to a VOR/DME on the RNAV  system and compare it to the actual RMI reading of that  particular NAVAID.  

# Waypoints  

Waypoints are predetermined geographical locations that  are defined in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates or  fixes, used to define an RNAV route or the flight path of  an aircraft employing RNAV. Waypoints may be a simple  named point in space or may be associated with existing  NAVAIDs, intersections, or fixes. A waypoint is most often  used to indicate a change in direction, speed, or altitude  along the desired path. Aviation RNAV procedures make  use of both fly-over and fly-by waypoints. A fly-over  waypoint is a waypoint that must be crossed vertically by  an aircraft. A fly-by waypoint is a waypoint that marks the  intersection of two straight paths, with the transition from  one path to another being made by the aircraft using a  precisely calculated turn that flies by but does not vertically  cross the waypoint. [Figure 2-53]  

# User-Defined Waypoints  

Pilots typically create user-defined waypoints for use in  their own random RNAV direct navigation. They are newly  established, unpublished airspace fixes that are designated  geographic locations/positions that help provide positive  course guidance for navigation and a means of checking  progress on a flight. They may or may not be actually  plotted by the pilot on en route charts, but would normally  be communicated to ATC in terms of bearing and distance  or latitude/longitude. An example of user-defined  waypoints typically includes those generated by various  means including keyboard input, and even electronic map  mode functions used to establish waypoints with a cursor  on the display.  

Another example is an offset phantom waypoint, which is  a point-in-space formed by a bearing and distance from  NAVAIDs, such as VORTACs and tactical air navigation  (TACAN) stations, using a variety of navigation systems.  When specifying unpublished waypoints in a flight plan,  they can be communicated using the frequency/bearing/  distance format or latitude and longitude, and they  automatically become compulsory reporting points unless  otherwise advised by ATC. All aircraft with latitude and  longitude navigation systems flying above FL 390 must use  latitude and longitude to define turning points.  

# Floating Waypoints  

Floating waypoints, or reporting points, represent  airspace fixes at a point in space not directly associated  with a conventional airway. In many cases, they may be  established for such purposes as ATC metering fixes,  holding points, RNAV-direct routing, gateway waypoints,  STAR origination points leaving the en route structure,  and SID terminating points joining the en route structure.  In the top example of Figure 2-54, a low altitude en route  chart depicts three floating waypoints that have been  highlighted:  SCORR, FILUP, and CHOOT. Notice that  waypoints are named with five-letter identifiers that are  unique and pronounceable. Pilots must be careful of  similar waypoint names. Notice on the high altitude en  route chart excerpt in the bottom example, the similar  sounding and spelled floating waypoint named SCOOR,  rather than SCORR. This emphasizes the importance  of correctly entering waypoints into database-driven  navigation systems. One waypoint character incorrectly  entered into your navigation system could adversely affect  your flight. The SCOOR floating reporting point also is

depicted on a Severe Weather Avoidance Plan (SWAP) en  route chart. These waypoints and SWAP routes assist pilots  and controllers when severe weather affects the East Coast.  

# Computer Navigation Performance  

An integral part of RNAV using en route charts typically  involves the use of airborne navigation databases.  Because GPS receivers are basically “to-to” navigators,  they must always be navigating to a defined point. On  overlay approaches, if no pronounceable five-character  name is published for an approach waypoint or fix, it has  been given a database identifier consisting of letters and  numbers. These points appear in the list of waypoints in the  approach procedure database, but may not appear on the  approach chart. A point used for the purpose of defining  the navigation track for an airborne computer system (i.e.,  GPS or FMS) is called a Computer Navigation Fix (CNF). CNFs  include unnamed DME fixes, beginning and ending points  of DME arcs, and sensor final approach fixes (FAFs) on some  GPS overlay approaches.  

To aid in the approach chart/database correlation process,  the FAA has begun a program to assign five-letter names  to CNFs and to chart CNFs on various National Oceanic  Service aeronautical products. [Figure 2-55] These CNFs  are not to be used for any ATC application, such as holding  for which the fix has not already been assessed. CNFs are  charted to distinguish them from conventional reporting  points, fixes, intersections, and waypoints. A CNF name is  enclosed in parenthesis, e.g., (MABEE) and is placed next  to the CNF it defines. If the CNF is not at an existing point  defined by means such as crossing radials or radial/DME,  the point is indicated by an X. The CNF name is not used in  filing a flight plan or in aircraft/ATC communications. Use  current phraseology (e.g., facility name, radial, distance) to  describe these fixes.

Figure 2-55.  Computer navigation fix.  

Many of the RNAV systems available today make it all  too easy to forget that en route charts are still required  and necessary for flight. As important as databases are,  they really are onboard the aircraft to provide navigation  guidance and situational awareness (SA); they are not  intended as a substitute for paper charts. When flying  with GPS, FMS, or planning a flight with a computer, it is  critical to understand the limitations of the system you are  using, for example, incomplete information, unloadable  procedures, complex procedures, and database storage  limitations.  

# Required Navigation Performance  

Required navigation performance (RNP) is RNAV with  onboard navigation monitoring and alerting. RNP is also  a statement of navigation performance necessary for  operation within a defined airspace. A critical component  of RNP is the ability of the aircraft navigation system to  monitor its achieved navigation performance, and to  identify for the pilot whether the operational requirement  is, or is not being met during an operation. This onboard  performance monitoring and alerting capability;  therefore, allows a lessened reliance on ATC intervention  (via radar monitoring, automatic dependent surveillance- broadcast (ADS-B), multilateration, communications),  and/or route separation to achieve the overall safety of  the operation. RNP capability of the aircraft is a major  component in determining the separation criteria to  ensure that the overall containment of the operation is  met.  

The RNP capability of an aircraft varies depending upon  the aircraft equipment and the navigation infrastructure.  For example, an aircraft may be equipped and certified  for RNP 1.0, but may not be capable of RNP 1.0 operations  due to limited NAVAID coverage.  

![](images/2b15b658503c19f8933e8a452702f70a48b2936e72c96d4410b51f8e51280d98.jpg)  
Figure 2-56.  U.S. standard RNP levels.  

An RNP level or type is applicable to a selected airspace,  route, or procedure. As defined in the Pilot/Controller  Glossary, the RNP level or type is a value typically expressed  as a distance in nautical miles from the intended centerline  of a procedure, route, or path. RNP applications also  account for potential errors at some multiple of RNP level  (e.g., twice the RNP level).  

# Standard RNP Levels  

United States standard values supporting typical RNP  airspace are shown in Figure 2-56. Other RNP levels as  identified by ICAO, other states, and the FAA may also be  used.  

# Application of Standard RNP Levels  

United States standard levels of RNP typically used for  various routes and procedures supporting RNAV operations  may be based on use of a specific navigational system  or sensor, such as GPS, or on multi-sensor RNAV systems  having suitable performance.  

Note:  The performance of navigation in RNP refers not only  to the level of accuracy of a particular sensor or aircraft  navigation system, but also to the degree of precision  with which the aircraft is flown. Specific required flight  procedures may vary for different RNP levels.  

# IFR En Route Altitudes  

Minimum En Route Altitudes (MEAs), Minimum Reception  Altitudes (MRAs), Maximum Authorized Altitudes (MAAs),  Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitudes (MOCAs),  Minimum  Turning Altitudes (MTAs) and Minimum Crossing Altitudes  (MCAs) are established by the FAA for instrument flight  along Federal airways, as well as some off-airway routes.  The altitudes are established after it has been determined  that the NAVAIDs to be used are adequate and so oriented  on the airways or routes that signal coverage is acceptable,  and that flight can be maintained within prescribed route  widths.  

For IFR operations, regulations require that pilots operate  their aircraft at or above minimum altitudes. Except when  necessary for takeoff or landing, pilots may not operate an  aircraft under IFR below applicable minimum altitudes, or  if no applicable minimum altitude is prescribed, in the case  of operations over an area designated as mountainous, an  altitude of 2,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a  horizontal distance of 4 NM from the course to be flown. In  any other case, an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest  obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 NM from the  course to be flown must be maintained as a minimum  altitude. If both a MEA and a MOCA are prescribed for a  particular route or route segment, pilots may operate an  aircraft below the MEA down to, but not below, the MOCA,  only when within 22 NM of the VOR. When climbing to  a higher minimum IFR altitude (MIA), pilots must begin  climbing immediately after passing the point beyond  which that minimum altitude applies, except when ground  obstructions intervene, the point beyond which that higher  minimum altitude applies must be crossed at or above the  applicable MCA for the VOR.  

If on an IFR flight plan, but cleared by ATC to maintain VFR  conditions on top, pilots may not fly below minimum en  route IFR altitudes. Minimum altitude rules are designed to  ensure safe vertical separation between the aircraft and the  terrain. These minimum altitude rules apply to all IFR flights,  whether in IFR or VFR weather conditions, and whether  assigned a specific altitude or VFR conditions on top.  

# Minimum En Route Altitude (MEA)  

The MEA is the lowest published altitude between radio  fixes that assures acceptable navigational signal coverage  and meets obstacle clearance requirements between those  fixes. The MEA prescribed for a Federal airway or segment,  RNAV low or high route, or other direct route applies to the  entire width of the airway, segment, or route between the  radio fixes defining the airway, segment, or route. MEAs  for routes wholly contained within controlled airspace  normally provide a buffer above the floor of controlled  airspace consisting of at least 300 feet within transition  areas and 500 feet within control areas. MEAs are established  based upon obstacle clearance over terrain and manmade  objects, adequacy of navigation facility performance, and  communications requirements.  

# RNAV Minimum En Route Altitude  

RNAV MEAs are depicted on some IFR en route low altitude  charts, allowing both RNAV and non-RNAV pilots to use the  same chart for instrument navigation.  

# Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA)  

MRAs are determined by FAA flight inspection traversing  an entire route of flight to establish the minimum altitude  the navigation signal can be received for the route and for  off-course NAVAID facilities that determine a fix. When the  MRA at the fix is higher than the MEA, an MRA is established  for the fix and is the lowest altitude at which an intersection  can be determined.  

# Maximum Authorized Altitude (MAA)  

An MAA is a published altitude representing the maximum  usable altitude or flight level for an airspace structure  

![](images/c73107b6a64aabffb4f8e885bb8134e2dc042ac2160fe76306ab2c31d5eba620.jpg)

or route segment. [Figure 2-57] It is the highest altitude  on a Federal airway, jet route, RNAV low or high route,  or other direct route for which an MEA is designated at  which adequate reception of navigation signals is assured.  MAAs represent procedural limits determined by technical  limitations or other factors, such as limited airspace or  frequency interference of ground-based facilities.  

# Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude  (MOCA)  

The MOCA is the lowest published altitude in effect between  fixes on VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route segments  that meets obstacle clearance requirements for the entire  route segment. [Figure 2-58] This altitude also assures  acceptable navigational signal coverage only within 22 NM  of a VOR. The MOCA seen on the en route chart may have  been computed by adding the required obstacle clearance  (ROC) to the controlling obstacle in the primary area or  computed by using a TERPS chart if the controlling obstacle  is located in the secondary area. This figure is then rounded  to the nearest 100 foot increment (i.e., 2,049 feet becomes  2,000, and 2,050 feet becomes 2,100 feet). An extra 1,000

feet is added in mountainous areas, in most cases.  

ATC controllers have an important role in helping pilots  remain clear of obstructions. Controllers are instructed to  issue a safety alert if the aircraft is in a position that, in their  judgment, places the pilot in unsafe proximity to terrain,  obstructions, or other aircraft. Once pilots inform ATC of  action being taken to resolve the situation, the controller  may discontinue the issuance of further alerts. A typical  terrain/obstruction alert may sound like this: “(Aircraft call  sign ), Low altitude alert. Check your altitude immediately.  The MOCA in your area is 12,000.”  

# Minimum Turning Altitude (MTA)  

Minimum turning altitude (MTA) is a charted altitude  providing vertical and lateral obstruction clearance based  on turn criteria over certain fixes, NAVAIDs, waypoints,  and on charted route segments. [Figure 2-59] When a  VHF airway or route terminates at a NAVAID or fix, the  primary area extends beyond that termination point.  When a change of course on VHF airways and routes is  necessary, the en route obstacle clearance turning area  extends the primary and secondary obstacle clearance  areas to accommodate the turn radius of the aircraft. Since  turns at or after fix passage may exceed airway and route  boundaries, pilots are expected to adhere to airway and  route protected airspace by leading turns early before a  fix. The turn area provides obstacle clearance for both turn  anticipation (turning prior to the fix) and flyover protection  (turning after crossing the fix). This does not violate the  requirement to fly the centerline of the airway. Many factors  enter into the construction and application of the turning  area to provide pilots with adequate obstacle clearance  protection. These may include aircraft speed, the amount  of turn versus NAVAID distance, flight track, curve radii,  MEAs, and MTA. [Figure 2-60]  

Due to increased airspeeds at 10,000 feet MSL or above, an  expanded area in the vicinity of the turning fix is examined  to ensure the published MEA is sufficient for obstacle  clearance. In some locations (normally mountainous),  terrain/obstacles in the expanded search area may obviate  the published MEA and necessitate a higher minimum  altitude while conducting the turning maneuver. Turning  fixes requiring a higher MTA are charted with a flag along  with accompanying text describing the MTA restriction.  [Figure 2-59]  

An MTA restriction normally consists of the ATS route  leading to the turning fix, the ATS route leading from the  turning fix, and an altitude (e.g., MTA V330 E TO V520  W 16000). When an MTA is applicable for the intended  route of flight, pilots must ensure they are at or above the  charted MTA prior to beginning the turn and maintain at  

![Figure 2-61.  Minimum turning altitude information located in the remarks section of FAA Form 8260-16 Transmittal of Airways/Route Data.  ](images/6a920e8547e8a706fdadbd3a84814a19d116c3ff5f6c94b1fccdbe6c2cd9e3d7.jpg)

or above the MTA until joining the centerline of the ATS  route following the turn. Once established on the centerline  following the turning fix, the MEA/MOCA determines the  minimum altitude available for assignment.  

An MTA may also preclude the use of a specific altitude or  a range of altitudes during a turn. For example, the MTA  may restrict the use of 10,000 through 11,000 feet MSL.  In this case, any altitude greater than 11,000 feet MSL is  unrestricted, as are altitudes less than 10,000 feet MSL  provided MEA/MOCA requirements are satisfied.  

All MTA information associated with the airway/route  inbound to the turn fix/facility is put in the remarks section  of FAA Form 8260-16, Transmittal of Airways/Route Data,  using the following format [Figure 2-61]:  

#CHART: MTA V330 E TO V520 W 16000

Figure 2-63.  Minimum crossing altitude (MCA) determination point.  

# Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA)  

An MCA is the lowest altitude at certain fixes at which the  aircraft must cross when proceeding in the direction of a  higher minimum en route IFR altitude. [Figure 2-62] When  applicable, MCAs are depicted on the en route chart. [Figure  2-59] MCAs are established in all cases where obstacles  intervene to prevent pilots from maintaining obstacle  clearance during a normal climb to a higher MEA after  passing a point beyond which the higher MEA applies. The  same protected en route area vertical obstacle clearance  requirements for the primary and secondary areas are  considered in the determination of the MCA. The standard  for determining the MCA is based upon the following climb  gradients and is computed from the flight altitude:  

•   Sea level through 5,000 feet MSL—150 feet per NM  •   5000 feet through 10,000 feet MSL—120 feet per  NM  •   10,000 feet MSL and over—100 feet per NM  

To determine the MCA seen on an en route chart, the  distance from the obstacle to the fix is computed from  the point where the centerline of the en route course in  the direction of flight intersects the farthest displacement  from the fix. [Figure 2-63] When a change of altitude is  involved with a course change, course guidance must be  provided if the change of altitude is more than 1,500 feet  and/or if the course change is more than   $45^{\circ}$  , although  there is an exception to this rule. In some cases, course  changes of up to   $90^{\circ}$   may be approved without course  guidance provided that no obstacles penetrate the  established MEA requirement of the previous airway or  route segment. Outside United States airspace, pilots may  encounter different flight procedures regarding MCA and  transitioning from one MEA to a higher MEA. In this case,  pilots are expected to be at the higher MEA crossing the  fix, similar to an MCA. Pilots must thoroughly review flight  procedure differences when flying outside United States  airspace. On IFR en route low altitude charts, routes and  associated data outside the conterminous United States  are shown for transitional purposes only and are not part  of the high altitude jet route and RNAV route systems.  [Figure 2-64]  

# Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)  

The MIA for operations is prescribed in 14 CFR Part 91. These  MIAs are published on aeronautical charts and prescribed  in 14 CFR Part 95 for airways and routes, and in  

14 CFR Part 97 for standard instrument approach  procedures. If no applicable minimum altitude is prescribed  

![](images/464cf24a1614e7c948900c18b7ba0f1fc51528c3b1a362f761e05fe645b3af09.jpg)

in 14 CFR Parts 95 or 97, the following MIA applies: In  designated mountainous areas, 2,000 feet above the  highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 NM  from the course to be flown; or other than mountainous  areas, 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a  horizontal distance of 4 NM from the course to be flown; or  as otherwise authorized by the Administrator or assigned  by ATC. MIAs are not flight checked for communication.  

# Minimum Vectoring Altitudes (MVA)  

MVAs are established for use by ATC when radar ATC is  exercised. The MVA provides 1,000 feet of clearance above  the highest obstacle in non-mountainous areas and 2,000  feet above the highest obstacle in designated mountainous  areas. Because of the ability to isolate specific obstacles,  some MVAs may be lower than MEAs, MOCAs, or other  minimum altitudes depicted on charts for a given location.  While being radar vectored, IFR altitude assignments by  ATC are normally at or above the MVA.  

Air traffic controllers use MVAs only when they are assured  an adequate radar return is being received from the aircraft.  Charts depicting MVAs are available to controllers and have  recently become available to pilots. They can be found  at  http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/  digital products/mva_mia/   Situational Awareness is

always important, especially when being radar vectored  during a climb into an area with progressively higher MVA  sectors, similar to the concept of MCA. Except where diverse  vector areas have been established, when climbing, pilots  should not be vectored into a sector with a higher MVA  unless at or above the next sector’s MVA. Where lower  MVAs are required in designated mountainous areas to  achieve compatibility with terminal routes or to permit  vectoring to an instrument approach procedure, 1,000 feet  of obstacle clearance may be authorized with the use of  Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR). The MVA provides at least  300 feet above the floor of controlled airspace. The MVA  charts are developed to the maximum radar range. Sectors  provide separation from terrain and obstructions. Each MVA  chart has sectors large enough to accommodate vectoring  of aircraft within the sector at the MVA. [Figure 2-65]  

# IFR Cruising Altitude or Flight Level  

In controlled airspace, pilots must maintain the altitude or  flight level assigned by ATC, although if the ATC clearance  assigns “VFR conditions on-top,” an altitude or flight level as  prescribed by 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.159 must be maintained.  In uncontrolled airspace (except while in a holding pattern  of two minutes or less or while turning) if operating an  aircraft under IFR in level cruising flight, an appropriate  altitude as depicted in the legend of IFR en route high  and low altitude charts must be maintained. [Figure 2-66]  

When operating on an IFR flight plan below 18,000 feet  MSL in accordance with a VFR-on-top clearance, any VFR  cruising altitude appropriate to the direction of flight  between the MEA and 18,000 feet MSL may be selected that  allows the flight to remain in VFR conditions. Any change in  altitude must be reported to ATC, and pilots must comply  with all other IFR reporting procedures. VFR-on-top is not  authorized in Class A airspace. When cruising below 18,000  feet MSL, the altimeter must be adjusted to the current  setting, as reported by a station within 100 NM of your  position. In areas where weather-reporting stations are  more than 100 NM from the route, the altimeter setting of  a station that is closest may be used.  

During IFR flight, ATC advises flights periodically of the  current altimeter setting, but it remains the responsibility  of the pilot or flight crew to update altimeter settings in a  timely manner. Altimeter settings and weather information  are available from weather reporting facilities operated or  approved by the U.S. National Weather Service, or a source  approved by the FAA. Some commercial operators have  the authority to act as a government-approved source of  weather information, including altimeter settings, through  certification under the FAA’s Enhanced Weather Information  System.  

Flight level operations at or above 18,000 feet MSL require  the altimeter to be set to 29.92 inches of mercury (" Hg). A  flight level (FL) is defined as a level of constant atmospheric  pressure related to a reference datum of 29.92 " Hg. Each  flight level is stated in three digits that represent hundreds of  feet. For example, FL 250 represents an altimeter indication  of 25,000 feet. Conflicts with traffic operating below 18,000  feet MSL may arise when actual altimeter settings along the  route of flight are lower than 29.92 " Hg. Therefore, 14 CFR  Part 91, § 91.121 specifies the lowest usable flight levels for  a given altimeter setting range.  

# Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RSVM)  

Reduced vertical separation minimums (RVSM) is a term  used to describe the reduction of the standard vertical  separation required between aircraft flying at levels  between FL 290 (29,000 feet) and FL 410 (41,000 feet)  from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet. The purpose; therefore,  increases the number of aircraft that can safely fly in a  particular volume of airspace. Historically, standard vertical  separation was 1,000 feet from the surface to FL 290, 2,000  feet from FL 290 to FL 410 and 4,000 feet above this. This  was because the accuracy of the pressure altimeter (used  to determine altitude) decreases with height. Over time,  air data computers (ADCs) combined with altimeters have  become more accurate and autopilots more adept at  maintaining a set level; therefore, it became apparent that  for many modern aircraft, the 2,000-foot separation was not  required . It was, therefore, proposed by ICAO that this be  reduced to 1,000 feet.  

Between 1997 and 2005, RVSM was implemented in all of  Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, South  America, and over the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and  Pacific Oceans. The North Atlantic implemented initially in  March 1997, at FL 330 through FL 370. The entire western  hemisphere implemented RVSM FL 290–FL  410 on January  20, 2005.  

Only aircraft with specially certified altimeters and  autopilots may fly in RVSM airspace, otherwise the aircraft  must fly lower or higher than the airspace, or seek special  exemption from the requirements. Additionally, aircraft  operators (airlines or corporate operators) must receive  specific approval from the aircraft’s state of registry in  order to conduct operations in RVSM airspace. Non-RVSM  approved aircraft may transit through RVSM airspace  provided they are given continuous climb throughout the  designated airspace, and 2,000 feet vertical separation is  provided at all times between the non-RVSM flight and all  others for the duration of the climb/descent.  

Critics of the change were concerned that by reducing  the space between aircraft, RVSM may increase the  number of mid-air collisions and conflicts. In the ten  years since RVSM was first implemented, not one  collision has been attributed to RVSM. In the United  States, this program was known as the Domestic  Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (DRVSM).  

# Cruise Clearance  

The term “cruise” may be used instead of “maintain” to  assign a block of airspace to an aircraft. The block extends  from the minimum IFR altitude up to and including the  altitude that is specified in the cruise clearance. On a cruise  clearance, you may level off at any intermediate altitude  within this block of airspace. You are allowed to climb or  descend within the block at your own discretion. However,  once you start descent and verbally report leaving an  altitude in the block to ATC, you may not return to that  altitude without an additional ATC clearance. A cruise  clearance also authorizes you to execute an approach at  the destination airport.  

# Lowest Usable Flight Level  

When the barometric pressure is   $31.00~"~\mathsf{H g}$   or less and  pilots are flying below 18,000 feet MSL, use the current  reported altimeter setting. When an aircraft is en route  on an instrument flight plan, air traffic controllers furnish  this information at least once while the aircraft is in the  controller’s area of jurisdiction. When the barometric  pressure exceeds 31.00 " Hg, the following procedures are  placed in effect by NOTAM defining the geographic area  affected: Set 31.00 " Hg for en route operations below  18,000 feet MSL and maintain this setting until beyond  the affected area. ATC issues actual altimeter settings and  advises pilots to set 31.00 " Hg in their altimeter, for en route  operations below 18,000 feet MSL in affected areas. If an  aircraft has the capability of setting the current altimeter  setting and operating into airports with the capability of  measuring the current altimeter setting, no additional  restrictions apply. At or above 18,000 feet MSL, altimeters  should be set to  $29.92~"\,\mathsf{H g}$   (standard setting). Additional  procedures exist beyond the en route phase of flight.  

The lowest usable flight level is determined by the  atmospheric pressure in the area of operation. As local  altimeter settings fall below   $29.92\ "\ {\sf H g},$   pilots operating  in Class A airspace must cruise at progressively higher  indicated altitudes to ensure separation from aircraft  

![](images/03c682c6462aedde2ccbc5dc291d1233281da7fe2045e47c0e42a01c027c51f5.jpg)

When the minimum altitude, as prescribed in 14 CFR Part  91, § 91.159 and 91.177, is above 18,000 feet MSL, the  lowest usable flight level is the flight level equivalent of  the minimum altitude plus the number of feet specified  according to the lowest flight level correction factor as  follows:

Altimeter Setting  Correction Factor  29.41 to 28.92  1,000 feet  28.91 to 28.42  1,500 feet  28.41 to 27.91  2,000 feet  27.91 to 27.42  2,500 feet  

Operations in Other Countries  

When flight crews transition from the U.S. NAS to another  country’s airspace, they should be aware of differences not  only in procedures but also airspace.  For example, when  flying into Canada as depicted in Figure 2-67, notice the  change from transition level (QNE) to transition altitude  (QNH) when flying north-bound into the Moncton flight  information region (FIR).  

Operations in international airspace demand that pilots  are aware of, and understand the use of, the three types  of altimeter settings. Most overseas airports give altimeter

settings in hectopascals (hPa) (millibars). Therefore, it is  imperative that pilots or on-board equipment are able  to accurately convert inches of mercury to hPa, or hPa to  inches of mercury.  

# Altitude Above Ground (QFE)  

A local altimeter setting equivalent to the barometric  pressure measured at an airport altimeter datum, usually  signifying the approach end of the runway is in use. At the  airport altimeter datum, an altimeter set to QFE indicates  zero altitude. If required to use QFE altimetry, altimeters  are set to QFE while operating at or below the transition  altitude and below the transition level. On the airport, the  altimeter will read  $"0"$  feet.  

# Barometric Pressure for Standard Altimeter  Setting (QNE)  

Use the altimeter setting (en route) at or above the  transition altitude (FL 180 in the United States). The  altimeter setting is always 29.92 inches of mercury/1013.2  hPa for a QNE altitude.  Transition levels differ from country  to country and pilots should be particularly alert when  making a climb or descent in a foreign area.  

# Barometric Pressure for Local Altimeter Setting  (QNH)  

pressure measured at an airport altimeter datum and  corrected to sea level pressure. At the airport altimeter  datum, an altimeter set to QNH indicates airport elevation  above mean sea level (MSL). Altimeters are set to QNH  while operating at and below the transition altitude and  below the transition level.  

For flights in the vicinity of airports, express the vertical  position of aircraft in terms of QNH or QFE at or below the  transition altitude and in terms of QNE at or above the  transition level. While passing through the transition layer,  express vertical position in terms of FLs when ascending  and in terms of altitudes when descending.  

When an aircraft that receives a clearance as number one  to land completes its approach using QFE, express the  vertical position of the aircraft in terms of height above  the airport elevation during that portion of its flight for  which you may use QFE.  

It is important to remember that most pressure altimeters  are subject to mechanical, elastic, temperature, and  installation errors.  In addition, extremely cold temperature  differences may also require altimeter correction factors  as appropriate.  

A local altimeter setting equivalent to the barometric  

# En Route Reporting Procedures  

In addition to acknowledging a handoff to another Center  en route controller, there are reports that should be made  without a specific request from ATC. Certain reports should  be made at all times regardless of whether a flight is in radar  contact with ATC, while others are necessary only if radar  contact has been lost or terminated. [Figure 2-68]  

# Non-Radar Position Reports  

If radar contact has been lost or radar service terminated,  the CFRs require pilots to provide ATC with position reports  over designated VORs and intersections along their route  of flight. These compulsory reporting points are depicted  on IFR en route charts by solid triangles. Position reports  over fixes indicated by open triangles are noncompulsory  reporting points and are only necessary when requested by  ATC. If on a direct course that is not on an established airway,  report over the fixes used in the flight plan that define  the route, since they automatically become compulsory  reporting points. Compulsory reporting points also apply  when conducting an IFR flight in accordance with a VFR- on-top clearance.  

Whether a route is on an airway or direct, position reports  are mandatory in a non-radar environment, and they  must include specific information. A typical position  report includes information pertaining to aircraft position,  expected route, and ETA. When a position report is to be  made passing a VOR radio facility, the time reported should  be the time at which the first complete reversal of the TO/  FROM indicator is accomplished. When a position report is  made passing a facility by means of an airborne ADF, the  time reported should be the time at which the indicator  makes a complete reversal. When an aural or a light panel  indication is used to determine the time passing a reporting  point, such as a fan marker, Z marker, cone of silence or  intersection of range courses, the time should be noted  when the signal is first received and again when it ceases.  The mean of these two times should then be taken as the  actual time over the fix. If a position is given with respect to  distance and direction from a reporting point, the distance  and direction should be computed as accurately as possible.  Except for terminal area transition purposes, position  reports or navigation with reference to aids not established  for use in the structure in which flight is being conducted  are not normally required by ATC.  

# Flights in a Radar Environment  

When informed by ATC that their aircraft are in “Radar  Contact,” pilots should discontinue position reports over  designated reporting points. They should resume normal  position reporting when ATC advises “radar contact lost”  or “radar service terminated.” ATC informs pilots that they  are in radar contact:  

1.  When their aircraft is initially identified in the  ATC system; and  2.  When radar identification is reestablished after  radar service has been terminated or radar  contact lost.  

Subsequent to being advised that the controller has  established radar contact, this fact is not repeated to  the pilot when handed off to another controller. At  times, the aircraft identity is confirmed by the receiving  controller; however, this should not be construed to  mean that radar contact has been lost. The identity of  transponder equipped aircraft is confirmed by asking  the pilot to “ident,” “squawk standby,” or to change  codes. Aircraft without transponders are advised of  their position to confirm identity. In this case, the pilot  is expected to advise the controller if in disagreement  with the position given. Any pilot who cannot confirm  the accuracy of the position given because of not being  tuned to the NAVAID referenced by the controller  should ask for another radar position relative to the  tuned in NAVAID.  

# Position Report Items  

Position reports should include the following items:  

1.  Aircraft  identification  2.   Position  3.   Time  4.  Altitude or flight level (include actual altitude  or flight level when operating on a clearance  specifying VFR-on-top)  5.  Type of flight plan (not required in IFR position  reports made directly to ARTCCs or approach  control)  6.  ETA and name of next reporting point  7.  The name only of the next succeeding reporting  point along the route of flight  8.  Pertinent remarks  

# Additional Reports  

The following reports should be made at all times to  ATC or Flight Service facilities without a specific ATC  request:  

1.  When vacating any previously assigned altitude  or flight level for a newly assigned altitude or  flight level.  2.  When an altitude change is made if operating  on a clearance specifying VFR-on-top.  

3.  When unable to climb/descend at a rate of a least  

4.  When approach has been missed. (Request clearance  for specific action (i.e., to alternative airport, another  approach).  5.  Change in the average true airspeed (at cruising  altitude) when it varies by 5 percent or 10 knots  (whichever is greater) from that filed in the flight  plan.  6.  The time and altitude or flight level upon reaching  a holding fix or point to which cleared.  7.  When leaving any assigned holding fix or point.    Note: The reports stated in subparagraphs 6 and  7 may be omitted by pilots of aircraft involved in  instrument training at military terminal area facilities  when radar service is being provided.  8.  Any loss, in controlled airspace, of VOR, TACAN,  ADF, low frequency navigation receiver capability,  GPS anomalies while using installed IFR-certified  GPS/GNSS receivers, complete or partial loss of ILS  receiver capability or impairment of air/ground  communications capability. Reports should include  aircraft identification, equipment affected, degree  to which the capability to operate under IFR in the  ATC system is impaired, and the nature and extent  of assistance desired from ATC.  

9.  Any information relating to the safety of flight.  

Other equipment installed in an aircraft may impair your  ability to safely operate under IFR.  If a malfunction of  such equipment (e.g., weather radar) affects any safety or  IFR capability, reports should be made as stated above.  When reporting GPS anomalies, be very specific and  include the location, altitude, and duration of the anomaly.  Deliberate GPS interference or outage areas resulting from  pre-approved government tests will be disseminated in  NOTAMs.  These outages should not be reported to ATC,  as this condition is known and not an anomaly.  See also  AIM 1-1-13.  

# Communication Failure  

Two-way radio communication failure procedures for IFR  operations are outlined in 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.185. Unless  otherwise authorized by ATC, pilots operating under IFR  are expected to comply with this regulation. Expanded  procedures for communication failures are found in the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Pilots can use the  transponder to alert ATC to a radio communication failure by  squawking code 7600. [Figure 2-69] If only the transmitter  is inoperative, listen for ATC instructions on any operational  receiver, including the navigation receivers. It is possible ATC  may try to make contact with pilots over a VOR, VORTAC,  NDB, or localizer frequency. In addition to monitoring  NAVAID receivers, attempt to reestablish communications  by contacting ATC on a previously assigned frequency or  calling an FSS.  

The primary objective of the regulations governing  communication failures is to preclude extended IFR  no-radio operations within the ATC system since these  operations may adversely affect other users of the airspace.  If the radio fails while operating on an IFR clearance, but  in VFR conditions, or if encountering VFR conditions at  any time after the failure, continue the flight under VFR  conditions, if possible, and land as soon as practicable. The  requirement to land as soon as practicable should not be  construed to mean as soon as possible. Pilots retain the  prerogative of exercising their best judgment and are not  required to land at an unauthorized airport, at an airport  unsuitable for the type of aircraft flown, or to land only  

![](images/653e19d23864f8f6f9ac20e354fc24fef135fa6644f3c403d619b91550213682.jpg)

minutes short of their intended destination. However, if  IFR conditions prevail, pilots must comply with procedures  designated in the CFRs to ensure aircraft separation.  If pilots must continue their flight under IFR after  experiencing two-way radio communication failure, they  should fly one of the following routes:  

•   The route assigned by ATC in the last clearance  received.  •   If being radar vectored, the direct route from the  point of radio failure to the fix, route, or airway  specified in the radar vector clearance.  •   In the absence of an assigned route, the route ATC  has advised to expect in a further clearance.  •   In the absence of an assigned or expected route, the  route filed in the flight plan.  

It is also important to fly a specific altitude should two-way  radio communications be lost. The altitude to fly after a  communication failure can be found in 14 CFR Part 91, §  91.185 and must be the highest of the following altitudes  for each route segment flown.  

•   The altitude or flight level assigned in the last ATC  clearance.  •   The minimum altitude or flight level for IFR  operations.  •   The altitude or flight level ATC has advised to expect  in a further clearance.  

In some cases, the assigned or expected altitude may not be as  high as the MEA on the next route segment. In this situation,  pilots normally begin a climb to the higher MEA when they  reach the fix where the MEA rises. If the fix also has a published  MCA, they start the climb so they are at or above the MCA  when reaching the fix. If the next succeeding route segment  has a lower MEA, descend to the applicable altitude either  the last assigned altitude or the altitude expected in a further  clearance—when reaching the fix where the MEA decreases.  

# ARTCC Radio Frequency Outage  

ARTCCs normally have at least one back-up radio receiver  and transmitter system for each frequency that can usually  be placed into service quickly with little or no disruption of  ATC service. Occasionally, technical problems may cause a  delay but switchover seldom takes more than 60 seconds.  When it appears that the outage is not quickly remedied,  the ARTCC usually requests a nearby aircraft, if there is  one, to switch to the affected frequency to broadcast  communications instructions. It is important that the pilot  wait at least one minute before deciding that the ARTCC has  actually experienced a radio frequency failure. When such  an outage does occur, the pilot should, if workload and  equipment capability permit, maintain a listening watch  on the affected frequency while attempting to comply with  the following recommended communications procedures:  

1.  If two-way communications cannot be established  with the ARTCC after changing frequencies, a pilot  should attempt to re-contact the transferring  controller for the assignment of an alternative  frequency or other instructions.  

2.  When an ARTCC radio frequency failure occurs after  two-way communications have been established,  the pilot should attempt to reestablish contact with  the center on any other known ARTCC frequency,  preferably that of the next responsible sector when  practicable, and ask for instructions. However,  when the next normal frequency change along  the route is known to involve another ATC facility,  the pilot should contact that facility, if feasible,  

for instructions. If communications cannot be  reestablished by either method, the pilot is expected  to request communication instructions from the FSS  appropriate to the route of flight.  

Note: The exchange of information between an aircraft  and an ARTCC through an FSS is quicker than relay via  company radio because the FSS has direct interphone  lines to the responsible ARTCC sector. Accordingly,  when circumstances dictate a choice between the two  during an ARTCC frequency outage relay via FSS radio is  recommended.  

# Climbing and Descending En Route  

When ATC issues a clearance or instruction, pilots are  expected to execute its provisions upon receipt. In some  cases, ATC includes words that modify their expectation.  For example, the word “immediately” in a clearance or  instruction is used to impress urgency to avoid an imminent  situation, and expeditious compliance is expected and  necessary for safety. The addition of a climb point or time  restriction, for example, does not authorize pilots to deviate  from the route of flight or any other provision of the ATC  clearance. If the pilot receives the term “climb at pilot’s  discretion” in the altitude information of an ATC clearance,  it means that the pilot has the option to start a climb when  they desire and are authorized to climb at any rate, and to  temporarily level off at any intermediate altitude as desired,  although once you vacate an altitude, you may not return to  that altitude. When ATC has not used the term nor imposed  any climb restrictions, pilots should climb promptly on  acknowledgment of the clearance. Climb at an optimum  rate consistent with the operating characteristics of the  aircraft to 1,000 feet below the assigned altitude, and then  attempt to climb at a rate of between 500 and 1,500 fpm  until the assigned altitude is reached. If at any time the  pilot is unable to climb at a rate of at least 500 fpm, advise  ATC. If it is necessary to level off at an intermediate altitude  during climb, advise ATC.  

When ATC issues the instruction, “Expedite climb,” this  normally indicates that the pilot should use the approximate  best rate of climb without an exceptional change in aircraft  handling characteristics. Normally controllers inform pilots  of the reason for an instruction to expedite. If flying a  turbojet aircraft equipped with afterburner engines, such as  a military aircraft, pilots should advise ATC prior to takeoff  if intending to use afterburning during the climb to the en  route altitude. Often, the controller may be able to plan  traffic to accommodate a high performance climb and allow  the pilot to climb to the planned altitude without “expedite”  clearance from restriction. If you receive an ATC instruction,  and your altitude to maintain is subsequently changed  or restated without an expedite instruction, the expedite  During en route climb, as in any other phase of flight,  it is essential that you clearly communicate with ATC  regarding clearances. In the following example, a flight crew  experienced an apparent clearance readback/hearback  error, that resulted in confusion about the clearance and,  ultimately, to inadequate separation from another aircraft.  “Departing IFR, clearance was to maintain 5,000 feet,  expect 12,000 in 10 minutes.” After handoff to Center, the  pilot understood and read back, “Leaving 5,000 turn left  heading   $240^{\circ}$   for vector on course.” The pilot turned to the  assigned heading climbing through 5,000 feet. At 5,300 feet,  Center advised assigned altitude was 5,000 feet. The pilot  immediately descended to 5,000. Center then informed  the pilot that there was traffic at 12 o’clock and a mile at  6,000. After passing traffic, a higher altitude was assigned  and climb resumed. The pilot then believed the clearance  was probably "reaching" 5,000, etc. Even the readback to the  controller with "leaving" did not catch the different wording.  “Reaching” and “leaving” are commonly used ATC terms  having different usages. They may be used in clearances  involving climbs, descents, turns, or speed changes. In the  flight deck, the words “reaching” and “leaving” sound much  alike.  

For altitude awareness during climb, pilots often call out  altitudes on the flight deck. The pilot monitoring may call  2,000 and 1,000 feet prior to reaching an assigned altitude.  The callout may be, “two” climbing through the transit  to go altitude (QNH), both pilots set their altimeters to 

 29.92 inches of mercury and announce  $"2992$   inches” (or 

 ‘standard,’ on some aircraft) and the flight level passing.  For example,  $^{\prime\prime}2992$   inches” (standard), flight level one  eight zero. The second officer on three pilot crews may  ensure that both pilots have inserted the proper altimeter  setting. On international flights, pilots must be prepared  to differentiate, if necessary, between barometric pressure  equivalents with inches of mercury, and millibars or  hectopascals, to eliminate any potential for error. For  example, 996 millibars erroneously being set as 2996.  

For a typical IFR flight, the majority of in-flight time often  is flown in level flight at cruising altitude from top of climb  (TOC) to top of descent (TOD). Generally, TOD is used in  airplanes with a FMS and represents the point at which  descent is first initiated from cruise altitude. FMS also  assist in level flight by cruising at the most fuel saving  speed, providing continuing guidance along the flight plan  route including great circle direct routes, and continuous  evaluation and prediction of fuel consumption along with  changing clearance data.

# Aircraft Speed and Altitude  

During the en route descent phase of flight, an additional  benefit a FMS is that it provides fuel saving idle thrust  descent to your destination airport. This allows an  uninterrupted profile descent from level cruising altitude  to an appropriate MIA, except where level flight is required  for speed adjustment.  Controllers anticipate and plan that  

![](images/8176e0830aff03da4c22746f26f18eee81ab19a045bb60da71871b763ed742c7.jpg)  
Figure 2-72.  Clearance limit holding.  

the pilot may level off at 10,000 feet MSL on descent to  comply with the 14 CFR Part 91 indicated airspeed limit of  250 knots. Leveling off at any other time on descent may  seriously affect air traffic handling by ATC. It is imperative  that pilots make every effort to fulfill ATC expected actions  on descent to aid in safely handling and expediting air  traffic.  

ATC issues speed adjustments if the flight is being radar  controlled to achieve or maintain required or desired  spacing. They express speed adjustments in terms of knots  based on indicated airspeed in 10 knot increments except  that at or above FL 240 speeds may be expressed in terms  of Mach numbers in 0.01 increments. The use of Mach  numbers by ATC is restricted to turbojets. If complying  with speed adjustments, pilots are expected to maintain  that speed within plus or minus 10 knots or 0.02 Mach.  

Speed and altitude restrictions in clearances are subject  to misinterpretation, as evidenced in this case where a  corporate flight crew treated instructions in a published  procedure as a clearance. The aircraft was at FL 310 and  had already programmed the ‘expect-crossing altitude’ of  

![](images/1881a57a51de857fd52d2d818b6a1c052e7811cd6ad806911fb81d83176b3640.jpg)

17,000 feet at the VOR. When the altitude alerter sounded,  the pilot advised Center that we were leaving FL 310. ATC  acknowledged with a “Roger.” At FL 270, Center questioned  the pilot about the aircrafts descent. The pilot told the  controller that the reason for the descent was to cross the  VOR at 17,000 feet. ATC advised the pilot that he did not  have clearance to descend. What the pilot thought was a  clearance was in fact an “expect”clearance. Whenever pilots  are in doubt about a clearance it is imperative they request  clarity from ATC. Also, the term “Roger” only means that ATC  received the transmission, not that they understood the  transmission. “Expect” altitudes are published for planning  purposes and are not considered crossing restrictions until  verbally issued by ATC.  

# En Route Holding Procedures  

The criteria for holding pattern airspace is developed  both to provide separation of aircraft, as well as obstacle  clearance. The alignment of holding patterns typically  coincides with the flight course you fly after leaving the  holding fix. For level holding, a minimum of 1,000 feet  obstacle clearance is provided throughout the primary  area. In the secondary area, 500 feet of obstacle clearance  is provided at the inner edge, tapering to zero feet at the  outer edge. Allowance for precipitous terrain is considered,  and the altitudes selected for obstacle clearance may be  rounded to the nearest 100 feet. When criteria for a climb  in hold are applied, no obstacle penetrates the holding  surface. [Figure 2-70]  

There are many factors that affect aircraft during holding  maneuvers, including navigational aid ground and airborne  tolerance, effect of wind, flight procedures, application of  ATC, outbound leg length, maximum holding airspeeds,  fix to NAVAID distance, DME slant range effect, holding  airspace size, and altitude holding levels.  

# ATC Holding Instructions  

When controllers anticipate a delay at a clearance limit or  fix, pilots are usually issued a holding clearance at least  five minutes before the ETA at the clearance limit or fix. If  the holding pattern assigned by ATC is depicted on the  appropriate aeronautical chart, pilots are expected to  hold as charted. In the following example, the controller  issues a holding clearance that includes the name of the  fix, directs the pilot to hold as charted, and includes an  expect further clearance (EFC) time. “Marathon five sixty  four, hold east of MIKEY Intersection as published, expect  further clearance at 1521.”  

When ATC issues a clearance requiring you to hold at a fix  where a holding pattern is not charted, pilots are issued  complete holding instructions. The holding instructions  include the direction from the fix, name of the fix, course,  leg length, if appropriate, direction of turns (if left turns  are required), and the EFC time. Pilots are required to  maintain the last assigned altitude unless a new altitude is  specifically included in the holding clearance and should  fly right turns unless left turns are assigned. Note that all  holding instructions should include an EFC time. In the  event that two-way radio communication is lost, the EFC  allows the pilot to depart the holding fix at a definite time.  Pilots should plan the last lap of the holding pattern to  leave the fix as close as possible to the exact time. [Figure  2-71]  

When approaching the clearance limit and you have  not received holding instructions from ATC, pilots are  expected to follow certain procedures. First, call ATC  and request further clearance before reaching the fix. If  further clearance cannot be obtained, pilots are expected  to hold at the fix in compliance with the charted holding  pattern. If a holding pattern is not charted at the fix, pilots  are expected to hold on the inbound course using right  turns. This procedure ensures that ATC provides adequate  separation. [Figure 2-72] For example, the aircraft is heading  eastbound on V214 and the Cherrelyn VORTAC is the  clearance limit and the pilot has not been able to obtain  further clearance and has not received holding instructions,  plan to hold southwest on the  $221^{\circ}$   radial using left-hand  turns, as depicted. If this holding pattern is not charted,  hold west of the VOR on V214 using right-hand turns.  

Where required for aircraft separation, ATC may request  that the pilot hold at any designated reporting point in a  standard holding pattern at the MEA or the MRA, whichever  altitude is the higher at locations where a minimum holding  altitude has not been established. Unplanned holding at  en route fixes may be expected on airway or route radials,  bearings, or courses. If the fix is a facility, unplanned  holding could be on any radial or bearing and there may  be holding limitations required if standard holding cannot  be accomplished at the MEA or MRA.  

# Maximum Holding Speed  

The size of the holding pattern is directly proportional  to the speed of the aircraft. In order to limit the amount  of airspace that must be protected by ATC, maximum  holding speeds in knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) have  been designated for specific altitude ranges. [Figure 2-73]  Even so, some holding patterns may have additional speed  restrictions to keep faster aircraft from flying out of the  protected area. If a holding pattern has a nonstandard  speed restriction, it is depicted by an icon with the limiting  airspeed. If the holding speed limit is less than the pilot feels  necessary, advise ATC of the revised holding speed. Also, if  the indicated airspeed exceeds the applicable maximum  holding speed, ATC expects the pilot to slow to the speed  limit within three minutes of the ETA at the holding fix.  Often pilots can avoid flying a holding pattern, or reduce  the length of time spent in the holding pattern, by slowing  down on the way to the holding fix.  

# High Performance Holding  

When operating at higher airspeeds, there are certain  limitations that must be adhered to. For example, aircraft  do not make standard rate turns in holding patterns if the  bank angle exceeds   $30^{\circ}$  . If your aircraft is using a flight  director system, the bank angle is limited to  $25^{\circ}$  . The aircraft  must be traveling over 210 knots true airspeed (TAS) for the  bank angle in a standard rate turn to exceed  $30^{\circ},$  ; therefore,  this limit applies to relatively fast aircraft. An aircraft using  a flight director would have to be holding at more than  170 knots TAS to come up against the  $25^{\circ}$   limit. These true  airspeeds correspond to indicated airspeeds of about 183  and 156 knots, respectively, at 6,000 feet in a standard  atmosphere.  

# En Route Safety Considerations  

# Fuel State Awareness  

in the flight plan. Generally, TOC is used in aircraft with an  FMS, and represents the point at which cruise altitude is first  reached. TOC is calculated based on current altitude, climb  speed, and cruise altitude. The pilot may elect to delete the  additional waypoint recording requirement if the flight is  so short that the record will not assist in the management  of the flight. For flights scheduled for more than one hour,  the pilot may record the time and fuel remaining shortly  after TOC and at selected waypoints listed in the flight plan,  conveniently spaced approximately one hour apart. The  actual fuel burn is then compared to the planned fuel burn.  Each fuel tank must be monitored to verify proper burn  off and appropriate fuel remaining. For two-pilot aircraft,  the pilot monitoring (PM) keeps the flight plan record. On  three-pilot aircraft, the second officer and PM coordinate  recording and keeping the flight plan record. In all cases,  the crew member(s) making the recording communicates  the information to the pilot flying.  

# Diversion Procedures  

OpSpecs for commercial operators include provisions for en  route emergency diversion airport requirements. Operators  are expected to develop a sufficient set of emergency  diversion airports, so that one or more can be reasonably  expected to be available in varying weather conditions.  The flight must be able to make a safe landing, and the  airplane maneuvered off of the runway at the selected  diversion airport. In the event of a disabled airplane  following landing, the capability to move the disabled  airplane must exist so as not to block the operation of any  recovery aircraft. In addition, those airports designated  for use must be capable of protecting the safety of all  personnel by being able to:  

•   Offload the passengers and flight crew in a safe  manner during possible adverse weather conditions.  •   Provide for the physiological needs of the passengers  and flight crew for the duration until safe evacuation.  •   Be able to safely extract passengers and flight crew  as soon as possible. Execution and completion of the  recovery is expected within 12 to 48 hours following  diversion.  

Part 91 operators also need to be prepared for a diversion.  Designation of an alternate on the IFR flight plan is a good  first step; but changing weather conditions or equipment  issues may require pilots to consider other options.  

In order to increase fuel state awareness, pilots are required  to monitor the time and fuel remaining during an IFR flight.  For example, on a flight scheduled for one hour or less, the  flight crew may record the time and fuel remaining at the  top of climb (TOC) and at one additional waypoint listed  

# Chapter 3  

# Arrivals  

# Introduction  

Preparation for the arrival and approach begins long  before the descent from the en route phase of flight.  Planning early, while there are fewer demands on the  pilot’s attention, leaves the pilot free to concentrate on  precise control of the aircraft and better equipped to deal  with problems that might arise during the last segment  of the flight.  

This chapter focuses on the current procedures pilots and  air traffic control (ATC) use for instrument flight rule (IFR)  arrivals in the National Airspace System (NAS). The objective  is to provide pilots with an understanding of ATC arrival  procedures and pilot responsibilities as they relate to the  transition between the en route and approach phases of  flight. This chapter emphasizes standard terminal arrival  routes (STARs), descent clearances, descent planning, and  ATC procedures, while the scope of coverage focuses on  transitioning from the en route phase of flight, typically  the origination point of a STAR to the STAR termination fix.  

Optimum IFR arrival options include flying directly from the  en route structure to an approach gate or initial approach  fix (IAF), a visual arrival, STARs, and radar vectors. Within  controlled airspace, ATC routinely uses radar vectors for  separation purposes, noise abatement considerations  when it is an operational advantage, or when requested by  pilots. Vectors outside of controlled airspace are provided  only on pilot request. The controller tells the pilot the  purpose of the vector when the vector is controller-initiated  and takes the aircraft off a previously assigned non-radar  route. Typically, when operating on area navigation  (RNAV) routes, pilots are allowed to remain on their own  navigation.  

# Navigation in the Arrival Environment  

The most significant and demanding navigational  requirement is the need to safely separate aircraft. In a  non-radar environment, ATC does not have an independent  means to separate air traffic and must depend entirely on  information relayed from flight crews to determine the  actual geographic position and altitude. In this situation,  precise navigation is critical to ATC’s ability to provide  separation.  

Even in a radar environment, precise navigation and  position reports, when required, are still a  primary means  of providing separation. In most situations, ATC does not  have the capability or the responsibility for navigating  an aircraft. Because they rely on precise navigation by  the flight crew, flight safety in all IFR operations depends  directly on the pilot’s ability to achieve and maintain  certain levels of navigational performance. ATC uses radar  to monitor navigational performance, detect possible  navigational errors, and expedite traffic flow. In a non- radar environment, ATC has no independent knowledge  of the actual position of the aircraft or its relationship to  other aircraft in adjacent airspace. Therefore, ATC’s ability  to detect a navigational error and resolve collision hazards  is seriously degraded when a deviation from a clearance  occurs.  

The concept of navigation performance, previously  discussed in this book, involves the precision that must  be maintained for both the assigned route and altitude.  Required levels of navigation performance vary from area  to area depending on traffic density and complexity of  the routes flown. The level of navigation performance  must be more precise in domestic airspace than in oceanic  and remote land areas since air traffic density in domestic  airspace is much greater. For example, there are three  million flight operations conducted within Chicago Center’s  airspace each year. The minimum lateral distance permitted  between co-altitude aircraft in Chicago Center’s airspace  is eight nautical miles (NM) (3 NM when radar is used).  The route ATC assigns an aircraft has protected airspace  on both sides of the centerline, equal to one-half of the  lateral separation minimum standard. For example, the  overall level of lateral navigation performance necessary for  flight safety must be better than 4 NM in Center airspace.  When STARs are reviewed subsequently in this chapter, it is  demonstrated how the navigational requirements become  more restrictive in the arrival phase of flight where air traffic  density increases and procedural design and obstacle  clearance become more limiting.  

The concept of navigational performance is fundamental to  the code of federal regulations and is best defined in Title  14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Part 121, §  121.103 and 121.121, which state that each aircraft must  be navigated to the degree of accuracy required for ATC.  The requirements of 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.123 related to  compliance with ATC clearances and instructions also  reflect this fundamental concept. Commercial operators  must comply with their Operations Specifications  (OpSpecs) and understand the categories of navigational  operations and be able to navigate to the degree of  accuracy required for the control of air traffic.  

In the broad concept of air navigation, there are two major  categories of navigational operations consisting of Class  I navigation and Class II navigation. Class I navigation is  any en route flight operation conducted in controlled or  uncontrolled airspace that is entirely within operational  service volumes of International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) standard navigational aids (NAVAIDs) (very high  frequency (VHF) omnidirectional radio range (VOR), VOR/  distance measuring equipment (DME), non-directional  beacon (NDB), etc.).  

Class II navigation is any en route operation that is not  categorized as Class I navigation and includes any operation  or portion of an operation that takes place outside the  operational service volumes of ICAO standard NAVAIDs.  For example, aircraft equipped only with VORs conducts  Class II navigation when the flight operates in an area  outside the operational service volumes of federal VORs.  Class II navigation does not automatically require the  use of long-range, specialized navigational systems if  special navigational techniques are used to supplement  conventional NAVAIDs. Class II navigation includes  transoceanic operations and operations in desolate and  remote land areas, such as the Arctic. The primary types  of specialized navigational systems approved for Class II  operations include inertial navigation system (INS), Doppler,  and global positioning system (GPS). Figure 3-1 provides  several examples of Class I and II navigation.  

# Descent Planning  

Planning the descent from cruise is important because of  the need to dissipate altitude and airspeed in order to arrive  at the approach gate properly configured. Descending early  results in more flight at low altitudes with increased fuel  consumption, and starting down late results in problems  controlling both airspeed and descent rates on the  approach. Prior to flight, pilots need to calculate the fuel,  time, and distance required to descend from the cruising  altitude to the approach gate altitude for the specific  instrument approach at the destination airport. While  in flight prior to the descent, it is important for pilots to  verify landing weather to include winds at their intended  destination. Inclimate weather at the destination airport can  cause slower descents and missed approaches that require  a sufficient amount of fuel that should be calculated prior to  starting the descent. In order to plan the descent, the pilot  needs to know the cruise altitude, approach gate altitude  or initial approach fix altitude, descent groundspeed, and

# NOTE:  

The area encompassed by the cylinders represents the volume of airspace within the operational service volume  (OSV) of ICAO standard NAVAIDs. The altitude of your aircraft with respect to the location of the NAVAID is a  primary factor in determining OSV range.”  

Your aircraft navigating from A to B is conducting Class I navigation because you remain within the OSV of  Route 1  ICAO standard NAVAIDs during your entire flight.  

#  

You are conducting Class II navigation during the portion of your route outside the OSV of the NAVAIDs.  Because the duration of the Class II navigation is 1 hour or less, long-range navigation equipment or a flight  navigator may not be required.

You are conducting Class II navigation when outside the OSV of the NAVAIDs. The duration of the Class II  navigation is more than 1 hour. Therefore, long-range navigation equipment or a flight navigator is required.  

descent rate. This information must be updated while  in flight for changes in altitude, weather, and wind. The  approach gate is an imaginary point used by ATC to vector  aircraft to the final approach course. The approach gate  is established along the final approach course 1 NM from  the final approach fix (FAF) on the side away from the  airport and is located no closer than 5 NM from the landing  threshold. Flight manuals or operating handbooks may also  contain a fuel, time, and distance to descend chart that  contains the same information.  

One technique that is often used is the descent rule of  thumb, which is used to determine when you need to  descend in terms of the number of miles prior to the point  at which you desire to arrive at your new altitude. First,  divide the altitude needed to be lost by 300. For example,  if cruising altitude is 7,000 feet and you want to get down  to a pattern altitude of 1,000 feet. The altitude you want to  lose is 6,000 feet, which when divided by 300 results in 20.  Therefore, you need to start your descent 20 NM out and  leave some extra room so that you are at pattern altitude  prior to the proper entry. It is also necessary to know what  rate-of-descent (ROD) to use.  

To determine ROD for a three-degree path, simply multiply  your groundspeed by 5. If you are going 120 knots, your  ROD to fly the desired path would be 600 fpm (  $120\times5$   $=600)$  ). It was determined in the previous example that a  descent should be initiated at 20 NM to lose 6,000 feet. If  the groundspeed is 120 knots, that means the aircraft is  moving along at 2 NM per minute. So to go 20 NM, it takes  10 minutes. Ten minutes at 600 fpm means you will lose  6,000 feet.  

The calculations should be made before the flight and rules  of thumb updates should be applied in flight. For example,  from the charted STAR pilots might plan a descent based on  an expected clearance to “cross 40 DME West of Brown VOR  at  $_{6,000^{\prime\prime}}$   and then apply rules of thumb for slowing down  from 250 knots. These might include planning airspeed at 25  NM from the runway threshold to be 250 knots, 200 knots at   $20\,\mathsf{N M},$  , and 150 knots at 15 NM until gear and flap speeds  are reached, never to fall below approach speed.  

# Vertical Navigation (VNAV) Planning  

Vertical navigation (VNAV) is the vertical component of  the flight plan. This approach path is computed from the  top-of- descent (TOD) point down to the end-of-descent  waypoint (E/D), which is generally the runway or missed  approach point, which is slightly different than to the  approach gate for non-flight management system (FMS)  equipped aircraft. [Figure 3-2] The VNAV path is computed  based upon the aircraft performance, approach constraints,  weather data (winds, temperature, icing conditions, etc.)  and aircraft weight.

Figure 3-4.  VNAV geometric path.  

The two types of VNAV paths that the FMS use is either a  performance path or a geometric path. The performance  path is computed using at idle or near idle power from  the TOD to the first constrained waypoint. [Figure 3-3]  The geometric path is computed from point to point  between two constrained waypoints or when on an  assigned vertical angle. The geometric path is shallower  than the performance path and is typically a non-idle  path. [Figure 3-4]  

# LNAV/VNAV Equipment  

Lateral navigation/vertical navigation (LNAV/VNAV)  equipment is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS)  in that it provides both lateral and vertical approach course  guidance. Since precise vertical position information is  beyond the current capabilities of the GPS, approaches with  LNAV/VNAV minimums make use of certified barometric  VNAV (baro-VNAV) systems for vertical guidance and/or  the wide area augmentation system (WAAS) to improve  GPS accuracy for this purpose.  

![](images/83aeec9d74bf1526501e85b30d8cfef7e70126b8dd705a06f248cf8fa6669ef7.jpg)  

Figure 3-5.  WAAS data provide lateral and vertical guidance.  

Note:  WAAS makes use of a collection of ground stations  that are used to detect and correct inaccuracies in the  position information derived from the GPS. Using WAAS,  the accuracy of vertical position information is increased  to within three meters.  

To make use of WAAS; however, the aircraft must be  equipped with an IFR-approved GPS receiver with WAAS  signal reception that integrates WAAS error correction  signals into its position determining processing. The WAAS  enabled GPS receiver [Figure 3-5] allows the pilot to load an  RNAV approach and receive guidance along the lateral and  vertical profile shown on the approach chart. [Figure 3-6]  It is very important to know what kind of equipment is  installed in an aircraft, and what it is approved to do. It is  also important to understand that the VNAV function of  non-WAAS capable or non-WAAS equipped IFR-approved  GPS receivers does not make the aircraft capable of flying  approaches to LNAV/VNAV minimums.  

FMS are the primary tool for most modern aircraft, air  carriers, and any operators requiring performance based  navigation. Most of the modern FMS are fully equipped  with LNAV/VNAV and WAAS. The FMS provides flight control  steering and thrust guidance along the VNAV path. Some  less integrated systems may only advise the flight crew  of the VNAV path but have no auto-throttle capability.  These less integrated systems require an increase in pilot  workload during the arrival/approach phase in order to  maintain the descent path.  

# Descent Planning for High Performance Aircraft  

The need to plan the IFR descent into the approach gate  and airport environment during the preflight planning  stage of flight is particularly important for turbojets. TOD  from the en route phase of flight for high performance  aircraft is often used in this process and is calculated  manually or automatically through a FMS based upon the  altitude of the approach gate. A general rule of thumb for  initial IFR descent planning in jets is the 3 to 1 formula.  This means that it takes 3 NM to descend 1,000 feet. If  an airplane is at FL 310 and the approach gate or initial  approach fix is at 6,000 feet, the initial descent requirement  equals 25,000 feet (31,000–6,000). Multiplying 25 times  3 equals 75; therefore, begin descent 75 NM from the  approach gate, based on a normal jet airplane, idle thrust,  speed Mach 0.74 to 0.78, and vertical speed of 1,800–2,200  fpm. For a tailwind adjustment, add 2 NM for each 10 knots  of tailwind. For a headwind adjustment, subtract 2 NM for  each 10 knots of headwind. During the descent planning  stage, try to determine which runway is in use at the  destination airport, either by reading the latest aviation  routine weather report (METAR) or checking the automatic  terminal information service (ATIS) information. There can  be big differences in distances depending on the active  runway and STAR. The objective is to determine the most  economical point for descent.  

An example of a typical jet descent-planning chart is  depicted in Figure 3-7. Item 1 is the pressure altitude from  which the descent begins; item 2 is the time required  for the descent in minutes; item 3 is the amount of fuel  consumed in pounds during descent to sea level; and item  4 is the distance covered in NM. Item 5 shows that the chart  is based on a Mach .80 airspeed until 280 knots indicated  airspeed (KIAS) is obtained. The 250 knot airspeed limitation  

![](images/ee89cb2a44109586f0eb35192392cecd7e254e701ecac02c9ca04d47687a1c4d.jpg)

Figure 3-7.  Jet descent task.  

below 10,000 feet MSL is not included on the chart, since its  effect is minimal. Also, the effect of temperature or weight  variation is negligible and is therefore omitted.  

Due to the increased flight deck workload, pilots should  get as much done ahead of time as possible. As with the  climb and cruise phases of flight, aircrews should consult  the proper performance charts to compute their fuel  requirements, as well as the time and distance needed for  their descent.  

During the cruise and descent phases of flight, pilots  need to monitor and manage the aircraft according to  the appropriate manufacturer’s recommendations. Flight  manuals and operating handbooks contain cruise and  descent checklists, performance charts for specific cruise  configurations, and descent charts that provide information  regarding the fuel, time, and distance required to descend.  Aircrews should review this information prior to the  departure of every flight so they have an understanding of  how the aircraft is supposed to perform at cruise and during  descent. A stabilized descent constitutes a preplanned  maneuver in which the power is properly set, and minimum  control input is required to maintain the appropriate  descent path. Excessive corrections or control inputs  indicate the descent was improperly planned. Plan the IFR  descent from cruising altitude so that the aircraft arrives at  the approach gate altitude or initial approach fix altitude  prior to beginning the instrument approach. For example,  suppose you are asked to descend from 11,000 feet to  meet a crossing restriction at 3,000 feet. [Figure 3-8] Since  there is a 200 knot speed restriction while approaching  the destination airport, you choose a descent speed of  190 knots and a descent rate of 1,000 fpm. Assuming a 10  knot headwind component, groundspeed in the descent  is 180 knots.  

# Descending From the En Route Altitude  

Making the transition from cruise flight to the beginning  of an instrument approach procedure sometimes requires  arriving at a given waypoint at an assigned altitude. When  this requirement is prescribed by a published arrival  procedure or issued by ATC, it is called a crossing restriction.  Even when ATC allows a descent at the pilot’s discretion,  

![](images/3f6eed6aaae81f2a5698ad5415804616ce10858d1ae80b5a088972de76efd9d1.jpg)  
Figure 3-8.  The descent planning task.  

aircrews need to choose a waypoint and altitude for  positioning convenient to start the approach. In either case,  descending from a cruising altitude to a given waypoint or  altitude requires both planning and precise flying.  

ATC may ask the pilot to descend to and maintain a  specific altitude. Generally, this clearance is for en route  traffic separation purposes, and pilots need to respond to  it promptly. Descend at the optimum rate for the aircraft  being flown until 1,000 feet above the assigned altitude,  then descend at a rate between 500 and 1,500 fpm to the  assigned altitude. If at any time, other than when slowing  to 250 KIAS at 10,000 feet MSL, the pilot cannot descend  at a rate of at least 500 fpm, advise ATC.  

The second type of clearance allows the pilot to descend  “… at pilot’s discretion.” When ATC issues a clearance to  descend at pilot’s discretion, pilots may begin the descent  whenever they choose and at any rate of their choosing.  Pilots are also authorized to level off, temporarily, at any  intermediate altitude during the descent. However, once  the aircraft leaves an altitude, it may not return to that  altitude.  

A descent clearance may also include a segment where the  descent is at the pilots’ discretion—such as “cross the Joliet  VOR at or above 12,000, descend and maintain 5,000.”This  clearance authorizes pilots to descend from their current  altitude whenever they choose, as long as they cross the  Joliet VOR at or above 12,000 feet MSL. After that, they are  expected to descend at a normal rate until they reach the  assigned altitude of 5,000 feet MSL.  

Clearances to descend at pilots’ discretion are not just an  option for ATC. Pilots may also request this type of clearance  so that they can operate more efficiently. For example, if  a pilot was en route above an overcast layer, he or she  might ask for a descent at his or her discretion to allow the  aircraft to remain above the clouds for as long as possible.  This might be particularly important if the atmosphere  is conducive to icing and the aircraft’s icing protection  is limited. The pilot’s  request permits the aircraft to stay  at its cruising altitude longer to conserve fuel or to avoid  prolonged IFR flight in icing conditions. This type of descent  can also help to minimize the time spent in turbulence by  allowing pilots to level off at an altitude where the air is  smoother.  

# Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)  

Inappropriate descent planning and execution during  arrivals has been a contributing factor to many fatal  aircraft accidents. Since the beginning of commercial jet  operations, more than 9,000 people have died worldwide  because of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). CFIT is  described as an event in which a normally functioning  aircraft is inadvertently flown into the ground, water, or an  obstacle. Of all CFIT accidents, 7.2 percent occurred during  the descent phase of flight.  

The basic causes of CFIT accidents involve poor flight crew  situational awareness, or SA. One definition of SA is an  accurate perception by pilots of the factors and conditions  currently affecting the safe operation of the aircraft and the  crew. The causes of CFIT are the flight crews’ lack of vertical  position awareness or their lack of horizontal position  awareness in relation to the ground, water, or an obstacle.  More than two-thirds of all CFIT accidents are the result  of an altitude error or lack of vertical SA. CFIT accidents  most often occur during reduced visibility associated with  instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), darkness, or  a combination of both.  

The inability of controllers and pilots to properly  communicate has been a factor in many CFIT accidents.  Heavy workloads can lead to hurried communication and  the use of abbreviated or non-standard phraseology. The  importance of good communication during the arrival  phase of flight was made evident in a report by an air traffic  controller and the flight crew of an MD-80.  

The controller reported that he was scanning his radarscope  for traffic and noticed that the MD-80 was descending  through 6,400 feet. He immediately instructed a climb  to at least 6,500 feet. The pilot returned to 6,500 feet, but  responded to ATC that he had been cleared to 5,000 feet.  When he had read back 5,000 feet to the controller, he  received no correction from the controller. After almost  simultaneous ground proximity warning system (GPWS)  and controller warnings, the pilot climbed and avoided  the terrain. The recording of the radio transmissions  confirmed that the aircraft was cleared to 7,000 feet and  the pilot mistakenly read back 5,000 feet then attempted  to descend to 5,000 feet. The pilot stated in the report: “I  don’t know how much clearance from the mountains we  had, but it certainly makes clear the importance of good  communications between the controller and pilot.”  

ATC is not always responsible for safe terrain clearance for  the aircraft under its jurisdiction. Many times ATC issue en  route clearances for pilots to proceed off airway direct to  a point. Pilots who accept this type of clearance also are  accepting the shared responsibility for maintaining safe  terrain clearance. Know the height of the highest terrain  and obstacles in the operating area and your position in  relation to the surrounding high terrain.  

The following are excerpts from CFIT accidents related  

![](images/4b36f2f57724111ace4c91d6bcede1a9d470064ed057a85e7b4a865a88121f0c.jpg)

to descending on arrival: “…delayed the initiation of the  descent…”; “Aircraft prematurely descended too early…”;  “…late getting down…”; “During a descent…incorrectly  cleared down…”; “…aircraft prematurely let down…”;  “…lost situational awareness…”; “Premature descent  clearance…”; “Prematurely descended…”; “Premature  descent clearance while on vector…”; “During initial  descent…” [Figure 3-9]  

Practicing good communication skills is not limited to just  pilots and controllers. In its findings from a 1974 air carrier  accident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  wrote, “…the extraneous conversation conducted by the  flight crew during the descent was symptomatic of a lax  atmosphere in the flight deck that continued throughout  the approach.” The NTSB listed the probable cause as “…  the flight crew’s lack of altitude awareness at critical points  during the approach due to poor flight deck discipline in  that the crew did not follow prescribed procedures.”  

In 1981, the FAA issued 14 CFR Part 121, § 121.542 and  Part 135, § 135.100, Flight Crewmember Duties, commonly  referred to as “sterile flight deck rules.”The provisions in this  rule can help pilots, operating under any regulations, to  avoid altitude and course deviations during arrival. In part,  it states: (a) No certificate holder should  require, nor may  any flight crewmember perform, any duties during a critical  phase of flight except those duties required for the safe  operation of the aircraft. Duties such as company required  calls made for such purposes as ordering galley supplies  and confirming passenger connections, announcements  made to passengers promoting the air carrier or pointing  out sights of interest, and filling out company payroll and  related records are not required for the safe operation of  the aircraft. (b) No flight crewmember may engage in, nor  may any pilot in command permit, any activity during  a critical phase of flight that could distract any flight  crewmember from the performance of his or her duties or  which could interfere in any way with the proper conduct  of those duties. Activities such as eating meals, engaging  in nonessential conversations within the flight deck and  nonessential communications between the cabin and  flight deck crews, and reading publications not related to  the proper conduct of the flight are not required for the  safe operation of the aircraft. (c) Critical phases of flight  include all ground operations involving taxi, takeoff and  landing, and all other flight operations conducted below  10,000 feet, except cruise flight.  

# Standard Terminal Arrival Routes  (STARs)  

A STAR is an ATC-coded IFR route established for application  to arriving IFR aircraft destined for certain airports. A STAR  provides a critical form of communication between pilots  and ATC. Once a flight crew has accepted a clearance for a  STAR, they have communicated with the controller what  route, and in some cases what altitude and airspeed, they  fly during the arrival, depending on the type of clearance.  The STAR provides a common method for leaving the en  route structure and navigating to your destination. It is a  preplanned instrument flight rule ATC arrival procedure  published for pilot use in graphic and textual form that  simplifies clearance delivery procedures.  

The principal difference between standard instrument  departure (SID) or departure procedures (DPs) and STARs  is that the DPs start at the airport pavement and connect  to the en route structure. STARs on the other hand, start  at the en route structure but do not make it down to the  pavement. This is primarily because STARs serve multiple  runways and sometimes multiple airports.  

![](images/30a808509018f7363cbdcd3e00697fcbc7c411a9bb2e9767177688d43b11ed50.jpg)  
Figure 3-10.  Arrival charts.  

STARs greatly help to facilitate the transition between the  en route and approach phases of flight. The STAR will end  at a fix or NAVAID, designated by ATC, which allows for  radar vectors and/or to connect to an instrument approach  procedure. The objective when connecting a STAR to an  instrument approach procedure is to ensure a seamless  lateral and vertical transition. The STAR and approach  procedure should connect to one another in such a way as  to maintain the overall descent and deceleration profiles.  This often results in a seamless transition between the en  route, arrival, and approach phases of flight, and serves as  a preferred route into high volume terminal areas. [Figure  3-10]  

STARs provide a transition from the en route structure to an  approach gate, outer fix, instrument approach fix, or arrival  waypoint in the terminal area, and they usually terminate  with an instrument or visual approach procedure. STARs  are included at the front of each Terminal Procedures  Publication (TPP) regional booklet.  

For STARs based on conventional NAVAIDs, the procedure  design and obstacle clearance criteria are essentially the  same as that for en route criteria, covered in Chapter 2,  En Route Operations. STAR procedures typically include  a descent gradient of about 318 ft/NM, or about three  degrees. The descent gradient on a STAR will have to vary  to meet altitude restrictions, if any, along the particular  route. Altitude restrictions are frequently necessary for  airspace and air traffic restrictions. The design guidance for  a new or revised STAR is in FAA Order 8260.3, published in  March 2016. Some published STARs were designed under  the previous guidance in FAA Order JO 7110.9. The new  guidance requires a more shallow descent gradient for the  last part of the STAR. In addition to descent gradients, STARs  allow for deceleration segments at any waypoint that has  a speed restriction. As a general guideline, deceleration  considerations typically add 1 NM of distance for each 10  knots of speed reduction required.  

# RNAV STARs or STAR Transitions  

STARs designated RNAV serve the same purpose as  conventional STARs, but are only used by aircraft equipped  with FMS or GPS. An RNAV STAR or STAR transition typically  includes flyby waypoints, with fly over waypoints used  only when operationally required. These waypoints may  be assigned crossing altitudes and speeds to optimize  the descent and deceleration profiles. RNAV STARs often  are designed, coordinated, and approved by a joint effort  between air carriers, commercial operators, and the ATC  facilities that have jurisdiction for the affected airspace.  

RNAV STAR procedure design, such as minimum leg  length, maximum turn angles, obstacle assessment criteria,  including widths of the primary and secondary areas, use  similar design criteria as other RNAV procedures. Likewise,  RNAV STAR procedures are designated as either RNAV 1  or RNAV 2, based on the aircraft navigation equipment  required, flight crew procedures, and the process and  criteria used to develop the STAR. The RNAV 1 or RNAV  2 designation appears in the notes on the chart. RNAV 1  STARs have higher equipment requirements and, often,  tighter required navigation performance (RNP) tolerances  than RNAV 2. For RNAV 1 STARS, pilots are required to use  a course deviation indicator (CDI)/flight director, and/or  autopilot in LNAV mode while operating on RNAV courses.  (These requirements are detailed in Chapter 1 of this book,  under RNAV Departures.) RNAV 1 STARs are generally  designated for high-traffic areas. Controllers may clear a  pilot to use an RNAV STAR in various ways.  

If the pilots clearance simply states, “cleared HADLY ONE  arrival,” the pilot is to use the arrival for lateral routing only.  

•   A clearance such as “cleared HADLY ONE arrival,  descend and maintain flight level two four zero,”  clears the pilot to descend only to the assigned  altitude, and then should maintain that altitude until  cleared for further descent.  •   If the pilot is cleared using the phrase “descend via,”  the controller expects the pilot to use the equipment  for both lateral guidance and altitude restrictions, as  published on the chart.  •   The controller may also clear the pilot to use the  arrival with specific exceptions—for example,  “Descend via the HARIS ONE arrival, except cross  BRUNO at one three thousand then maintain one  zero thousand.” In this case, the pilot should track the  arrival both laterally and vertically, descending so as  to comply with all altitude and airspeed restrictions  until reaching BRUNO, and then maintain 10,000 feet  until cleared by ATC to continue to descend.  •   Pilots might also be given direct routing to intercept  a STAR and then use it for both lateral guidance and  altitude restrictions. For example, “Proceed direct  MAHEM, descend via the MAHEM TWO arrival.”  

# Interpreting the STAR  

STARs use much of the same symbology as departure  and approach charts. In fact, a STAR may at first appear  identical to a similar graphic DP, except the direction of  flight is reversed and the procedure ends at a fix. The STAR  arrival route, also called the basic STAR procedure or the  common route or common point, begins at the common  

![](images/d710e6dbe04dea43108f83e56454e14f56887d360f207c3eb2542960d13f0e50.jpg)

NAVAID, intersection, or fix where all the various (en route)  transitions to the arrival come together. A STAR en route  transition is a published segment used to connect one or  more en route airways, jet routes, or RNAV routes to the  basic STAR procedure. It is one of several routes that bring  traffic from different directions into one STAR. This way,  arrivals from several directions can be accommodated on  the same chart, and traffic flow is routed appropriately  within the congested airspace.  

To illustrate how STARs can be used to simplify a complex  clearance and reduce frequency congestion, consider  the following arrival clearance issued to a pilot flying to  Seattle, Washington, depicted in Figure 3-11:   “Cessna 32G,  cleared to the Seattle/Tacoma International Airport as filed.  Maintain 12,000. At the Ephrata VOR, intercept the   $221^{\circ}$  radial to CHINS Intersection. Intercept the  $284^{\circ}$   radial of the  Yakima VOR to RADDY Intersection. Cross RADDY at 10,000.

Figure 3-12.  Reducing pilot/controlling workload.  

Continue via the Yakima  $284^{\circ}$   radial to AUBRN Intersection.  Expect radar vectors to the final approach course.”  

Now consider how this same clearance is issued when a  STAR exists for this terminal area. “Cessna 32G, cleared to  Seattle/Tacoma International Airport as filed, then CHINS  EIGHT ARRIVAL, Ephrata Transition. Maintain 10,000 feet.” A  shorter transmission conveys the same information.  

Safety is enhanced when both pilots and controllers know  what to expect. Effective communication increases with the  reduction of repetitive clearances, decreasing congestion  on control frequencies. To accomplish this, STARs are  developed according to the following criteria:  

•   STARs must be simple, easily understood and, if  possible, limited to one page. 

 •   A STAR transition should be able to accommodate as  many different types of aircraft as possible. 

 •   VHF Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Aircraft Control  (VORTACs) are used wherever possible, with some  exceptions on RNAV STARs, so that military and  civilian aircraft can use the same arrival. 

 •   DME arcs within a STAR should be avoided since  not all aircraft operating under IFR are equipped to  navigate them. 

 •   Altitude crossing and airspeed restrictions are  

![](images/e9214050749ed211fb83e26a1e6695bcc79dd1a873abe1bcf18d5a8c1ad3a723.jpg)  

included when they are assigned by ATC a majority  of the time. [Figure 3-12]  

STARs usually are named according to the point at which  the procedure begins. In the United States, typically there  are en route transitions before the STAR itself. So the STAR  name is usually the same as the last fix on the en route  transitions where they come together to begin the basic  STAR procedure. A STAR that commences at the CHINS  Intersection becomes the CHINS SEVEN ARRIVAL. When a  significant portion of the arrival is revised, such as an altitude,  a route, or data concerning the NAVAID, the number of the  arrival changes. For example, the CHINS SEVEN ARRIVAL is  now the CHINS EIGHT ARRIVAL due to modifications in the  procedure.  

Studying the STARs for an airport may allow pilots to perceive  the specific topography of the area. Note the initial fixes  and where they correspond to fixes on the Aeronautical  Information Services en route or area chart. Arrivals may  incorporate step-down fixes when necessary to keep aircraft  within airspace boundaries or  for obstacle clearance. Routes  between fixes contain courses, distances, and minimum  altitudes, alerting aircrews to possible obstructions or terrain  under their arrival path. Airspeed restrictions also appear  where they aid in managing the traffic flow. In addition,  some STARs require that pilots use DME and/or ATC radar.  Aircrews can decode the symbology on the PAWLING TWO  ARRIVAL by referring to the legend at the beginning of the  TPP . [Figure 3-13]  

# STAR Procedures  

Pilots may accept a STAR within a clearance or they may  file for one in their flight plan. As the aircraft nears its  destination airport, ATC may add a STAR procedure to  its original clearance. Keep in mind that ATC can assign  a STAR even if the aircrew has not requested one. Use of  a STAR requires pilot possession of at least the approved  chart. RNAV STARs must be retrievable by the procedure  name from the aircraft database and conform to charted  procedure. If an aircrew does not want to use a STAR, they  must specify “No STAR” in the remarks section of their flight  plan. Pilots may also refuse the STAR when it is given to  them verbally by ATC, but the system works better if the  aircrew advises ATC ahead of time.  

# Preparing for the Arrival  

As mentioned before, STARs include navigation fixes that  are used to provide transition and arrival routes from  the en route structure to the final approach course. They  also may lead to a fix where radar vectors are provided  to intercept the final approach course. Pilots may have  noticed that minimum crossing altitudes and airspeed  restrictions appear on some STARs. These expected  altitudes and airspeeds are not part of the clearance until  ATC includes them verbally. A STAR is simply a published  routing; it does not have the force of a clearance until  issued specifically by ATC. For example, minimum en route  altitude (MEAs) printed on STARs are not valid unless stated  within an ATC clearance or in cases of lost communication.  After receiving the arrival clearance, the aircrew should  review the assigned STAR procedure and ensure the FMS  has the appropriate procedure loaded (if so equipped).  Obtain the airport and weather information as early  as practical. It is recommended that pilots have this  information prior to flying the STAR. If you are landing at  an airport with approach control services that has two or  more published instrument approach procedures, you will  receive advance notice of which instrument approaches  to expect. This information is broadcast either by ATIS or  by a controller. [Figure 3-14] It may not be provided when  the visibility is 3 SM or better and the ceiling is at or above  the highest initial approach altitude established for any  instrument approach procedure for the airport.  

For STAR procedures charted with radar vectors to the  final approach, look for routes from the STAR terminating  fixes to the IAF. If no route is depicted, you should have  a predetermined plan of action to fly from the STAR  terminating fix to the IAF in the event of a communication  failure.  

# Reviewing the Approach  

Once the aircrew has determined which approach to  expect, review the approach chart thoroughly before  entering the terminal area. Aircrews should check fuel level  and make sure a prolonged hold or increased headwinds  have not cut into the aircraft’s fuel reserves because there is  always a chance the pilot has to make a missed approach or  go to an alternate. By completing landing checklists early,  aircrews can concentrate on the approach.  

In setting up for the expected approach procedure when  using an RNAV, GPS, or FMS system, it is important to  understand how multiple approaches to the same runway  are coded in the database. When more than one RNAV  procedure is issued for the same runway, there must be a  way to differentiate between them within the equipment’s  database, as well as to select which procedure is to be  used. (Multiple procedures may exist to accommodate GPS  receivers and FMS, both with and without VNAV capability.)  Each procedure name incorporates a letter of the alphabet,  starting with Z and working backward through Y, X, W, and  so on. (Naming conventions for approaches are covered in  more depth in the next chapter). [Figure 3-15]

Figure 3-15.  Two RNAV (GPS) approaches to Runway 15R at Baltimore. A controller issuing a clearance for one of these approaches  would speak the identifying letter—for example, “...cleared for the RNAV (GPS) Yankee approach, Runway 15R...”  

# Altitude  

Upon arrival in the terminal area, ATC either clears the  aircraft to a specific altitude, or they give it a “descend  via” clearance that instructs the pilot to follow the  altitudes published on the STAR. [Figure 3-16] Pilots are  not authorized to leave their last assigned altitude unless  specifically cleared to do so. If ATC amends the altitude or  route to one that is different from the published procedure,  the rest of the charted descent procedure is canceled. ATC  assigns any further route, altitude, or airspeed clearances,  as necessary. Notice the JANESVILLE FOUR ARRIVAL depicts  only one published arrival route, with no named transition  routes leading to the basic STAR procedure beginning at  the Janesville VOR/DME. VNAV planning information is  included for turbojet and turboprop aircraft at the bottom  of the chart. Additionally, note that there are several ways to  identify the BRIBE reporting point using alternate formation  radials, some of which are from off- chart NAVAIDs. ATC may  issue a descent clearance that includes a crossing altitude  restriction. In the PENNS ONE ARRIVAL, the ATC clearance  authorizes aircraft to descend at the pilots’ discretion, as  long as the pilot crosses  the PENNS Intersection at 6,000  feet MSL. [Figure 3-17]  

In the United States, Canada, and many other countries,  the common altitude for changing to the standard  altimeter setting of 29.92 inches of mercury ("Hg) (or  1013.2 hectopascals or millibars) when climbing to the high  altitude structure is 18,000 feet. When descending from  high altitude, the altimeter should be changed to the local  altimeter setting when passing through FL 180, although  in most countries throughout the world the change to or  from the standard altimeter setting is not done at the same  altitude for each instance.  

For example, the flight level where aircrews change their  altimeter setting to the local altimeter setting is specified  by ATC each time they arrive at a specific airport. This  information is shown on STAR charts outside the United  States with the words: TRANS LEVEL: BY ATC. When  departing from that same airport (also depicted typically on  the STAR chart), the altimeter should be set to the standard  setting when passing through 5,000 feet, as an example.  This means that altimeter readings when flying above  5,000 feet are actual flight levels, not feet. This is common  for Europe, but very different for pilots experienced with  flying in the United States and Canada.  

Although standardization of these procedures for terminal  locations is subject to local considerations, specific criteria  apply in developing new or revised arrival procedures.  Normally, high performance aircraft enter the terminal  area at or above 10,000 feet above the airport elevation  and begin their descent 30 to 40 NM from touchdown on  the landing runway. Unless pilots indicate an operational  need for a lower altitude, descent below 5,000 feet above  the airport elevation is typically limited to an altitude where  

![](images/adba2bac62f96699b36c0e9e4b040136e81445eaa1af130c759938062f697fbe.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.  Assigned altitudes.  

final descent and glideslope/glidepath intercept can be  made without exceeding specific obstacle clearance and  other related arrival, approach, and landing criteria.  Arrival delays typically are absorbed at a metering fix.  This fix is established on a route prior to the terminal  airspace, 10,000 feet or more above the airport elevation.  The metering fix facilitates profile descents, rather than  controllers using delaying vectors or a holding pattern at  low altitudes. Descent restrictions normally are applied  prior to reaching the final approach phase to preclude  relatively high descent rates close in to the destination  airport. At least 10 NM from initial descent from 10,000  feet above the airport elevation, the controller issues  an advisory that details when to expect to commence  the descent. ATC typically uses the phraseology, “Expect  descent in (number) miles.” Standard ATC phraseology  is, “Maintain (altitude) until specified point (e.g., abeam  landing runway end), cleared for visual approach or expect  visual or contact approach clearance in (number of miles,  minutes, or specified point).”  

Once the determination is made regarding the instrument  approach and landing runway pilots use, ATC will not  permit a change to another NAVAID that is not aligned with  the landing runway. When altitude restrictions are required  for separation purposes, ATC avoids assigning an altitude  

![](images/64a335eee9fd8292b012283cdbd28b5988506ed2dff9dfa53024d48b7e524a2a.jpg)  
Figure 3-17.  Altitude restrictions.  

below 5,000 feet above the airport elevation.  

There are numerous exceptions to the high performance  aircraft arrival procedures previously outlined. For example,  in a non-radar environment, the controller may clear the  flight to use an approach based on a NAVAID other than  the one aligned with the landing runway, such as a circling  approach. In this case, the descent to a lower altitude  usually is limited to the circling approach area with the  circle-to-land maneuver confined to the traffic pattern.  

IFR en route descent procedures should include a review  of minimum, maximum, mandatory, and recommended  altitudes that normally precede the fix or NAVAID facility  to which they apply. The initial descent gradient for a low  altitude instrument approach procedure does not exceed  500 ft/NM (approximately 5°), and for a high altitude  approach, the maximum allowable initial gradient is 1,000  ft/NM (approximately   $10^{\circ})$  ).  

Remember during arrivals, when cleared for an instrument  approach, maintain the last assigned altitude until  established on a published segment of the approach or on  a segment of a published route. If no altitude is assigned  with the approach clearance and the aircraft is already on a  published segment, the pilot can descend to its minimum  altitude for that segment of the approach.  

# Airspeed  

During the arrival, expect to make adjustments in speed at  the controller’s request. When pilots fly a high-performance  aircraft on an IFR flight plan, ATC may ask them to adjust  their airspeed to achieve proper traffic sequencing  and separation. This also reduces the amount of radar  vectoring required in the terminal area. When operating  a reciprocating engine or turboprop airplane within 20  NM from the destination airport, 150 knots is usually the  slowest airspeed that is assigned. If the aircraft cannot  maintain the assigned airspeed, the pilot must advise ATC.  Controllers may ask pilots to maintain the same speed as  the aircraft ahead of or behind them on the approach. Pilots  are expected to maintain the specified airspeed  $\pm10$   knots.  At other times, ATC may ask pilots to increase or decrease  airspeed by 10 knots, or multiples thereof. When the speed  adjustment is no longer needed, ATC advises the pilot to “…  resume normal speed.”  

Keep in mind that the maximum speeds specified in 14 CFR  Part 91, § 91.117 still apply during speed adjustments. It is  the pilot’s responsibility to advise ATC if an assigned speed  adjustment would cause an exceedence of these limits.  For operations in Class C or D airspace at or below 2,500  feet above ground level (AGL), within 4 NM of the primary  airport, ATC has the authority to approve a faster speed than  those prescribed in 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.117.  

Pilots operating at or above 10,000 feet MSL on an assigned  speed adjustment that is greater than 250 KIAS are expected  to reduce speed to 250 KIAS to comply with 14 CFR Part  91, § 91.117(a) when cleared below 10,000 feet MSL, within  domestic airspace. This speed adjustment is made without  notifying ATC. Pilots are expected to comply with the other  provisions of 14 CFR Part 91,   $\S~91.117$   without notifying  ATC. For example, it is normal for faster aircraft to level off  at 10,000 feet MSL while slowing to the 250 KIAS limit that  applies below that altitude, and to level off at 2,500 feet  above airport elevation to slow to the 200 KIAS limit that  applies within the surface limits of Class C or D airspace.  Controllers anticipate this action and plan accordingly.  

Speed restrictions of 250 knots do not apply to aircraft  operating beyond 12 NM from the coastline within the  United States Flight Information Region in offshore Class  E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL. In airspace underlying  a Class B airspace area designated for an airport, pilots are  expected to comply with the 200 KIAS limit specified in 14  CFR Part 91, § 91.117(c). (See 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.117(c)  and 91.703.) Approach clearances cancel any previously  assigned speed adjustment.  

# Holding Patterns  

If aircraft reach a clearance limit before receiving a further  clearance from ATC, a holding pattern is required at the  last assigned altitude. Controllers assign holds for a variety  of reasons, including deteriorating weather or high traffic  volume. Holding might also be required following a missed  approach. Since flying outside the area set aside for a  holding pattern could lead to an encounter with terrain  or other aircraft, aircrews need to understand the size of  the protected airspace that a holding pattern provides.  Each holding pattern has a fix, a direction to hold from  the fix, and an airway, bearing, course, radial, or route on  which the aircraft is to hold. These elements, along with the  direction of the turns, define the holding pattern.  

Since the speed of the aircraft affects the size of a holding  pattern, maximum holding airspeeds have been designated  to limit the amount of airspace that must be protected. The  three airspeed limits are shown in Figure 2-73 in Chapter 2,  En Route Operations, of this book. Some holding patterns  have additional airspeed restrictions to keep faster aircraft  from flying out of the protected area. These are depicted  on charts by using an icon and the limiting airspeed.  

DME and IFR-certified GPS equipment offer some additional  options for holding. Rather than being based on time, the  leg lengths for DME/GPS holding patterns are based on  distances in nautical miles. These patterns use the same  entry and holding procedures as conventional holding  patterns. The controller or the instrument approach  procedure chart specifies the length of the outbound leg.  The end of the outbound leg is determined by the DME  

![](images/a648f527443409b243fbdacca1289322bb8119ab39e987ce1835639b7e96aee1.jpg)  
Figure 3-18.  Instead of flying for a specific time after passing the holding fix, these holding patterns use distances to mark where the  turns are made. The distances come from DME or IFR-certified GPS equipment.  

or the along track distance (ATD) readout. The holding  fix on conventional procedures, or controller-defined  holding based on a conventional navigation aid with DME,  is a specified course or radial and distances are from the  DME station for both the inbound and outbound ends of  the holding pattern. When flying published GPS overlay  or standalone procedures with distance specified, the  holding fix is a waypoint in the database and the end of the  outbound leg is determined by the ATD. Instead of using  the end of the outbound leg, some FMS are programmed  to cue the inbound turn so that the inbound leg length  matches the charted outbound leg length.  

Normally, the difference is negligible, but in high winds,  this can enlarge the size of the holding pattern. Aircrews  need to understand their aircraft’s FMS holding program to  ensure that the holding entry procedures and leg lengths  match the holding pattern. Some situations may require  pilot intervention in order to stay within protected airspace.  

# [Figure 3-18]  

# Approach Clearance  

The approach clearance provides guidance to a position  from where the pilot can execute the approach. It is also  a clearance to fly that approach. If only one approach  procedure exists, or if ATC authorizes the aircrew to execute  the approach procedure of their choice, the clearance  may be worded as simply as “… cleared for approach.”  If ATC wants to restrict the pilot to a specific approach,  the controller names the approach in the clearance. For  example, “…cleared ILS Runway 35 Right approach.”  

When the landing is to be  made on a runway that is not  aligned with the approach being flown, the controller may  issue a circling approach clearance, such as “…cleared  for VOR Runway 17 approach, circle to land Runway 23.”  Approaches whose final approach segment is more than 30  degrees different from the landing runway alignment are  

Figure 3-19.  Cleared present position direct from V295.  

![](images/a085167ff003e6b2391e538f657131b06f1d55c8004ff97e121c42b111a4bf1b.jpg)  

always designated as circling approaches. Unless a specific  landing runway is specified in the approach clearance,  the pilot may land on any runway. Pilots landing at non- towered airports are reminded of the importance of making  radio calls as set forth in the AIM.  

When cleared for an approach prior to reaching a holding  fix, ATC expects the pilot to continue to the holding fix,  along the feeder route associated with the fix, and then  to the IAF. If a feeder route to an IAF begins at a fix located  along the route of flight prior to reaching the holding fix,  and clearance for an approach is issued, the pilot should  commence the approach via the published feeder route.  The pilot is expected to commence the approach in a  similar manner at the IAF, if the IAF is located along the  route to the holding fix.  

ATC also may clear an aircraft directly to the IAF by using  language such as “direct” or “proceed direct.” Controllers  normally identify an approach by its published name,  even if some component of the approach aid (such as  the glideslope of an ILS) is inoperative or unreliable. The  controller uses the name of the approach as published but  advises the aircraft when issuing the approach clearance  that the component is unusable.  

# Present Position Direct  

In addition to using high and low altitude en route charts  as resources for arrivals, area charts can be helpful as a  planning aid for SA. Many pilots find the area chart helpful  in locating a depicted fix after ATC clears them to proceed  to a fix and hold, especially at unfamiliar airports.  

Looking at Figures 3-19 and 3-20 assume the pilot is on  V295 northbound en route to Palm Beach International  Airport. The pilot is en route on the airway when the  controller clears him present position direct to the ZISUR  (IAF) and for the ILS approach. There is no transition  authorized or charted between his present position and the  approach facility. There is no minimum altitude published  for the route the pilot is about to travel.  

In Figure 3-20, the pilot is just north of HEATT Intersection  at 5,000 feet when the approach controller states, “Citation  9724J, two miles from HEATT, cleared present position  direct ZISUR, cleared for the Palm Beach ILS Runway 10L  Approach, contact Palm Beach Tower on 119.1 established  inbound.”With no minimum altitude published from that  point to the ZISUR intersection, the pilot should maintain  the last assigned altitude until he reaches the IAF. In  Figure 3-19, after passing ZISUR intersection outbound,  commence the descent to 2,000 feet for the course reversal.  The ILS procedure relies heavily on the controller’s  recognition of the restriction upon the pilot to maintain  the last assigned altitude until “established” on a published  segment of the approach. Prior to issuing a clearance for the  approach, the controller usually assigns the pilot an altitude  to maintain until established on the final approach course ,  compatible with glideslope intercept.  

# Radar Vectors to Final Approach Course  

Arriving aircraft usually are vectored to intercept the final  approach course, except with vectors for a visual approach,  at least 2 NM outside the approach gate unless one of the  

![](images/ec5a2397e29e2f8435e01a9a8e7229b7c4e83055b19cca7603834ba32f94adc2.jpg)  
Figure 3-21.  Arrival instructions when established.  

following exists:  

1.  When the reported ceiling is at least 500 feet above  the minimum vectoring altitude or minimum IFR  altitude and the visibility is at least 3 NM (report  may be a pilot report if no weather is reported for  the airport), aircraft may be vectored to intercept  the final approach course closer than 2 NM outside  the approach gate but no closer than the approach  gate.  2.  If specifically requested by a pilot, ATC may vector  aircraft to intercept the final approach course inside  the approach gate but no closer than the final  approach fix (FAF).  

For a precision approach, aircraft are vectored at an altitude  that is not above the glideslope/glidepath or below the  minimum glideslope/glidepath intercept altitude specified  on the approach procedure chart. For a non-precision  approach, aircraft are vectored at an altitude that allows  descent in accordance with the published procedure.  

When a vector takes the aircraft across the final approach  course, pilots are informed by ATC and the reason for the  action is stated. In the event that ATC is not able to inform  the aircraft, the pilot is not expected to turn inbound on  the final approach course unless an approach clearance has  been issued. An example of ATC phraseology in this case  is, “… expect vectors across final for spacing.”  

The following ATC arrival instructions are issued to an IFR  aircraft before it reaches the approach gate:  

1.  Position relative to a fix on the final approach course.  If none is portrayed on the controller’s radar display  or if none is prescribed in the instrument approach  procedure, ATC issues position information relative  to the airport or relative to the NAVAID that provides  final approach guidance.  

2.  Vector to intercept the final approach course if  required.  

3.  Approach clearance except when conducting a radar  approach. ATC issues the approach clearance only  after the aircraft is established on a segment of a  published route or instrument approach procedure, or  in the following examples as depicted in Figure 3-21.  

Aircraft 1 was vectored to the final approach course  but clearance was withheld. It is now at 4,000 feet and  established on a segment of the instrument approach  procedure. “Seven miles from X-RAY. Cleared ILS runway  three six approach.”  

Aircraft 2 is being vectored to a published segment of  

![](images/061311f4a2d710bdbb241e1fe038a5049df2c239984020001be80f11ecf71a50.jpg)  
Figure 3-22.  Arrival instructions when not established.  

the final approach course, 4 NM from LIMA at 2,000 feet.  The minimum vectoring altitude for this area is 2,000 feet.  “Four miles from LIMA. Turn right heading three four zero.  Maintain two thousand until established on the localizer.  Cleared ILS runway three six approach.”  

Aircraft 3: There are many times when it is desirable to  position an aircraft onto the final approach course prior to  a published, charted segment of an instrument approach  procedure (IAP).  

Sometimes IAPs have no initial segment and require  vectors. “RADAR REQUIRED” is charted in the plan view.  Sometimes a route intersects an extended final approach  course making a long intercept desirable.  

When ATC issues a vector or clearance to the final approach  course beyond the published segment, controllers assign  an altitude to maintain until the aircraft is established on  a segment of a published route or IAP. This ensures that  both the pilot and controller know precisely what altitude  is to be flown and precisely where descent to appropriate  minimum altitudes or step-down altitudes can begin.  

Most aircraft are vectored onto a localizer or final approach  course between an intermediate fix and the approach gate.  These aircraft normally are told to maintain an altitude until  established on a segment of the approach.  

When an aircraft is assigned a route that is not a published  segment of an approach, the controller must issue an  altitude to maintain until the aircraft is established on a  published segment of the approach.  [Figure 3-21]  Assume  the aircraft is established on the final approach course  beyond the approach segments, 8 NM from Alpha at 6,000  feet. The minimum vectoring altitude for this area is 4,000  feet. “Eight miles from Alpha. Cross Alpha at or above four  thousand. Cleared ILS runway three six approach.”  

If an aircraft is not established on a segment of a published  approach and is not conducting a radar approach,  ATC assigns an altitude to maintain until the aircraft  is established on a segment of a published route or  instrument approach procedure. [Figure 3-22]  

The aircraft is being vectored to a published segment of the  ILS final approach course, 3 NM from Alpha at 4,000 feet.  The minimum vectoring altitude for this area is 4,000 feet.  “Three miles from Alpha. Turn left heading two one zero.  Maintain four thousand until established on the localizer.  

Cleared ILS runway one eight approach.”  

The ATC assigned altitude ensures IFR obstruction  clearance from the point at which the approach clearance  is issued until established on a segment of a published  route or instrument approach procedure.  

ATC tries to make frequency changes prior to passing the  FAF, although when radar is used to establish the FAF, ATC  informs the pilot to contact the tower on the local control  frequency after being advised that the aircraft is over the  fix. For example, “Three miles from final approach fix. Turn  left heading zero one zero. Maintain two thousand until  established on the localizer. Cleared ILS runway three six  approach. I will advise when over the fix.”  

“Over final approach fix. Contact tower one-one eight  point one.”

It is important to note an example of additional resources  that are helpful for arrivals, especially into unfamiliar  airports requiring special pilot or navigation qualifications.  The operating rules governing domestic and flag air  carriers require pilots in command to be qualified over  the routes and into airports where scheduled operations  are conducted, including areas, routes, and airports in  which special pilot qualifications or special navigation  qualifications are needed. For Part 119 certificate holders  

![Figure 3-27.  Special airports and comments.  ](images/d18323404d7a482369c7e7359c1ef7a59613c26150e8efca362f9ee8b77a84c7.jpg)  

who conduct operations under 14 CFR Part 121, § 121.443,  there are provisions in OpSpecs under which operators can  comply with this regulation. Figure 3-27 provides some  examples of special airports in the United States along with  associated comments.  

# Chapter 4    Approaches  

Introduction  

This chapter discusses general planning and conduct of  instrument approaches by pilots operating under Title 14 of  the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Parts 91,121, 125,  and 135. The operations specifications (OpSpecs), standard  operating procedures (SOPs), and any other FAA- approved  documents for each commercial operator are the final  authorities for individual authorizations and limitations as  they relate to instrument approaches. While coverage of  the various authorizations and approach limitations for all  operators is beyond the scope of this chapter, an attempt  is made to give examples from generic manuals where it  is appropriate.  

# Approach Planning  

Depending on speed of the aircraft, availability of weather  information, and the complexity of the approach procedure  or special terrain avoidance procedures for the airport  of intended landing, the in-flight planning phase of an  instrument approach can begin as far as 100-200 NM from  the destination. Some of the approach planning should  be accomplished during preflight. In general, there are  five steps that most operators incorporate into their flight  standards manuals for the in-flight planning phase of an  instrument approach:  

•   Gathering weather information, field conditions,  and Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) for the airport of  intended landing.  •   Calculation of performance data, approach speeds,  and thrust/power settings.  •   Flight deck navigation/communication and  automation setup.  •   Instrument approach procedure (IAP) review and, for  flight crews, IAP briefing.  •   Operational review and, for flight crews, operational  briefing.  

Although often modified to suit each individual operator,  these five steps form the basic framework for the in-flight  planning phase of an instrument approach. The extent of  detail that a given operator includes in their SOPs varies  from one operator to another; some may designate which  pilot performs each of the above actions, the sequence, and  the manner in which each action is performed. Others may  leave much of the detail up to individual flight crews and  only designate which tasks should be performed prior to  commencing an approach. Flight crews of all levels, from  single-pilot to multi-crewmember Part 91 operators, can  benefit from the experience of commercial operators in  developing techniques to fly standard instrument approach  procedures (SIAPs).  

Determining the suitability of a specific IAP can be a very  complex task, since there are many factors that can limit  the usability of a particular approach. There are several  questions that pilots need to answer during preflight  planning and prior to commencing an approach. Is the  approach procedure authorized for the company, if Part  91, subpart K, 121, 125, or 135? Is the weather appropriate  for the approach? Is the aircraft currently at a weight that  will allow it the necessary performance for the approach  and landing or go around/ missed approach? Is the aircraft  properly equipped for the approach? Is the flight crew  qualified and current for the approach? Many of these types  of issues must be considered during preflight planning and  within the framework of each specific air carrier’s OpSpecs,  or Part 91.  

# Weather Considerations  

Weather conditions at the field of intended landing dictate  whether flight crews need to plan for an instrument  approach and, in many cases, determine which approaches  can be used, or if an approach can even be attempted. The  gathering of weather information should be one of the first  steps taken during the approach-planning phase. Although  there are many possible types of weather information,  the primary concerns for approach decision-making are  windspeed, wind direction, ceiling, visibility, altimeter  setting, temperature, and field conditions. It is also a good  idea to check NOTAMs at this time, in case there were any  changes since preflight planning.  

Windspeed and direction are factors because they often  limit the type of approach that can be flown at a specific  location. This typically is not a factor at airports with  multiple precision approaches, but at airports with only a  few or one approach procedure, the wrong combination  of wind and visibility can make all instrument approaches  at an airport unavailable. Pilots must be prepared to  execute other available approaches, not just the one that  they may have planned for. As an example, consider the  available approaches at the Chippewa Valley Regional  Airport (KEAU) in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. [Figure 4-1] In the  event that the visibility is reported as less than one mile,  the only useable approaches for Category C aircraft is the  Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Lateral navigation  (LNAV)/vertical navigation (VNAV) to Runway 22. This  leaves very few options for flight crews if the wind does not  favor Runway 22; and, in cases where the wind restricts a  landing on that runway altogether, even a circling approach  cannot be flown because of the visibility.  

# Weather Sources  

Most of the weather information that flight crews receive  is issued to them prior to the start of each flight segment,  but the weather used for in-flight planning and execution  of an instrument approach is normally obtained en route  via government sources, company frequency, or Aircraft  Communications Addressing and Reporting System  (ACARS).  

Air carriers and operators certificated under the provisions  of Part 119 (Certification: Air Carriers and Commercial  Operators) are required to use the aeronautical weather  information systems defined in the OpSpecs issued to that  certificate holder by the FAA. These systems may use basic  FAA/National Weather Service (NWS) weather services,  contractor or operator-proprietary weather services, and/  

![](images/64b97969b6bb60fd3375e498b672ca448d4c00d510a39a0a3694de579f3de272.jpg)

or Enhanced Weather Information System (EWINS) when  approved in the OpSpecs. As an integral part of EWINS  approval, the procedures for collecting, producing, and  disseminating aeronautical weather information, as well  as the crewmember and dispatcher training to support  the use of system weather products, must be accepted or  approved.  

Operators not certificated under the provisions of 14  CFR Part 119 are encouraged to use FAA/NWS products  through the Flight Service Stations (FSS). FSS provide pilot  weather briefings, en route weather, receive and process  instrument flight rule (IFR) and visual flight rule (VFR) flight  plans, relay air traffic control (ATC) clearances, and issue  NOTAMs. They also provide assistance to lost aircraft and  aircraft in emergency situations and conduct VFR search  and rescue services.  

Direct User Access Terminal System (DUATS), funded by the  FAA, allows any pilot to access weather information and file  a flight plan via computer. Two contract vendors currently  provide information services within the DUATS system,  and can be accessed via the Internet at  www.duats.com  or www.1800wxbrief.com. The current vendors of DUATS  II service and the associated phone numbers are listed in  Chapter 7 of the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

Flight Information Service—Broadcast (FIS-B) provides  certain aviation weather and other aeronautical information  to aircraft equipped with an appropriate flight deck display.  Reception of FIS-B services can be expected within a  ground station coverage volume when line-of-sight  geometry is maintained between the aircraft and ground  station. National Airspace System (NAS) wide service  availability was targeted for 2013 and is currently available  within certain regions. FIS-B provides the following textual  and graphical aviation weather and aeronautical products  free-of-charge. A detailed description of these products  can be found in the AIM.  

•   Aviation Digital Data Services (ADDS) provides the  aviation community with text, digital and graphical  forecasts, analyses, and observations of aviation  related weather variables. ADDS is a joint effort of  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s  (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory, National  Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Research  Applications Laboratory (RAL), and the Aviation  Weather Center (AWC).  

Hazardous In-flight Weather Advisory Service  (HIWAS) is a national program for broadcasting  hazardous weather information continuously over  selected navigation aids (NAVAIDs). The broadcasts  

include advisories such as Airman’s Meteorological  Information (AIRMETs), Significant Meteorological  Information (SIGMETs), convective SIGMETs, and  urgent pilot weather reports (PIREPs/UUA). These  broadcasts are only a summary of the information,  and pilots should contact an FSS for detailed  information.  

•   Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS)  is a service prepared and disseminated by  Flight Service. It provides continuous telephone  recordings of meteorological and aeronautical  information. Specifically, TIBS provides area and  route briefings, as well as airspace procedures and  special announcements, if applicable. It is designed  to be a preliminary briefing tool and is not intended  to replace a standard briefing from a flight service  specialist. The TIBS service is available 24 hours a day  and is updated when conditions change, but it can  only be accessed by a touch tone phone. The phone  numbers for the TIBS service are listed in the Chart  Supplement, formerly the Airport/Facility Directory  (A/FD). TIBS should also contain, but is not limited to:  surface observations, terminal aerodrome forecast  (TAFs), and winds/temperatures aloft forecasts.  

The suite of available aviation weather product types  is expanding with the development of new sensor  systems, algorithms, and forecast models. The FAA and  NWS, supported by the NCAR and the NOAA Forecast  Systems Laboratory (FSL), develop and implement new  aviation weather product types through a comprehensive  process known as the Aviation Weather Technology  Transfer process. This process ensures that user needs  and technical and operational readiness requirements are  met as experimental product types mature to operational  application.  

The development of enhanced communications  capabilities, most notably the internet, has allowed pilots  access to an increasing range of weather service providers  and proprietary products. It is not the intent of the FAA to  limit operator use of this weather information. However,  pilots and operators should be aware that weather services  provided by entities other than the FAA, NWS, or their  contractors (such as the DUATS and flight information  services data link (FISDL) providers) may not meet FAA/  NWS quality control standards.  

# Broadcast Weather  

The most common method used by flight crews to obtain  specific in-flight weather information is to use a source that  broadcasts weather for the specific airport. Information  about ceilings, visibility, wind, temperature, barometric  pressure, and field conditions can be obtained from most  types of broadcast weather services. Broadcast weather  can be transmitted to the aircraft in radio voice format or  digital format, if it is available, via an ACARS system.  

# Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS)  

Automatic terminal information service (ATIS) is the  continuous broadcast of recorded non-control information  in selected high activity terminal areas. Its purpose is to  improve controller effectiveness and to relieve frequency  congestion by automating the repetitive transmission  of essential but routine information. The information is  continuously broadcast over a discrete very high frequency  (VHF) radio frequency or the voice portion of a local NAVAID.  ATIS transmissions on a discrete VHF radio frequency are  engineered to be receivable to a maximum of 60 NM from  the ATIS site and a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet above  ground level (AGL). At most locations, ATIS signals may be  received on the surface of the airport, but local conditions  may limit the maximum ATIS reception distance and/or  altitude. Pilots are urged to cooperate in the ATIS program  as it relieves frequency congestion on approach control,  ground control, and local control frequencies. The CS  indicates airports for which ATIS is provided.  

ATIS information includes the time of the latest weather  sequence, ceiling, visibility, obstructions to visibility,  temperature, dew point (if available), wind direction  (magnetic), velocity, altimeter, other pertinent remarks,  instrument approach and runway in use. The ceiling/sky  condition, visibility, and obstructions to vision may be  omitted from the ATIS broadcast if the ceiling is above  5,000 feet and the visibility is more than five miles. The  departure runway will only be given if different from the  landing runway except at locations having a separate ATIS  for departure. The broadcast may include the appropriate  frequency and instructions for VFR arrivals to make initial  contact with approach control. Pilots of aircraft arriving or  departing the terminal area can receive the continuous  ATIS broadcast at times when flight deck duties are least  pressing and listen to as many repeats as desired. ATIS  broadcast will be updated upon the receipt of any official  hourly and special weather. A new recording will also be  made when there is a change in other pertinent data, such  as runway change and instrument approach in use.  

# Automated Weather Observing Programs  

Automated weather reporting systems are increasingly  being installed at airports. These systems consist of  various sensors, a processor, a computer-generated voice  subsystem, and a transmitter to broadcast local, minute­ by-minute weather data directly to the pilot.  

# Automated Weather Observing System  

The automated weather observing system (AWOS)  observations include the prefix “AUTO” to indicate that  the data are derived from an automated system. Some  AWOS locations are augmented by certified observers who  provide weather and obstruction to vision information in  the remarks of the report when the reported visibility is  less than seven miles. These sites, along with the hours of  augmentation, are published in the CS. Augmentation  is identified in the observation as “OBSERVER WEATHER.”  The AWOS wind speed, direction and gusts, temperature,  dew point, and altimeter setting are exactly the same as  for manual observations. The AWOS also reports density  altitude when it exceeds the field elevation by more than  1,000 feet. The reported visibility is derived from a sensor  near the touchdown of the primary instrument runway.  The visibility sensor output is converted to a visibility value  using a 10-minute harmonic average. The reported sky  condition/ ceiling is derived from the ceilometer located  next to the visibility sensor. The AWOS algorithm integrates  the last 30 minutes of ceilometer data to derive cloud layers  and heights. This output may also differ from the observer  sky condition in that the AWOS is totally dependent upon  the cloud advection over the sensor site.  

# Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)/  Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS)  

The automated surface observing system (ASOS)/  automated weather sensor system (AWSS) is the primary  surface weather observing system of the United States. The  program to install and operate these systems throughout  the United States is a joint effort of the NWS, the FAA, and  the Department of Defense (DOD). AWSS is a follow-on  program that provides identical data as ASOS. ASOS/AWSS  is designed to support aviation operations and weather  forecast activities. The ASOS/ AWSS provides continuous  minute-by-minute observations and performs the basic  observing functions necessary to generate a aviation  routine weather report (METAR) and other aviation weather  information. The information may be transmitted over a  discrete VHF radio frequency or the voice portion of a local  NAVAID. ASOS/AWSS transmissions on a discrete VHF radio  frequency are engineered to be receivable to a maximum of  25 NM from the ASOS/AWSS site and a maximum altitude  of 10,000 feet AGL.  

At many locations, ASOS/AWSS signals may be received  on the surface of the airport, but local conditions may  limit the maximum reception distance and/or altitude.  While the automated system and the human may differ  in their methods of data collection and interpretation,  both produce an observation quite similar in form and  content. For the objective elements, such as pressure,  ambient temperature, dew point temperature, wind, and  precipitation accumulation, both the automated system  and the observer use a fixed location and time-averaging  technique. The quantitative differences between the  observer and the automated observation of these elements  are negligible. For the subjective elements; however,  observers use a fixed time (spatial averaging technique) to  describe the visual elements (sky condition, visibility, and  present weather, etc.), while the automated systems use  a fixed location and time averaging technique. Although  this is a fundamental change, the manual and automated  techniques yield remarkably similar results within the limits  of their respective capabilities.  

The use of the aforementioned visibility reports and  weather services are not limited for Part 91 operators.  Part 121 and 135 operators are bound by their individual  OpSpecs documents and are required to use weather  reports that come from the NWS or other approved  sources. While all OpSpecs are individually tailored, most  operators are required to use ATIS information, runway  visual range (RVR) reports, and selected reports from  automated weather stations. All reports coming from an  AWOS-3 station are usable for Part 121 and 135 operators.  Each type of automated station has different levels of  approval as outlined in individual OpSpecs. Ceiling and  visibility reports given by the tower with the departure  information are always considered official weather, and  RVR reports are typically the controlling visibility reference.  Refer to Chapter 1, Departures, of this manual, as well as  the AIM section 7-1-12 for further description of automated  weather systems.  

# Center Weather Advisories (CWA)  

Center weather advisories (CWAs) are unscheduled inflight,  flow control, air traffic, and aircrew advisories. By nature of  its short lead time, the CWA is not a flight planning product.  It is generally a nowcast for conditions beginning in the  next two hours. CWAs will be issued:  

1.  As a supplement to an existing SIGMET, convective  SIGMET, or AIRMET.  2.  When an in-flight advisory has not been issued  but observed or expected weather conditions  meet SIGMET/AIRMET criteria based on current  pilot reports and reinforced by other sources  of information about existing meteorological  conditions.  3.  When observed or developing weather conditions  do not meet SIGMET, convective SIGMET, or  AIRMET criteria (e.g., in terms of intensity or area  coverage), but current pilot reports or other  

weather information sources indicate that existing  or anticipated meteorological phenomena will  adversely affect the safe and efficient  flow of air  traffic within the ARTCC area of responsibility.  

# Weather Regulatory Requirements  

There are many practical reasons for reviewing weather  information prior to initiating an instrument approach.  Pilots must familiarize themselves with the condition of  individual airports and runways so that they may make  informed decisions regarding fuel management, diversions,  and alternate planning. Because this information is critical,  14 CFR requires pilots to comply with specific weather  minimums for planning and execution of instrument flights  and approaches..  

# Weather Requirements and Part 91 Operators  

According to 14 CFR Part 91, §  91.103, the pilot in command  (PIC) must become familiar with all available information  concerning a flight prior to departure. Included in this  directive is the fundamental basis for pilots to review  NOTAMs and pertinent weather reports and forecasts  for the intended route of flight. This review should  include current weather reports and terminal forecasts  for all intended points of landing and alternate airports.  In addition, a thorough review of an airport’s current  weather conditions should always be conducted prior  to initiating an instrument approach. Pilots should also  consider weather information as a planning tool for fuel  management.  

For flight planning purposes, weather information must be  reviewed in order to determine the necessity and suitability  of alternate airports. For Part 91 operations, the 600-2 and  800-2 rule applies to airports with precision and non- precision approaches, respectively. Approaches with  vertical guidance (APV) are non-precision approaches  because they do not meet the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) Annex 10 standards for a precision  approach. (See Final Approach Segment section later in this  chapter for more information regarding APV approaches.)  Exceptions to the  600-2 and 800-2 alternate minimums are  listed in the front of the Aeronautical Information Services  in the Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) and are  indicated by a symbol         on the approach charts for the  airport. This does not preclude flight crews from initiating  instrument approaches at alternate airports when the  weather conditions are below these minimums. The 600­ 2 and 800-2 rules, or any exceptions, only apply to flight  planning purposes, while published landing minimums  apply to the actual approach at the alternate.  

Weather Requirements and Part 135 Operators  

Unlike Part 91 operators, Part 135 operators may not depart  for a destination unless the forecast weather there will  allow an instrument approach and landing. According to  14 CFR Part 135, § 135.219, flight crews and dispatchers  may only designate an airport as a destination if the latest  weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them,  indicate that the weather conditions will be at or above IFR  landing minimums at the estimated time of arrival (ETA).  This ensures that Part 135 flight crews consider weather  forecasts when determining the suitability of destinations.  Departures for airports can be made when the forecast  weather shows the airport will be at or above IFR minimums  at the ETA, even if current conditions indicate the airport to  be below minimums. Conversely, 14 CFR Part 135, § 135.219  prevents departures when the first airport of intended  landing is currently above IFR landing minimums, but the  forecast weather is below those minimums at the ETA.  

Another very important difference between Part 91  and Part 135 operations is the Part 135 requirement for  airports of intended landing to meet specific weather  criteria once the flight has been initiated. For Part 135,  not only is the weather required to be forecast at or  above instrument flight rules (IFR) landing minimums for  planning a departure, but it also must be above minimums  for initiation of an instrument approach and, once the  approach is initiated, to begin the final approach segment  of an approach. 14 CFR Part 135, § 135.225 states that pilots  may not begin an instrument approach unless the latest  weather report indicates that the weather conditions are  at or above the authorized IFR landing minimums for that  procedure. 14 CFR Part 135, § 135.225 provides relief from  this rule if the aircraft has already passed the final approach  fix (FAF) when the weather report is received. It should be  noted that the controlling factor for determining whether  or not the aircraft can proceed is reported visibility. RVR, if  available, is the controlling visibility report for determining  that the requirements of this section are met. The runway  visibility value (RVV), reported in statute miles (SM), takes  precedent over prevailing visibility. There is no required  timeframe for receiving current weather prior to initiating  the approach.  

# Weather Requirements and Part 121 Operators  

Like Part 135 operators, flight crews and dispatchers  operating under Part 121 must ensure that the appropriate  weather reports or forecasts, or any combination thereof,  indicate that the weather will be at or above the authorized  minimums at the ETA at the airport to which the flight is  dispatched (14 CFR Part 121, § 121.613). This regulation  attempts to ensure that flight crews will always be able to  execute an instrument approach at the destination airport.  Of course, weather forecasts are occasionally inaccurate;  therefore, a thorough review of current weather is required  prior to conducting an approach. Like Part 135 operators,  Part 121 operators are restricted from proceeding past the  FAF of an instrument approach unless the appropriate IFR  landing minimums exist for the procedure. In addition,  descent below the minimum descent altitude (MDA),  decision altitude (DA), or decision height (DH) is governed,  with one exception, by the same rules that apply to Part 91  operators. The exception is that during Part 121 and 135  operations, the airplane is also required to land within the  touchdown zone (TDZ). Refer to the section titled Minimum  Descent Altitude, Decision Altitude, and Decision Height  later in this chapter for more information regarding MDA,  DA, and DH.  

# Aircraft Performance Considerations  

All operators are required to comply with specific airplane  performance limitations that govern approach and landing.  Many of these requirements must be considered prior to the  origination of flight. The primary goal of these performance  considerations is to ensure that the aircraft can remain clear  of obstructions throughout the approach, landing, and go- around phase of flight, as well as land within the distance  required by the FAA. Although the majority of in-depth  performance planning for an instrument flight is normally  done prior to the aircraft’s departure, a general review of  performance considerations is usually conducted prior to  commencing an instrument approach.  

# Aircraft Performance Operating Limitations  

Generally speaking, air carriers must have in place an  approved method of complying with Subpart I of 14  CFR Parts 121 and 135 (Airplane Performance Operating  Limitations), thereby proving the airplane’s performance  capability for every flight that it intends to make. Flight  crews must have an approved method of complying  with the approach and landing performance criteria in  the applicable regulations prior to departing for their  intended destination. The primary source of information for  performance calculations for all operators, including Part  91, is the approved Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or Pilot’s  Operating Handbook (POH) for the make and model of  aircraft that is being operated. It is required to contain the  manufacturer determined performance capabilities of the  aircraft at each weight, altitude, and ambient temperature  that are within the airplane’s listed limitations. Typically, the  AFM for a large turbine powered aircraft should contain  information that allows flight crews to determine that the  aircraft will be capable of performing the following actions,  considering the landing weight and other pertinent  environmental factor:  

•   Land within the distance required by the regulations.  •   Climb from the missed approach point (MAP) and  maintain a specified climb gradient with one engine  inoperative.  •   Perform a go-around from the final stage of landing  and maintain a specified climb gradient with all  engines operating and the aircraft in the landing  configuration.  

Many airplanes have more than one allowable flap  configuration for normal landing. Often, a reduced flap  setting for landing allows the airplane to operate at a higher  landing weight into a field that has restrictive obstacles in  the missed approach or rejected landing climb path. On  these occasions, the full-flap landing speed may not allow  the airplane enough energy to successfully complete a  go-around and avoid any high terrain and/or obstacles  that might exist on the climb out. Therefore, all-engine  and engine-out missed approaches, as well as rejected  landings, must be taken into consideration in compliance  with the regulations.  

# Aircraft Approach Categories  

Aircraft approach category means a grouping of aircraft  based on a reference landing speed   $({\sf V}_{\sf R E F})$  , if specified, or  if  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{R E F}}$    is not specified,   $1.3\;\mathsf{V}_{S0}$    at the maximum certified  landing weight.   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{R E F}},\,\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{S O}},$   and the maximum certified  landing weight are those values as established for the  aircraft by the certification authority of the country of  registry. A pilot must use the minima corresponding to  the category determined during certification or higher.  Helicopters may use Category A minima. If it is necessary  to operate at a speed in excess of the upper limit of the  speed range for an aircraft’s category, the minimums for  the higher category must be used. For example, an airplane  that fits into Category B, but is circling to land at a speed of  145 knots, must use the approach Category D minimums.  As an additional example, a Category A aircraft that is  operating at 130 knots on a straight-in approach must use  the approach Category C minimums. See the following  category limits noting that the airspeeds depicted are  indicated airspeeds (IAS):  

•   Category A:  Speed less than 91 knots.  •   Category B:  Speed 91 knots or more but less than  121 knots.  •   Category C:  Speed 121 knots or more but less than  141 knots.  •   Category D: Speed 141 knots or more but less than  166 knots.  •   Category E:  Speed 166 knots or more.  

Note:  Helicopter pilots may use the Category A line of  minimums provided the helicopter is operated at Category  A airspeeds.  

An airplane is certified in only one approach category, and  although a faster approach may require higher category  minimums to be used, an airplane cannot be flown to the  minimums of a slower approach category. The certified  approach category is permanent and independent of the  changing conditions of day-to-day operations. From a  TERPS viewpoint, the importance of a pilot not operating  an aircraft at a category line of minimums lower than the  aircraft is certified for is primarily the margin of protection  provided for containment of the aircraft within the  procedure design for a slower aircraft. This includes height  loss at the decision altitude, missed approach climb surface,  and turn containment in the missed approach at the higher  category speeds.  

Pilots are responsible for determining if a higher approach  category applies. If a faster approach speed is used that  places the aircraft in a higher approach category, the  minimums for the appropriate higher category must be  used. Emergency returns at weights in excess of maximum  certificated landing weight, approaches made with  inoperative flaps, and approaches made in icing conditions  for some airplanes are examples of situations that can  necessitate the use of higher approach category minima.  

Circling approaches are one of the most challenging  flight maneuvers conducted in the NAS, especially for  pilots of CAT C and CAT D turbine-powered, transport  category airplanes. These maneuvers are conducted at  low altitude, day and night, and often with precipitation  present affecting visibility, depth perception, and the ability  to adequately assess the descent profile to the landing  runway. Most often, circling approaches are conducted to  runways without the benefit of electronic navigation aids to  support the descent from the Circling Minimums Decision  Altitude (CMDA) to the runway.  

Circling approaches conducted at faster-than-normal,  straight-in approach speeds also require a pilot to  consider the larger circling approach area, since published  circling minimums provide obstacle clearance only  within the appropriate area of protection and is based  on the approach category speed. [Figure 4-2] The circling  approach area is the obstacle clearance area for aircraft  maneuvering to land on a runway that does not meet the  criteria for a straight- in approach. The size of the circling  area varies with the approach category of the aircraft, as  shown in Figure 4-2.  

![](images/15dcf874aebc902a7be774cab4e71eab99f7ff24e4d721f145b4c1605254739f.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.  Construction of circling approach area.  

A minimum of 300 feet of obstacle clearance is provided  in the circling segment. Pilots should remain at or above  the circling altitude until the aircraft is continuously in a  position from which a descent to a landing on the intended  runway can be made at a normal rate of descent and using  normal maneuvers. Since an approach category can make  a difference in the approach and weather minimums and,  in some cases, prohibit flight crews from initiating an  approach, the approach speed should be calculated and  the effects on the approach determined and briefed in  the preflight planning phase, as well as reviewed prior to  commencing an approach.  

Prior to FAA Order 8260.3 Change 21, pilots were often  faced with the challenge of descending using a stabilized  approach concept if the CMDA  height above airport  (HAA) exceeded 1,200 feet. Once the HAA approached  1,200 feet, pilots were often forced to increase their rates  of descent in order to arrive at the appropriate “in-slot”  position. “In-slot” being defined as at a minimum, a CAT C  or CAT D turbine-powered airplane should be wings level  on a three degree - 318 ft/NM descent path not less than 1  NM from the touchdown point (1,000 feet beyond runway  threshold). This was due to the small size of the circling  protected airspace that the aircrews must remain within  to ensure obstacle clearance.  

The FAA Order 8260.3 Change 21 to the circling protected  airspace afforded much greater obstacle protection.  

However, it also afforded the pilot the opportunity to  use the extra protected airspace to mitigate the need to  conduct a high descent rate, unstabilized approach that  was often necessary as a result of the previous criteria for  the Circling Approach Radius (CAR). For example, under  FAA Order 8260.3  Change 21, a sea level airport with  a 1,500 ft HAA will have CAT C CAR of 2.86 NM, a 1.16  NM   $(68.5\%)$   increase over pre-Change 21 CAR for CAT C.  This extra protected airspace can be used by the pilot to  maneuver the aircraft instead of being forced to use high  descent rates which are often necessary for high HAA  circling approaches.  

Most commercial operators dictate standard procedures for  conducting instrument approaches in their FAA-approved  manuals. These standards designate company callouts,  flight profiles, configurations, and other specific duties  for each flight deck crewmember during the conduct of  an instrument approach.  

# Instrument Approach Charts  

Beginning in February 2000, the FAA began issuing the  current format for instrument approach charts. This chart  was developed by the Department of Transportation  (DOT), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center and  is commonly referred to as the Pilot Briefing Information  format. The FAA chart format is presented in a logical order,  facilitating pilot briefing of the procedures. [Figure 4-3]  

# Approach Chart Naming Conventions  

Individual FAA charts are identified on both the top and  bottom of the page by their procedure name (based on the  NAVAIDs required for the final approach), runway served,  and airport location. The identifier for the airport is also  listed immediately after the airport name. [Figure 4-4]  

There are several types of approach procedures that may  cause some confusion for flight crews unfamiliar with the  naming conventions. Although specific information about  each type of approach is covered later in this chapter, listed  below are a few procedure names that can cause confusion.  

# Straight-In Procedures  

When two or more straight-in approaches with the same  type of guidance exist for a runway, a letter suffix is added  to the title of the approach so that it can be more easily  identified. These approach charts start with the letter Z  and continue in reverse alphabetical order. For example,  consider the (RNAV) (GPS) Z RWY 13C and RNAV (RNP) Y  RWY 13C approaches at Chicago Midway International  Airport. [Figure 4-5] Although these two approaches can  be flown with a global positioning system (GPS) to the

![](images/11f094b39ede7a01c75ee82620ffa9279df3e9786fdadc83349be787549c5f14.jpg)

same runway, they are significantly different (e.g., one is  a Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Authorization  Required (AR) formally known as SPECIAL AIRCRAFT &  AIRCREW AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED (SAAAR);” one has  circling minimums and the other does not; the minimums  are different; and the missed approaches are not the same).  The approach procedure labeled Z has lower landing  minimums than Y (some older charts may not reflect this).  

In this example, the LNAV MDA for the RNAV (GPS) Z RWY  13C has the lowest minimums of either approach due to  the differences in the final approach required obstacle  clearance (ROC) evaluation. This convention also eliminates  any confusion with approach procedures labeled A and  B, where only circling minimums are published. The  designation of two area navigation (RNAV) procedures  to the same runway can occur when it is desirable to  accommodate panel mounted GPS receivers and flight  management systems (FMSs), both with and without  vertical navigation (VNAV). It is also important to note that  only one of each type of approach for a runway, including  ILS, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), and non-directional  beacon (NDB) can be coded into a database.  

# Circling-Only Procedures  

Approaches that do not have straight-in landing minimums  are identified by the type of approach followed by a letter.  Examples in Figure 4-6 show four procedure titles at the  As  can  be  seen  from  the  example,  the  first  approach  of  this type created at the airport is labeled with the letter A,  and the lettering continues in alphabetical order. Typically,  circling only approaches are designed for one of the  following reasons:  

•   The final approach course alignment with the  runway centerline exceeds  $30^{\circ}$  .  •   The descent gradient is greater than 400 ft/NM from  the FAF to the threshold crossing height (TCH). When  this maximum gradient is exceeded, the circling  only approach procedure may be designed to meet  the gradient criteria limits. This does not preclude a  straight-in landing if a normal descent and landing  can be made in accordance with the applicable CFRs.  •   A runway is not clearly defined on the airfield.  

# Communications  

The communication strip provided near the top of FAA  approach charts gives flight crews the frequencies that  they can expect to be assigned during the approach.  The frequencies are listed in the logical order of use from  arrival to touchdown. Having this information immediately  available during the approach reduces the chances of a  loss of contact between ATC and flight crews during this  critical phase of flight.  

It is important for flight crews to understand their  responsibilities with regard to communications in the  various approach environments. There are numerous  differences in communication responsibilities when  operating into and out of airports without ATC towers  as compared to airports with control towers. Today’s  pilots face an increasing range of ATC environments and  conflicting traffic dangers, making approach briefing and  preplanning more critical. Individual company operating  manuals and SOPs dictate the duties for each crewmember.  

FAA AC 120-71, Standard Operating Procedures for Flight  Deck Crewmembers, contains the following concerning  ATC communications: SOPs should state who (Pilot Flying  (PF), Pilot Monitoring (PM), Flight Engineer (FE/SO)) handles  the radios for each phase of flight, as follows:  

•   PF makes input to aircraft/autopilot and/or verbally  states clearances while PM confirms input is what he  or she read back to ATC.  •   Any confusion in the flight deck is immediately  cleared up by requesting ATC confirmation.  •   If any crewmember is off the flight deck, all ATC  instructions are briefed upon his or her return. Or,  

![](images/1258866334f617f774c54c149e69b50ad8a05cac64d6ce00b1623c6a6921ffd0.jpg)  

Figure 4-6.  Procedures with circling landing minima.  

if any crewmember is off the flight deck, all ATC  instructions are written down until his or her return  and then passed to that crewmember upon return.  Similarly, if a crewmember is off ATC frequency when  making a precision approach (PA) announcement  or when talking on company frequency, all ATC  instructions are briefed upon his or her return.  

• 	 Company policy should address use of speakers,  headsets, boom microphone, and/or hand-held  microphone.  • 	 SOPs should state the altitude awareness company  policy on confirming assigned altitude.  

Example:  The PM acknowledges ATC altitude clearance. If  the aircraft is on the autopilot, then the PF makes input into  the autopilot/altitude alerter. PF points to the input while  stating the assigned altitude as he or she understands it.  The PM then points to the input stating aloud what he or  she understands the ATC clearance to be confirming that  the input and clearance match. If the aircraft is being hand- flown, then the PM makes the input into the altitude alerter/  autopilot, then points to the input and states clearance.  PF then points to the alerter stating aloud what he or she  understands the ATC clearance to be confirming that the  alerter and clearance match.  

Example:  If there is no altitude alerter in the aircraft, then  both pilots write down the clearance, confirm that they  have the same altitude, and then cross off the previously  assigned altitude.  

# Approach Control  

Approach control is responsible for controlling all  instrument flights operating within its area of responsibility.  Approach control may serve one or more airports. Control  is exercised primarily through direct pilot and controller  communication and airport surveillance radar (ASR). Prior  to arriving at the initial approach fix (IAF), instructions will  be received from the air route traffic control center (ARTCC)  to contact approach control on a specified frequency.  Where radar is approved for approach control service, it is  used not only for radar approaches, but also for vectors in  conjunction with published non-radar approaches using  conventional NAVAIDs or RNAV/GPS.  

When radar handoffs are initiated between the ARTCC  and approach control, or between two approach control  facilities, aircraft are cleared (with vertical separation) to  an outer fix most appropriate to the route being flown  and, if required, given holding instructions. Or, aircraft  are cleared to the airport or to a fix so located that the  handoff is completed prior to the time the aircraft reaches  the fix. When radar handoffs are used, successive arriving  flights may be handed off to approach control with radar  separation in lieu of vertical separation.  

After release to approach control, aircraft are vectored  to the final approach course. ATC occasionally vectors  the aircraft across the final approach course for spacing  requirements. The pilot is not expected to turn inbound  on the final approach course unless an approach clearance  has been issued. This clearance is normally issued with the  final vector for interception of the final approach course,  and the vector enables the pilot to establish the aircraft on  the final approach course prior to reaching the FAF.  

# Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)  

ARTCCs are approved for and may provide approach  control services to specific airports. The radar systems used  by these centers do not provide the same precision as an  ASR or precision approach radar (PAR) used by approach  control facilities and control towers, and the update rate  is not as fast. Therefore, pilots may be requested to report  established on the final approach course. Whether aircraft  are vectored to the appropriate final approach course or  provide their own navigation on published routes to it,  radar service is automatically terminated when the landing  is completed; or when instructed to change to advisory  frequency at airports without an operating ATC tower,  whichever occurs first. When arriving on an IFR flight plan  at an airport with an operating control tower, the flight  plan is closed automatically upon landing.  

The extent of services provided by approach control varies  greatly from location to location. The majority of Part 121  operations in the NAS use airports that have radar service  and approach control facilities to assist in the safe arrival  and departure of large numbers of aircraft. Many airports  do not have approach control facilities. It is important for  pilots to understand the differences between approaches  with and without an approach control facility. For example,  

![](images/eec45e87306a32d1058c85cc2e139c074b20c71279a6e65839495308769c04ac.jpg)  
Figure 4-7.  Durango approach and low altitude en route excerpt.  

consider the Durango, Colorado, ILS DME RWY 2 and low  altitude en route chart excerpt shown in Figure 4-7.  

# High or Lack of Minimum Vectoring Altitudes  (MVAs)  

Considering the fact that most modern commercial and  corporate aircraft are capable of direct, point-to-point flight,  it is increasingly important for pilots to understand the  limitations of ARTCC capabilities with regard to minimum  altitudes. There are many airports that are below the  coverage area of Center radar, and; therefore, off-route  transitions into the approach environment may require  that the aircraft be flown at a higher altitude than would  be required for an on-route transition. In the Durango  example, an airplane approaching from the northeast on  a direct route to the Durango VOR may be restricted to  a minimum IFR altitude (MIA) of 17,000 feet MSL due to  unavailability of Center radar coverage in that area at lower  altitudes. An arrival on V95 from the northeast would be  able to descend to a minimum en route altitude (MEA) of  12,000 feet, allowing a shallower transition to the approach  

environment. An off-route arrival may necessitate a descent  into holding in order to avoid an unstable approach to  Durango.  

# Lack of Approach Control Terrain Advisories  

Flight crews must understand that terrain clearance cannot  be assured by ATC when aircraft are operating at altitudes  that are not served by Center or approach radar. Recent  National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigations  have identified several accidents that involved controlled  flight into terrain (CFIT) by IFR rated and VFR pilots  operating under visual flight conditions at night in remote  areas. In many of these cases, the pilots were in contact with  ATC at the time of the accident and receiving radar service.  The pilots and controllers involved all appear to have been  unaware that the aircraft were in danger. Increased altitude  awareness and better preflight planning would likely have  prevented all of these accidents. How can pilots avoid  becoming involved in a CFIT accident?  

CFIT accidents are best avoided through proper preflight  planning.  

•   Terrain familiarization is critical to safe visual  operations at night. Use sectional charts or other  topographic references to ensure that your altitude  safely clears terrain and obstructions all along your  route.  •   In remote areas, especially in overcast or moonless  conditions, be aware that darkness may render visual  avoidance of high terrain nearly impossible and that  the absence of ground lights may result in loss of  horizon reference.  •   When planning a nighttime VFR flight, follow IFR  practices, such as climbing on a known safe course,  until well above surrounding terrain. Choose a  cruising altitude that provides terrain separation  similar to IFR flights (2,000 feet AGL in mountainous  areas and 1,000 feet above the ground in other areas.)  •   When receiving radar services, do not depend on ATC  to warn you of terrain hazards. Although controllers  try to warn pilots if they notice a hazardous situation,  they may not always be able to recognize that a  particular VFR aircraft is dangerously close to terrain.  •   When issued a heading along with an instruction to  “maintain  $\mathsf{V F R}_{}^{\prime\prime}$  be aware that the heading may not  provide adequate terrain clearance. If you have any  doubt about your ability to visually avoid terrain and  obstacles, advise ATC immediately and take action to  reach a safe altitude if necessary.  •   ATC radar software can provide limited prediction and  warning of terrain hazards, but the warning system  

is configured to protect IFR flights and is normally  suppressed for VFR aircraft. Controllers can activate  the warning system for VFR flights upon pilot request,  but it may produce numerous false alarms for aircraft  operating below the MIA, especially in en route center  airspace.  

•   If you fly at night, especially in remote or unlit areas,  consider whether a GPS-based terrain awareness unit  would improve your safety of flight.  

•   Lack of approach control traffic advisories—if radar  service is not available for the approach, the ability  of ATC to give flight crews accurate traffic advisories  is greatly diminished. In some cases, the common  traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) may be the only tool  available to enhance an IFR flight’s awareness of traffic  at the destination airport. Additionally, ATC will not  clear an IFR flight for an approach until the preceding  aircraft on the approach has cancelled IFR, either on  the ground, or airborne once in visual meteorological  conditions (VMC).  

# Airports With an ATC Tower  

Control towers are responsible for the safe, orderly, and  expeditious flow of all traffic that is landing, taking off,  operating on and in the vicinity of an airport and, when  the responsibility has been delegated, towers also provide  for the separation of IFR aircraft in terminal areas. Aircraft  that are departing IFR are integrated into the departure  sequence by the tower. Prior to takeoff, the tower controller  coordinates with departure control to assure adequate  aircraft spacing.  

# Airports Without A Control Tower  

From a communications standpoint, executing an  instrument approach to an airport that is not served by an  ATC tower requires more attention and care than making  a visual approach to that airport. Pilots are expected to  self-announce their arrival into the vicinity of the airport  no later than 10 NM from the field. Depending on the  weather, as well as the amount and type of conflicting  traffic that exists in the area, an approach to an airport  without an operating ATC tower increases the difficulty of  the transition to visual flight.  

In many cases, a flight arriving via an instrument approach  needs to mix in with VFR traffic operating in the vicinity  of the field. For this reason, many companies require that  flight crews make contact with the arrival airport CTAF or  company operations personnel via a secondary radio over  25 NM from the field in order to receive traffic advisories.  In addition, pilots should attempt to listen to the CTAF  well in advance of their arrival in order to determine the  VFR traffic situation.  

Since separation cannot be provided by ATC between  IFR and VFR traffic when operating in areas where there  is no radar coverage, pilots are expected to make radio  announcements on the CTAF. These announcements  allow other aircraft operating in the vicinity to plan their  departures and arrivals with a minimum of conflicts.  In addition, it is very important for crews to maintain a  listening watch on the CTAF to increase their awareness  of the current traffic situation. Flights inbound on an  instrument approach to a field without a control tower  should make several self-announced radio calls during  the approach:  

•   Initial call within 4-10 minutes of the aircraft’s arrival  at the IAF. This call should give the aircraft’s location  as well as the crew’s approach intentions.  

•   Departing the IAF, stating the approach that is being  initiated.  •   Procedure turn (or equivalent) inbound.  •   FAF inbound, stating intended landing runway and  maneuvering direction if circling.  •   Short final, giving traffic on the surface notification  of imminent landing.  

When operating on an IFR flight plan at an airport without  a functioning control tower, pilots must initiate cancellation  of the IFR flight plan with ATC or an AFSS. Remote  communications outlets (RCOs) or ground communications  outlets (GCOs), if available, can be used to contact an ARTCC  or an AFSS after landing. If a frequency is not available on  

![](images/8997938a8d70a4ee3fe926e077d0e36562094849e3a5b9171177f593cf2cf546.jpg)

the ground, the pilot has the option to cancel IFR while  in flight if VFR conditions can be maintained while in  contact with ARTCC, as long as those conditions can be  maintained until landing. Additionally, pilots can relay a  message through another aircraft or contact flight service  via telephone.  

# Primary NAVAID  

Most conventional approach procedures are built around  a primary final approach NAVAID; others, such as RNAV  (GPS) approaches, are not. If a primary NAVAID exists for  an approach, it should be included in the IAP briefing, set  into the appropriate backup or active navigation radio, and  positively identified at some point prior to being used for  course guidance. Adequate thought should be given to the  appropriate transition point for changing from FMS or other  en route navigation over to the conventional navigation to  be used on the approach. Specific company standards and  procedures normally dictate when this changeover occurs;  some carriers are authorized to use FMS course guidance  throughout the approach, provided that an indication  of the conventional navigation guidance is available  and displayed. Many carriers, or specific carrier fleets,  are required to change over from RNAV to conventional  navigation prior to the FAF of an instrument approach.  

Depending on the complexity of the approach procedure,  pilots may have to brief the transition from an initial NAVAID  to the primary and missed approach NAVAIDs. Figure 4-8  shows the Cheyenne, Wyoming, ILS Runway 27 approach  procedure, which requires additional consideration during  an IAP briefing.  

If the 15 DME arc of the CYS VOR is to be used as the  transition to this ILS approach procedure, caution must  be paid to the transition from en route navigation to the  initial NAVAID and then to the primary NAVAID for the ILS  approach. Planning when the transition to each of these  NAVAIDs occurs may prevent the use of the incorrect  NAVAID for course guidance during approaches where  high pilot workloads already exist.  

# Equipment Requirements  

The navigation equipment that is required to join and fly an  IAP is indicated by the title of the procedure and notes on  the chart. Straight-in IAPs are identified by the navigation  system by providing the final approach guidance and the  runway with which the approach is aligned (for example,  VOR RWY 13). Circling-only approaches are identified  by the navigation system by providing final approach  guidance and a letter (for example, VOR A). More than one  navigation system separated by a slant indicates that more  than one type of equipment must be used to execute the  final approach (for example, VOR/DME RWY 31). More than  one navigation system separated by the word“or”indicates  either type of equipment can be used to execute the final  approach (for example, VOR or GPS RWY 15).  

In some cases, other types of navigation systems,  including radar, are required to execute other portions of  the approach or to navigate to the IAF (for example, an  NDB procedure turn to an ILS, or an NDB in the missed  approach, or radar required to join the procedure or identify  a fix). When ATC radar or other equipment is required for  procedure entry from the en route environment, a note is  charted in the plan view of the approach procedure chart  (for example, RADAR REQUIRED or AUTOMATIC DIRECTION  FINDER (ADF) REQUIRED). When radar or other equipment  is required on portions of the procedure outside the final  approach segment, including the missed approach, a note  is charted in the notes box of the pilot briefing portion  of the approach chart (for example, RADAR REQUIRED or  DISTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT (DME) REQUIRED).  Notes are not charted when VOR is required outside the  final approach segment. Pilots should ensure that the  aircraft is equipped with the required NAVAIDs to execute  the approach, including the missed approach. Refer to the  AIM paragraph 5-4-5 for additional options with regards to  equipment requirements for IAPs.  

RNAV systems may be used as a Substitute Means of  Navigation when a very high frequency (VHF) Omni- directional Range (VOR), Distance Measuring Equipment 

 (DME), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), VOR/TACAN 

 (VORTAC), VOR/DME, non-directional radio beacon (NDB),  or compass locator facility including locator outer marker  and locator middle marker is out-of-service, i.e., the  Navigation Aid (NAVAID) information is not available; an  aircraft is not equipped with an automatic direction finder  (ADF) or DME; or the installed ADF or DME on an aircraft is  not operational. For example, if equipped with a suitable  RNAV system, a pilot may hold over an out-of-service NDB.  Refer to Advisory Circular 90-108, Use of Suitable RNAV  System on Conventional Routes and Procedures, dated  March 3, 2011 for additional guidance on the proper times  and procedures for substituting a RNAV system for means  of navigation.  

# Courses  

# Traditional Courses  

An aircraft that has been cleared to a holding fix and  subsequently “cleared…approach,” normally does not  receive new routing. Even though clearance for the  approach may have been issued prior to the aircraft  reaching the holding fix, ATC would expect the pilot to  proceed via the holding fix that was the last assigned route,  and the feeder route associated with that fix, if a feeder  route is published on the approach chart, to the IAF to  commence the approach. When cleared for the approach,  the published off-airway (feeder) routes that lead from  the en route structure to the IAF are part of the approach  clearance.  

If a feeder route to an IAF begins at a fix located along  the route of flight prior to reaching the holding fix,  and clearance for an approach is issued, a pilot should  commence the approach via the published feeder route.  For example, the aircraft would not be expected to overfly  the feeder route and return to it. The pilot is expected to  commence the approach in a similar manner at the IAF,  if the IAF for the procedure is located along the route of  flight to the holding fix.  

If a route of flight directly to the IAF is desired, it should  be so stated by the controller with phraseology to include  the words “direct,” “proceed direct,” or a similar phrase  that the pilot can interpret without question. When a  pilot is uncertain of the clearance, ATC should be queried  immediately as to what route of flight is preferred.  

The name of an instrument approach, as published, is  used to identify the approach, even if a component of the  approach aid is inoperative or unreliable. The controller  will use the name of the approach as published, but must  advise the aircraft at the time an approach clearance is  issued that the inoperative or unreliable approach aid  component is unusable. (Example: “Cleared ILS RWY 4,  glideslope unusable.”)  

# Area Navigation Courses  

RNAV (GPS) approach procedures introduce their own  tracking issues because they are flown using an onboard  navigation database. They may be flown as coupled  approaches or flown manually. In either case, navigation  system coding is based on procedure design, including  waypoint (WP) sequencing for an approach and missed  approach. The procedure design indicates whether the WP  is a fly-over (FO) or fly-by (FB), and provides appropriate  guidance for each. A FB WP requires the use of turn  anticipation to avoid overshooting the next flight segment.  A FO WP precludes any turn until the WP is over flown and  is followed by either an intercept maneuver of the next  flight segment or direct flight to the next WP.  

![](images/a2673b903ad523033e938f92269ef72e5c62a7f242c4c98b7fb46019df425cc4.jpg)  
Figure 4-9.  Fly-by and fly-over waypoints.  

Approach waypoints, except for the missed approach  waypoint (MAWP) and the missed approach holding  waypoint (MAHWP), are normally FB WPs. Notice that in the  plan view in Figure 4-9, there are four FB WPs, but only the  circled WP symbol at PRINO is a FO WP. If flying manually to  a selected RNAV WP, pilots should anticipate the turn at a FB  WP to ensure a smooth transition and avoid overshooting  the next flight segment. Alternatively, for a FO WP, no turn  is accomplished until the aircraft passes the WP.  

There are circumstances when a WP may be coded into the  database as both a FB WP and a FO WP, depending on how  the WPs are sequenced during the approach procedure. For  example, a WP that serves as an IAF may be coded as a FB  WP for the approach and as a FO WP when it also serves  as the MAWP for the missed approach procedure (MAP).  This is just one reason why instrument approaches should  be loaded in their entirety from the FMS and not manually  built or modified.  

# Altitudes  

Prescribed altitudes may be depicted in four different  configurations: minimum, maximum, recommended, and  mandatory. The U.S. Government distributes approach  charts produced by the FAA. Altitudes are depicted on  these charts in the profile view with an underscore or  overscore, or both to identify them as minimum, maximum,  or mandatory, respectively.  

•   Minimum altitudes are depicted with the altitude value  underscored. Aircraft are required to maintain altitude  at or above the depicted value (e.g., 3000). •   Maximum altitudes are depicted with the altitude value  overscored. Aircraft are required to maintain altitude  at or below the depicted value (e.g., 4800). •   Mandatory altitudes are depicted with the altitude value  both underscored and overscored. Aircraft are required  to maintain altitude at the depicted value (e.g.,  5500).  •   Recommended altitudes are depicted without an   underscore or overscore.  

Note:  Pilots are cautioned to adhere to altitudes as  prescribed because, in certain instances, they may be used  as the basis for vertical separation of aircraft by ATC. If a  depicted altitude is specified in the ATC clearance, that  altitude becomes mandatory as defined above.  

# Minimum Safe/Sector Altitude  

Minimum Safe Altitudes are published for emergency use  on IAP charts. MSAs provide 1,000 feet of clearance over  all obstacles but do not necessarily assure acceptable  navigation signal coverage. The MSA depiction on the plan  view of an approach chart contains the identifier of the  center point of the MSA, the applicable radius of the MSA,  a depiction of the sector(s), and the minimum altitudes  above mean sea level which provide obstacle clearance.  For conventional navigation systems, the MSA is normally  based on the primary omnidirectional facility on which the  IAP is predicated, but may be based on the airport reference  point (ARP) if no suitable facility is available. For RNAV  approaches, the MSA is based on an RNAV waypoint. MSAs  normally have a 25 NM radius; however, for conventional  navigation systems, this radius may be expanded to 30 NM  if necessary to encompass the airport landing surfaces.  

Depicted on the Plan View of approach charts, a single  sector altitude is normally established. However when it is  necessary to obtain obstacle clearance, an MSA area may  be further divided with up to four sectors.  

# Final Approach Fix Altitude  

Another important altitude that should be briefed during  an IAP briefing is the FAF altitude, designated by the cross  on a non-precision approach, and the lightning bolt symbol  designating the glideslope/glidepath intercept altitude on  a precision approach. Adherence and cross-check of this  altitude can have a direct effect on the success and safety  of an approach.  

Proper airspeed, altitude, and configuration, when crossing  the FAF of a non-precision approach, are extremely  important no matter what type of aircraft is being flown.  The stabilized approach concept, implemented by the  FAA within the SOPs of each air carrier, suggests that  crossing the FAF at the published altitude is often a critical  component of a successful non-precision approach,  especially in a large turbojet aircraft.  

The glideslope intercept altitude of a precision approach  should also be included in the IAP briefing. Awareness of  this altitude when intercepting the glideslope can ensure  the flight crew that a “false glideslope” or other erroneous  indication is not inadvertently followed. Many air carriers  include a standard callout when the aircraft passes over the  FAF of the non-precision approach underlying the ILS. The  PM states the name of the fix and the charted glideslope  altitude, thus allowing both pilots to cross-check their  respective altimeters and verify the correct indications.  

# Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA), Decision  Altitude (DA), And Decision Height (DH)  

MDA—the lowest altitude, expressed in feet MSL, to which  descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to­ land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument  approach procedure (SIAP) where no electronic glideslope  is provided.  

DA—a specified altitude in the precision approach at  which a missed approach must be initiated if the required  visual reference to continue the approach has not been  established.  

DH—with respect to the operation of aircraft, means the  height at which a decision must be made during an ILS, MLS,  or PAR IAP to either continue the approach or to execute a  missed approach.  

CAT II and III approach DHs are referenced to AGL and  measured with a radio altimeter.  

The height above touchdown (HAT) for a CAT I precision  approach is normally 200 feet above touchdown zone  elevation (TDZE). When a HAT of 250 feet or higher is  published, it may be the result of the signal-in-space  coverage, or there may be penetrations of either the final  or missed approach obstacle clearance surfaces (OCSs).  If there are OCS penetrations, the pilot has no indication  on the approach chart where the obstacles are located. It  is important for pilots to brief the MDA, DA, or DH so that  there is no ambiguity as to what minimums are being used.  These altitudes can be restricted by many factors. Approach  category, inoperative equipment in the aircraft or on the  ground, crew qualifications, and company authorizations  are all examples of issues that may limit or change the  height of a published MDA, DA, or DH.  

For many air carriers, OpSpecs may be the limiting factor  for some types of approaches. NDB and circling approaches  are two common examples where the OpSpecs minimum  listed altitudes may be more restrictive than the published  minimums. Many Part 121 and 135 operators are restricted  from conducting circling approaches below 1,000 feet  MDA and 3 SM visibility by Part C of their OpSpecs,  and many have specific visibility criteria listed for NDB  approaches that exceed visibilities published for the  approach (commonly 2 SM). In these cases, flight crews  must determine which is the more restrictive of the two  and comply with those minimums.  

In some cases, flight crew qualifications can be the limiting  factor for the MDA, DA, or DH for an instrument approach.  There are many CAT II and III approach procedures  authorized at airports throughout the United States, but  RNP AR restricts their use to pilots who have received  specific training, and aircraft that are equipped and  authorized to conduct those approaches. Other rules  pertaining to flight crew qualifications can also determine  the lowest usable MDA, DA, or DH for a specific approach.  14 CFR Part 121, § 121.652, 14 CFR Part 125, § 125.379,  and 14 CFR Part 135, § 135.225 require that some PICs,  with limited experience in the aircraft they are operating,  increase the approach minimums and visibility by 100  feet and one-half mile respectively. Rules for these “high­ minimums” pilots are usually derived from a combination  of federal regulations and the company’s OpSpecs. There  are many factors that can determine the actual minimums  that can be used for a specific approach. All of them must  be considered by pilots during the preflight and approach  planning phases, discussed, and briefed appropriately.  

Pilots are cautioned to fully understand and abide by the  guidelines set forth in 14 CFR § 91.175(c) regarding proper  identification of the runway and runway environment when  electing to continue any approach beyond the published  DA/DH or MDA.  

It is imperative to recognize that any delay in making a  decision to execute the Missed Approach Procedure at  the DA/DH or MDA/Missed Approach Point will put the  aircrew at risk of impacting any obstructions that may be  penetrating the visual obstacle clearance surface  

The visual segment of an IAP begins at DA or MDA and  continues to the runway. There are two means of operating  in the visual segment, one is by using natural vision under  14 CFR Part 91, § 91.175 (c) and the other is by using an  Enhanced Flight Vision System under 14 CFR Part 91, §  91.176.

# Enhanced Flight Vision Systems (EFVS) and  Instrument Approaches  [Figure 4-10A]  

An Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS) is an installed  aircraft system which uses a head up display (HUD), or an  equivalent display that is a head up presentation, to combine  aircraft flight information and flight symbology, navigation  guidance, and a real-time image of the external scene to  the pilot on a single display. Imaging sensors, which may  be based on forward-looking infrared (FLIR), millimeter  wave radiometry, millimeter wave radar, low-level light  intensification, or other real-time imaging technologies,  produce a real-time image of the outside scene. Combining  the flight information, navigation guidance, and sensor  imagery on a HUD or equivalent display allows the pilot to  continue looking forward along the flightpath throughout  the entire approach, landing, and rollout.  

Sections 91.175(c) and 91.176 specify two means of operating  visually below DA/DH or MDA in the visual segment of an  IAP . One means is by using natural vision under  $\S\,91.175(\mathsf{c}),$  ,  and the other is by using enhanced vision provided by an  EFVS under § 91.176. When the runway environment cannot  be visually acquired using natural vision, a pilot may use an  EFVS to continue descending below DA/DH or MDA under §  91.176. An EFVS operation is an operation in which visibility  conditions require an EFVS to be used in lieu of natural vision  to perform an approach or landing, determine enhanced  flight visibility, identify required visual references, or conduct  a rollout. There are two types of EFVS operations – EFVS  operations to touchdown and rollout and EFVS operations  to 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE). An  EFVS operation to touchdown and rollout is an operation in  which a pilot uses the enhanced vision imagery provided by  an EFVS in lieu of natural vision to descend below DA or DH to  touchdown and rollout [Figure 4-10B]. These operations may  be conducted on standard instrument approach procedures  (SIAPs) or special instrument approach procedures (IAPs) that  have a DA or DH (e.g., Precision or APV approach).  

![](images/bdac6b13ad4611575efe01978c312473c5191a9cc18a8c6d48918008da3aef49.jpg)  
Figure 4-10B.  EFVS Operation to Touchdown and Rollout.  

An EFVS operation to 100 feet above the TDZE is an  operation in which the pilot uses the EFVS in lieu of natural  vision to descend below DA/DH or MDA down to 100 feet  above the TDZE [Figure 4-10C]. To descend below 100 feet  above the TDZE, however, natural vision must be used. EFVS  operations to 100 feet above the TDZE may be conducted  on SIAPs or special IAPs that have a DA/DH or MDA.  

While the regulations do not prohibit EFVS from being used  during any phase of flight for situational awareness, EFVS  displays are not designed, installed, certified, or intended  as a sufficient visual system to conduct circling maneuvers.  EFVS may only be used during a circle-to-land maneuver  provided the visual references required throughout the  circling maneuver are distinctly visible to the pilot using  natural vision throughout the circling maneuver. Therefore,  an EFVS cannot be used to satisfy the requirement that an  identifiable part of the airport be distinctly visible to the  pilot during a circling maneuver at or above MDA or while  descending below MDA from a circling maneuver.  

The visual information provided by an EFVS serves as  independent verification of the position information  provided by the aircraft’s displays and systems. An EFVS  also enables a pilot to assess the enhanced flight visibility  and identify required visual references, helps a pilot align  the aircraft with the runway, and provides position, roll, rate  of closure, and distance remaining information. Sections  91.176(a) and 91.176(b) permit a pilot to use an EFVS to  identify the required visual references and to determine  that the enhanced flight visibility provided by the EFVS is  not less than the visibility prescribed in the IAP to be flown.  Both the visual reference and enhanced flight visibility  requirements of the regulations must be met before the  pilot can descend below DA/DH during an EFVS operation  to touchdown and rollout or below DA/DH or MDA during  an EFVS operation to 100 feet above the TDZE. The aircraft  also must continuously be in a position from which a  descent to landing can be made on the intended runway at  a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers. For EFVS  operations to touchdown, § 91.176(a)(2)(vi) requires that  the descent rate must allow touchdown to occur within the  touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing for all  operations. Section 91.176(b)(2)(v), operations conducted  to 100 feet above the TDZE, requires the descent rate to  allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of  the runway of intended landing for operations conducted  under 14 CFR Parts 121 and 135.  

![](images/a01b9d3d6ca09914f0406f1bbc8b40846e6d794228a3af1df52e0f5438f58dd3.jpg)  
Figure 4-10C. EFVS Operations to 100 Feet Above the TDZE.  

It is important to understand that using an EFVS does not  result in obtaining lower minima with respect to the visibility  or the DA/DH or MDA specified in the IAP. For example, a  pilot who is using an EFVS on a Category I ILS approach that  specifies a DA of 200 feet and a required visibility of RVR 2400  feet must comply with a 200-foot DA and an enhanced flight  visibility of 2400 feet, even though the pilot may not have  2400 feet of flight visibility using natural vision or a reported  visibility of RVR 2400 feet. The decision altitude is specified  by the IAP the pilot is flying, and it does not change whether  EFVS is used or not.  Accordingly, the visibility specified in  the IAP does not change. The difference is whether the pilot  assesses the RVR 2400 feet visibility prescribed by the IAP  using natural vision or whether he or she assesses it using an  EFVS. An EFVS simply provides another means of operating  in the visual segment of an IAP. That is, it gives the pilot  another means to see the required visual references when  they might not be visible using natural vision, and it gives  the pilot a means to see forward along the flightpath the  distance required by the enhanced flight visibility – when  he or she might not be able to do so using natural vision.  

During an EFVS operation, a pilot must initiate a go-around  at or below DA/DH or MDA whenever the requirements  of   $\S\ 91.176$   are not met. The published missed approach  procedure provides obstacle clearance only when the  missed approach is initiated from or above the DA/DH, or  at the MAP . It assumes a climb rate of 200 fT/NM unless a  higher climb gradient is identified on the procedure. If a  pilot initiates a go-around at a point below DA/DH or after  the MAP , obstacle clearance is not necessarily provided by  following the published missed approach procedure. Prior  planning is recommended and should include contingencies  between the published MAP and touchdown with reference  to obstacle clearance, aircraft performance, and alternate  escape plans. Additionally, pilots should be especially  knowledgeable of the approach conditions and approach  course alignment when considering whether to rely on  EFVS during an instrument approach with an offset final  approach course. Depending upon the combination of  crosswind correction, approach course offset, and the lateral  field of view provided by a particular EFVS, the required  visual references may or may not be within the pilot’s view  looking through the EFVS upon reaching the MAP. AC  90-106 (current version) contains additional information about visual segment obstacle clearance, missed approach  obstacle clearance, and considerations associated with offset  approaches.  

Operators that have a specific approval from the FAA to  conduct special IAPs should evaluate those instrument  procedures to determine their compatibility with EFVS  operations. Special IAPs are frequently dependent on the  ability of the operator to meet certain requirements that  may include aircraft performance, equipage, airport facility  equipment, crew training, or other requirements. These  

![](images/1cc4cb74950084a5886ae42ebd1ab36a609288cc49db7798386b3b261e907b3c.jpg)  

procedures also may have nonstandard features such as  nonstandard final approach course alignment, nonstandard  descent gradients, or other features that may or may not be  compatible with the conduct of EFVS operations.  

Under § 91.176(a), operators who have been issued OpSpec  C073, MSpec MC073, or LOA C073, may conduct EFVS  operations to touchdown and rollout on certain vertical  navigation (VNAV) IAPs that use an MDA as a DA/DH in  accordance with C073. Additionally, §§ 91.176 and 91.189  permit an authorized EFVS operation to be conducted  during an authorized Category II or Category III operation.  

Currently, EFVS operations in rotorcraft can be conducted  only on IAPs that are flown to a runway. Instrument approach  criteria, procedures, and appropriate visual references have  not yet been developed for straight-in landing operations  below DA/DH or MDA under IFR to heliports or platforms.  EFVS cannot be used in lieu of natural vision to descend  below published minimums on copter approaches to a  point-in-space (PinS) followed by a “proceed visual flight  rules   $(\mathsf{V F R})^{\prime\prime}$     visual segment, or on approaches designed  to a specific landing site using a “proceed visually” visual  segment.  

# Vertical Navigation  

One of the advantages of some GPS and multi-sensor FMS  RNAV avionics is the advisory VNAV capability. Traditionally,  the only way to get vertical path information during an  approach was to use a ground-based precision NAVAID.  Modern RNAV avionics can display an electronic vertical  path that provides a constant-rate descent to minimums.  

Since these systems are advisory and not primary guidance,  the pilot must continuously ensure the aircraft remains at  or above any published altitude constraint, including step­ down fix altitudes, using the primary barometric altimeter.  The pilots, aircraft, and operator must be approved to use  advisory VNAV inside the FAF on an instrument approach.  

VNAV information appears on selected conventional  nonprecision, GPS, and RNAV approaches (see “Types of  Approaches” later in this chapter). It normally consists of  two fixes (the FAF and the landing runway threshold), a  FAF crossing altitude, a vertical descent angle (VDA), and  may provide a visual descent point (VDP) [Figure 4-11A].  

The VDA provides the pilot with advisory information  not previously available on nonprecision approaches. It  provides a means for the pilot to establish a stabilized  descent from the FAF or step-down fix to the MDA.  Stabilized descent is a key factor in the reduction of  controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) incidents. However,  pilots should be aware that the published angle is for  information only − it is strictly advisory in nature. There is  no implicit additional obstacle protection below the MDA.  Pilots must still respect any published stepdown fixes and  the published MDA unless the visual cues stated 14 CFR   $\S~91.175$   are present, and they can visually acquire and   avoid both lit and unlit obstacles once below the MDA. The  presence of a VDA does not guarantee obstacle protection  in the visual segment and does not change any of the   requirements for flying a nonprecision approach.  

Pilots may use the published angle and estimated/actual  groundspeed to find a target rate of descent from the rate  of descent table published in the back of the U.S. Terminal  Procedures Publication. This rate of descent can be flown  with the Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI) in order to use  the VDA as an aid to flying a stabilized descent. No special  equipment is required.  

In rare cases, the LNAV minima may have a lower HAT  than minima with a glide path, due to the location of the  obstacles and the nonprecision MAP. This should serve as  a clear indication to the pilot that obstacles exist below  the MDA, which must be seen in order to ensure adequate  clearance. In those cases, the glide path may be treated  as a VDA and used to descend to the LNAV MDA, as long  as all of the rules for a nonprecision approach are applied  at the MDA.  

When there are obstacles in the visual area that could  cause an aircraft to destabilize the approach between  the MDA and touchdown, the IAP will not show a vertical  descent angle in the profile view. The charts currently  include the following statement: “Descent Angle NA” or  “Descent Angle NA-Obstacles” [Figure 4-11B ].  

![](images/8fd806059631fefc802990955c936c3ae64c2ecb07ae214dcdc54259413d4de9.jpg)

![](images/68dda694df7aff195a3962872fd4b41dbf76efa3542cb1f5945a757e813bcfc9.jpg)  

Like flying any other IAP, the pilot must see and avoid any  obstacles in the visual segment during transition to landing.  A constant-rate descent has many safety advantages over  non-precision approaches that require multiple level-offs at  stepdown fixes or manually calculating rates of descent. A  stabilized approach can be maintained from the FAF to the  landing when a constant-rate descent is used. Additionally,  the use of an electronic vertical path produced by onboard  avionics can serve to reduce CFIT, and minimize the  effects of visual illusions on approach and landing. Some  countries even mandate the use of continuous descent  final approaches (CDFAs) on non-precision approaches.  

# Wide Area Augmentation System  

The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) offers  an opportunity for airports to gain ILS like approach  capability without the purchase or installation of any  ground-based navigation equipment at the airport.  Today, WAAS is already being used at more than 900  runways across the United States to achieve minimums  as low as 200 feet height above HAT/one-half mile  visibility.  

# Benefits Of WAAS In The Airport Environment  

WAAS is a navigation service using a combination of GPS  satellites and the WAAS geostationary satellites to improve  the navigational service provided by GPS. WAAS achieved  initial operating capability (IOC) in 2003. The system is  owned and operated by the FAA and provided free of direct  user charges to users across the United States and most of  Canada and Mexico.  

WAAS improves the navigational system accuracy for  en route, terminal, and approach operations over all the  continental United States and significant portions of Alaska,  Canada, and Mexico. This new navigational technology  supports vertically-guided instrument approaches to all  qualifying runways in the United States. Vertically-guided  approaches reduce pilot workload and provide safety  benefits compared to non-precision approaches. The WAAS  enabled vertically guided approach procedures are called  LPV, which stands for “localizer performance with vertical  guidance,”and provide ILS equivalent approach minimums  as low as 200 feet at qualifying airports. Actual minimums  are based on an airport’s current infrastructure, as well as  an evaluation of any existing obstructions. The FAA plans to  publish 300 WAAS approach procedures per year to provide  service to all qualifying instrument runways within the NAS.  

# Advantages Of WAAS Enabled LPV Approaches  

The advantages of WAAS enabled LPV approaches include:  

•   LPV procedures have no requirement for ground- based transmitters at the airport. •   No consideration needs to be given to the placement  of navigation facility, maintenance of clear zones  

![](images/09345c391c606b806ee26c46d128ea36f83c1c1ac4ba9c66ea71b1ac36fc6b56.jpg)  

around the facility, or access to the facility for  maintenance.  •   LPV approaches eliminate the need for critical area limitations associated with an ILS. •   From a pilot’s viewpoint, an LPV approach looks   and flies like an ILS, but the WAAS approach is more  stable than that of an ILS. •   WAAS equipped users can fly RNAV and basic   required navigation performance (RNP) procedures,  as well as LPV procedures, and the avionics costs   are relatively inexpensive considering the total   navigation solution provided.  

RNAV (GPS) approach charts normally have four lines  of approach minimums: LPV, LNAV/VNAV, LNAV, and  Circling. Figure 4-12 shows how these minimums might  be presented on an approach chart, with the exception  of Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) Landing  System (GLS). This enables as many GPS equipped aircraft  to use the procedure as possible and provides operational  flexibility if WAAS becomes unavailable. Some aircraft may  only be equipped with GPS receivers so they can fly to the  LNAV MDA. Some aircraft equipped with GPS and FMS  (with approach-certified barometric vertical navigation, or  Baro-VNAV) can fly to the LNAV/VNAV MDA. Flying a WAAS  LPV approach requires an aircraft with WAAS-LPV avionics.  If for some reason the WAAS service becomes unavailable,  all GPS or WAAS equipped aircraft can revert to the LNAV  MDA and land safely using GPS only, which is available  nearly 100 percent of the time. Some locations will have  an LP line of minima on an RNAV (GPS) approach chart; but  the use of LP is being phased out. At locations with obstacle  penetrations in the missed approach segment, there might  be two lines of minima for the same type of navigation- one  line with higher approach minima without a specified climb  gradient and another line with lower approach minima with  a specified climb gradient in the event of missed approach.  

LPV identifies WAAS approach with vertical guidance (APV)  approach minimums with electronic lateral and vertical  guidance capability. LPV is used for approaches constructed  with WAAS criteria where the value for the vertical alarm  limit is more than 12 meters and less than 50 meters.  WAAS avionics equipment approved for LPV approaches is  required for this type of approach. The lateral guidance is  equivalent to localizer accuracy, and the protected area is  considerably smaller than the protected area for the present  LNAV and LNAV/VNAV lateral protection. Aircraft can fly this  minima line with a statement in the AFM that the installed  equipment supports LPV approaches.  In Figure 4-12, notice  the WAAS information shown in the top left corner of the  pilot briefing information on the chart depicted. Below the  term WAAS is the WAAS channel number (CH 56202), and  the WAAS approach identifier (W35A), indicating Runway  35L in this case, and then a letter to designate the first in a  series of procedures to that runway [Figure 4-12].  

LNAV/VNAV identifies APV minimums developed to  accommodate an RNAV IAP with vertical guidance, usually  provided by approach certified Baro-VNAV, but with vertical  and lateral integrity limits larger than a precision approach  or LPV. Many RNAV systems that have RNP 0.3 or less  approach capability are specifically approved in the AFM.  Airplanes that are commonly approved in these types of  operations include Boeing 737NG, 767, and 777, as well as  the Airbus A300 series. Landing minimums are shown as  DAs because the approaches are flown using an electronic  glide path. Other RNAV systems require special approval. In  some cases, the visibility minimums for LNAV/VNAV might  be greater than those for LNAV only. This situation occurs  because DA on the LNAV/VNAV vertical descent path is  farther away from the runway threshold than the LNAV  MDA missed approach point.  

Also shown in Figure 4-12, is the LNAV minimums line. This  minimum is for lateral navigation only, and the approach  minimum altitude is published as a MDA. LNAV provides  the same level of service as the present GPS stand alone  approaches. LNAV supports the following systems: WAAS,  when the navigation solution will not support vertical  navigation; and GPS navigation systems which are  presently authorized to conduct GPS approaches.  

Circling minimums that may be used with any type of  approach approved RNAV equipment when publication of  straight-in approach minimums is not possible.  

# Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS)  

The United States version of the Ground-Based  Augmentation System (GBAS) has traditionally been  referred to as the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).  The worldwide community has adopted GBAS as the official  term for this type of navigation system. To coincide with  international terminology, the FAA is also adopting the term  GBAS to be consistent with the international community.  GBAS is a ground-based augmentation to GPS that focuses  its service on the airport area (approximately a 20–30 mile  radius) for precision approach, DPs, and terminal area  operations. It broadcasts its correction message via a very  high frequency (VHF) radio data link from a ground-based  transmitter. GBAS yields the extremely high accuracy,  availability, and integrity necessary for Category I, II, and  III precision approachesand provides the ability for flexible,  curved approach paths. GBAS demonstrated accuracy is  less than one meter in both the horizontal and vertical  axis. [Figure 4-13]  

![](images/e7d0eab7188cd37b2be6af4c1af1a9151be38d183c5a5fe94465bbf8b9c28032.jpg)

![](images/0299530bf4c781b200588c0d4de3867e4b2808474f7ce288de1197bc2e38c7f3.jpg)  

![](images/3c32b9e327c7bc68d4e98e46a48142c6f9fecfe4cc49181cdf7bf78f552018d8.jpg)  

The GBAS augments the GPS to improve aircraft safety  during airport approaches and landings. It is expected  that the end state configuration will pinpoint the aircraft’s  position to within one meter or less with a significant  improvement in service flexibility and user operating costs.  

GBAS is comprised of ground equipment and avionics.  The ground equipment includes four reference receivers, a  GBAS ground facility, and a VHF data broadcast transmitter.  This ground equipment is complemented by GBAS avionics  installed on the aircraft. Signals from GPS satellites are  received by the GBAS GPS reference receivers (four  receivers for each GBAS) at the GBAS equipped airport.  The reference receivers calculate their position using GPS.  The GPS reference receivers and GBAS ground facility work  together to measure errors in GPS provided position.  

The GBAS ground facility produces a GBAS correction  message based on the difference between actual and GPS  calculated position. Included in this message is suitable  integrity parameters and approach path information.  This GBAS correction message is then sent to a VHF data  broadcast (VDB) transmitter. The VDB broadcasts the GBAS  signal throughout the GBAS coverage area to avionics in  GBAS equipped aircraft. GBAS provides its service to a  local area (approximately a 20–30 mile radius). The signal  coverage is designed support the aircraft’s transition from  en route airspace into and throughout the terminal area  airspace.  

The GBAS equipment in the aircraft uses the corrections  provided on position, velocity, and time to guide the  aircraft safely to the runway. This signal provides ILS look  alike guidance as low as 200 feet above touchdown.  GBAS will eventually support landings all the way to the  runway surface. Figure 4-14 is an example of a GBAS (LAAS)  approach into Newark, New Jersey.  

# Required Navigation Performance (RNP)  

The operational advantages of RNP include accuracy,  onboard performance monitoring and alerting which  provide increased navigation precision and lower  minimums than conventional RNAV. RNP DAs can be  as low as 250 feet with visibilities as low as   $3/4\,\,{\sf S M}$  .  Besides lower minimums, the benefits of RNP include  improved obstacle clearance limits, as well as reduced  pilot workload. When RNP capable aircraft fly an accurate,  repeatable path, ATC can be confident that these aircraft  are at a specific position, thus maximizing safety and  increasing capacity.  

To attain the benefits of RNP approach procedures, a key  component is curved flight tracks. Constant radius turns  around a fix are called “radius-to-fix legs (RF legs).”These  turns, which are encoded into the navigation database,  allow the aircraft to avoid critical areas of terrain or  conflicting airspace while preserving positional accuracy  by maintaining precise, positive course guidance along  the curved track. The introduction of RF legs into the  design of terminal RNAV procedures results in improved  use of airspace and allows procedures to be developed to  and from runways that are otherwise limited to traditional  linear flight paths or, in some cases, not served by an IFR  procedure at all. Navigation systems with RF capability  are a prerequisite to flying a procedure that includes an  RF leg. Refer to the notes box of the pilot briefing portion  of the approach chart in Figure 4-15.  

In the United States, operators who seek to take advantage  of RNP approach procedures must meet the special  RNP requirements outlined in FAA AC 90-101,  Approval  Guidance for RNP Procedures with Authorization Required  (AR). Currently, most new transport category airplanes  receive an airworthiness approval for RNP operations.  However, differences can exist in the level of precision that  each system is qualified to meet. Each individual operator  is responsible for obtaining the necessary approval and  authorization to use these instrument flight procedures  with navigation databases.  

# RNAV Approach Authorization  

Like any other authorization given to air carriers and Part 91  operators, the authorization to use VNAV on a conventional  non-precision approach, RNAV approaches, or LNAV/VNAV  approaches is found in that operator’s OpSpecs, AFM, or  other FAA-approved documents. There are many different  levels of authorizations when it comes to the use of RNAV  approach systems. The type of equipment installed in the  aircraft, the redundancy of that equipment, its operational  status, the level of flight crew training, and the level of the  operator’s FAA authorization are all factors that can affect  a pilot’s ability to use VNAV information on an approach.  

Because most Part 121, 125, 135, and 91 flight departments  include RNAV approach information in their pilot training  programs, a flight crew considering an approach to  North Platte, Nebraska, using the RNAV (GPS) RWY 30  approach shown in Figure 4-16, would already know which  minimums they were authorized to use. The company’s  OpSpecs, FOM, and the AFM for the pilot’s aircraft would  dictate the specific operational conditions and procedures  by which this type of approach could be flown.  

There are several items of note that are specific to this type  of approach that should be considered and briefed. One  is the terminal arrival area (TAA) that is displayed in the  approach planview. TAAs, discussed later in this chapter,  depict the boundaries of specific arrival areas, and the  MIA for those areas. The TAAs should be included in an  IAP briefing in the same manner as any other IFR transition  altitude. It is also important to note that the altitudes listed  in the TAAs should be referenced in place of the MSAs on  the approach chart for use in emergency situations.  

In addition to the obvious differences contained in the  planview of Figure 4-16, RNAV (GPS) approach procedure  example, pilots should be aware of the issues related to  Baro-VNAV and RNP . The notes section of the procedure in  the example contains restrictions relating to these topics.  

RNP values for each individual leg of the procedure, defined  by the procedure design criteria for containment purposes,  are encoded into the aircraft’s navigation database.  Applicable landing minimums are shown in a normal  manner along with the associated RNP value in the landing  minimums section.  

RNP required sensors, FMS capabilities, and relevant  procedure notes are included in the Pilot Briefing  Information procedure notes section. [Figure 4-15] RNP  AR requirements are highlighted in large, bold print.  RNP procedures are sequenced in the same manner as  RNAV (GPS) procedures. Procedure title “RNAV” includes  parenthetical  $\scriptstyle"(\mathsf{R N P})^{\prime\prime}$   terminology. RF legs can be used in  any segment of the procedure (transition, intermediate,  final, or missed approach). RF leg turn directions (left or  right) are not noted in the planview because the graphic  depiction of the flight tracks is intuitive. Likewise, the arc  center points, arc radius, and associated RF leg performance  limits, such as bank angles and speeds are not depicted  because these aircraft performance characteristics are  encoded in the navigation database. RNP values for each  individual leg of the procedure, defined by the procedure  design criteria for containment purposes, are encoded  into the aircraft's navigation database. Applicable landing  minimums are shown in a normal manner along with the  associated RNP value in the landing minimums section.  

When more than one set of RNP landing minimums is  available and an aircrew is able to achieve lower RNP  through approved means, the available (multiple) sets of  RNP minimums are listed with the lowest set shown first;  remaining sets shown in ascending order, based on the  RNP value. On this particular procedure, lateral and vertical  course guidance from the DA to the Runway Waypoint (LTP)  is provided by the aircraft’s FMS and onboard navigation  database; however, any continued flight below the DA  to the landing threshold is to be conducted under VMC.  [Figure 4-15]  

# Baro-VNAV  

Baro-VNAV is an RNAV system function that uses barometric  altitude information from the aircraft’s altimeter to  compute and present a vertical guidance path to the pilot.  The specified vertical path is computed as a geometric  path, typically computed between two waypoints or  an angle based computation from a single waypoint.  Operational approval must also be obtained for Baro−  VNAV systems to operate to the LNAV/VNAV minimums.  Baro−VNAV may not be authorized on some approaches  due to other factors, such as no local altimeter source being  available. Baro−VNAV is not authorized on LPV procedures.  

For the RNAV (GPS) RWY 30 approach, the note “DME/  DME RNP-0.3 NA” prohibits aircraft that use only DME/  DME sensors for RNAV from conducting the approach.  [Figure 4-16]  

Because these procedures can be flown with an approach  approved RNP system and  $\scriptstyle"{\mathsf{R N P}}^{\prime\prime}$  is not sensor specific, it  was necessary to add this note to make it clear that those  aircraft deriving RNP 0.3 using DME/DME only are not  authorized to conduct the procedure.

is DME/DME. The necessary DME NAVAID ground  infrastructure may or may not be available at the airport of  intended landing. The procedure designer has a computer  program for determining the usability of DME based on  geometry and coverage. Where FAA flight inspection  successfully determines that the coverage and accuracy of  DME facilities support RNP, and that the DME signal meets  inspection tolerances, although there are none currently  published, the note “DME/DME RNP 0.3 Authorized” would  be charted. Where DME facility availability is a factor, the  note would read, “DME/DME RNP 0.3 Authorized; ABC and  XYZ required,”meaning that ABC and XYZ DME facilities are  required to assure RNP 0.3.  

# Hot and Cold Temperature Limitations  

A minimum and maximum temperature limitation is  published on procedures that authorize Baro−VNAV  operation. These temperatures represent the airport  temperature above or below which Baro−VNAV is not  authorized to LNAV/VNAV minimums unless temperature  compensation can be accomplished. As an example,  the limitation will read, uncompensated Baro−VNAV NA  below   $-11\,^{\circ}\mathsf C$     $\left.12\,^{\circ}\mathsf{F}\right)$   or above  $49\,^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$     $.120\,^{\circ}\mathsf{F})$  . [Figure 4-15]  This information will be found in the upper left hand box  of the pilot briefing. When the temperature is above the  high temperature or below the low temperature limit,  Baro−VNAV may be used to provide a stabilized descent  to the LNAV MDA; however, extra caution should be used  in the visual segment to ensure a vertical correction is not  required. If the VGSI is aligned with the published glide  path, and the aircraft instruments indicate on glide path,  an above or below glide path indication on the VGSI may  indicate that temperature error is causing deviations to  the glide path. These deviations should be considered if  the approach is continued below the MDA.  

Many systems which apply Baro−VNAV temperature  compensation only correct for cold temperature. In this  case, the high temperature limitation still applies. Also,  temperature compensation may require activation by  maintenance personnel during installation in order to be  functional, even though the system has the feature. Some  systems may have a temperature correction capability,  but correct the Baro−altimeter all the time, rather than  just on the final, which would create conflicts with other  aircraft if the feature were activated. Pilots should be  aware of compensation capabilities of the system prior to  disregarding the temperature limitations. The information  can be seen in the notes section in Figure 4-16.  

In response to aviation industry concerns over cold weather  altimetry errors, the FAA conducted a risk analysis to  determine if current 14 CFR Part 97 instrument approach  procedures, in the NAS place aircraft at risk during cold  temperature operations. This study applied the coldest  recorded temperature at the given airports in the last five  years and specifically determined if there was a probability  that during these non-standard day operations, anticipated  altitude errors in a barometric altimetry system could  exceed the Required Obstacle Clearance (ROC) used on  procedure segment altitudes. If a probability of the ROC  being exceeded went above one percent on a segment  of the approach, a temperature restriction was applied to  that segment. In addition to the low probability that these  procedures will be required, the probability of the ROC  being exceeded precisely at an obstacle position is  extremely low, providing an even greater safety margin.  

Pilots need to  make an altitude correction to the published,  “at” , “at or above” and “at or below” altitudes on designated  segment(s) of IAPs listed at specific airports, on all  published procedures and runways, when the reported  airport temperature is at or below the published airport  cold temperature restriction.  

This list may also be found at the bottom of the, “Terminal  Procedures Basic Search” page found at:  http://www.faa.  gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital products/dtpp/  search/  

Pilots without temperature compensating aircraft  are responsible to calculate and make a manual cold- temperature altitude correction to the designated  segment(s) of the approach using the AIM 7-2-3, ICAO Cold  Temperature Error Table.  

No extrapolation above the 5000 ft column required. Pilots  should use the 5000 feet “height above airport in feet”  column for calculating corrections of greater than 5000  feet above reporting station. Pilots will add correction(s)  from the table to the segment altitude(s) and fly at the  new corrected altitude. PILOTS SHOULD NOT MAKE AN  ALTIMETER CHANGE to accomplish an altitude correction.  

Pilots with temperature compensating aircraft must ensure  the system is on and operating for each segment  requiring  an altitude correction. Pilots must ensure they are flying  at corrected altitude. If the system is not operating, the  pilot is responsible to calculate and apply a manual cold  weather altitude correction using the AIM 7-2-3 ICAO Cold  Temperature Error Table.  

Pilots must report cold temperature corrected altitudes  to Air Traffic Control (ATC) whenever applying a cold  temperature correction on an intermediate segment and/  or a published missed approach final altitude. This should  be done on initial radio contact with the ATC issuing  approach clearance. ATC requires this information in  order to ensure appropriate vertical separation between  known traffic. ATC will not beproviding a cold temperature  correction to Minimum Vectoring Altitudes (MVA). Pilots  must not apply cold temperature compensation to ATC  assigned altitudes or when flying on radar vectors in lieu  of a published missed approach procedure unless cleared  by ATC.  

Pilots should query ATC when vectors to an intermediate  segment are lower than the requested intermediate  segment altitude corrected for temperature. Pilots are  encouraged to self-announce corrected altitude when  flying into uncontrolled airfields.  

The following are examples of appropriate pilot-to-ATC  communication when applying cold-temperature altitude  corrections:  

On initial check-in with ATC providing approach clearance:  Hayden, CO (example below).  

Intermediate segment: “Require 10600 ft. for cold  temperature operations until BEEAR” ,  

Missed Approach segment: “Require final holding altitude,  10600 ft. on missed approach for cold temperature  operations”  

Pilots cleared by ATC for an instrument approach  procedure; “Cleared the RNAV RWY 28 approach (from any  IAF)” . Hayden, CO (example below).  

Intermediate Segment:  “Level 10600 ft for cold temperature  operations inside HIPNA to BEEAR”  

Pilots are not required to advise ATC if correcting on the  final segment only.  Pilots must use the corrected MDA or  DA/DH as the minimum for an approach. Pilots must meet  the requirements in 14 CFR Part 91.175 in order to operate  below the corrected MDA or DA/DH. Pilots must see and  

avoid obstacles when descending below the MDA.  The temperature restriction at a “Cold Temperature  Restricted Airport” is mutually exclusive from the charted  temperature restriction published for “uncompensated  baro-VNAV systems” on 14 CFR Part 97 RNAV (GPS) and  RNAV (RNP) approach charts. The charted temperature  restriction for uncompensated baro-VNAV systems is  applicable to the final segment LNAV/VNAV minima.  The charted temperature restriction must be followed  regardless of the cold temperature restricted airport  temperature.  

Pilots are not required to calculate a cold temperature  altitude correction at any airport with a runway length of  2,500 feet or greater that is not included in the airports list  found at the URL above. Pilots operating into an airport  with a runway length less than 2,500 feet, may make a  cold temperature altitude correction in cold temperature  conditions.  

Cold Temperature Restricted Airports: These airports are  listed in the FAA Notices To Airmen Publication (NTAP)  found here:  https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/  notices/ .  

Airports are listed by ICAO code, Airport Name, Temperature  Restriction in Celsius/Fahrenheit and affected Segment.  One temperature may apply to multiple segments.  Italicized airports have two affected segments, each  with a different temperature restrictions. The warmest  temperature will be indicated on Airport IAPs next to a  snowflake symbol,  in the United States Terminal  Procedure Publication. The ICON will be added to the TPPs  incrementally each charting cycle.  

# LNAV, LNAV/VNAV and Circling Minimums  

There are some RNAV procedures with lower non-precision  LNAV minimums [Figure 4-17] than vertically-guided  LNAV/VNAV minimums.  Circling procedures found on  the same approach chart may also have lower minimums  than the vertically-guided LNAV/VNAV procedure.  Each  RNAV procedure is evaluated independently and different  approach segments have differing required obstacle  clearance (ROC) values, obstacle evaluation area (OEA)  dimensions and final segment types. Figure 4-18 explains  the differences.  

# Airport/Runway Information  

Another important piece of a thorough approach briefing  is the discussion of the airport and runway environment.  A detailed examination of the runway length (this must  include the A/FD section of the CS for the landing distance  available), the intended turnoff taxiway, and the route of  taxi to the parking area, are all important briefing items.  In addition, runway conditions should be discussed. The  effect on the aircraft’s performance must be considered if  the runway is contaminated.  

FAA approach charts include a runway sketch on each  approach chart to make important airport information  easily accessible to pilots. In addition, at airports that have  complex runway/taxiway configurations, a separate full- page airport diagram is published.  

The airport diagram also includes the latitude/longitude  information required for initial programming of FMS  equipment. The included latitude/longitude grid shows the  specific location of each parking area on the airport surface  for use in initializing FMS. Figure 4-19  shows the airport  sketch and diagram for Chicago-O’Hare International  Airport (KORD).  

Pilots making approaches to airports that have this type of  complex runway and taxiway configuration must ensure  that they are familiar with the airport diagram prior to  initiating an instrument approach. A combination of poor  weather, high traffic volume, and high ground controller  workload makes the pilot’s job on the ground every bit as  critical as the one just performed in the air.  

Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) Briefing  

A thorough instrument approach briefing greatly increases  the likelihood of a successful instrument approach. Most  Part 121, 125, and 135 operators designate specific items  to be included in an IAP briefing, as well as the order in  which those items are briefed.  

Before an IAP briefing can begin, flight crews must decide  which procedure is most likely to be flown from the  information that is available to them. Most often, when  the flight is being conducted into an airport that has  ATIS information, the ATIS provides the pilots with the  approaches that are in use. If more than one approach  is in use, the flight crew may have to make an educated  guess as to which approach will be issued to them based  on the weather, direction of their arrival into the area, any  published airport NOTAMs, and previous contact with the  approach control facility. Aircrews can query ATC as to  which approach is to be expected from the controller. Pilots  may request specific approaches to meet the individual  needs of their equipment or regulatory restrictions at any  time and ATC will, in most cases, be able to accommodate  those requests, providing that workload and traffic permit.  

If the flight is operating into an airport without a control  tower, the flight crew is occasionally given the choice of  any available instrument approach at the field. In these  cases, the flight crew must choose an appropriate approach  based on the expected weather, aircraft performance,  direction of arrival, airport NOTAMs, and previous  experience at the airport.  

# Navigation and Communication Radios  

Once the anticipated approach and runway have been  selected, each crewmember sets up their side of the flight  deck. The pilots use information gathered from ATIS,  dispatch (if available), ATC, the specific approach chart  for the approach selected, and any other sources that  are available. Company regulations dictate how certain  things are set up and others are left up to pilot technique.  In general, the techniques used at most companies are  similar. This section addresses two-pilot operations. During  single-pilot IFR flights, the same items must be set up and  the pilot should still do an approach briefing to verify that  everything is set up correctly.  

The number of items that can be set up ahead of time  depends on the level of automation of the aircraft and the  avionics available. In a conventional flight deck, the only  things that can be set up, in general, are the airspeed bugs  (based on performance calculations), altimeter bug (to DA,  DH, or MDA), go around thrust/power setting, the radio  altimeter bug (if installed and needed for the approach),  and the navigation/communication radios (if a standby  frequency selector is available). The standby side of the PF  navigation radio should be set to the primary NAVAID for  the approach and the PM navigation radio standby selector  should be set to any other NAVAIDs that are required or  available, and as dictated by company procedures, to  add to the overall situational awareness of the crew. The  ADF should also be tuned to an appropriate frequency  as required by the approach, or as selected by the crew.  Aircrews should, as much as possible, set up the instruments  for best success in the event of a vacuum or electrical failure.  For example, if the aircraft will only display Nav 1 on battery  or emergency power, aircrews should ensure that Nav 1 is  configured to the primary NAVAID for the final approach  to be flown.  

# Flight Management System (FMS)  

In addition to the items that are available on a conventional  flight deck aircraft, glass flight deck aircraft, as well as  aircraft with an approved RNAV (GPS) system, usually  give the crew the ability to set the final approach course  for the approach selected and many other options to  increase situational awareness. Crews of FMS equipped  aircraft have many options available as far as setting up  the flight management computer (FMC), depending on  the type of approach and company procedures. The PF  usually programs the FMC for the approach and the PM  verifies the information. A menu of available approaches  is usually available to select from based on the destination  airport programmed at the beginning of the flight or a new  destination selected while en route.  

The amount of information provided for the approach  varies from aircraft to aircraft, but the crew can make  modifications if something is not pre-programmed into the  computer, such as adding a MAP or even building an entire  approach for situational awareness purposes only. The PF  can also program a VNAV profile for the descent and LNAV  for segments that were not programmed during preflight,  such as a standard terminal arrival route (STAR) or expected  route to the planned approach. Any crossing restrictions  for the STAR might need to be programmed as well. The  most common crossing restrictions, whether mandatory  or “to be expected,” are usually automatically programmed  when the STAR is selected, but can be changed by ATC at  any time. Other items that need to be set up are dictated  by aircraft-specific procedures, such as autopilot, auto- throttles, auto-brakes, pressurization system, fuel system,  seat belt signs, anti-icing/ deicing equipment, and igniters.  

# Autopilot Modes  

In general, an autopilot can be used to fly approaches  even if the FMC is inoperative (refer to the specific aircraft’s  minimum equipment list (MEL) to determine authorization  for operating with the FMC inoperative). Whether or not the  FMC is available, use of the autopilot should be discussed  during the approach briefing, especially regarding the use  of the altitude pre-selector and auto-throttles, if equipped.  The AFM for the specific aircraft outlines procedures and  limitations required for the use of the autopilot during an  instrument approach in that aircraft.  

There are just as many different autopilot modes to climb  or descend the aircraft, as there are terms for these modes.  Some examples are level change (LVL CHG), vertical speed  (V/S), VNAV, and takeoff/go around (TO/GA). The pilot  controls the aircraft through the autopilot by selecting  pitch modes and/or roll modes, as well as the associated  auto-throttle modes. This panel, sometimes called a mode  control panel, is normally accessible to both pilots. Most  aircraft with sophisticated auto-flight systems and auto- throttles have the capability to select modes that climb  with maximum climb thrust and descend with the throttles  at idle (LVL CHG, flight level change (FL CHG), and manage  level). They also have the capability to capture, or level  off at pre-selected altitudes, as well as track a LOC and  glideslope   $({\sf G}/{\sf S})$   or a VOR course. If the aircraft is RNAV- equipped, the autopilot also tracks the RNAV-generated  course. Most of these modes are used at some point during  an instrument approach using the autopilot. Additionally,  these modes can be used to provide flight director (FD)  guidance to the pilot while hand-flying the aircraft.  

For the purposes of this precision approach example, the  auto-throttles are engaged when the autopilot is engaged  and specific airspeed and configuration changes are not  discussed. The PF controls airspeed with the speed selector  on the mode control panel and calls for flaps and landing  gear as needed, which the PM selects. The example in  Figure 4-20  begins with the airplane 5 NM northwest of  KNUCK at 4,500 feet with the autopilot engaged, and the  flight has been cleared to track the Rwy 12 LOC inbound.  The current roll mode is LOC with the PF’s NAV radio tuned  to the LOC frequency of 109.3; and the current pitch mode  is altitude hold (ALT HOLD). Approach control clears the  aircraft for the approach. The PF makes no immediate  change to the autopilot mode to prevent the aircraft from  capturing a false glideslope; but the PM resets the altitude  selector to 1,700 feet. The aircraft remains level because  the pitch mode remains in ALT HOLD until another pitch  mode is selected. Upon reaching KNUCK, the PF selects  LVL CHG as the pitch mode. The auto-throttles retard to  idle as the airplane begins a descent. Approaching 1,700  feet, the pitch mode automatically changes to altitude  acquire (ALT ACQ) then to ALT HOLD as the aircraft levels  at 1,700 feet. In addition to slowing the aircraft and calling  for configuration changes, the PF selects approach mode  (APP). The roll mode continues to track the LOC and the  pitch mode remains in ALT HOLD; however, the  $\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{S}$   mode  arms. Selecting APP once the aircraft has leveled at the  FAF altitude is a suggested technique to ensure that the  aircraft captures the glideslope from below and that a false  glideslope is not being tracked.  

The PF should have the aircraft fully configured for landing  before intercepting the glideslope to ensure a stabilized  approach. As the aircraft intercepts the glideslope the pitch  mode changes to   $\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{S}$  . Once the glideslope is captured  by the autopilot, the PM can select the missed approach  altitude in the altitude pre-selector, as requested by the PF.  The aircraft continues to track the glideslope. The minimum  altitude at which the PF is authorized to disconnect the  autopilot is aircraft specific. For example, 50 feet below  DA, DH, or MDA but not less than 50 feet AGL. The PF can  disconnect the autopilot at any time prior to reaching  this altitude during a CAT I approach. The initial missed  approach is normally hand flown with FD guidance unless  both autopilots are engaged for auto-land during a CAT II  or III approach.  

The differences when flying the underlying non-precision  approach begin when the aircraft has leveled off at 1,700  feet. Once ALT HOLD is annunciated, the MDA is selected  by the PM as requested by the PF. It is extremely important  for both pilots to be absolutely sure that the correct  altitude is selected for the MDA so that the aircraft does not  inadvertently descend below the MDA. For aircraft that the  altitude pre-selector can only select 100 foot increments,  the MDA for this approach must be set at 700 feet instead  of 660 feet.  

Vertical speed mode is used from the FAF inbound to  allow for more precise control of the descent. If the pilots  had not selected the MDA in the altitude pre-selector  window, the PF would not be able to input a V/S and the  aircraft would remain level. The autopilot mode changes  from ALT ACQ to ALT HOLD as the aircraft levels at 700 feet.  Once ALT HOLD is annunciated, the PF calls for the missed  approach altitude of 5,000 feet to be selected in the altitude  pre-selector window. This step is very important because  accurate FD guidance is not available to the PF during a  missed approach if the MDA is left in the window.  

Note: See“Maximum Acceptable Descent Rates”under the  heading “Descent Rates and Glide paths for Non-precision  Approaches.”  

# Descents  

# Stabilized Approach  

In IMC, you must continuously evaluate instrument  information throughout an approach to properly maneuver  the aircraft or monitor autopilot performance and to decide  on the proper course of action at the decision point (DA,  DH, or MAP). Significant speed and configuration changes  during an approach can seriously degrade situational  awareness and complicate the decision of the proper action  to take at the decision point. The swept wing handling  characteristics at low airspeeds and slow engine response  of many turbojets further complicate pilot tasks during  approach and landing operations. You must begin to form  a decision concerning the probable success of an approach  before reaching the decision point. Your decision-making  process requires you to be able to determine displacements  from the course or glideslope/glidepath centerline, to  mentally project the aircraft’s three-dimensional flight path  by referring to flight instruments, and then apply control  inputs as necessary to achieve and maintain the desired  approach path. This process is simplified by maintaining a  constant approach speed, descent rate, vertical flight path,  and configuration during the final stages of an approach.  This is referred to as the stabilized approach concept.  

A stabilized approach is essential for safe turbojet operations  and commercial turbojet operators must establish and  use procedures that result in stabilized approaches. A  stabilized approach is also strongly recommended for  propeller-driven airplanes and helicopters. You should limit  configuration changes at low altitudes to those changes  that can be easily accommodated without adversely  affecting your workload. For turbojets, the aircraft must  be in an approved configuration for landing or circling,  if appropriate, with the engines spooled up, and on the  correct speed and flight path with a descent rate of less  than 1,000 fpm before descending below the following  minimum stabilized approach heights:  

•   For all straight-in instrument approaches, to include  contact approaches in IFR weather conditions, the approach must be stabilized before descending below 1,000 feet above the airport or TDZE.  

•   For visual approaches and straight-in instrument approaches in VFR weather conditions, the approach  must be stabilized before descending below 500 feet  above the airport elevation.  

•   For the final segment of a circling approach maneuver, the approach must be stabilized 500 feet  above the airport elevation or at the MDA, whichever  is lower. These conditions must be maintained throughout the approach until touchdown for the approach to be considered a stabilized approach. This also helps you to recognize a wind shear situation should abnormal indications exist during the approach.  

# Descent Rates and Glidepaths for Nonprecision  Approaches  

# Maximum Acceptable Descent Rates  

Operational experience and research have shown that a  descent rate of greater than approximately 1,000 fpm is  unacceptable during the final stages of an approach (below  1,000 feet AGL). This is due to a human perceptual limitation  that is independent of the type of airplane or helicopter.  Therefore, the operational practices and techniques must  ensure that descent rates greater than 1,000 fpm are not  permitted in either the instrument or visual portions of an  approach and landing operation.  

For short runways, arriving at the MDA at the MAP when  the MAP is located at the threshold may require a missed  approach for some aircraft. For non-precision approaches,  a descent rate should be used that ensures the aircraft  reaches the MDA at a distance from the threshold that  allows landing in the TDZ. On many   $|\mathsf{A P s},$   this distance is  annotated by a VDP. If no VDP is annotated, calculate a  normal descent point to the TDZ. To determine the required  rate of descent, subtract the TDZE from the FAF altitude  and divide this by the time inbound. For example, if the  FAF altitude is 2,000 feet MSL, the TDZE is 400 feet MSL  and the time inbound is two minutes, an 800 fpm rate of  descent should be used.  

To verify the aircraft is on an approximate three degree  glidepath, use a calculation of 300 feet to 1 NM. The  glidepath height above TDZE is calculated by multiplying  the NM distance from the threshold by 300. For example,  at 10 NM the aircraft should be 3,000 feet above the TDZE,  at 5 NM the aircraft should be 1,500 feet above the TDZE,  at 2 NM the aircraft should be 600 feet above the TDZE, and  at   $1.5\:\mathsf{N M}$   the aircraft should be 450 feet above the TDZE  until a safe landing can be made. Using the example in the  previous text, the aircraft should arrive at the MDA (800  

![](images/10b32b90a5ce14a89702748e2c0769337b49842568d72d367e9ae3b325be7e10.jpg)  

feet MSL) approximately 1.3 NM from the threshold and in  a position to land within the TDZ. Techniques for deriving a  300-to-1 glide path include using DME, distance advisories  provided by radar-equipped control towers, RNAV, GPS,   dead reckoning, and pilotage when familiar features on the  approach course are visible. The runway threshold should   be crossed at a nominal height of 50 feet above the TDZE.  

# Transition to a Visual Approach  

The transition from instrument flight to visual flight during  an instrument approach can be very challenging, especially  during low visibility operations. Aircrews should use caution  when transitioning to a visual approach at times of shallow  fog. Adequate visibility may not exist to allow flaring of  the aircraft. Aircrews must always be prepared to execute  a missed approach/go-around. Additionally, single-pilot  operations make the transition even more challenging.  Approaches with vertical guidance add to the safety of  the transition to visual because the approach is already  stabilized upon visually acquiring the required references  for the runway. 100 to 200 feet prior to reaching the DA,  DH, or MDA, most of the PM’s attention should be outside  of the aircraft in order to visually acquire at least one visual  reference for the runway, as required by the regulations.  The PF should stay focused on the instruments until the  PM calls out any visual aids that can be seen, or states  “runway in sight.”The PF should then begin the transition  to visual flight. It is common practice for the PM to call out  the V/S during the transition to confirm to the PF that the  instruments are being monitored, thus allowing more of  the PF’s attention to be focused on the visual portion of the  approach and landing. Any deviations from the stabilized  approach criteria should also be announced by the PM.  

Single-pilot operations can be much more challenging  because the pilot must continue to fly by the instruments  while attempting to acquire a visual reference for the  runway. While it is important for both pilots of a two-pilot  aircraft to divide their attention between the instruments  and visual references, it is even more critical for the  single- pilot operation. The flight visibility must also be  at least the visibility minimum stated on the instrument  approach chart, or as required by regulations. CAT II and III  approaches have specific requirements that may differ from  CAT I precision or non-precision approach requirements  regarding transition to visual and landing. This information  can be found in the operator’s OpSpecs or FOM.  

The visibility published on an approach chart is dependent  on many variables, including the height above touchdown  for straight-in approaches or height above airport elevation  for circling approaches. Other factors include the approach  light system coverage, and type of approach procedure,

Figure 4-21.  Determination of visibility minimums.  

such as precision, non-precision, circling or straight-in.  Another factor determining the minimum visibility is the  penetration of the 34:1 and 20:1 surfaces. These surfaces  are inclined planes that begin 200 feet out from the runway  and extend outward to the DA point (for approaches with  vertical guidance), the VDP location (for non-precision  approaches) and 10,000 feet for an evaluation to a circling  runway. If there is a penetration of the 34:1 surface, the  published visibility can be no lower than three-fourths SM.  If there is penetration of the 20:1 surface, the published  visibility can be no lower than 1 SM with a note prohibiting  approaches to the affected runway at night (both straight- in and circling). [Figure 4-21 ] Circling may be permitted  at night if penetrating obstacles are marked and lighted.  If the penetrating obstacles are not marked and lighted,  a note is published that night circling is “Not Authorized.”  Pilots should be aware of these penetrating obstacles  when entering the visual and/or circling segments of an  approach and take adequate precautions to avoid them.  For RNAV approaches only, the presence of a grey shaded  line from the MDA to the runway symbol in the profile view  is an indication that the visual segment below the MDA is  clear of obstructions on the 34:1 slope. Absence of the gray  shaded area indicates the 34:1 OCS is not free of obstructions.  [Figure 4-22]  

# Missed Approach  

Many reasons exist for executing a missed approach. The  primary reasons, of course, are that the required flight  visibility prescribed in the IAP being used does not exist  when natural vision is used under 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.175c,  the required enhanced flight visibility is less than that  prescribed in the IAP when an EFVS is used under 14 CFR  Part 91, § 91.176, or the required visual references for the  runway cannot be seen upon arrival at the DA, DH, or  MAP. In addition, according to 14 CFR Part 91, the aircraft  must continuously be in a position from which a descent  to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a  

Figure 4-22.  RNAV approach Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  

normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers, and for  operations conducted under Part 121 or 135, unless that  descent rate allows touchdown to occur within the TDZ of  the runway of intended landing. CAT II and III approaches  call for different visibility requirements as prescribed by  the FAA Administrator.  

Prior to initiating an instrument approach procedure,  the pilot should assess the actions to be taken in the  event of a balked (rejected) landing beyond the missed  approach point or below the MDA or DA (H) considering  the anticipated weather conditions and available aircraft  performance. 14 CFR 91.175(e) authorizes the pilot to  fly an appropriate missed approach procedure that  ensures obstruction clearance, but it does not necessarily  consider separation from other air traffic. The pilot must  consider other factors such as the aircraft’s geographical  location with respect to the prescribed missed approach  point, direction of flight, and/ or the minimum turning  altitudes in the prescribed missed approach procedure.  The pilot must also consider aircraft performance, visual  climb restrictions, charted obstacles, published obstacle  departure procedure, takeoff visual climb requirements  as expressed by nonstandard takeoff minima, other traffic  expected to be in the vicinity, or other factors not  specifically expressed by the approach procedures.  

A clearance for an instrument approach procedure  includes a clearance to fly the published missed  approach procedure, unless otherwise instructed  by ATC. Once descent below the DA, DH, or MDA is  begun, a missed approach must be executed if the  required visibility is lost or the runway environment is  no longer visible, unless the loss of sight of the runway  is a result of normal banking of the aircraft during a  circling approach. A MAP is also required upon the  execution of a rejected landing for any reason, such  as men and equipment or animals on the runway, or  if the approach becomes unstabilized and a normal  landing cannot be performed. After the MAP in the  visual segment of a non-precision approach, there may  be hazards when executing a missed approach below  the MDA. The published missed approach procedure  provides obstacle clearance only when the missed  approach is conducted on the missed approach  segment from or above the missed approach point,  and assumes a climb rate of 200 ft/NM or higher, as  published. If the aircraft initiates a missed approach  at a point other than the missed approach point, from  below MDA or DA (H), or on a circling approach, obstacle  clearance is not provided  by following the published  missed approach procedure, nor is separation assured from  other air traffic in the vicinity.  

The missed approach climb is normally executed at the  MAP. If such a climb is initiated at a higher altitude prior  to the MAP, pilots must be aware of any published climb- altitude limitations, which must be accounted for when  commencing an early climb.  Figure 4-23  gives an example  of an altitude restriction that would prevent a climb  between the FAF and MAP. In this situation, the Orlando  Executive ILS or LOC RWY 7 approach altitude is restricted  at the BUVAY 3 DME fix to prevent aircraft from penetrating  the overlying protected airspace for approach routes into  Orlando International Airport. If a missed approach is  initiated before reaching BUVAY, a pilot may be required  to continue descent to 1,200 feet before proceeding  to the MAP and executing the missed approach climb  instructions. In addition to the missed approach notes  on the chart, the Pilot Briefing Information icons in the  profile view indicate the initial vertical and lateral missed  approach guidance.  

The missed approach course begins at the MAP and  continues until the aircraft has reached the designated  fix and a holding pattern has been entered. [Figure 4-24]  In these circumstances, ATC normally issues further  instructions before the aircraft reaches the final fix of  the missed approach course. It is also common for the  designated fix to be an IAF so that another approach  attempt can be made without having to fly from the  holding fix to an IAF.  

In the event a balked (rejected) landing occurs at a position  other than the published missed approach point, the  pilot should contact ATC as soon as possible to obtain an  amended clearance. If unable to contact ATC for any reason,  the pilot should attempt to re−intercept a published  segment of the missed approach and comply with route  and altitude instructions. If unable to contact ATC, and  in the pilot’s judgment it is no longer appropriate to fly  the published missed approach procedure, then consider  either maintaining visual conditions (if possible) and  reattempt a landing, or a circle−climb over the airport.  Should a missed approach become necessary when  operating to an airport that is not served by an operating  control tower, continuous contact with an air traffic facility  may not be possible. In this case, the pilot should execute  the appropriate go−around/missed approach procedure  without delay and contact ATC when able to do so.  

As shown in Figure 4-25 , there are many different ways  that the MAP can be depicted, depending on the type  of approach. On all approach charts, it is depicted in the  profile and plan views by the end of the solid course  line and the beginning of the dotted missed approach  course line for the top-line/ lowest published minima. For  a precision approach, the MAP is the point at which the  aircraft reaches the DA or DH while on the glideslope/  glidepath. MAPs on non-precision approaches can be  determined in many different ways. If the primary NAVAID  is on the airport, and either a VOR or NDB approach is  being executed, the MAP is normally the point at which  the aircraft passes the NAVAID.  

On some non-precision approaches, the MAP is given as  a fixed distance with an associated time from the FAF to  the MAP based on the groundspeed of the aircraft. A table  on the lower right or left hand side of the approach chart  shows the distance in NM from the FAF to the MAP and  the time it takes at specific groundspeeds, given in 30  knot increments. Pilots must determine the approximate  groundspeed and time based on the approach speed and  true airspeed of their aircraft and the current winds along  the final approach course. A clock or stopwatch should be  started at the FAF of an approach requiring this method.  Many non-precision approaches designate a specific fix  as the MAP. These can be identified by a course (LOC or  VOR) and DME, a cross radial from a VOR, or an RNAV (GPS)  waypoint.  

Obstacles or terrain in the missed approach segment  may require a steeper climb gradient than the standard  200 ft/NM. If a steeper climb gradient is required, a note  is published on the approach chart plan view with the  penetration description and examples of the required  FPM rate of climb for a given groundspeed (future  charting uses climb gradient). An alternative is normally  charted that allows using the standard climb gradient.  [Figure 4-25] In this example, if the missed approach climb  requirements cannot be met for the Burbank ILS RWY 8  chart, the alternative is to use the LOC RWY 8 that is charted  separately. The LOC RWY 8, S-8 procedure has a MDA that  is 400 feet higher than the ILS RWY 8, S-LOC 8 MDA and  meets the standard climb gradient requirement over the  terrain. For some approaches a new charting standard is  requiring two sets of minimums to be published when  a climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM is required. The  first set of minimums is the lower of the two, requiring a  climb gradient greater than 200 ft/NM. The second set of  minimums is higher, but doesn’t require a climb gradient.  Shown in Figure 4-26, Barstow-Daggett (KDAG) RNAV  (GPS) RWY 26 is an example where there are two LPV lines  of minimums.  

# Example Approach Briefing  

During an instrument approach briefing, the name of the  airport and the specific approach procedure should be  identified to allow other crewmembers the opportunity  to cross-reference the chart being used for the brief. This  ensures that pilots intending to conduct an instrument  approach have collectively reviewed and verified the  information pertinent to the approach. Figure 4-27  gives an example of the items to be briefed and their  sequence. Although the following example is based on  multi-crew aircraft, the process is also applicable to single- pilot operations. A complete instrument approach and  operational briefing example follows.  

The approach briefing begins with a general discussion of  the ATIS information, weather, terrain, NOTAMs, approaches  in use, runway conditions, performance considerations,  expected route to the final approach course, and the  traffic situation. As the discussion progresses, the items  and format of the briefing become more specific. The  briefing can also be used as a checklist to ensure that  all items have been set up correctly. Most pilots verbally  brief the specific MAP so that it is fresh in their minds and  there is no confusion as to who is doing what during a  missed approach. Also, it is a very good idea to brief the  published missed approach even if the tower is most likely  to give you alternate instructions in the event of a missed  approach. A typical approach briefing might sound like  the following example for a flight inbound to the Monroe  Regional Airport (KMLU):  

ATIS:  “Monroe Regional Airport Information Bravo, time  2253 Zulu, wind 360 at 10, visibility 1 mile, mist, ceiling 300  overcast, temperature 4, dew point 3, altimeter 29.73, ILS  Runway 4 approach in use, landing and departing Runway  4, advise on initial contact that you have information Bravo.”  

PF:  “We’re planning an ILS approach to Runway 4 at Monroe  Regional Airport, page 270, effective date 22 Sep 11 to  20 Oct 11. Localizer frequency is 109.5, SABAR Locator  Outer Marker is 392, Monroe VOR is 117.2, final approach  course is 042º. We’ll cross SABAR at 1,483 feet barometric,  decision altitude is 278 feet barometric, touchdown zone  elevation is 78 feet with an airport elevation of 79 feet. MAP  is climb to 2,000 feet, then climbing right turn to 3,000  feet direct Monroe VOR and hold. The MSA is 2,200 feet  to the north and along our missed approach course, and  3,100 feet to the south along the final approach course.  ADF or DME is required for the approach and the airport  has pilot controlled lighting when the tower is closed,  which does not apply to this approach. The runway has a  medium intensity approach lighting system with runway  alignment indicator lights and a precision approach path  indicator (PAPI). We need a half- mile visibility so with one  mile we should be fine. Runway length is 7,507 feet. I’m  planning a flaps 30 approach, auto- brakes 2, left turn on  Alpha or Charlie 1 then Alpha, Golf to the ramp. With a  left crosswind, the runway should be slightly to the right.  I’ll use the autopilot until we break out and, after landing,  I’ll slow the aircraft straight ahead until you say you have  control and I’ll contact ground once we are clear of the  runway. In the case of a missed approach, I’ll press TOGA 

 (Take-off/Go-Around button used on some turbojets), call 

 ‘go-around thrust, flaps 15, positive climb, gear up, set me  up,’ climb straight ahead to 2,000 feet then climbing right  turn to 3,000 feet toward Monroe or we’ll follow the tower’s  instructions. Any questions?”  

PM:  “I’ll back up the auto-speedbrakes. Other than that, I  don’t have any questions.”  

# Instrument Approach Procedure Segments  

An instrument approach may be divided into as many as  four approach segments: initial, intermediate, final, and  missed approach. Additionally, feeder routes provide  a transition from the en route structure to the IAF. FAA  Order 8260.3 criteria provides obstacle clearance for each  segment of an approach procedure as shown in Figure 4-28.  

# Feeder Routes  

By definition, a feeder route is a route depicted on IAP  charts to designate routes for aircraft to proceed from the  en route structure to the IAF. [Figure 4-29 ] Feeder routes,  also referred to as approach transitions, technically are  not considered approach segments but are an integral  part of many IAPs. Although an approach procedure may  have several feeder routes, pilots normally choose the one  closest to the en route arrival point. When the IAF is part of  the en route structure, there may be no need to designate  additional routes for aircraft to proceed to the IAF.  

When a feeder route is designated, the chart provides  the course or bearing to be flown, the distance, and the  minimum altitude. En route airway obstacle clearance  criteria apply to feeder routes, providing 1,000 feet of  obstacle clearance (2,000 feet in mountainous areas).  

# Terminal Routes  

In cases where the IAF is part of the en route structure  and feeder routes are not required, a transition or terminal  route is still needed for aircraft to proceed from the IAF to  the intermediate fix (IF). These routes are initial approach  segments because they begin at the IAF. Like feeder routes,  they are depicted with course, minimum altitude, and  distance to the IF. Essentially, these routes accomplish the  same thing as feeder routes but they originate at an IAF,  whereas feeder routes terminate at an IAF. [Figure 4-30 ]  

# DME Arcs  

DME arcs also provide transitions to the approach course,  but DME arcs are actually approach segments while feeder  routes, by definition, are not. When established on a DME  arc, the aircraft has departed the en route phase and has  begun the approach and is maneuvering to enter an  intermediate or final segment of the approach. DME arcs  may also be used as an intermediate or a final segment,  although they are extremely rare as final approach  segments.  

An arc may join a course at or before the IF. When joining  a course at or before the IF, the angle of intersection of the  arc and the course is designed so it does not exceed   $120^{\circ}$  .  When the angle exceeds  $90^{\circ},$  , a radial that provides at least 2  NM of lead will be identified to assist in leading the turn on  to the intermediate course. DME arcs are predicated on DME  collocated with a facility providing omnidirectional course  information, such as a VOR. A DME arc cannot be based on  an ILS or LOC DME source because omnidirectional course  information is not provided.  

The ROC along the arc depends on the approach segment.  For an initial approach segment, a ROC of 1,000 feet is  required in the primary area, which extends to 4 NM on  either side of the arc. For an intermediate segment primary  area, the ROC is 500 feet. The initial and intermediate  segment secondary areas extend 2 NM from the primary  boundary area edge. The ROC starts at the primary area  boundary edge at 500 feet and tapers to zero feet at the  secondary area outer edge. [Figure 4-31 ]  

# Course Reversal  

Some approach procedures do not permit straight-in  approaches unless pilots are being radar vectored. In these  situations, pilots are required to complete a procedure turn  (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the  PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate  or final approach segment.  

If Category E airplanes are using the PT or there is a descent  gradient problem, the PT distance available can be as much  as 15 NM. During a procedure turn, a maximum speed of  200 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) should be observed  from first crossing the course reversal IAF through the  procedure turn maneuver to ensure containment within  the obstruction clearance area. Unless a holding pattern  or teardrop procedure is published, the point where pilots  begin the turn and the type and rate of turn are optional.  If above the procedure turn minimum altitude, pilots may  A procedure turn is the maneuver prescribed to perform  a course reversal to establish the aircraft inbound on an  intermediate or final approach course. The procedure turn  or hold-in-lieu-of procedure turn is a required maneuver  when it is depicted on the approach chart. However, the  procedure turn or the hold-in-lieu-of PT is not permitted  when the symbol “No PT” is depicted on the initial segment  being flown, when a RADAR VECTOR to the final approach  course is provided, or when conducting a timed approach  from a holding fix.  

The altitude prescribed for the procedure turn is a  minimum altitude until the aircraft is established on the  inbound course. The maneuver must be completed within  the distance specified in the profile view. This distance is  usually 10 miles. This may be reduced to five miles where  only Category A or helicopter aircraft are operated. This  distance may be increased to as much as 15 miles to  accommodate high performance aircraft.  

The pilot may elect to use the procedure turn or hold-in­ lieu-of PT when it is not required by the procedure, but  must first receive an amended clearance from ATC. When  ATC is radar vectoring to the final approach course, or to  the intermediate fix as may occur with RNAV standard  instrument approach procedures, ATC may specify in  the approach clearance “CLEARED STRAIGHT-IN (type)  APPROACH” to ensure that the pilot understands that the  procedure turn or hold-in-lieu-of PT is not to be flown. If  the pilot is uncertain whether ATC intends for a procedure  turn or a straight-in approach to be flown, the pilot will  immediately request clarification from ATC.  

On U.S. Government charts, a barbed arrow indicates the  maneuvering side of the outbound course on which the  procedure turn is made. Headings are provided for course  reversal using the  $45^{\circ}$   type procedure turn. However, the  point at which the turn may be commenced and the type  and rate of turn is left to the discretion of the pilot (limited  by the charted remain within XX NM distance). Some of the  options are the  $45^{\circ}$   procedure turn, the racetrack pattern,  the teardrop procedure turn, or the  $80^{\circ}$   procedure turn, or  the   $80^{\circ}\Longleftrightarrow260^{\circ}$  260° course reversal. Racetrack entries should    be conducted on the maneuvering side where the majority  of protected airspace resides. If an entry places the pilot  on the non-maneuvering side of the PT, correction to  intercept the outbound course ensures remaining within  protected airspace.  

Some procedure turns are specified by procedural track.  These turns must be flown exactly as depicted. These

requirements are necessary to stay within the protected  airspace and maintain adequate obstacle clearance. [Figure  4-32] A minimum of 1,000 feet of obstacle clearance is  provided in the procedure turn primary area. [Figure 4-33]  In the secondary area, 500 feet of obstacle clearance is  provided at the inner edge, tapering uniformly to 0 feet  at the outer edge.  

The primary and secondary areas determine obstacle  clearance in both the entry and maneuvering zones. The  use of entry and maneuvering zones provides further relief  from obstacles. The entry zone is established to control the  obstacle clearance prior to proceeding outbound from the  procedure turn fix. The maneuvering zone is established  to control obstacle clearance after proceeding outbound  from the procedure turn fix.

#  

Descent to the PT completion altitude from the PT fix  altitude (when one has been published or assigned by ATC)  must not begin until crossing over the PT fix or abeam and  proceeding outbound. Some procedures contain a note in  the chart profile view that says “Maintain (altitude) or above  until established outbound for procedure turn.” Newer  procedures simply depict an “at or above” altitude at the PT  fix without a chart note. Both are there to ensure required  obstacle clearance is provided in the procedure turn  entry zone. Absence of a chart note or specified minimum  altitude adjacent to the PT fix is an indication that descent  to the procedure turn altitude can commence immediately  upon crossing over the PT fix, regardless of the direction  of flight. This is because the minimum altitudes in the PT  entry zone and the PT maneuvering zone are the same.  

A holding pattern-in-lieu-of procedure turn may be  specified for course reversal in some procedures. In  such cases, the holding pattern is established over an  intermediate fix or a FAF. The holding pattern distance or  time specified in the profile view must be observed. For a  hold-in-lieu-of PT, the holding pattern direction must be  flown as depicted and the specified leg length/timing must  not be exceeded. Maximum holding airspeed limitations as  set forth for all holding patterns apply. The holding pattern  maneuver is completed when the aircraft is established on  the inbound course after executing the appropriate entry.  If cleared for the approach prior to returning to the holding  fix and the aircraft is at the prescribed altitude, additional  circuits of the holding pattern are not necessary nor  expected by ATC. If pilots elect to make additional circuits  to lose excessive altitude or to become better established  on course, it is their responsibility to so advise ATC upon  receipt of their approach clearance. Refer to the AIM section  5-4-9 for additional information on holding procedures.  

# Initial Approach Segment  

The purposes of the initial approach segment are to provide  a method for aligning the aircraft with the intermediate  or final approach segment and to permit descent during  the alignment. This is accomplished by using a DME arc,  a course reversal, such as a procedure turn or holding  pattern, or by following a terminal route that intersects  the final approach course. The initial approach segment  begins at an IAF and usually ends where it joins the  intermediate approach segment or at an IF. The letters IAF  on an approach chart indicate the location of an IAF and  more than one may be available. Course, distance, and  minimum altitudes are also provided for initial approach  segments. A given procedure may have several initial  approach segments. When more than one exists, each joins  a common intermediate segment, although not necessarily  at the same location.  

Many RNAV approaches make use of a dual-purpose IF/  IAF associated with a hold-in-lieu-of PT (HILO) anchored at  the Intermediate Fix. The HILO forms the Initial Approach  Segment when course reversal is required.  

When the PT is required, it is only necessary to enter the  holding pattern to reverse course. The dual purpose fix  functions as an IAF in that case. Once the aircraft has  entered the hold and is returning to the fix on the inbound  course, the dual-purpose fix becomes an IF, marking the  beginning of the intermediate segment.  

ATC may provide a vector to an IF at an angle of 90 degrees  or less and specify “Cleared Straight-in (type) Approach” .  In those cases, the radar vector is providing the initial  approach segment and the pilot should not fly the PT  without a clearance from ATC.  

Occasionally, a chart may depict an IAF, although there is  no initial approach segment for the procedure. This usually  occurs at a point located within the en route structure  where the intermediate segment begins. In this situation,  the IAF signals the beginning of the intermediate segment.  

# Intermediate Approach Segment  

The intermediate segment is designed primarily to position  the aircraft for the final descent to the airport. Like the feeder  route and initial approach segment, the chart depiction of  the intermediate segment provides course, distance, and  minimum altitude information.  

The intermediate segment, normally aligned within  $30^{\circ}$   of  the final approach course, begins at the IF, or intermediate  point, and ends at the beginning of the final approach  segment. In some cases, an IF is not shown on an approach  chart. In this situation, the intermediate segment begins at  a point where you are proceeding inbound to the FAF, are  properly aligned with the final approach course, and are  located within the prescribed distance prior to the FAF. An  instrument approach that incorporates a procedure turn  is the most common example of an approach that may  not have a charted IF. The intermediate segment in this  example begins when you intercept the inbound course  after completing the procedure turn. [Figure 4-34]  

# Final Approach Segment  

The final approach segment for an approach with vertical  guidance or a precision approach begins where the  glideslope/glidepath intercepts the minimum glideslope/  glidepath intercept altitude shown on the approach  chart. If ATC authorizes a lower intercept altitude, the final  approach segment begins upon glideslope/glidepath  

![](images/f240ee5187bab52f3ab3b7fa46c82e2b257703798c8aa93e0e4bcae4e2a02e17.jpg)  
Figure 4-28.  Approach segments and obstacle clearance.  

interception at that altitude. For a non-precision approach,  the final approach segment begins either at a designated  FAF, which is depicted as a cross on the profile view, or at  the point where the aircraft is established inbound on the  final approach course. When a FAF is not designated, such  as on an approach that incorporates an on-airport VOR  or NDB, this point is typically where the procedure turn  intersects the final approach course inbound. This point  is referred to as the final approach point (FAP). The final  approach segment ends at either the designated MAP or  upon landing.  

There are three types of procedures based on the final  approach course guidance:  

•   Precision approach (PA)—an instrument approach  based on a navigation system that provides course  and glidepath deviation information meeting  precision standards of ICAO Annex 10. For example,  PAR, ILS, and GLS are precision approaches.  •   Approach with vertical guidance (APV) —an  instrument approach based on a navigation system  that is not required to meet the precision approach  standards of ICAO Annex 10, but provides course  and glidepath deviation information. For example,  Baro-VNAV, LDA with glidepath, LNAV/VNAV and LPV  are APV approaches.  •   Non-precision approach (NPA)—an instrument  

approach based on a navigation system that  provides course deviation information but no  glidepath deviation information. For example, VOR,  TACAN, LNAV, NDB, LOC, and ASR approaches are  examples of NPA procedures.  

# Missed Approach Segment  

The missed approach segment begins at the MAP and ends  at a point or fix where an initial or en route segment begins.  The actual location of the MAP depends upon the type of  approach you are flying. For example, during a precision  or an APV approach, the MAP occurs at the DA or DH on  the glideslope/glidepath. For non-precision approaches,  the MAP is either a fix, NAVAID, or after a specified period  of time has elapsed after crossing the FAF.  

# Approach Clearance  

According to FAA Order 7110.65, ATC clearances authorizing  instrument approaches are issued on the basis that if visual  contact with the ground is made before the approach is  completed, the entire approach procedure is followed  unless the pilot receives approval for a contact approach, is  cleared for a visual approach, or cancels the IFR flight plan.  

Approach clearances are issued based on known traffic.  The receipt of an approach clearance does not relieve the  pilot of his or her responsibility to comply with applicable  

![](images/0d7d5982b9a5235f7c5e682fb1a25c579c52f8a8d0417e9d6d6fd9c2cffea1dd.jpg)

parts of the CFRs and notations on instrument approach  charts, which impose on the pilot the responsibility to  comply with or act on an instruction, such as “procedure  not authorized at night.” The name of the approach, as  published, is used to identify the approach. Approach name  items within parentheses are not included in approach  clearance phraseology.  

# Vectors To Final Approach Course  

The approach gate is an imaginary point used within ATC  as a basis for vectoring aircraft to the final approach course.  The gate is established along the final approach course one  mile from the FAF on the side away from the airport and is  no closer than 5 NM from the landing threshold. Controllers  are also required to ensure the assigned altitude conforms  to the following:  

•   For a precision approach, at an altitude not above the glideslope/glidepath or below the minimum glideslope/glidepath intercept altitude specified on the approach procedure chart. •   For a non-precision approach, at an altitude that allows descent in accordance with the published procedure.  

Further, controllers must assign headings that  intercept the final approach course no closer than  the following table:  

A typical vector to the final approach course and associated  approach clearance is as follows:  

“…four miles from LIMAA, turn right heading three four  zero, maintain two thousand until established on the  localizer, cleared ILS runway three six approach.”  

Other clearance formats may be used to fit individual  circumstances, but the controller should always assign an  altitude to maintain until the aircraft is established on a  segment of a published route or IAP. The altitude assigned  must guarantee IFR obstruction clearance from the point at  which the approach clearance is issued until the aircraft is  established on a published route. 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.175  (j) prohibits a pilot from making a procedure turn when vectored to a FAF or course, when conducting a timed approach, or when the procedure specifies “NO PT.”  

When vectoring aircraft to the final approach course,  controllers are required to ensure the intercept is at least  

![](images/c0d072defdf4fe6fb7f9c27b386003ae5e16eb1f789da00c7c410c006eb150e5.jpg)

2 NM outside the approach gate. Exceptions include the  following situations, but do not apply to RNAV aircraft  being vectored for a GPS or RNAV approach:  

•   When the reported ceiling is at least 500 feet above  the MVA/MIA and the visibility is at least 3 SM (may be a pilot report (PIREP) if no weather is reported for  the airport), aircraft may be vectored to intercept the final approach course closer than 2 NM outside the approach gate but no closer than the approach  gate.  

•   If specifically requested by the pilot, aircraft may be vectored to intercept the final approach course inside the approach gate but no closer than the FAF.  

# Nonradar Environment  

In the absence of radar vectors, an instrument approach  begins at an IAF. An aircraft that has been cleared to  a holding fix that, prior to reaching that fix, is issued a  clearance for an approach, but not issued a revised routing,  such as, “proceed direct to…” is expected to proceed via the  last assigned route, a feeder route if one is published on  the approach chart, and then to commence the approach  as published. If, by following the route of flight to the  holding fix, the aircraft would overfly an IAF or the fix  associated with the beginning of a feeder route to be used,  the aircraft is expected to commence the approach using  the published feeder route to the IAF or from the IAF as  appropriate. The aircraft would not be expected to overfly  and return to the IAF or feeder route.  

For aircraft operating on unpublished routes, an altitude  is assigned to maintain until the aircraft is established  on a segment of a published route or IAP. (Example:  “Maintain 2,000 until established on the final approach  course outbound, cleared VOR/DME runway 12.”) The FAA  definition of established on course requires the aircraft  to be established on the route centerline. Generally, the  controller assigns an altitude compatible with glideslope/  glidepath intercept prior to being cleared for the approach.  

# Types of Approaches  

In the NAS, there are approximately 1,105 VOR stations, 916  NDB stations, and 1,194 ILS installations, including 25 LOC- type directional aids (LDAs), 11 simplified directional facilities  (SDFs), and 235 LOC only facilities. As time progresses, it is  the intent of the FAA to reduce navigational dependence on  VOR, NDB, and other ground-based NAVAIDs and, instead,  to increase the use of satellite-based navigation.  

To expedite the use of RNAV procedures for all instrument  pilots, the FAA has begun an aggressive schedule to  develop RNAV procedures. As of 2010, the number of  RNAV/ GPS approaches published in the NAS numbered

10,212 - with additional procedures published every revision  cycle. While it had originally been the plan of the FAA to  begin decommissioning VORs, NDBs, and other ground- based NAVAIDs, the overall strategy has been changed to  incorporate a majority dependence on augmented satellite  navigation while maintaining a satisfactory backup system.  This backup system includes retaining all CAT II and III ILS  facilities and close to one-half of the existing VOR network.  

Each approach is provided obstacle clearance based on the  FAA Order 8260.3 TERPS design criteria as appropriate for  the surrounding terrain, obstacles, and NAVAID availability.  Final approach obstacle clearance is different for every  type of approach but is guaranteed from the start of the  final approach segment to the runway (not below the MDA  for non-precision approaches) or MAP, whichever occurs  last within the final approach area. It is dependent upon  the pilot to maintain an appropriate flight path within  the boundaries of the final approach area and maintain  obstacle clearance.  

There are numerous types of instrument approaches  available for use in the NAS including RNAV (GPS), ILS, MLS,  LOC, VOR, NDB, SDF, and radar approaches. Each approach  has separate and individual design criteria, equipment  requirements, and system capabilities.  

# Visual and Contact Approaches  

To expedite traffic, ATC may clear pilots for a visual  approach in lieu of the published approach procedure if  

![](images/d8e9db1ac4b0f411ea652d99e2cfa75463049d2d196fad76fe4273da1dbbc98c.jpg)  
Figure 4-34.  Approach without a designated IF.  

flight conditions permit. Requesting a contact approach  may be advantageous since it requires less time than  the published IAP and provides separation from IFR and  special visual flight rules (SVFR) traffic. A contact or visual  approach may be used in lieu of conducting a SIAP, and  both allow the flight to continue as an IFR flight to landing  while increasing the efficiency of the arrival.  

# Visual Approaches  

When it is operationally beneficial, ATC may authorize  pilots to conduct a visual approach to the airport in  lieu of the published IAP. A pilot, or the controller,  can initiate a visual approach. Before issuing a visual  approach clearance, ATC must verify that the pilot  has the airport, or a preceding aircraft that they are to  follow, in sight. Once the pilot reports the airport, or  aircraft, in sight, the pilot is responsible to maintain safe  

![](images/654d65a858e80f3c859ca0abcea6c186e5b623dd805accdf9c58b1aaac10b641.jpg)  

altitudes and separation from other aircraft. If the pilot  reports the airport in sight but does not see the aircraft  they are assigned to follow, ATC may still issue the  visual approach clearance but the controller maintains  responsibility for aircraft separation (including wake  turbulence separation). Once pilots report the aircraft  in sight, they assume the responsibilities for their own  separation and wake turbulence avoidance.  

A visual approach is an ATC authorization for an aircraft  on an IFR flight plan to proceed visually to the airport of  intended landing; it is not an IAP. Also, there is no missed  approach segment. An aircraft unable to complete a visual  approach must be handled as any other go-around and  appropriate separation must be provided. A vector for a  visual approach may be initiated by ATC if the reported  ceiling at the airport of intended landing is at least 500 feet  above the MVA/MIA and the visibility is 3 SM or greater. At  airports without weather reporting service, there must be  reasonable assurance through area weather reports and  PIREPs that descent and approach to the airport can be  made visually, and the pilot must be informed that weather  information is not available.  

The visual approach clearance is issued to expedite the flow  of traffic to an airport. It is authorized when the ceiling is  reported or expected to be at least 1,000 feet AGL and the  visibility is at least 3 SM. Pilots must remain clear of the  clouds at all times while conducting a visual approach. At  an airport with a control tower, pilots may be cleared to fly a  visual approach to one runway while others are conducting  VFR or IFR approaches to another parallel, intersecting, or  converging runway. Also, when radar service is provided,  it is automatically terminated when the controller advises  pilots to change to the tower or advisory frequency. While  conducting a visual approach, the pilot is responsible for  providing safe obstacle clearance.  

# Contact Approaches  

If conditions permit, pilots can request a contact approach,  which is then authorized by the controller. A contact  approach cannot be initiated by ATC. This procedure may  be used instead of the published procedure to expedite  arrival, as long as the airport has a SIAP the reported ground  visibility is at least 1 SM, and pilots are able to remain clear  of clouds with at least one statute mile flight visibility  throughout the approach. Some advantages of a contact  approach are that it usually requires less time than the  published instrument procedure, it allows pilots to retain  the IFR clearance, and provides separation from IFR and  SVFR traffic. On the other hand, obstruction clearances and  VFR traffic avoidance becomes the pilot’s responsibility.  Unless otherwise restricted, the pilot may find it necessary  to descend, climb, or fly a circuitous route to the airport to  maintain cloud clearance or terrain/ obstruction clearance.  

The main differences between a visual approach and  a contact approach are: a pilot must request a contact  approach, while a visual approach may be assigned by ATC  or requested by the pilot; and a contact approach may be  

![](images/0593a715f247a0e48764317396f0ad484e10e66b300deb23d11dde2a56e8fed4.jpg)  

approved with one mile visibility if the flight can remain  clear of clouds, while a visual approach requires the pilot  to have the airport in sight, or a preceding aircraft to be  followed, and the ceiling must be at least 1,000 feet AGL  with at least 3 SM visibility.  

# Charted Visual Flight Procedures  

A charted visual flight procedure (CVFP) may be established  at some airports with control towers for environmental or  noise considerations, as well as when necessary for the  safety and efficiency of air traffic operations. Designed  primarily for turbojet aircraft, CVFPs depict prominent  landmarks, courses, and recommended altitudes to specific  runways. When pilots are flying the Roaring Fork Visual  RWY 15, shown in Figure 4-35, mountains, rivers, and towns  provide guidance to Aspen, Colorado’s Sardy Field instead  of VORs, NDBs, and DME fixes.  

Pilots must have a charted visual landmark or a preceding  aircraft in sight, and weather must be at or above the  published minimums before ATC will issue a CVFP  clearance. ATC will clear pilots for a CVFP if the reported  ceiling at the airport of intended landing is at least 500  feet above the MVA/MIA, and the visibility is 3 SM or more,  unless higher minimums are published for the particular  CVFP. When accepting a clearance to follow traffic, the pilot  is responsible for maintaining a safe altitude, approach  interval and wake turbulence separation from other aircraft  Pilots must advise ATC if unable at any point to continue  a charted visual approach or if the pilot loses sight of the  preceding aircraft.  

# RNAV Approaches  

Because of the complications with database coding,  naming conventions were changed in January 2001 to  accommodate all approaches using RNAV equipment into  one classification which is RNAV. This classification includes  both ground- based and satellite dependent systems.  Eventually all approaches that use some type of RNAV will  reflect RNAV in the approach title.  

This changeover is being made to reflect two shifts in  instrument approach technology. The first shift is the  use of the RNP concept outlined in Chapter 1, Departure  Procedures, in which a single performance standard  concept is being implemented for departure/approach  procedure design. Through the use of RNP, the underlying  system of navigation may not be required, provided the  aircraft can maintain the appropriate RNP standard. The  second shift is advanced avionics systems, such as FMS,  used by most airlines, needed a new navigation standard by  which RNAV could be fully integrated into the instrument  approach system.  

An FMS uses multi-sensor navigation inputs to produce  a composite position. Essentially, the FMS navigation  function automatically blends or selects position sensors to  compute aircraft position. Instrument approach charts and  RNAV databases needed to change to reflect these issues.  A complete discussion of airborne navigation databases  is included in Chapter  $^{6,}$   Airborne Navigation Databases.  Due to the multi- faceted nature of RNAV, new approach  criteria have been developed to accommodate the design  of RNAV instrument approaches. This includes criteria for  terminal arrival areas (TAAs), RNAV basic approach criteria,  and specific final approach criteria for different types of  RNAV approaches.  

# Terminal Arrival Areas  

The Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) provides a transition  from the en route structure to the terminal environment  with little required pilot/air traffic control interface for  aircraft equipped with Area Navigation (RNAV) systems.  TAAs provide minimum altitudes with standard obstacle  clearance when operating within the TAA boundaries.  TAAs are primarily used on RNAV approaches but may be  used on an ILS approach when RNAV is the sole means for  navigation to the IF; however, they are not normally used  in areas of heavy concentration of air traffic . [Figure 4-36]  

The basic design of the RNAV procedure underlying the  TAA is normally the “T” design (also called the “Basic T”).  The “T” design incorporates two IAFs plus a dual purpose  IF/IAF that functions as both an intermediate fix and an  initial approach fix. The T configuration continues from the  IF/IAF to the FAF and then to the MAP. The two base leg  IAFs are typically aligned in a straight-line perpendicular to  the intermediate course connecting at the IF/IAF. A Hold- in-Lieu-of Procedure Turn (HILO) is anchored at the IF/IAF  and depicted on U.S. Government publications using the  “hold−in−lieu−of−PT” holding pattern symbol. When the  HILO is necessary for course alignment and/or descent,  the dual purpose IF/IAF serves as an IAF during the entry  into the pattern. Following entry into the HILO pattern  and when flying a route or sector labeled “NoPT,” the dual- purpose fix serves as an IF, marking the beginning of the  Intermediate Segment.  

The standard TAA based on the “T” design consists of  three areas defined by the IAF legs and the intermediate  segment course beginning at the IF/IAF. These areas are  called the straight−in, left−base, and right−base areas.  [Figure 4-36]  TAA area lateral boundaries are identified  by magnetic courses TO the IF/IAF. The straight−in area  can be further divided into pie−shaped sectors with the  boundaries identified by magnetic courses TO the IF/ IAF,  and may contain step-down sections defined by arcs based  on RNAV distances from the IF/IAF.  

Entry from the terminal area onto the procedure is normally  accomplished via a no procedure turn (NoPT) routing or via  a course reversal maneuver. The published procedure will  be annotated “NoPT” to indicate when the course reversal  is not authorized when flying within a particular TAA sector  [Figures 4-36 and 4-37]. Otherwise, the pilot is expected  to execute the course reversal under the provisions of 14  CFR § 91.175. The pilot may elect to use the course reversal  pattern when it is not required by the procedure, but must  receive clearance from air traffic control before beginning  the procedure.  

ATC should not clear an aircraft to the left base leg or right  base leg IAF within a TAA at an intercept angle exceeding 90  degrees. Pilots must not execute the HILO course reversal  when the sector or procedure segment is labeled “NoPT.”  

ATC may clear aircraft direct to the fix labeled IF/IAF if  the course to the IF/IAF is within the straight-in sector  labeled “NoPT” and the intercept angle does not exceed  90 degrees. Pilots are expected to proceed direct to the IF/  IAF and accomplish a straight-in approach. Do not execute  HILO course reversal. Pilots are also expected to fly the  straight−in approach when ATC provides radar vectors and  monitoring to the IF/IAF and issues a“straight-in” approach  clearance; otherwise, the pilot is expected to execute the  HILO course reversal. (See AIM Paragraph 5−4−6, Approach  Clearance)  

On rare occasions, ATC may clear the aircraft for an  approach at the airport without specifying the approach  procedure by name or by a specific approach (e.g., “cleared  RNAV Runway 34 approach”) without specifying a particular  IAF. In either case, the pilot should proceed direct to the IAF  or to the IF/IAF associated with the sector that the aircraft  will enter the TAA and join the approach  course from that  point and if required by that sector (i.e., sector is not labeled  “NoPT), complete the HILO course reversal.  

Note:  If approaching with a TO bearing that is on a sector  boundary, the pilot is expected to proceed in accordance  with a “NoPT” routing unless otherwise instructed by ATC.  

Altitudes published within the TAA replace the MSA alti­ tude. However, unlike MSA altitudes the TAA altitudes are  operationally usable altitudes. These altitudes provide at  least 1,000 feet of obstacle clearance, and more in moun­ tainous areas.  It is important that the pilot knows which  area of the TAA that the aircraft will enter in order to com­ ply with the minimum altitude requirements. The pilot  can determine which area of the TAA the aircraft will enter  by determining the magnetic bearing of the aircraft TO  the fix labeled IF/IAF.  The bearing should then be com­ pared to the published lateral boundary bearings that  define the TAA areas. Do not use magnetic bearing to the  right-base or left-base IAFs to determine position.  

An ATC clearance direct to an IAF or to the IF/IAF with­ out an approach clearance does not authorize a pilot to  descend to a lower TAA altitude. If a pilot desires a low­  

![](images/980a42bbe47267362c13b7c5a477dcf94566c8f77a69cd323dc752867a9c6723.jpg)  

er altitude without an approach clearance, request the  lower TAA altitude from ATC. Pilots not sure of the clear­ ance should confirm their clearance with ATC or request a  specific clearance. Pilots entering the TAA with two−way  radio communications failure (14 CFR § 91.185, IFR Op­ erations: Two−way Radio Communications Failure), must  maintain the highest altitude prescribed by 14 CFR   $\S$  91.185(c)(2) until arriving at the appropriate IAF.  

Once cleared for the approach, pilots may descend in the  TAA sector to the minimum altitude depicted within the  defined area/subdivision, unless instructed otherwise by  air traffic control. Pilots should plan their descent within  the TAA to permit a normal descent from the IF/IAF to the  FAF.  

U.S. Government charts depict TAAs using icons located  in the plan view outside the depiction of the actual ap­ proach procedure.  Use of icons is necessary to avoid ob­ scuring any portion of the “T” procedure (altitudes, cours­ es, minimum altitudes, etc.). The icon for each TAA area  will be located and oriented on the plan view with respect  to the direction of arrival to the approach procedure, and  will show all TAA minimum altitudes and sector/radius  subdivisions. The IAF for each area of the TAA is included  on the icon where it appears on the approach to help the  pilot orient the icon to the approach procedure. The IAF  name and the distance of the TAA area boundary from the  IAF are included on the outside arc of the TAA area icon.  

TAAs may be modified from the standard size and shape  to accommodate operational or ATC requirements. Some  areas may be eliminated, while the other areas are ex­ panded. The “T” design may be modified by the proce­ dure designers where required by terrain or ATC consider­ ations. For instance, the “T” design may appear more like  a regularly or irregularly shaped  $"\Upsilon,$  an upside down   $"\mathsf{L},"$  or an “I.”  

When an airway does not cross the lateral TAA boundar­ ies, a feeder route will be established from an airway fix  or NAVAID to the TAA boundary to provide a transition  from the en route structure to the appropriate IAF. Each  feeder route will terminate at the TAA boundary and will  be aligned along a path pointing to the associated IAF.  Pilots should descend to the TAA altitude after crossing  the TAA boundary and cleared for the approach by ATC.  

Each waypoint on the “T” is assigned a pronounceable  $5-$  letter name, except the missed approach waypoint. These  names are used for ATC communications, RNAV data­ bases, and aeronautical navigation products. The missed  approach waypoint is assigned a pronounceable name  when it is not located at the runway threshold.  

# RNAV Approach Types  

RNAV encompasses a variety of underlying navigation  systems and, therefore, approach criteria. This results in  different sets of criteria for the final approach segment  of various RNAV approaches. RNAV instrument approach  criteria address the following procedures:  

•  GPS overlay of pre-existing nonprecision approaches.  •  VOR/DME based RNAV approaches.  •  Stand-alone RNAV (GPS) approaches.  •  RNAV (GPS) approaches with vertical guidance (APV).  •  RNAV (GPS) precision approaches (WAAS and LAAS).  

# GPS Overlay of Nonprecision Approach  

The original GPS approach procedures provided  authorization to fly non-precision approaches based  on conventional, ground-based NAVAIDs. Many of  these approaches have been converted to stand-alone  approaches, and the few that remain are identified by  the name of the procedure and “or GPS.” These GPS non- precision approaches are predicated upon the design  criteria of the ground-based NAVAID used as the basis of  the approach. As such, they do not adhere to the RNAV  design criteria for stand-alone GPS approaches, and are not  considered part of the RNAV (GPS) approach classification  for determining design criteria. [Figure 4-38]  

# GPS Stand-Alone/RNAV (GPS) Approach  

The number of GPS stand-alone approaches continues to  decrease as they are replaced by RNAV approaches. RNAV  (GPS) approaches are named so that airborne navigation  databases can use either GPS or RNAV as the title of the  approach. This is required for non-GPS approach systems,  such as VOR/DME based RNAV systems. In the past,  these approaches were often referred to as "stand-alone  GPS" approaches. They are considered non-precision  approaches, offering only LNAV and circling minimums.  Precision minimums are not authorized, although LNAV/  VNAV minimums may be published and used as long as  the on-board system is capable of providing approach  approved VNAV. The RNAV (GPS) Runway 14 approach for  Lincoln, Nebraska, incorporates only LNAV and circling  minimums. [Figure 4-39]  

For a non-vertically guided straight-in RNAV (GPS)  approach, the final approach course must be aligned within   $15^{\circ}$   of the extended runway centerline. The final approach  segment should not exceed 10 NM, and when it exceeds 6  NM, a stepdown fix is typically incorporated. A minimum  

![](images/ce9453665dd8b9e3274c43ee1ebe38eebbd48f6e5282ca7851e774d522fd6edf.jpg)  

Figure 4-36.  Terminal arrival area (TAA) design “basic T.”  of 250 feet obstacle clearance is also incorporated into the  final approach segment for straight-in approaches, and a  maximum 400-ft/NM descent gradient is permitted.  The approach design criteria are different for approaches  that use vertical guidance provided by a Baro-VNAV  system. Because the Baro-VNAV guidance is advisory and  not primary, Baro-VNAV approaches are not authorized in  areas of hazardous terrain, nor are they authorized when  

a remote altimeter setting is required. Due to the inherent  problems associated with barometric readings and cold  temperatures, these procedures are also temperature  limited. Additional approach design criteria for RNAV  Approach Construction Criteria can be found in the  appropriate FAA Order 8260-series orders.  

![](images/824750bcf933f7d1109bd9b7c274e31a247d32914aba9eefe1a59dae132f9592.jpg)  

# RNAV (GPS) Approach Using WAAS  

WAAS was commissioned in July 2003, with IOC. Although  precision approach capability is still in the future, WAAS  currently provides a type of APV known as LPV. WAAS  can  support the following minima types: LPV, LNAV/VNAV,  LP, and LNAV. Approach minima as low as 200 feet HAT  and 1/2 SM visibility is possible, even though LPV is not  considered a precision approach. WAAS covers 95 percent  of the country 95 percent of the time.  

Note:  WAAS avionics receive an airworthiness approval  in accordance with Technical Standard Order (TSO)  C145, Airborne Navigation Sensors Using the Global  Positioning System (GPS) Augmented by the Satellite  Based Augmentation System (SBAS), or TSO-146, Stand- Alone Airborne Navigation Equipment Using the Global  Positioning System (GPS) Augmented by the Satellite Based  Augmentation System (SBAS), and installed in accordance  with AC 20-138C, Airworthiness Approval of Positioning  and Navigation Systems.  

Precision approach capability will become available as more  GBAS (LAAS) approach types become operational. GBAS  (LAAS) further increases the accuracy of GPS and improves  signal integrity warnings. Precision approach capability  requires obstruction planes and approach lighting systems  to meet Part 77 standards for ILS approaches. This delays  the implementation of RNAV (GPS) precision approach  capability due to the cost of certifying each runway.  

# ILS Approaches  

Notwithstanding emerging RNAV technology, the ILS is the  most precise and accurate approach NAVAID currently in  use throughout the NAS. An ILS CAT I precision approach  allows approaches to be made to 200 feet above the TDZE  and with visibilities as low as 1,800 RVR; with CAT II and CAT  III approaches allowing descents and visibility minimums  that are even lower. Non-precision approach alternatives  cannot begin to offer the precision or flexibility offered by  an ILS. In order to further increase the approach capacity  of busy airports and exploit the maximum potential of ILS  technology, many different applications are in use.  

An ILS system can accommodate up to 29 arrivals per hour  on a single runway. Two or three parallel runways operating  independently can double or triple the capacity of the  airport. For air commerce, this means greater flexibility  in scheduling passenger and cargo service. Capacity is  increased through the use of simultaneous or converging  ILS approaches, which are explained further in the  corresponding paragraphs below.  

In order to successfully accomplish simultaneous or  converging ILS approaches, flight crews and ATC have  additional responsibilities. When simultaneous instrument  approaches are in use, ATC advises flight crews either  directly or through ATIS of the active runways. It is the  pilot’s responsibility to inform ATC if unable or unwilling  to execute a simultaneous approach. Pilots must comply  with all ATC requests in a timely manner and maintain  strict radio discipline, including using complete aircraft  call signs. It is also incumbent upon the flight crew to  notify ATC immediately of any problems relating to aircraft  communications or navigation systems. At the very least,  the approach procedure briefing should cover the entire  procedure including the approach name, runway number,  frequencies, final approach course, glideslope intercept  altitude, DA or DH, and the missed approach instructions.  The review of autopilot procedures is also appropriate  when making coupled ILS approaches.  

As with all approaches, the primary navigation responsibility  falls upon the pilot in command. ATC instructions will be  limited to ensuring aircraft separation. Additionally, MAPs  are designed to diverge in order to protect all involved  aircraft. ILS approaches of all types are afforded the same  obstacle clearance protection and design criteria, no matter  how capacity is affected by simultaneous ILS approaches.  [Figure 4-40]  

# ILS Approach Categories  

There are three general classifications of ILS approaches:  CAT I, CAT II, and CAT III (autoland). The basic ILS approach is  a CAT I approach and requires only that pilots be instrument  rated and current, and that the aircraft be equipped  appropriately. CAT II and CAT III ILS approaches have lower  minimums and require special certification for operators,  pilots, aircraft, and airborne/ground equipment. Because  of the complexity and high cost of the equipment, CAT III  ILS approaches are used primarily in air carrier and military  operations. [Figure 4-41]  

# CAT II and III Approaches  

The primary authorization and minimum RVRs allowed  for an air carrier to conduct CAT II and III approaches  can be found in OpSpecs Part C. CAT II and III operations  allow authorized pilots to make instrument approaches in  weather that would otherwise be prohibitive.  

While CAT I ILS operations permit substitution of midfield  RVR for TDZ RVR (when TDZ RVR is not available), CAT II ILS  operations do not permit any substitutions for TDZ RVR.  The TDZ RVR system is required and must be used. The TDZ  RVR is controlling for all CAT II ILS operations.  

The weather conditions encountered in CAT III operations  range from an area where visual references are adequate for  manual rollout in CAT IIIa, to an area where visual references  are inadequate even for taxi operations in CAT IIIc. To  date, no U.S. operator has received approval for CAT IIIc  in OpSpecs. Depending on the auto-flight systems, some  aircraft require a DH to ensure that the aircraft is going to  land in the TDZ and some require an Alert Height as a final  cross-check of the performance of the auto-flight systems.  These heights are based on radio altitude (RA) and can be  found in the specific aircraft’s AFM. [Figure 4-42]  

Both CAT II and III approaches require special ground and  airborne equipment to be installed and operational, as  well as special aircrew training and authorization. The  OpSpecs of individual air carriers detail the requirements  of these types of approaches, as well as their performance  criteria. Lists of locations where each operator is approved  to conduct CAT II and III approaches can also be found in  the OpSpecs.  

Special Authorization approaches are designed to  take advantage of advances in flight deck avionics and  technologies like Head-Up Displays (HUD) and automatic  landings. There are extensive ground infrastructures and  lighting requirements for standard CAT II/III, and the  Special Authorization approaches mitigate the lack of some  lighting with the modern avionics found in many aircraft  today. Similar to standard CAT II/III, an air carrier must be  specifically authorized to conduct Special Authorization  CAT I/II in OpSpecs Part C.  

# Simultaneous Approaches To Parallel Runways  

Airports that have two or more parallel runways may be  authorized to use simultaneous parallel approaches to  maximize the capacity of the airport. Depending on the  runway centerline separation and ATC procedures, there are  three classifications of simultaneous parallel approaches:  Simultaneous dependent approaches, simultaneous  independent approaches and simultaneous independent  close parallel approaches. A simultaneous dependent  approach differs from a simultaneous independent  approach in that the minimum distance between parallel  runway centerlines may be less. A staggered separation of  aircraft on the adjacent final approach course is required;  but there is no requirement for a No Transgression Zone  (NTZ) or Final Monitor Controllers. An independent  approach eliminates the need for staggered approaches  and aircraft may be side by side or pass if speeds are  different.  

NOTE:  1. Simultaneous approaches involving an RNAV approach  may only be conducted when (GPS) appears in the  approach title or a chart note states that GPS is required.  See the “ILS Approaches” paragraph above for information  about pilot responsibilities when simultaneous approaches  are in use.  

2. Flight Director or Autopilot requirements for simultaneous  operations will be annotated on the approach chart.  

3. Simultaneous approaches may only be conducted  where instrument approach charts specifically authorize  simultaneous approaches.  

# Simultaneous Dependent Approaches [ Figure  4-46]  

When simultaneous dependent approaches are provided,  ATC applies specific minimum diagonal separation criteria,  depending on the runway separation, between aircraft on  adjacent final approach courses. Aircraft will be staggered  by a minimum of 1 NM diagonally on final, depending  on the distance between runway centerlines. Greater  separation standards are applied when the distance  between runway centerlines is greater. [Figure 4-43]  

At some airports, simultaneous dependent instrument  approaches can be conducted with runways spaced less  than 2,500 feet with specific centerline separations and  threshold staggers. ATC is permitted to apply reduced  diagonal separation and special wake turbulence  procedures. The lead aircraft of the dependent pair is  restricted to being small or large aircraft weight type and is  cleared to the lower approach.  The design of the approach,  aircraft weight type, and lateral separation between the two  approaches provide necessary wake turbulence avoidance  for this type of operation. An example of approach design  to help avoid wake turbulence is that some locations use  different glide slope angles on adjacent approaches; also,  if applicable, staggered thresholds help. An ATIS example  is: “Simultaneous ILS Runway 28 Left and ILS Runway 28  Right in use.” For further information, see FAA Orders JO  7110.65 and JO 7110.308.  

Where a simultaneous approach operation is approved,  sometimes each approach chart indicates the other  runway(s) with which simultaneous approaches can be  conducted.  For example, “Simultaneous approaches  authorized with runway 12L” . As procedures are revised,  the chart note will be modified to indicate “Simultaneous  approach authorized” but will not list the other runways or  approach types as that detailed information will normally  be transmitted in the ATIS or by ATC. For example, pilots  flying into Sacramento, California, may encounter parallel  approach procedures. [Figure 4-44] When there is no  chart note stating, “Simultaneous approaches authorized” standard separation is used between aircraft on parallel  approaches.  

# Simultaneous Independent Approaches  

Dual and triple simultaneous independent parallel  instrument approaches, are authorized at certain airports  with specified distances between parallel runway centerlines.  As a part of the simultaneous independent approach  approval, an NTZ must be established to ensure proper flight  track boundaries for all aircraft. Outside of the NTZ, normal  operating zones (NOZ) indicate the operating zone within  which aircraft remain during normal approach operations.  The NOZ between the final approach courses varies in  width depending on the runway centerline spacing. The  NTZ is defined as a 2,000-foot wide area located equidistant  between the final approach courses in which flight is not  allowed during the simultaneous operation. [Figure 4-46]  Any time an aircraft breaches or is anticipated to breach the  NTZ, ATC issues instructions for the threatened aircraft on the  adjacent final approach course to break off the approach to  avoid potential conflict.  

A local controller for each runway is also required.  Dedicated  final monitor controllers for each runway monitor separation,  track aircraft positions and issue instructions to pilots of  aircraft observed deviating from the final approach course.  [Figure 4-45] These operations are normally authorized  for ILS, LDA and RNAV approach procedures with vertical  guidance. For simultaneous parallel ILS approach operations,  pilots should review the chart notes to determine whether  the non-precision LOC procedure is authorized (in the  event of glide slope equipment failure either in the aircraft  or the ground). An example of a restriction on the use of a  LOC procedure is shown in the notes on Figure 4-24:  “LOC  procedure NA during simultaneous operations” . Likewise, for  RNAV (GPS) approaches, use of LNAV procedures are often  restricted during simultaneous operations.  

Triple simultaneous independent approaches are authorized  provided the runway centerlines are separated by at least  3900 feet for triple straight in approaches. If one or both  outside runways have an offset approach course of   $2.5^{\circ}$  to   $3.0^{\circ},$  , the spacing between those outer runways and the  center runway may be reduced to 3000 feet.  

# Simultaneous Close Parallel Precision Runway  Monitor (PRM) Approaches  

Simultaneous close parallel (independent) PRM approaches  are authorized for use at  designated airports that have  parallel runways spaced less than 4,300 feet apart.  [Figure 4-47] Certain PRM approaches are referred to as  Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches (SOIA) and  are discussed in depth later in this chapter.  

PRM procedures are the most efficient method of increasing  approach capacity at airports with closely spaced, parallel  runways. Use of PRM procedures increases airport  capacity during periods of low visibility by providing  ATC the capability to monitor simultaneous close parallel  (independent) approaches. These PRM operations reduce  delays and increase fuel savings. Traditionally the PRM  system included a high-update rate radar, a high resolution  ATC radar display, as well as software that can autonomously  track aircraft in close to real time, with visual and aural alerts  that depict the aircraft’s current position and velocity as  well as displaying a ten-second projected position to the  controllers.  Today, most PRM operations are conducted  without the need for high update rate radar, so long as all  of the other requirements to conduct such approaches  are met.  

There are also special communications and ATC  requirements for PRM approaches.  PRM approaches  require a final NTZ monitor controller for each runway, a  separate tower controller for each runway, a PRM tower  frequency, and a runway-specific PRM frequency.  Each final  monitor controller will have a dedicated PRM frequency,  and the tower controller will have a separate common PRM  frequency.  Pilots transmit and receive on the common  tower PRM frequency, but maintain listening watch on the  final controller’s PRM frequency for their specified runway.  The final monitor controller has override capability on  their PRM frequency. In that way, if the common tower  frequency is blocked, the monitor controller’s instructions  will be heard by the pilot on the monitor controller’s PRM  frequency.  Pilot training is prescribed and required for  pilots prior to using the PRM procedures. The FAA PRM  website (http://www.faa.gov/training testing/ training/  prm/) contains training information for PRM approaches  and hosts PRM training materials for download or viewing  online.”  

When pilots or flight crews wish to decline a PRM approach,  ATC must be notified immediately and the flight will be  transitioned into the area at the convenience of ATC. Pilots    who are unable to accept a PRM approach may be subject  to delays.  

The approach chart for the PRM approach requires review of  the accompanying AAUP page, which outlines pilot, aircraft,  and procedure requirements necessary to participate in  PRM operations. [Figure 4-48] Pilots need to be aware  of the differences associated with this type of approach.  Differences, as compared to other simultaneous approaches,  are listed below:  

•   Immediately follow break out instructions as soon  

# as safety permits.  

#   Use of the AAUP.  

•   Use of dual VHF communications.  

•   Completion of required PRM training. •   Handflying any breakout instruction. It is important  to note that descending breakouts, though rare, may  be issued. Flight crews will never be issued breakout  instructions that clear them to an altitude below the  MVA, and they are not required to descend at more  than 1,000 fpm. •   Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) is  not required to conduct a PRM approach. For aircraft  so equipped, if the controller’s climb/descend   instruction differs from the TCAS resolution advisory  (RA), pilots must follow the RA while continuing to follow the controller’s turn instruction.  Report this deviation to ATC as soon as practical.  

# Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches  (SOIAs)  

SOIAs allow simultaneous approaches to two parallel  runways spaced at least 750 feet apart, but less than 3,000  feet. Traditionally, the SOIA procedure has used an ILS/  PRM approach to one runway and an offset localizer-type  directional aid (LDA)/PRM approach with glideslope to  the adjacent runway. Now, RNAV (GPS) and RNAV (RNP)  approaches may also be used for SOIA.” Approach charts  will include procedural notes, such as “Simultaneous Close  Parallel approach authorized with LDA PRM RWY 28R and  RNAV (GPS) PRM X RWY 28R.” or “Simultaneous approach  authorized” . San Francisco had  the first published SOIA  approach. [Figure 4-49]  

The training, procedures, and system requirements for  SOIA ILS/PRM and LDA/PRM approaches are identical  with those used for simultaneous close parallel ILS/PRM  approaches until near the LDA/PRM approach MAP, where  visual acquisition of the ILS aircraft by the LDA aircraft must  be accomplished. If visual acquisition is not accomplished  prior to reaching the LDA MAP , a missed approach must  be executed. A visual segment for the LDA/PRM approach  is established between the LDA MAP and the runway  threshold. Aircraft transition in visual conditions from  the LDA course, beginning at the LDA MAP, to align with  the runway and can be stabilized by 500 feet AGL on the  extended runway centerline.  Pilots are reminded that they  are responsible for collision avoidance and wake turbulence  mitigation between the LDA MAP and the runway.  

The FAA website has additional information about PRM and  SOIA approaches, including an instructional PowerPoint  training presentation at http://www.faa.gov/training_  testing/training/prm/.  

# Converging ILS Approaches  

Another method by which ILS approach capacity can be  increased is through the use of converging approaches.  Converging approaches may be established at airports  that have runways with an angle between   $15^{\circ}$   and   $100^{\circ}$  and each runway must have an ILS. Additionally, separate  procedures must be established for each approach, and  each approach must have a MAP at least 3 NM apart with  no overlapping of the protected missed approach airspace.  Only straight-in approaches are approved for converging  ILS procedures. If the runways intersect, the controller must  be able to visually separate intersecting runway traffic.  

Approaches to intersecting runways generally have higher  minimums, commonly with 600-foot ceiling and 1 1/4 to 2  mile visibility requirements. Pilots are informed of the use  of converging ILS approaches by the controller upon initial  contact or through ATIS. [Figure 4-50]  

Dallas/Fort Worth International airport is one of the few  airports that makes use of converging ILS approaches  because its runway configuration has multiple parallel  runways and two offset runways. [Figure 4-51] The  approach chart title indicates the use of converging  approaches and the notes section highlights other runways  that are authorized for converging approach procedures.  Note the slight different in charting titles on the IAPs. Soon  all Converging ILS procedures will be charted in the newer  format shown in Figure 4-50, with the use of "V" in the title,  and "CONVERGING" in parenthesis.  

# VOR Approach  

The VOR is one of the most widely used non-precision  approach types in the NAS. VOR approaches use VOR  facilities both on and off the airport to establish approaches  and include the use of a wide variety of equipment, such  as DME and TACAN. Due to the wide variety of options  included in a VOR approach, TERPS outlines design criteria  for both on and off airport VOR facilities, as well as VOR  approaches with and without a FAF. Despite the various  configurations, all VOR approaches are non-precision  approaches, require the presence of properly operating  VOR equipment, and can provide MDAs as low as 250 feet  above the runway. VOR also offers a flexible advantage in  that an approach can be made toward or away from the  navigational facility.  

The VOR approach into Fort Rucker, Alabama, is an example  of a VOR approach where the VOR facility is on the airport  and there is no specified FAF. [Figure 4-52] For a straight-in  

![](images/8d256e0c410fa4cb232073a279088c7c752ee834364347ab14fe78840ba654de.jpg)  

![](images/92a5d58834593ee4be2423896f9922592c7937e4eafa2e1854202effaa82d70f.jpg)  

approach, the final approach course is typically aligned  to intersect the extended runway centerline 3,000 feet  from the runway threshold, and the angle of convergence  between the two does not exceed   $30^{\circ}$  . This type of VOR  approach also includes a minimum of 300 feet of obstacle  clearance in the final approach area. The final approach  area criteria include a 2 NM wide primary area at the facility  that expands to 6 NM wide at a distance of 10 NM from  the facility. Additional approach criteria are established  for courses that require a high altitude teardrop approach  penetration.  

When DME is included in the title of the VOR approach,  operable DME must be installed in the aircraft in order to  fly the approach from the FAF. The use of DME allows for an  accurate determination of position without timing, which  greatly increases situational awareness throughout the  approach. Alexandria, Louisiana, is an excellent example  of a VOR/DME approach in which the VOR is off the airport  and a FAF is depicted. [Figure 4-53] In this case, the final  approach course is a radial or straight-in final approach and  is designed to intersect the runway centerline at the runway  threshold with the angle of convergence not exceeding  $30^{\circ}$  .  

The criteria for an arc final approach segment associated  with a VOR/DME approach is based on the arc being  beyond 7 NM and no farther than 30 NM from the VOR  and depends on the angle of convergence between the  runway centerline and the tangent of the arc. Obstacle  clearance in the primary area, which is considered the area  4 NM on either side of the arc centerline, is guaranteed by  at least 500 feet.  

# NDB Approach  

Like the VOR approach, an NDB approach can be designed  using facilities both on and off the airport, with or without  a FAF, and with or without DME availability. At one time,  it was commonplace for an instrument student to learn  how to fly an NDB approach, but with the growing use of  GPS, many pilots no longer use the NDB for instrument  approaches. New RNAV approaches are also rapidly being  constructed into airports that are served only by NDB. The  long-term plan includes the gradual phase out of NDB  facilities, and eventually, the NDB approach becomes  nonexistent. Until that time, the NDB provides additional  availability for instrument pilots into many smaller, remotely  located airports.  

The NDB Runway 35 approach at Carthage/Panola County  Sharpe Field is an example of an NDB approach established  with an on-airport NDB that does not incorporate a FAF.  [Figure 4-54] In this case, a procedure turn or penetration  turn is required to be a part of the approach design. For  the NDB to be considered an on-airport facility, the facility  must be located within one mile of any portion of the  landing runway for straight-in approaches and within one  mile of any portion of usable landing surface for circling  approaches. The final approach segment of the approach  is designed with a final approach area that is 2.5 NM wide  at the facility and increases to 8 NM wide at 10 NM from  the facility. Additionally, the final approach course and  the extended runway centerline angle of convergence  cannot exceed  $30^{\circ}$   for straight-in approaches. This type of  NDB approach is afforded a minimum of 350 feet obstacle  clearance.  

When a FAF is established for an NDB approach, the  approach design criteria changes. It also takes into account  whether or not the NDB is located on or off the airport.  Additionally, this type of approach can be made both  moving toward or away from the NDB facility. The Tuscon  Ryan Field, NDB/DME RWY 6 is an approach with a FAF  using an on-airport NDB facility that also incorporates the  use of DME. [Figure 4-55] In this case, the NDB has DME  capabilities from the LOC approach system installed on the  airport. While the alignment criteria and obstacle clearance  remain the same as an NDB approach without a FAF, the  final approach segment area criteria changes to an area that  is 2.5 NM wide at the facility and increases to 5 NM wide,  15 NM from the NDB.  

# Radar Approaches  

The two types of radar approaches available to pilots when  operating in the NAS are precision approach radar (PAR) and  airport surveillance radar (ASR). Radar approaches may be  given to any aircraft at the pilot’s request. ATC may also offer  radar approach options to aircraft in distress regardless of  the weather conditions or as necessary to expedite traffic.  Despite the control exercised by ATC in a radar approach  environment, it remains the pilot’s responsibility to ensure  the approach and landing minimums listed for the approach  are appropriate for the existing weather conditions  considering personal approach criteria certification and  company OpSpecs.  

Perhaps the greatest benefit of either type of radar approach  is the ability to use radar to execute a no gyro approach.  Assuming standard rate turns, ATC can indicate when to  begin and end turns. If available, pilots should make use of  this approach when the heading indicator has failed and  partial panel instrument flying is required.  

Information about radar approaches is published in tabular  form in the front of the TPP booklet. PAR, ASR, and circling  approach information including runway, DA, DH, or MDA,  height above airport (HAA), HAT, ceiling, and visibility criteria

![](images/a04e89c77f2c1865dfb66b55be9b6bebf7a0a977833999b7444a55e7846c32b6.jpg)  

Regardless of the type of radar approach in use, ATC  monitors aircraft position and issues specific heading  and altitude information throughout the entire approach.  Particularly, lost communications procedures should  be briefed prior to execution to ensure pilots have a  comprehensive understanding of ATC expectations if radio  communication were lost. ATC also provides additional  information concerning weather and missed approach  instructions when beginning a radar approach. [Figure  4-56]  

# Precision Approach Radar (PAR)  

PAR provides both vertical and lateral guidance, as well as  range, much like an ILS, making it the most precise radar  approach available. The radar approach, however, is not  able to provide visual approach indications in the flight  deck. This requires the flight crew to listen and comply  with controller instructions. PAR approaches are rare, with  most of the approaches used in a military setting; any  opportunity to practice this type of approach is beneficial  to any flight crew.  

The final approach course of a PAR approach is normally  aligned with the runway centerline, and the associated  glideslope is typically no less than  $2.5^{\circ}$   and no more than   $3^{\circ}$  . Obstacle clearance for the final approach area is based  on the particular established glideslope angle and the  exact formula is outlined in FAA Order 8260.3. [Figure 4-57]  

# Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR)  

ASR approaches are typically only approved when  necessitated for an ATC  operational requirement or in an  unusual or emergency situation. This type of radar only  provides heading and range information, although the  controller can advise the pilot of the altitude where the  aircraft should be based on the distance from the runway.  An ASR approach procedure can be established at any radar

facility that has an antenna within 20 NM of the airport  and meets the equipment requirements outlined in FAA  Order 8200.1, U.S. Standard Flight Inspection Manual. ASR  approaches are not authorized for use when Center Radar  ARTS processing (CENRAP) procedures are in use due to  diminished radar capability.  

The final approach course for an ASR approach is aligned  with the runway centerline for straight-in approaches  and aligned with the center of the airport for circling  approaches. Within the final approach area, the pilot is also  guaranteed a minimum of 250 feet obstacle clearance. ASR  descent gradients are designed to be relatively flat, with an  optimal gradient of 150 feet per mile and never exceeding  300 feet per mile.  

# Localizer Approaches  

As an approach system, the localizer is an extremely flexible  approach aid that, due to its inherent design, provides  many applications for a variety of needs in instrument  flying. An ILS glideslope installation may be impossible  due to surrounding terrain. The localizer is able to provide  four separate types of non-precision approaches from one  approach system:  

•   Localizer approach •   Localizer/DME approach •   Localizer back course approach •   Localizer-type directional aid (LDA)  

# Localizer and Localizer DME  

The localizer approach system can provide both precision  and non-precision approach capabilities to a pilot. As a  part of the ILS system, the localizer provides horizontal  guidance for a precision approach. Typically, when the  localizer is  discussed, it is thought of as a non-precision  approach due to the fact that either it is the only approach  system installed, or the glideslope is out of service on the  ILS. In either case, the localizer provides a non-precision  approach using a localizer transmitter installed at a specific  airport. [Figure 4-58]  

TERPS provides the same alignment criteria for a localizer  approach as it does for the ILS, since it is essentially the  

![](images/512941a4db2b638813dd1f2ef3c93519793832f9fd0a63f7196bee85caf3fb7c.jpg)

same approach without vertical guidance stemming from  the glideslope. A localizer is always aligned within  $3^{\circ}$   of the  runway, and it is afforded a minimum of 250 feet obstacle  clearance in the final approach area. In the case of a  localizer DME (LOC DME) approach, the localizer installation  has a collocated DME installation that provides distance  information required for the approach. [Figure 4-59]  

# Localizer Back Course  

In cases where an ILS is installed, a back course may be  available in conjunction with the localizer. Like the localizer,  the back course does not offer a glideslope, but remember  that the back course can project a false glideslope signal  and the glideslope should be ignored. Reverse sensing  occurs on the back course using standard VOR equipment.  

With a horizontal situation indicator (HSI) system, reverse  sensing is eliminated if it is set appropriately to the front  course. [Figure 4-60]  

# Localizer-Type Directional Aid (LDA)  

The LDA is of comparable use and accuracy to a localizer  but is not part of a complete ILS. The LDA course usually  provides a more precise approach course than the similar  simplified directional facility (SDF) installation, which may  have a course width of  $6^{\circ}$   or   $12^{\circ}$  .  

The LDA is not aligned with the runway. Straight-in  minimums may be published where alignment does  not exceed   $30^{\circ}$   between the course and runway. Circling  minimums only are published where this alignment  exceeds  $30^{\circ}$  .  

![](images/f4eded5317dd37120dd17c26397ba906a00822dd3f658e2b2950e5d8490013f7.jpg)  

A very limited number of LDA approaches also incorporate  a glideslope. These are annotated in the plan view of the  instrument approach chart with a note, “LDA/Glideslope.”  These procedures fall under a newly defined category of  approaches called Approach (Procedure) with Vertical  Guidance (aviation) APVs. LDA minima for with and without  glideslope is provided and annotated on the minima lines  of the approach chart as S−LDA/GS and S−LDA. Because  the final approach course is not aligned with the runway  centerline, additional maneuvering is required compared  to an ILS approach. [Figure 4-61]  

# Simplified Directional Facility (SDF)  

The SDF provides a final approach course similar to that of  the ILS localizer. It does not provide glideslope information.  A clear understanding of the ILS localizer and the additional  factors listed below completely describe the operational  characteristics and use of the SDF. [Figure 4-62]  

The approach techniques and procedures used in an SDF  instrument approach are essentially the same as those  employed in executing a standard localizer approach  except the SDF course may not be aligned with the runway  and the course may be wider, resulting in less precision.  Like the LOC type approaches, the SDF is an alternative  approach that may be installed at an airport for a variety  of reasons, including terrain. The final approach is provided  a minimum of 250 feet obstacle clearance for straight-in  approaches while in the final approach area, which is an  area defined for a   $6^{\circ}$   course: 1,000 feet at or abeam the  runway threshold expanding to 19,228 feet (10 NM) from  the threshold. The same final approach area for a 12°  course is larger. This type of approach is also designed with  a maximum descent gradient of 400 feet per NM, unless  circling only minimums are authorized.

# Chapter 5    Improvement Plans  

Introduction  

In the upcoming years, exciting new technologies will  be developed and implemented to help ease air traffic  congestion, add to system capacity, and enhance safety.  Some of these seamless changes will be invisible to  pilots. Others will entail learning new procedures, aircraft  equipment, and systems that will introduce powerful new  capabilities and dramatically increase the safety of all flight  operations.  

# Next Generation Air Transportation (NextGen)  System  

Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is a  comprehensive overhaul of the National Airspace System  (NAS) designed to make air travel more convenient and  dependable, while ensuring flights are as safe and secure  as possible. It moves away from ground-based surveillance  and navigation to new and more dynamic satellite-based  systems and procedures, and introduces new technological  innovations in areas such as weather forecast, digital  communications, and networking. [Figure 5-1] When fully  implemented, NextGen will safely allow aircraft to fly more  closely together on more direct routes, reducing delays,  and providing unprecedented benefits for the environment  and the economy through reductions in carbon emissions,  fuel consumption, and noise. [Figure 5-2]  

Implementation in stages across the United States is due  between 2012 and 2025. In order to implement NextGen,  the FAA will undertake a wide-range transformation of the  entire United States air transportation system. NextGen  consists of the following five systems:  

1. 	 Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast  (ADS-B)—automatically broadcasts the aircraft’s  position and other aircraft specific information to  air traffic control (ATC) ground facilities and nearby  aircraft equipped with ADS-B In. Effective January  1, 2020 all aircraft operating in certain controlled  U.S. airspace will be required to operate ADS-B Out  equipment at all times. While Global Navigation  Satellite System (GNSS) is not mandated by rule  as the position sensor, it is currently the only  position source that meets the rule’s performance  requirements.  Aircraft broadcasting ADS-B Out data  provide ATC and cooperating ADS-B-In aircraft more  precise on-the- ground or in-the-air positioning  information based on the increased frequency of the  data broadcasts and the accuracy of GNSS. ADS-B  will provide a complete picture of air traffic for ATC  and pilots of ADS-B In-equipped aircraft. The FAA’s

ADS-B ground infrastructure is complete and ATC  now uses ADS-B for aircraft tracking both in the air  and on the ground at many airports.  

2.  System wide information management (SWIM)—  will provide a single infrastructure and information  management system to deliver high quality, timely  data to many users and applications. By reducing  the number and types of interfaces and systems,  SWIM will reduce data redundancy and better  facilitate multi- user information sharing. SWIM  will also enable new modes of decision-making as  information is more easily accessed. [Figure 5-4]  

3.  Next generation data communications—current  communications between aircrew and ATC, and  between air traffic controllers, are largely realized  through voice communications. Initially, the  introduction of data communications will provide  an additional means of two-way communication  for ATC clearances, instructions, advisories, flight  crew requests, and reports. With the majority of  aircraft data link equipped, the exchange of routine  controller-pilot messages and clearances via data  link will enable controllers to handle more traffic.  This will improve ATC productivity, enhancing  capacity and safety. [Figure 5-5]  

4.  Next generation network enabled weather  (NNEW)— seventy percent of NAS delays are  attributed to weather every year. The goal of NNEW  is to cut weather-related delays at least in half. Tens  of thousands of global weather observations and  sensor reports from ground, airborne, and space- based sources will fuse into a single national weather  information system updated in real time. NNEW  will provide a common weather picture across the  NAS and enable better air transportation decision- making. [Figure 5-6]  

5.  NAS voice switch (NVS)—there are currently  seventeen different voice switching systems in the  NAS; some in use for more than twenty years. NVS  will replace these systems with a single air/ground

# NextGen Existing Improvements  

The goal of NextGen is to provide new capabilities that  make air transportation safer and more reliable while  improving the capacity of the NAS and reducing aviation’s  impact on the environment. Below is a list of some of the  capabilities for operational use that have already been  implemented through NextGen.  

1.    Starting in December 2009, the FAA began   controlling air traffic over the Gulf of Mexico, an   area of active airspace where surveillance was   never before possible, using the satellite-based   technology of ADS-B. For aircraft flying over the   Gulf of Mexico, where no radar coverage is available,  ATC can safely and more efficiently separate air   traffic with the real-time visual representation of air  traffic provided by ADS-B. It also provides pilots with  

![](images/bff206f9f8b0a4588e7dfaacd095dfc4bc5db3fa504c08c1c7896652bc147baa.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.  ADS-B services provide real-time precise positioning capability to ATC and ADS-B In-equipped aircraft throughout the  NAS, in all phases of flight operations.

Figure 5-9.  Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  

more safety benefits such as improved situational  awareness (SA), near real-time weather information,  and additional voice communications.  

2.   ADS-B services have been deployed to all 24 modernized enroute ARTCCs and the largest terminal radar approach control facilities in the NAS.  In 2020, ADS-B will be mandatory for all aircraft in almost all NAS controlled airspace. [Figure 5-8]  

3.   Satellite-based technologies, including the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), are improving access to runways at both large and small airports. [Figure 5-9] Directions and maps have been published  for more than 500 precision-like approaches enabled by WAAS. Localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) procedures improves access to airports in lower visibility conditions and where obstacles are present. These procedures are particularly valuable for smaller airports used by general aviation. There are now oer 2,300 LPV procedures available at runways where no instrument landing system (ILS) is present.  

4.   The Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) has  been approved for Category I operations and the first satellite-based system has been approved for this category of precision approach which enables instrument-based operations down to 200 feet above the surface even during reduced visibility. [Figure 5-10] GBAS was installed at Houston, Texas and Newark, New Jersey airport in 2009.  

5.   Multilateration, a ground-based surveillance technology, is being implemented to help improve runway access. The FAA installed and is now using wide area multilateration (WAM) systems to control air traffic in Juneau, Alaska, and at four airports in Colorado. This allows air traffic to be safely separated  by five miles whereas before each aircraft had to clear  the airspace around the airport before the next could  enter.  

6.   New runways at Chicago O’Hare, Washington Dulles, and Seattle-Tacoma Airports opened in November of 2008, which are now beginning to have a reduction in delays.  

![](images/e364d641914d8886f349b29033d92ea7c189d5f5c74a8c3eff55a85485fa408d.jpg)

# Benefits of NextGen  

The implementation of NextGen will allow pilots and  dispatchers to select their own direct flightpaths, rather  than follow the existing Victor, Jet, and LF/MF airways.  Each aircraft will transmit and receive precise information  about the time at which it and others will cross key  points along their paths. Pilots and air traffic managers  on the ground will have the same precise information  transmitted via data communications.  

Major demand and capacity imbalances will be worked  collaboratively between FAA air traffic managers and  flight operations. The increased scope, volume, and  widespread distribution of information by SWIM will  improve decision- making and let more civil aviation  authorities participate. The impact of weather on flight  operations will be reduced through the use of improved  information sharing, new technology to sense and  

![](images/45ee5ffd5967045e816c419a58e84e124e78f4742d9c4806665677c971738d3a.jpg)  
Figure 5-11.  NextGen improves airport surface movements, reduces  spacing and separation requirements, and better manages the  overall flows into and out of busy airports.  

mitigate the impacts of the weather, and to improve  weather forecasts and decision-making. Better forecasts,  coupled with greater automation, will minimize airspace  limitations and traffic restrictions.  

The new procedures of NextGen will improve airport  surface movements, reduce spacing and separation  requirements, and better manage the overall flows into  and out of busy airspace, as well as provide maximum use  of busy airports. [Figure 5-11] Targeting NextGen at the  whole of the NAS, rather than just the busiest airports,  will uncover untapped capacity across the whole system.  During busy traffic periods, NextGen will rely on aircraft to  fly precise routes into and out of many airports to increase  throughput.

# Head-Up Displays (HUD)  

As aircraft became more sophisticated and electronic  instrument landing systems (ILS) were developed in the  1930s and 1940s, it was necessary while landing in poor  weather for one pilot to monitor the instruments to keep  the aircraft aligned with radio beams while the second pilot  divided time between monitoring the instruments and  the outside environment. The pilot monitoring reported  the runway environment in sight and the flying pilot  completed the approach visually.  This is still the standard  practice used for passenger carrying aircraft in commercial  service while making ILS landings. As single-piloted aircraft  became more complex, it became very difficult for pilots  to focus on flying the aircraft while also monitoring a large  number of navigation, flight, and systems instruments. To  overcome this problem, the head-up display (HUD) was  

![](images/24781445fc7aa3dd83792ea3f81b4c5200242f8f3e9ec9eb506715087be7fd9c.jpg)

developed. By showing airspeed, altitude, heading, and  aircraft attitude on the HUD glass, pilots were able to keep  their eyes outside of the flight deck rather than have to  continuously scan from outside to inside to view the flight  instruments. [Figure 5-12] Collimators make the image on  the glass appear to be far out in front of the aircraft so that  the pilot need not change eye focus to view the relatively  nearby HUD. Today’s head-up guidance systems (HGS)  use holographic displays. [Figure 5-13] Everything from  weapons status to approach information can be shown  on current military and civilian HGS displays.

# Synthetic and Enhanced Vision Systems  Synthetic Vision System (SVS)  

A synthetic vision system (SVS) is an electronic means  to display a synthetic vision image of the external scene  topography to the flight crew. [Figure 5-14] It is not a  real-time image like that produced by an enhanced flight  vision system (EFVS). Unlike EFVS, SVS requires a terrain  and obstacle database, a precise navigation solution, and  a display. The terrain image is based on the use of data  from a digital elevation model (DEM) that is stored within  the SVS. With SVS, the synthetic terrain/vision image is  intended to enhance pilot awareness of spatial position  relative to important features in all visibility conditions.  This is particularly useful during critical phases of flight,  such as takeoff, approach, and landing where important  features such as terrain, obstacles, runways, and landmarks  may be depicted on the SVS display. [Figure 5-15] During  approach operations, the obvious advantages of SVS are  that the digital terrain image remains on the pilot’s display  regardless of how poor the visibility is outside. An SVS  image can be displayed on either a head-down display or  head-up display (HUD).  Development efforts are currently  underway that would combine SVS with a real-time sensor  image produced by an EFVS. These systems will be known  as Combined Vision Systems (CVS).  

# Synthetic Vision Guidance System (SVGS)  

SVGS is a combination of flight guidance display technology  and high precision position assurance monitors.  The SVGS  flight instrument display provides a continuous, geo-  

![](images/01c8d983b376979a2d1a9037197aa84eda9971fb3027285c10ddcb6eea40204f.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.  Enhanced and synthetic vision displayed on primary  flight displays.  

spatially correct, database driven, computer-generated  synthetic depiction of the nearby topography, including  obstacles, and a display of the landing runway. The SVGS  display may be implemented on a head down Primary Flight  Display, and/or a Head-Up Display (HUD). SVGS includes  additional symbology, integrity and performance monitors  and annunciations that enable low visibility operations.  These additional monitors assure an accurate depiction of  the external scene. An SVGS differs from an EFVS in that it  does not produce a real-time image of the external scene.  SVGS may not be used in lieu of natural vision. SVGS is  intended to be used to increase situational awareness  on the straight-in final approach segment of published  instrument approaches and requires Special Authorization.  

# Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS)  

For an in-depth discussion regarding Enhanced Flight  Vision Systems, see Chapter 4 of this handbook as well as  AC 90-106 (current version).

# Combined Vision System Technology  

The FAA’s NextGen program will transform the NAS to  accommodate a projected three-fold increase in air  operations in the coming decade. Technological and  systemic changes are being developed to significantly  increase the capacity, safety, efficiency, and security of air  operations in the NAS. The FAA will continue to evaluate,  standardize and regulate emerging and enhanced  technologies to ensure their safe and advantageous use  in the NAS. One key capability envisioned to achieve these  goals is the concept of equivalent visual operations (EVO),  where flight operations continue irrespective of the actual  weather conditions. One way EVO might be attained is by  using a combined vision system (CVS) which combines  real-time EFVS imagery with a database-derived synthetic  rendering of surrounding terrain, obstacles, and flight  environment, to provide a virtual visual flight depiction  for the pilot.  

# Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)  

The electronic flight bag (EFB) is a system for pilots or  crewmembers that provide a variety of electronic display,  content manipulation, and calculation capabilities.  Functions include, but are not limited to, aeronautical  charts, documents, checklists, weight & balance, fuel  calculations, moving maps, and logbooks.  

EFB systems may manage information for use in the  cockpit, cabin, and/or in support of ground operations  and planning.  The use of an EFB is unique to each aircraft  operator and, depending on the type of operation, EFB use  may require an authorization for use from the FAA issued as  either an operations specification (OpSpec), maintenance  specification (MSpec), or letter of authorization (LOA).  

EFBs can be portable [Figure 5-18] or installed [Figure  5-19] in the aircraft. Portable EFBs may have a provision for  securing in the cockpit for use during all phases of flight.  The hardware device, whether it’s an installed avionics  display or portable commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)  device, commonly referred to as a portable electronic  device (PED), is not considered to be an EFB unless the

The purpose, technology, and functions for EFB use are  rapidly evolving.  New and advanced software applications  and databases beyond traditional flight bag uses continue  to be developed. The FAA has published and continues  to update EFB policy and guidance to educate and assist  aircraft operators interested in using or obtaining an EFB

# Access to Special Use Airspace  

Special use airspace consists of airspace of defined  dimensions identified by an area on the surface of the earth  wherein activities must be confined because of their nature,  or wherein limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations  that are not a part of those activities, or both. Special use  airspace includes: restricted airspace, prohibited airspace,  Military Operations Areas (MOA), warning areas, alert areas,  temporary flight restriction (TFR), and controlled firing  areas (CFAs). [Figures 5-27 through 5-32] Prohibited and  restricted areas are regulatory special use airspace and  are established in 14 CFR Part 73 through the rulemaking  

![](images/434361dc9e6328c52104f19c2f79802440099085e05c6d862a234dff152af3f3.jpg)  
Figure 5-32.  Temporary flight restriction (TFR).  

process. Warning areas, MOAs, alert areas, and CFAs are  non-regulatory special use airspace. All special use airspace  descriptions (except CFAs) are contained in FAA Order JO  7400.8, Special Use Airspace, and are charted on IFR or  visual charts and include the hours of operation, altitudes,  and the controlling agency. [Figure 5-33]  

The vertical limits of special use airspace are measured  by designated altitude floors and ceilings expressed as  flight levels or as feet above mean sea level (MSL). Unless  otherwise specified, the word “to” (an altitude or flight level)  means “to and including” (that altitude or flight level). The  horizontal limits of special use airspace are measured by  boundaries described by geographic coordinates or other  appropriate references that clearly define their perimeter.  The period of time during which a designation of special  use airspace is in effect is stated in the designation.  

# Civilians Using Special Use Airspace  

The FAA and the Department of Defense (DOD) work  together to maximize the use of special use airspace  by opening such areas to civilian traffic when they are  not being used by the military. The military airspace  management system (MAMS) keeps an extensive database  of information on the historical use of special use airspace,  as well as schedules describing when each area is expected  to be active. MAMS transmits the data to the special use  airspace management system (SAMS), an FAA program  that provides current and scheduled status information  on special use airspace to civilian users. The two systems  work together to ensure that the FAA and system users  have current information on a daily basis. This information  is available 24 hours a day at the following link:  http://sua.  faa.gov . The website merges information for both special

use airspace and TFR making it a single comprehensive  source to review airspace closure information.  

The website contains two tabbed pages, List and Map, that  display the scheduling and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) data  for SUAs, military training routes (MTRs), and TFRs. [Figure  5-34] By default, the List tabbed page displays all airspace  types, and the Map tabbed page displays all airspace types  apart from MTRs and ATC Assigned Airspaces (ATCAAs).  Both the List and Map tabbed pages can be filtered to  display specific data for an airspace name, type, or group.  Groups include SUA, MTR, or TFR. The Map tabbed page  provides a graphical depiction of scheduled airspaces  that may be customized using a fly-out menu of map  display options. This tabbed page also contains look-up  functionality that allows a user to locate one or more  airports within the map. [Figures 5-35 through 5-38]  

Additional navigation features are included which allows  the user to pan in any direction by dragging the cursor  within the map. A permalink feature is also available that  enables a user to bookmark a customized set of map layers  that can easily be added to their Internet browser favorites  list. Once a specific set of customized map layers has been  bookmarked, a user may open that customized map display  using the favorites option within their browser menu. The  List tabbed page allows a user to view all SUA and MTR  scheduling data and NOTAM text for a TFR. This text may  be viewed for each NOTAM ID by expanding the NOTAM  text section within the List grid or clicking the NOTAM ID  to open a TFR Details page. The TFR Details page displays  NOTAM text in a form layout for easy reading and includes  a mapped image and sectional navigation map if available  for the TFR.

# Chapter 6    Airborne Navigation Databases  

# Introduction  

Area Navigation (RNAV) systems, aeronautical applications,  and functions that depend on databases are widespread.  [Figure 6-1] Since the 1970s, installed flight systems  have relied on airborne navigation databases to support  their intended functions, such as navigation data used  to facilitate the presentation of flight information to the  flight crew and understanding and better visualization  of the governing aeronautical flight charts. With the  overwhelming upgrades to navigation systems and fully  integrated flight management systems (FMS) that are now  installed in almost all corporate and commercial aircraft,  the need for reliable and consistent airborne navigation  databases is more important than ever.  

![](images/3ea78c421de9dd99d47e4916ddc80aa7d2f83f2039093e5e30d6d8d7a2ee5341.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.  Area navigation (RNAV) receivers.  

The capabilities of airborne navigation databases depend  largely on the way they are implemented by the avionics  manufacturers. They can provide data about a large  variety of locations, routes, and airspace segments for use  by many different types of RNAV equipment. Databases  can provide pilots with information regarding airports,  air traffic control (ATC) frequencies, runways, and special  use airspace. Without airborne navigation databases,  RNAV would be extremely limited. In order to understand  the capabilities and limitations of airborne navigation  databases, pilots must understand the way databases  are compiled and revised by the database provider and  processed by the avionics manufacturer. Vital to this  discussion is understanding of the regulations guiding  database maintenance and use.  

There are many different types of RNAV systems certified  for instrument flight rules (IFR) use in the National Airspace  System (NAS). The two most prevalent types are GPS and  the multisensory FMS. [Figure 6-2] A modern GPS unit  accurately provides the pilot with the aircraft’s present  position; however, it must use an airborne navigation  database to determine its direction or distance from  another location. The database provides the GPS with  

![](images/a080b7a4e817e06569b3e2e650e2eccb0b8ba103a9aed3a44cd00a18311a2fa8.jpg)  

position information for navigation fixes so it may perform  the required geodetic calculations to determine the  appropriate tracks, headings, and distances to be flown.  [Figure 6-3]  

Modern FMS are capable of a large number of functions  including basic en route navigation, complex departure  and arrival navigation, fuel planning, and precise vertical  navigation. Unlike stand-alone navigation systems, most  FMS use several navigation inputs. Typically, they formulate  the aircraft’s current position using a combination of  conventional distance measuring equipment (DME) signals,  inertial navigation systems (INS), GPS receivers, or other  RNAV devices. Like stand-alone navigation avionics, they  rely heavily on airborne navigation databases to provide  the information needed to perform their numerous  functions.  

# Airborne Navigation Database Standardization  

Beginning in the 1970s, the requirement for airborne  navigation databases became more critical. In 1973,  

![](images/f3980addba7443ee5df20a2bf7f241d1a55e61c789ea6081895110f4d2e0b012.jpg)  
Figure 6-2.  GPS with a flight route on display.  

National Airlines installed the Collins ANS-70 and AINS­ 70 RNAV systems in their DC-10 fleet, which marked the  first commercial use of avionics that required navigation  databases. A short time later, Delta Air Lines implemented  the use of an ARMA Corporation RNAV system that also  used a navigation database. Although the type of data  stored in the two systems was basically identical, the  designers created the databases to solve the individual  problems of each system, which meant that they were not  interchangeable. As the implementation of RNAV systems  expanded, a world standard for airborne navigation  databases was needed.  

In 1973, Aeronautical Radio, Inc. (ARINC) sponsored the  formation of a committee to standardize aeronautical  databases. In 1975, the committee published the first  standard, ARINC Specification 424, which has remained the  worldwide accepted format for transmission of navigation  databases.  

# ARINC 424  

ARINC 424 is the air transport industry’s recommended  standard for the preparation and transmission of data for  the assembly of airborne system navigation databases. The  data is intended for merging with the aircraft navigation  system software to provide a source of navigation  reference. Each subsequent version of ARINC 424  Specification provides additional capability for navigation  systems to utilize. Merging of ARINC 424 data with each  manufacturer’s system software is unique and ARINC 424  leg types provide vertical guidance and ground track for  a specific flight procedure. These leg types must provide  repeatable flight tracks for the procedure design. The  navigation database leg type is the path and terminator  concept.  

ARINC 424 Specification describes 23 leg types by their path  and terminator. The path describes how the aircraft gets to  the terminator by flying direct (a heading, a track, a course,  etc.). The terminator is the event or condition that causes  the navigation computer system to switch to the next leg (a  fix, an altitude, an intercept, etc.). When a flight procedure  instructs the pilot to fly runway heading to 2000 feet then  direct to a fix, this is the path and terminator concept. The  path is the heading and the terminator is 2000 feet. The  next leg is then automatically sequenced. A series of leg  types are coded into a navigation database to make a flight  procedure. The navigation database allows an FMS or GPS  navigator to create a continuous display of navigational  data, thus enabling an aircraft to be flown along a specific  route. Vertical navigation can also be coded.  

The data included in an airborne navigation database is  organized into ARINC 424 records. These records are strings  of characters that make up complex descriptions of each  navigation entity. ARINC records can be sorted into four  general groups:  fix records, simple route records, complex  route records, and miscellaneous records. Although it is not  important for pilots to have in-depth knowledge of all the  fields contained in the ARINC 424 records, pilots should be  aware of the types of records contained in the navigation  database and their general content.  

# Fix Records  

Database records that describe specific locations on the  face of the earth can be considered fix records. Navigational  aids (NAVAIDs), waypoints, intersections, and airports are  all examples of this type of record. These records can be  used directly by avionics systems and can be included as  parts of more complex records like airways or approaches.  

Another concept pilots should understand relates to how  aircraft make turns over navigation fixes. Fixes can be  designated as fly-over or fly-by, depending on how they  are used in a specific route. [Figure 6-4] Under certain  circumstances, a navigation fix is designated as fly-over.  This simply means that the aircraft must actually pass  directly over the fix before initiating a turn to a new course.  Conversely, a fix may be designated fly-by, allowing an  aircraft’s navigation system to use its turn anticipation  feature, which ensures that the proper radius of turn is  commanded to avoid overshooting the new course. Some  RNAV systems are not programmed to fully use this feature.  It is important to remember a fix can be coded as fly-over  and fly-by in the same procedure, depending on how the  fix is used (i.e., holding at an initial approach fix). RNAV or  GPS stand-alone IAPs are flown using data pertaining to  the particular IAP obtained from an onboard database  to include the sequence of all waypoints used for the  approach and missed approach, except that step down  waypoints may not be included in some TSO-C129 receiver  databases. Included in the database, in most receivers, is  coding that informs the navigation system of which WPs  are fly-over or fly-by. The navigation system may provide  guidance appropriately to include leading the turn prior  to a fly-by waypoint; or causing over flight of a fly-over  waypoint. Where the navigation system does not provide  such guidance, the pilot must accomplish the turn lead or  waypoint over flight manually. Chart symbology for the fly­ by waypoint provides pilot awareness of expected actions.  

# Simple Route Records  

Route records are those that describe a flightpath  instead of a fixed position. Simple route records contain  

![](images/189d55c76991c77a7b225fdf301ad1b8db139e5baa968cf21da7344c474d74fe.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.  Fly-by-waypoints and fly-over-waypoints.  

strings of fix records and information pertaining to how  the fixes should be used by the navigation avionics.  

A Victor Airway, for example, is described in the database by  a series of en route airway records that contain the names  of fixes in the airway and information about how those  fixes make up the airway.  

# Complex Route Records  

Complex route records include those strings of fixes that  describe complex flightpaths like standard instrument  departures (SIDs), standard terminal arrival routes (STARs),  and instrument approach procedures (IAPs). Like simple  routes, these records contain the names of fixes to be  used in the route, as well as instructions on how the route  is flown.  

# Miscellaneous Records  

There are several other types of information that is coded  into airborne navigation databases, most of which deal  with airspace or communications. The receiver may contain  additional information, such as restricted airspace, airport  minimum safe altitudes, and grid minimum off route  altitudes (MORAs).  

# Path and Terminator Concept  

The path and terminator concept is a means to permit  coding of terminal area procedures, SIDs, STARs, and  approach procedures. Simply put, a textual description of  a route or a terminal procedure is translated into a format  that is useable in RNAV systems. One of the most important  concepts for pilots to learn regarding the limitations of  RNAV equipment has to do with the way these systems  deal with the path and terminator field included in complex  route records.  

The first RNAV systems were capable of only one type of  navigation; they could fly directly to a fix. This was not a  problem when operating in the en route environment  in which airways are mostly made up of direct routes  between fixes. The early approaches for RNAV did not  present problems for these systems and the databases  they used because they consisted mainly of DME/DME  overlay approaches flown only direct point-to-point  navigation. The desire for RNAV equipment to have the  ability to follow more complicated flightpaths necessitated  the development of the path and terminator field that is  included in complex route records.  

# Path and Terminator Legs  

There are currently 23 different leg types, or path and  terminators that have been created in the ARINC 424  standard that enable RNAV systems to follow the complex  paths that make up instrument departures, arrivals, and  approaches. They describe to navigation avionics a path  to be followed and the criteria that must be met before  the path concludes and the next path begins. Although  there are 23 leg types available, none of the manufactured  database equipment is capable of using all of the leg types.  Pilots must continue to monitor procedures for accuracy  and not rely solely on the information that the database  is showing. If the RNAV system does not have the leg type

demanded by procedures, data packers have to select one  or a combination of available lleg types to give the best  approximation, which can result in an incorrect execution  of the procedure. Below is a list of the 23 leg types and  their uses that may or may not be used by all databases.

Figure 6-25.  Racetrack course reversal or HA, HF, and HM leg.  

The GRAND JUNCTION FIVE DEPARTURE for Grand Junction  Regional in Grand Junction, Colorado, provides a good  example of different types of path and terminator legs  used. [Figure 6-26] When this procedure is coded into the  navigation database, the person entering the data into the  records must identify the individual legs of the flightpath  and then determine which type of terminator should be  used.  

The first leg of the departure for Runway 11 is a climb  via runway heading to 6,000 feet mean sea level (MSL)  and then a climbing right turn direct to a fix. When this is  entered into the database, a heading to an altitude (VA)  value must be entered into the record’s path and terminator  field for the first leg of the departure route. This path and  terminator tells the avionics to provide course guidance  based on heading, until the aircraft reaches 6,000 feet,  and then the system begins providing course guidance  for the next leg. After reaching 6,000 feet, the procedure  calls for a right turn direct to the Grand Junction (JNC)  VORTAC. This leg is coded into the database using the path  and terminator direct to a fix (DF) value, which defines an  unspecified track starting from an undefined position to a  specific database fix.  

Another commonly used path and terminator value is  heading to a radial (VR) which is shown in Figure 6-27  using the CHANNEL ONE DEPARTURE procedure for Santa  Ana, California. The first leg of the runway 19L/R procedure  requires a climb on runway heading until crossing the I-SNA  1 DME fix or the SLI R-118, this leg must be coded into the  database using the VR value in the Path and Terminator  field. After crossing the I-SNA 1 DME fix or the SLI R-118, the  avionics should cycle to the next leg of the procedure that  in this case, is a climb on a heading of   $175^{\circ}$   until crossing SLI  R-132. This leg is also coded with a VR Path and Terminator.  The next leg of the procedure consists of a heading of  $200^{\circ}$  until intercepting the SXC R-084. In order for the avionics to  correctly process this leg, the database record must include  the heading to an intercept (VI) value in the Path and  Terminator field. This value directs the avionics to follow  a specified heading to intercept the subsequent leg at an  unspecified position.  

The path and terminator concept is a very important part  of airborne navigation database coding. In general, it is not  necessary for pilots to have an in-depth knowledge of the  ARINC coding standards; however, pilots should be familiar  with the concepts related to coding in order to understand  the limitations of specific RNAV systems that use databases.  

# Path and Terminator Limitations  

How a specific RNAV system deals with Path and  Terminators is of great importance to pilots operating  with airborne navigation databases. Some early RNAV  systems may ignore this field completely. The ILS or LOC/  DME RWY 3 approach at Durango, Colorado, provides an  example of problems that may arise from the lack of path  and terminator capability in RNAV systems. Although  approaches of this type are authorized only for sufficiently  equipped RNAV systems, it is possible that a pilot may elect  to fly the approach with conventional navigation, and then  re-engage RNAV during a missed approach. If this missed  approach is flown using an RNAV system that does not use  Path and terminator values or the wrong leg types, then  the system will most likely ignore the first two legs of the  procedure. This will cause the RNAV equipment to direct  

![](images/fd43c9a36ccc467700bdd158c0280e0e1bf8df4360af5e0ad0ad3e24a3610c51.jpg)

the pilot to make an immediate turn toward the Durango  VOR instead of flying the series of headings that terminate  at specific altitudes as dictated by the approach procedure.  [Figure 6-28] Pilots must be aware of their individual  systems Path and Terminator handling characteristics  and always review the manufacturer’s documentation to  familiarize themselves with the capabilities of the RNAV  equipment they are operating. Pilots should be aware that  some RNAV equipment was designed without the fly-over  capability which can cause problems for pilots attempting  to use this equipment to fly complex flightpaths in the  departure, arrival, or approach environments.  

# Role of the Database Provider  

Compiling and maintaining a worldwide airborne  navigation database is a large and complex job. Within the  United States, the FAA sources give the database providers  information, in many different formats, which must be  analyzed, edited, and processed before it can be coded  into the database. In some cases, data from outside the  United States must be translated into English so it may be  analyzed and entered into the database. Once the data is  coded, it must be continually updated and maintained.  

Once the FAA notifies the database provider that a change  is necessary, the update process begins. The change is  incorporated into a 28-day airborne database revision cycle  based on its assigned priority. If the information does not  reach the coding phase prior to its cutoff date (the date that  new aeronautical information can no longer be included  in the next update), it is held out of revision until the next  cycle. The cutoff date for aeronautical databases is typically  

# 21 days prior to the effective date of the revision.  

The integrity of the data is ensured through a process called  cyclic redundancy check (CRC). A CRC is an error detection  algorithm capable of detecting small bit-level changes in  a block of data. The CRC algorithm treats a data block as  a single, large binary value. The data block is divided by a  fixed binary number called a generator polynomial whose  form and magnitude is determined based on the level of  integrity desired. The remainder of the division is the CRC  value for the data block. This value is stored and transmitted  with the corresponding data block. The integrity of the  data is checked by reapplying the CRC algorithm prior to  distribution.  

# Role of the Avionics Manufacturer  

When avionics manufacturers develop a piece of  equipment that requires an airborne navigation database,  they typically form an agreement with a database provider  to supply the database for that new avionics platform. It  is up to the manufacturer to determine what information  to include in the database for their system. In some cases,  the navigation data provider has to significantly reduce the  number of records in the database to accommodate the  storage capacity of the manufacturer’s new product, which  means that the database may not contain all procedures.  

Another important fact to remember is that although there  are standard naming conventions included in the ARINC  424 specification, each manufacturer determines how  the names of fixes and procedures are displayed to the  pilot. This means that although the database may specify  

![](images/7b14a10e2b96826096430b774b7aaeae4229e091173252a8cad0f6e4165151fb.jpg)  
Figure 6-29.  Naming conventions of three different systems for the VOR 34 Approach.  

the approach identifier field for the VOR/DME Runway  34 approach at Eugene Mahlon Sweet Airport (KEUG) in  Eugene, Oregon, as   $"\lor34,\prime$  different avionics platforms  may display the identifier in any way the manufacturer  deems appropriate. For example, a GPS produced by one  manufacturer might display the approach as “VOR   $34,\prime$  whereas another might refer to the approach as “VOR/DME   $34,$  and an FMS produced by another manufacturer may  refer to it as “VOR34.” [Figure 6-29]  

These differences can cause visual inconsistencies between  chart and GPS displays, as well as confusion with approach  clearances and other ATC instructions for pilots unfamiliar  with specific manufacturer’s naming conventions. The  manufacturer determines the capabilities and limitations  of an RNAV system based on the decisions that it makes  regarding that system’s processing of the airborne  navigation database.  

# Users Role  

Like paper charts, airborne navigation databases are  subject to revision. According to 14 CFR Part 91, § 91.503,  the end user (operator) is ultimately responsible for  ensuring that data meets the quality requirements for its  intended application. Updating data in an aeronautical  database is considered to be maintenance and all Part 91  operators may update databases in accordance with 14  CFR Part 91,   $\S\ 43.3({\tt g})$  . Parts 121, 125, and 135 operators  must update databases in accordance with their approved  maintenance program. For Part 135 helicopter operators,  this includes maintenance by the pilot in accordance with  

![](images/c1ec30b8aba9e581805039c5d17060cc2e9da23649b3b4ae0984192ad52d3dc4.jpg)  

# 14 CFR Part 43, § 43.3(h).  

Pilots using the databases are ultimately responsible for  ensuring that the database they are operating with is  current. This includes checking Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)­ type information concerning errors that may be supplied  by the avionics manufacturer or the database supplier. The  database user is responsible for learning how the specific  navigation equipment handles the navigation database.  The manufacturer’s documentation is the pilot’s best source  of information regarding the capabilities and limitations of  a specific database. [Figure 6-30]  

# Operational Limitations of Airborne Navigation  Databases  

Understanding the capabilities and limitations of the  navigation systems installed in an aircraft is one of the  pilot’s biggest concerns for IFR flight. Considering the vast  number of RNAV systems and pilot interfaces available  today, it is critical that pilots and flight crews be familiar  with the manufacturer’s operating manual for each RNAV  system they operate and achieve and retain proficiency  operating those systems in the IFR environment.  

Most professional and general aviation pilots are familiar  with the possible human factors issues related to flightdeck  automation. It is particularly important to consider those  issues when using airborne navigation databases. Although  modern avionics can provide precise guidance throughout  all phases of flight, including complex departures and  arrivals, not all systems have the same capabilities.  

RNAV equipment installed in some aircraft is limited to  direct route point-to-point navigation. Therefore, it is  very important for pilots to familiarize themselves with  the capabilities of their systems through review of the  manufacturer documentation. Most modern RNAV systems  are contained within an integrated avionics system that  receives input from several different navigation and aircraft  system sensors. These integrated systems provide so much  information that pilots may sometimes fail to recognize  errors in navigation caused by database discrepancies or  misuse. Pilots must constantly ensure that the data they  enter into their avionics is accurate and current. Once  the transition to RNAV is made during a flight, pilots and  flight crews must always be capable and ready to revert to  conventional means of navigation if problems arise.  

# Closed Indefinitely Airports  

Some U.S. airports have been closed for up to several years,  with little or no chance that they will ever reopen; yet their  “indefinite” closure status – as opposed to permanent or  UFN closure, or abandonment – causes them to continue  to appear on both VFR and IFR charts and in airborne  navigation databases; and their instrument approach  procedures, if any, continue to be included – and still  appear to be valid – in the paper and electronic versions  of the United States Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP)  charts. Airpark South, 2K2, at Ozark, Missouri, is a case in  point.  

Even though this airport has been closed going on two  years and, due to industrial and residential development  surrounding it, likely will never be reopened, the airport  is nonetheless still charted in a way that could easily lead  a pilot to believe that it is still open and operating. Even  the current U.S. Low Altitude En route chart displays a  blue symbol for this airport, indicating that it still has  a Department of Defense (DOD) approved instrument  approach procedure available for use.  

Aircrews need to use caution when selecting an airport  in a cautionary or emergency situation, especially if the  airport was not previously analyzed suitable for diversion  during preflight.  Aircrews could assume, based on charts  and their FMS database, the airport is suitable and perhaps  the only available diversionary or emergency option.  The  airport however, could be closed and hazardous even for  emergency use. In these situations, Air Traffic Control may  be queried for the airport’s status.  

# Storage Limitations  

As the data in a worldwide database grows, the required  data storage space increases. Over the years that panel-  mounted GPS and FMSs  have developed, the size of the  commercially available airborne navigation databases has  grown exponentially.  

Some manufacturer’s systems have kept up with this  growth and some have not. Many of the limitations of  older RNAV systems are a direct result of limited data  storage capacity. For this reason, avionics manufacturers  must make decisions regarding which types of procedures  will be included with their system. For instance, older GPS  units rarely include all of the waypoints that are coded into  master databases. Even some modern FMS equipment,  which typically have much larger storage capacity, do not  include all of the data that is available from the database  producers. The manufacturers often choose not to include  certain types of data that they think is of low importance  to the usability of the unit. For example, manufacturers  of FMS used in large airplanes may elect not to include  airports where the longest runway is less than 3,000 feet  or to include all the procedures for an airport.  

Manufacturers of RNAV equipment can reduce the size of  the data storage required in their avionics by limiting the  geographic area the database covers. Like paper charts, the  amount of data that needs to be carried with the aircraft is  directly related to the size of the coverage area. Depending  on the data storage that is available, this means that the  larger the required coverage area, the less detailed the  database can be.  

Again, due to the wide range of possible storage capacities,  and the number of different manufacturers and product  lines, the manufacturer’s documentation is the pilot’s best  source of information regarding limitations caused by  storage capacity of RNAV avionics.  

# Charting/Database Inconsistencies  

It is important for pilots to remember that many  inconsistencies may exist between aeronautical charts  and airborne navigation databases. Since there are so  many sources of information included in the production  of these materials, and the data is manipulated by several  different organizations before it is eventually displayed  on RNAV equipment, the possibility is high that there will  be noticeable differences between the charts and the  databases. Because of this, pilots must be familiar with the  capabilities of the database and have updated aeronautical  charts while flying to ensure the proper course is being  flown.  

# Naming Conventions  

Obvious differences exist between the names of procedures  shown on charts and those that appear on the displays of  many RNAV systems. Most of these differences can be  accounted for simply by the way the avionics manufacturers  elect to display the information to the pilot. It is the avionics  manufacturer that creates the interface between the pilot  and the database. For example, the VOR 12R approach in  San Jose, California, might be displayed several different  ways depending on how the manufacturer designs the  pilot interface. Some systems display procedure names  exactly as they are charted, but many do not.  

The naming of multiple approaches of the same type to the  same runway is also changing. Multiple approaches with  the same guidance will be annotated with an alphabetical  suffix beginning at the end of the alphabet and working  backwards for subsequent procedures (e.g., ILS Z RWY  28, ILS Y RWY 28, etc.). The existing annotations, such as  ILS 2 RWY 28 or Silver ILS RWY 28, will be phased out and  replaced with the new designation.  

NAVAIDs are also subject to naming discrepancies as well.  This problem is complicated by the fact that multiple  NAVAIDs can be designated with the same identifier. VOR  XYZ may occur several times in a provider’s database, so  the avionics manufacturer must design a way to identify  these fixes by a more specific means than the three-letter  identifier. Selection of geographic region is used in most  instances to narrow the pilot’s selection of NAVAIDs with  like identifiers.  

Non-directional beacons (NDBs) and locator outer markers  (LOMs) can be displayed differently than they are charted.  When the first airborne navigation databases were being  implemented, NDBs were included in the database as  waypoints instead of NAVAIDs. This necessitated the use  of five character identifiers for NDBs. Eventually, the NDBs  were coded into the database as NAVAIDs, but many of  the RNAV systems in use today continue to use the five- character identifier. These systems display the characters  “NB” after the charted NDB identifier. Therefore, NDB ABC  would be displayed as “ABCNB.”  

Other systems refer to NDB NAVAIDs using either the NDB’s  charted name if it is five or fewer letters, or the one to three  character identifier. PENDY NDB located in North Carolina,  for instance, is displayed on some systems as“PENDY,”while  other systems might only display the NDBs identifier “ACZ.”  [Figure 6-31]  

Using the VOR/DME Runway 34 approach at Eugene  Mahlon Sweet Airport (KEUG) in Eugene, Oregon, as  another example, which is named V34, may be displayed  differently by another avionics platform. For example, a  GPS produced by one manufacturer might display the  approach as VOR 34, whereas another might refer to the  approach as VOR/DME 34, and an FMS produced by another  manufacturer may refer to it as VOR34. These differences  can cause visual inconsistencies between chart and GPS  displays, as well as confusion with approach clearances  and other ATC instructions for pilots unfamiliar with specific  manufacturer’s naming conventions.

# Issues Related To Magnetic Variation  

Magnetic variations for locations coded into airborne  navigation databases can be acquired in several ways. In  many cases they are supplied by government agencies in  the epoch year variation format. Theoretically, this value  is determined by government sources and published for  public use every five years. Providers of airborne navigation  databases do not use annual drift values; instead the  database uses the epoch year variation until it is updated by  the appropriate source provider. In the United States, this  is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA). In some cases the variation for a given location is  a value that has been calculated by the avionics system.  These dynamic magnetic variation values can be different  than those used for locations during aeronautical charting  and must not be used for conventional NAVAIDs or airports.  

Discrepancies can occur for many reasons. Even when the  variation values from the database are used, the resulting  calculated course might be different from the course  depicted on the charts. Using the magnetic variation for the  region instead of the actual station declination can result  in differences between charted and calculated courses and  

![](images/33224916a359a92171dd24b5f5231f157637d06ce6a423b8ab1b8d097acd2415.jpg)  
Figure 6-31.  Manufacturer’s naming conventions.  

incorrect ground track. Station declination is only updated  when a NAVAID is site checked by the governing authority  that controls it, so it is often different than the current  magnetic variation for that location. Using an onboard  means of determining variation usually entails coding  some sort of earth model into the avionics memory. Since  magnetic variation for a given location changes predictably  over time, this model may only be correct for one time in  the lifecycle of the avionics. This means that if the intended  lifecycle of a GPS unit were 20 years, the point at which the  variation model might be correct would be when the GPS  unit was 10 years old. The discrepancy would be greatest  when the unit was new, and again near the end of its life  span.  

Another issue that can cause slight differences between  charted course values and those in the database  occurs when a terminal procedure is coded using  magnetic variation of record. When approaches or other  procedures are designed, the designers use specific rules  to apply variation to a given procedure. Some controlling  government agencies may elect to use the epoch year  variation of an airport to define entire procedures at that  airport. This may result in course discrepancies between  the charted value and the value calculated using the actual  variations from the database.  

# Issues Related To Revision Cycle  

Pilots should be aware that the length of the airborne  navigation database revision cycle could cause  discrepancies between aeronautical charts and information  derived from the database. One important difference  between aeronautical charts and databases is the length  of cutoff time. Cutoff refers to the length of time between  the last day that changes can be made in the revision, and  the date the information becomes effective. Aeronautical  charts typically have a cutoff date of 10 days prior to the  effective date of the charts.  

# Chapter 7    Helicopter Instrument Procedures  

Introduction  

This chapter presents information on IFR helicopter  operations in the National Airspace System. Advances in  avionics technology installed in helicopters such as Global  Positioning System (GPS) and Wide Area Augmentation  System (WAAS) are bringing approach procedures to  heliports around the country.  

The ability to operate helicopters under IFR increases  their utility and safety. Helicopter IFR operators have  an excellent safety record due to the investment in  IFR-equipped helicopters, development of instrument  approach procedures (IAPs), and IFR-trained flight crews.  The safety record of IFR operations in the Gulf of Mexico is  equivalent to the safety record of the best-rated airlines.  Manufacturers are working to increase IFR all-weather  capabilities of helicopters by providing slower minimum  instrument airspeeds   $\left(\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}\right)$  , faster cruising speeds, and  better autopilots and flight management systems (FMS).  As a result, in October 2005, the first civil helicopter in  the United States was certified for flight into known icing  conditions. [Figure 7-1]  

![](images/048c876812d475edaa8581da5f35f3cf858a488b200c78f714bcc800b5fa0b59.jpg)

Figure 7-1.  Icing tests. To safely provide an all-weather capability  and flight into known icing conditions that would otherwise delay  or cancel winter flight operations, the digital control of the S-92  Rotor Ice Protection System (RIPS) determines the temperature and  moisture content of the air and removes any ice buildup by heating the  main and tail rotor blades. The system is shown here during testing.  

# Helicopter Instrument Flight Rule (IFR)  Certification  

It is very important that pilots be familiar with the IFR  requirements for their particular helicopter. Within the  same make, model, and series of helicopter, variations in  the installed avionics may change the required equipment  or the level of augmentation for a particular operation. The  Automatic Flight Control System/Autopilot/Flight Director  (AFCS/AP/FD) equipment installed in IFR helicopters can  be very complex. For some helicopters, the AFCS/AP/  FD complexity requires formal training in order for the  pilot(s) to obtain and maintain a high level of knowledge  of system operation, limitations, failure indications, and  reversionary modes. For a helicopter to be certified  to conduct operations in instrument meteorological  conditions (IMC), it must meet the design and installation  requirements of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) Part 27, Appendix B (Normal Category) and Part 29,  Appendix B (Transport Category), which is in addition to  the visual flight rule (VFR) requirements.  

These requirements are broken down into the  following categories: flight and navigation equipment,  miscellaneous requirements, stability, helicopter flight  manual limitations, operations specifications, and  minimum equipment list (MEL).  

# Flight and Navigation Equipment  

The basic installed flight and navigation equipment for  helicopter IFR operations is listed under 14 CFR Part 29, §  29.1303, with amendments and additions in Appendix B of  14 CFR Parts 27 and 29 under which they are certified. The  list includes:  

•   Clock  •   Airspeed indicator  •   Sensitive altimeter (A “sensitive” altimeter relates to  the instrument’s displayed change in altitude over  its range. For “Copter” Category (CAT) II operations,  the scale must be in 20-foot intervals.) adjustable  for barometric pressure.  •   Magnetic direction indicator  •   Free-air temperature indicator  •   Rate-of-climb (vertical speed) indicator  •   Magnetic gyroscopic direction indicator  •   Stand-by bank and pitch (attitude) indicator  •   Non-tumbling gyroscopic bank and pitch (attitude)  indicator  •   Speed warning device (if required by 14 CFR Part 29)  

# Miscellaneous Requirements  

•   Overvoltage disconnect  •   Instrument power source indicator  •   Adequate ice protection of IFR systems  •   Alternate static source (single-pilot configuration)  •   Thunderstorm lights (transport category helicopters)  

# Stabilization and Automatic Flight Control  System (AFCS)  

Helicopter manufacturers normally use a combination  of a stabilization and/or AFCS in order to meet the IFR  stability requirements of 14 CFR Parts 27 and 29. These  systems include:  

•   Aerodynamic surfaces, which impart some stability  or control capability that generally is not found in  the basic VFR configuration.  •   Trim systems provide a cyclic centering effect. These  systems typically involve a magnetic brake/spring  device and may be controlled by a four-way switch  on the cyclic. This system requires “hands on” flying  of the helicopter.  •   Stability Augmentation Systems (SAS) provide  short-term rate damping control inputs to increase  helicopter stability. Like trim systems, SAS requires  “hands-on” flying.  

•   Attitude Retention Systems (ATT) return the  helicopter to a selected attitude after a disturbance.  Changes in attitude can be accomplished usually  through a four- way “beep” switch or by actuating a  “force trim” switch on the cyclic, which sets the desired  attitude manually. Attitude retention may be a SAS  function or may be the basic “hands off” autopilot  function.  

•   Autopilot Systems (APs) provide for “hands off”  flight along specified lateral and vertical paths. The  functional modes may include heading, altitude,  vertical speed, navigation tracking, and approach.  APs typically have a control panel for mode selection  and indication of mode status. APs may or may not be  installed with an associated FD. APs typically control  the helicopter about the roll and pitch axes (cyclic  control) but may also include yaw axis (pedal control)  and collective control servos.  

Flight Directors (FDs) provide visual guidance to  the pilot to fly selected lateral and vertical modes of  operation. The visual guidance is typically provided  by a “single cue,” commonly known as a “vee bar,”  which provides the indicated attitude to fly and  is superimposed on the attitude indicator. Other  FDs may use a “two cue” presentation known as a  “cross pointer system.” These two presentations  only provide attitude information. A third system,  known as a “three cue” system, provides information  to position the collective as well as attitude (roll  and pitch) cues. The collective control cue system  identifies and cues the pilot what collective control  inputs to use when path errors are produced or when  airspeed errors exceed preset values. The three-cue  system pitch command provides the required cues  to control airspeed when flying an approach with  vertical guidance at speeds slower than the best-   rate-of-climb (BROC) speed. The pilot manipulates  the helicopter’s controls to satisfy these commands,  yielding the desired flightpath or may couple the  autopilot to the FD to fly along the desired flightpath.  Typically, FD mode control and indication are shared  with the autopilot. Pilots must be aware of the mode  of operation of the augmentation systems and the  control logic and functions in use. For example, on an  instrument landing system (ILS) approach and using  the three-cue mode (lateral, vertical, and collective  cues), the FD collective cue responds to glideslope  deviation, while the horizontal bar cue of the “cross­ pointer” responds to airspeed deviations. However,  the same system when operated in the two-cue  mode on an ILS, the FD horizontal bar cue responds  to glideslope deviations. The need to be aware of the  FD mode of operation is particularly significant when  operating using two pilots.  

Pilots should have an established set of procedures and  responsibilities for the control of FD/AP modes for the  various phases of flight. Not only does a full understanding  of the system modes provide for a higher degree of  accuracy in control of the helicopter, it is the basis for crew  identification of a faulty system.  

# Helicopter Flight Manual Limitations  

Helicopters are certificated for IFR operations with either  one or two pilots. Certain equipment is required to be  installed and functional for two-pilot operations and  additional equipment is required for single-pilot operation.  

In addition, the Helicopter Flight Manual (HFM) defines  systems and functions that are required to be in operation  or engaged for IFR flight in either the single or two-pilot  configurations. Often, in a two-pilot operation, this level of  augmentation is less than the full capability of the installed  systems. Likewise, a single-pilot operation may require a  higher level of augmentation.  

The HFM also identifies other specific limitations associated  with IFR flight. Typically, these limitations include, but are  not limited to:  

•     Minimum equipment required for IFR flight (in some  cases, for both single-pilot and two-pilot operations)  •   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{MNN}}$   (minimum speed—IFR) [Figure 7-2]  •   ${\sf V}_{\sf N E I}$   (never exceed speed—IFR)  •    Maximum approach angle  •    Weight and center of gravity (CG) limits  •    Helicopter configuration limitations (such as door  positions and external loads)  •     Helicopter system limitations (generators, inverters,  etc.)  •     System testing requirements (many avionics and AFCS,  AP , and FD systems incorporate a self-test feature)  •     Pilot action requirements (for example, the pilot must  have hands and feet on the controls during certain  operations, such as an instrument approach below  certain altitudes)  

Final approach angles/descent gradient for public  approach procedures can be as high as 7.5 degrees/795  ft/NM. At 70 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) (no wind),  this equates to a descent rate of 925 fpm. With a 10-knot  tailwind, the descent rate increases to 1,056 fpm. “Copter”  Point-in-space (PinS) approach procedures are restricted  to helicopters with a maximum  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$   of 70 KIAS and an  IFR approach angle that enables them to meet the final  approach angle/descent gradient. Pilots of helicopters with  

![](images/3b9f176b036e97a2c15474e7ebe915a87f041237a62c76e94c3a3b8d0df2d65d.jpg)  
Figure  $7–2.\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{M|N|}}$   limitations, maximum IFR approach angles and  $\mathsf{G}/\mathsf{A}$   mode speeds for selected IFR certified helicopters.  

a   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$   of 70 KIAS may have inadequate control margins  to fly an approach that is designed with the maximum  allowable angle/descent gradient or minimum allowable  deceleration distance from the missed approach point  (MAP) to the heliport. The “Copter” PinS final approach  segment is limited to 70 KIAS since turn containment and  the deceleration distance from the MAP to the heliport may  not be adequate at faster speeds. For some helicopters,  engaging the autopilot may increase the  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$   to a speed  greater than   $70~{\mathsf{K l A S}},$   or in the “go around” (G/A) mode,  require a speed faster than 70 KIAS. [Figure 7-2] It may be  possible for these helicopters to be flown manually on the  approach or on the missed approach in a mode other than  the G/A mode.  

Since slower IFR approach speeds enable the helicopter  to fly steeper approaches and reduces the distance from  the heliport that is required to decelerate the helicopter,  you may want to operate your helicopter at speeds slower  than its established  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{M}\mathsf{I}\mathsf{N}\mathsf{I}}$  . The provision to apply for a  determination of equivalent safety for instrument flight  below  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{MINI}}$   and the minimum helicopter requirements  are specified in Advisory Circulars (AC) 27-1, Certification  of Normal Category Rotorcraft and AC 29-2, Certification  of Transport Category Rotorcraft.  Application guidance is  available from the Rotorcraft Directorate Standards Staff,  ASW-110, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Fort Worth, Texas, 76137­ 4298, (817) 222-5111.  

Performance data may not be available in the HFM for  speeds other than the best rate of climb speed. To meet  missed approach climb gradients, pilots may use observed  performance for similar weight, altitude, temperature, and  speed conditions to determine equivalent performance.  When missed approaches utilizing a climbing turn are  flown with an autopilot, set the heading bug on the  missed approach heading, and then at the MAP, engage  the indicated airspeed mode, followed immediately by  applying climb power and selecting the heading mode.  This is important since the autopilot roll rate and maximum  bank angle in the Heading Select mode are significantly  more robust than in the NAV mode. Figure 7-3 represents  the bank angle and roll limits of the S76 used by the FAA for  flight testing. It has a roll rate in the Heading Select mode  of 5 degrees per second with only 1 degree per second in  the NAV mode. The bank angle in the Heading Select mode  is 20 degrees, with only 17 degrees in the NAV Change  Over mode. Furthermore, if the Airspeed Hold mode is  not selected on some autopilots when commencing the  missed approach, the helicopter accelerates in level flight  until the best rate of climb is attained, and only then will  a climb begin.

WAAS localizer performance (LP) lateral-only PinS testing  conducted in 2005 by the FAA at the William J. Hughes  Technical Center in New Jersey for helicopter PinS also  captured the flight tracks for turning missed approaches.  [Figure 7-4] The large flight tracks that resulted during  the turning missed approach were attributed in part to  operating the autopilot in the NAV mode and exceeding  the 70 KIAS limit.  

# Operations Specifications  

A flight operated under 14 CFR Part 135 has minimums and  procedures more restrictive than a flight operated under  14 CFR Part 91. These Part 135 requirements are detailed  in their operations specifications (OpSpecs). Helicopter Air  Ambulance (HAA) operators have even more restrictive  OpSpecs. Shown in Figure 7-5 is an excerpt from an  OpSpecs detailing the minimums for precision approaches.  The inlay in Figure 7-5 shows the minimums for the ILS  Runway 3R approach at Detroit Metro Airport.  With all  lighting operative, the minimums for helicopter Part 91  operations are a 200-foot ceiling, and 1,200-feet runway  visual range (RVR) - one-half airplane Category A visibility  but no less than 1⁄4 SM/1,200 RVR.  However, as shown in  

![](images/3ebcb5191230b1aa853ee4a357f66c7da60bee966621d927c54c18dafece379a.jpg)  
Figure 7-4.  Flight tests at the William J. Hughes Technical Center  point out the importance of airspeed control and using the correct  technique to make a turning missed approach.  

the OpSpecs, the minimum visibility this Part 135 operator  must adhere to is 1,600 RVR. Pilots operating under 14 CFR  Part 91 are encouraged to develop their own personal  OpSpecs based on their own equipment, training, and  experience.  

# Minimum Equipment List (MEL)  

A helicopter operating under 14 CFR Part 135 with  certain installed equipment inoperative is prohibited  from taking off unless the operation is authorized in the  approved MEL. The MEL provides for some equipment to  be inoperative if certain conditions are met. [Figure 7-6]  In many cases, a helicopter configured for single-pilot  IFR may depart IFR with certain equipment inoperative  provided a crew of two pilots is used. Under 14 CFR Part  91, a pilot may defer certain items without an MEL if  those items are not required by the type certificate, CFRs,  or airworthiness directives (ADs), and the flight can be  performed safely without them. If the item is disabled,  removed, or marked inoperative, a logbook entry is made.  

# Pilot Proficiency  

Helicopters of the same make and model may have  variations in installed avionics that change the required  equipment or the level of augmentation for a particular  operation. The complexity of modern AFCS, AP, and FD  systems requires a high degree of understanding to safely  

Figure 7-6.  Example of a Minimum Equipment List (MEL).  

and efficiently control the helicopter in IFR operations.  Formal training in the use of these systems is highly  recommended for all pilots.  

During flight operations, you must be aware of the mode  of operation of the augmentation system and the control  logic and functions employed. [Figure 7-2]  

# Helicopter VFR Minimums  

Helicopters have the same VFR minimums as airplanes  with two exceptions. In Class G airspace or under a special  visual flight rule (SVFR) clearance, helicopters have no  minimum visibility requirement but must remain clear of  clouds and operate at a speed that is slow enough to give  the pilot an adequate opportunity to see other aircraft or an  obstruction in time to avoid a collision. Helicopters are also  authorized (14 CFR Part 91, appendix D, § 3) to obtain SVFR  clearances at airports with the designation NO SVFR on the  sectional chart or in the Chart Supplement (CS). Figure 7-7  shows the visibility and cloud clearance requirements for  VFR and SVFR. However, lower minimums associated with  Class G airspace and SVFR do not take the place of the VFR  minimum requirements of either Part 135 regulations or  respective OpSpecs.  

Knowledge of all VFR minimums is required in order to  determine if a PinS approach can be conducted or if a SVFR  clearance is required to continue past the (MAP). These  approaches and procedures are discussed in detail later.  

# Helicopter IFR Takeoff Minimums  

14 CFR Part 91 imposes no takeoff minimums on the  helicopter pilot.  However, Rotorcraft Flight Manuals  may require the helicopter to attain at least Vmini before  entering IMC. For most helicopters, this requires a distance  of approximately 1⁄2 mile and an altitude of 100 feet. If  departing with a steeper climb gradient, some helicopters  may require additional altitude to accelerate to   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{MNN}}$  .  To maximize safety, always consider using the Part 135  operator standard takeoff visibility minimum of  $^{1/2}$   statute  mile (SM) or the charted departure minima, whichever is  higher. A charted departure that provides protection from  obstacles has either a higher visibility requirement, climb  gradient, and/or departure path. Part 135 operators are  required to adhere to the takeoff minimums prescribed in  the instrument approach procedures (IAPs) for the airport.  

# Helicopter IFR Alternates  

The pilot must file for an alternate if weather reports and  forecasts at the proposed destination do not meet certain  minimums. These minimums differ for Part 91 and Part  135 operators.  

![](images/91b2d2e2aea8180b22c279f0ca69de22870d5ab0a32930f11601beed640a7836.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.  Helicopter VFR minimums.  

# Part 91 Operators  

Part 91 operators are not required to file an alternate if, at  the estimated time of arrival (ETA) and for 1 hour after, the  ceiling is at least 1,000 feet above the airport elevation or  400 feet above the lowest applicable approach minima,  whichever is higher, and the visibility is at least 2 SM. If an  alternate is required, an airport can be used if the ceiling is  at least 200 feet above the minimum for the approach to  be flown and visibility is at least 1 SM, but never less than  the minimum required for the approach to be flown. If no  instrument approach procedure has been published for the  alternate airport, the ceiling and visibility minima are those  allowing descent from the MEA, approach, and landing  under basic VFR.  

# Part 135 Operators  

Part 135 operators are not required to file an alternate if,  for at least one hour before and one hour after the ETA,  the ceiling is at least 1,500 feet above the lowest circling  approach minimum descent altitude (MDA). If a circling  instrument approach is not authorized for the airport,  the ceiling must be at least 1,500 feet above the lowest  published minimum or 2,000 feet above the airport  elevation, whichever is higher. For the IAP to be used at  the destination airport, the forecasted visibility for that  airport must be at least 3 SM or 2 SM more than the lowest  applicable visibility minimums, whichever is greater.  

Alternate landing minimums for flights conducted under 14  CFR Part 135 are described in the OpSpecs for that  operation. All helicopters operated under IFR must carry  enough fuel to fly to the intended destination, fly from that  airport to the filed alternate, if required, and continue for  30 minutes at normal cruising speed.  

# Helicopter Instrument Approaches  

Many  new helicopter IAPs have been developed to take  advantage of advances in both avionics and helicopter  technology.  

# Standard Instrument Approach Procedures to  an Airport  

Helicopters flying standard instrument approach  procedures (SIAP) must adhere to the MDA or decision  altitude for Category A airplanes and may apply the 14  

![](images/9a37714fab7def2479ba5844b8fe5d49115f37c7747420b0f16efe0908fa2dff.jpg)  
Figure 7-8.  Part 97 excerpt.  

CFR Part 97.3 (d-1) rule to reduce the airplane Category A  visibility by half but in no case less than 1⁄4 SM or 1,200 RVR.  [Figure 7-8] The approach can be initiated at any speed up  to the highest approach category authorized; however, the  speed on the final approach segment must be reduced to  the Category A speed of less than 90 KIAS before the MAP in  order to apply the visibility reduction. A constant airspeed  is recommended on the final approach segment to comply  with the stabilized approach concept since a decelerating  approach may make early detection of wind shear on the  approach path more difficult. [Figure 7-9]  

When visibility minimums must be increased for inoperative  components or visual aids, use the Inoperative Components  and Visual Aids Table (provided in the front cover of the U.S.  Terminal Procedures) to derive the Category A minima before  applying any visibility reduction. The published visibility  may be increased above the standard visibility minima due  to penetrations of the 20:1 and 34:1 final approach obstacle  identification surfaces (OIS). The minimum visibility required  for 34:1 penetrations is 3⁄4 SM and for 20:1 penetrations 1  SM, which is discussed in chapter 5 of this handbook. When  there are penetrations of the final approach OIS, a visibility  credit for approach lighting systems is not allowed for  either airplane or helicopter procedures that would result

in values less than the appropriate 3⁄4 SM or 1 SM visibility  requirement. The 14 CFR Part 97.3 visibility reduction rule  does not apply, and you must take precautions to avoid  any obstacles in the visual segment. Procedures with  penetrations of the final approach OIS are annotated at the  next amendment with “Visibility Reduction by Helicopters  NA.”  

Until all the affected SIAPs have been annotated, an  understanding of how the standard visibilities are  established is the best aid in determining if penetrations  of the final approach OIS exists. Some of the variables in  determining visibilities are:  decision altitude (DA)/MDA  height above touchdown (HAT), height above airport  (HAA), distance of the facility to the MAP (or the runway  threshold for non- precision approaches), and approach  lighting configurations.  

The standard visibility requirement, without any credit  for lights, is 1 SM for non-precision approaches and 3⁄4  SM for precision approaches. This is based on a Category  A airplane 250–320 feet HAT/HAA; for non-precision  approaches a distance of 10,000 feet or less from the  facility to the MAP (or runway threshold). For precision  approaches, credit for any approach light configuration; for  non-precision approaches (with a 250 HAT) configured with  a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System (MALSR),  Simplified Short Approach Lighting System (SSALR), or  Approach Lighting System With Sequenced Flashing Lights  (ALSF)-1 normally results in a published visibility of 1⁄2 SM.  

Consequently, if an ILS is configured with approach lights  or a non-precision approach is configured with MALSR,  SSALR, or ALSF-1 lighting configurations and the procedure  has a published visibility of 3⁄4 SM or greater, a penetration  of the final approach OIS may exist. Also, pilots are unable  to determine whether there are penetrations of the final  approach OIS if a non-precision procedure does not have  approach lights or is configured with ODALS, MALS, or  SSALS/SALS lighting since the minimum published visibility  is 3⁄4 SM or greater.  

As a rule of thumb, approaches with published visibilities of  3⁄4 SM or more should be regarded as having final approach  OIS penetrations and care must be taken to avoid any  obstacles in the visual segment.  

Approaches with published visibilities of 1⁄2 SM or less are  free of OIS penetrations and the visibility reduction in Part  97.3 is authorized.  

# Copter Only Approaches to An Airport or  Heliport  

Pilots flying Copter   $\mathsf{S I A P S},$   other than GPS, may use the  published minima with no reductions in visibility allowed.  The maximum airspeed is 90 KIAS on any segment of the  approach or missed approach. Figure 7-10 illustrates the  COPTER ILS or LOC RWY 13 approach at NewYork/La Guardia  (LGA) airport.  

Copter ILS approaches to Category (CAT) I facilities with  DAs no lower than a 200-foot HAT provide an advantage  over a conventional ILS of shorter final segments and lower  minimums (based on the 20:1 missed approach surface).  There are also Copter approaches with minimums as low as  100-foot HAT and 1⁄4 SM visibility. Approaches with a HAT  below 200 feet are annotated with the note:    “Special Aircrew  & Aircraft Certification Required” since the FAA must approve  the helicopter and its avionics, and the flight crew must have  the required experience, training, and checking.  

The ground facilities (approach lighting, signal in space, hold  lines, maintenance, etc.) and air traffic infrastructure for CAT  II ILS approaches are required to support these procedures.  The helicopter must be equipped with an AP, FD, or head  up guidance system, alternate static source (or heated static  source), and radio altimeter. The pilot must have at least a  private pilot helicopter certificate, an instrument helicopter  rating, and a type rating if the helicopter requires a type  rating. Pilot experience requires the following flight times:  250 pilot in command (PIC), 100 helicopter PIC, 50 night  PIC, 75 hours of actual or simulated instrument flight time,  including at least 25 hours of actual or simulated instrument  flight time in a helicopter or a helicopter flight simulator, and  the appropriate recent experience, training and check. For  Copter CAT II ILS operations below 200 feet HAT, approach  deviations are limited to 1⁄4  scale of the localizer or glide  slope needle. Deviations beyond that require an immediate  missed approach unless the pilot has at least one of the visual  references in sight and otherwise meets the requirements of  14 CFR Part 91.175(c). The reward for this effort is the ability  to fly Copter ILS approaches with minima that are sometimes  below the airplane CAT II minima. The procedure to apply for  this certification is available from your local Flight Standards  District Office (FSDO).  

# Copter GPS Approaches to an Airport or  Heliport  

Pilots flying Copter GPS or WAAS SIAPs must limit the speed  to 90 KIAS on the initial and intermediate segment of the  approach and to no more than 70 KIAS on the final and  missed approach segments. If annotated, holding may also  be limited to 90 KIAS to contain the helicopter within the  small airspace provided for helicopter holding patterns.  

![](images/c24022114920af8130e839f597d7269ba52c8bae5bbc4fd28d232ef32b04174a.jpg)  

![](images/04de7a67c581ee454f4b2f115cc3d913da0e9923d519dc610cb3925881caa68a.jpg)  

During testing for helicopter holding, the optimum  airspeed and leg length combination was determined to  be 90 KIAS with a 3 NM outbound leg length. Consideration  was given to the wind drift on the dead reckoning entry  leg at slower speeds, the turn radius at faster airspeeds,  and the ability of the helicopter in strong wind conditions  to intercept the inbound course prior to the holding fix.  The published minimums are to be used with no visibility  reductions allowed. Figure 7-11 is an example of a Copter  GPS PinS approach that allows the helicopter to fly VFR  from the MAP to the heliport.  

The final and missed approach protected airspace providing  obstacle and terrain avoidance is based on 70 KIAS, with  a maximum 10-knot tailwind component. It is absolutely  essential that pilots adhere to the 70 KIAS limitation  in procedures that include an immediate climbing  and turning missed approach. Exceeding the airspeed  restriction increases the turning radius significantly and  can cause the helicopter to leave the missed approach  protected airspace. This may result in controlled flight into  terrain (CFIT) or obstacles.  

If a helicopter has a   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$   greater than 70 knots, then  it is not capable of conducting this type of approach.  Similarly, if the autopilot in “go-around” mode climbs at a   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{Y I}}$    greater than 70 knots, then that mode cannot be used.  It is the responsibility of the pilot to determine compliance  with missed approach climb gradient requirements  when operating at speeds other than  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{Y}}$    or  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{Y I}}$  . Missed  approaches that specify an “IMMEDIATE CLIMBING TURN”  have no provision for a straight ahead climbing segment  before turning. A straight segment results in exceeding the  protected airspace limits.  

Protected obstacle clearance areas and surfaces for the  missed approach are established on the assumption that  the missed approach is initiated at the DA point and for  non-precision approaches no lower than the MDA at the  MAP (normally at the threshold of the approach end of  the runway). The pilot must begin the missed approach at  those points. Flying beyond either point before beginning  the missed approach results in flying below the protected  obstacle clearance surface (OCS) and can result in a collision  with an obstacle.  

The missed approach segment U.S. Standard for Terminal  Instrument Procedures (TERPS) criteria for all Copter  approaches take advantage of the helicopter’s climb  capabilities at slow airspeeds, resulting in high climb  gradients. [Figure 7-12] The OCS used to evaluate the  missed approach is a 20:1 inclined plane. This surface is  twice as steep for the helicopter as the OCS used to evaluate  the airplane missed approach segment. The helicopter  climb gradient is, therefore, required to be double that of  the airplane’s required missed approach climb gradient.  

A minimum climb gradient of at least 400 ft/NM is required  unless a higher gradient is published on the approach  chart (e.g., a helicopter with a ground speed of 70 knots  is required to climb at a rate of 467 fpm (467 fpm  $=70$   ${\mathsf{K I A S}}\times400$   feet per NM/60 seconds)). The advantage of  using the 20:1 OCS for the helicopter missed approach  

![](images/9f089ab7be3b990c88b8f578e58e9a4ce96659f63cc740c4f2d48279ca597d14.jpg)  

segment instead of the 40:1 OCS used for the airplane is  that obstacles that penetrate the 40:1 missed approach  segment may not have to be considered. The result is  the DA/MDA may be lower for helicopters than for other  aircraft. The minimum required climb gradient of 400 ft/  NM for the helicopter in a missed approach provides 96  feet of required obstacle clearance (ROC) for each NM of  flightpath.  

# Helicopter Approaches to VFR Heliports  

Helicopter approaches to VFR heliports are normally  developed either as public procedures to a PinS that may  serve more than one heliport or as a special procedure to  a specific VFR heliport that requires pilot training due to its  unique characteristics. These approaches can be developed  using very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR)  or automatic direction finder (ADF), but area navigation  (RNAV) using GPS is the most common system used today.  RNAV using the WAAS offers the most advantages because  it can provide lower approach minimums, narrower route  widths to support a network of approaches, and may  allow the heliport to be used as an alternate. A majority  of the special procedures to a specific VFR heliport are  developed in support of HAA operators and have a “Proceed  Visually” segment between the MAP and the heliport.  Public procedures are developed as a PinS approach with a  “Proceed VFR” segment between the MAP and the landing  area. These PinS “Proceed VFR” procedures specify a course  and distance from the MAP to the available heliports in the  area.  

# Approach to a PinS  

The note associated with these procedures is: “PROCEED  VFR FROM (NAMED MAP) OR CONDUCT THE SPECIFIED  MISSED APPROACH.” They may be developed as a special  or public procedure where the MAP is located more than 2  SM from the landing site, the turn from the final approach  to the visual segment is greater than 30 degrees, or the VFR  segment from the MAP to the landing site has obstructions  that require pilot actions to avoid them. Figure 7-13 is an  example of a public PinS approach that allows the pilot to  fly to one of four heliports after reaching the MAP .  

For Part 135 operations, pilots may not begin the instrument  approach unless the latest weather report indicates that the  weather conditions are at or above the authorized IFR or VFR  minimums as required by the class of airspace, operating rule  and/or OpSpecs, whichever is higher. Visual contact with the  landing site is not required; however, prior to the MAP , for  either Part 91 or 135 operators, the pilot must determine if  the flight visibility meets the basic VFR minimums required  by the class of airspace, operating rule and/or OpSpecs  (whichever is higher). The visibility is limited to no lower  than that published in the procedure until canceling IFR. If  VFR minimums do not exist, then the published MAP must  be executed. The pilot must contact air traffic control (ATC)  upon reaching the MAP , or as soon as practical after that, and  advise whether executing the missed approach or canceling  IFR and proceeding VFR.  

To proceed VFR in uncontrolled airspace, Part 135 operators  must observe minimum regulatory VFR conditions, but  under some conditions, such as provided for in 14 CFR  135.613 for HAA operators, specific weather minimums are  required when near the MAP and the heliport of intended  landing. These minimums apply regardless of whether the  approach is located on the plains of Oklahoma or in the  Colorado mountains. However, for heliports located farther  than 3 NM from the heliport, Part135 HAA operators are  held to an even higher standard and the minimums and  lighting conditions contained in Figure 7-15 apply to the  entire route. Mountainous terrain at night with low light  conditions requires a ceiling of 1,000 feet and either 3 SM or  5 SM visibility depending on whether it has been determined  as part of the operator’s local flying area.  

In Class B, C, D, and E surface area airspace, a SVFR clearance  may be obtained if SVFR minimums exist. On your flight plan,  give ATC a heads up about your intentions by entering the  following in the remarks section:  “Request SVFR clearance  after the MAP .”  

# Approach to a Specific VFR Heliport  

The note associated with these procedures is:  “PROCEED  VISUALLY FROM (NAMED MAP) OR CONDUCT THE  SPECIFIED MISSED APPROACH.” Due to their unique  characteristics, these approaches require training. They  are developed for hospitals, oil rigs, private heliports, etc.  As Specials, they require Flight Standards approval by a  Letter of Authorization (LOA) for Part 91 operators or by  OpSpecs for Part 135 operators. For public procedures, the  heliport associated with these procedures must be located  within 2 SM of the MAP, the visual segment between the  MAP and the heliport evaluated for obstacle hazards,  and the heliport must meet the appropriate VFR heliport  recommendations of AC 150/5390-2, Heliport Design.  

The PinS optimum location is 0.65 NM from the heliport.  This provides an adequate distance to decelerate and land  from an approach speed of 70 KIAS. Certain airframes may  be certified to fly at reduced   $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$  or below  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$   speeds  as a result of flight control design or adherence to AC  29-2, Certification of Transport Category Rotorcraft. In  these cases, an approach procedure stating the minimum

# Point-in-Space Approach Examples  EXAMPLE 1  

![Figure 7-15.  Point-in-space (PinS)  approach examples for Part 91 and Part 135 operations.  ](images/3bad5c012c9c48791e5df0953bc74911c58275e8c110e97d7afeb20233930067.jpg)  

certified airspeed or flight below  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{M I N I}}$   should be annotated  on the approach procedure. The distance also permits  optimal blending of obstacle clearance criteria with non- instrument heliport approach areas.  

The visibility minimum is based on the distance from the  MAP to the heliport, among other factors (e.g., height  above the heliport elevation when at the MAP MDA). The  pilot is required to acquire and maintain visual contact  with the heliport final approach and takeoff (FATO) area  at or prior to the MAP. Obstacle or terrain avoidance from  the MAP to the heliport is the responsibility of the pilot.  Pilots need to level off when reaching the MDA, which  may occur before arriving at the MAP, until reaching the  visual approach angle on the approach path to clear the  obstacles. If the required weather minimums do not exist,  then the published MAP must be executed at the MAP  because IFR obstruction clearance areas are not applied to  the visual segment of the approach and a missed approach  segment protection is not provided between the MAP  and the heliport. As soon as practicable after reaching  the MAP, the pilot advises ATC whether cancelling IFR and  proceeding visually or executing the missed approach.  

# Inadvertent IMC  

Whether it is a corporate or HAA operation, helicopter pilots  sometimes operate in challenging weather conditions. An  encounter with weather that does not permit continued  flight under VFR might occur when conditions do not allow  for the visual determination of a usable horizon (e.g., fog,  snow showers, or night operations over unlit surfaces such  as water). Flight in conditions of limited visual contrast  should be avoided since this can result in a loss of horizontal  or surface reference, and obstacles such as wires become  perceptually invisible. To prevent spatial disorientation, loss  of control (LOC) or CFIT, pilots should slow the helicopter to a  speed that provides a controlled deceleration in the distance  equal to the forward visibility. The pilot should look for terrain  that provides sufficient contrast to either continue the flight  or to make a precautionary landing. If spatial disorientation  occurs and a climb into IMC is not feasible due to fuel state,  icing conditions, equipment, etc., make every effort to land  the helicopter with a slight forward descent to prevent any  sideward or rearward motion.  

All helicopter pilots should receive training on avoidance  and recovery from inadvertent IMC with emphasis on  avoidance. An unplanned transition from VMC to IMC flight  is an emergency that involves a different set of pilot actions.  It requires the use of different navigation and operational  procedures, interaction with ATC, and crewmember resource  management (CRM). Consideration should be given to the  local flying area’s terrain, airspace, air traffic facilities, weather  (including seasonal affects such as icing and thunderstorms),  and available airfield/heliport approaches.  

Training should emphasize the identification of  circumstances conducive to inadvertent IMC and a  strategy to abandon continued VFR flight in deteriorating  conditions. This strategy should include a minimum  altitude/airspeed combination that provides for an off­ airport/heliport landing, diverting to better conditions,  or initiating an emergency transition to IFR. Pilots should  be able to readily identify the minimum initial altitude  and course in order to avoid CFIT. Current IFR en route  and approach charts for the route of flight are essential.  A GPS navigation receiver with a moving map provides  exceptional situational awareness for terrain and obstacle  avoidance.  

Training for an emergency transition to IFR should  include full and partial panel instrument flight, unusual  attitude recovery, ATC communications, and instrument  approaches. If an ILS is available and the helicopter is  equipped, an ILS approach should be made. Otherwise, if  the helicopter is equipped with an IFR approach-capable  GPS receiver with a current database, a GPS approach  should be made. If neither, an ILS or GPS procedure is  available use another instrument approach.  

Upon entering inadvertent IMC, priority must be given  to control of the helicopter. Keep it simple and take one  action at a time.  

A radio altimeter is a necessity for alerting the pilot  when inadvertently going below the minimum altitude.  Barometric altimeters are subject to inaccuracies that  become important in helicopter IFR operations, especially  in cold temperatures.  

# IFR Heliports  

AC 150/5390-2, Heliport Design, provides recommendations  for heliport design to support non-precision, approach with  vertical guidance (APV), and precision approaches to a  heliport. When a heliport does not meet the criteria of AC  150/5390-2, FAA Order 8260.42, United States Standard  for Helicopter Area Navigation (RNAV), requires that an  instrument approach be published as a Special procedure  with annotations that special aircrew qualifications are  required to fly the procedure. Currently, there are no  operational civil IFR heliports in the U.S., although the U.S.  military has some non-precision and precision approach  procedures to IFR heliports.  

•   Control. First use the wings on the attitude indicator  to level the helicopter. Maintain heading and  increase to climb power. Establish climb airspeed  at the best angle of climb but no slower than  $\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{MNN}}$  . 

 •   Climb. Climb straight ahead until your crosscheck is  established. Then make a turn only to avoid terrain  or objects. If an altitude has not been previously  established with ATC to climb to for inadvertent IMC,  then you should climb to an altitude that is at least  1,000 feet above the highest known object and that  allows for contacting ATC.  

•   Communicate. Attempt to contact ATC as soon as  the helicopter is stabilized in the climb and headed  away from danger. If the appropriate frequency is  not known, you should attempt to contact ATC on  either very high frequency (VHF) 121.5 or ultra high  frequency (UHF) 243.0. Initial information provided  to ATC should be your approximate location, that  inadvertent IMC has been encountered and an  emergency climb has been made, your altitude,  amount of flight time remaining (fuel state), and  number of persons on board. You should then  request a vector to either VFR weather conditions  or to the nearest suitable airport/heliport that  conditions will support a successful approach. If  unable to contact ATC and a transponder code  has not been previously established with ATC for  inadvertent IMC, change the transponder code to  7700.  

# Emergency Procedures  

# Introduction  

Changing weather conditions, air traffic control (ATC), aircraft, and pilots are variables that make instrument flying an  unpredictable and challenging operation. Safety of the flight depends on the pilot’s ability to manage these variables  while maintaining positive aircraft control and adequate situational awareness (SA). This appendix discusses recognition  and suggested remedies for emergency events related to un-forecasted, adverse weather, aircraft system malfunctions,  communication/navigation system malfunctions, loss of SA, and inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions  (IIMCs).  

# Emergencies  

An emergency can be either a distress or urgency condition as defined in the pilot/controller glossary. Distress is defined  as a condition of being threatened by serious and/or imminent danger and requiring immediate assistance. Urgency is  defined as a condition of being concerned about safety and requiring timely but not immediate assistance; a potential  distress condition.  

Pilots do not hesitate to declare an emergency when faced with distress conditions, such as fire, mechanical failure,  or structural damage. However, some are reluctant to report an urgency condition when encountering situations that  may not be immediately perilous but are potentially catastrophic. An aircraft is in an urgency condition the moment  that the pilot becomes doubtful about position, fuel endurance, weather, or any other condition that could adversely  affect flight safety. The time for a pilot to request assistance is when an urgent situation may, or has just occurred, not  after it has developed into a distress situation.  

The pilot in command (PIC) is responsible for crew, passengers, and operation of the aircraft at all times. Title 14 of the  Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91,  $\S\,91.3$   allows deviations from regulations during emergencies that allow  the PIC to make the best decision to ensure safety of all personnel during these contingencies. Also, by declaring an  emergency during flight, that aircraft becomes a priority to land safely. Pilots who become apprehensive for their safety  for any reason should request assistance immediately. Assistance is available in the form of radio, radar, direction finding  (DF) stations, and other aircraft.  

# Inadvertent Thunderstorm Encounter  

A pilot should always avoid intentionally flying through a thunderstorm of any intensity; however, certain conditions may  be present that could lead to an inadvertent thunderstorm encounter. For example, flying in areas where thunderstorms  are embedded in large cloud masses may make thunderstorm avoidance difficult, even when the aircraft is equipped  with thunderstorm detection equipment. Pilots must be prepared to deal with inadvertent thunderstorm penetration.  At the very least, a thunderstorm encounter subjects the aircraft to turbulence that could be severe. The pilot, as well  as the crew and any passengers, should tighten seat belts and shoulder harnesses and secure any loose items in the  cabin or flight deck.  

As with any emergency, the first order of business is to fly the aircraft. The pilot workload is high; therefore, increased  concentration is necessary to maintain an instrument scan. Once in a thunderstorm, it is better to maintain a course  straight through the thunderstorm rather than turning around. A straight course most likely gets the pilot out of the  hazard in the least amount of time, and turning maneuvers only increase structural stress on the aircraft.  

Reduce power to a setting that maintains a recommended turbulence penetration speed as described in the appropriate  aircraft operator’s manual, and try to minimize additional power adjustments. Concentrate on keeping the aircraft in  a level attitude while allowing airspeed and altitude to fluctuate. Similarly, if using autopilot, disengage altitude and  speed hold modes because they only increase the aircraft’s maneuvering, which increases structural stress.  

During a thunderstorm encounter, the potential for icing also exists. As soon as possible, if the aircraft is so equipped,  turn on anti-icing/deicing equipment. Icing can be rapid at any altitude, and may lead to power failure and/or loss of  airspeed indication. Lightning is also present in a thunderstorm and can temporarily blind the pilot. To reduce risk,  turn up flight deck lights to the highest intensity, concentrate on flight instruments, and resist the urge to look outside.  

# Inadvertent Icing Encounter  

Because icing is unpredictable, pilots may find themselves in icing conditions although they have done everything to  avoid the condition. To stay alert to this possibility while operating in visible moisture, pilots should monitor the outside  air temperature (OAT).  

Anti-icing/de-icing equipment is critical to safety of the flight. If anti-icing/de-icing equipment is not used before  sufficient ice has accumulated, it may not be able to remove all ice accumulation. Use of anti-icing/de-icing reduces  power availability; therefore, pilots should be familiar with the aircraft operator’s manual for use of anti-icing/de-icing  equipment.  

Before entering visible moisture with temperatures at five degrees above freezing or cooler, activate appropriate  anti-icing/de-icing equipment in anticipation of ice accumulation; early ice detection is critical. Detecting ice may be  particularly difficult during night flight. The pilot may need to use a flashlight to check for ice accumulation on the  wings, fuselage, landing gear, and horizontal stabilizer. At the first indication of ice accumulation, the pilot must act  to circumvent icing conditions. Options for action once ice has begun to accumulate on the aircraft are the following:  

•  Move to an altitude with significantly colder temperatures.  •  Move to an altitude with temperatures above freezing.  •  Fly to an area clear of visible moisture.  •  Change the heading, and fly to an area of known non-icing conditions.  

If these options are not available, consider an immediate landing at the nearest suitable airport. Anti-icing/de-icing  equipment does not allow aircraft to operate in icing conditions indefinitely; it only provides more time to evade icing  conditions. If icing is encountered, an aircraft controllability check should be considered in the landing configuration.  Give careful consideration to configuration changes that might produce unanticipated aircraft flight dynamics.  

# Precipitation Static  

Precipitation static occurs when accumulated static electricity discharges from extremities of the aircraft. This discharge  has the potential to create problems with the aircraft’s instruments. These problems range from serious, such as  complete loss of VHF communications and erroneous magnetic compass readings, to the annoyance of high-pitched  audio squealing.  

Precipitation static is caused when an aircraft encounters airborne particles during flight (rain or snow) and develops a  negative charge. It can also result from atmospheric electric fields in thunderstorm clouds. When a significant negative  voltage level is reached, the aircraft discharges it, creating electrical disturbances. To reduce problems associated with  precipitation static, the pilot ensures that the aircraft’s static wicks are maintained and accounted for. All broken or  missing static wicks should be replaced before an instrument flight.  

# Aircraft System Malfunction  

Preventing aircraft system malfunctions that might lead to an in-flight emergency begins with a thorough preflight  inspection. In addition to items normally checked before visual flight rules (VFR) flight, pilots intending to fly instrument  flight rules (IFR) should pay particular attention to antennas, static wicks, anti-icing/de-icing equipment, pitot tube, and  static ports. During taxi, verify operation and accuracy of all flight instruments. The pilots must ensure that all systems  are operational before departing into IFR conditions.  

# Generator Failure  

Depending on aircraft being flown, a generator failure is indicated in different ways. Some aircraft use an ammeter  that indicates the state of charge or discharge of the battery. A positive indication on the ammeter indicates a charge  condition; a negative indication reveals a discharge condition. Other aircraft use a load meter to indicate the load being  carried by the generator. If the generator fails, a zero load indication is shown on the load meter. Review the appropriate  aircraft operator’s manual for information on the type of systems installed in the aircraft.  

Once a generator failure is detected, the pilot must reduce electrical load on the battery and land as soon as practical.  Depending on electrical load and condition of the battery, sufficient power may be available for an hour or more of  flight or for only a matter of minutes. The pilot must be familiar with systems requiring electricity to run and which  continue to operate without power. In aircraft with multiple generators, care should be taken to reduce electrical load  to avoid overloading the operating generator(s).  The pilot can attempt to troubleshoot generator failure by following  established procedures published in the appropriate aircraft operator’s manual. If the generator cannot be reset, inform  ATC of an impending electrical failure.  

# Instrument Failure  

System or instrument failure is usually identified by a warning indicator or an inconsistency between indications on  the attitude indicator, supporting performance instruments, and instruments at the other pilot station, if so equipped.  Aircraft control must be maintained while the pilot identifies the failed components and expedite cross-check including  all flight instruments. The problem may be individual instrument failure or a system failure affecting several instruments.  

One method of identification involves an immediate comparison of the attitude indicator with rate-of-turn indicator  and vertical speed indicator (VSI). Along with providing pitch-and-bank information, this technique compares the static  system with the pressure system and electrical system. Identify the failed components and use remaining functional  instruments to maintain aircraft control. Attempt to restore inoperative components by checking the appropriate power  source, changing to a backup or alternate system, and resetting the instrument if possible. Covering failed instruments  may enhance the ability to maintain aircraft control and navigate the aircraft. ATC should be notified of the problem  and, if necessary, declare an emergency before the situation deteriorates beyond the ability to recover.  

# Pitot/Static System Failure  

A pitot or static system failure can also cause erratic and unreliable instrument indications. When a static system  problem occurs, it affects the airspeed indicator, altimeter, and VSI. In the absence of an alternate static source in an  unpressurized aircraft, the pilot could break the glass on the VSI because it is not required for instrument flight. Breaking  the glass provides both the altimeter and airspeed indicator a source of static pressure, but pilots should be cautious  because breaking the glass can cause additional instrument errors. Before considering, pilots should be familiar with  their aircraft’s specific procedures for static problems.  

# Loss of Situational Awareness (SA)  

SA is an overall assessment of environmental elements and how they affect flight. SA permits the pilot to make decisions  ahead of time and allows evaluation of several different options. Conversely, a pilot who is missing important information  about the flight is apt to make reactive decisions. Poor SA means that the pilot lacks vision regarding future events  that can force him or her to make decisions quickly often with limited options. During an IFR flight, pilots operate at  varying levels of SA. For example, a pilot may be en route to a destination with a high level of SA when ATC issues an  unexpected standard terminal arrival route (STAR). Because the STAR is unexpected and the pilot is unfamiliar with the  procedure, SA is reduced. However, after becoming familiar with the STAR and resuming normal navigation, the pilot  returns to a higher level of SA.  

Factors reducing SA include distractions, unusual or unexpected events, complacency, high workload, unfamiliar  situations, and inoperative equipment. In some situations, a loss of SA may be beyond a pilot’s control. With an electrical  system failure and associated loss of an attitude indication, a pilot may find the aircraft in an unusual attitude. In this  situation, established procedures are used to regain SA and aircraft control. Pilots must be alert to loss of SA especially  when hampered by a reactive mindset. To regain SA, reassess the situation and work toward understanding what the  problem is. The pilot may need to seek additional information from other sources, such as navigation instruments, other  crewmembers, or ATC.  

# Inadvertent Instrument Meteorological Condition (IIMC)  

Some pilots have the misconception that inadvertent instrument meteorological condition (IIMC) does not apply to an IFR  flight. The following examples could cause a pilot to inadvertently encounter IMC.  

1.  The aircraft has entered visual meteorological conditions (VMC) during an instrument approach procedure       (IAP) and while circling to land encounters IMC.  2.  During a non-precision IAP, the aircraft, in VMC, levels at the MDA just below the overcast. Suddenly, the         aircraft re-enters the overcast because either the pilot was unable to correctly hold his or her altitude and           climbed back into the overcast, or the overcast sloped downward ahead of the aircraft and, while maintaining      the correct MDA, the aircraft re-entered the clouds.  3. After inadvertently re-entering the clouds, the pilot maintains aircraft control, and then maneuvers to the        published holding fix, while contacting ATC.  If navigational guidance or pilot SA were lost, the pilot would       then climb to the published MSA (see AIM paragraph 5-4-7c).  

In order to survive an encounter with IIMC, a pilot must recognize and accept the seriousness of the situation. The pilot  will need to immediately commit to the instruments and perform the proper recovery procedures.  

# Maintaining  Aircraft Control  

Once the crewmembers recognize the situation, they commit to controlling the aircraft by using and trusting flight  instruments. Attempting to search outside the flight deck for visual confirmation can result in spatial disorientation  and complete loss of control. The crew must rely on instruments and depend on crew coordination to facilitate that  transition. The pilot or flight crew must abandon their efforts to establish visual references and fly the aircraft by their  flight instruments.  

The most important concern, along with maintaining aircraft control, is to initiate a climb immediately. An immediate  climb provides a greater separation from natural and manmade obstacles, as well as improve radar reception of the  aircraft by ATC. An immediate climb should be appropriate for the current conditions, environment, and known or  perceived obstacles. Listed below are procedures that can assist in maintaining aircraft control after encountering IIMC  with the most critical action being to immediately announce IIMC and begin a substantial climb while procedures are  being performed. These procedures are performed nearly simultaneously:  

•   Attitude—level wings on the attitude indicator.  •   Heading—maintain heading; turn only to avoid known obstacles.  •   Power—adjust power as necessary for desired climb rate.  •   Airspeed—adjust airspeed as necessary.  Complete the IIMC recovery according to local and published   regulations and policies.  

In situations where the pilot encounters IIMC while conducting an instrument maneuver, the best remedy is immediate  execution of the published missed approach.  

The pilot must trust the flight instruments concerning the aircraft’s attitude regardless of intuition or visual interpretation.  The vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) can confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, sensory areas of the  inner ear cannot detect slight changes in aircraft attitude nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at  a uniform rate over time. Conversely, false sensations often push the pilot to believe that the attitude of the aircraft has  changed when in fact it has not, resulting in spatial disorientation.  

# ATC Requirements During an In-Flight Emergency  

ATC personnel can help pilots during in-flight emergency situations. Pilots should understand the services provided  by ATC and the resources and options available. These services enable pilots to focus on aircraft control and help them  make better decisions in a time of stress.  

# Provide Information  

During emergency situations, pilots should provide as much information as possible to ATC. ATC uses the information to  determine what kind of assistance it can provide with available assets and capabilities. Information requirements vary  depending on the existing situation. ATC requires at a minimum, the following information for in-flight emergencies:  

•  Aircraft identification and type  •  Nature of the emergency  •  Pilot’s desires  

If time and the situation permits, the pilot should provide ATC with more information. Listed below is additional  information that would help ATC in further assisting the pilot during an emergency situation.  

•  Aircraft altitude  •  Point of departure and destination  •  Airspeed  •  Fuel remaining in time  •  Heading since last known position  •  Visible landmarks  •  Navigational aids (NAVAID) signals received  •  Time and place of last known position  •  Aircraft color  •  Pilot reported weather  •  Emergency equipment on board  •  Number of people on board  •  Pilot capability for IFR flight  •  Navigation equipment capability  

When the pilot requests, or when deemed necessary, ATC can enlist services of available radar facilities and DF facilities  operated by the FAA. ATC can also coordinate with other agencies, such as the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and other local  authorities and request their emergency services.  

# Radar Assistance  

Radar is an invaluable asset that can be used by pilots during emergencies. With radar, ATC can provide navigation  assistance to aircraft and provide last-known location during catastrophic emergencies. If a VFR aircraft encounters or  is about to encounter IMC weather conditions, the pilot can request radar vectors to VFR airports or VFR conditions. If  the pilot determines that he or she is qualified and the aircraft is capable of conducting IFR flight, the pilot should file  an IFR flight plan and request a clearance from ATC to the destination airport as appropriate. If the aircraft has already  encountered IFR conditions, ATC can inform the pilot of appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude. If the  aircraft is below appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude and sufficiently accurate position information  has been received or radar identification is established, ATC can furnish a heading or radial on which to climb to reach  appropriate terrain/ obstacle clearance minimum altitude.  

# Emergency Airports  

ATC personnel consider how much remaining fuel in relation to the distance to the airport and weather conditions  when recommending an emergency airport to aircraft requiring assistance.  Depending on the nature of the emergency,  certain weather phenomena may deserve weighted consideration.  A pilot may elect to fly further to land at an airport  with VFR conditions instead of closer airfield with IFR conditions. Other considerations are airport conditions, NAVAID  status, aircraft type, pilot’s qualifications, and vectoring or homing capability to the emergency airport. In addition,  ATC and pilots should determine which guidance can be used to fly to the emergency airport. The following options  may be available:  

•   Radar  •   DF  •   Following another aircraft  •   NAVAIDs  •   Pilotage by landmarks  •   Compass headings  

# Emergency Obstruction Video Map (EOVM)  

The emergency obstruction video map (EOVM) is intended to facilitate advisory service in an emergency situation when  appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude cannot be maintained. The EOVM, and the service provided,  are used only under the following conditions:  

1.  The pilot has declared an emergency.  2.  The controller has determined an emergency condition exists or is imminent because of the pilots inability to  maintain an appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitude.  

Note:  Appropriate terrain/obstacle clearance minimum altitudes may be defined as minimum IFR altitude (MIA), minimum  en route altitude (MEA), minimum obstacle clearance altitude (MOCA), or minimum vectoring altitude (MVA).  

When providing emergency vectoring service, the controller advises the pilot that any headings issued are emergency  advisories intended only to direct the aircraft toward and over an area of lower terrain/obstacle elevation. Altitudes and  obstructions depicted on the EOVM are actual altitudes and locations of the obstacle/terrain and contain no lateral or  vertical buffers for obstruction clearance.  

# Responsibility  

ATC, in communication with an aircraft in distress, should handle the emergency and coordinate and direct the activities  of assisting facilities. ATC will not transfer this responsibility to another facility unless that facility can better handle the  situation. When an ATC facility receives information about an aircraft in distress, they forward detailed data to the center  in the area of the emergency. Centers serve as central points for collecting information, coordinating with search and  rescue (SAR) and distributing information to appropriate agencies.  

Although 121.5 megahertz and 243.0 megahertz are emergency frequencies, the pilot should keep the aircraft on the  initial contact frequency. The pilot should change frequencies only when a valid reason exists. When necessary, and  if weather and circumstances permit, ATC should recommend that aircraft maintain or increase altitude to improve  communications, radar, or DF reception.  

# Escort  

An escort aircraft, if available, should consider and evaluate an appropriate formation. Special consideration must be  given if maneuvers take the aircraft through clouds. Aircraft should not execute an in-flight join up during emergency  conditions unless both crews involved are familiar with and capable of formation flight and can communicate and have  visual contact with each other.

Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS) . The AWSS  is part of the Aviation Surface Weather Observation Network  suite of programs and provides pilots and other users  with weather information through the Automated Surface  Observing System. The AWSS sensor suite automatically  collects, measures, processes, and broadcasts surface  weather data.  

Automated Weather System . Any of the automated  weather sensor platforms that collect weather data at  airports and disseminate the weather information via  radio and/or landline. The systems currently consist of the  Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Automated  Weather Sensor System (AWSS), and Automated Weather  Observation System (AWOS).  

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) .  A surveillance system that continuously broadcasts GPS  position information, aircraft identification, altitude,  velocity vector, and direction to all other aircraft and air  traffic control facilities within a specific area. Automatic  dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) information  is displayed in the flight deck via a flight deck display of  traffic information (CDTI) unit, providing the pilot with  greater situational awareness. ADS-B transmissions also  provides controllers with a more complete picture of traffic  and updates that information more frequently than other  surveillance equipment.

Changeover Point (COP) . A COP indicates the point where  a frequency change is necessary between navigation aids,  when other than the midpoint on an airway, to receive  course guidance from the facility ahead of the aircraft  instead of the one behind. These COPs divide an airway  or route segment and ensure continuous reception of  navigational signals at the prescribed minimum en route  IFR altitude.  

Chart Supplement (CS or d-CS for digital Chart Supplement).  Regional booklets published by Aeronautical Information  Services that provides general information (graphic and  textual) about all airports, both VFR and IFR (in the A/FD  section),  Notices, Associated Data and Airport Diagrams.  The A/FD section includes runway length and width,  runway surface, load bearing capacity, runway slope,  airport services, and hazards such as birds and reduced  visibility.  

Charted Visual Flight Procedure (CVFP) . A CVFP may be  established at some towered airports for environmental  or noise considerations, as well as when necessary for the  safety and efficiency of air traffic operations. Designed  primarily for turbojet aircraft, CVFPs depict prominent  landmarks, courses, and recommended altitudes to specific  runways.  

Closely Spaced Dependent Approaches.  Identifies  dependent approaches to parallel runways spaced less  than 2,500 feet apart where ATC is permitted to apply  reduced diagonal separation and special wake turbulence  procedures. turbulence procedures.  

Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) . The display  and user interface for information about air traffic within  approximately 80 miles. It typically combines and shows  traffic data from TCAS, TIS-B, and ADS-B. Depending on  features, the display may also show terrain, weather, and  navigation information.  

Collision Hazard . A condition, event, or circumstance  that could induce an occurrence of a collision or surface  accident or incident.  

Columns . See database columns.  

Contact Approach . An approach where an aircraft on an  IFR flight plan, having an air traffic control authorization,  operating clear of clouds with at least one mile flight  visibility, and a reasonable expectation of continuing to  the destination airport in those conditions, may deviate  from the instrument approach procedure and proceed to  the destination airport by visual reference to the surface.  This approach is only authorized when requested by the  pilot and the reported ground visibility at the destination  airport is at least one statute mile.  

Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) . A situation where a  mechanically normally functioning aircraft is inadvertently  flown into the ground, water, or an obstacle. There are  two basic causes of CFIT accidents; both involve flight  crew situational awareness. One definition of situational  awareness is an accurate perception by pilots of the factors  and conditions currently affecting the safe operation of the  aircraft and the crew. The causes of CFIT are the flight crews’  lack of vertical position awareness or their lack of horizontal  position awareness in relation to terrain and obstacles.  

Database Columns . The spaces for data entry on each  record. One column can accommodate one character.  

Database Field . The collection of characters needed to  define one item of information.  

Database Identifier . A specific geographic point in space  identified on an aeronautical chart and in a naviation  database, officially designated by the controlling state  authority or derived by Jeppesen. It has no ATC function  and should not be used in filing flight plans nor used when  communicating with ATC.  

Database Record . A single line of computer data made up  of the fields necessary to define fully a single useful piece  of data.  

Decision Altitude (DA) . A specified altitude in the precision  approach at which a missed approach must be initiated  if the required visual reference to continue the approach  has not been established. The term “Decision Altitude  $(\mathsf{D A})^{\prime\prime}$      is referenced to mean sea level and the term “Decision  Height  $(\mathsf{D}\mathsf{H})^{\prime\prime}$   is referenced to the threshold elevation. Even  though DH is charted as an altitude above MSL, the U.S.  has adopted the term“DA” as a step toward harmonization  of the United States and international terminology. At  some point, DA will be published for all future instrument  approach procedures with vertical guidance.  

Decision Height (DH) . See Decision Altitude.  

Departure End of Runway (DER) . The end of runway  available for the ground run of an aircraft departure. The  end of the runway that is opposite the landing threshold,  sometimes referred to as the stop end of the runway.  Altitude, velocity vector, and direction to all other aircraft  and air traffic control facilities within a specific area.  Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B)  information is displayed in the flight deck via a cockpit  display of traffic information (CDTI) unit, providing the pilot  with greater situational awareness. ADS-B transmissions  also provide controllers with a more complete picture of  traffic and update that information more frequently than  other surveillance equipment.  

Descend Via . A descend via clearance instructs you to follow  the altitudes published on a STAR. You are not authorized to  leave your last assigned altitude unless specifically cleared  to do so. If ATC amends the altitude or route to one that  is different from the published procedure, the rest of the  charted descent procedure is canceled. ATC will assign  you any further route, altitude, or airspeed clearances, as  necessary.  

Digital ATIS (D-ATIS) . An alternative method of receiving  ATIS reports by aircraft equipped with datalink services  capable of receiving information in the flight deck over  their Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting  System (ACARS) unit.  

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) . A digital representation of  ground surface topography or terrain.

An airport may establish a  diverse vector area if it is necessary to vector aircraft below  the minimum vectoring altitude to assist in the efficient  flow of departing traffic. DVA design requirements are  outlined in FAA Order 8260.3 and allow for the vectoring  of aircraft immediately off the departure end of the runway  below the MVA.  

Dynamic Magnetic Variation . A field that is simply a  computer model calculated value instead of a measured  value contained in the record for a waypoint.  

EFVS Operation.  An operation in which visibility conditions  require an EFVS to be used in lieu of natural vision to  perform an approach or landing, determine enhanced  flight visibility, identify required visual references, or  conduct a rollout.  

Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) . An electronic display system  intended primarily for flight deck or cabin use. EFB devices  can display a variety of aviation data or perform basic  calculations (e.g., performance data, fuel calculations, etc.).  In the past, some of these functions were traditionally  accomplished using paper references or were based on  data provided to the flight crew by an airline’s flight dispatch  function.The scope of the EFB system functionality may also  include various other hosted databases and applications.  Physical EFB displays may use various technologies,  formats, and forms of communication. These devices are  sometimes referred to as auxiliary performance computers  (APC) or laptop auxiliary performance computers (LAPC).  

Ellipsoid of Revolution . The surface that results when an  ellipse is rotated about one of its axes.

Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) .  A set of standards that require aircraft to have a minimum  navigation performance capability in order to operate in  MNPS designated airspace. In addition, aircraft must be  certified by their State of Registry for MNPS operation.  Under certain conditions, non-MNPS aircraft can operate  in MNPS airspace, however, standard oceanic separation  minima is provided between the non-MNPS aircraft and  other traffic.  

Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA) . The  MOCA is the lowest published altitude in effect between  radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route  segments that meets obstacle clearance requirements  for the entire route segment. This altitude also assures  acceptable navigational signal coverage only within 22  NM of a VOR.  

Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA) . An MRA is determined  by FAA flight inspection traversing an entire route of flight  to establish the minimum altitude the navigation signal can  be received for the route and for off-course NAVAID facilities  that determine a fix. When the MRA at the fix is higher than  the MEA, an MRA is established for the fix, and is the lowest  altitude at which an intersection can be determined.  

Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) . MSAs are published for  emergency use on IAP charts. For conventional navigation  systems, the MSA is normally based on the primary  omnidirectional facility on which the IAP is predicated.

In fact, the primary emphasis  of ODP design is to use the least erroneous route of flight to  the en route structure while attempting to accommodate  typical departure routes.  

Obstacle Identification Surface (OIS) . The design of a  departure procedure is based on FAA Order 8260.3, a living  document that is updated frequently. Departure design  criteria assumes an initial climb of 200 Ft/NM after crossing  the departure end of the runway (DER) at a height of at  least 35 feet above the ground. Assuming a 200 Ft/NM  climb, the departure is structured to provide at least 48 Ft/  NM of clearance above objects that do not penetrate the  obstacle slope. The slope, known as the OIS, is based on a  40 to 1 ratio, which is the equivalent of a 152 Ft/NM slope.

Pilots cleared to “fly or  maintain runway heading” are expected to fly or maintain  the published heading that corresponds with the extended  centerline of the departure runway (until otherwise  instructed by ATC), and are not to apply drift correction  (e.g., RWY 4, actual magnetic heading of the runway  centerline  $044.22^{\circ},$  , fly  $044^{\circ})$  ).  

Record . See Database Record.  

Runway Hotspots . Locations on a particular airport that  historically have hazardous intersections. Hot spots alert  pilots to the fact that there may be a lack of visibility at  certain points or the tower may be unable to see that  particular intersection.

Standard Service Volume . Most air navigation radio aids  that provide positive course guidance have a designated  standard service volume (SSV). The SSV defines the  reception limits of unrestricted NAVAIDS that are usable for  random/unpublished route navigation. Standard service  volume limitations do not apply to published IFR routes or  procedures. See the AIM (Chapter 1) for the SSV for specific  NAVAID types.  

Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) . Provides a common  method for departing the en route structure and navigating  to your destination. A STAR is a preplanned instrument  flight rule ATC arrival procedure published for pilot use  in graphic and textual form to simplify clearance delivery  procedures. STARs provide you with a transition from  the en route structure to an outer fix or an instrument  approach fix or arrival waypoint in the terminal area. STARs  usually terminate with an instrument or visual approach  procedure, but may also terminate with a heading or course  to fly for radar vectors.

They are newly established, unpublished  airspace fixes that are designated geographic locations/  positions that help provide positive course guidance for  navigation and a means of checking progress on a flight.  They may or may not be actually plotted by the pilot on  en route charts, but would normally be communicated to  ATC in terms of bearing and distance or latitude/longitude.  An example of user-defined waypoints typically includes  those derived from database-driven area navigation (RNAV)  systems whereby latitude/longitude coordinate-based  waypoints are generated by various means including  keyboard input, and even electronic map mode functions  used to establish waypoints with a cursor on the display.  

Another example is an offset phantom waypoint, which  is a point in space formed by a bearing and distance from  NAVAIDs, such as VORs, VORTACs, and TACANs, using a  variety of navigation systems.  

User Request Evaluation Tool (URET) . The URET helps  provide enhanced, automated flight data management.  URET is an automated tool provided at each radar position  in selected en route facilities. It uses flight and radar data  to determine present and future trajectories for all active  and proposed aircraft flights. A graphic plan display  depicts aircraft, traffic, and notification of predicted  conflicts. Graphic routes for current plans and trial plans  are displayed upon controller request. URET can generate  a predicted conflict of two aircraft, or between aircraft  and airspace.  

Vertical Navigation (VNAV) . Traditionally, the only way  to get glidepath information during an approach was to  use a ground-based NAVAID, but modern area navigation  systems allow flight crews to display an internally  generated descent path that allows a constant rate descent  to minimums during approaches that would otherwise  include multiple level-offs.  

Vertical Navigation Planning . Included within certain STARs  is information provided to help you reduce the amount of  low altitude flying time for high performance aircraft, like  jets and turboprops. An expected altitude is given for a key  fix along the route. By knowing an intermediate altitude in  advance when flying a high performance aircraft, you can  plan the power or thrust settings and aircraft configurations  that result in the most efficient descent, in terms of time,  fuel requirements, and engine wear.  

Visual Approach . A visual approach is an ATC authorization  for an aircraft on an IFR flight plan to proceed visually to  the airport of intended landing; it is not an IAP. Also, there  is no missed approach segment. When it is operationally  beneficial, ATC may authorize pilots to conduct a visual  approach to the airport in lieu of the published IAP. A visual  approach can be initiated by a pilot or the controller.
