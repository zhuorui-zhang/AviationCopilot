# Preface  

The Airplane Flying Handbook provides basic knowledge that is essential for pilots. This handbook introduces basic pilot  skills and knowledge that are essential for piloting airplanes. It provides information on transition to other airplanes and the  operation of various airplane systems. It is developed by the Flight Standards Service, Airman Testing Standards Branch,  in cooperation with various aviation educators and industry. This handbook is developed to assist student pilots learning  to fly airplanes. It is also beneficial to pilots who wish to improve their flying proficiency and aeronautical knowledge,  those pilots preparing for additional certificates or ratings, and flight instructors engaged in the instruction of both student  and certificated pilots. It introduces the future pilot to the realm of flight and provides information and guidance in the  performance of procedures and maneuvers required for pilot certification.  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of 14 CFR and the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). The AIM is available online at  www.faa.gov . The current Flight Standards Service  airman training and testing material can be obtained from  www.faa.gov .  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-3B, Airplane Flying Handbook, dated 2016.  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from  www.faa.gov

# Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Major Revisions  

•   Removed mandatory language or cited applicable regulations throughout handbook.  

•   Chapter 1 (Introduction to Flight Training) – Added information on the FAA Wings Program.  

•   Chapter 2 (Ground Operations) – Added a new graphic and information regarding detonation. Now uses  the same marshalling graphic as the AMT General Handbook. Updated material on hand propping to  match the material in the AMT General Handbook (it doesn’t matter whether a pilot or mechanic is hand  propping).  

•   Chapter 3 (Basic Flight Maneuvers) – Corrected G1000 and indications of slip and skid graphics.  

•   Chapter 4 (Energy Management) – All new chapter/material. Incremented the existing chapters 4-17 by 1  (now there are 18 chapters in total).  

•   Chapter 5 (Maintaining Aircraft Control) – Revised the order in which the material was presented.  

•   Chapter 7 (Ground Reference Maneuvers) – Corrected errors in text and graphics for eights on pylons.  

•   Chapter 9 (Approaches and Landings) – Added information concerning a forward slip to a landing and  corrected Figure 9-6. Changed description associated with Crosswind Final Approach. Removed  material on 360 degree power-off landing as this maneuver is not part of testing standard.  

•   Chapter 10 (Performance Maneuvers) – Added information on lazy eights.  

•   Chapter 11 (Night Operations) – Revised to align with material from CAMI.  

•   Chapter 13 (Transition to Multiengine Airplanes) – Incorporated the addendum. Corrected G1000  displays and force vectors on figures. Accelerated approach to stall minimum altitude revised to match  the ACS. The 14 CFR part 23 certification standard used for many multiengine airplanes is now referred  to a historical standard, since many of the previous requirements will not apply to newly certificated  aircraft.  

•   Chapter 14 (Transition to Tailwheel Airplanes) – Made minor revision regarding handling characteristics.  

•   Chapter 15 (Transition to Turboprop eller-Powered Airplanes ) – Addressed an NTSB recommendation  regarding slow spool up time of split-shaft engines and corrected figure of fixed-shaft engine gauges.  

•   Chapter 16 (Transition to  J et -Powered  Airplanes) – Removed extra information that appears unrelated to  flying a turbojet and added information regarding energy management and distance versus altitude in a  descent.  

•   Chapter 18 (Emergency Procedures) – Revised information regarding the safety of turning back after an  engine failure after takeoff. Added a section on emergency response systems to include ballistic  parachutes and autoland systems. Corrected figures of G1000 displays.

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 1: Introduction to Flight Training  

# Introduction  

The overall purpose of primary and intermediate flight training, as outlined in this handbook, is the acquisition and honing of basic  airmanship skills.  [Figure 1-1]  Airmanship is a broad term that includes a sound knowledge of and experience with the principles of  flight; the knowledge, experience, and ability to operate an aircraft with competence and precision both on the ground and in the air;  and the application of sound judgment that results in optimal operational safety and efficiency.  [Figure   $_{I-2J}$  Learning to fly an  aircraft has often been compared to learning to drive an automobile. This analogy is misleading. Since aircraft operate in a three- dimensional environment, they require a depth of knowledge and type of motor skill development that is more sensitive to this  situation, such as:  

⦁  Coordination – the ability to use the hands and feet together subconsciously and in the proper relationship       to produce desired results in the airplane.  

⦁  Timing – the application of muscular coordination at the proper instant to make flight, and all maneuvers, a      constant, smooth process.  

⦁  Control touch – the ability to sense the action of the airplane and knowledge to determine its probable      actions immediately regarding attitude and speed variations by sensing the varying pressures and resistance      of the control surfaces transmitted through the flight controls.  

⦁  Speed sense – the ability to sense and react to reasonable variations of airspeed.

Figure 1-1.  Primary and intermediate flight training teaches basic airmanship skills and creates a good foundation for learners.  

An accomplished pilot demonstrates the knowledge and ability to:  

⦁  Assess a situation quickly and accurately and determine the correct procedure to be followed under the      existing circumstance.  ⦁  Predict the probable results of a given set of circumstances or of a proposed procedure.  ⦁  Exercise care and due regard for safety.  ⦁  Accurately gauge the performance of the aircraft.  ⦁  Recognize personal limitations and limitations of the aircraft and avoid exceeding them.  ⦁  Identify, assess, and mitigate risk on an ongoing basis.

Figure 1-2.  Good airmanship skills include sound knowledge of the principles of flight and the ability to operate an airplane with  competence and precision.  

The development of airmanship skills depends upon effort and dedication on the part of both the learner and the flight instructor,  beginning with the very first training flight where proper habit formation begins with the learner being introduced to good operating  practices.  

Every airplane has its own particular flight characteristics. The purpose of primary and intermediate flight training, however, is not to  learn how to fly a particular make and model airplane. The purpose of flight training is to develop the knowledge, experience, skills,  and safe habits that establish a foundation and are transferable to any airplane. The pilot who has acquired necessary skills during  training, and develops these skills by flying training-type airplanes with precision and safe flying habits, is able to easily transition to  more complex and higher performance airplanes. Also note that the goal of flight training is a safe and competent pilot; passing  required practical tests for pilot certification is only incidental to this goal.  

# Role of the FAA  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is empowered by the U.S. Congress to promote aviation safety by prescribing safety  standards for civil aviation. Standards are established for the certification of airmen and aircraft, as well as outlining operating rules.  This is accomplished through the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), formerly referred to as Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).  Title 14 of the CFR (14 CFR) is titled Aeronautics and Space with Chapter 1 dedicated to the FAA. Subchapters are broken down by  category with numbered parts detailing specific information.  [Figure 1-3]  For ease of reference and since the parts are numerical, the  abbreviated pattern 14 CFR part ___ is used (e.g., 14 CFR part 91).  

This guidance is not legally binding in its own right and will not be relied upon by the FAA as a separate basis for affirmative  enforcement action or other administrative penalty. Conformity with the guidance is voluntary only and nonconformity will not affect  rights and obligations under existing statutes and regulations.  

While the various subchapters and parts of 14 CFR provide general to specific guidance regarding aviation operations within the  U.S., the topic of aircraft certification and airworthiness is spread through several interconnected parts of 14 CFR.  

![](images/6da69078a3a918e0ce469cec293afc7b6cbaf72d9b1d93e26d49701501efedab.jpg)  
Figure 1-3.  Title 14 CFR, Chapter 1, Aeronautics and Space and subchapters.  

⦁  14 CFR part 21 prescribes procedural requirements for issuing airworthiness certificates and 

     airworthiness approvals for aircraft and aircraft parts. A standard airworthiness certificate, FAA Form 

     8100-2  [Figure 1-4] , is required to be displayed in the aircraft in accordance with 14 CFR part 91, 

     section 91.203(b). It is issued for aircraft type certificated in the normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter or 

     transport category, and for manned free balloons. A standard airworthiness certificate remains valid as long 

     as the aircraft meets its approved type design, is in a condition for safe operation and maintenance, and 

     preventative maintenance and alterations are performed in accordance with 14 CFR parts 21, 43, and 91.  

⦁  14 CFR part 39 is the authority for the FAA to issue Airworthiness Directives (ADs) when an unsafe  condition exists in a product, aircraft, or part, and the condition is likely to exist or develop in other  products of the same type design.  

⦁  14 CFR part  43 prescribes rules governing the maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding, and   alteration of any aircraft having a U.S. airworthiness certificate. It also applies to the airframe,  aircraft engines, propellers, appliances, and component parts of such aircraft.  

⦁  14 CFR part  45 identifies the requirements for the identification of aircraft, engines, propellers, certain   replacement and modification parts, and the nationality and registration marking required on U.S.- registered aircraft.   ⦁  14 CFR part 91 outlines aircraft certifications and equipment requirements for the operation of aircraft in      U.S. airspace. It also prescribes rules governing maintenance, preventive maintenance, and alterations. Also      found in 14 CFR part 91 is the requirement to maintain records of maintenance, preventive maintenance,      and alterations, as well as records of the 100-hour, annual, progressive, and other required or approved      inspections.  

![](images/c162a442f2cd0b8796eead10660e235b492f4870e06d2de412ebaeb4c40e0835.jpg)  
Figure 1-4.  FAA Form 8100-2, Standard Airworthiness Certificate.  

While 14   CFR   part 91,   section   91.205   outlines the minimum   equipment required   for   flight, the Airplane Flight Manual/Pilot’s   Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) lists the equipment required for the airplane to be airworthy. The equipment list found in the  AFM/POH is developed during the airplane certification process. This list identifies those items that are required for airworthiness,  optional equipment installed in addition to the required equipment, and any supplemental items or appliances.  

Figure 1-5  shows an example of some of the required equipment, standard or supplemental (not required but commonly found in the  aircraft) and optional equipment for an aircraft. The equipment list, originally issued by the manufacturer, is maintained by the Type  Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS). An aircraft and its installed components and parts must conform to the original Type Certificate or  approved altered conditions to meet the definition of airworthy in accordance with 14 CFR part 3.5.  

Certification requirements for pilots, medical certificate requirements, and operating rules are found in the following parts:  

⦁  14 CFR part 61 pertains to the certification of pilots, flight instructors, and ground instructors. It      prescribes the eligibility, aeronautical knowledge, flight proficiency training, and testing requirements for      each type of pilot certificate issued.  ⦁  14 CFR part 67 prescribes the medical standards and certification procedures for issuing medical      certificates for airmen and for remaining eligible for a medical certificate.  ⦁  14 CFR part 68 contains requirements for operating certain small aircraft without a medical certificate.  ⦁  14 CFR part 91 contains general operating and flight rules. The section is broad in scope and      provides general guidance in the areas of general flight rules, visual flight rules (VFR), instrument      flight rules (IFR), and as previously discussed aircraft maintenance, and preventive maintenance and      alterations.

# Flight Standards Service  

The   FAA’s   Flight   Standards   Service   (FS)   sets   aviation   standards   for   airmen   and   aircraft   operations   in   the   United   States   and   for  American airmen and aircraft around the world. Flight Standards is organized into four functional offices: Office of Safety Standards,  Air Carrier Safety Assurance, General Aviation Safety Assurance, and Foundational Business.  

The primary interface between FS and the general aviation community/general public is the local Flight Standards District Office  (FSDO). The FSDOs are responsible for the certification and surveillance of certain air carriers, air operators, flight schools/training  centers, airmen (pilots, flight instructors, mechanics and other certificate holders). FSDO inspectors also handle general aviation  accident investigation at the request of, or in cooperation with, the National Transportation Safety Board.  

Each FSDO is staffed by Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASIs) whose specialties include operations, maintenance, and avionics. General  Aviation ASIs are highly qualified and experienced aviators. Once accepted for the position, an inspector will satisfactorily complete  indoctrination training conducted at the FAA Academy. The indoctrination training coursework for a General Aviation Operations  Inspector, which is oriented to the tasks to be performed by an ASI in the general aviation environment, includes classroom and flight  training on pilot certification activities. Thereafter, the inspector will complete recurrent training on a regular basis. Among other  duties, the ASI is responsible for administering FAA practical tests for pilot and flight instructor certificates and associated ratings.  Questions concerning pilot certification and/or requests for other aviation information or services should be directed to the FSDO.  For specific FSDO locations and telephone numbers, refer to  www.faa.gov .  

# Role of the Pilot Examiner  

Pilot and flight instructor certificates are issued by the FAA upon satisfactory completion of required knowledge and practical tests.  The administration of practical tests is an FAA responsibility that may occur at the FSDO level. However, in order to satisfy the  public need for pilot testing and certification services, the FAA delegates certain responsibilities, as the need arises, to private  individuals who are not FAA employees. A Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) is a private citizen who is designated as a  representative of the FAA Administrator to perform specific (but limited) pilot certification tasks on behalf of the FAA and may  charge a reasonable fee   for   doing   so.   Generally,   a DPE’s   authority    limited   to   accepting   applications   and   conducting   practical tests  leading to the issuance of specific pilot certificates and/or ratings. A DPE operates under the direct supervision of the FSDO that  holds   the examiner’s   designation   file.    FSDO inspector    assigned    monitor   the DPE’s   certification   activities.  

The FAA selects highly qualified individuals to be DPEs. These individuals have good industry reputations for professionalism, high  integrity, a demonstrated willingness to serve the public, and adhere to FAA policies and procedures in certification matters. A DPE  is expected to administer practical tests with the same degree of professionalism, using the same methods, procedures, and standards  as an FAA ASI. Note that a DPE is not an FAA ASI. A DPE cannot initiate enforcement action, investigate accidents, or perform  surveillance activities on behalf of the FAA. However, the majority of FAA practical tests at the recreational, private, and commercial  pilot level are administered by DPEs.  

# Role of the Flight Instructor  

The flight instructor is the cornerstone of aviation safety. The FAA has adopted an operational training concept that places the full  responsibility for pilot training on the flight instructor. In this role, the instructor assumes the total responsibility for providing  training in all the knowledge areas and skills necessary for pilots to operate safely and competently in the National Airspace System  (NAS). This training includes airmanship skills, pilot judgment and decision-making, hazard identification, risk analysis, and good  operating practices. (See Risk Management Handbook, FAA-H-8083-2).  [Figure 1-6]  

![](images/fe6210e974852565d72ee441f78dff75c405b60977d73abc5bb1691bf93dbd00.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.  The flight instructor is responsible for teaching and training.  

A flight instructor normally meets broad flying experience requirements, passes rigid knowledge and practical tests, and demonstrates  the ability to apply recommended teaching techniques before being certificated.  

A pilot training program is dependent on the quality of the ground and flight instruction given. A good flight instructor has a  thorough understanding of the learning process, knowledge of the fundamentals of instruction, and the ability to communicate  effectively with the learner.  

A good flight instructor uses a syllabus and insists on correct techniques and procedures from the beginning of training so that the  learner   will develop   proper   habit patterns.   The syllabus   should   embody   the “building   block” method   of   instruction   in   which   the  learner systematically progresses from the known to the unknown. The course of instruction should be laid out so that each new  maneuver embodies the principles involved in the performance of those previously undertaken. Consequently, through each new  subject introduced, the learner not only learns a new principle or technique, but also broadens their application of those previously  learned and has their deficiencies in the previous maneuvers emphasized and made obvious.  [Figure 1-7]  

![](images/c776460217eb76c2db8682fc7f0f3156f6f7a3bce5c0adcca0b55357b91e1363.jpg)  

The flying habits of the flight instructor, both during flight instruction and as observed by learners when conducting other pilot  operations, have a vital effect on safety. Learners consider their flight instructor to be a paragon of flying proficiency whose flying  habits they, consciously or unconsciously, attempt to imitate. For this reason, a good flight instructor meticulously observes the safety  practices taught to the learners. Additionally, a good flight instructor carefully observes all regulations and recognized safety  practices during all flight operations.  

A prospective pilot should know that there are other differences among flight instructors. Certain instructors who have performed at a  high level have earned a Gold Seal Flight Instructor Certificate. This is not a requirement when looking for an instructor, but it is  indication of an active and successful instructor. Top notch instructors also participate in the Pilot Proficiency Awards Wings  Program (Wings program) to improve their proficiency and to serve as an example to learners who also benefit from program  participation.  

Generally, an individual who enrolls in a pilot training program is prepared to commit considerable time, effort, and expense in  pursuit of a pilot certificate. A trainee may judge the effectiveness of the flight instructor and the overall success of the pilot training  program solely in terms of being able to pass the requisite FAA practical test. A good flight instructor is able to communicate that  evaluation through practical tests is a mere sampling of pilot ability that is compressed into a short period of time. The flight  instructor’s   role is    train   the “total” pilot.  

# Sources of Flight Training  

The major sources of flight training in the United States include FAA-approved pilot schools and training centers, non-certificated  (14 CFR part 61) flying schools, and independent flight instructors. FAA-approved schools are those flight schools certificated by the  FAA as pilot schools under 14 CFR part 141.  [Figure 1-8]  

![](images/ea28010683394e192cacf5bfdaea8f8a96127fd9dd1f5ce531d73538838d46bf.jpg)  
Figure 1-8.  FAA Form 8000-4, Air Agency Certificate.  

Application for part 141 certification is voluntary, and the school needs to meet specific requirements for personnel, equipment,  maintenance, and facilities. The school operates each course offering in accordance with an established curriculum that includes a  training course outline (TCO) approved by the FAA. Each TCO contains enrollment prerequisites, a detailed description of each  lesson including standards and objectives, expected accomplishments and standards for each stage of training, and a description of the  checks and tests used to measure each training course enrollee's accomplishments. An FAA-approved pilot school Air Agency  certificate expires and needs to be renewed every 2 years.  

Renewal is contingent upon proof of continued high quality instruction and a minimum level of instructional activity. Training at an  FAA-certificated pilot school is structured and because of this structured environment, the graduates of these pilot schools are  allowed to meet the certification experience requirements of 14 CFR part 61 with less flight time. Many FAA-certificated pilot  schools have DPEs on staff to administer FAA practical tests. Some schools have been granted examining authority by the FAA. A  school with examining authority for a particular course(s) has the authority to recommend its graduates for pilot certificates or ratings  without further testing by the FAA. A list of FAA-certificated pilot schools and their training courses can be found at  https://av-info.faa.gov/pilotschool.asp .  

FAA-approved training centers are certificated under 14 CFR part 142. Training centers, like certificated pilot schools, operate in a  structured environment with approved courses and curricula and stringent standards for personnel, equipment, facilities, operating  procedures, and record keeping. Training centers certificated under 14 CFR part 142, however, specialize in the use of flight  simulation (full flight simulators and flight training devices) in their training courses.  

There are a number of flying schools in the United States that are not certificated by the FAA. These schools operate under the  provisions of 14 CFR part 61. Many of these non-certificated flying schools offer excellent training and meet or exceed the standards  required of FAA-approved pilot schools. Flight instructors employed by non-certificated flying schools, as well as independent flight  instructors, meet the same basic 14 CFR part 61 flight instructor requirements for certification and renewal as those flight instructors  employed by FAA-certificated pilot schools. In the end, any training program is dependent upon the quality of the ground and flight  instruction a learner receives.  

# Airman Certification Standards (ACS) and Practical Test Standards (PTS)  

![](images/9052d4d57daf3bbfc85d91aaa010f7f73482a933c173760975381a40fcd6e361.jpg)  
Figure 1-9.  Airman Certification Standards (ACS) developed by FAA  

Practical tests for FAA pilot certificates and associated ratings are administered by FAA inspectors and DPEs using FAA  Airman Certification Standards (ACS) and Practical Test Standards (PTS), which co n tain structured areas of operation, tasks, and  standards.  [Figure 1-9]  14 CFR part 61, section 61.43 specifies that the practical test consists of the tasks specif i ed in the areas of  operation for the airman certificate or rating sought . To pass the test, the applicant   demonstrat es   mastery of the aircraft  performing each task successfully,  pr oficiency and competency within the approved standards, and sound judgment.  

It should be emphasized that the ACS and PTS are testing documents rather than teaching documents. Although the pilot applicant  should be familiar with these books and refer to the standards they contain during training, the ACS and PTS are not intended to be  used as a training syllabus. They contain the standards to which maneuvers/procedures on FAA practical tests should be performed  and the FAA policies governing the administration of practical tests. An appropriately rated flight instructor is responsible for training  a pilot applicant to acceptable standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and maneuvers included in, and encompassed by, the  tasks within each area of operation in the appropriate ACS and PTS. Flight instructors and pilot applicants should always remember  that safe, competent piloting requires a commitment to learning, planning, and risk management that goes beyond rote performance of  maneuvers. Descriptions of tasks and information on how to perform maneuvers and procedures are contained in reference and  teaching documents, such as this handbook. A list of reference documents is contained in the appendices of each ACS and PTS. It is  necessary that the latest version of the PTS and ACS, with all recent changes, be referenced for training. All recent versions and  changes to the FAA ACS and PTS may be viewed or downloaded at  www.faa.gov .  

# Safety  Considerations  

In the interest of safety and good habit pattern formation, there are certain basic flight safety practices and procedures that should be  emphasized by the flight instructor, and adhered to by both instructor and learner, beginning with the very first dual instruction flight.  These include, but are not limited to, collision avoidance procedures including proper scanning techniques and clearing procedures,  runway incursion avoidance, stall awareness, positive transfer of controls, and flight deck workload management.  

# Collision Avoidance  

All pilots should be alert to the potential for midair collision and impending loss of separation. The general operating and flight rules  in   14   CFR   part   91   set   forth   the   concept   of   “see   and   avoid.”   This   concept   requires   that   vigilance   shall   be   maintained   at all times by  each person operating an aircraft regardless of whether the operation is conducted under IFR or VFR. Pilots should also keep in mind  their responsibility for continuously maintaining a vigilant lookout regardless of the type of aircraft being flown and the purpose of  the flight. Most midair collision accidents and reported near midair collision incidents occur in good VFR weather conditions and  during the hours of daylight. Most of these accident/incidents occur within 5 miles of an airport and/or near navigation aids.  [Figure  1-10]  

![](images/dcc0645387fa7d303a484dfa85a6bc9c225674dff881b94a897c668392707953.jpg)  
Figure 1-10.  Most midair collision accidents occur in good weather.  

The “see   and   avoid” concept relies on   knowledge of   the limitations   of   the human   eye and   the use of   proper   visual scanning   techniques  to help compensate for these limitations. Pilots should remain constantly alert to all traffic movement within their field of vision, as  well as periodically scanning the entire visual field outside of their aircraft to ensure detection of conflicting traffic. Remember that  the performance capabilities of many aircraft, in both speed and rates of climb/descent, result in high closure rates limiting the time  available for detection, decision, and evasive action.  [Figure 1-11]  

![](images/c3944d906cf13578058258d2a319970cf642a3e580626405a33cbd2b931e837f.jpg)  
Figure 1-11.  Proper scanning techniques can mitigate midair collisions. Pilots should be aware of potential blind spots and attempt to  clear the entire area in which they are maneuvering.  

The probability of spotting a potential collision threat increases with the time spent looking outside, but certain techniques may be  used to increase the effectiveness of the scan time. The human eyes tend to focus somewhere, even in a featureless sky. In order to be  most effective, the pilot should shift glances and refocus at intervals. Most pilots do this in the process of scanning the instrument  panel, but it is also important to focus outside to set up the visual system for effective target acquisition. Pilots should also realize that  their eyes may require several seconds to refocus when switching views between items on the instrument panel and distant objects.  

Proper scanning requires the constant sharing of attention with other piloting tasks, thus it is easily degraded by psychological and  physiological conditions such as fatigue, boredom, illness, anxiety, or preoccupation.  

Effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short, regularly-spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of the sky into  the central visual field. Each movement should not exceed 10 degrees, and each area should be observed for at least 1 second to  enable detection. Although horizontal back-and-forth eye movements seem preferred by most pilots, each pilot should develop a  scanning pattern that is comfortable and adhere to it to assure optimum scanning.  

Peripheral vision can be most useful in spotting collision threats from other aircraft. Each time a scan is stopped and the eyes are  refocused, the peripheral vision takes on more importance because it is through this element that movement is detected. Apparent  movement is usually the first perception of a collision threat and probably the most important because it is the discovery of a threat  that triggers the events leading to proper evasive action. It is essential to remember that if another aircraft appears to have no relative  motion, it is likely to be on a collision course. If the other aircraft shows no lateral or vertical motion, but is increasing in size, the  observing pilot needs to take immediate evasive action to avoid a collision.  

The importance of, and the proper techniques for, visual scanning should be taught at the very beginning of flight training. The  competent flight instructor should be familiar with the visual scanning and collision avoidance information contained in AC 90-48,  Pilots’   Role in   Collision   Avoidance , and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

There are many different types of clearing procedures. Most are centered around the use of clearing turns. The essential idea of the  clearing   turn    to   be certain   that the next maneuver    not going   to   proceed   into   another   aircraft’s   flightpath.   Some pilot training  programs have hard and fast rules, such as requiring two   $90^{\circ}$   turns in opposite directions before executing any training maneuver.  Other types of clearing procedures may be developed by individual flight instructors. Whatever the preferred method, the flight  instructor should teach the beginning learner an effective clearing procedure and insist on its use. The learner should execute the  appropriate clearing procedure before all turns and before executing any training maneuver. Proper clearing procedures, combined  with proper visual scanning techniques, are the most effective strategy for collision avoidance.  

In case of pilot incapacitation, an installed Emergency Autoland (EAL) system may take control of an airplane, navigate to an airport,  and land without additional human intervention. Currently, these systems take no evasive action in response to potential impact with  another aircraft, although they transmit over the radio. Pilots should avoid the path of any aircraft under the control of an EAL or  suspected as under the control of an EAL system. The  Emergency Procedures  chapter in this handbook contains additional  information about these systems.  

# Runway Incursion Avoidance  

A runway incursion is any occurrence at an airport involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that creates a  collision hazard or results in a loss of separation with an aircraft taking off, landing, or intending to land. The three major areas  contributing to runway incursions are communications, airport knowledge, and flight deck procedures for maintaining orientation.  [Figure 1-12]  

![](images/d827d51aa46c18ba90b55fc98bcece4cb5a8b00522d6b8dc07cb9631fe709177.jpg)  
Figure 1-12.  Three major areas contributing to runway incursions are communications with air traffic control (ATC), airport  knowledge, and flight deck procedures.  

Taxi operations require constant vigilance by the entire flight crew, not just the pilot taxiing the airplane. During flight training, the  instructor should emphasize the importance of vigilance during taxi operations. Both the learner and the flight instructor need to be  continually aware of the movement and location of other aircraft and ground vehicles on the airport movement area. Many flight  training activities are conducted at non-tower controlled airports. The absence of an operating airport control tower creates a need for  increased vigilance on the part of pilots operating at those airports.  [Figure 1-13]  

![](images/b2611c07300836c81095553693301c57a08f69a02271f23619a6be344bd2b144.jpg)  
Figure 1-13.  Sedona Airport is one of the many airports that operate without a control tower.  

Planning, clear communications, and enhanced situational awareness during airport surface operations reduces the potential for  surface incidents. Safe aircraft operations can be accomplished and incidents eliminated if the pilot is properly trained early on and  throughout their flying career on standard taxi operating procedures and practices. This requires the development of the formalized  teaching of safe operating practices during taxi operations. The flight instructor is the key to this teaching. The flight instructor should  instill in the learner an awareness of the potential for runway incursion, and should emphasize the runway incursion avoidance  procedures. For more information and a list of additional references, refer to Chapter 14 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge .  

# Stall Awareness  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.87 (d)(10) and (e)(10) require that a student pilot who is receiving training for a single-engine or  multiengine airplane rating or privileges, respectively, log flight training in stalls and stall recoveries prior to solo flight. [ Figure 1-14 ]  During this training, the flight instructor should emphasize that the direct cause of every stall is an excessive angle of attack (AOA).  The student pilot should fully understand that there are several flight maneuvers that may produce an increase in the wing’s AOA, but  the stall does not occur until the AOA becomes excessive. This critical AOA varies from   $16^{\circ}–20^{\circ}$   depending on the airplane design.  [ Figure 1-15 ]  

![](images/8de3f5d181a776fe89fd899a46c7bb0f1b0b0a2374320960ca18db91a85ae5b8.jpg)  
Figure 1-14.  All student pilots receive and log flight training in stalls and stall recoveries prior to their first solo flight.  

![](images/e24d9a431c41d7b6ea2a35b17776bff21842a6190780af0fb9b892695ac2a255.jpg)  
Figure 1-15.  Stalls occur when the airfoil's angle of attack reaches the critical point which can vary between   $I6^{\circ}$    and    $20^{\circ}$  

The flight instructor should emphasize that low speed is not necessary to produce a stall. The wing can be brought to an excessive  AOA at any speed. High pitch attitude is not an absolute indication of proximity to a stall. Some airplanes are capable of vertical  flight with a corresponding low AOA. Most airplanes are quite capable of stalling at a level or near level pitch attitude.  

The key   to   stall awareness    the pilot’s   ability   to   visualize   the wing’s   AOA   in   any   particular   circumstance,   and   thereby   be able to  estimate his or her margin of safety above stall. This is a learned skill that should be acquired early in flight training and carried  through   the pilot’s   entire   flying   career.  

The pilot should understand and appreciate factors such as airspeed, pitch attitude, load factor, relative wind, power setting, and  aircraft configuration    order    develop   a reasonably   accurate mental picture of   the wing’s   AOA   at any   particular   time.   It is essential  to   safety   of   flight that pilots   take into   consideration   this   visualization   of   the wing’s   AOA   prior   to   entering   any   flight maneuver.  Chapter 3, Basic Flight Maneuvers, discusses stalls in detail.  

# Use of Checklists  

Checklists have been the foundation of pilot standardization and flight deck safety for years.  [Figure 1-16]  The checklist is a memory  aid and helps to ensure that critical items necessary for the safe operation of aircraft are not overlooked or forgotten. Checklists need  not be “do   lists.” In   other   words,   the proper   actions   can   be accomplished,   and   then   the checklist used   to   quickly   ensure all   necessary  tasks   or   actions   have been   completed   with   emphasis   on   the “check” in   checklist. However,   checklists   are of   no   value if   the pilot is not  committed to using them. Without discipline and dedication to using the appropriate checklists at the appropriate times, the odds are  on the side of error. Pilots who fail to take the use of checklists seriously become complacent and begin to rely solely on memory.

Figure 1-16.  Checklists have been the foundation of pilot standardization and flight safety for many years.  

The importance of consistent use of checklists cannot be overstated in pilot training. A major objective in primary flight training is to  establish habit patterns that will serve pilots well throughout their entire flying career. The flight instructor should promote a positive  attitude toward checklist usage, and the learner should realize its importance. At a minimum, prepared checklists should be used for  the following phases of flight:  [Figure 1-17]  

⦁  Preflight inspection  ⦁  Before engine start  ⦁  Engine starting  ⦁  Before taxiing  ⦁  Before takeoff  ⦁  After takeoff  ⦁  Cruise  ⦁  Descent  ⦁  Before landing   $\circ$    After landing  ⦁  Engine shutdown and securing

Figure 1-17.  A sample checklist used by pilots.  

During flight training, there should be a clear understanding between the learner and flight instructor of who has control of the  aircraft. Prior to any flight, a briefing should be conducted that includes the procedures for the exchange of flight controls. The  following three-step process for the exchange of flight controls is highly recommended.  

When   a flight   instructor   wishes   the   learner   to   take   control   of   the   aircraft,   he   or   she   should   say   to   the   learner,   “You   have   the flight  controls.”   The   learner   should   acknowledge   immediately   by   saying,   “I   have   the   flight   controls.”   The   flight   instructor   should   then  confirm   by   again   saying,   “You   have the flight controls.” Part of   the procedure should   be a visual check    ensure that the other person  actually has the flight controls. When returning the controls to the flight instructor, the learner should follow the same procedure the  instructor   used   when   giving   control to   the learner.   The learner   should   stay   on   the controls   until the instructor   says,   “I   have the flight  controls.” There should   never   be any   doubt as to   who    flying   the airplane at any   time.   Numerous   accidents   have occurred   due   to a  lack of communication or misunderstanding as to who actually had control of the aircraft, particularly between learners and flight  instructors. Establishing the above procedure during initial training ensures the formation of a very beneficial habit pattern.  

# Continuing Education  

In many activities, the ability to receive feedback and continue learning contributes to safety and success. For example, professional  athletes receive constant coaching. They practice various techniques to achieve their best. Medical professionals read journals, train,  and master techniques to achieve better outcomes.  

# FAA W INGS  Program  

Compare continuous training and practice to 14 CFR part 61, section 61.56(c)(1)   and (2) , which allows for training and a sign-off  within the previous 24 calendar months in order to act as a pilot in command. Many astute pilots realize that this regulation specifies a  minimum requirement, and the path to enhanced proficiency, safety, and enjoyment of flying takes a higher degree of  commitment such as using 14 CFR part 61, section 61.56(e). For this reason, many pilots keep their flight review up-to-date  using the FAA WINGS program. The program provides continuing pilot education and contains interesting and relevant study  materials that pilots can use all year round.  

A pilot may create a WINGS account by logging on to  www.faasafety.gov .  This account gives the pilot access to the  latest information concerning aviation technology and risk mitigation. It provides a means to document targeted skill  development as a means to increase safety. As an added bonus, participants may receive a discount on certain flight insurance  policies.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discussed some of the concepts and goals of primary and intermediate flight training. It identified and provided  an explanation of regulatory requirements and the roles of the various entities involved. It also offered recommended techniques to  be practiced and refined to develop the knowledge, proficiency, and safe habits of a competent pilot.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3 C Chapter 2: Ground Operations  

# Introduction  

Experienced pilots place a strong emphasis on ground operations as this is where safe flight begins and ends. They know that hasty  ground operations diminish their margin of safety. A smart pilot takes advantage of this phase of flight to assess various factors  including   the regulatory   requirements,   the pilot’s   readiness   for   pilot-in-command   (PIC)   responsibilities, the airplane’s   condition,   the  flight environment, and any external pressures that could lead to inadequate control of risk.  

Flying an airplane presents many new responsibilities not required for other forms of transportation. Focus is often placed on the  flying portion itself with less emphasis placed on ground operations. However pilots need to allow time for flight preparation.  Situational awareness begins during preparation and only ends when the airplane is safely and securely returned to its tie-down or  hangar, or if a decision is made not to go.  

This chapter covers the essential elements for the regulatory basis of flight including:  

1. An   airplane’s   airworthiness   requirements,   2. Important inspection items when conducting a preflight visual inspection,  3. Managing risk and resources, and  4. Proper and effective airplane surface movements using the AFM/POH and airplane checklists.  

# Preflight Assessment of the Aircraft  

The visual preflight assessment mitigates airplane flight hazards. The preflight assessment ensures that any aircraft flown meets  regulatory airworthiness standards and is in a safe mechanical condition prior to flight. Per 14 CFR part 3, section 3.5(a), the   term “airworthy” means that the aircraft conforms to its type design and is in condition for safe operation. The owner/operator is  primarily responsible for maintenance, but in accordance with 14 CFR part 91, section 91.7(a) and (b) no person may operate a civil  aircraft unless it is in an airworthy condition and the pilot in command of a civil aircraft is responsible for determining whether the  aircraft is in condition for safe flight. The pilot's inspection should involve the following:  

1. Inspecting   the airplane’s   airworthiness   status.   2. Following the AFM/POH to determine the required items for visual inspection.  [Figures 2-1, 2-2, 2-3]  

![](images/a219e55dee3f8a242caf2982e9e444400f6376ad6758adbc27458fbc1a5b3e74.jpg)  
Figure 2-1.  Pilots   should   view the aircraft’s maintenance   logbook prior    flight to   ensure the aircraft is   safe to   fly.

Figure 2-3.  Airplane Flight Manuals (AFM) and the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH) for each individual aircraft explain the  required items for inspection.  

Each airplane has a set of logbooks that include airframe and engine, and in some cases, propeller and appliance logbooks, which are  used to record maintenance, alteration, and inspections performed on a specific airframe, engine, propeller, or appliance. It is  important that the logbooks be kept accurate, secure, and available for inspection. Airplane logbooks are not normally kept in the  airplane. It should be a matter of procedure by the pilot to inspect the airplane logbooks or a summary of the airworthy status prior to  flight to ensure that the airplane records of maintenance, alteration, and inspections are current and correct.  [Figure 2-4]  The  following is required:  

⦁  Annual inspection within the preceding 12 calendar  months (Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations 

    (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.409(a))  

⦁  100-hour inspection, if the aircraft is operated for hire (14 CFR part 91, section 91.409(b))  

⦁  Transponder certification within the preceding 24 calendar months (14 CFR part 91, section 91.413)  

⦁  Static system and encoder certification, within the preceding 24 calendar months, required for instrument 

     flight rules (IFR) flight in controlled airspace (14 CFR part 91, section 91.411)  

⦁  30-day VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) equipment check when using the VOR system of radio 

     navigation for IFR flight (14 CFR part 91, section 91.171)  

⦁  Emergency locator transmitter (ELT) inspection within the last 12 months (14 CFR part 91, section 

     91.207(d))  

⦁  ELT battery due (14 CFR part 91, section 91.207(c))  

⦁  Current status of life limited parts per Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS) (14 CFR part 91, section 

     91.417)  

⦁  Status, compliance, logbook entries for airworthiness directives (ADs) (14 CFR part 91, section 91.417(a) 

     (2)(v))  

⦁  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Form 337, Major Repair or Alteration (14 CFR part 91, section 

     91.417)  

⦁  Inoperative equipment (14 CFR part 91, section 91.213)  

![](images/fe130b491fcce25bd88eed9cfeec455f4e5e2857faf563b13f8e34b8c714387e.jpg)  
Figure 2-4.  A sample airworthiness checklist used by pilots to inspect an aircraft.  

A review determines if the required maintenance and inspections have been performed on the airplane. Any discrepancies need to be  addressed   prior   to   flight. Once   the pilot has determined   that the airplane’s   logbooks   provide factual assurance   that the airplane meets  its airworthiness requirements, it is appropriate to inspect the airplane visually. The visual preflight inspection of the airplane should  begin while approaching the airplane on the ramp. The pilot should make note of the general appearance of the airplane, looking for  discrepancies such as misalignment of the landing gear and airplane structure. The pilot should also take note of any distortions of the  wings, fuselage, and tail, as well as skin damage and any staining, dripping, or puddles of fuel or oils.  

The pilot needs to determine that the following documents are, as appropriate, on board, attached, or affixed to the airplane:  

⦁  Current Airworthiness Certificate (14 CFR part 91, section 91.203)  ⦁  Current Registration Certificate (14 CFR part 91, section 91.203)  ⦁  Radio station license for flights outside the United States or airplanes greater than 12,500 pounds (Federal      Communications Commission (FCC) rule)  ⦁  Operating limitations, which may be in the form of an FAA-approved AFM/POH, placards, instrument      markings, or any combination thereof (14 CFR part 91, section 91.9)  ⦁  Current weight and balance data  ⦁  Compass correction card, if required under applicable airworthiness standards  ⦁  External data plate (14 CFR part 45, section 45.11)  

# Visual Preflight Assessment  

The inspection should start with the cabin door. If the door is hard to open or close, does not fit snugly, or the door latches do not  engage or disengage smoothly, the surrounding structure, such as the doorpost, should be inspected for misalignment, which could  indicate structural damage. The visual preflight inspection should continue to the interior of the cabin or flight deck where carpeting  should be inspected to ensure that it is serviceable, dry, and properly affixed; seat belts and shoulder harnesses should be inspected to  ensure that they are free from fraying, latch properly, and are securely attached to their mounting fittings; seats should be inspected to  ensure that the seats properly latch into the seat rails through the seat lock pins and that seat rail holes are not abnormally worn to an  oval shape;  [Figure 2-5]  the windshield and windows should be inspected to ensure that they are clean and free from cracks, and  crazing. A dirty, scratched, and/or a severely crazed window can result in near zero visibility due to light refraction at certain angles  from the sun.  

![](images/902ad037edc3f1481f54d3144f0b7e796301a443927a5d3d392bed2b246596b4.jpg)  
Figure 2-5.  Seats should be inspected to ensure that they are properly latched into the seat rails and checked for damage.  

The AFM/POH or a third party checklist based on the AFM/POH may be used to conduct the visual preflight inspection, and each  manufacturer has a specified sequence for conducting the actions. In general, the following items are likely to be included in the  AFM/POH preflight inspection:  

⦁  Landing gear control is DOWN, if applicable.  

⦁  Master, alternator, and magneto switches are OFF.  

⦁  Control column locks are REMOVED.  

⦁  Fuel selectors should be checked for proper operation in all positions, including the OFF position.      Stiff fuel selectors or where the tank position is not legible or lacking detents are unacceptable.  

⦁  Trim wheels, which include elevator and may include rudder and aileron, are set for takeoff position.  

⦁  Mechanical air-driven gyro instruments should be inspected for signs of hazing on the instrument       face, which may indicate leaks.  

⦁  Avionics master is OFF.  

⦁  Confirm that the landing gear handle is in the DOWN position, then turn the master switch ON. Note       the fuel quantities on the fuel gauges and compare to the tank level by visual inspection. If so       equipped, fuel pumps may be placed in the ON position to verify fuel pressure in the proper       operating range.  

⦁  Other items may include checking that lights for both the interior and exterior airplane positions are      operating and checking any annunciator panels.  

⦁  If the airplane has retractable gear, landing gear down  and locked lights are checked green.  

⦁  Flight instruments should read as follows:  

⦁  Airspeed should read zero.  

⦁  The altimeter, when properly set to the current barometric setting, should indicate the field      elevation within 75 feet for IFR flight.  ⦁  If   installed,   the magnetic compass   should   indicate   the airplane’s   direction   accurately; and   the        compass correction card should be legible and complete. For conventional wet magnetic       compasses, the instrument face should be clear and the instrument case full of fluid. A cloudy       instrument face, bubbles in the fluid, or a partially filled case renders the compass unusable.  ⦁  The vertical speed indictor (VSI) should read zero. If the VSI does not show a zero reading, a       small screwdriver can be used to zero this instrument if not part of an electronic display. The       mechanical VSI is the only flight instrument that a pilot has the prerogative to adjust. All others       need to be adjusted by an FAA-certificated repairman or mechanic.  ⦁  Avionics master switch ON to check avionics. Avionics master switch OFF, master switch OFF.  

Aircraft   equipped   with   Integrated   Flight   Deck   (IFD)   “glass-panel”   avionics   and   supporting   systems   have   specific   requirements   for   checking prior to flight.  Ground-based inspections may include verification that the flight deck reference guide is in the aircraft and  accessible;   checking   of   system   driven   removal   of   “Xs”   over   engine   indicators;   checking   pitot/static   and   attitude   displays;   testing of  low level alarms and annunciator panels; setting of fuel levels; and verification that the avionics cooling fans, if equipped,  are functional.  [Figure 2-6]  The AFM/POH specifies how these preflight inspections are to take place. Since an advanced  avionics aircraft preflight checklist may be extensive, pilots should allow time to ensure that all items are properly addressed.  

![](images/8fe7e91483962ccacdee84282e9207a13834f5fe7bea8cb9dbadd2f5eb76d751.jpg)  
Figure 2-6.  Ground-based   inspections   include verification   that “Xs”   on   the instrument display are displayed   until the sensor activates.  

# Outer Wing Surfaces and Tail Section  

Generally, the AFM/POH specifies a sequence for the pilot to inspect the aircraft that may sequence from the cabin entry access  opening and then in a counterclockwise direction until the aircraft has been completely inspected. Besides the AFM/POH preflight  assessment, the pilot should also develop awareness for potential areas of concern, such as signs of deterioration or distortion of the  structure, whether metal or composite, as well as loose or missing rivets or screws.  

In addition to items specified in the AFM/POH for inspection, the pilot should have an awareness for critical areas, such as spar lines,  wing, horizontal, and vertical attach points including wing struts and landing gear attachment areas. The airplane skin should be  inspected in these areas as load-related stresses are concentrated along spar lines and attach points. Spar lines are lateral rivet lines  that extend across the wing, horizontal stabilizer, or vertical stabilizer. Pilots should pay close attention to spar lines looking for  distortion, ripples, bubbles, dents, creases, or waves as any structural deformity may be an indication of internal damage or failure.  Inspect around rivet heads looking for cracked paint or a black-oxide film that forms when a rivet works free in its hole.  [Figure 2-7]  

![](images/9819d99b6745ddb4424fc0edbf602b6790cc2db099304385b7d8a1ffb199bdff.jpg)  
Figure 2-7.  Example of rivet heads where black oxide film has formed due to the rivet becoming loose in its hole.  

Additional areas that should be scrutinized are the leading edges of the wing, horizontal stabilizer, and vertical stabilizer. These areas  may have been impact-damaged by rocks, ice, birds, and/or hangar rash incidents. Certain dents and dings may render the structure  unairworthy. Some leading edge surfaces have aerodynamic devices, such as stall fences, slots, or vortex generators, and deicing  equipment, such as weeping wings and boots. If these items exist on the airplane, the pilot should know their proper condition so that  an adequate preflight inspection may occur.  

On metal airplanes, wingtips, fairings, and non-structural covers may be fabricated out of thin fiberglass or plastic. These items are  frequently affected by cracks radiating from screw holes or concentrated radii. Often, if any of these items are cracked, it is practice  to “stop-drill” the crack to prevent crack progression.  [Figure 2-8]  Extra care should be exercised to ensure that these devices are in  good condition without cracks that may render them unairworthy. Cracks that have continued beyond a stop - drilled location or  any new adjacent cracks that have formed may lead to in-flight failure.  

![](images/98de0a79f2448af15268606a4166a4e99525fd88b078305ad8bf9e22be0da9e9.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.  Cracks radiating from screw holes that have been stop-drilled to prevent crack progression.  

Inspecting composite airplanes can be more challenging as the airplanes generally have no rivets or screws to aid the pilot in  identifying spar lines and wing attach points. However, delamination of spar to skin or other structural problems may be identified by  bubbles, fine hair-line cracks, or changes in sound when gently tapping on the  structure with a fingertip. Anything out of place should  be addressed by discussing the issue with a properly rated aircraft mechanic.  

# Fuel and Oil  

While there are various formulations of aviation gasoline (AVGAS), only three grades are conventional: 80/87, 100LL, and 100/130.  100LL is the most widely available in the United States. AVGAS is dyed with a faint color for grade identification: 80/87 is dyed red;   $100\mathrm{LL}$   is dyed blue; and 100/130 is dyed green. All AVGAS grades have a familiar gasoline scent and texture. 100LL with its blue  dye is sometimes difficult to identify unless a fuel sample is held up against a white background in reasonable white lighting.  

Aircraft piston engines certificated for grade 80/87 run satisfactorily on   $100\mathrm{LL}$   if approved as an alternate. The reverse is not true.  Fuel of a lower grade should never be substituted for a required higher grade. Detonation will severely damage the engine in a very  short period of time. Detonation, as the name suggests, is an explosion of the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder. During detonation,  the fuel/air charge (or pockets within the charge) explodes rather than burns smoothly. Because of this explosion, the charge exerts a  much higher force on the piston and cylinder, leading to increased noise, vibration, and cylinder head temperatures. The violence of  detonation also causes a reduction in power. Mild detonation may increase engine wear, though some engines can operate with mild  detonation regularly. However, severe detonation can cause engine failure in minutes.  [Figure 2-9]  Because of the noise that it  makes, detonation is "engine knock" or "pinging" in cars.  

When approved for the specific airplane to be flown, automobile gasoline is sometimes used as a substitute fuel in certain airplanes.  Its use is acceptable only when the particular airplane has been issued a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to both the airframe  and engine.  

Jet fuel is a kerosene-based fuel for turbine engines and a new generation of diesel-powered airplanes. Jet fuel has a  stubborn, distinctive, non-gasoline odor and is oily to the touch. Jet fuel is clear or straw - colored, although it may appear dyed when  mixed with AVGAS. Jet fuel has disastrous consequences when introduced into AVGAS - burning reciprocating airplane engines. A  reciprocating engine operating on jet fuel may start, run, and power the airplane long enough for the airplane to become airborne ,   only to have the engine fail catastrophically after takeoff.

Figure 2-9.  An aircraft piston showing damage that occurred in just minutes as a result of detonation and overheating.  

Jet fuel refueling trucks and dispensing equipment are marked with JET-A placards in white characters on a black background.  Because of the dire consequences associated with misfueling, fuel nozzles are specific to the type of fuel. AVGAS fuel filler nozzles  are straight with a constant diameter.  [Figure 2-10]  However, jet fuel filler nozzles are flared at the end to prevent insertion into  AVGAS fuel tanks.  [Figure 2-11]  

![](images/c3d6afe8df3bd085da6b29c67ee20aa658431cfb04a26b8c1e12009fd895e9a2.jpg)

Figure 2-11.  A jet fuel filler nozzle is flared at the end to prevent an inadvertent insertion into an AVGAS tank.  

Using the proper, approved grade of fuel is critical for safe, reliable engine operation. Without the proper fuel quantity, grade, and  quality, the engine(s) will likely cease to operate. Therefore, it is imperative that the pilot visually verify that the airplane has the  correct  fuel  quantity for the intended flight plus adequate and legal reserves, as well as inspect that the fuel is of the proper grade and  that the quality of the fuel is acceptable. The pilot should always ensure that the fuel caps have been securely replaced following  each fueling.  

Many airplanes experience sensitivity to attitude when fueling for maximum capacity. Nosewheel or main landing gear strut  extension, both high as well as low, and the slope of the ramp can significantly alter the attitude of the aircraft and therefore the fuel  capacity. Always positively confirm the fuel quantity indicated on the fuel gauges by visually inspecting the level of fuel in each tank.  

The pilot should be aware that fuel stains anywhere on the wing or any location where a fuel tank is mounted warrants further  investigation—no matter how old the stains appear to be. Fuel stains are a sign of probable fuel leakage. On airplanes equipped with  wet-wing fuel tanks, evidence of fuel leakage can be found along rivet lines.  [Figure 2-12]  

![](images/2de27fdbbe00c269bef71ea8c77fa28df055939fbc1320d69832a6fce0ed264d.jpg)  
Figure 2-12.  Evidence of fuel leakage can be found along rivet lines.  

Checking for water and other sediment contamination is a key preflight item. Water tends to accumulate in fuel tanks from  condensation, particularly in partially filled tanks. Because water is heavier than fuel, it tends to collect in the low points of the fuel  system. Water can also be introduced into the fuel system from deteriorated gas cap seals exposed to rain or from the supplier’s   storage tanks and delivery vehicles. Sediment contamination can arise from dust and dirt entering the tanks during refueling or from  deteriorating rubber fuel tanks or tank sealant. Deteriorating rubber from seals and sealant may show up in the fuel sample as small  dark specks.  

The best preventive measure is to minimize the opportunity for water to condense in the tanks. If possible, the fuel tanks should be  completely filled with the proper grade of fuel after each flight, or at least filled after the last flight of the day. The more fuel that is in  the tanks, the less room  there is   for condensation to occur. Keeping fuel tanks filled is also the best way to slow the aging of  rubber fuel tanks and tank sealant.  

Sufficient fuel should be drained from the fuel strainer quick drain and from each fuel tank sump to check for fuel grade/color, water,  dirt, and odor. If water is present, it is usually in bubble or bead-like droplets, different in color (usually clear, sometimes muddy  yellow to brown with specks of dirt), in the bottom of the sample jar. In extreme water contamination cases, consider the possibility  that the entire fuel sample, particularly if a small sample was taken, is water. If water is found in the first fuel sample, continue  sampling until no water and contamination appears. Significant and/or consistent water, sediment or contaminations are grounds for  further investigation by qualified maintenance personnel. Each fuel tank sump should be drained during preflight and after refueling.  The order of sumping the fuel system is often very important. Check the AFM/POH for specific procedures and order to be followed.  

Checking the fuel tank vent is an important part of a preflight assessment. If outside air is unable to enter the tank as fuel is drawn into  the engine, the eventual result is fuel starvation and engine failure. During the preflight assessment, the pilot should look for signs of  vent damage and blockage. Some airplanes utilize vented fuel caps, fuel vent tubes, or recessed areas under the wings where vents are  located. The pilot should use a flashlight to look at the fuel vent to ensure that it is free from damage and clear of obstructions. If  there is a rush of air when the fuel tank cap is cracked, there could be a serious problem with the vent system.  

Aviation oils are available in various single/multi-grades and mineral/synthetic-based formulations. It is important to use the  approved and recommended oil for the engine at all times. The oil not only acts as a lubricant but also as a medium to transfer heat as  a result of engine operation and to suspend dirt, combustion byproducts, and wear particles between oil changes. Therefore, the  proper level of oil is required to ensure lubrication, effective heat transfer, and the suspension of various contaminants. The oil level  should be checked during each preflight, rechecked with each refueling, and maintained to prevent the oil level from falling below the  minimum required during engine operation.  

During the preflight assessment, if the engine is cold, oil levels on the oil dipstick show higher levels than if the engine was warm and  recently shutdown after a flight. When removing the oil dipstick, care should be taken to keep the dipstick from coming in contact  with dirty or grimy areas. The dipstick should be inspected to verify the oil level. Typically, piston airplane engines have  oil reservoirs with capacities between four and eight quarts, with six quarts being common.  Aside from   the level of oil, the  oil’s color  also  provides an insight as to its operating condition. Oils darken in color as the oil operating hours increase—this  is common and expected as the oil traps contaminants. However, oils that rapidly darken in the first few hours of use after an oil  change may indicate engine cylinder problems. Piston airplane engines consume a small amount of oil during normal  operation. The amount of consumption varies on many factors; however, if consumption increases or suddenly changes, qualified  maintenance personnel should investigate  

It is suggested that the critical aspect of fuel and oil  not  be left to line service personnel without oversight of the pilot responsible for  flight. While line personnel are aviation professionals, the pilot is responsible for the safe outcome of any flight. During refueling or  when oil is added to an engine, the pilot should monitor and ensure that the correct quantity, quality, and grade of fuel and oil is  added and that all fuel and oil caps have been securely replaced.  

# Landing Gear, Tires, and Brakes  

The landing gear, tires, and brakes allow the airplane to maneuver from and return to the ramp, taxiway, and runway environment in a  precise and controlled manner. The landing gear, tires, and brakes should be inspected to ensure that the airplane can be positively  controlled on the ground. Landing gear on airplanes varies from simple fixed gear to complex retractable gear systems.  

Fixed landing gear is a gear system in which the landing gear struts, tires, and brakes are exposed and lend themselves to relatively  simple inspection. However, more complex airplanes may have retractable landing gear with multiple tires per landing gear strut,  landing gear doors, over-center locks, springs, and electrical squat switches. Regardless of the system, the pilot should follow the  AFM/POH during inspection to determine that the landing gear is ready for operation.  

On many fixed-gear airplanes, inspection of the landing gear system can be hindered by wheel pants, which are covers used to reduce  aerodynamic   drag.    is   still   the   pilot’s   responsibility   to   inspect   the   airplane   properly.   A   flashlight   helps   the   pilot   in   peering into  covered areas. On low-wing airplanes, covered or retraceable landing gear presents additional effort required to crouch below the  wing to inspect the landing gear properly.  

The following provides guidelines for inspecting the landing gear system; however, the AFM/POH should be the pilot’s reference for  the appropriate procedures.  

⦁  The pilot, when approaching the airplane, should look at the landing gear struts and the adjacent ground for      leaking hydraulic fluid that may be coming from struts, hydraulic lines from landing gear retraction pumps,      or from the braking system. Landing gear should be relatively free from grease, oil, and fluid without any      undue amounts. Any amount of leaking fluid is unacceptable. In addition, an overview of the landing gear      provides an opportunity to verify landing gear alignment and height consistency.  ⦁  All landing gear shock struts should also be checked to ensure that they are properly inflated, clean, and      free from hydraulic fluid and damage. All axles, links, collars, over-center locks, push rods, forks, and      fasteners should be inspected to ensure that they are free from cracks, corrosion,  and  rust, and  are in an       airworthy  condition .  ⦁  Tires should be inspected for proper inflation, an acceptable level of remaining tread, and normal wear      pattern. Abnormal wear patterns, sidewall cracks, and damage, such as cuts, bulges, imbedded foreign      objects, and visible cords, render the tire unairworthy. For airplanes that are flown by more than one pilot,      what happened to the tires on previous flights becomes a significant unknown. Therefore, when possible,      the airplane should be moved slightly to allow for evaluation of the complete tire circumference.  ⦁  Wheel hubs should be inspected to ensure that they are free from cracks, corrosion, and rust, that all      fasteners are secure, and that the air valve stem is straight, capped, and in good condition.  ⦁  Brakes and brake systems should be checked to ensure  that they are free from rust and corrosion and that  all fasteners and safety wires are secure. Brake pads should have a proper amount of material remaining and  should be secure. All brake lines should be secure, dry, and free of signs of hydraulic leaks, and devoid of      abrasions and deep cracking.  ⦁  On tricycle gear airplanes, a shimmy damper is used to damp oscillations of the nose gear and should be      inspected to ensure that it is securely attached, is free of hydraulic fluid leaks, and is in overall good      condition. Some shimmy dampers do not use hydraulic fluid and instead use an elastomeric compound as      the dampening medium. Nose gear links, collars, steering rods, and forks should be inspected to ensure the      security of fasteners, minimal free play between torque links, crack-free components, and for proper      servicing and general condition.  ⦁  On some conventional gear airplanes, those airplanes with a tailwheel or skid, the main landing gear may  have bungee cords to help in absorbing landing loads and shocks. The bungee cords must be inspected for  security and condition.  ⦁  Where the landing   gear   transitions   into   the airplane’s   structure,   the pilot should   inspect the attachment  points and the airplane skin in the adjacent area—the pilot needs to inspect for wrinkled or other damaged  skin, loose bolts, and rivets and verify that the area is free from corrosion.  

# Engine and Propeller  

Properly managing the risks associated with flying requires that the pilot of the airplane identify and mitigate any potential hazards  prior to flight to prevent, to the furthest extent possible, a hazard becoming a realized risk. The engine and propeller make up the  propulsion system of the airplane—failure of this critical system requires a well-trained and competent pilot to respond with  significant time constraints to what is likely to become a major emergency.  

The pilot needs to ensure that the engine, propeller, and associated systems are functioning properly prior to operation. This starts  with an overview of the cowling that surrounds the airplane engine. The pilot should look for loose, worn, missing, or damaged  fasteners, rivets, and latches that secure the cowling around the engine and to the airframe. The pilot should be vigilant as fasteners  and rivets can be numerous and surround the cowling requiring a visual inspection from above, the sides, and the bottom. Like other  areas on the airframe, rivets should be closely inspected for looseness by looking for signs of a black oxide film around the rivet head.  The pilot should pay attention to chipped or flaking paint around rivets and other fasteners as this may be a sign of a lack of security.  Any cowling security issues need to be referred to a competent and rated airplane maintenance mechanic.  

From the cowling, a general inspection of the propeller spinner, if so equipped, should be completed. Not all airplane/propeller  combinations have a spinner, so adherence to the AFM/POH checklist is required. Spinners are subjected to great stresses and should  be inspected to be free from dents, cracks, corrosion, and in proper alignment. Cracks may not only occur at locations where fasteners  are used but also on the rear - facing spinner plate. In conditions where ice or snow may have entered the spinner around the propeller  openings, the pilot should inspect the area to ensure that the spinner is internally free from ice. The engine/propeller/spinner is  balanced around the crankshaft and a small amount of ice or snow can produce damaging vibrations. Cracks, missing fasteners, or  dents result in a spinner that is unairworthy.  

The propeller should be checked for blade erosion, nicks, cracks, pitting, corrosion, and security. On controllable pitch propellers, the  propeller hub should be checked for oil leaks that tend to stream directionally from the propeller hub toward the tip. On airplanes so  equipped, the alternator/generator drive belts should be checked for proper tension and signs of wear.  

When inspecting inside the cowling, the pilot should check all surfaces for oil leaks or deterioration of oil and hydraulic lines, and  make certain that the oil cap, filter, oil cooler, and drain plug are secure. The pilot should look for signs of fuel dye, which may  indicate a fuel leak. Note that both fuel and oil stains may appear on a cowling inner surface. Observation may be difficult without the  aid of a flashlight, so even during day operations, a flashlight is handy when peering into the cowling. The pilot should also check for  loose or foreign objects inside the cowling, such as bird nests, shop rags, and/or tools. All visible wires and lines should be checked  for security and condition. The exhaust system should be checked for white stains caused by exhaust leaks at the cylinder head or  cracks in the exhaust stacks. The heat muffs, which provide cabin heating on some airplanes, should also be checked for general  condition and signs of cracks or leaks. An isolated area of oxidized darkened paint on the engine may indicate an area experiencing  excessive heat. If visible, the condition of the firewall may be checked for integrity.  

The air filter should be checked to ensure that it is free from substantial dirt or restrictions, such as bugs, birds, nests, or other causes  of airflow restriction. In addition, air filter elements are made from various materials. In all cases, the element should be free from  decomposition and properly serviced.  

# Risk and Resource Management  

Ground   operations   also   include the pilot’s   assessment of   the risk   factors   that contribute to   safety   of   flight and   the pilot’s   management  of   the   resources,   which   may   be   leveraged   to   maximize   the   flight’s   successes.   The   Risk   Management   Handbook   (FAA-H-8083-2)  should be reviewed for a comprehensive discussion of this topic. A review of key points follows.  

Approximately 85 percent of all aviation accidents have been determined by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to  have   been   caused   by   “failure   of   the   pilot   to...”   As   such,   a reduction   of   these   failures   is   the   fundamental   cornerstone   to   risk and  resource management. The risks involved with flying an airplane are very different from those experienced in daily activities, such as  driving to work. Managing risks and resources requires a conscious effort that goes beyond the stick and rudder skills required to  pilot the airplane.  

# Risk Management  

Risk management is a formalized structured process for identifying and mitigating hazards and assessing the consequences and  benefits of the accepted risk. A hazard is a condition, event, object, or circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an unplanned  or undesired event, such as an incident or accident. It is a source of potential danger. Some examples of hazards are:  

1.   Marginal weather or environmental conditions  2.   Lack of pilot qualification, currency, or proficiency for the intended flight .  

# Identifying the Hazard  

Hazard identification is the critical first step of the risk management process. If pilots do not recognize and properly identify a hazard  and choose to continue, the consequences of the risk involved is not managed or mitigated. In the previous examples, the hazard  identification process results in the following assessment:  

⦁  Marginal weather or environmental conditions is an identified hazard because it may result in the pilot  having a skill level that is not adequate for managing the weather conditions or requiring airplane  performance that is unavailable.  

⦁  The lack of pilot training is an identified hazard because the pilot does not have experience to either meet  the legal requirements or the minimum necessary skills to safely conduct the flight.  

Risk is the future impact of a hazard that is not controlled or eliminated. It can be viewed as future uncertainty created by the hazard.  

⦁  If the weather or environmental conditions are not properly assessed, such as in a case where an airplane  may encounter inadvertent instrument conditions, loss of airplane control may result.  ⦁  If   the pilot’s   lack   of   training    not properly   assessed,   the pilot may   be placed    flight regimes that exceed   the pilot’s stick - and - rudder capability.  

# Risk Assessment  

Risk assessment determines the degree of risk and whether the degree of risk is worth the outcome of the planned activity. Once the  planned activity is started, the pilot needs to consider whether to continue or not. A pilot should always have viable alternatives  available in the event the original flight plan cannot be accomplished. Thus, hazard and risk are the two defining elements of risk  management. A hazard can be a real or perceived condition, event, or circumstance that a pilot encounters. Risk assessment is a  quantitative value weighted to a task, action, or event. When armed with the predicted risk assessment of an activity, pilots are able to  manage and mitigate their risk.  

In the example where marginal weather is the identified hazard, it is relatively simple to understand that the consequences of loss of  control  during any inadvertent encounter with   instrument   meteorological conditions (IMC) are likely to be severe for a pilot  not  prepared to fly on an  instrument flight  plan . A risk assessment  for any such pilot  in this example would determine that the risk is  unacceptable and as a result, mitigation of the risk is required. Proper risk mitigation would require that flight be  canceled   or delayed  until weather conditions were not conducive for inadvertent flight into instrument meteorological conditions.  

# Risk Identification  

Identifying hazards and associated risk is key to preventing risk and accidents. If a pilot fails to search for risk, it is likely that he or  she will neither see it nor appreciate it for what it represents. Unfortunately, in aviation, pilots seldom have the opportunity to learn  from their small errors in judgment because even small mistakes in aviation are often fatal. In order to identify risk, the use  of standard procedures is of great assistance. Several procedures are discussed in detail in the Risk Management Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-2).  

# Risk Mitigation  

Risk assessment is only part of the equation. After determining the level of risk, the pilot needs to mitigate the risk. For example,  the VFR pilot flying from point A to point B (50 miles) in marginal flight conditions has several ways to reduce risk:  

1. Wait for the weather to improve to good VFR conditions.  2.  Take a pilot who is more experienced or who is  certified as an instrument flight rules (IFR) pilot.  3. Delay the flight.  4. Cancel the flight.  5. Drive.  

# Resource Management  

Familiarity with crew resource management (CRM) and single-pilot resource management (SRM) enables a crew or pilot to manage  all available resources effectively and leads to a successful flight. In general aviation, SRM comes into play more often. The focus of  SRM is on the single-pilot operation. SRM integrates the following:  

⦁  Situational Awareness  ⦁  Human Resource Management  ⦁  Task Management  ⦁  Aeronautical Decision-making (ADM)  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is the accurate perception of operational and environmental factors that affect the flight. It is a logical analysis  based upon the airplane, external support, environment, and the pilot. It is awareness on what is happening in and around the flight.  

Human Resource Management  

Human  r esource  m anagement requires an effective use of all available resources: human, equipment, and information.  

Human resources include the essential personnel routinely working with the pilot to ensure safety of flight. These people include, but  are not limited to: weather briefers, flight line personnel, maintenance personnel, crew members, pilots, and air traffic personnel.  Pilots need to communicate effectively with these people. This is accomplished by using the key components of the communication  process: inquiry, advocacy, and assertion. Pilots should recognize the need to seek enough information from these resources to make  a valid   decision.   After   the necessary   information   has been   gathered,   the pilot’s   decision   should   be passed   on    those concerned, such  as air traffic controllers, crewmembers, and passengers. The pilot may have to request assistance from others and be assertive to  resolve some situations safely.  

Equipment   in   many   of   today’s   aircraft   includes   automated   flight   and   navigation   systems.   These   automatic   systems,   while   providing  relief from many routine tasks, present a different set of problems for pilots. The automation intended to reduce pilot workload  essentially removes the pilot from the process of managing the aircraft, thereby reducing situational awareness and leading to  complacency. Information from these systems needs to be continually monitored to ensure proper situational awareness. Pilots should  be aware of both equipment capabilities and equipment limitations in order to manage those systems effectively and safely.  

Information workloads and automated systems, such as autopilots, need to be properly managed to ensure a safe flight. By planning  ahead, a pilot can effectively reduce workload during critical phases of flight and prevent erosion of performance. The pilot who  effectively manages his or her workload completes routine tasks as early as possible to preclude the possibility of becoming  overloaded and stressed in the later, more critical stages of the flight.  

# Task Management  

Pilots   have a limited   capacity   for   information.   Once   information   flow   exceeds   the pilot’s   ability   to   process   the information   mentally,  any additional information becomes unattended or displaces other tasks and information already being processed. In addition,  distraction and fixation impede the ability to process information. For example, if a pilot becomes distracted and fixates on an  instrument light failure, the unnecessary focus displaces capability and prevents appreciation of tasks of greater importance.  

Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)  

Flying safely requires the effective integration of three separate sets of skills: stick-and - rudder skills needed to control the airplane;  skills related to proficient operation of aircraft systems; and ADM skills. The ADM process addresses all aspects of decision-making  in the flight deck and identifies the steps involved in good decision-making. While the ADM process does not eliminate errors, it  helps the pilot recognize errors and enables the pilot to manage the error to minimize its effects. These steps are:  

1. Identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight;  2. Learning behavior modification techniques;  3. Learning how to recognize and cope with stress;  4. Developing risk assessment skills;  5. Using all resources; and  6. Evaluating   the effectiveness   of   one’s   own   personal ADM   skills.  

# Ground Operations  

The airport ramp can be a complex environment with airport personnel, passengers, trucks, other vehicles, aircraft, and errant people  and animals. The pilot is responsible for the operation of the airplane and should operate safely at all times. Ground operations  subject the pilot to unique hazards, and mitigating those hazards requires proper planning and good situational awareness in the  ground environment. A mitigation tactic involves reviewing the airport diagram prior to operating and having it readily available at  all times. Whether departing to or from the ramp, the pilot needs to understand and capably manage the following:  

1. Refueling operations  2. Passenger and baggage security and loading  3. Ramp and taxi operations  4. Standard ramp signals  

During refueling operations, it is advisable that the pilot remove all passengers from  the  aircraft and witness the refueling to ensure  that the correct fuel and quantity is dispensed into the airplane and that any caps and cowls are properly secured after refueling.  

Passengers may have little experience with the open ramp of an airport. The pilot should ensure the safety of the passengers by  cautioning them to move on the surface only as directed. If not under the pilot's direct supervision, passengers should have an escort  to ensure their safety and ramp security. Baggage loading and security should also be supervised by the pilot. Unsecured baggage or  improperly loaded baggage may adversely affect the center of gravity of the aircraft.  

Ramp traffic may vary from a deserted open space to a complex environment with heavy corporate or military aircraft. Powerful  aircraft may produce exhaust blast or rotor downwash, for example, which could easily cause a light airplane to become  uncontrollable. Mitigating these hazards in a light airplane is important to starting off on a safe flight.  

Some ramps may be staffed by personnel to assist the pilot in managing a safe departure from the ramp to the taxiway.  Figure 2-13  shows standard aircraft taxiing signals, such as those published in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). There are other  standard signals, such as those published in Advisory Circular 00-34, as revised, and by the Armed Forces. Furthermore, operation  conditions in many areas may call for a modified set of taxi signals. The signals shown in  Figure 2-13  represent a minimum number  of the most commonly used signals. Whether this set of signals or a modified set is used is not the most important consideration, as  long as each flight operational center uses a suitable, agreed-upon set of signals.

# Engine Starting  

Airplane engines vary substantially and specific procedures for engine starting should be accomplished in reference to  the  approved engine start checklist as detailed in the airplane’s AFM/POH. However, some generally accepted hazard mitigation  practices and procedures are outlined in this section.  

Prior to engine start, the pilot needs to ensure that the ramp area surrounding the airplane is clear of persons, equipment, and other  hazards that could come into contact with the airplane or the propeller. Also, the pilot should check what is behind the airplane prior  to engine start as standard practice. A propeller or other engine thrust can accelerate ob j ects to substantial velocities, causing damage  to property, and injuring those on the ground. The pilot should mitigate the hazard of debris being blown into persons or property. At  all times before engine start, the anti-collision lights should be turned on. For night operations, the position (navigation) lights should  also   be   on.   Finally,   just   prior   to   starter   engagement,   the   pilot   should   always   call   “CLEAR”   out   of   the   side   window   and   wait   for a  response from anyone who may be nearby  before   engaging the starter.  

When activating the starter, the wheel brakes need to be depressed and one hand kept on the throttle to manage the initial starting  engine speed. Ensuring that properly operating brakes are engaged prior to starter engagement prevents the airplane from rapidly  lunging forward. After engine start, the pilot manipulates the throttle to set the engine revolutions per minute (rpm)  to   the AFM/POH ­   prescribed setting. In general, 1,000 rpm is recommended following engine start to allow oil pressure to rise and to minimize undue  engine wear due to insufficient lubrication at high rpm. It is important to service an airplane engine with the proper grade of oil for  the seasonal conditions and to apply engine preheat when temperatures approach and descend below freezing.  

The oil pressure should be monitored after engine start to ensure that pressure is increasing toward the AFM/POH - specified value.  The AFM/POH specifies an oil pressure range for the engine. If the limits are not reached and maintained, serious internal engine  damage is likely. In most conditions, oil pressure should rise to at least the lower limit within 30 seconds. To prevent damage, the  engine should be shut down immediately if the oil pressure does not rise to the AFM/POH values within the required time.  

Engine starters are electric motors designed to produce rapid rotation of the engine crankshaft for starting. These electric motors are  not   designed for continuous duty. Their service life may be drastically shortened during a prolonged or difficult start as an ex c ess  buildup of heat can damage internal starter components. Avoid continuous starter operation for periods longer than 30 seconds  without a cool down period of at least 30 seconds to 1 minute (some AFM/POH specify longer cool down routines). The smell  of burning insulation from a starter may indicate that the recommended cranking time has been exceeded. After repeated  unsuccessful start attempts, the pilot should seek advice from a qualified person to determine the cause for the difficulty.  

Although quite rare, the starter motor may remain electrically and mechanically engaged after engine start. This can be detected by a  continuous and very high current draw on the ammeter. Some airplanes also have a starter engaged warning light specifically for this  purpose. The engine should be shut down immediately if this occurs.  

The pilot should be attentive for sounds, vibrations, smell s , or smoke that are not consistent with normal after - start  operational experience. Any concerns should lead to a shutdown and further investigation.  

# Hand Propping  

The procedures for hand propping should always be in accordance with the AFM/POH and performed only by persons who are  competent with hand propping procedures. The consequences of the hazards associated with hand propping are serious to fatal.  

Historically,   when   aircraft   lacked   electrical   systems,   it was   necessary   for   pilots   and   ground   personnel to   “hand   prop” an   aircraft for  starting. Today, most airplanes are equipped with electric starters, and the starter should be working if the airplane is airworthy. If  not, a certificated Aviation Maintenance Technician should be called to make a repair. However, vintage airplanes may be  encountered, and an airplane manufactured without an electric starter needs to be hand propped. Since a number of these airplanes  have been produced, the procedures for hand propping are described in this section.  

A few simple precautions help to avoid accidents when hand propping the engine. While touching a propeller, always assume that the  ignition is on. The switches that control the magnetos operate on the principle of short-circuiting the current to turn the ignition off. If  the switch    faulty,   it can   be in   the “off” position   and   still   permit current to   flow    the magneto   primary   circuit. This   condition could  allow the engine to start when the switch is off.  

Hand propping an aircraft is a hazardous procedure when done perfectly. Not mitigating the hazards associated with hand propping  can lead to serious injury and a runaway airplane. A spinning propeller can be lethal should it strike someone. Persons not trained, not  competent, or who do not understand how to mitigate the hazards associated with hand propping should  never  perform this  procedure!  

Hand propping requires a team of two properly trained people. Both individuals should be familiar with the airplane and hand  propping techniques. The first person is responsible for directing the procedure including pulling the propeller blades through. The  second person sits in the airplane to ensure that the brakes are set and to exercise controls as directed by the person pulling the  propeller. When hand propping occurs, a person unfamiliar with the controls should  never  occupy   the pilot’s   seat.  

When hand propping is necessary, the ground surface near the propeller should be stable and free of debris. Loose gravel, wet grass,  grease, mud, oil, ice, or snow might cause the person pulling the propeller through to slip into the rotating blades as the engine starts.  Unless a firm footing is available, relocate the airplane to mitigate this hazardous consequence.  

Both participants should discuss the procedure and agree on voice commands and expected actions. To begin the procedure, the fuel  system and engine controls (tank selector, primer, pump, throttle, and mixture) are set for normal start. The ignition/magneto switch  should be checked to be sure that it is OFF. Then ,   the descending propeller blade should be rotated so that it assumes a  position slightly above the horizontal. The person doing the hand propping should face the descending blade squarely and stand  slightly less than one arm’s length from the blade. If a stance too far away were assumed, it would be necessary to lean forward in an  unbalanced condition to reach the blade, which may cause the person to fall forward into the rotating blades when the engine  starts. Allowing space for the person to be able to step away as the propeller is pulled down, and the engine starts, serves as  safeguard in case the brakes fail.  

The procedure and commands for hand propping are:  

⦁  Person   out front says,   “FUEL   ON,   SWITCH OFF, THROTTLE   CLOSED,   BRAKES SET.”   ⦁  Pilot seat occupant, after making sure the fuel is ON,  mixture is RICH, magneto switch is OFF, throttle is  CLOSED,   and   brakes are SET,   says,   “FUEL   ON,   SWITCH OFF, THROTTLE   CLOSED,   BRAKES SET.”   ⦁  Person   out front, after   pulling   the propeller   through    prime the engine says,   “BRAKES AND CONTACT.”   ⦁  Pilot seat occupant checks   the brakes SET   and   turns   the magnetos   switch   ON,   then   says,   “BRAKES AND    CONTACT.”  

The words CONTACT (magnetos ON) and SWITCH OFF (magnetos OFF) are used because they are significantly different from  each other. Under noisy conditions or high winds, the words CONTACT and SWITCH OFF are less likely to be misunderstood than  SWITCH ON and SWITCH OFF.  

The propeller is swung by forcing the blade downward rapidly, pushing with the palms of both hands. If the blade is gripped tightly  with   the   fingers,   the   person’s   body   may   be   drawn   into   the   propeller   blades   should   the   engine   misfire,   "kickback,"   or   rotate  momentarily in the opposite direction. As the blade is pushed down, the person should step backward, away from the propeller. If the  engine does not start, the propeller should not be repositioned for another attempt until it is verified that the magneto switch is turned  OFF. Excessive throttle opening after the engine has fired is the principal cause of backfiring during starting. Gradual opening of the  throttle, while the engine is cold, reduces the potential for backfiring. Slow, smooth movement of the throttle assures correct engine  operation.  

Immediately after the engine starts, check the oil pressure indicator. If oil pressure does not show within 30 seconds, stop the engine  and   determine   the   trouble.   If   oil   pressure   is   indicated,   adjust   the   throttle   to   the   aircraft   manufacturer’s   specified   rpm   for   engine  warmup, which is usually between 1,000 to   $1{,}300\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

Most aircraft reciprocating engines are air - cooled and depend on the forward speed of the aircraft to maintain proper cooling.  Therefore, particular care is necessary when operating these engines on the ground. During all ground running, operate the engine  with the propeller in full low pitch and headed into the wind with the cowling installed to provide the best degree of engine cooling.  Closely monitor the engine instruments at all times. Do not close the cowl flaps for engine warm-up, they need to be in the open  position while operating on the ground. When warming up the engine, ensure that personnel, ground equipment that may be damaged,  or other aircraft are not in the propeller wash.  

When removing the wheel chocks or untying the tail after the engine starts, everyone involved should remember that the propeller is  nearly invisible. Serious injuries and fatalities have occurred when people who have just started an engine walk or reach into the  propeller arc to remove the chocks, reach the cabin, or when moving toward the tail of the airplane. Before the wheel chocks are  removed, the throttle should be set to idle and the chocks approached only from the rear of the propeller. One should never approach  the wheel chocks from the front or the side.  

# Taxiing  

Taxiing is the controlled movement of the airplane under its own power while on the surface. Since an airplane is moved under its  own power between a parking area and the runway, the pilot needs to understand and be proficient in taxi procedures.  

A pilot should maintain situational awareness of the ramp, parking areas, taxiways, runway environment, and the persons, equipment  and aircraft at all times. Without such awareness, safety may be compromised. Depending on the airport, the parking, ramp, and  taxiways may or may not be controlled. As such, it is important that the pilot completely understands the operating environment. At  small, rural airports these areas may be desolate with few aircraft and limited hazards; however, as the complexity of the airport  increases so does the potential for hazards. Regardless of the complexity, some generally accepted procedures are appropriate.  

⦁  The pilot should be familiar with the parking, ramp, and taxi environment. This can be done by having an      airport diagram, if available, out and in view at all times.  [Figure 2-14]  

![](images/2e9003440ce13afc3964a1efbd3e4f983643e2eb4d8dae1e26239c139437601d.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.  Airport Diagram of Monterey Peninsula (MRY), Monterey, California.  

⦁  Despite having familiarity with the airport, pilots should carefully review their complete taxi plan. For      example, a pilot given the same taxi instructions by ATC, starts expecting those same instructions and      might not realize that those instructions no longer apply. It only takes missing one instruction or turn to      generate an accident. It is a human tendency to follow the same procedure over and over. This expectation      bias has occurred to many pilots who did not stop and carefully consider and evaluate their taxi instructions.  ⦁  The pilot should be vigilant of the entire area around the airplane to ensure that the airplane clears all      obstructions. If, at any time, there is doubt about a safe clearance from an object, the pilot should stop the      airplane and check the clearance. It may be necessary to have the airplane towed or physically moved by a      ground crew.  ⦁  When   taxiing,   the pilot’s   eyes should   be looking   outside the airplane scanning   from   side to   side while  looking both near and far to assess routing and potential conflicts.  ⦁  A safe taxiing speed should be maintained. The primary requirements for safe taxiing are positive control,      the ability to recognize any potential hazards in time to avoid them, and the ability to stop or turn where and      when desired, without undue reliance on the brakes. Pilots should proceed at a cautious speed on congested      or busy ramps. Normally, the speed should be at the rate where movement of the airplane is dependent on      the throttle. That is, slow enough so when the throttle is closed, the airplane can be stopped promptly.  ⦁  The pilot should place the aircraft on the taxiway center. Some taxiways have above - ground taxi lights and      signage that could impact the airplane or propellers if the pilot does not exercise accurate control. When      yellow taxiway centerline stripes are present, the pilot should visually place the centerline stripe so it is      under the center of the airplane fuselag e.  ⦁  W hen taxiing, the pilot should slow down before attempting a turn. Sharp high-speed turns place undesirable      side loads on the landing gear and may result in tire damage or an uncontrollable swerve or a ground loop.      Swerves are most likely to occur when turning from a downwind heading toward an upwind heading. In      moderate to high-wind conditions, the airplane may weathervane increasing the swerving tendency.  

Steering is accomplished with rudder pedals and brakes. To turn the airplane on the ground, the pilot should apply the rudder in the  desired direction of turn and use the appropriate power or brake to control the taxi speed. The rudder pedal should be held in the  direction of the turn until just short of the point where the turn is to be stopped. Rudder pressure is then released or  opposite  pressure  is applied as needed.  

More engine power may be required to start the airplane moving forward, or to start a turn, than is required to keep it moving in any  given direction. When using additional power, the throttle should immediately be retarded once the airplane begins moving to prevent  excessive acceleration.  

The brakes should be tested for proper operation as soon as the airplane is put in motion. Applying power to start the airplane moving  forward slowly, then retarding the throttle and simultaneously applying just enough pressure to one side, then the other to confirm  proper function and reaction of both brakes. This is best if the airplane has individual left/right brakes to stop the airplane. If braking  performance is unsatisfactory, the engine should be shut down immediately.  

When taxiing at appropriate speeds in no-wind conditions, the aileron and elevator control surfaces have little or no effect on  directional control of the airplane. These controls should not be considered steering devices and should be held in a neutral position.  

When taxiing with a quartering headwind, the wing on the upwind side (the side that the wind is coming from) tends to be lifted by  the wind unless the aileron control is held in that direction (upwind aileron UP). Moving the aileron into the UP position reduces the  effect of the wind striking that wing, thus reducing the lifting action. This control movement also causes the downwind aileron to be  placed in the DOWN position, thus a small amount of lift and drag on the downwind wing, further reducing the tendency of  the upwind wing to rise.  [Figure  2 -15]  

When taxiing with a quartering tailwind, the elevator should be held in the DOWN position, and the upwind aileron, DOWN. Since  the wind is striking the airplane from behind, these control positions reduce the tendency of the wind to get under the tail and the  wing and to nose the airplane over. The application of these crosswind taxi corrections helps to minimize the weathervaning tendency  and ultimately results in easier steering.  [Figure  2 -15]  

The presence of moderate to strong headwinds and/or a strong propeller slipstream creates lift on the horizontal tail surfaces  and makes it necessary to control the pitch attitude while taxiing. The elevator control in nosewheel-type airplanes should be held  in the neutral position, while in tailwheel-type airplanes, it should be held in the full aft position to hold the tail down unless  the headwind gets very strong, which allows for an elevator position closer to neutral.  

Downwind taxiing usually requires less engine power after the initial ground roll has begun, since the wind is pushing the airplane  forward.   To   avoid   overheating   the brakes and   controlling   the airplane’s   speed   when   taxiing   downwind,   the pilot should   keep   engine  power to a minimum. Rather than continuously riding the brakes to control speed, it is appropriate to apply brakes only occasionally.  Other than sharp turns at low speed, the throttle should always be at idle before the brakes are applied. It is a common error to taxi  with a power setting that requires controlling taxi speed with the brakes.

Figure 2-15.  Control positions of the nosewheel airplane.  

Normally, all turns should be started using the rudder pedal to steer the nosewheel. To tighten the turn after full pedal deflection is  reached, the brake may be applied as needed. When stopping the airplane, it is always advisable to stop with the nosewheel straight  ahead to relieve any side load on the nosewheel and to make it easier to start moving ahead. Note that certain makes and models have  no nosewheel steering and the brakes need to be used to control any turns.  

During crosswind taxiing, even the nosewheel-type airplane has some tendency to weathervane. However, the weathervaning  tendency is less than in tailwheel-type airplanes because the main   wheels   are located   behind   the airplane’s   center   of   gravity,   and   the  nosewheel’s   ground   friction   helps   to   resist the tendency.   The nosewheel linkage from   the rudder   pedals provides adequate steering  control for safe and efficient ground handling, and normally, only rudder pressure is necessary to correct for a crosswind.  

Taxiing checklists are sometimes specified by the AFM/POH, and the pilot should accomplish any items that are required. If there are  no specific checklist items, taxiing still provides an opportunity to verify the operation and cross-check of the flight instruments. In  general, the flight instruments should indicate properly with the airspeed at or near zero (depending on taxi speed, wind speed and  direction, and lower limit sensitivity); the attitude indicator should indicate pitch and roll level (depending on airplane attitude) with  no flags; the altimeter should indicate the proper elevation within prescribed limits; the turn indicator should show the correct  direction of turn with the ball movement toward the outside of the turn with no flags; the directional gyro should be set and crossed  checked to the magnetic compass and verified accurate to the direction of taxi; and the vertical speed indicator (VSI) should read  zero. These checks can be accomplished on conventional mechanical instrumented aircraft or those with glass displays.  

# Before-Takeoff Check  

The before-takeoff check is the systematic AFM/POH procedure for checking the engine, controls, systems, instruments, and avionics  prior to flight. Normally, the before-takeoff checklist is performed after taxiing to a run-up position near the takeoff end of the  runway. Many engines require that the oil temperature reach a minimum value as stated in the AFM/POH before takeoff power is  applied. Taxiing to the run-up position usually allows sufficient time for the engine to warm up to at least minimum operating  temperature; however, the pilot  should  verif y  that  the oil  temperature  is within  the proper range prior to the application of high power.  

A suitable location for run-up should be firm (a smooth, paved or turf surface if possible) and free of debris. Otherwise, the propeller  may pick up pebbles, dirt, mud, sand, or other loose objects and hurl them backwards. This damages the propeller and may damage  the tail of the airplane. Small chips in the leading edge of the propeller form stress risers or high stress concentrations. These are  highly undesirable and may lead to cracks and possible propeller blade failure. The airplane should also be positioned clear of other  aircraft and the taxiway. There should not be anything behind the airplane that might be damaged by the propeller airflow blasting  rearward.  

Before beginning the before-takeoff check, after the airplane is properly positioned for the run-up, it should be allowed to roll  forward slightly to ensure that the nosewheel or tailwheel is in alignment with the longitudinal axis of the airplane.  

While performing the before-takeoff check in accordance with the airplane’s AFM/POH, the pilot divides attention between the  inside and outside of the airplane. If the parking brake slips, or if application of the toe brakes is inadequate for the amount of power  applied, the airplane could rapidly move forward and go unnoticed if pilot attention is fixed only inside the airplane. A good  operational practice is to split attention from one item inside to a look outside.  

Air-cooled engines generally are tightly cowled and equipped with baffles that direct the flow of air to the engine in sufficient  volumes for cooling while in flight; however, on the ground, much less air is forced through the cowling and around the baffling.  Prolonged ground operations may cause cylinder overheating long before there is an indication of rising oil temperature. To minimize  overheating during engine run-up, it is recommended that the airplane be headed as nearly as possible into the wind and, if equipped,  engine instruments that indicate cylinder head temperatures should be monitored. Cowl flaps, if available, should be set according to  the AFM/POH.  

Each airplane has different features and equipment and the before-takeoff checklist provided in airplane’s AFM/POH should be used  to perform the run-up. Many critical systems are checked and set during the before-takeoff check. Most airplanes have at least the  following systems checked and set:  

⦁  Fuel System—set per the AFM/POH and verified ON and the proper and correct fuel tanks selected.  ⦁  Trim—set for takeoff position ,  which includes the elevator and may also include rudder and aileron trim.  

⦁  Flight Controls—checked throughout their entire operating range. This includes full aileron, elevator, and      rudder deflection in all directions. Often, pilots do not exercise a full range of movement of the flight      controls, which is not acceptable.  

⦁  Engine Operation—checked to ensure that temperatures and pressures are in their normal ranges; magneto      or Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) operation on single or dual ignition are acceptable and      within limits; and, if equipped, carburetor heat is functioning. If the airplane is equipped with a constant      speed or feathering propeller, that its operation is acceptable, and the engine continues to run normally as      the propeller is exercised.  

⦁  Electrical System—verified to ensure voltages are within operating range and that the system shows the      battery system charging.  

⦁  Vacuum System—shows an acceptable level of vacuum, which is typically between 4.8 and 5.2 inches of      mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   at   $2{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$  . Refer to the AFM/POH for the manufacturer’s values. It is important to ensure   that  m echanical gyroscopic instruments have adequate time to spool up to acceptable rpm in order for them to    indicate properly. A hasty and quick taxi and run-up does not allow mechanical gyroscopic instruments to      indicate properly and a departure into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is unadvisable.  ⦁  Flight Instruments – rechecked and set for the departure. Verify that the directional gyro and the magnetic      compass are in agreement. If the directional gyro has a heading bug, it may be set to the runway heading that  is in use or as assigned by air traffic control (ATC).  ⦁  Avionics – set with the appropriate frequencies, initial navigation sources and courses, autopilot preselects,      transponder   codes, and   other   settings   and   configurations   based   on   the airplane’s   equipment and   flight       requirements.  ⦁  Takeoff Briefing – made out loud by the pilot even when no other person is there to listen. It should include      a visual verification of the correct surface and direction to preclude a wrong surface departure. A sample      takeoff briefing may be the following:  

“This will be normal takeoff (use normal, short, or soft as appropriate) from runway (use runway assigned), wind is from the  (direction and speed), rotation speed is (use the specified or calculated manufacturer’s takeoff or rotation speed   $\left(\mathrm{V_{R}}\right)$  , an  initial turn to (use planned heading) and climb to (use initial altitude in feet). The takeoff will be rejected for engine failure  below   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$  , applying appropriate braking, stopping ahead. Engine failure after   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    and with runway remaining, I will lower  pitch, land, and apply appropriate braking, stopping straight ahead. Engine failure after  $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    and with no runway remaining, I  will lower pitch to best glide speed, no turns will be made prior to (insert appropriate altitude), land in the most suitable area,  and apply appropriate braking, avoiding hazards on the ground as much as possible. I will only consider turning back to  runway __ if I have reached at least __ feet AGL, which would be __ feet MSL. If time permits, fuel, ignition, and electrical  systems   will be switched   off.”  

# Takeoff Checks  

The pilot should ensure that r unway numbers on paved runways agree with magnetic compass and heading indicators before  beginning takeoff roll. The last check as power is brought to full takeoff power includes:  

1.   Doors latched and windows closed as required?  2.   Controls positioned to account for any crosswind?  3.   Power correct?  4.   Engine rpm   normal?  5.   Engine smooth?  6.   Engine instruments normal and in green ranges?  

# After-Landing  

During the after-landing roll, while maintaining airplane track over runway centerline with ailerons and heading down runway with  rudder pedals, the airplane should be gradually slowed to normal taxi speed with normal brake pressure before turning off of the  landing runway. Any significant degree of turn at faster speeds could result in subsequent damage to the landing gear, tires, brakes, or  the airplane structure.  

To give full attention to controlling the airplane during the landing roll, the after-landing checklist should be performed only after the  airplane is brought to a complete stop beyond the runway holding position markings. There have been many cases where a pilot has  mistakenly manipulated the wrong handle and retracted the landing gear, instead of the flaps, due to improper division of attention  while the airplane was moving. However, this procedure may be modified if the manufacturer recommends that specific after-landing  items be accomplished during landing rollout. For example, when performing a short-field landing, the manufacturer may recommend  retracting the flaps on rollout to improve braking. In this situation, the pilot should make a positive identification of the flap control  handle before retracting the flaps.  

# Clear of Runway and Stopped  

Because of different configurations and equipment in various airplanes, the after-landing checklist within the AFM/POH should be  used. Some of the items may include:  

1. Power—set to the AFM/POH values such as throttle 1,000 rpm, propeller full forward, mixture leaned.  2. Fuel—may require switching tanks and fuel pumps switched off.  3. Flaps—set to the retracted position.  4. Cowl flaps—may be opened or closed depending on temperature conditions.  5. Trim—reset to neutral or takeoff position.  6. Lights—may be switched off if not needed, such as strobe lights.  7. Avionics—frequencies and transponder set for arrival airport taxi procedures.  

# Parking  

Unless parking in a designated, supervised area, the pilot should select a location and heading that prevents propeller or jet blast of  other airplanes from striking the airplane unnecessarily. Whenever possible, the airplane should be parked headed into the existing or  forecast wind. Often airports have airplane tie downs located on ramp areas which may or may not be aligned with the wind or  provide a significant choice in parking location. After stopping in the desired direction, the airplane should be allowed to roll straight  ahead enough to straighten the nosewheel or tailwheel.  

# Engine Shutdown  

The pilot should   always   use the procedures in   the airplane’s   AFM/POH shutdown   checklist for   shutting   down   the engine and   securing  the airplane. Important items may include:  

1. Parking Brake—set to ON.  2. Throttle—set to IDLE or 1,000 rpm.  3. If turbocharged,   observe the manufacturer’s   spool down   procedure.   4. Magneto Switch Test—momentarily check for proper grounding in the OFF position at idle rpm.  5. Propeller Control—set to HIGH rpm, if equipped.  6. Avionics—turn OFF.  7. Alternator—turn OFF.  8. Mixture—set to IDLE CUTOFF.  9. Magneto Switch—turn ignition switch to OFF when engine stops.  10.  Install chocks (release parking brake in accordance  with AFM/POH).  11. Master Switch—turn OFF.  12. Secure—install control locks and anti-theft security locks.  

# Post-Flight  

A flight is not complete until the engine is shut down and the airplane is secured. A pilot should consider this an essential part of any  flight.  

# Securing and Servicing  

After engine shutdown and deplaning passengers, the pilot should accomplish a post-flight inspection. This includes a walk around to  inspect the general condition of the aircraft. Inspect near and around the cowling for signs of oil or fuel streaks and around the oil  breather for excessive oil discharge. Inspect under wings and other fuel tank locations for fuel stains. Inspect landing gear and tires  for damage and brakes for any leaking hydraulic fluid. Inspect cowling inlets for obstructions.  

Oil levels should be checked and quantities brought to AFM/POH levels. Fuel should be added based on the immediate use of the  airplane. If the airplane is going to be inactive, it is a good operating practice to fill the fuel tanks to prevent water condensation from  forming inside the tank. If another flight is planned, the fuel tanks should be filled based on the flight planning requirements for that  flight.  

The aircraft should be hangared or tied down, flight controls secured, and security locks in place. The type of tie downs may vary  significantly from chains to well-worn ropes.  Chains are not flexible and as such should not be made taut so as to allow the airplane  some movement and prevent airframe structural damage.  Tie down   ropes are flexible and   may   be reasonably   cinched    the airplane’s   tie down rings. Consider utilizing pitot tube covers, cowling inlet covers, rudder gust locks, window sunscreens, and propeller  security locks to further enhance the safety and security of the airplane.  

Hangaring is not without hazards to the airplane. The pilot should ensure that enough space is allocated to the airplane so it is free  from any impact to the hangar, another aircraft, or vehicle. The airplane should be inspected after hangaring to ensure that no damage  was imparted on the airplane.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter places emphasis on determining the airworthiness of the airplane, preflight visual inspection, managing risk and pilot- available resources, safe surface-based operations, and the adherence to and proper use of the AFM/POH and checklists. The pilot  should ensure that the airplane is in a safe condition for flight, and it meets all the regulatory requirements of 14 CFR part 91. A pilot  also needs to recognize that flight safety includes proper flight preparation and having the experience to manage the risks associated  with the expected conditions. An effective and continuous assessment and mitigation of the risks and appropriate utilization of  resources goes a long way provided the pilot honestly evaluates their ability to act as PIC.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 3: Basic Flight Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

Airplanes operate in an environment that is unlike an automobile. Drivers tend to drive with a fairly narrow field of view and focus  primarily on forward motion. Beginning pilots tend to practice the same. Flight instructors face the challenge of teaching beginning  pilots about attitude awareness; which requires understanding the motions of flight. An airplane rotates in bank, pitch, and yaw while  also moving horizontally, vertically, and laterally. The four fundamentals (straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents) are  the principal maneuvers that control the airplane through the six motions of flight.  

# The Four Fundamentals  

To master any subject, one should first master the fundamentals. For flying, this includes straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and  descents. All flying tasks are based on these maneuvers, and an attempt to move on to advanced maneuvers prior to mastering the four  fundamentals hinders the learning process.  

Consider the following: a takeoff is a combination of a ground roll, which may transition to a brief period of straight-and-level flight,  and a climb. After - departure includes the climb and turns toward the first navigation fix and is followed by straight-and-level flight.  The preparation for landing at the destination may include combinations of descents, turns, and straight-and-level flight. In a typical  general aviation ( GA )   airplane, the final approach ends with a transition from descent to straight-and-level while slowing for the  touchdown and ground roll.  

The flight instructor needs to impart competent knowledge of these basic flight maneuvers so that the beginning pilot is able to  combine them at a performance level that at least meets the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airman Certification Standards  (ACS) or Practical Test Standards (PTS). As the beginning pilot progresses to more complex flight maneuvers, any deficiencies in the  mastery of the four fundamentals are likely to become barriers to effective and efficient learning.  

# Effect and Use of Flight Controls  

The airplane flies in an environment that allows it to travel up and down as well as left and right. Note that movement  up or down  depends on the flight conditions. If the airplane is right-side up relative to the horizon, forward control stick or wheel (elevator  control) movement will result in a loss of altitude. If the same airplane is upside - down relative to the horizon that same forward  control movement will result in a gain of altitude.  [Figure 3-1]     The following discussion considers the pilot's frame of reference with  respect to the flight controls.  [Figure 3-2]  

![](images/8643ee171396911908fd1fc1dadf61930dd34751479672c5ee8e25800edaf58a.jpg)

Figure 3-2.  The pilot is always considered the referenced center of effect as the flight controls are used.  

With   the pilot’s   hand:  

⦁  When pulling the elevator pitch control toward the pilot, which is an aft movement of the control wheel,       yoke,   control stick,   or   side stick   controller   (referred    as adding   back   pressure),   the airplane’s   nose will        rotate backwards relative to the pilot around the pitch (lateral) axis of the airplane. Think of this movement       from   the pilot’s   feet to   the pilot’s   head.   ⦁  When pushing elevator pitch control toward the instrument panel, (referred to as increasing forward       pressure), the airplane rotates the nose forward relative to the pilot around the pitch axis of the airplane.       Think   of   this   movement from   the pilot’s   head    the pilot’s   feet.   ⦁  When right pressure is applied to the aileron control, which rotates the control wheel or yoke       clockwise,   or   deflects the control stick   or   side stick    the right, the airplane’s   right wing   banks   (rolls)        lower    relation    the pilot. Think   of   this   movement from   the pilot’s   head    the pilot’s   right hip.   ⦁  When left pressure is applied to the aileron control, which rotates the control wheel or yoke       counterclockwise,   or   deflects the control stick   or   side stick    the left, the airplane’s   left wing   banks        (rolls)   lower    relation    the pilot. Think   of   this   movement from   the pilot’s   head    the pilot’s   left hip.  

With   the pilot’s   feet:  

⦁  When   forward   pressure is   applied    the right rudder   pedal,   the airplane’s   nose moves (yaws)    the right in      relation    the pilot. Think   of   this   movement from   the pilot’s   left shoulder    the pilot’s   right shoulder.   ⦁  When   forward   pressure is   applied    the left rudder   pedal,   the airplane’s   nose moves (yaws)    the left in        relation    the pilot. Think   of   this   movement from   the pilot’s   right shoulder    the pilot’s   left shoulder.  

While in flight, the control surfaces remain in a fixed position as long as all forces acting upon them remain balanced. Resistance to  movement increases as airspeed increases and decreases as airspeed decreases. Resistance also increases as the controls move away  from a streamlined position. While m a ne u vering the airplane, it is not the amount of control surface displacement the pilot needs to  consider, but rather the application of flight control pressures that give the desired result.  

The pilot should hold the pitch and roll flight controls (aileron and elevator controls, yoke, stick, or side-stick control) lightly with the  fingers and not grab or squeeze them with the entire hand. When flight control pressure is applied to change a control surface  position, the pilot should exert pressure on the aileron and elevator controls with the fingers only. This is an important concept and  habit to learn. A common error with beginning pilots is that they grab the aileron and elevator controls with a closed palm with such  force that sensitive feeling is lost.  Pilots may wish to consider this error at the onset of training as it prevents the development of  “feel,” which is an important aspect of airplane control.  

So that slight rudder pressure changes can be felt, both heels should support the weight of the pilot's feet on the floor with the ball of  each foot touching the individual rudder pedals. The legs and feet should be relaxed. When using the rudder pedals, pressure should be  applied smoothly and evenly by pressing with the ball of one foot. Since the rudder pedals are interconnected through springs or a  direct mechanical linkage and act in opposite directions, when pressure is applied to one rudder pedal, foot pressure on the opposite  rudder pedal should be relaxed proportionately.  

In summary, during flight, the pressure the pilot exerts on the aileron and elevator controls and rudder pedals causes the airplane to  move about the roll (longitudinal), pitch (lateral), and yaw (vertical) axes. When a control surface moves out of its streamlined  position (even slightly), moving air exerts a force against that surface. It is this force that the pilot feels on the controls.  

# Feel of the Airplane  

The ability to sense a flight condition, such as straight-and-level flight or a dive, without relying on instrumentation is often called  “feeling the airplane.” Examples of this “feel” may be sounds of the airflow across the airframe, vibrations felt through the   controls,  engine and propeller sounds and vibrations at various flight attitudes, and the sensations felt by the pilot through physical  accelerations.  

Humans sense “feel” through kinesthesis (the ability to sense movement through the body) and proprioception (unconscious  perception of movement and spatial orientation). These stimuli are detected by nerves and by the semicircular canals of the inner ear.  When properly developed, kinesthesis can provide the pilot with critical information about changes in the airplane’s direction and  speed; however, there are limits in kinesthetic sense when relied upon solely without visual information, as when flying in instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC). Sole reliance on the kinesthetic sense ultimately leads to disorientation and loss of aircraft control.  

Developing this “feel” takes time and exposure in a particular airplane. It only comes with dedicated practice at the various   flight  conditions so that a pilot’s senses are trained by the sounds, vibrations, and forces produced by the airplane. The following   are some  important examples:  

⦁  Rushing air creates a distinctive noise pattern and as the level of sound increases, it likely indicates that the      airplane’s   airspeed    increasing   and   that the pitch   attitude is   decreasing.   As   the noise decreases, the      airplane’s   pitch   attitude is   likely   increasing   and   its   airspeed   decreasing.   ⦁  The sound of the engine in cruise flight is different from that in a climb and different again when in a dive.    In fixed-pitch propeller airplanes, when the airplane’s pitch attitude increases, the engine sound   decreases   and as pitch attitude decreases, the engine  sound   increases.  ⦁  In a banked turn, the pilot is forced downward into the seat due to the resultant load factor. The increased G      force of a turn feels the same as the pull up from a dive, and the decreased G force from leveling out feels      the same as lowering the nose out of a climb.  

Sources   of   actual “feel” are very   important to   the pilot. This   actual feel is   the result of   acceleration,   which    simply   how   fast velocity  is changing. Acceleration describes the rate of change in both the magnitude and the direction of velocity. These accelerations impart  forces on the airplane and its occupants during flight. The pilot can sense vertical forces through pressure changes into the seat  or horizontal forces while being pushed from side to side in the seat if the airplane slips or skids. These forces need not be strong,  only perceptible by the pilot ,   to be useful. An accomplished pilot who has excellent “feel” for the airplane is able to detect   even the  smallest accelerations.  

The flight instructor should teach the difference between perceiving and reacting to sound, vibrations, and forces versus  merely noticing them. It is this increased understanding that contributes to developing a  " feel "   for the airplane. A pilot who develops   a “feel” for the airplane early in flight training is likely to have less difficulty during more advanced training.  

# Attitude Flying  

An airplane’s attitude is determined by the angular difference between a specific   axis and the natural horizon. A false horizon  can occur when the natural horizon is obscured or not readily apparent. This is an important concept because it requires the pilot to  develop a pictorial sense of this natural horizon. Pitch attitude is the angle formed between the airplane’s longitudinal axis, which  extends from the nose to the tail of the airplane, and the natural horizon. Bank attitude is the angle formed by the airplane’s  lateral axis, which extends from wingtip to wingtip, and the natural horizon.  [Figures 3-3A  and  3-3B]  Angular difference about the  airplane’s   vertical axis   (yaw)    an   attitude relative to   the airplane’s   direction   of   flight but not relative to   the natural horizon.

Figure 3-3.  (A)   Pitch   attitude is   the angle formed   between   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis, which   extends   from the nose to   tail of the  airplane, and the natural horizon. (B) Bank attitude is the angle formed by the airplane's lateral axis, which extends from wingtip to  wingtip, and the natural horizon.  

Controlling   an   airplane   requires   one   of   two   methods   to   determine   the   airplane’s   attitude   in   reference   to   the   horizon.   When   flying  “visually” in   visual meteorological conditions   (VMC),   a pilot uses their   eyes and   visually   references   the airplane’s   wings   and cowling  to   establish   the airplane’s   attitude to   the natural horizon   (a visible horizon).    no   visible horizon   can   be seen   due to   clouds, whiteouts,  haze over the ocean, night over a dark ocean, etc., it is IMC for practical and safety purposes.  [Figure 3-4]  When flying in IMC or  when cross-checking the visual references, the airplane’s attitude is controlled by the pilot referencing the airplane’s mechanical  or electronically - generated instruments to determine the airplane’s attitude in relation to the natural horizon.

Note: Yaw control is used to cancel out the effects of yaw - induced changes, such as adverse yaw and effects of the propeller.  

# Integrated Flight Instruction  

When introducing basic flight maneuvers to a beginning pilot, it is recommended that the “ i ntegrated” or “ c omposite” method of  flight instruction be used. This means the use of outside references and flight instruments to establish and maintain desired  flight attitudes and airplane performance. When beginning pilots use this technique, they achieve a more precise and competent  overall piloting ability. Although this method of airplane control may become second nature with experience, the beginning pilot  needs to make a determined effort to master the technique. In all cases, a pilot’s visual skills need to be sufficiently developed for   long-term, safe, and effective aircraft control.  [Figure 3-5]  

![](images/af02ae0d8538d918e3f49697be8e70f1960746fef38c302b865d60b795a52a6b.jpg)  
Figure 3-5.  Integrated flight instruction teaches pilots to use both external and instrument attitude references.  

The basic elements of integrated flight instruction are as follows:  

⦁  The pilot visually   controls   the airplane’s   attitude in   reference   outside to   the natural horizon.   Approximately     90   percent of   the pilot’s   attention   should   be devoted    outside visual references   and   scanning   for   airborne       traffic. The process of visually evaluating pitch and bank attitude comes from a continuous stream of      attitude information. When the pilot perceives that the attitude is other than desired, the pilot should make      precise, smooth, and accurate flight control corrections to return the airplane to the desired attitude.      Continuous visual checks of the outside references and immediate corrections made by the pilot minimize      the chance for the airplane to deviate from the desired heading, altitude, and flightpath.  

⦁  The airplane’s   attitude is   validated   by   referring    flight instruments   and   confirming   performance.    the       flight instruments   display   that the airplane’s   performance     need   of   correction,   the required   correction       needs to be determined and then precisely, smoothly, and accurately applied with reference to the natural      horizon.   The airplane’s   attitude and   performance   are then   rechecked   by   referring    flight instruments.   The       pilot then maintains the corrected attitude by reference to the natural horizon.  ⦁  The pilot should   monitor   the airplane’s   performance   by   briefly   checking   the flight instruments.   No   more       than   about 10   percent of   the pilot’s   attention   should   be inside the flight deck.   The pilot should   develop   the       skill to quickly analyze the appropriate flight instruments and then immediately return to the visual outside      references    control the airplane’s   attitude.  

The pilot should become familiar with the relationship between outside visual references to the natural horizon and the corresponding  flight   instrument   indications.   For   example,   a pitch   attitude   adjustment   may   require   a movement   of   the   pilot’s   reference   point   of  several inches in relation to the natural horizon but correspond to a seemingly insignificant movement of the reference bar on the  airplane’s   attitude   indicator.   Similarly,   a deviation   from   a desired   bank   angle,   which   is   obvious   when   referencing   the   airplane’s   wingtips   or   cowling   relative to   the natural horizon,   may   be imperceptible on   the airplane’s   attitude indicator    the beginner pilot.  

The most common error made by the beginner pilot is to make pitch or bank corrections while still looking inside. It is also common  for beginner pilots to fixate on the flight instruments—a conscious effort is required by them to return to outside visual references.  For the first several hours of instruction, flight instructors may choose to use flight instrument covers to develop a beginning   pilot’s   skill or to correct a pilot’s poor habit of fixating on instruments by forcing them to use outside visual references for aircraft control.  

The beginning pilot, not being familiar with the intricacies of flight by references to instruments, including such things as instrument  lag and gyroscopic precession, will invariably make excessive attitude corrections and end up “chasing the instruments.” Airplane  attitude by reference to the natural horizon, however, presents immediate and accurate indications many times larger than on any  instrument. The beginning pilot should understand that anytime airplane attitude by reference to the natural horizon cannot be  established or maintained, the situation has become a genuine emergency and that the use of integrated flight instruction does not  prepare pilots for flight in IMC.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

Straight-and-level flight is flight in which heading and altitude are maintained. The other fundamentals are derived as variations from  straight-and-level flight, and the need to form proper and effective skills in flying straight and level should be understood. The ability  to perform straight-and-level flight results from repetition and practice. A high level of skill results when the pilot perceives outside  references, takes mental snap shots of the flight instruments, and makes effective, timely, and proportional corrections from  unintentional slight turns, descents, and climbs.  

Straight-and-level flight is a matter of consciously fixing the relationship of a reference point on the airplane in relation to the natural  horizon.  [Figure 3-6]  The establishment of these reference points should be initiated on the ground as they depend on the pilot’s  seating position, height, and posture. The pilot should sit in a normal manner with the seat position adjusted, such that the pilot sees  adequately over the instrument panel while being able to fully depress the rudder pedals without straining or reaching.  

A flight instructor may use a dry erase marker or removable tape to make reference lines on the windshield or cowling to help the  beginner pilot establish visual reference points. Vertical reference lines are best established on the ground, such as when the airplane is  placed on a marked centerline, with the beginner pilot seated in proper position. Horizontal reference lines are best established with the  airplane in flight, such as during slow flight and cruise configurations. The horizon reference point is always the same, no matter what  altitude, since the point is always on the horizon, although the distance to the horizon will be further as altitude increases. There are  multiple horizontal reference lines due to varying pitch attitude requirements; however, these teaching aids are generally needed for  only a short period until the beginning pilot understands where and when to look while maneuvering  the airplane.  

# Straight Flight  

Maintaining a constant direction or heading is accomplished by visually checking the relationship of the airplane’s wingtips to the  natural horizon. Depending on whether the airplane is a high wing or low wing, both wingtips should be level and equally above or  below the natural horizon. Any necessary bank corrections are made with the pilot’s coordinated use of ailerons and rudder.  [Figure  3-7]  The pilot should understand that anytime the wings are banked, the airplane turns. The objective of straight flight is to detect and  correct small deviations, necessitating minor flight control corrections. The bank attitude information can also be obtained from a  quick scan of the attitude indicator (which shows the position of the airplane’s wings relative to the horizon) and the heading indicator  (which indicates if the airplane is off the desired heading).

Figure 3-7.  Wingtip reference for straight-and-level flight.  

It is possible to maintain straight flight by simply exerting the necessary pressure with the ailerons or rudder independently in the  desired direction of correction. However, the practice of using the ailerons and rudder independently is not correct and makes precise  control of the airplane difficult. The correct bank flight control movement requires the coordinated use of ailerons and rudder.  Straight-and-level flight requires almost no application of flight control pressures if the airplane is properly trimmed and the air is  smooth. For that reason, the pilot should not form the habit of unnecessarily moving the flight controls. The pilot needs to learn to  recognize when corrections are necessary and then to make a measured flight control response precisely, smoothly, and accurately.  

Pilots   may   tend   to   look   out to   one side continually,   generally   to   the left due to   the pilot’s   left seat position   and   consequently focus  attention in that direction. This not only gives a restricted angle from which the pilot is to observe but also causes the pilot to exert  unconscious pressure on the flight controls in that direction. It is also important that the pilot not fixate in any one direction and  continually   scan   outside the airplane,   not only   to   ensure that the airplane’s   attitude is   correct, but also   to   ensure that the pilot is  considering other factors for safe flight. Continually observing both wingtips has advantages other than being the only positive check  for leveling the wings. This includes looking for aircraft traffic, terrain and weather influences, and maintaining overall situational  awareness.  

Straight flight allows flying along a line. For outside references, the pilot selects a point on the horizon aligned with another point  ahead. If those two points stay in alignment, the airplane will track the line formed by the two points. A pilot can also hold a course in  VFR by tracking to a point in front of a compass or magnetic direction indicator, with only glances at the instrument or indicator to  ensure being on course. The reliance on a surface point does not work when flying over water or flat snow covered surfaces. In these  conditions, the pilot should rely on the magnetic heading indication.  

# Level Flight  

In learning to control the airplane in level flight, it is important that the pilot be taught to maintain a light touch on the flight controls  using fingers rather than the common problem of a tight-fisted palm wrapped around the flight controls. The pilot should exert only  enough pressure on the flight controls to produce the desired result. The pilot should learn to associate the apparent movement of the  references with the control pressures which produce attitude movement. As a result, the pilot can develop the ability to adjust the  change desired   in   the airplane’s   attitude by   the amount and   direction   of   pressures applied   to   the flight controls   without the   pilot  excessively referring to instrument or outside references for each minor correction.  

The pitch attitude for level flight is first obtained by the pilot being properly seated, selecting a point toward the airplane’s   nose as a  reference, and then keeping that reference point in a fixed position relative to the natural horizon.  [Figure 3-8]  The principles of  attitude flying require that the reference point to the natural horizon position should be cross-checked against the flight instruments to  determine if the pitch attitude is correct. If trending away from the desired altitude, the pitch attitude should be readjusted in relation  to the natural horizon and then the flight instruments crosschecked to determine if altitude is now being corrected or maintained. In  level flight maneuvers,   the terms   “increase the back   pressure”   or   “increase pitch   attitude”   implies   raising   the airplane’s   nose in  relation   to   the natural horizon   and   the terms   “decreasing   the pitch   attitude”   or   “decrease pitch   attitude”   means   lowering   the   nose in  relation    the natural horizon.   The pilot’s   primary   reference    the natural horizon.  

For   all practical purposes, the airplane’s   airspeed   remains   constant in   straight-and-level flight if the power setting is also constant.  Intentional airspeed changes, by increasing or decreasing the engine power, provide proficiency in maintaining straight-and-level  flight as the airplane’s   airspeed    changing.   Pitching   moments   may   also   be generated   by   extension   and   retraction   of   flaps,   landing  gear, and other drag producing devices, such as spoilers. Exposure to the effect of the various configurations should be covered in any  specific airplane checkout.  

# Common Errors  

A   common   error   of   a beginner   pilot is   attempting   to   hold   the wings   level by   only   observing   the airplane’s   nose.   Using   this   method,  the nose’s   short horizontal reference   line can   cause slight deviations   to   go   unnoticed.   However,   deviations   from   level flight   are easily  recognizable when   the pilot references   the wingtips   and,   as a result, the wingtips   should   be the pilot’s   primary   reference   for  maintaining level bank attitude. This technique also helps eliminate the potential for flying the airplane with one wing low and  correcting heading errors with the pilot holding opposite rudder pressure. A pilot with a bad habit of dragging one wing low and  compensating with opposite rudder pressure will have difficulty mastering other flight maneuvers.

Figure 3-8.  Nose reference for level flight.  

Common errors include:  

1. Attempting to use improper pitch and bank refeequent flights.  2. Forgetting the location of preselected reference points on subsequent flights.  3. Attempting to establish or correct airplane attitude using flight instruments rather than the natural horizon.  4. “Chasing” the flight instruments   rather   than   adhering    the principles of   attitude flying.   5. Mechanically pushing or pulling on the flight controls rather than exerting accurate and smooth pressure.  6. Not scanning outside the aircraft for other traffic and weather and terrain influences.  7. A tight palm grip on the flight controls resulting in a desensitized feeling of the hand and fingers.  8. Overcontrolling the airplane.  9. Habitually flying with one wing low or maintaining directional control using only the rudder control.  10. Failure to make timely and measured control inputs after a deviation from straight-and-level.  11. Inadequate attention to sensory inputs in developing feel for trence points on the airplane to establish attitude.  

# Trim Control  

Trim control surfaces are required to offset any constant flight control pressure inputs provided by the pilot. For example, elevator  trim is a typical trim in light GA airplanes and is used to null the pressure exerted by the pilot in order to maintain a particular pitch  attitude.  [Figure 3-9]  This provides an opportunity for the pilot to divert attention to other tasks.  

![](images/8a056d9aa14dd3a14bd9001432d754ca00717d2d571b9d78c422e813e1a7ac9e.jpg)  
Figure 3-9.  Elevator trim is used in airplanes to null the pressure exerted by the pilot on the pitch flight control.  

Because of their relatively low power, speed, and cost constraints, not all light airplanes have a complete set (elevator, rudder, and  aileron) of trim controls that are adjustable from inside the flight deck. Nearly all light airplanes are equipped with at least adjustable  elevator trim. As airplanes increase in power, weight, and complexity, flight deck adjustable trim systems for the rudder and aileron  may be available.  

In airplanes where multiple trim axes are available, the rudder should be trimmed first. Rudder, elevator, and then aileron should be  trimmed next in sequence. However, if the airspeed is varying, continuous attempts to trim the rudder and aileron produce  unnecessary pilot workload and distraction. Attempts to trim the rudder at varying airspeeds are impractical in many propeller  airplanes because of the built-in   compensation   for   the effect of   a propeller’s   left turning   tendencies. The correct procedure is   when   the  pilot has established a constant airspeed and pitch attitude, the pilot should then hold the wings level with aileron flight control  pressure while rudder control pressure is trimmed out. Finally, aileron trim should be adjusted to relieve any aileron flight control  pressure.  

A properly trimmed airplane is an indication of good piloting skills. Any control forces that the pilot feels should be a result of  deliberate flight control pressure inputs during a planned change in airplane attitude, not a result of forces being applied by the  airplane. A common trim control error is the tendency for the pilot to overcontrol the airplane with trim adjustments. Attempting to  fly the airplane with the trim is a common fault in basic flying technique even among experienced pilots. The airplane attitude should  be established first and held with the appropriate flight control pressures, and then the flight control pressures trimmed out so that the  airplane maintains the desired attitude without the pilot exerting flight control pressure.  

# Level Turns  

A   turn    initiated   by   banking   the wings   in   the desired   direction   of   the turn   through   the pilot’s   use of   the aileron   flight controls. Left  aileron flight control pressure causes the left wing to lower in relation to the pilot. Right aileron flight control pressure causes the  right wing to lower in relation to the pilot. In other words, to turn left, the pilot lowers the left wing with aileron by left stick. To turn  right, the pilot lowers the right wing with right stick. Depending on bank angle and airplane engineering, at many bank angles, the  airplane will continue to turn with ailerons neutralized. The sequence could be as follows:  

1.   Bank the airplane, adding either enough power or pitching up to compensate for the loss of vertical lift.  2.   Neutralize controls as necessary to stop bank from increasing and hold desired bank angle.  3.   Use the opposite stick (aileron) to return airplane to level.  4.   Neutralize the ailerons (along with either power or pitch reduction) for level flight.  [Figure 3-10]  

![](images/6edfc3aa84f53a1b8459f678c52db701dc313c3c44a671dadc730d465ab564cb.jpg)  
Figure 3-10.  Level turn to the left.  

A turn is the result of the following:  

⦁  The ailerons bank the wings and determine the rate of turn for a given airspeed. Lift is divided into both  vertical and horizontal lift components as a result of the bank. The horizontal component of lift moves the  airplane toward the banked direction.  

⦁  The elevator pitches the nose of the airplane up or down in relation to the pilot and perpendicular to the      wings. If the pilot does not add power, and there is sufficient airspeed margin, the pilot needs to slightly      increase the pitch to increase wing lift enough to replace the wing lift being diverted into turning force so      as to maintain the current altitude.  

⦁  The vertical fin on an airplane does not produce lift. Rather the vertical fin on an airplane is a stabilizing      surface and   produces   no   lift if   the airplane is   flying   straight ahead.   The vertical fin’s   purpose is    keep   the     aft end of the airplane behind the front end.  

⦁  The throttle provides thrust, which may be used for airspeed control and to vary the radius of the turn.  

⦁  The pilot uses the rudder    offset any   adverse yaw   developed   by   wing’s   differential lift and   the  engine/propeller. The rudder does not turn the airplane. The rudder is used to maintain coordinated flight.  

⦁  Shallow turns—bank angle is approximately 20° or   less.   This   shallow   bank    such   that the inherent lateral  stability of the airplane slowly levels the wings unless aileron pressure in the desired direction of bank is  held by the pilot to maintain the bank angle.  ⦁  Medium turns—result from a degree of bank between approximately   $20^{\circ}$    and    $45^{\circ}$  . At medium bank angles,     the airplane’s   inherent lateral stability   does not return   the wings    level flight. As   a result, the airplane       tends to remain at a constant bank angle without any flight control pressure held by the pilot. The pilot      neutralizes the aileron flight control pressure to maintain the bank.  ⦁  Steep turns—result from a degree of bank of approximately   $45^{\circ}$   or   more.   The airplane continues in   the       direction of the bank even with neutral flight controls unless the pilot provides opposite flight control      aileron pressure to prevent the airplane from overbanking. The actual amount of opposite flight control      pressure used depends on various factors, such as bank angle and airspeed.  

When an airplane is flying straight and level, the total lift is acting perpendicular to the wings and to the  e arth. As the airplane is  banked into a turn, total lift is the resultant of two components: vertical and horizontal.  [Figure 3-11]  The vertical lift component  continues to act perpendicular to the  e arth and opposes gravity. The horizontal lift component acts parallel to the  e arth’s surface  opposing centrifugal force. These two lift components act at right angles to each other, causing the resultant total lifting force to act  perpendicular to the banked wing of the airplane. It is the horizontal lift component that begins to turn the airplane and not the rudder.  

![](images/f351a5ddf6f46bcd0918006117915c458ceac8bc1b91c3640eb4ce35b11483f2.jpg)  
Figure 3-11 .   When the airplane is banked into a turn, total lift is the resultant of two components: vertical and horizontal.  

In constant altitude, constant airspeed turns, it is necessary to increase the AOA of the wing when rolling into the turn by increasing  back pressure on the elevator, as well to add power countering the loss of speed due to increased drag. This is required because total  lift has divided into vertical and horizontal components of lift. In order to maintain altitude, the total lift (since total lift acts  perpendicular to the wing) needs to be increased to meet the vertical component of lift requirements (to balance weight and load  factor) for level flight.  

The purpose of the rudder in a turn is to coordinate the turn. As lift increases, so does drag. When the pilot deflects the ailerons to  bank the airplane, both lift and drag are increased on the rising wing and, simultaneously, lift and drag are decreased on the lowering  wing.  [Figure 3-12]  This increased drag on the rising wing and decreased drag on the lowering wing results in the airplane yawing  opposite to the direction of turn. To counteract this adverse yaw, rudder pressure is applied simultaneously with the aileron deflection  in the desired direction of turn. This action is required to produce a coordinated turn. Coordinated flight is an important part of  airplane control. Situations can develop when a pilot maintains certain uncoordinated flight control deflections, which create the  potential for a spin. This is especially hazardous when operating at low altitudes, such as when operating in the airport traffic pattern.

Figure 3-12.  The rudder opposes adverse yaw to help coordinate the turn.  

During uncoordinated flight, the pilot may feel that they are being pushed sideways toward the outside or inside of the turn.  [Figure  3-13]  The pilot feels pressed toward the outside of a turn during a skid and feels pressed toward the inside of a turn during a slip. The  ability   to   sense a skid   or   slip    developed   over   time and   as the “feel” of   flying   develops,   a pilot should   become highly   sensitive to a  slip or skid without undue reliance on the flight instruments.

Figure 3-13.  Indications of a slip and skid.  

# Turn Radius  

To understand the relationship between airspeed, bank, and radius of turn, it should be noted that the rate of turn at any given true  airspeed depends on the horizontal lift component. The horizontal lift component varies in proportion to the amount of bank.  Therefore, the rate of turn at a given airspeed increases as the angle of bank is increased. On the other hand, when a turn is made at a  higher airspeed at a given bank angle, the inertia is greater and the horizontal lift component required for the turn is greater, causing  the turning rate to become slower.  [Figure 3-14]  Therefore, at a given angle of bank, a higher airspeed makes the radius of turn larger  because the airplane turns at a slower rate.  

![](images/afc64ba632ead990b5ec9bab0455454d222ddf95a11854ae9b0184fba2078b07.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.  Angle of bank and airspeed regulate rate and radius of turn.  

As the radius of the turn becomes smaller, a significant difference develops between the airspeed of the inside wing and the airspeed  of the outside wing. The wing on the outside of the turn travels a longer path than the inside wing, yet both complete their respective  paths in the same unit of time.  

Therefore, the outside wing travels at a faster airspeed than the inside wing and, as a result, it develops more lift. This creates  an overbanking tendency that needs to be controlled by the use of opposite aileron when the desired bank angle is reached.  [Figure  3-15]  Because the outboard wing is developing more lift, it also produces more drag. The drag causes a slight slip during steep turns  that should be corrected by use of the rudder.

Figure 3-15.  Overbanking tendency.  

# Establishing a Turn  

On most light single-engine airplanes, the top surface of the engine cowling is fairly flat, and its horizontal surface to the natural  horizon provides a reasonable indication for initially setting the degree of bank angle.  [Figure 3-16]  The pilot should then cross­ check the flight instruments to verify that the correct bank angle has been achieved. Information obtained from the attitude indicator  shows the angle of the wing in relation to the horizon.  

![](images/084b77bbe11e5d1aae9ee306f18ddd38962e1490cd3f37b7cddce7f3b4744caa.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.  Visual reference for angle of bank.  

The pilot’s seating position in the airplane is important as it affects the interpretation of outside visual references. A common  problem is that a pilot may lean away from the turn in an attempt to remain in an upright position in relation to the horizon.  This should be corrected immediately if the pilot is to properly learn to use visual references.  [Figure 3-17]  

![](images/88841e8d1b59ddf40b3183dcb414fcf8b795191e0844ec1c2e8b86d01d159877.jpg)  
Figure 3-17.  Correct and incorrect posture while seated in the airplane.  

Because most airplanes have side-by-side seating,   a pilot does not sit on   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis,   which    where the airplane  rotates in roll. The pilot sits slightly off to one side, typically the left, of the longitudinal axis. Due to parallax error, this makes the  nose of the airplane appear to rise when making a left turn (due to pilot lowering in relation to the longitudinal axis) and the nose of  the airplane appear to descend when making right turns (due to pilot elevating in relation to the longitudinal axis).  [Figure 3-18]  

Beginning pilots should not use large aileron and rudder control inputs. This is because large control inputs produce rapid roll rates  and allow little time for the pilot to evaluate and make corrections. Smaller flight control inputs result in slower roll rates and provide  for more time to accurately complete the necessary pitch and bank corrections.

Some additional considerations for initiating turns are the following:  ⦁  If   the airplane’s   nose starts    move before the bank   starts,   the rudder    being   applied   too   soon.  

⦁  If the bank starts before the nose starts turning or the nose moves in the opposite direction, the rudder is      being applied too late.  

⦁  If the nose moves up or down when entering a bank, excessive or insufficient elevator back pressure is      being applied.  

After the bank has been established, all flight control pressures applied to the ailerons and rudder may be relaxed or adjusted,  depending on the established bank angle, to compensate for the airplane’s inherent stability or overbanking tendencies. The airplane  should remain at the desired bank angle with the proper application of aileron pressure. If the desired bank angle is shallow, the pilot  needs to maintain a small amount of aileron pressure into the direction of bank including rudder to compensate for yaw effects. For  medium bank angles, the ailerons and rudder should be neutralized. Steep bank angles require opposite aileron and rudder to prevent  the bank from steepening.  

Back pressure on the elevator should not be relaxed as the vertical component of lift should be maintained if altitude is to be  maintained. Throughout the turn, the pilot should reference the natural horizon, scan for aircraft traffic, and occasionally crosscheck  the flight instruments to verify performance. A reduction in airspeed is the result of increased drag but is generally not significant for  shallow bank angles. In steeper turns, additional power may be required to maintain airspeed. If altitude is not being maintained  during the turn, the pitch attitude should be corrected in relation to the natural horizon and cross-checked with the flight instruments  to verify performance.  

Steep turns require accurate, smooth, and timely flight control inputs. Minor corrections for pitch attitude are accomplished with  proportional elevator back pressure while the bank angle is held constant with the ailerons. However, during steep turns, it is not  uncommon for a pilot to allow the nose to get excessively low resulting in a significant loss in altitude in a very short period of time.  The recovery sequence requires that the pilot first reduce the angle of bank with coordinated use of opposite aileron and rudder and  then increase the pitch attitude by increasing elevator back pressure. If recovery from an excessively nose-low, steep bank condition  is attempted by use of the elevator only, it only causes a steepening of the bank and unnecessary stress on the airplane. Steep turn  performance can be improved by an appropriate application of power to overcome the increase in drag. Depending on the purpose of  a steep turn and the magnitude of control force needed, trimming additional elevator back pressure as the bank angle goes beyond   $30^{\circ}$    may assist the pilot during the turn.  

Since the airplane continues turning as long as there is any bank, the rollout from the turn should be started before reaching the  desired heading. The amount of lead required to rollout on the desired heading depends on the degree of bank used in the turn. A rule  of thumb is to lead by one-half the angle of bank. For example, if the bank is   $30^{\circ}$  , lead the rollout by   $15^{\circ}$  . The rollout from a turn is  similar to the roll-in except the flight controls are applied in the opposite direction. Aileron and rudder are applied in the direction of  the rollout or toward the high wing. As the angle of bank decreases, the elevator pressure should be relaxed as necessary to maintain  altitude. As the wings become level, the flight control pressures should be smoothly relaxed so that the controls are neutralized as the  airplane returns to straight-and-level flight. If trim was used, such as during a steep turn, forward elevator pressure may be required  until the trim can be adjusted. As the rollout is being completed, attention should be given to outside visual references, as well as the  flight instruments to determine that the wings are being leveled and the turn stopped.  

Because the elevator and ailerons are on one control, practice is required to ensure that only the intended pressure is applied to the  intended flight control. For example, a beginner pilot is likely to unintentionally add pressure to the pitch control when the only bank  was intended. This cross-coupling may be diminished or enhanced by the design of the flight controls; however, practice is the  appropriate measure for smooth, precise, and accurate flight control inputs. For example, diving when turning right and climbing  when turning left in airplanes is common with stick controls, because the arm tends to rotate from the elbow joint, which induces a  secondary arc control motion if the pilot is not extremely careful. Likewise, lowering the nose is likely to induce a right turn, and  raising the nose to climb tends to induce a left turn. These actions would apply for a pilot using the right hand to move the stick.  Airplanes with a control wheel may be less prone to these inadvertent actions, depending on control positions and pilot seating. In any  case, the pilot should retain the proper sight picture of the nose following the horizon, whether up, down, left ,   or right and  isolate undesired motion.  

Common errors in level turns are:  

1. Failure to adequately clear in the direction of turn for aircraft traffic.  2. Gaining or losing altitude during the turn.  3. Not holding the desired bank angle constant.  4. Attempting to execute the turn solely by instrument reference.  5. Leaning away from the direction of the turn while seated.  6. Insufficient feel for the airplane as evidenced by the inability to detect slips or skids without flight instruments.  7. Attempting    maintain   a constant bank   angle by   referencing   only   the airplane’s   nose.   8. Making skidding flat turns to avoid banking the airplane.  9. Holding excessive rudder in the direction of turn.  10. Gaining proficiency in turns in only one direction.  11. Failure to coordinate the controls.  

# Climbs and Climbing Turns  

When an airplane enters a climb, excess lift needs to be developed to overcome the weight or gravity. This requirement to develop  more lift results in more induced drag, which either results in decreased airspeed or an increased power setting to maintain a  minimum airspeed in the climb. An airplane can only sustain a climb when there is sufficient thrust to offset increased drag; therefore,  climb rate is limited by the excess thrust available.  

The pilot should know the engine power settings, natural horizon pitch attitudes, and flight instrument indications that produce the  following types of climb:  

⦁  Normal climb—performed at an airspeed recommended by the airplane manufacturer. Normal climb speed       generally   higher   than   the airplane’s   best rate of   climb.   The additional airspeed   provides for   better   engine       cooling, greater control authority, and better visibility over the nose of the airplane. Normal climb is      sometimes referred to as cruise climb.  ⦁  Best rate of climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  —produces the most altitude gained over a given amount of time. This airspeed is      typically used when initially departing a runway without obstructions until it is safe to transition to a normal      or cruise climb configuration.  ⦁  Best angle of climb   $\left(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$  —performed at an airspeed that produces the most altitude gain over a given      horizontal distance. The best angle of climb results in a steeper climb, although the airplane takes more      time to reach the same altitude than it would at best rate of climb airspeed. The best angle of climb is used       to clear obstacles, such as a strand of trees, after takeoff.  [Figure 3-19]  

It should be noted that as altitude increases, the airspeed for best angle of climb increases and the airspeed for best rate of climb  decreases. Performance   charts   contained   in   the Airplane Flight Manual or   Pilot’s   Operating   Handbook   (AFM/POH)   should   be  consulted to ensure that the correct airspeed is used for the desired climb profile at the given environmental conditions. There is a  point at which the best angle of climb airspeed and the best rate of climb airspeed intersect. This occurs at the absolute ceiling at  which the airplane is incapable of climbing any higher.  [Figure 3-20]

# Establishing a Climb  

A straight climb is entered by gently increasing back pressure on the elevator flight control to the pitch attitude referencing the  airplane’s   nose to   the natural horizon   while simultaneously   increasing   engine power   to   the climb   power   setting.   The wingtips   should  be referenced in maintaining the climb attitude while cross-checking the flight instruments to verify performance. In many airplanes,  as power    increased,   an   increase in   slipstream   over   the horizontal stabilizer   causes the airplane’s   pitch   attitude to   increase more than  desired. The pilot should be prepared for slipstream effects but also for the effect of changing airspeed and changes in lift. The pilot  should be prepared to use the required flight control pressures to achieve the desired pitch attitude.  

If a climb is started from cruise flight, the airspeed gradually decreases as the airplane enters a stabilized climb attitude. The thrust  required to maintain straight-and-level flight at a given airspeed is not sufficient to maintain the same airspeed in a climb. Increase  drag in a climb stems from increased lift demands made upon the wing to increase altitude. Climbing requires an excess of lift over  that necessary to maintain level flight. Increased lift will generate more induced drag. That increase in induced drag is why more  power is needed and why a sustained climb requires an excess of thrust.  

For practical purposes gravity or weight is a constant. A vector diagram shows why more lift is necessary during a climb, as the  vertical component of lift generated from the wings is no longer perpendicular to the wings and adds to drag. The total vertical force  is increased by adding a vertical component of thrust from the powerplant, and the power should be advanced to the recommended  climb power. On airplanes equipped with an independently controllable-pitch propeller, this requires advancing the propeller control  prior to increasing engine power. Some airplanes may be equipped with cowl flaps to facilitate effective engine cooling. The position  of   the cowl flaps   should   be set to   ensure cylinder   head   temperatures remain   within   the manufacturer’s   specifications.  

Engines that are normally aspirated experience a reduction of power as altitude is gained. As altitude increases, air density decreases,  which results in a reduction of power. The indications show a reduction in revolutions per minute (rpm) for airplanes with fixed pitch  propellers; airplanes that are equipped with controllable propellers show a decrease in manifold pressure. The pilot should reference  the engine instruments to ensure that climb power is being maintained and that pressures and temperatures are within the  manufacturer’s   limits.   As   power   decreases   in   the   climb,   the   pilot   continually   advances   the   throttle   or   power   lever   to   maintain  specified climb settings.  

The pilot should understand propeller effects during a climb and when using high power settings . The propeller in most airplanes  rotates clockwise when seen from the pilot’s position. As pitch attitude is increased, the center of thrust from the propeller moves to  the right and becomes asymmetrical. This asymmetric condition is often called “P-factor.” This is the result of the increased AOA of  the descending propeller blade, which is the right side of the propeller disc when seen from the flight deck. As the center of propeller  thrust moves to the right, a left turning yawing moment moves the nose of the airplane to the left. This is compensated by the pilot  through right rudder pressure. In addition, torque that acts opposite to the direction of propeller rotation causes the airplane to roll to  the left. Under these conditions, torque and P-factor cause the airplane to roll and yaw to the left. To counteract this, right rudder and  aileron flight control pressures should be used. During the initial practice of climbs, this may initially seem awkward; however, after  some experience the correction for propeller effects becomes instinctive.  

As the airspeed decreases during the climb’s establishment, the airplane’s pitch attitude tends to lower unless the pilot increases the  elevator flight control pressure. Nose-up elevator trim should be used so that the pitch attitude can be maintained without the pilot  holding back elevator pressure. Throughout the climb, since the power should be fixed at the climb power setting, airspeed is  controlled by the use of elevator pressure. The pitch attitude to the natural horizon determines if the pitch attitude is correct and  should be cross-checked to the flight instruments to verify climb performance.  [Figure 3-21]  

![](images/88a1a328430075a38b1f4132de50241fe61f3e712066d69b5804821a376f1a79.jpg)  
Figure 3-21.  Climb indications.  

To return to straight-and-level flight from a climb, it is necessary to begin leveling-off prior to reaching the desired altitude. Level-off  should begin at approximately 10 percent of the rate of climb. For example, if the airplane is climbing at 500 feet per minute (fpm),  leveling off should begin 50 feet prior to reaching the desired altitude. The pitch attitude should be decreased smoothly and slowly to  allow for the airspeed to increase. A loss of altitude may result if the pitch attitude is changed too rapidly without allowing the  airspeed to increase proportionately.  

After the airplane is established in level flight at a constant altitude, climb power should be retained temporarily so that the airplane  accelerates to the cruise airspeed. When the airspeed reaches the desired cruise airspeed, the throttle setting and the propeller control,  if equipped, should be set to the cruise power setting and the airplane re-trimmed.  

# Climbing Turns  

In the performance of climbing turns, the following factors should be considered:  

⦁  With a constant power setting, the same pitch attitude and airspeed cannot be maintained in a bank as in a      straight climb due to the increase in the total lift required. The airplane climbs at a slightly shallower climb      angle because some of the lift is being used to turn the airplane.  ⦁  Steep bank angles significantly decreases the rate of climb. The pilot should establish and maintain an      appropriate constant bank during the turn.  ⦁  The pilot should maintain a constant airspeed and constant rate of turn in both right and left turns. The      coordination of all flight controls is a primary factor.  

All the factors that affect the airplane during level constant-altitude turns affect the airplane during climbing turns. Compensation for  the inherent stability of the airplane, overbanking tendencies, adverse yaw, propeller effects, reduction of the vertical component of  lift, and increased drag needs to be managed by the pilot through the manipulation of the flight controls.  

Climbing turns may be established by entering the climb first and then banking into the turn or climbing and turning simultaneously.  During climbing turns, as in any turn, the loss of vertical lift should be compensated by an increase in pitch attitude. When a turn is  coupled with a climb, the additional drag and reduction in the vertical component of lift need to be further compensated for by an  additional increase in elevator back pressure. When turns are simultaneous with a climb, it is most effective to limit the turns to  shallow bank angles. This provides for an efficient rate of climb. If a medium or steep banked turn is used, climb performance is  degraded or possibly non-existent.  

Common errors in the performance of climbs and climbing turns are:  

1. Attempting to establish climb pitch attitude by primarily referencing the airspeed indicator and chasing the airspeed.  2. Applying elevator pressure too aggressively resulting in an excessive climb angle.  3. Inadequate or inappropriate rudder pressure during climbing turns.  4. Allowing the airplane to yaw during climbs usually due to inadequate right rudder pressure.  5. Fixation   on   the airplane’s   nose during   straight climbs,   resulting    climbing   with   one wing   low.   6. Initiating a climbing turn without coordinated use of flight controls, resulting in no turn and a climb with one wing low.  7. Improper coordination resulting in a slip that counteracts the rate of climb, resulting in little or no altitude gain.  8. Inability to keep pitch and bank attitude constant during climbing turns.  9. Attempting    exceed   the airplane’s   climb   capability.   10. Using excessive forward elevator pressure during level-off resulting in a loss of altitude or excessive low G-force.  

# Descents and Descending Turns  

When an airplane enters a descent, its attitude changes from level flight to flight with a descent profile.  [Figure   $_{3-22J}$  In a descent,  weight no longer acts solely perpendicular to the flightpath. Since induced drag is decreased as lift is reduced in order to descend,  excess thrust will provide higher airspeeds. The weight/gravity force is about the same. This causes an increase in total thrust and a  power reduction is required to balance the forces if airspeed is to be maintained.  

![](images/56034384123e64d3a7eb585bfb833c3011d5570e574adc80b113e9924c3566f6.jpg)  
Figure 3-22.  Descent indications.  

The pilot should know the engine power settings, natural horizon pitch attitudes, and flight instrument indications that produce the  following types of descents:  

⦁  Partial power descent—the normal method of losing altitude is to descend with partial power. This is often      termed cruise or en route descent. The airspeed and power setting recommended by the AFM/POH for      prolonged descent should be used. The target descent rate should be 500 fpm. The desired airspeed, pitch      attitude, and power combination should be preselected and kept constant.  ⦁  Descent at minimum safe airspeed—a nose-high, power-assisted descent condition principally used      for clearing obstacles during a landing approach to a short runway. The airspeed used for this descent      condition is recommended by the AFM/POH and is normally no greater than 1.3 VSO. Some characteristics      of the minimum safe airspeed descent are a steeper-than-normal descent angle, and the excessive power      that may   be required    produce   acceleration   at low   airspeed   should   “mushing” and/or   an   excessive rate of       descent be allowed to develop.  ⦁  Emergency descent—some airplanes have a specific procedure for rapidly losing altitude. The AFM/POH      specifies the procedure. In general, emergency descent procedures are high drag, high airspeed procedures      requiring a specific airplane configuration (such as power to idle, propellers forward, landing gear      extended, and flaps retracted), and a specific emergency descent airspeed. Emergency descent maneuvers      often include turns.  

# Glides  

A glide is a basic maneuver in which the airplane loses altitude in a controlled descent with little or no engine power. Forward motion  is maintained by gravity pulling the airplane along an inclined path, and the descent rate is controlled by the pilot balancing the forces  of gravity and lift. To level off from a partial power descent using a 1,000 feet per minute descent rate, the pilot should use 10 percent  (100 feet in this example) as the distance above the desired level-off altitude to begin raising the nose and adding power to stop the  descent and maintain airspeed.  

Although glides are directly related to the practice of power - off accuracy landings, they have a specific operational purpose in normal  landing approaches, and forced landings after engine failure. Therefore, it is necessary that they be performed more subconsciously  than other maneuvers because most of the time during their execution, the pilot will be giving full attention to details other than the  mechanics of performing the maneuver. Since glides are usually performed relatively close to the ground, accuracy of their execution  and the formation of proper technique and habits are of special importance.  

The glide ratio of an airplane is the distance the airplane travels in relation to the altitude it loses. For example, if an airplane travels  10,000 feet forward while descending 1,000 feet, its glide ratio is 10 to 1.  

The best glide airspeed is used to maximize the distance flown. This airspeed is important when a pilot is attempting to fly during an  engine failure. The best airspeed for gliding is one at which the airplane travels the greatest forward distance for a given loss of  altitude in still air. This best glide airspeed occurs at the highest lift-to-drag ratio (L/D).  [Figure   $3–23J$  When gliding at airspeed  above or below the best glide airspeed, drag increases. Any change in the gliding airspeed results in a proportional change in the  distance flown.  [Figure 3-24]  As the glide airspeed is increased or decreased from the best glide airspeed, the glide ratio is lessened.  

![](images/676b2ce5c753489505cb7f708cc35d792571116d556b67de80d0db88fea67042.jpg)  

![](images/fb9d17ad413638706ed2c7d4963359380f9049f7d47a7fdd3501ec834697a7d0.jpg)  
Figure 3-24.  Best glide speed provides the greatest forward distance  

Variations in weight do not affect the glide angle provided the pilot uses the proper airspeed. Since it is the L/D ratio that determines  the distance the airplane can glide, weight does not affect the distance flown; however, a heavier airplane needs to fly at a higher  airspeed to obtain the same glide ratio. For example, if two airplanes having the same L/D ratio but different weights start a glide  from the same altitude, the heavier airplane gliding at a higher airspeed arrives at the same touchdown point in a shorter time. Both  airplanes cover the same distance, only the lighter airplane takes a longer time.  

Since the highest glide ratio occurs at maximum L/D, certain considerations should be given for drag-producing components of the  airplane, such as flaps, landing gear, and cowl flaps. When drag increases, a corresponding decrease in pitch attitude is required to  maintain airspeed. As the pitch is lowered, the glide path steepens and reduces the distance traveled. To maximize the distance  traveled during a glide, all drag-producing components need to be eliminated if possible.  

Wind affects the gliding distance. With a tailwind, the airplane glides farther because of the higher groundspeed. Conversely, with a  headwind, the airplane does not glide as far because of the slower groundspeed. This is important for a pilot to understand and  manage when dealing with engine-related emergencies and any subsequent forced landing.  

During powered operations, the airplane design compensates for the effects of p-factor and propeller slipstream. While these effects  disappear during a glide, the design compensation remains. During glides, it is likely that slight left rudder pressure will be required  to maintain coordinated flight. In addition, the pilot needs to use greater deflection of the flight controls due to the relatively slow  airflow over the control surfaces.  

Minimum sink speed is used to maximize the time that the airplane remains in flight. It results in the airplane losing altitude at the  lowest rate. Minimum sink speed occurs at a lower airspeed than the best glide speed. Flight at the minimum sink airspeed results in  less distance traveled. Minimum sink speed is useful in flight situations where time in flight is more important than distance flown. An  example is ditching an airplane at sea. Minimum sink speed is not an often published airspeed but generally is a few knots less than  best glide speed.  

In an emergency, such as an engine failure, attempting to apply elevator back pressure to stretch a glide back to the runway is likely to  lead the airplane landing short and may even lead to loss of control if the airplane stalls. This leads to a cardinal rule of airplane  flying: The pilot should   not attempt to   “stretch” a glide by   applying   back-elevator pressure and reducing the airspeed below the  airplane’s   recommended   best glide speed.   The purpose of   pitch   control during   the glide is   to   maintain   the maximum   L/D,   which   may  require fore or aft flight control pressure to maintain best glide airspeed.  

To enter a glide, the pilot should close the throttle and, if equipped, advance the propeller lever forward. With back pressure on the  elevator flight control, the pilot should maintain altitude until the airspeed decreases to the recommended best glide speed. In most  airplanes, as power is reduced, propeller slipstream decreases over the horizontal stabilizer, which decreases the tail-down force, and  the airplane’s   nose tends   to   lower   immediately.   To   keep   pitch   attitude constant after   a power   change,   the pilot should   counteract the  pitch down with a simultaneous increase in elevator back pressure. This point is particularly important for fast airplanes as they do  not readily lose their airspeed—any   slight deviation   of   the airplane’s   nose downwards   results   in   an   immediate increase in   airspeed.   Once the airspeed has dissipated to best glide speed, the pitch attitude should be set to maintain that airspeed. This should be done  with reference to the natural horizon and with a quick reference to the flight instruments. When the airspeed has stabilized, the  airplane should be trimmed to eliminate any flight control pressures held by the pilot. Precision is required in maintaining the best  glide airspeed if the benefits are to be realized.  

A stabilized, power-off descent at the best glide speed is often referred to as normal glide. The beginning pilot should memorize the  airplane’s   attitude and   speed   with   reference   to   the natural horizon   and   note the sounds   made by   the air   passing   over   the airplane’s   structure, forces on the flight controls, and the feel of the airplane. Initially, the learner may be unable to recognize slight variations in  airspeed and angle of bank by vision or by the pressure required on the flight controls. The instructor should point out that an increase  in sound levels denotes increasing speed, while a decrease in sound levels indicates decreasing speed. When a sound level change is  perceived, the learner should cross-check the visual and pressure references. The learner should use all three airspeed references  (sound, visual, and pressure) consciously until experience is gained, and then remain alert to any variation in attitude, feel, or sound.  

After a solid comprehension of the normal glide is attained, the learner should be instructed in the differences between normal and  abnormal glides. Abnormal glides are those glides conducted at speeds other than the best glide speed. Glide airspeeds that are too  slow or too fast may result in the airplane not being able to make the intended landing spot, flat approaches, hard touchdowns,  floating, overruns, and possibly stalls and an accident.  

# Gliding Turns  

The absence of the propeller slipstream, , p-factor, loss of effectiveness of the various flight control surfaces at lower airspeeds, and  designed-in aerodynamic corrections complicate the task of flight control coordination in comparison to powered flight for the  learner. These principles should be thoroughly explained to the learner by the flight instructor.  

Three elements in gliding turns that tend to force the nose down and increase glide speed are:  

1. Decrease in lift due to the direction of the lifting force.  2. Excessive rudder inputs as a result of reduced flight control pressures.  3. The normal stability and inherent characteristics of the airplane to nose-down with the power off.  

These three factors make it necessary to use more back pressure on the elevator than is required for a straight glide or a level turn, and  they have an effect on control coordination. The rudder compensates for yawing tendencies when rolling in or out of a gliding turn;  however, the required rudder pedal pressures are reduced as a result of the reduced forces acting on the control surfaces. A learner  may apply excessive rudder pedal pressures based on experience with powered flight. This overcontrol of the aircraft may cause slips  and skids and result in potentially hazardous flight control conditions.  

Some examples of this hazard are:  

⦁  A low-level gliding steep turn during an engine failure emergency. If the rudder is excessively deflected in  the direction of the bank while the pilot is increasing elevator back pressure in an attempt to retain altitude,  the situation can rapidly turn into an unrecoverable spin.  

⦁  During a power-off landing approach. The pilot depresses the rudder pedal with excessive pressure that  leads to increased lift on the outside wing, banking the airplane in the direction of the rudder deflection.  The pilot may improperly apply the opposite aileron to prevent the bank from increasing while applying  elevator back pressure. If allowed to progress, this situation may result in a fully developed cross-control  condition. A stall in this situation almost certainly results in a rapid and unrecoverable spin.  

Level-off from a glide is really two different maneuvers depending on the type of glide:  

⦁  First, in the event of a complete power failure, the best glide speed should be held until necessary to  reconfigure for the landing. The pilot should plan for a steeper approach than usual. A 10 percent lead (100  feet if the descent rate is 1,000 feet per minute) factor should be sufficient to slow the descent before  landing.  

⦁  Second, in the case of simulated power failure training, power should be applied as the 10 percent lead      value appears on the altimeter. This allows a slow but positive power application to maintain or increase      airspeed while the pilot raises the nose to stop the descent and re-trims the airplane as necessary.  

The level-off   from   a practice glide should   be started   before reaching   the desired   altitude because of   the airplane’s   downward   inertia.   The amount of lead depends on the rate of descent and the desired airspeed upon completion of the level off. For example, assume the  aircraft is in a 500 fpm rate of descent, and the desired final airspeed is higher than the glide speed. The altitude lead should begin at  approximately 100 feet above the target altitude. At the lead point, power should be increased to the appropriate level flight cruise  power   setting.   The airplane’s   nose tends   to   rise as airspeed   and   power   increase,   and   the pilot should   smoothly   control the pitch  attitude such that the level-off is completed at the desired altitude and airspeed. When recovery is being made from a gliding turn to a  normal glide, the back pressure on the elevator control, which was applied during the turn, needs to be decreased or the airplane may  pitch up and experience a loss of airspeed. This error requires considerable attention and conscious control adjustment to re-establish  a normal glide airspeed.  

Common errors in the performance of descents and descending turns are:  

1. Failure to adequately clear for aircraft traffic in the turn direction or descent.  2. Inadequate elevator back pressure during glide entry resulting in an overly steep glide.  3. Failure to slow the airplane to approximate glide speed prior to lowering pitch attitude.  4. Attempting to establish/maintain a normal glide solely by reference to flight instruments.  5. Inability to sense changes in airspeed through sound and feel.  6. Inability to stabilize the glide (chasing the airspeed indicator).  7. Attempting    “stretch” the glide by   applying   back-elevator pressure.  8. Skidding or slipping during gliding turns and not recognizing the difference in rudder forces with and without power.  9. Failure to lower pitch attitude during gliding turn entry resulting in a decrease in airspeed.  10. Excessive rudder pressure during recovery from gliding turns.  11. Inadequate pitch control during recovery from straight glide.  12. Cross-controlling during gliding turns near the ground.  13. Failure to maintain constant bank angle during gliding turns.  

# Chapter Summary  

The four fundamental maneuvers of straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs, and descents are the foundation of basic airmanship.  Effort and continued practice are required to master the fundamentals. It is important that a pilot consider the six motions of flight:  bank, pitch, yaw and horizontal, vertical, and lateral displacement. In order for an airplane to fly from one location to another, it  pitches, banks, and yaws while it moves over and above, in relationship to the ground, to reach its destination. The airplane should be  treated as an aerodynamic vehicle that is subject to rigid aerodynamic laws. A pilot needs to understand and apply the principles of  flight in order to control an airplane with the greatest margin of mastery and safety.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 4: Energy Management: Mastering Altitude and Airspeed Control  

# Introduction  

This   chapter    all about managing   the airplane’s   altitude and   airspeed   using   an   energy-centered approach. Energy management can  be defined   as the process   of   planning,   monitoring,   and   controlling   altitude and   airspeed   targets in   relation   to   the airplane’s energy  state in order to:  

1.   Attain and maintain desired vertical flightpath-airspeed profiles.  2.   Detect, correct ,  and prevent unintentional altitude-airspeed deviations from the desired energy state.  3.   Prevent irreversible deceleration and/or sink rate that results in a crash.  

# Importance of Energy Management  

Learning to manage the airplane’s energy in the form  of  altitude and airspeed is critical for all new pilots. Energy management is essential for effectively achieving and maintaining desired vertical flight path and airspeed profiles ,   (e.g. ,   constant airspeed climb)  and for transitioning from one profile to another during flight ,  (e.g. ,  leveling off from a descent).  

Proper energy management is also critical to flight safety. Mistakes in managing the airplane’s energy state can be deadly.  M ismanagement of mechanical energy (altitude and/or airspeed) is a contributing factor to the three most common types of fatal  accidents in aviation: loss of control in - flight (LOC-I), controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), and approach-and-landing accidents.  Thus, pilots need to have:  

1. An accurate mental model of the airplane as an energy system.  2. The competency to effectively coordinate control inputs to achieve and maintain altitude and airspeed targets.  3. The ability to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with mismanagement of energy.  

# Viewing the Airplane as an Energy System  

The total mechanical energy of an airplane in flight is the sum of its potential energy from altitude and kinetic energy from airspeed.  The potential energy is expressed as  $m g h$  , and the kinetic energy as  ½ mV² . Thus, the airplane's total mechanical energy can be stated  as:  

$$
m g h+\%\,m V^{2}
$$  

Where,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{m=m a s s}\\ &{g=g r a\nu i t a t i o n a l\;c o n s t a n t}\\ &{h=h e i g h t\left(a l t i t u d e\right)}\\ &{V=\nu e l o c i t y\left(a i r s p e e d\right)}\end{array}
$$  

A   flying   airplane is   an   “open” energy   system,   which   means   that the airplane can   gain   energy   from   some source   (e.g.,   the fuel tanks)  and lose energy to the environment (e.g., the surrounding air). It also means that energy can be added to or removed from the  airplane’s   total mechanical energy   stored   as altitude and   airspeed.  

# A Frame of Reference for Managing Energy State  

At any given time, the energy state of the airplane is determined by the total amount and distribution of energy stored as altitude and  airspeed.   Note that the pilot’s   frame of   reference   for   managing   the airplane’s   energy   state is   airplane-centric—being a function of  indicated altitude and indicated airspeed, and not height above the ground or groundspeed.  

The indicated altitude displayed in the altimeter and its associated potential energy are based on the height of the airplane above a  fixed reference point (mean sea level or MSL), not on the height above ground level (AGL), which changes with variations in terrain  elevation. Likewise, the indicated airspeed displayed in the airspeed indicator and its associated kinetic energy are based on the speed  of the airplane relative to the air, not on the speed relative to the ground below, which varies with changes in wind speed and  direction.  

Note that changes in indicated altitude and airspeed are attained through forces resulting from the pilot’s direct manipulation of the  controls. These direct control inputs determine the airplane’s ability to climb/descend or accelerate/decelerate. In contrast,  changes in  AGL-altitude and groundspeed are  affected by   “external” factors, such as  varying  terrain elevation and wind, which   the pilot cannot alter. Of course, the pilot should manipulate the airplane’s energy in such way as to minimize any risks  associated with terrain or wind. For example, the pilot may seek to manipulate energy state so as to maximize the airplane’s energy  gains and minimize energy loses when faced with rising terrain. A safer heading may also be an option.  

Once airborne, the airplane gains energy from the force of engine thrust   $(T)$   and it loses energy from aerodynamic drag   $(D)$  . The  difference between energy in and out (  $(T-D)$  ) is the net change, which determines whether total mechanical energy—stored as altitude  and airspeed—increases, decreases, or remains the same.  

When thrust exceeds drag (  $(T-D\,>\,O)$  ), the airplane's total mechanical energy increases. The pilot can store the surplus energy as  increased altitude or airspeed. For example, if the pilot decides to put all the surplus energy into altitude, the airplane can climb at a  constant airspeed.  [Figure   $_{4-I A J}$  If the pilot opts to place all the surplus energy into airspeed, the airplane can accelerate while  maintaining altitude.  [Figure 4-1B]  

When drag exceeds thrust, (  $(T-D<O)$  ), the airplane's total mechanical energy decreases. The pilot has two sources of stored energy to  tap into. For example, the pilot may choose to let the airplane descend at a constant airspeed  [Figure 4-1C)]  or slow down while  maintaining altitude  [Figure  $_{4-I D J}$  as stored energy is withdrawn to deal with the energy deficit. When energy gained equals that lost   $(T-D=O)$  ), all thrust is spent on drag. In this case, the total amount of mechanical energy and its distribution over altitude and  airspeed does not change. Both remain constant as the airplane maintains a constant altitude and airspeed.  [Figure 4-1E]  

Energy can also be exchanged between altitude and airspeed. For example, when a pilot trades airspeed for altitude, as altitude  increases, airspeed decreases. In other words, when energy is exchanged, altitude and airspeed always change in opposite directions  (absent any other energy or control inputs). As one goes up, the other one comes down. Also note that even though the distribution of  energy over altitude and airspeed may change dramatically during energy exchange, the total amount of mechanical energy can  remain the same at the end of the exchange maneuver  [Figure   $_{4-I F J}$  ,  as long as thrust is adjusted to match drag as the latter varies  with changes in airspeed.  

![Figure 4-1 A-F.  Examples of typical energy transactions.  ](images/d2f305c92048b72e944adee8c0336f9d60d2704b25e8cebe9fe5956499d08169.jpg)  

# Managing Energy is a Balancing Act  

Since the airplane gains energy from engine thrust   $(T)$   and loses energy through aerodynamic drag   $(D)$  , energy flows  continuously into and out of the airplane while in flight. Usually measured as  Specific Excess Power   $(P_{S})$  , or rate of energy change,  the net energy flow is a direct function of the difference between thrust and drag.  

$$
P_{S}=(T-D)V/W
$$  

Where,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{T=T h r u s t}\\ &{D=D r a g}\\ &{V=\nu e l o c i t y\left(a i r s p e e d\right)}\\ &{W=a i r c r a f t\;w e i g h t}\end{array}
$$  

More importantly,   there is   a fundamental relationship   between   changes in   the airplane’s   total energy   resulting   from   this   net energy  flow on one hand, and changes in the energy stored as altitude and airspeed on the other. This fundamental relationship can be  summarized   through   the airplane’s   energy   balance   equation.   [Figure 4-2]  

![](images/bfce136d1776fa0b893470a2a9ba2d3c4de70b0faa5005c186f89de8337a0ff3.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.  The energy balance equation.  

The left side of   the energy   balance   equation   represents   the airplane’s   net energy   flow,   while the right side reflects matching changes  to   the   energy   storage.   Thus,   changes   to   the   airplane’s   total   energy   affect   the   left   side   of   the   equation,   while   the   right   side shows  possible changes in energy distribution between altitude and airspeed.  

Note that a change in total energy resulting from the difference between thrust and drag (left side) always matches the change in total  energy redistributed over altitude and airspeed (right side). Although rate of energy change , expressed as specific excess power   $(P_{S})$  ,   varies during flight—becoming positive, negative ,   or zero—both sides of the equation are inexorably balanced regardless of whether  the airplane is accelerating, decelerating, climbing, descending, or maintaining constant altitude and airspeed.  (Note: This  simplified balance equation does not account for long-term changes in total mechanical energy caused by the reduction in  aircraft weight as fuel is gradually burned in flight. Although the effect of weight loss on total energy becomes critical when  solving long-term aircraft performance problems such as range and endurance, it is negligible when considering short-term flight  control problems.)  

Of course, the pilot controls the change in total energy on the left side of the equation, as well as the distribution of any changes in  energy over altitude and airspeed on the right side. How the pilot coordinates the throttle and elevator to achieve and maintain desired  altitude and airspeed targets as well as avoid energy "crises" is at the core of energy management and is elaborated in the rest of the  chapter.  

# Role of the Controls to Manage Energy State  

An energy-centered approach clarifies the roles of the engine and flight controls beyond the simple “pitch for airspeed and power for  altitude” by modeling how throttle and elevator inputs affect the airplane’s total mechanical energy.   From an energy perspective, the  problem of controlling vertical flight path and airspeed becomes one of handling the airplane’s energy state—the total amount  of energy and its distribution over altitude and speed. Thus, rather than asking what controls altitude and what controls airspeed, a  pilot can now ask what controls total energy and what controls its distribution over altitude and airspeed.  

# Primary Energy Role of the Throttle and Elevator  

The throttle, by increasing or decreasing engine thrust against drag, regulates changes in total mechanical energy. As illustrated  above, changing total energy is a function of both thrust and drag (  $(T-D)$  ). However, drag mainly varies long-term due to airspeed  changes, or by using high lift/drag devices which can only increase drag. Therefore, changes in total energy are normally initiated by  changing thrust, not drag. When the throttle setting makes thrust greater than drag, an increase of total mechanical energy is the result.  When the throttle setting makes thrust less than drag, a decrease of total mechanical energy is the result. Once the desired path-speed  profile is established, the throttle sets engine thrust to match the total energy demanded by vertical flight path and airspeed combined.  The throttle then is the  total energy controller .  

On the other hand, the elevator is an energy exchanger and distribution device whose primary job is to allocate changes in total  energy between vertical flight path and airspeed by adjusting pitch attitude. Here, once the chosen path-speed profile is achieved, the  elevator sets the appropriate pitch attitude to maintain the demanded distribution of total energy over vertical flight path and airspeed.  Thus, the elevator is the  energy distribution controller .  

The throttle and elevator then are really energy state controls—neither one controls altitude nor airspeed independently since these  two   variables   are   inherently   coupled   through   the   airplane’s   total   mechanical   energy.   Instead,   to   control   altitude   and   airspeed  effectively, the pilot coordinates the use of both devices to manage the airplane’s energy state.  

The reservoir analogy  [Figure   $_{4-3J}$    illustrates the energy-based role of the throttle and the elevator. In this analogy, the throttle  controls   the “valve”   regulating   the net total energy   flow   while the elevator   controls   the “valve”   regulating   the distribution   of energy  into   and   out   of   the   altitude   and   airspeed   “reservoirs.”   Referring   back   to   the   energy   balance   equation   [ Figure 4-2 ], it becomes clear  then that the throttle controls the left side of the equation (total energy) and the elevator controls the right side (energy distribution).  

As illustrated in  Figure 4-3 , when the throttle increases thrust above drag (  $(T-D\,>\,O)$  ) the airplane gains total energy, and when the  throttle reduces thrust below drag (  $(T-D<O)$  ) the airplane loses total energy. The elevator then distributes this increase or decrease in  total energy between altitude and airspeed. Finally, when the throttle adjusts thrust equal to drag (  $(T-D=O)$  ), there is no change in  total energy, but the energy stored as altitude and airspeed can be exchanged between the two reservoirs using the elevator, while total  energy, at least short-term, remains constant.

Figure 4-3.  The reservoir   analogy illustrating   the primary role of the throttle and   elevator    manage the airplane’s   energy state.  

# Additional Role for the Elevator  

On the front side of the power required curve, where the airplane cruises at high speed (1 in  Figure 4-4 ) and a low angle of attack  (AOA) with little or no excess power or excess thrust (A in  Figure 4-4 ), pulling back on the yoke or stick (elevator up) will result in a  brief energy exchange climb, causing the airplane to slow down from 1 to 2 toward the center of the power curve  [Figure 4-4] . This  decrease in airspeed results in a reduction in total drag; hence available energy in the form of positive excess power (  $(P_{S}>O)$  ) where  thrust exceeds drag (  $(T-D\succ O)$  ). With this excess power (B in  Figure 4-4 ) the airplane can now climb at a constant airspeed or turn in  level flight while maintaining a constant airspeed at an increased load factor.  

On the backside of the power required curve, where the airplane flies at low speed (3 in  Figure 4-4 ) and high AOA with little or no  excess power or excess thrust (C in  Figure 4-4 ), pushing forward on the yoke or stick (elevator down) will result in a brief energy  exchange descent, causing the airplane to accelerate from 3 to 2 toward the center of the power curve  [Figure 4-4] . This increase in  airspeed results in a reduction in total drag; hence available energy in the form of positive excess power   $(P_{S}\!>\!O)$   where thrust exceeds  drag (T –  $(\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{D}>0)$  D > 0). With this excess power (B in  Figure 4-4 ) the airplane can now climb at a constant airspeed or turn in level flight  while maintaining a constant airspeed at an increased load factor. This role of the elevator is critical to prevent unintentional,  excessive deceleration or sink rate as illustrated later in the chapter (refer to  Preventing Irreversible Deceleration and/or Sink Rate  section).  

![](images/b97dd77dfa3bfb968a2a6526186670d31b3aa1d004cc05933a5847825e513f38.jpg)

While the elevator can assist the throttle in changing   $T-D$  D  and   $P_{S}$    through changes in airspeed via energy exchange as described  above,   occasionally   the   elevator   can   directly   increase   the   “D”   in    $T-D$  at any given speed during a level turn, thus helping the  airplane rapidly bleed off total energy.  As the airplane banks, load factor (lift/weight) increases because total lift has to increase to  pull the airplane into the turn while simultaneously balancing its weight. This is accomplished by pulling back on the yoke (or stick)  to increase AOA which results in increased induced drag and power required at any given speed . This action will quickly slow  the airplane  down and   decreas e   total energy more rapidly than by just reducing the throttle setting to idle. This additional role of the  elevator is shown on the power curve.  [Figure 4-5]

Applying the respective role of the controls to manage the airplane’s energy state leads to a set of simple “rules” for proper throttle- elevator coordination to effectively control vertical flight path and airspeed. What are these basic rules of energy control?  

# Rules of Energy Control  

The central principle encapsulating the role of the throttle and elevator for managing the airplane’s energy can be summed up   as follows: coordinated throttle and elevator inputs control the airplane’s energy state.   Modifying a popular adage, the principle can  be restated as “pitch plus power controls energy state.”   This central principle serves to guide a set of general energy control rules to  achieve and maintain any desired vertical flight path and airspeed targets within the airplane’s energy envelope.  

# Visualizing the Airplane’s Ability to “Move” Between Energy States  

To   better   understand   the   basic   rules   of   energy   control,   a pilot   needs   to   visualize   an   airplane’s   energy   state   and   its   ability   to switch  from one energy state to another. In other words, how does an airplane “move” from an initial altitude and airspeed to any other target  altitude and airspeed within its flight envelope, and how does the pilot control the process? A map  should   help , and in this case, it  charts the status of the aircraft in terms of energy .  

In a navigation map, such as an aeronautical sectional chart, the geographic position of an airplane is determined by two variables—   latitude and longitude. Likewise, in an “altitude-airspeed” or “energy” map the energy position of an airplane, its energy state,  is defined by two variables—altitude and airspeed.  [Figure 4-6]  

![](images/ab144288bf26492c8cbe73beaa038b92279ca9968aadefe16fe19a23d288e229.jpg)  
Figure 4-6.  The altitude-speed “map” showing lines of constant energy height.  

The position of an airplane in the altitude-airspeed map represents its total specific energy or   $E_{S}$    (which is simply the sum of its  potential and kinetic energies divided by aircraft weight) as determined by its current altitude and airspeed.  

$$
E_{S}=h+\frac{V^{2}}{2g}
$$  

Where,  

$g=$   gravitational constant   $h=$   height (altitude)   $V=$   velocity (airspeed)  

Since the total specific energy,  $E_{S}$  , has the units of height (e.g. ,   feet), it is usually called energy height. It also gets this name from the  fact that energy height is the  maximum  height that an airplane would reach from its current altitude, if it were to trade all its speed for  altitude.  Figure 4-6  shows lines of constant total specific energy or energy height. Different positions of an airplane along a given  energy height line have the same total energy regardless of their location on the line (e.g., A and B).  

Thus, even though the airplane in point A is cruising at 100 knots and 6,000 feet, it has the same total specific energy expressed in  height (6,500 feet) when cruising at 240 knots and 4,000 feet (B). This also means that the airplane in either position, A or B, would  be able to   “zoom” to   the same maximum   altitude of   6,500   feet by   trading   all its   speed   for   altitude.   The lines of   constant energy height  can be used as idealized trajectories to depict an airplane moving from one energy state to another solely through energy  exchange (e.g. ,   A to B). If the airplane rapidly exchanges altitude and airspeed, it would follow along the energy height line while, in  the short term, maintaining constant total energy.  

In addition to showing energy height lines, the energy map can also depict available specific excess power   $(P_{S})$   contours, as well as  energy trajectories of an airplane moving from one energy state to another.  [Figure 4-7]  The airplane can move along energy height  lines by simply exchanging energy (e.g., A to B). However, to move across energy height lines, the airplane needs to increase or  decrease total energy while distributing the energy change between altitude and airspeed. Thus, the ability of an airplane to go from  one energy height to another (e.g. ,   from A to positions C, D, or E) is a function of specific excess power   $(P_{S})$  , measured in rate  of change in distance or height (e.g. ,  feet per minute).  

Examine the energy positions depicted in  Figure 4-7 . The airplane in position A is flying at 4,000 feet and 150 knots with a total  energy equivalent to 5,000 feet. Since positions C, D and E are located at higher energy heights (11,000, 9,500, and 6,500 feet  respectively), the only way for the airplane to reach them from position A is by increasing its total energy (i.e., increasing  thrust above drag, or   $P_{S}\,>\,O_{c}$  ). The reverse is also true. If the airplane is in position C, D or E, the only way for it to get back to  position A is by decreasing its total energy (i.e., decreasing thrust below drag, or   $P_{S}\,<\,O_{I}$  ). In other words, the rate at which the  airplane can move from one energy height to another—e.g., how swiftly it can climb/descend at a steady speed, or accelerate/  decelerate in level flight—is a function of specific excess power, which can be positive   $(P_{S}>0)$   or negative   $(P_{S}<0)$   depending on  whether the airplane needs to move to an energy height that demands more or less total energy.  

At the edge of the energy envelope, where available   $P_{S}\,=\,0$  = 0 at full throttle, the airplane can no longer climb while maintaining  airspeed or accelerate without descending. Inside this envelope, inner contours increase in value, reaching a “peak” where available   $P_{S}$    is maximized. Notice that   $P_{S}$    at full throttle is maximized at a specific airspeed   $(V_{Y})$   decreasing in value at slower or faster  airspeeds. At   $V_{Y}$    then, the airplane can attain the maximum rate of climb while maintaining airspeed or the maximum acceleration  without descending  [Figure 4-7] .

# Three Basic Rules of Energy Control  

An   “energy-control” map   can   help   visualize   the basic energy   control rules.  [Figure 4-8]  The energy-control map depicts not only the  trajectories of an airplane transitioning from an arbitrary initial energy state (1) to other target states (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), but also the  changes in energy caused by the throttle (blue/red arrows) and the elevator (green arrows). In other words, it allows pilots to visualize  the basic control rules for moving an airplane from any state to another. The edge of the sustainable energy state envelope (where   $P_{S}$   $=O$    at full throttle) is also illustrated.  

Note that the line of constant total energy (dashed line) that divides the area in the map requiring more total energy (blue area) from  that which requires less energy (red area) is depicted relative to the arbitrary initial energy state (1). The throttle adds (blue arrow) or  subtracts (red arrow) the amount of total energy demanded by the new target energy state, while the elevator (green arrows)  distributes the correct amount of total energy between potential and kinetic energies. By balancing the simultaneous actions of the  controls, the airplane can follow the desired energy trajectory.  

As illustrated in  Figure 4-8 , moving the airplane from position 1 to the energy states in 2 and 3 calls for a higher throttle setting to  increase total energy by the same amount (in this example, positions 2 and 3 are located at the same higher - energy height).  The difference between these two energy trajectories (1-to-2 and 1-to-3) lies in the way the total energy change is distributed  by the elevator through changes in pitch attitude. As can be seen in  Figure 4-8 , changes in total energy by adjusting throttle setting  (blue/red arrows) extend across lines of constant total energy (dashed line), while changes in energy distribution by adjusting  the elevator deflection (green arrows) extend along the lines of constant total energy (equal energy height). Appropriate changes in  total energy via the throttle and/or changes in energy distribution via the elevator, depicted by their  respective   energy “arrows,” determine the direction of a given energy trajectory between two energy states. To visualize this effect, compare  the trajector y   from 1-to-2  with that   from 1-to-3 and  notice  the way the corresponding elevator energy arrows (left green arrow   $=$  up-elevator; right green arrow   $=$  down-elevator) are positioned in relation to the throttle energy arrow (blue arrow   $=$  increased  throttle).

Figure 4-8.  The energy-control map helping to visualize the basic energy control rules.  

Thus, transitioning to a higher altitude at a constant speed (1-to-2) requires increased throttle and up - elevator to stay on speed, while  transitioning to a faster airspeed at a constant altitude (1-to-3) demands increased throttle and (gradual) down - elevator to stay on path,  re-trimming as needed to relieve elevator control pressures.  

Transitioning to a lower altitude at a constant speed (1-to-4) requires decreased throttle and down - elevator to stay on speed, while  transitioning to a slower airspeed at a constant altitude (1-to-5) demands decreased throttle and (gradual) up - elevator to stay on path,  re-trimming as needed to relieve elevator control pressures.  

Finally, transitioning to a higher altitude by trading speed for altitude (1-to-6) requires up - elevator without initially changing throttle  setting, while transitioning to a faster airspeed by trading altitude for speed (1-to-7) requires down - elevator without initially changing  throttle setting. In both cases, at the end of the energy exchange maneuver,  the  elevator will need to be re-trimmed and throttle  setting adjusted to match drag at the new speed in order to maintain total energy constant while remaining at the new altitude-airspeed  target.  

As can be visualized in  Figure 4-8 , there are three general energy control rules for coordinating the throttle and elevator to move the  airplane from  one   energy state to another:  

R ule   #1:  If  you want to move to a new energy state that demands more total energy,  then :  Throttle:  increase throttle setting so that thrust is greater than drag, thus increasing total energy;  

Elevator:  adjust pitch attitude as appropriate to distribute the total energy being gained over altitude and airspeed:  

a. To climb at constant speed, pitch up just enough to maintain the desired speed;  b. To accelerate at constant altitude, gradually pitch down just enough to maintain path.  

Upon reaching new desired energy state, adjust pitch attitude and throttle setting as needed to maintain the new path-speed  profile.  

R ule   #2:  If  you want to move to a new energy state that demands less total energy,  then :  Throttle:  reduce throttle setting so that thrust is less than drag, thus decreasing total energy;  Elevator:  adjust pitch attitude as appropriate to distribute the total energy being lost over altitude and airspeed:  

a. To descend at constant speed, pitch down just enough to maintain the desired speed;  b. To slow down at constant altitude, gradually pitch up just enough to maintain path.  

Upon reaching new desired energy state, adjust pitch attitude and throttle setting as needed to maintain the new path-speed  profile.  

R ule   #3:  If  you want to move to a new energy state that demands no change in total energy,  then :  Throttle:  do not change initially, but adjust to match drag at the end of maneuver as needed to maintain total energy constant;  Elevator:  adjust pitch attitude to exchange energy between altitude and airspeed:  

Upon reaching new desired energy state, adjust pitch attitude and throttle setting as needed to maintain the new path-speed  profile.  

Note that control rules 1 and 2 allow the elevator to distribute the change in total energy in different ways. For example, using rule  1.a the pilot may choose to adjust the pitch-up attitude to climb at a slower (or faster) airspeed. Other situations may require  combining two control rules. One example is when, at maximum cruise airspeed in level flight, thrust has reached its maximum limit  (i.e. ,    $P_{S}\,=\,0$  = 0) but the target energy state is at a higher altitude and total energy within the airplane’s envelope. At maximum  level airspeed, there is no excess thrust available to increase the airplane’s total energy needed to climb. One solution is to initially  trade kinetic for potential energy (rule 3.a), slowing down to an airspeed where drag is reduced below thrust, thus allowing the  airplane to increase its total energy and climb at that slower airspeed (rule 1.a).  

# Mitigating Risks from Mismanagement of Energy  

Besides learning the proper use of the controls for normal energy management tasks, pilots should be equipped with the ability to  identify, assess, and mitigate two major risks associated with mismanagement of energy: 1)    unwanted deviations from the  desired energy state; and 2) unintentional, irreversible deceleration and/or sink rate  causing depletion of mechanical energy . The  first risk involves unintended altitude-airspeed deviations (refer to  Managing Energy Errors  section). The second risk entails  unforeseen, continuous airspeed and/or altitude loss coupled with little or no available excess power in a given flight condition (refer  to  Preventing Irreversible Deceleration and/or Sink Rate  section).  

# Two Energy Management Scenarios  

Two flight scenarios illustrate the two major risks associated with failure to manage the airplane's energy state and how a pilot can  identify, assess, and mitigate those risks.  

# Scenario 1  

Unintentionally descending below the desired glideslope on final approach to landing and failing to make the proper correction.  [Figure 4-9]  To bring the airplane back to the desired glideslope, should the pilot pitch up, throttle up, or both?

# Scenario 2  

Flying toward rising terrain and not being able to fly up and over it before impacting terrain.  [Figure 4-10]  Note the rising terrain all  along the departure corridor. What can the pilot do to prevent an impending crash?

Figure 4-10.  Departing from Runway 33, Aspen/Pitkin County Airport (KASE), elevation 7,820 feet.  

For both scenarios, this section will demonstrate how proper energy management can provide the pilot with the skill to manage the  associated risks and avoid tragic results.  

# Managing Energy Errors  

In addition to learning effective techniques for maintaining stabilized path-speed profiles ( e.g.,   tracking the glideslope)  and transitioning from one profile to another during flight ( e.g.,   leveling off from a descent), pilots should develop skills for  managing unwanted deviations in vertical flight path and airspeed—returning the airplane to its target energy state. Since many  inflight “energy crises” start as undetected, ignored or poorly managed path-speed deviations, pilots need the skills to recognize,  correct and prevent these deviations.  

Although   the intention    to   correct altitude and   airspeed   deviations,   the pilot is   always   acting   on   the airplane’s   energy   state. Thus, it  is important to translate altitude-speed deviations into energy errors.  [Figure 4-11]  Because the airplane’s   total energy    distributed   over altitude and airspeed, there are two types of energy errors: 1) total energy errors and 2) energy distribution errors.  

![](images/64283dd050d644e0f6e75f2f8d958db3002cf00db8d4cdff642eb1ca95f050c6.jpg)  
Figure 4-11 . An energy state matrix that translates the main altitude-speed deviations into energy errors relative to the desired energy  state (5).  

Monitoring the altimeter (or other flight path reference) and airspeed indicator allows the pilot to distinguish these two types of  energy errors. In total energy errors, the airplane has too much energy (blue boxes) or too little energy (red boxes). The pilot will  notice that altitude and   speed   deviate in   the same direction   (“lower-and-slower” or   “higher-and-faster”).   On   the other   hand,    energy   distribution errors the airplane may have the correct amount of total energy (green boxes) but its distribution over altitude and speed is  incorrect. Here, altitude and speed deviate in opposite directions (“higher-and-slower” or “lower-and-faster”). I n this case, the pilot deals  with relative deviations—not absolute altitude and speed.  

Following energy management principles, total energy errors are corrected by increasing or decreasing energy using the throttle,  while energy distribution errors are corrected by exchanging energy between altitude and speed using the elevator. To correct a  combination of total energy and distribution errors, both controls need to be used simultaneously.  Figure 4-12  summarizes the control  skills needed to correct total energy and energy distribution errors.  

Scenario 1  [Figure 4-9]  is a good example to illustrate energy errors and the skills needed to correct and avoid them.  Figure 4-13  actually depicts three possible scenarios (B, C, and D) where an airplane on final approach to land has descended below its intended  flight path. Should the pilot pitch up, throttle up, or both? It depends. The airplane is lower than desired, but the pilot should check  the airspeed as well. Relative to the target airspeed, the actual speed may be slower (B), faster (D), or on target (C). In all three cases,  the goal is to return the airplane to its correct energy state (A), following a deviation in altitude and/or airspeed.  

Lower-and-slower (B) is fundamentally different from lower-and-faster (D). The former requires advancing the throttle forward to  regain total energy (3 in  Figure 4-12 ), while the latter requires pulling back on the yoke/stick to null the energy distribution error (9  in  Figure 4-12 ).  

![](images/53427460f30269410c0489256013141f4bd58b9c7a6ec99d1c69a5fa505c570b.jpg)  

Note that in the scenario depicted in B in  Figure 4-13 , ad vancing the throttle forward   to increase energy would only succeed if  excess thrust is available (  $(P_{S}\,>\,O)$  ). This may not be the case if the pilot has badly mismanaged energy and slowed down to a  speed where induced drag is so high that even applying full throttle would result in no surplus energy (see column "Cautions When  Very Slow" in  Figure 4-12 ). Depending on the flight condition, available excess power at full throttle may be negative (  $(P_{S}\,<\,O)$  ).  In this case, the only recourse is to first trade altitude for speed by pushing forward on the yoke/stick, reducing AOA and  induced drag, and only then advancing the throttle forward to regain total energy. But if the airplane is too close to the ground, there  may not be enough room to reverse the negative energy rate and prevent the airplane from striking the ground.  

Now consider the scenario depicted in C in  Figure 4-13 , where the airplane has descended below the desired flight path but is flying  at the correct speed. Here, even though there is no speed deviation, the pilot is faced with a combination of total energy and  distribution errors. Regaining altitude without changing speed requires ad vancing the throttle forward   while easing aft on the yoke /   stick   (6 in  Figure 4-12 ). In other words, decoupling altitude and airspeed (i.e. changing one without changing the other) demands  the use of both controls simultaneously.  

In all cases, path and speed should be monitored carefully as they are corrected, adjusting pitch attitude and throttle setting as  appropriate. Once short-term deviations are corrected, the airplane will need to be trimmed for long-term control to maintain the  desired path-speed profile (5 in  Figure 4-12 ).  

![](images/c0435144e19602470cf9e150f332ea34f27f9d6003955e9b99bd521a0a04757d.jpg)  
Figure 4-13.  Energy error management.  

The above approach-to-landing scenario is just one example illustrating the risk of mismanaging altitude-speed deviations.  Pilots need to be able to identify, assess ,   and mitigate altitude and/or airspeed deviations during any phase of flight, including traffic  pattern operations, take-offs and climbs, cruise flight, descending flight, and any procedure or maneuver involving turns.  

Clearly, skills for promptly correcting path-speed deviations can enhance flight safety but the pilot should also be aware of the risk of  unrecoverable   depletion   of   the   airplane’s   mechanical   energy,   especially   as the   airplane   approaches   the   edges   of   its   flight   envelope  where available excess power is zero.  

# Preventing Irreversible Deceleration and/or Sink Rate  

During normal flight, the airplane experiences many instances of negative energy rates (negative specific excess power or   $P_{S}<O_{I}$  )  while decelerating at a constant altitude or descending at a constant airspeed; these are intended energy bleed rates. However, one of  the greatest   dangers   from   mismanaging   the airplane’s   energy   state is   encountering   unintended,   excessive deceleration   and/or   sink rate  coupled with little or no positive excess power available under a given flight condition. Failure to recover above a certain critical  altitude results in depletion of mechanical energy. Regardless of what the pilot does past that point, the airplane will hit the ground.  

To   help   pilots   understand   the   risk   of   unintended   energy   depletion,   let’s   take   a closer   look   at Scenario    [Figure 4-10] . This flight  scenario illustrates a situation that is all too common in general aviation: flying toward rising terrain and not being able to fly up and  over it before impacting terrain.  

As  shown in   Figure 4-10 , there is rising terrain all along the departure corridor. The scenario is as follows:  

1.   A pilot of a normally - aspirated, twin-engine airplane departs out of Rocky Mountain Metropolitan airport  (KBJC) in the morning on a nice summer day and flies into Aspen/Pitkin County airport (KASE).  

2.   The pilot enjoys the scenery around Aspen, eats lunch, and decides to return home in the early hot  afternoon.  

3.   The pilot departs KASE off of runway 33. At full throttle/power the airplane takes longer to accelerate but  rotates at the normal speed.  4.   The pilot pitches to the normal pitch target, retracts the gear, and initiates a climb.  5.   The pilot notices the airplane isn’t performing as desired. The pilot checks to see if the gear is up and   adjusts the mixtures to try and get a little more power.  6.   The terrain is rising, the pilot gradually pitches up, and the airplane starts losing airspeed.  7.   The airplane quits climbing.  8.   The stall horn begins to sound.  

The above scenario is hypothetical, but there have been very similar situations that have ended tragically.  

The airplane in the above scenario has encountered an unintended deceleration and impending sink rate that could rapidly become  irreversible. This can be shown in two ways, using the traditional power curve  [Figure 4-14]  and the energy map  [Figure 4-15] :  

![](images/a5af3e2972331925d1c37ded01c80a086f42cc781b5457aa7c0b59c3503d19ac.jpg)  
Figure 4-14.  The energy depletion scenario viewed in the power required and available curve. Compared with the power available  curve depicted in Figure 4-4, note the lower power available curve at this high elevation (7,820 feet at the departure airport) and  higher density altitude than standard during a hot afternoon.  

As illustrated in the airplane's power required and available curves  [Figure 4-14] , the airplane slows down, going from speed 1 where  it is climbing (A: power available greater than power required), to speed 2, where it stops climbing (B: power available equal to  power required), and continuing to speed 3 where the stall horn sounds (C: power available less than power required). The  energy map  [Figure 4-15]  tells the same story from a total mechanical energy standpoint: the airplane has positive   $P_{S}$    at point 1 and  climbs to point 2 where it stops climbing since   $P_{S}=O$  , then continues to point 3, where the  $P_{S}<O$    and the stall horn sounds.  

![](images/13f701f219acd4196e34e671c55c6908128e0172bc069732ca99abcc6f36d260.jpg)  
Figure 4-15.  The energy depletion scenario viewed in the energy map. Specific excess power   $(P_{S})$   contours are labeled in units of feet  per minute.  

The question then is: what does the pilot do to recover from this predicament? The answer is proper energy management. The  airplane needs to move to a different place on the energy map that will allow the airplane to begin climbing. So, what does that mean?  

⦁  As can be seen in  Figure 4-12 , the pilot is in a scenario akin to that at the desired altitude, but with      cautions when very slow.  ⦁  The pilot then has to do something that is not intuitive; consider gaining speed at the expense of some  altitude initially to improve climbing performance with full  throttle .  ⦁  Once the airplane accelerates to an airspeed in which the  $P_{S}>O$  , it can begin to climb again.  

The above recovery scenario is shown in the energy map  Figure 4-16,  which illustrates the important role of the elevator in  assisting the pilot to recover from unintentional and dangerous decelerati o n and/or sink rate (refer to  Additional Role for the Elevator  section).  

T he airplane needs to gain speed at the expense of some altitude, moving from point 3 where the   $P_{S}<O$  to point 4 where the   $P_{S}>O$  .  The airplane can then initiate a constant airspeed climb to point 5, at the desired target altitude and airspeed  [Figure 4-16] . Note that  the desired target climb airspeed in the presence of rising terrain may be   $V_{X},$   the speed for best angle of climb.   $V_{X}$    is slightly slower  than   $V_{Y:}$  , the speed for best rate of climb, and will result in a lower climb rate but steepest climb angle. Once the airplane has  recovered from the unintentional airspeed loss and begins climbing at  $V_{X}$  , the pilot should assess the situation and make an important  decision to mitigate further risk—either continue climbing or do something else. Should the airplane not have the needed  performance to safely clear the rising terrain on its intended course, the pilot has at least another available option: make a 180  degree turn and return to land at the departure airport until temperature and density altitude conditions improve.  

![](images/2110d260f1bcb1412a953c3740bf5a8675148a040b4ccbe9c177e849a57736ee.jpg)  
Figure 4-16.  The energy loss scenario recovery viewed in the energy map. Specific excess power   $(P_{S})$   contours are labeled in units of  feet per minute.  

The above rising terrain scenario is just one example illustrating the risk of irreversible deceleration and/or sink rate. Pilots need to be  aware that unintentional depletion of mechanical energy can happen in various instances, especially as the airplane approaches  the slow edge of its energy envelope at low altitude, where available specific excess power   $(P_{S})$   is zero. Examples include unstable/  slow approaches to landing; high-drag go-arounds where the pilot neglects to raise the gear and/or flaps; and steeper-than-normal  turns in the traffic pattern. Note that irreversible sink rates do not necessarily involve exceeding the critical AOA resulting in a stall  and spin. The airplane can be unstalled and still experience unrecoverable sink rates near the high - speed edge of its energy  envelope, where available specific excess power   $(P_{S})$   is also zero. Two examples are high - speed steep spirals following botched steep  level turns, and high - speed dives too close to the ground.  

The bottom line? Should the airplane ever experience unintended excessive negative energy rates with little or no excess power  available under a given flight condition, the pilot needs to use proper energy management allowing a prompt recovery and a suitable  follow-up action.  

# Review of Terms and Definitions  

The terms and definitions specific to this chapter appear below.  

# Aircraft Energy Management  

The process   of   planning,   monitoring   and   controlling   altitude and   airspeed   targets in   relation   to   the airplane’s   energy   state.   Note that  this definition is concerned with managing mechanical energy (altitude and airspeed) and addresses the safety (flight control) side of  energy management. It does not address the efficiency (aircraft performance) side of energy management, which is concerned with  how efficiently the engine generates mechanical energy from fuel and how efficiently the airframe spends that energy in flight.  

# Energy System  

A flying airplane is an  open  energy system. That means that the airplane can gain energy from some source (e.g. ,   fuel) and lose  energy to the environment (e.g. ,   surrounding air). In addition, energy can be added to or removed from the airplane’s total mechanical  energy stored as altitude and airspeed.  

# Total Mechanical Energy  

Sum of the energy in altitude (potential energy) and the energy in airspeed (kinetic energy).  

# Kinetic Energy  

Amount of energy due to the airspeed, expressed as  $\mathit{\Pi}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{\Pi}}_{\mathit{$  , where   $m=$  airplane’s mass, and   $V\!=$   airspeed.  

# Potential Energy  

Amount of energy due to the altitude, expressed as  $m g h$  , where   $m=$  airplane’s mass,   $g=$  = gravitational constant, and   $h=$  altitude.  

# Energy State  

The airplane’s total mechanical energy and its distribution between altitude and airspeed.  

# Energy Exchange  

Trading one form of energy (e.g. ,   altitude) for another form (e.g. ,   airspeed).  

# Energy Balance Equation  

According to this equation, the net transfer of mechanical energy into and out of the airplane (a function of thrust minus drag) is  always equal to the change in its total mechanical energy (a function of altitude and airspeed). Note that this simplified definition does  not account for long-term changes in total mechanical energy caused by the reduction in aircraft weight as fuel is gradually burned in  flight.  

# Power Available  

The airplane’s rate of energy gain due to maximum available engine thrust at a given airspeed. Expressed as   $T V,$  , where   $T\!=$  engine thrust and   $V\!=$   airspeed. Usually measured in horsepower, foot-pound per minute, or foot-pound per second.  

# Power Required  

The airplane’s rate of energy loss due to total drag at a given airspeed. Expressed as   $D V$  , where   $D=$  total drag and   $V=$  airspeed.  Usually measured in horsepower, foot-pound per minute, or foot-pound per second.  

# Specific Excess Power   $(P_{s})$  

Measured in feet per minute or feet per second, it represents rate of energy change—the ability of an airplane to climb or accelerate  from a given flight condition. Available specific excess power is found by dividing the difference between power available and power  required   by   the airplane’s   weight.  

# Energy Height or Total Specific Energy  $(E_{s})$  

Measured in units of height (e.g. ,   feet), it represents the airplane’s total energy per unit weight. It is found by dividing the sum  of potential energy and kinetic energy by the airplane’s weight. It also represents the maximum height that an airplane would reach  from its current altitude, if it were to trade all its speed for altitude.  

# Energy Erro r  

An   altitude and/or   airspeed   deviation   from   an   intended   target expressed    terms   of   energy.   Depending   on   the airplane’s   total   amount  of energy and its distribution between altitude and airspeed, energy errors are classified as total energy errors, energy distribution  errors, or a combination of both errors.  

# Total Energy Error  

An energy error where the total amount of mechanical energy is not correct. The airplane has too much or too little total energy  relative to the intended altitude-speed profile. When this error occurs, the pilot will observe that altitude and airspeed deviate in the  same  direction (e.g. ,   higher and faster than desired; or lower and slower than desired). An example would be an airplane on  final approach that is above the desired glide slope and at a faster airspeed than desired.  

# Energy Distribution Error  

An energy error where the total mechanical energy is correct, but the distribution between potential (altitude) and kinetic energy  (airspeed) is not correct relative to the intended altitude-speed profile. When this error occurs, the pilot will observe that altitude and  airspeed deviate in  opposite  directions (e.g. ,   higher and slower than desired; or lower and faster than desired). An example would be  an airplane on final approach that is above the desired glide slope and at a slower airspeed than desired.  

# Irreversible Deceleration and/or Sink Rate  

Unrecoverable depletion of mechanical energy as a result of continuous loss of airspeed and/or altitude coupled with insufficient  excess power available under a given flight condition. Failure to recover above a certain critical AGL altitude results in the airplane  hitting the ground regardless of what the pilot does.  

# Chapter Summary  

Every pilot is an energy manager—managing energy in the form of altitude and airspeed from takeoff to landing. Proper energy  management is essential for performing any maneuver as well as for attaining and maintaining desired vertical flightpath and airspeed  profiles in everyday flying. It is also critical to flight safety since mistakes in managing energy state can contribute to loss of control  inflight (LOC-I), controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) ,   and approach and landing accidents. The objectives of this chapter are for pilots  to: 1) gain an understanding of basic energy management concepts; 2) learn the energy role of the controls for managing the  airplane’s energy state; and 3) develop the ability to identify, assess ,  and mitigate risks associated with failure to manage the airplane’s energy state.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  

# Chapter 5: Maintaining Aircraft Control: Upset Prevention and Recovery  Training  

# Introduction  

Safe pilots prevent loss of control in flight (LOC-I), which is the leading cause of fatal general aviation accidents in the U.S. and  commercial aviation worldwide. LOC-I includes any significant deviation of an aircraft from the intended flightpath and it often  results from an airplane upset. Maneuvering represents the most common phase of flight for general aviation LOC-I accidents;  however, LOC-I accidents occur in all phases of flight.  

To prevent LOC-I accidents, it is important for pilots to recognize and maintain a heightened awareness of situations that increase the  risk of loss of control. Those situations include: uncoordinated flight, equipment malfunctions, pilot complacency,  distraction, turbulence, and poor risk management. Attempting to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) when the  pilot is not qualified or proficient is a common example of poor risk management. The  Emergency Procedures  chapter of this  handbook contains specific information regarding unintended flight into IMC. Sadly, there are also LOC-I accidents resulting from  intentional disregard for safety.  

To maintain aircraft control when faced with these or other contributing factors, the pilot needs to be aware of situations where LOC-I  can occur; recognize when an airplane is approaching a stall, has stalled, or is in an upset condition; and understand and execute the  correct procedures to recover the aircraft.  

# Defining an Airplane Upset  

The term “upset” was formally introduced by an industry work group in 2004 in the “Pilot Guide to Airplane Upset Recovery,” which  is a part of the “Airplane Upset Recovery Training Aid.” The work group was primarily focused on large transport airplanes and  sought to come up with one term to describe an “unusual attitude” or “loss of control,” for example, and to generally describe specific  parameters as part of its definition. Consistent with the Guide, the FAA considers an upset to be  an  event that unintentionally  exceeds the parameters normally experienced in flight or training. These parameters are:  

1.   Pitch attitude greater than   $25^{\circ}$  , nose up  2.   Pitch attitude greater than   $10^{\circ}$  , nose down  3.   Bank angle greater than  $45^{\circ}$    4.   Within the above parameters, but flying at airspeeds inappropriate for the conditions  

The reference to inappropriate airspeeds describes a number of undesired aircraft states, including stalls. However, stalls are directly  related to angle of attack (AOA), not airspeed.  

To develop the crucial skills to prevent LOC-I, a pilot may receive academic or on-aircraft upset prevention and recovery training  (UPRT), which should include: slow flight, stalls, spins, and unusual attitudes.  

Upset training places considerable emphasis on understanding and preventing an upset, so a pilot avoids such a situation. If an upset  does occur, upset training also reinforces proper recovery techniques. A detailed discussion of UPRT follows, including core  concepts, what the training should include, and what airplanes or kinds of simulation can be used for the training. A discussion  of various maneuvers and how to execute them follows later in this chapter.  

# Upset Prevention and Recovery  

An unusual attitude is commonly referenced as an unintended or unexpected attitude in instrument flight. These unusual attitudes are  introduced to a pilot during student pilot training as part of basic attitude instrument flying and continue to be trained and tested as  part of certification for an instrument rating, aircraft type rating, and an airline transport pilot certificate. A pilot is taught the  conditions or situations that could cause an unusual attitude, with focus on how to recognize one, and how to recover from one.  

# Unusual Attitudes Versus Upsets  

Given the upset definition, there are a few key distinctions between an unusual attitude and an upset. An upset:  

⦁  Includes stall events.  

⦁  Includes overspeeds or other inappropriate speeds for a given flight condition.  ⦁  Has defined parameters. For example, for training purposes an instructor could place the aircraft in a  $30^{\circ}$        bank with a nose-up pitch attitude of   $15^{\circ}$   and ask the student to recover and that would be considered an      unusual attitude, but would not meet the upset parameters.  ⦁  Centers on unintentional situations that may lead to a startle effect. For example, during unusual attitude      training, the pilot is often directed to close their eyes, and any element of surprise disappears.  

The top four causal and contributing factors that have led to an upset and resulted in LOC-I accidents are:  

1. Environmental factors  2. Mechanical factors  3. Human factors  4. Stall-related factors  

# Environmental Factors  

Turbulence, or a large variation in wind velocity over a short distance, can cause upset and LOC-I. Maintain awareness of conditions  that can lead to various types of turbulence, such as clear air turbulence, mountain waves, wind shear, and thunderstorms or  microbursts. In addition to environmentally-induced turbulence, wake turbulence from other aircraft can lead to upset and LOC-I.  

Icing can destroy the smooth flow of air over the airfoil and increase drag while decreasing the ability of the airfoil to create lift.  Therefore, it can significantly degrade airplane performance, resulting in a stall if not handled correctly.  

# Mechanical Factors  

Modern airplanes and equipment are very reliable, but anomalies do occur. Some of these mechanical failures can directly cause a  departure from normal flight, such as asymmetrical flaps, malfunctioning or binding flight controls, and runaway trim.  

Upsets can also occur if there is a malfunction or misuse of the autoflight system. Advanced automation may tend to mask the cause  of the anomaly. Disengaging the autopilot and the autothrottles allows the pilot to directly control the airplane and possibly eliminate  the cause of the problem. For these reasons the pilot should maintain proficiency to manually fly the airplane in all flight conditions  without the use of the autopilot/autothrottles.  

Although these and other in-flight anomalies may not be preventable, knowledge of systems and AFM/POH recommended  procedures helps the pilot minimize their impact and prevent an upset. In the case of instrument failures, avoiding an upset and  subsequent LOC-I   may   depend   on   the pilot’s   proficiency    the use of   secondary   instrumentation   and   partial panel operations.  

# Human Factors  

# VMC to IMC  

Unfortunately, accident reports indicate that continued VFR flight from visual meteorological conditions (VMC) into marginal VMC  and IMC is a factor contributing to LOC-I. A loss of the natural horizon substantially increases the chances of encountering vertigo or  spatial disorientation, which can lead to upset.  

# IMC  

When operating in IMC, maintain awareness of conditions.  

# Diversion of Attention  

In addition to its direct impact, an in-flight anomaly   or   malfunction   can   also   lead   to   an   upset if   it diverts   the pilot’s   attention   from   basic airplane control responsibilities. Failing to monitor the automated systems, over-reliance on those systems, or incomplete  knowledge and experience with those systems can lead to an upset. Diversion of attention can also occur simply from the pilot’s   efforts to set avionics or navigation equipment while flying the airplane.  

# Task Saturation  

The margin of safety is the difference between task requirements and pilot capabilities. An upset and eventual LOC-I can occur  whenever requirements exceed capabilities. For example, an airplane upset event that requires rolling an airplane from a near-inverted  to an upright orientation may demand piloting skills beyond those learned during primary training. In another example, a fatigued  pilot who inadvertently encounters IMC at night coupled with a vacuum pump failure, or a pilot fails to engage pitot heat while flying  in IMC, could become disoriented and lose control of the airplane due to the demands of extended—and unpracticed—partial panel  flight. Additionally, unnecessary low-altitude flying and impromptu demonstrations for friends or others on the ground could lead  pilots to exceed their capabilities, with fatal results.  

# Sensory Overload/Deprivation  

A   pilot’s   ability   to   adequately   correlate   warnings,   annunciations,   instrument indications,   and   other   cues from   the airplane during an  upset can be limited. Pilots faced with upset situations can be rapidly confronted with multiple or simultaneous visual, auditory, and  tactile warnings. Conversely, sometimes expected warnings are not provided when they should be; this situation can distract a pilot as  much as multiple warnings can.  

The ability to separate time-critical information from distractions takes practice, experience, and knowledge of the airplane and its  systems. Cross-checks are necessary not only to corroborate other information that has been presented, but also to determine if  information might be missing or invalid. For example, a stall warning system may fail and therefore not warn a pilot of close  proximity to a stall, so other cues need to be used to avert a stall and possible LOC-I. These cues include aerodynamic buffet, loss of  roll authority, or inability to arrest a descent.  

# Spatial Disorientation  

Spatial disorientation has been a significant factor in many airplane upset accidents. Accident data from 2008 to 2013 shows nearly  200 accidents associated with spatial disorientation with more than   $70\%$   of those being fatal. All pilots are susceptible to false sensory  illusions while flying at night or in certain weather conditions. These illusions can lead to a conflict between actual attitude  indications and what the pilot senses is the correct attitude. Disoriented pilots may not always be aware of their orientation error.  Many airplane upsets occur while the pilot is engaged in some task that takes attention away from the flight instruments or outside  references. Others perceive a conflict between bodily senses and the flight instruments, and allow the airplane to divert from the  desired flightpath because they cannot resolve the conflict.  

A pilot may experience spatial disorientation or perceive the situation in one of three ways:  

1. Recognized spatial disorientation: the pilot recognizes the developing upset or the upset condition and is  able to safely correct the situation.  2. Unrecognized spatial disorientation: the pilot is unaware that an upset event is developing, or has occurred,  and fails to make essential decisions or take any corrective action to prevent LOC-I.  3. Incapacitating spatial disorientation: the pilot is unable to affect a recovery due to some combination of:  

(a) not understanding the events as they are unfolding, (b) lacking the skills required to alleviate or correct  the situation, or (c) exceeding psychological or physiological ability to cope with what is happening.  

For detailed information regarding causal factors of spatial disorientation, refer to Aerospace Medicine Spatial Disorientation and  Aerospace Medicine Reference Collection, which provides spatial disorientation videos. The videos are available online at:  www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters offices/avs/offices/aam/cami/library/online libraries/aerospace medicine/sd/videos/ .  

# Surprise and Startle Response  

Surprise is   an   unexpected   event that violates a pilot’s   expectations   and   can   affect the mental processes used   to   respond   to   the event.  Startle is an uncontrollable, automatic muscle reflex, raised heart rate, blood pressure, etc., elicited by exposure to a sudden, intense  event that violates a   pilot’s   expectations.  

This human response to unexpected events has traditionally been underestimated or even ignored during flight training. The reality is  that untrained pilots often experience a state of surprise or a startle response to an airplane upset event. Startle may or may not lead to  surprise. Pilots can protect themselves against a debilitating surprise reaction or startle response through scenario-based training, and  in such training, instructors can incorporate realistic distractions to help provoke startle or surprise. To be effective the controlled  training   scenarios   should   have a perception   of   risk   or   threat of   consequences   sufficient to   elevate the pilot’s   stress   levels. Such  scenarios can help prepare a pilot to mitigate psychological/physiological reactions to an actual upset.  

# Upset Prevention and Recovery Training (UPRT)  

Upsets are not intentional flight maneuvers, except in maneuver-based training; therefore, they are often unexpected. The reaction of  an inexperienced or inadequately trained pilot to an unexpected abnormal flight attitude is usually instinctive rather than intelligent  and deliberate. Such a pilot often reacts with abrupt muscular effort, which is without purpose and even hazardous in turbulent  conditions, at excessive speeds, or at low altitudes.  

Without proper upset recovery training on interpretation and airplane control, the pilot can quickly aggravate an abnormal flight  attitude into a potentially fatal LOC-I accident. Consequently, UPRT is intended to focus education and training on the prevention of  upsets, and on recovering from these events if they occur.  [Figure 5-1]  

![](images/107ff9f2976de9e2307f72bbbf52778f6a64fc0d6dbf3022a537a5f5b65458df.jpg)  
Figure 5-1.  Maneuvers that better prepare a pilot for understanding unusual attitudes and situations are representative of upset  training.  

⦁  Upset prevention refers to pilot actions to avoid a divergence from the desired airplane state.      Awareness and prevention training serve to avoid incidents. Early recognition of an upset scenario      coupled with appropriate preventive action often can mitigate a situation that could otherwise      escalate into an LOC-I accident.  

⦁  Recovery refers to pilot actions that return an airplane that is diverging in altitude, airspeed, or      attitude to a desired state from a developing or fully-developed upset. Recovery training serves to      reduce accidents as a result of an unavoidable or inadvertently-encountered upset event. The pilot      can learn to initiate a recovery to a normal flight mode immediately upon recognition of the      developing upset condition. The pilot should ensure that control inputs and power adjustments      applied to counter an upset are in direct proportion to the amount and rates of change of roll, yaw,      and pitch, or airspeed so as to avoid overstressing the airplane unless ground contact is imminent.  

# UPRT Training Core Concepts  

Airplane upsets are by nature time-critical events; they can also place pilots in unusual and unfamiliar attitudes that sometimes require  counter intuitive control movements. Upsets have the potential to put a pilot into a life-threatening situation compounded by panic,  diminished mental capacity, and potentially incapacitating spatial disorientation. Real-world upset situations often provide very little  time to react, but exposure to such events during training can reduce surprise and mitigate confusion during an actual unexpected  upset. The goal is to equip the pilot to promptly recognize an escalating threat pattern or sensory overload and quickly identify and  correct an impending upset.  

UPRT stresses that the first step is recognizing any time the airplane begins to diverge from the intended flightpath or airspeed. Pilots  need to identify and determine what, if any, action should be taken. As a general rule, any time visual cues or instrument indications  differ from basic flight maneuver expectations, the pilot should assume an upset and cross-check to confirm the attitude, instrument  error or instrument malfunction.  

To achieve maximum effect, it is crucial for UPRT concepts to be conveyed accurately and in a non-threatening manner. Reinforcing  concepts   through   positive experiences   significantly   improves a pilot’s   depth   of   understanding,   retention   of   skills,   and   desire for  continued training. Also, training in a carefully structured environment allows for exposure to these events and can help the pilot react  more quickly, decisively, and calmly when the unexpected occurs during flight. However, like many other skills, the skills needed for  upset prevention and recovery are perishable and thus require continuous reinforcement through training.  

UPRT in the airplane and flight simulation training device (FSTD) should be conducted in both visual and simulated instrument  conditions to allow pilots to practice recognition and recovery under both situations. UPRT should allow them to experience and  recognize some of the physiological factors related to each, such as the confusion and disorientation that can result from visual cues  in   an   upset event. Training   that includes recovery   from   bank   angles exceeding   90   degrees   could   further   add   to   a pilot’s   overall  knowledge and skills for upset recognition and recovery. For such training, additional measures should be taken to ensure the  suitability of the airplane or FSTD and that instructors are appropriately qualified.  

Upset prevention and recovery training is different from aerobatic training.  [Figure 5-2]  In aerobatic training, the pilot knows and  expects the maneuver, so effects of startle or surprise are missing. The main goal of aerobatic training is to teach pilots how to  intentionally and precisely maneuver an aerobatic-capable airplane in three dimensions. The primary goal of UPRT is to help pilots  overcome sudden onsets of stress to avoid, prevent, and recover from unplanned excursions that could lead to LOC-I.  

![Figure 5-2.  Some differences between aerobatic training and upset prevention and recovery training.  ](images/cafcbb7b0b865d17c3ccef99905ecacc38abd29793858c3b1ffd8451da7d0fe6.jpg)  

Comprehensive UPRT builds on three mutually supportive components: academics, airplane-based training and, typically at the  transport category type-rating training level, use of FSTDs. Each has unique benefits and limitations but, when implemented  cohesively and comprehensively throughout a pilot’s career, the components can offer maximum preparation for upset awareness,   prevention, recognition, and recovery.  

# Academic Material (Knowledge and Risk Management)  

Academics establish the foundation for development of situational awareness, insight, knowledge, and skills. As in practical skill  development, academic preparation should move from the general to specific while emphasizing the significance of each basic  concept. Although academic preparation is crucial and does offer a level of mitigation of the LOC-I threat, long-term retention of  knowledge is best achieved when applied and correlated with practical hands-on experience.  

The academic portion of UPRT should also address the prevention concepts surrounding aeronautical-decision making (ADM) and  risk management (RM), and proportional counter response.  

# Prevention Through ADM and Risk Management  

This element of prevention routinely occurs in a time scale of minutes or hours, revolving around the concept of effective ADM and  risk management through analysis, awareness, resource management, and interrupting the error chain through basic airmanship skills  and sound judgment. For instance, imagine a situation in which a pilot assesses conditions at an airport prior to descent and  recognizes those conditions as being too severe to safely land the airplane. Using situational awareness to avert a potentially  threatening flight condition is an example of prevention of an LOC-I situation through effective risk management. Pilots should  evaluate the circumstances for each flight (including the equipment and environment), looking specifically for scenarios that may  require a higher level of risk management. These include situations that could result in low-altitude maneuvering, steep turns in the  pattern, uncoordinated flight, or increased load factors.  

Another part of ADM is crew resource management (CRM) or single-pilot resource management (SRM). Both are relevant to the  UPRT environment. When available, a coordinated crew response to potential and developing upsets can provide added benefits such  as increased situational awareness, mutual support, and an improved margin of safety. Since an untrained crewmember can be the  most unpredictable element in an upset scenario, initial UPRT for crew operations should be mastered individually before being  integrated into a multi-crew, CRM environment. A crew should be able to accomplish the following:  

1.   Communicate and confirm the situation clearly and concisely;  2.   Transfer control to the most situationally-aware crewmember;  3.   Using standardized interactions, work as a team to enhance awareness, manage stress, and mitigate fear.  

# Prevention Through Proportional Counter-Response  

In simple terms, proportional counter-response is the timely manipulation of flight controls and thrust, either as the sole pilot or crew  as the situation dictates, to manage an airplane flight attitude or flight envelope excursion that was unintended or not commanded by  the pilot.  

The time-scale of this element of prevention typically occurs on the order of seconds or fractions of seconds, with the goal being the  ability to recognize a developing upset and take proportionally-appropriate avoidance actions to preclude the airplane entering a  fully-developed upset. Due to the sudden, surprising nature of this level of developing upset, there exists a high risk for panic and  overreaction to ensue and aggravate the situation.  

# Recovery  

Last but not least, the academics portion lays the foundation for development of UPRT skills by instilling the knowledge, procedures,  and techniques required to accomplish a safe recovery. The airplane and FSTD-based training elements presented below serve to  translate the academic material into structured practice. This can start with classroom visualization of recovery procedures and  continue with repetitive skill practiced in an airplane, and then potentially further developed in the simulated environment.  

In the event looking outside does not provide enough situational awareness of the airplane attitude, a pilot can use the flight  instruments to recognize and recover from an upset. To recover from nose-high and nose-low attitudes, the pilot should follow the  procedures recommended in the AFM/POH. In general, upset recovery procedures are summarized in  Figure 5-3.  

![](images/c6910b84e9f2659396ffa5ef62917d61227e344b87d0bf9530421b9a65cbe1d0.jpg)  
Figure 5-3.  Upset recovery template.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors associated with upset recoveries include the following:  

1. Incorrect assessment of what kind of upset the airplane is in  2. Failure to disconnect the wing leveler or autopilot  3. Failure to unload the airplane, if necessary  4. Failure to roll in the correct direction  5. Inappropriate management of the airspeed during the recovery  

# Roles of FSTDs and Airplanes in UPRT  

Training devices range from aviation training devices (e.g., basic and advanced) to FSTDs (e.g., flight training devices (FTD) and full  flight simulators (FFS)) and have a broad range of capabilities. While all of these devices have limitations relative to actual flight,  only the higher fidelity devices (i.e., Level C and D FFS) are a satisfactory substitution for developing UPRT skills in the actual  aircraft. Except for these higher fidelity devices, initial skill development should be accomplished in a suitable airplane, and the  accompanying training device should be used to build upon these skills.  [Figure 5-4]  

![](images/449586c5f5634746b6317f24ac009cf5afb6c8a464fa2ca967145fb0e6a720c8.jpg)

# Airplane-Based UPRT  

Ultimately, the more realistic the training scenario, the more indelible the learning experience. Although creating a visual scene of a   $110^{\circ}$   banked attitude with the nose   $30^{\circ}$   below the horizon may not be technically difficult in a modern simulator, the learning  achieved while viewing that scene from the security of the simulator is not as complete as when viewing the same scene in  an airplane. Maximum learning is achieved when the pilot is placed in the controlled, yet adrenaline-enhanced, environment of  upsets experienced while in flight. For these reasons, airplane-based UPRT improves a pilot’s ability to overcome fear in an airplane  upset event.  

However, airplane-based UPRT does have limitations. The level of upset training possible may be limited by the maneuvers approved  for the particular airplane, as well as by the flight instructor’s own UPRT capabilities. For instance, UPRT conducted in the   normal  category by a typical flight instructor will necessarily be different from UPRT conducted in the aerobatic category by a flight  instructor with expertise in aerobatics.  

When considering upset training conducted in an aerobatic-capable airplane in particular, the importance of employing instructors  with specialized UPRT experience in those airplanes cannot be overemphasized. Just as instrument or tailwheel instruction requires  specific skill sets for those operations, UPRT demands that instructors possess the competence to oversee trainee progress, and the  ability to intervene as necessary with consistency and professionalism. As in any area of training, the improper delivery of stall, spin,  and upset recovery training often results in negative learning, which could have severe consequences not only during the  training itself, but in the skills and mindset pilots take with them when they have passengers and place the lives of others at stake.  

# All-Attitude/All-Envelope Flight Training Methods  

Sound UPRT encompasses operation in a wide range of possible flight attitudes and covers the airplane’s limit flight envelope. This  training is essential to prepare pilots for unexpected upsets. As stated at the outset, the primary focus of a comprehensive  UPRT program is the avoidance of, and safe recovery from, upsets. Much like basic instrument skills, which can be applied to flying  a vast array of airplanes, the majority of skills and techniques required for upset recovery are not airplane-specific. Just as basic  instrument skills learned in lighter and lower performing airplanes are applied to more advanced airplanes, basic upset recovery  techniques provide lessons that remain with pilots throughout their flying careers.  

# FSTD–based UPRT  

UPRT can be effective in high fidelity devices (i.e., Level C and D FFS); however, instructors and pilots should be mindful of the  technical and physiological boundaries when using a particular FSTD for upset training. This training is a current requirement for  pilots seeking a multiengine airplane ATP certificate in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.156, and the training course must  be FAA approved.  

# Coordinated Flight  

Coordinated flight occurs whenever the pilot is proactively correcting for yaw effects associated with power (engine/  propeller effects), aileron inputs, how an airplane reacts when turning, and airplane rigging. The airplane is in coordinated flight  when the airplane’s nose is yawed directly into the relative wind and the ball is centered in the slip/skid indicator (except  for certain multiengine airplane operation with an engine failure).  [Figure 5-5]  

![](images/3e074cb42e3d4ba73400aab970ff991bca3ca6105ddece9407b560d14c331ac0.jpg)  
Figure 5-5.  Coordinated flight in a turn.  

# Angle of Attack  

The angle of attack (AOA) is the angle at which the chord of the wing meets the relative wind. The chord is a straight line from the  leading edge to the trailing edge. At low angles of attack, the airflow over the top of the wing flows smoothly and produces lift with a  relatively small amount of drag. As the AOA increases, lift as well as drag increases; however, above a wing’s critical AOA, the flow  of air separates from the upper surface and backfills, burbles, and eddies, which reduces lift and increases drag. This condition is a  stall, which can lead to loss of control if the AOA is not reduced.  

It is important for the pilot to understand that a stall is the result of exceeding the critical AOA, not of insufficient airspeed. The term  “stalling speed” can be misleading, as this speed is often discussed when assuming 1G flight at a particular weight and configuration.  Increased load factor directly affects stall speed (as well as do other factors such as gross weight, center of gravity, and flap setting).  Therefore, it is possible to stall the wing at any airspeed, at any flight attitude, and at any power setting. For example, if a  pilot maintains airspeed and rolls into a coordinated, level  $60^{\circ}$   banked turn, the load factor is 2G, and the airplane will stall at a speed  that is 41 percent higher than the 1G stall speed. In that 2G level turn, the pilot has to increase AOA to increase the lift  required to maintain altitude. At this condition, the pilot is closer to the critical AOA than during level flight and therefore closer  to the higher stalling   speed. Because “stalling speed” is not a constant number, pilots need to understand the underlying factors  that affect it in order to maintain aircraft control in all circumstances.  

# Slow Flight  

Flying at reduced airspeeds is normal in the takeoff/departure and approach/landing phases of flight. While pilots typically perform  these operations at low airspeeds and close to the ground, pilots learn to maneuver an airplane in slow flight at a safe altitude. During  slow flight, any further increase in angle of attack, increase in load factor, or reduction in power, will result in a stall warning (e.g.,  aircraft buffet, stall horn, etc.), and pilots should react to and correct for any stall indication. Note that stall training builds upon the  knowledge and skill acquired from the slow flight maneuver and encompasses the period of time from the stall warning (e.g., aircraft  buffet, stall horn, etc.) to the stall.  

The objective of maneuvering in slow flight is to develop the pilot’s ability to fly at low speeds and high AOAs. Through practice, the  pilot becomes familiar with the feel, sound, and visual cues of flight in this regime, where there is a degraded response to  control inputs and where it is more difficult to maintain a selected altitude. It is essential that pilots:  

1. understand the aerodynamics associated with slow flight in various aircraft configurations and attitudes,  2. recognize airplane cues in these flight conditions,  3. smoothly manage coordinated flight control inputs while maneuvering without a stall warning, and  4. make prompt appropriate correction should a stall warning occur.  

For pilot training and testing purposes, slow flight includes two main elements:  

⦁  Slowing to, maneuvering at, and recovering from an airspeed at which the airplane is still capable of      maintaining controlled flight without activating the stall warning—5 to 10 knots above the 1G stall      speed is a good target.  

⦁  Performing slow flight in configurations appropriate to takeoffs, climbs, descents, approaches to      landing, and go-arounds.  

Slow flight should be introduced with the target airspeed sufficiently above the stall to permit safe maneuvering, but close enough to  the stall warning for the pilot to experience the characteristics of flight at a low airspeed. One way to determine the target airspeed is  to slow the aircraft to the stall warning when in the desired slow flight configuration, pitch the nose down slightly to eliminate the  stall warning, and add power to maintain altitude and note the airspeed.  

When practicing slow flight, a pilot learns to divide attention between aircraft control and other demands. How the airplane feels at  the slower airspeeds demonstrates that as airspeed decreases, control effectiveness decreases. For instance, reducing airspeed from  30 knots to 20 knots above the stalling speed will result in a certain loss of effectiveness of flight control inputs because of less  airflow over the control surfaces. As airspeed is further reduced, the control effectiveness is further reduced and the reduced airflow  over the control surfaces results in larger control movements being required to create the same response. Pilots sometimes refer to the  feel of   this   reduced   effectiveness   as “sloppy” or   “mushy” controls.  

When flying above the minimum drag speed   $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$  , more power is required to fly even faster. When flying at speeds below   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , more power is required to fly even slower. Since slow flight will be performed well below   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , the pilot should be aware  that large power inputs or a reduction in AOA will be required to prevent the aircraft from decelerating. It is important to note that  when flying below   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$    or  on the backside of the power curve , as the AOA increases toward the critical AOA and the  airplane’s speed continues to decrease, small changes in the pitch control result in d is proportionally large changes in induced drag  and therefore changes in airspeed. As a result, pitch becomes a more effective control of airspeed when flying below   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$    and  power is an effective control of the path.  

It is also important to note that an airplane flying below   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , exhibits a characteristic known as “speed instability” and   the  airspeed will continue to decay without appropriate pilot action. For example, if the airplane is disturbed by turbulence and the  airspeed decreases, the airspeed may continue to decrease without the appropriate pilot action of reducing the AOA or adding power.  [Figure 5-6]  

![](images/24f00eeb4e7ae00da9f92f88585bfa213f1a898b0d29b813091e2f8415a352cd.jpg)

# Performing the Slow Flight Maneuver  

Slow flight training includes:  

⦁  Slowing the airplane smoothly and promptly from cruising to approach speeds without changes in altitude  or heading, while  increasing the angle of attack and   setting the required power and trim.  ⦁  Configuration changes, such as extending the landing gear and adding flaps, while maintaining heading and      altitude.  ⦁  Turning while maintaining altitude.  ⦁  Straight-ahead climbs and climbing medium-banked (approximately 20 degrees) turns, and straight-ahead      power-off gliding descents and descending turns, which represent the takeoff and landing phases of flight.  

Slow flight in a single-engine airplane should be conducted so the maneuver can be completed no lower than 1,500 feet AGL (3,000  for multiengine airplanes), or higher, if recommended by the manufacturer. In all cases, practicing slow flight should be conducted at  an adequate height above the ground for recovery should the airplane inadvertently stall.  

To begin the slow flight maneuver, the pilot should clear the area and gradually reduce thrust from cruise power and adjust the pitch  to allow the airspeed to decrease while maintaining altitude. As the speed of the airplane decreases, there is a change in the sound of  the airflow. As the speed approaches the target slow flight speed, which is an airspeed just above the stall warning in the desired  configuration (i.e., approximately 5–10 knots above the stall speed for that flight condition), additional power will be needed to  maintain altitude. During these changing flight conditions, the pilot should trim the airplane to compensate for changes in control  pressures. If the airplane remains trimmed at the pre-maneuver cruising speed, strong aft (back) control pressure is needed on the  elevator, which will make precise control difficult.  

Slow flight is typically performed and evaluated in the landing configuration. Therefore, both the landing gear and the flaps should be  extended to the landing position, as applicable. It is recommended the prescribed before-landing checks be completed to configure  the airplane. The extension of gear and flaps typically occurs once cruise power has been reduced and at appropriate airspeeds to  ensure limitations for extending those devices are not exceeded. Practicing this maneuver in other configurations, such as a clean or  takeoff configuration, is also good training and may be evaluated on the practical test.  

With an AOA just under the AOA which may cause an aerodynamic buffet or stall warning, the flight controls are less effective.  [Figure 5-7]  The elevator control is less responsive and larger control movements are necessary to retain control of the airplane. In  propeller-driven airplanes, torque, slipstream effect, and P-factor may produce a strong left yaw, which requires right rudder input to  maintain coordinated flight. The closer the airplane is to the 1G stall, the greater the amount of right rudder pressure required.  

![](images/db77f4fd77e3f5a5ef331f3463ec54da0c715e08394839a936178571b70af9e4.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.  Slow flight—low airspeed, high angle of attack, high power, and constant altitude.  

# Maneuvering in Slow Flight  

When the desired pitch attitude and airspeed have been established in straight-and-level slow flight, the pilot needs to maintain  awareness of outside references and continually cross-check   the airplane’s   instruments   to   maintain   control. The pilot should   note the  feel of the flight controls, especially the airspeed changes caused by small pitch adjustments, and the altitude changes caused by  power   changes. The pilot should   practice turns   to   determine the airplane’s   controllability   characteristics   at this   low   speed.   During the  turns, it will be necessary to increase power to maintain altitude. Abrupt or rough control movements during slow flight may result in  a stall. For instance, abruptly raising the flaps while in slow flight can cause the plane to stall.  

The pilot should also practice climbs and descents by adjusting the power when stabilized in straight-and-level slow flight. The pilot  should note the increased yawing tendency at high power settings and counter it with rudder input as needed.  

To exit the slow flight maneuver, add power. As airspeed and lift increase, apply forward control pressure to reduce the AOA and  maintain altitude. Maintain coordinated flight, level the wings as necessary, and return to the desired flightpath. As airspeed increases,  clean up the airplane by retracting flaps and landing gear, if they were extended, and adjust trim as needed. A pilot should anticipate  the changes to the AOA as the landing gear and flaps are retracted to avoid a stall.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of slow flight are:  

1. Failure to adequately clear the area  2. Inadequate back-elevator pressure as power is reduced, resulting in altitude loss  3. Excessive back-elevator pressure as power is reduced, resulting in a climb followed by rapid reduction in airspeed  4. Insufficient right rudder to compensate for left yaw  5. Fixation on the flight instruments  6. Failure to anticipate changes in AOA as flaps are extended or retracted  7. Inadequate power management  8. Inability to adequately divide attention between airplane control and orientation  9. Failure to properly trim the airplane  10. Failure to respond to a stall warning  

# Stalls  

A   stall is   an   aerodynamic condition   which   occurs   when   smooth   airflow   over   the airplane’s   wings    disrupted,   resulting    loss of lift.  Specifically, a stall occurs when the AOA—the angle between the chord line of the wing and the relative wind—exceeds   the wing’s critical AOA. It is possible to exceed the critical AOA at any airspeed, at any attitude, and at any power setting.  [Figure 5-8]  

![](images/0f71cd42fc409a13dae1dbaa73a6d3cf8a823d380d14b971168991c6c3b62a1b.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.  Critical angle of attack and stall.  

For these reasons, it is important to understand factors and situations that can lead to a stall, and develop proficiency in stall  recognition and recovery. Performing intentional stalls will familiarize the pilot with the conditions that result in a stall, assist in  recognition of an impending stall, and develop the proper corrective response if a stall occurs. Stalls are practiced to two different  levels:  

⦁  Impending Stall—an impending stall occurs when the AOA causes a stall warning, but has not yet reached      the critical AOA. Indications of an impending stall can include buffeting, stick shaker, or aural warning.  

⦁  Full Stall—a full stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded. Indications of a full stall are typically that      an uncommanded nose down pitch cannot be readily arrested, and may be accompanied by an uncommanded      rolling motion. For airplanes equipped with stick pushers, their activation is also an indicator of a full stall.  

Although it depends on the degree to which a stall has progressed, some loss of altitude is expected during recovery. The longer it  takes for the pilot to recognize an impending stall, the more likely it is that a full stall will result. Intentional stalls should therefore be  performed at an altitude that provides adequate height above the ground for recovery and return to normal level flight.  

# Stall Recognition  

A pilot should recognize the flight conditions that are conducive to stalls and know how to apply the necessary corrective action. This  level of proficiency involves learning to recognize an impending stall by sight, sound, and feel.  

Stalls are usually accompanied by a continuous stall warning for airplanes equipped with stall warning devices. These devices  may include an aural alert, lights, or a stick shaker all which alert the pilot when approaching the critical AOA. Most vintage  airplanes, and many types of light-sport and experimental airplanes, do not have stall warning devices installed. However,  certification standards permit manufacturers to provide the required stall warning either through the inherent aerodynamic qualities of  the airplane (pre-stall buffeting) or through a stall warning device that gives a clear indication of the impending stall.  

Other sensory cues for the pilot include:  

⦁  Feel—the pilot will feel control pressures change as speed is reduced. With progressively less resistance      on the control surfaces, the pilot needs to use larger control movements to get the desired airplane      response.   The pilot will notice the airplane’s   reaction   time to   control movement increases.  ⦁  Vision—since the airplane can be stalled in any attitude, vision is not a foolproof indicator of an impending      stall. However, maintaining pitch awareness is important.  ⦁  Hearing—as speed decreases, the pilot should notice a change in sound made by the air flowing along the      airplane structure.  ⦁  Kinesthesia—the physical sensation   (sometimes referred    as “seat of   the pants” sensations)   of   changes in       direction or speed is an important indicator to the trained and experienced pilot in visual flight. If this      sensitivity is properly developed, it can warn the pilot of an impending stall.  

Pilots should remember that a level-flight 1G published stalling speed is valid only:  

1.   In unaccelerated 1G flight  2.   In coordinated flight (slip-skid indicator centered)  3.   At one weight (typically maximum gross weight)  4.   At a particular center of gravity (CG) (typically maximum forward CG)  

# Angle of Attack Indicators  

An AOA indicator gives the pilot better situational awareness pertaining to the aerodynamic health of the airfoil. This can be referred  to as stall margin awareness or knowing the existing margin between the current AOA and the critical AOA. While learning to  recognize stalls without relying on stall warning devices is important, an AOA indicator provides an additional visual indication of  the airplane’s proximity to the critical AOA. The FAA along with the General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) is  promoting the use of Angle of Attack (AOA) indicators to reduce the occurrence of loss of control in flight.  

Without an AOA indicator, the AOA is “invisible” to pilots. These devices measure several parameters simultaneously and determine  the current angle of attack providing a visual image to the pilot of the current AOA along with representation of the proximity to the  critical AOA. These devices can give a visual representation of the energy management state of the airplane. The energy state of an  airplane is the balance between airspeed, altitude, drag, and thrust and represents how efficiently the airfoil is operating. With this  increased situational awareness pertaining to the energy condition of the airplane, the pilot has additional information to help prevent a  loss of control scenario.  

AOA indicators are increasingly affordable for GA airplanes. There are several different kinds of AOA indicators with varying  methods for calculating AOA; therefore, proper installation and training on the use of these devices is important. AOA indicators  measure several parameters simultaneously, determine the current AOA, and provide a visual image of the proximity to the critical  AOA.  [Figure 5-9]  Some AOA indicators also provide aural indications, which can provide awareness to a change in AOA that is  trending towards the critical AOA prior to installed stall warning systems. It’s important to note that some indicators take flap  position into consideration, but not all do.  

While AOA indicators provide a simple visual representation of the current AOA and its proximity to the critical AOA, they are not  without their limitations. These limitations should be understood by operators of GA airplanes equipped with these devices. Like  advanced automation such as autopilots and moving maps, the misunderstanding or misuse of the equipment can have disastrous  results. Some items that may limit the effectiveness of an AOA indicator are listed below:  

1. Calibration techniques  2. Probes or vanes not being heated  3. The type of indicator itself  4. Flap setting  5. Wing contamination

Figure 5-9.  A conceptual representation of an AOA indicator. It is important to become familiar with the equipment installed in a  specific airplane.  

Installation of AOA indicators not required by type certification in GA airplanes has been streamlined by the FAA. The FAA  established policy in February 2014 pertaining to non-required AOA systems and how they may be installed as a minor alteration,  depending upon their installation requirements and operational utilization, and the procedures to follow for certification of these  installations. For updated information on this, please reference the FAA website at  www.faa.gov .  

If airplane equipment includes an angle of attack indicator, the pilot should know how the particular device determines AOA, what  the display indicates, and the appropriate response to any indication. Pilots are encouraged to conduct in-flight training to see the  indications throughout various maneuvers, such as slow flight, stalls, takeoffs, and landings, and to practice the appropriate responses  to those indications. It is also important to note that some items may limit the effectiveness of an AOA indicator (e.g., calibration  techniques, wing contamination, unheated probes/vanes). Pilots flying an airplane equipped with an AOA indicator should refer to the  pilot handbook information or contact the manufacturer for specific limitations applicable to that indicator type.  

Ground and flight instructors should make every attempt to receive training from an instructor knowledgeable about AOA indicators  prior to giving instruction pertaining to or in airplanes equipped with an AOA indicator. Pilot schools should incorporate training on  AOA indicators in their syllabi whether their training aircraft are equipped with them or not.  

# Stall Characteristics  

Different airplane designs can result in different stall characteristics. The pilot should know the stall characteristics of the airplane  being   flown   and   the manufacturer’s   recommended   recovery   procedures. Factors   that can   affect the stall characteristics   of   an   airplane  include its geometry, CG, wing design, and high-lift devices. Engineering design variations make it impossible to specifically  describe the stall characteristics for all airplanes; however, there are enough similarities in small general aviation training-type  airplanes to offer broad guidelines.  

Most training airplanes are designed so that the wings stall progressively outward from the wing roots (where the wing attaches to the  fuselage) to the wingtips. Some wings are manufactured with a certain amount of twist, known as washout, resulting in the outboard  portion of the wings having a slightly lower AOA than the wing roots. This design feature causes the wingtips to have a smaller AOA  during flight than the wing roots. Thus, the wing roots of an airplane exceed the critical AOA before the wingtips, meaning the wing  roots stall first. Therefore, when the airplane is in a stalled condition, the ailerons should still have a degree of control effectiveness  until/unless stalled airflow migrates outward along the wings. Although airflow may still be attached at the wingtips, a pilot should  exercise caution using the ailerons prior to the reduction of the AOA because it can exacerbate the stalled condition. For example, if  the airplane rolls   left at the stall (“rolls-off”),   and   the pilot applies   right aileron   to   try   to   level the wing,   the downward-deflected  aileron on the left wing produces a greater AOA (and more induced drag), and a more complete stall at the tip as the critical AOA is  exceeded. This can cause the wing to roll even more to the left, which is why it is important to first reduce the AOA before attempting  to roll the airplane.  

The pilot should also understand how the factors that affect stalls are interrelated. In a power-off stall, for instance, the cues  (buffeting, shaking) are less noticeable than in the power-on stall. In the power-off, 1G stall, the predominant cue may be the elevator  control position (full up elevator against the stops) and a high descent rate.  

# Fundamentals of Stall Recovery  

Depending on the complexity of the airplane, stall recovery could consist of as many as six steps. Even so, the pilot should remember  the most important action to an impending stall or a full stall is to reduce the AOA. There have been numerous situations where pilots  did not first reduce AOA, and instead prioritized power and maintaining altitude, which resulted in a loss of control. This section  provides a generic stall recovery procedure for light general aviation aircraft adapted from a template developed by major airplane  manufacturers and can be adjusted appropriately for the aircraft used.  [Figure 5-10]  However, a pilot should always follow the  aircraft-specific manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures if   published   and   current.  

![Figure 5-10.  Stall recovery template.  ](images/d694f58f9fae05938e2678e77860386087c267bbe25ef9a0ce843432ff0c95b5.jpg)  

The recovery actions should be made in a procedural manner; they can be summarized in  Figure 5-10.  The following discussion  explains each of the six steps:  

1. Disconnect the wing leveler or autopilot (if equipped). Manual control is essential to recovery in all  situations. Disconnecting this equipment should be done immediately and allow the pilot to move to the  next crucial step quickly. Leaving the wing leveler or autopilot connected may result in inadvertent  changes or adjustments to the flight controls or trim that may not be easily recognized or appropriate,  especially during high workload situations.  2. a) Pitch nose-down control. Reducing the AOA is crucial for all stall recoveries. Push forward on the           flight controls to reduce the AOA below the critical AOA until the impending stall indications are           eliminated before proceeding to the next step.  b) Trim nose-down pitch. If the elevator does not provide the needed response, pitch trim may be  necessary. However, excessive use of pitch trim may aggravate the condition, or may result in loss of  control or high structural loads.  3. Roll wings level. This orients the lift vector properly for an effective recovery. It is important not to be  tempted to control the bank angle prior to reducing AOA. Both roll stability and roll control will improve  considerably after getting the wings flying again. It is also imperative to proactively cancel yaw with proper  use of the rudder to prevent a stall from progressing into a spin.  4. Add thrust/power. Power should be added as needed, as stalls can occur at high power or low power  settings or at high airspeeds or low airspeeds. Advance the throttle promptly, but smoothly, as needed  while using rudder and elevator controls to stop any yawing motion and prevent any undesirable pitching  motion. Adding power typically reduces the loss of altitude during a stall recovery, but it does not  eliminate a stall. The reduction in AOA is imperative. For propeller-driven airplanes, power application  increases the airflow around the wing, assisting in stall recovery.  5. Retract speedbrakes/spoilers (if equipped). This will improve lift and the stall margin.  6. Return to the desired flightpath. Apply smooth and coordinated flight control movements to return  

the airplane to the desired flightpath being careful to avoid a secondary stall. However, be  situationally aware of the proximity to terrain during the recovery and take the necessary flight  control action to avoid contact with it.  

The above procedure can be adapted for the type of aircraft flown. For example, a single-engine training airplane without an autopilot  would likely only use four of the six steps. The first step is not applicable. The actual first step is the reduction of the AOA until the  stall warning is eliminated. Use of pitch trim is less of a concern in a training airplane because most pilots can overpower the trim in  these airplanes. Any improper trim can be corrected when returning to the desired flightpath. The next step is rolling the wings level  followed by the addition of power as needed all while maintaining coordinated flight. If the airplane is not equipped with speedbrakes  or spoilers, this step is also skipped. Returning to the desired flightpath concludes the recovery.  

Similarly, a glider pilot does not have an autopilot; therefore, the first step is the reduction of AOA until the stall warning is  eliminated. The pilot would then roll wings level while maintaining coordinated flight. Since there is no power to add, this step would  not apply. Retracting speedbrakes or spoilers would be the next step for a glider pilot followed by returning to the desired flightpath.  

# Stall Training  

Practice in both power-on and power-off stalls is important because it simulates stall conditions that could occur during normal flight  maneuvers. It is important for pilots to understand the possible flight scenarios in which a stall could occur. Stall accidents usually  result from an inadvertent stall at a low altitude, with the recovery not completed prior to ground contact. For example, power-on  stalls   are practiced   to   develop   the pilot’s   awareness   of   what could   happen    the airplane is   pitched   to   an   excessively   nose-high  attitude immediately after takeoff, during a climbing turn, or when trying to clear an obstacle. Power-off turning stalls develop the  pilot’s   awareness   of   what could   happen    the controls   are improperly   used   during   a turn   from   the base leg   to   the final approach. The  power-off straight-ahead stall simulates the stall that could occur when trying to stretch a glide after the engine has failed, or if low on  the approach to landing.  

As in all maneuvers that involve significant changes in altitude or direction, the pilot should ensure that the area is clear of other air  traffic at and below their altitude and that sufficient altitude is available for a recovery before executing the maneuver. It is  recommended that stalls be practiced at an altitude that allows recovery no lower than 1,500 feet AGL for single-engine airplanes, or  higher if recommended by the AFM/POH. Losing altitude during recovery from a stall is to be expected.  

# Approaches to Stalls (Impending Stalls), Power-On or Power-Off  

An impending stall occurs when the airplane is approaching, but does not exceed the critical AOA. The purpose of practicing  impending stalls is to learn to retain or regain full control of the airplane immediately upon recognizing that it is nearing a stall, or  that a stall is likely to occur if the pilot does not take appropriate action. Pilot training should emphasize teaching the same recovery  technique for impending stalls and full stalls.  

The practice of impending stalls is of particular value in developing the pilot’s sense of feel for executing maneuvers in which  maximum airplane performance is required. These maneuvers require flight in which the airplane approaches a stall, but the pilot  initiates recovery at the first indication, such as by a stall warning device activation.  

Impending stalls may be entered and performed in the same attitudes and configurations as the full stalls or other maneuvers  described in this chapter. However, instead of allowing the airplane to reach the critical AOA, the pilot should immediately reduce  AOA once the stall warning device goes off, if installed, or recognizes other cues such as buffeting. The pilot should hold the nose- down control input as required to eliminate the stall warning. Then level the wings maintain coordinated flight, and then apply  whatever additional power is necessary to return to the desired flightpath. The pilot will have recovered once the airplane has returned  to the desired flightpath with sufficient airspeed and adequate flight control effectiveness and no stall warning. Performance of the  impending stall maneuver is unsatisfactory if a full stall occurs, if an excessively low pitch attitude is attained, or if the pilot fails to  take timely action to avoid excessive airspeed, excessive loss of altitude, or a spin.  

# Full Stalls, Power-Off  

The practice of power-off stalls is usually performed with normal landing approach conditions to simulate an accidental stall  occurring during approach to landing. However, power-off stalls should be practiced at all flap settings to ensure familiarity with  handling arising from mechanical failures, icing, or other abnormal situations. Airspeed in excess of the normal approach speed  should not be carried into a stall entry since it could result in an abnormally nose-high attitude.  

To set up the entry for a straight-ahead power-off stall, airplanes equipped with flaps or retractable landing gear should be in the  landing configuration. After extending the landing gear, applying carburetor heat (if applicable), and retarding the throttle  sufficiently, the pilot holds the airplane at a constant altitude until the airspeed decelerates to normal approach speed. The airplane  should then be smoothly pitched down to a normal approach attitude to maintain that airspeed. Wing flaps should be extended and  pitch attitude adjusted to maintain the airspeed. Once in a normal approach, the pilot sets the power to idle.  

When the approach attitude and airspeed have stabilized, the pilot should smoothly raise the airplane’s nose to an attitude that induces  a stall. Directional control should be maintained and wings held level by coordinated use of the ailerons and rudder. Once the airplane  reaches an attitude that will lead to a stall, the pitch attitude is maintained with the elevator until the stall occurs. The stall is  recognized by the full-stall cues previously described.  

Recovery from the stall is accomplished by reducing the AOA, applying as much nose-down control input as required to eliminate the  stall warning, leveling the wings, maintaining coordinated flight, and then applying power as needed. Right rudder pressure may be  necessary to overcome the engine torque effects as power is advanced and the nose is being lowered.  [Figure 5-11]  If simulating an  inadvertent stall on approach to landing, the pilot should initiate a go-around by establishing a positive rate of climb. Once in a climb,  the flaps and landing gear should be retracted as necessary.  

![](images/d8cc28903f682aa6b305740577f15c70d1e80d8a395b10b9b9e27ae4ee4c87a7.jpg)  
Figure 5-11.  Power-off stall and recovery.  

Recovery from power-off stalls should also be practiced from shallow banked turns to simulate an inadvertent stall during a turn from  base leg to final approach. During the practice of these stalls, the pilot should take care to ensure that the airplane remains  coordinated and the turn continues at a constant bank angle until the full stall occurs. If the airplane is allowed to slip, the outer wing  may stall first and move downward abruptly. In a skid, the bank angle may increase further to a potentially dangerous attitude. The  recovery procedure is the same, regardless of whether one wing rolls off first. The pilot should apply as much nose-down control  input as necessary to eliminate the stall warning, level the wings with ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and add power as needed. In  the practice of turning stalls, no attempt should be made to stall or recover the airplane on a predetermined heading. However, to  simulate a turn from base to final approach, the stall normally should be made to occur within a heading change of approximately   $90^{\circ}$  .  

# Full Stalls, Power-On  

Power-on stall recoveries are practiced from straight climbs and climbing turns (  $15^{\circ}$   to   $20^{\circ}$   bank) to help the pilot recognize the  potential for an accidental stall during takeoff, go around, climb, or when trying to clear an obstacle. Airplanes equipped with flaps or  retractable landing gear should normally be in the takeoff configuration; however, power-on stalls should also be practiced with the  airplane in a clean configuration (flaps and gear retracted) to ensure practice with all possible takeoff and climb configurations. When  practicing takeoff stall recovery, the airplane should be at maximum power, although for some airplanes it may be reduced to a setting  that will prevent an excessively high pitch attitude.  

To set up the entry for power-on stalls, the pilot establishes the airplane in the takeoff or climb configuration and slows the airplane to  normal lift-off speed while continuing to clear the area of other traffic. Upon reaching the desired speed, the pilot sets takeoff power  or the recommended climb power for the power-on stall (often referred to as a departure stall) while establishing a climb attitude. The  purpose of reducing the airspeed to lift-off airspeed before the throttle is advanced to the recommended setting is to avoid an  excessively steep nose-up attitude for a long period before the airplane stalls.  

After establishing the climb attitude, the pilot should smoothly raise the nose to increase the AOA, and hold that attitude until the full  stall occurs. As described in connection with the stall characteristics discussion, continual adjustments should be made to aileron  pressure, elevator pressure, and rudder pressure to maintain coordinated flight while holding the attitude until the full stall occurs. In  most airplanes, as the airspeed decreases the pilot should move the elevator control progressively further back while simultaneously  adding right rudder and maintaining the climb attitude until reaching the full stall.  

The pilot should recognize when the stall has occurred and take action without delay to prevent a prolonged stalled condition. The  pilot should recover from the stall by immediately reducing the AOA and applying as much nose-down control input as required to  eliminate the stall warning, level the wings with ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and smoothly advance the power as needed. Since  the throttle is already at the climb power setting, this step may simply mean confirming the proper power setting.  [Figure 5-12]  

![](images/2208df85e6bf43072f9d8ae32340fff7add8d2d588e75ef9e2117629789444e3.jpg)  

The final step is to return the airplane to the desired flightpath (e.g., straight and level or departure/climb attitude). With sufficient  airspeed and control effectiveness, the pilot may return the throttle to the appropriate power setting.  

# Secondary Stall  

A secondary stall is so named because it occurs after recovery from a preceding stall. A normal recovery usually involves pointing the  nose of the airplane toward the ground. However, if a stall should occur at low altitude, the pilot's natural impulse is to bring the nose  up as soon as possible and to do so abruptly. This reaction is amplified as proximity to the ground increases. To demonstrate how this  occurs at altitude, the pilot makes an abrupt recovery after one stall and exceeds the critical AOA a second time. Note that this stall  may occur after any stall when the pilot does not sufficiently reduce the AOA by lowering the pitch attitude or attempts to break the  stall by using power only.  [Figure 5-13]  

![](images/3da86b7fb75de74070d051c510c70c2936eed2ff03d1a692fc38ba9469d5b388.jpg)  
Figure 5-13.  Secondary stall.  

If a secondary stall occurs, the pilot should again perform the stall recovery procedures by applying nose-down elevator pressure as  required to eliminate the stall warning, level the wings with ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and adjust power as needed. When the  airplane is no longer in a stalled condition the pilot can return the airplane to the desired flightpath. For pilot certification, this is a  demonstration-only maneuver. Only flight instructor applicants may be required to perform it on a practical test.  

# Accelerated Stalls  

While pilots may understand the cause of an accelerated stall, it takes training to experience how these stalls develop and occur. The  objectives of demonstrating an accelerated stall are to determine the stall characteristics of the airplane, experience stalls at speeds  greater than the +1G stall speed, and develop the ability to instinctively recover at the onset of such stalls. This is a maneuver only  commercial pilot and flight instructor applicants may be required to perform or demonstrate on a practical test. However, all pilots  should be familiar with the situations that can cause an accelerated stall, how to recognize this type of stall, and how to execute the  appropriate recovery should one occur.  

At the same gross weight, airplane configuration, CG location, power setting, and environmental conditions, a given airplane  consistently stalls at the same indicated airspeed provided the airplane is at  $+1\mathrm{G}$   (i.e., steady-state unaccelerated flight). However, the  airplane can also stall at a higher indicated airspeed when the airplane is subject to an acceleration greater than   $+1\mathrm{G}$  , such as when  turning, pulling up, or other abrupt changes in flightpath. Stalls encountered any time the G-load   exceeds   +1G are called   “accelerated   maneuver   stalls.”   The   accelerated   stall   would   most   frequently   occur   inadvertently   during   improperly   executed   turns,   stall   and   spin  recoveries, pullouts from steep dives, or when overshooting a base to final turn. An accelerated stall is typically demonstrated during  steep turns.  

A pilot should never practice accelerated stalls with wing flaps in the extended position due to the lower design G-load limitations in  that configuration. Accelerated stalls should be performed with a bank of approximately   $45^{\circ}$  , and in no case at a speed greater than  the airplane manufacturer’s recommended airspeed, or the specified design maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$   or operating maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{O})}$  .  

It is important to be familiar with   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  , how it relates to accelerated stalls, and how it changes depending on the airplane's  weight.   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    is the maximum speed at which the positive design load limit can be imposed either by gusts or full one-sided deflection  with one control surface without causing structural damage.   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$    is a historical operating limitation applicable to certain airplanes  only. It represents the maximum speed where, at any given weight, the pilot may apply full control excursion without exceeding the  design limit load factor.  Performing accelerated stalls at speeds up to the applicable   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  , ensures the airplane will reach the  critical AOA, which unloads the wing, before exceeding the design load limit. At speeds above   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  , the airplane can reach its  design load limit at less than the critical AOA. This condition makes it possible to add additional load and overstress the airplane.  Additional information on the effects of aircraft weight on stall speeds and structural limits while maneuvering is available in the  "Aerodynamics of Flight" chapter of the  Pilot’s   Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25).  

There are two methods for performing an accelerated stall. The most common accelerated stall procedure starts from straight-and­ level flight at an airspeed at or below   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  . The pilot rolls the airplane into a coordinated, level-flight   $45^{\circ}$   turn and then  smoothly, firmly, and progressively increase the AOA through back elevator pressure until a stall occurs. Alternatively, the pilot rolls  the airplane into a coordinated, level-flight   $45^{\circ}$   turn at an airspeed above   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  . After the airspeed slows to   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  , and at an  airspeed 5 to 10 percent faster than the unaccelerated stall speed, the pilot progressively increases the AOA through back elevator  pressure until a stall occurs. The increased back elevator pressure increases lift and the G load. The G load pushes the pilot’s   body   down in the seat. The increased lift also increases drag, which may cause the airspeed to decrease. The pilot should know the  published stall speed for 45° of bank, flaps up, before performing the maneuver. This speed is typically published in the AFM.  

An airplane typically stalls during a level, coordinated turn similar to the way it does in wings-level flight, except that the stall buffet  can   be sharper.    the turn    coordinated   at the time of   the stall, the airplane’s   nose pitches away   from   the pilot just as it does in a  wings-level stall since both wings will tend to stall nearly simultaneously. If the airplane is not properly coordinated at the time of  stall, the stall behavior may include a change in bank angle until the AOA has been reduced. It is important to take recovery action at  the first indication of a stall (if impending stall training/checking) or immediately after the stall has fully developed (if full stall  training/checking) by applying forward elevator pressure as required to reduce the AOA and to eliminate the stall warning, level the  wings using ailerons, coordinate with rudder, and adjust power as necessary. Stalls that result from abrupt maneuvers tend to be more  aggressive than unaccelerated +1G stalls. Because they occur at higher-than-normal airspeeds or may occur at lower-than-anticipated  pitch attitudes, they can surprise an inexperienced pilot. Since an accelerated stall may put the airplane in an unexpected attitude.  Failure to execute an immediate recovery may result in a spin or other departure from controlled flight.  

# Cross-Control Stall  

The objective of the cross-control stall demonstration is to show the effects of uncoordinated flight on stall behavior and to emphasize  the importance of maintaining coordinated flight while making turns. This is a demonstration-only maneuver; only flight instructor  applicants may be required to perform it on a practical test. However, all pilots should be familiar with the situations that can lead to a  cross-control stall, how to recognize and avoid this stall, and how to recover should one occur.  

The aerodynamic effects of the uncoordinated, cross-control stall can surprise the unwary pilot because this stall can occur with very  little warning and can be deadly if it occurs close to the ground. The nose may pitch down, the bank angle may suddenly change, and  the airplane may continue to roll to an inverted orientation, which is usually the beginning of a spin. It is therefore essential for the  pilot to follow the stall recovery procedure by reducing the AOA until the stall warning has been eliminated, then roll wings level  using ailerons, and coordinate with rudder inputs before the airplane enters a spiral or spin.  

A cross-control stall occurs when the critical AOA is exceeded with aileron pressure applied in one direction and rudder pressure in  the opposite direction, causing uncoordinated flight. A skidding cross-control stall is most likely to occur in the traffic pattern during  a poorly planned and executed base-to-final approach turn. There may be an unrecognized tailwind component and higher  groundspeed on the base leg, which causes the pilot to turn late or with inadequate bank. The airplane overshoots the runway  centerline, and the pilot attempts to correct by increasing the bank angle, increasing back elevator pressure, and applying excess  rudder in the direction of the turn (i.e., inside or bottom rudder pressure) to bring the nose around further to align it with the runway.  The difference in lift between the inside and outside wing will increase, resulting in an unwanted increase in bank angle. At the same  time, the nose of the airplane slices downward through the horizon. The natural reaction to this may be for the pilot to pull back on  the elevator control, increasing the AOA toward critical. Should a stall be encountered with these inputs, the airplane may rapidly  enter   a spin.   The safest action   for   an   “overshoot” is   to   perform   a go-around. At the relatively low altitude of a base-to-final approach  turn, a pilot should be reluctant to use bank angles greater than 30 degrees and should not make a skidding turn if correcting for any  overshoot.  

Before performing this stall, the pilot should establish a safe altitude for entry and recovery in the event of a spin, and clear the area  of other traffic while slowly retarding the throttle. The next step is to lower the landing gear (if equipped with retractable gear), close  the throttle, and maintain altitude until the airspeed approaches the normal glide speed. To avoid the possibility of exceeding the  airplane’s   limitations,   the pilot should   not extend   the flaps.   While the gliding   attitude and   airspeed   are being   established,   the airplane  should be retrimmed. Once the glide is stabilized, the airplane should be rolled into a medium-banked turn to simulate a final  approach turn that overshoots the centerline of the runway.  

During the turn, the pilot should smoothly apply excessive rudder pressure in the direction of the turn and hold the bank constant by  applying opposite aileron pressure. At the same time, the pilot increases back elevator pressure to keep the nose from lowering. All of  these control pressures should be increased until the airplane stalls. When the stall occurs, the pilot applies nose-down elevator  pressure to reduce the AOA until the stall warning has been eliminated, removes the excessive rudder input and levels the wings, and  adds power as needed to return to complete the recovery and return to the desired flightpath.  

# Elevator Trim Stall  

The elevator trim stall demonstration shows what can happen when the pilot applies full power for a go-around without maintaining  positive control of the airplane.  [Figure 5-14]  This is a demonstration-only maneuver; only flight instructor applicants may be  required to perform it on a practical test. However, all pilots should be familiar with the situations that can cause an elevator trim  stall, recognize its development, and take appropriate action to prevent it.  

![](images/28ec48d9663e277d2d8e9b36b358b9c731a6de6f83e038f0cc9663649f86fcc9.jpg)  
Figure 5-14.  Elevator trim stall.  

This situation may occur during a go-around procedure from a normal landing approach or a simulated, forced-landing approach, or  immediately after a takeoff, with the trim set for a normal landing approach glide at idle power. The demonstration shows the  importance of making smooth power applications, overcoming strong trim forces, maintaining positive control of the airplane to hold  safe flight attitudes, and   using   proper   and   timely   trim   techniques. It also   develops   the pilot’s   ability   to   avoid   actions   that could result  in this stall, to recognize when an elevator trim stall is approaching, and to take prompt and correct action to prevent a full stall  condition. It is imperative to avoid the occurrence of an elevator trim stall during an actual go-around from an approach to landing.  

At a safe altitude and after ensuring that the area is clear of other air traffic, the pilot should slowly retard the throttle and extend the  landing gear (if the airplane is equipped with retractable gear). The next step is to extend the flaps to the one-half or full position,  close the throttle, and maintain altitude until the airspeed approaches the normal glide speed.  

When the normal glide is established, the pilot should trim the airplane nose-up for the normal landing approach glide. During this  simulated final approach glide, the throttle is then advanced smoothly to maximum allowable power, just as it would be adjusted to  perform a go-around.  

The combined effects of increased propwash over the tail and elevator trim tend to make the nose rise sharply and turn to the left.  With the throttle fully advanced, the pitch attitude increases above the normal climbing attitude. When it is apparent the airplane is  approaching a stall, the pilot should apply sufficient forward elevator pressure to reduce the AOA and eliminate the stall warning  before returning the airplane to the normal climbing attitude. The pilot will need to adjust trim to relieve the heavy control pressures  and then complete the normal go around procedures and return to the desired flightpath. If taken to the full stall, recovery will require  a significant nose-down attitude to reduce the AOA below its critical AOA, along with a corresponding significant loss of altitude.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of intentional stalls are:  

1.  Failure to adequately clear the area.  2. Over-reliance on the airspeed indicator and slip-skid indicator while excluding other cues after recovery.  3. Inadvertent accelerated stall by pulling too fast on the controls during a power-off or power-on stall entry.  4. Inability to recognize an impending stall condition.  5. Failure to take timely action to prevent a full stall during the conduct of impending stalls.  6. Failure to maintain a constant bank angle during turning stalls.  7. Failure to maintain proper coordination with the rudder throughout the stall and recovery.  8. Recovering before reaching the critical AOA when practicing the full stall maneuver.  9. Not disconnecting the wing leveler or autopilot, if equipped, prior to reducing AOA.  10. Recovery is attempted without recognizing the importance of pitch control and AOA.  11. Not maintaining a nose down control input until the stall warning is eliminated.  12. Pilot attempts to level the wings before reducing AOA.  13. Pilot attempts to recover with power before reducing AOA.  14. Failure to roll wings level after AOA reduction and stall warning is eliminated.  15. Inadvertent secondary stall during recovery.  16. Excessive forward-elevator pressure during recovery resulting in low or negative G load.  17. Excessive airspeed buildup during recovery.  18. Losing situational awareness and failing to return to desired flightpath or follow ATC instructions.  

# Spin Awareness  

A spin is an aggravated stall condition that may result after a stall occurs. Mishandling of yaw control during a stall increases the  likelihood of a spin entry. A spin results in the airplane following a downward corkscrew path. During a spin, the airplane rotates  around its vertical axis affected by different lift and drag forces on each wing, and the airplane descends due to gravity, rolling,  yawing, and pitching in a spiral path.  [Figure 5-15]  There are different types of spins. The spin type or types that occur in a particular  airplane may be by airplane design, loading, control inputs, and density altitude. In all spins at least one of the wings is stalled. Refer  to the airplane POH for spin recovery techniques appropriate to the make and model being flown. Techniques in the POH take  precedence over information in this section.  

![](images/bcb9eca31ec1e17fea2e9b683ca2fe64f786d7bb582d1c34524074aa0c094912.jpg)  
Figure 5-15.  Spin—an aggravated stall and autorotation .  

A   spin   occurs   when   at least one of   the airplane’s   wings   exceed   the critical AOA   (stall)   with   a sideslip   or   yaw   acting   on   the airplane at,  or beyond, the actual stall. An airplane will yaw not only because of incorrect rudder application but because of adverse yaw created  by aileron deflection; engine/prop effects, including p-factor, torque, spiraling slipstream, and gyroscopic precession; and wind shear,  including wake turbulence. If the yaw had been created by the pilot because of incorrect  rudder use, the pilot may not be aware that a  critical AOA has been exceeded until the airplane yaws out of control toward the lowering wing. A stall that occurs while the airplane  is in a slipping or skidding turn can result in a spin entry and rotation in the direction of rudder application, regardless of which  wingtip is raised. If the pilot does not immediately initiate stall recovery, the airplane may enter a spin.  

Maintaining directional control and not allowing the nose to yaw before stall recovery is initiated is key to averting a spin. The pilot  should apply the correct amount of rudder to keep the nose from yawing and the wings from banking.  

Modern airplanes tend to be more reluctant to spin compared to older designs, however it is not impossible for them to spin.  Mishandling the controls in turns, stalls, and  uncoordinated slow  flight can put even the most reluctant airplanes into an accidental  spin. Proficiency in avoiding conditions that could lead to an accidental stall/spin situation, and in promptly taking the correct actions  to recover to normal flight, is essential. An airplane needs to be stalled and yawed in order to enter a spin; therefore, continued  practice in stall recognition and recovery helps the pilot develop a more instinctive and prompt reaction in recognizing an  approaching spin. Upon recognition of a spin or approaching spin, the pilot should immediately execute spin recovery procedures.  

# Spin Procedures  

The first rule for spin demonstration is to ensure that the airplane is approved for spins. Please note that this discussion addresses  generic spin procedures; it does not cover special spin procedures or techniques required for a particular airplane. Safety dictates  careful review of the AFM/POH and regulations before attempting spins in any airplane. The review should include the following  items:  

⦁  The airplane’s   AFM/POH limitations   section,   placards,   or   type certification   data to   determine if   the  airplane is approved for spins  ⦁  Weight and balance limitations  ⦁  Recommended entry and recovery procedures  ⦁  The current 14 CFR part 91 parachute requirements  

Also essential is a thorough airplane preflight inspection, with special emphasis on excess or loose items that may affect the weight,  CG, and controllability of the airplane. It is also important to ensure that the airplane is within any CG limitations as determined by  the manufacturer. Slack or loose control cables (particularly rudder and elevator) could prevent full anti-spin control deflections and  delay or preclude recovery in some airplanes.  

Prior to any intentional spin, clear the flight area above and below the airplane for other traffic. This task may occur while slowing the  airplane for the spin entry. In addition, all spins should begin at an altitude high enough to complete recovery at or above 1,500 feet  AGL. Note that the first turn in a spin results in an altitude loss of approximately 1,000 feet, while each subsequent turn loses about  half that amount.  

It may be appropriate to introduce spin training by first practicing both power-on and power-off stalls in a clean configuration. This  practice helps familiarize the pilot with the airplane’s specific stall and recovery characteristics. In all phases of training, the  pilot should take care with handling of the power (throttle), and apply carburetor heat, if equipped, according to the  manufacturer’s recommendations  

There are four phases of a spin: entry, incipient, developed, and recovery.  [Figure 5-16]  

![](images/e2778dfdd2327056888884008d1148d2c773d6e23dbc47964ac753d9f83303a1.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.  Spin Entry and Recovery.  

# Entry Phase  

In the entry phase, the pilot intentionally or accidentally provides the necessary elements for the spin. The entry procedure for  demonstrating a spin is similar to a power-off stall. During the entry, the pilot should slowly reduce power to idle, while  simultaneously raising the nose to a pitch attitude that ensures a stall. As the airplane approaches a stall, the pilot smoothly applies  full rudder in the direction of the desired spin rotation while applying full back (up) elevator to the limit of travel. Unless AFM/POH  specifies otherwise, ailerons are maintained in the neutral position during the spin procedure.  

# Incipient Phase  

The incipient phase occurs from the time the airplane stalls and starts rotating until the spin has fully developed. This phase may take  two to four turns for most airplanes. In this phase, the aerodynamic and inertial forces have not achieved a balance. As the incipient  phase develops, the indicated airspeed will generally stabilize at a low and constant airspeed and the symbolic airplane of the turn  indicator should indicate the direction of the spin. The pilot should not use the slip/skid ball (inclinometer) to determine spin  direction. The location of the instrument in the airplane determines how the ball will move rather than the direction of the spin. For  example, the ball mounted on the left side of the airplane will always move to the left, even in spin with rotation to the right.  

The pilot should initiate incipient spin recovery procedures prior to completing   $360^{\circ}$   of rotation. The pilot should apply full rudder  opposite the direction of rotation. The turn indicator shows a deflection in the direction of rotation if disoriented.  

Incipient spins that are not allowed to develop into a steady-state spin are the most commonly used maneuver in initial spin  training and recovery techniques.  

# Developed Phase  

The developed phase occurs when the airplane’s angular rotation rate, airspeed, and vertical speed are stabilized in a flightpath that is  nearly vertical. In the developed phase, aerodynamic forces and inertial forces are in balance, and the airplane’s attitude, angles, and  self-sustaining motions about the vertical axis are constant or repetitive, or nearly so. The spin is in equilibrium. It is important  to note that some training airplanes will not enter into the developed phase but could transition unexpectedly from the incipient phase  into a spiral dive. In a spiral dive the airplane will not be in equilibrium but instead will be accelerating and G load can  rapidly increase as a result.  

# Recovery Phase  

The recovery phase occurs when rotation ceases and the AOA of the wings is decreased below the critical AOA. This phase may last  for as little as a quarter turn or up to several turns depending upon the airplane and the type of spin. To recover, the pilot applies  control inputs to disrupt the spin equilibrium by stopping the rotation and unstalling the wing. To accomplish spin recovery, the pilot  should always follow the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. In the absence of the manufacturer’s recommended spin recovery  procedures and techniques, use the six-step spin recovery procedure in  Figure 5-17 . If the flaps and/or retractable landing gear are  extended prior to the spin, they should be retracted as soon as practicable after spin entry.  

![](images/b1e423aa4d9c617d592765afb711e414de4e2d39800b1ad5524cdc7137aae7e5.jpg)  
Figure 5-17.  Spin recovery template.  

The following discussion explains each of the six steps a pilot should follow for spin recovery:  

1. Reduce the power (throttle) to idle. Power aggravates spin characteristics. It can result in a flatter spin  attitude and usually increases the rate of rotation.  

2.   Position the ailerons to neutral. Ailerons may have an adverse effect on spin recovery. Aileron control in  the direction of the spin may accelerate the rate of rotation, steepen the spin attitude and delay the recovery.  Aileron control opposite the direction of the spin may cause flattening of the spin attitude and delayed  recovery; or may even be responsible for causing an unrecoverable spin. The best procedure is to ensure  that the ailerons are neutral.  3.   Apply and hold full opposite rudder against the rotation until the rotation stops.  Rudder tends to be the  most important control for recovery in typical single-engine airplanes, and its application should be brisk  and full opposite to the direction of rotation. Avoid slow and overly cautious opposite rudder movement  during spin recovery, which can allow the airplane to spin indefinitely, even with anti-spin inputs. A brisk  and positive technique results in a more positive spin recovery.  4.   Apply positive, brisk, and straight-forward elevator (forward of neutral). This step should be taken  immediately after full rudder application. Do not wait for the rotation to stop before performing this step.  The forceful movement of the elevator decreases the AOA and drives the airplane toward unstalled flight.  In some cases, full forward elevator may be required for recovery. Hold the controls firmly in these  positions until the spinning stops. (Note: If the airspeed is increasing, the airplane is no longer in a spin. In  a spin, the airplane is stalled, and the indicated airspeed should therefore be relatively low and constant and  should not be accelerating.)  5.   Neutralize the rudder after spin rotation stops. Failure to neutralize the rudder at this time, when airspeed is  increasing, causes a yawing or sideslipping effect.  6.   Apply back elevator pressure to return to level flight  and adjust power as appropriate . Be careful not to  apply excessive back elevator pressure after the rotation stops and the rudder has been neutralized.  Excessive back elevator pressure can cause a secondary stall and may result in another spin. Avoid  exceeding the G-load limits and airspeed limitations during the pull out.  

Again, it is important to remember that the spin recovery procedures and techniques described above are recommended for use only  in   the absence   of   the manufacturer’s   procedures. The pilot must always   be familiar   with   the manufacturer’s   procedures for   spin  recovery.  

# Intentional Spins  

If the manufacturer does not specifically approve an aircraft for spins, intentional spins are not authorized by the CFRs or suggested  by this handbook. The official sources for determining whether the spin maneuver is approved are:  

⦁  Type Certificate Data Sheets or the aircraft specifications  ⦁  The limitation section of the FAA-approved AFM/ POH regarding and limiting gross weight, CG      range, or amount of fuel  ⦁  On   a placard   located    clear   view   of   the pilot in   the airplane (e.g.,   “NO ACROBATIC       MANEUVERS INCLUDING SPINS APPROVED”)  

In airplanes placarded against spins, there is no assurance that recovery from a fully-developed spin is possible.  Unfortunately,  accident records show occurrences in which pilots intentionally ignored spin restrictions. Despite the installation of placards  prohibiting intentional spins in these airplanes, some pilots and even some flight instructors attempt to justify the maneuver,  rationalizing   that the spin   restriction   results   from   a “technicality” in   the airworthiness   standards.   They   believe that if   the airplane was  spin tested during its certification process, no problem should result from demonstrating or practicing spins.  

Such pilots overlook the fact that certification of normal category single-engine airplanes that occurred in accordance with 14 CFR  part 23, section 23.221(a) (which still applies to aircraft certified under that regulation) only required the airplane to recover from a  one-turn spin or a three-second spin, whichever takes longer, in not more than one additional turn after initiation of the first control  action for recover, or demonstrate compliance with the optional spin resistant requirements of that section. In other words, many of  these airplanes were never required to recover from a fully developed spin. 14 CFR part 23, section 23.2150 states the current  certification requirements pertaining to spin characteristics for airplanes certified under that regulation going forward. In all airplanes  placarded against spins, there is absolutely no assurance that recovery from a fully developed spin is possible under any  circumstances. The pilot of an airplane placarded against intentional spins should assume that the airplane could become  uncontrollable in a spin.  

# Weight and Balance Requirement Related to Spins  

In airplanes that are approved for spins, compliance with weight and balance requirements is important for safe performance and  recovery   from   the spin   maneuver.   Pilots   should   know   that even   minor   weight or   balance   changes can   affect the airplane’s   spin   recovery characteristics. Such changes can either degrade or enhance the spin maneuver and/or recovery characteristics. For example,  the addition of weight in the aft baggage compartment, or additional fuel, may still permit the airplane to be operated within CG, but  could seriously affect the spin and recovery characteristics. An airplane that may be difficult to spin intentionally in the utility  category (restricted aft CG and reduced weight) could have less resistance to spin entry in the normal category (less restricted aft CG  and   increased   weight).   This   situation   arises from   the airplane’s   ability   to   generate a higher   AOA.   An   airplane that is   approved for  spins in the utility category but loaded in accordance with the normal category may not recover from a spin that is allowed to progress  beyond one turn.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of intentional spins are:  

1. Failure to apply full rudder pressure (to the stops) in the desired spin direction during spin entry  2. Failure to apply and maintain full up-elevator pressure during spin entry, resulting in a spiral  3. Failure to achieve a fully-stalled condition prior to spin entry  4. Failure to apply full rudder (to the stops) briskly against the spin during recovery  5. Failure to apply sufficient forward-elevator during recovery  6. Waiting for rotation to stop before applying forward-elevator  7. Failure to neutralize the rudder after rotation stops, possibly resulting in a secondary spin  8. Slow and overly cautious control movements during recovery  9. Excessive back-elevator pressure after rotation stops, possibly resulting in secondary stall  10. Insufficient back-elevator pressure during recovery resulting in excessive airspeed  

# Spiral Dive  

A spiral dive, a nose-low upset, is a descending turn during which airspeed and G-load can increase rapidly and often results from a  botched turn. In a spiral dive, the airplane is flying very tight circles, in a nearly vertical attitude and will be accelerating because it is  no longer stalled. Pilots typically get into a spiral dive during an inadvertent IMC encounter, most often when the pilot relies on  kinesthetic sensations rather than on the flight instruments. A pilot distracted by other sensations can easily enter a slightly nose-low,  wing-low, descending turn and, at least initially, fail to recognize this error. Especially in IMC, it may be only the sound of increasing  speed that makes the pilot aware of the rapidly developing situation. Upon recognizing the steep nose-down attitude and steep bank,  the startled pilot may react by pulling back rapidly on the yoke while simultaneously rolling to wings-level. This response can create  aerodynamic loads capable of causing airframe structural damage and/or failure.  

The following discussion explains each of the five steps a pilot should use to recover from a spiral dive:  

1.  

2.   Apply some forward-elevator. Prior to rolling the wings level, it is important to unload the G-load on the  airplane (“unload the wing”). This is accomplished by applying some forward-elevator pressure to return to  about  $+1\mathrm{G}$  . Apply just enough forward-elevator to ensure that you are not aggravating the spiral with aft- elevator. While generally a small input, this push has several benefits prior to rolling the wings level in the  next step –   the push reduces the AOA, reduces the G-load, and slows the turn rate while increasing the turn  radius, and preventing a rolling pullout. The design limit of the airplane is exceeded more easily during a  rolling pullout, so failure to reduce the G-load prior to rolling the wings level could result in structural  damage or failure.  3.   Roll to wings level using coordinated aileron and rudder inputs. Even though the airplane is in a nose-low  attitude, continue the roll until the wings are completely level again before performing step four.  4.   Gently raise the nose to level flight. It is possible that the airplane in a spiral dive might be at or even  beyond  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$    (never exceed speed) speed. Therefore, control inputs are made slowly and gently at this point  to prevent structural failure. Raise the nose to a climb attitude only after speed decreases to safe levels.  5.   Increase power to climb power. Once the airspeed has stabilized to   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , apply climb power and climb back  to a safe altitude.  

In general, spiral dive recovery procedures are summarized in  Figure 5-18.  

![Figure 5-18.  Spiral dive recovery template.  ](images/921876ca578edc9f4037662604bb079595b5e631a76ce8aee2f4999a635dc3c7.jpg)  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the recovery from spiral dives are:  

1.  Failure to reduce power first  2.  Mistakenly adding power  3.  Attempting to pull out of dive without rolling wings level  4.  Simultaneously pulling out of dive while rolling wings level  5.  Not unloading the Gs prior to rolling level  6.  Not adding power once climb is established  

# UPRT Summary  

A significant point to note is that UPRT skills are both complex and perishable. Repetition is needed to establish the correct mental  models, and recurrent practice/training is necessary as well. The context in which UPRT procedures are introduced and implemented  is also an important consideration. The pilot should clearly understand, for example, whether a particular procedure has broad  applicability, or is type-specific. To attain the highest levels of learning possible, the best approach starts with the broadest form of a  given procedure, then narrows it down to type-specific requirements.  

# Chapter Summary  

A   pilot’s   most fundamental and   important responsibility    to   maintain   aircraft control. Initial flight training   thus   provides skills to  operate an   airplane in   a safe manner,   generally   within   normal “expected” environments,   with   the addition   of   some instruction   in upset  and stall situations.  

This chapter discussed the elements of basic airplane control, with emphasis on AOA. It offered a discussion of circumstances and  scenarios that can lead to LOC-I, including stalls and airplane upsets. It discussed the importance of developing proficiency in slow  flight, stalls, and stall recoveries, spin awareness and recovery, upset prevention and recovery, and spiral dive recovery.  

Pilots need to understand that primary training cannot cover all possible contingencies that an airplane or pilot may encounter. They  should seek recurrent/additional training for their normal areas of operation and seek appropriate training that develops their  aeronautical skill set beyond the requirements for initial certification.  

For additional considerations on performing some of these maneuvers in multiengine airplanes and turbojet-powered airplanes, refer  to Chapters 12 and 15, respectively.

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 6: Takeoffs and Departure Climbs  

# Introduction  

About twenty percent of all yearly general aviation (GA) accidents occur during takeoff and departure climbs, and more than half of  those accidents are the result of some sort of failure of the pilot. A significant number of takeoff accidents are the result of loss of  control of the airplane. When compared to the entire profile of a normal flight, this phase of a flight is relatively short, but the pilot  workload is intense. This chapter discusses takeoffs and departure climbs in airplanes under normal conditions and under conditions  that require maximum performance.  

Though it may seem relatively simple, the takeoff often presents the most hazards of any part of a flight. The importance of thorough  knowledge of procedures and techniques coupled with proficiency in performance cannot be overemphasized.  

The discussion in this chapter is centered on airplanes with tricycle landing gear (nose-wheel). Procedures for conventional gear  airplanes (tail-wheel)   are discussed   in   Chapter   14: Transition   to   Tailwheel Airplanes. The manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures  pertaining to airplane configuration, airspeeds, and other information relevant to takeoffs and departure climbs in a specific make and  model airplane are contained in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved   Airplane Flight Manual and/or   Pilot’s   Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) for that airplane. If any of the information in this chapter differs from the airplane manufacturer’s   recommendations   as contained    the AFM/POH,   the airplane manufacturer’s   recommendations   take precedence.  

# Terms and Definitions  

Although the takeoff and climb is one continuous maneuver, it will be divided into three separate steps for purposes of explanation:  1.) takeoff roll; 2.) lift-off; and 3.) initial climb after becoming airborne. Refer to  Figure 6-1  and the detail below.  

⦁  Takeoff roll (ground roll) is the portion of the takeoff procedure during which the airplane is accelerated      from a standstill to an airspeed that provides sufficient lift for it to become airborne.  

⦁  Lift-off is when the wings are lifting the weight of the airplane off the surface. In most airplanes, this is the      result of the pilot rotating the nose up to increase the angle of attack (AOA).  

⦁  The initial climb begins when the airplane leaves the surface and a climb pitch attitude has been established.      Normally, it is considered complete when the airplane has reached a safe maneuvering altitude or an en      route climb has been established.  

# Prior to Takeoff  

Before going to the airplane, the pilot should check the POH/AFM performance charts to determine the predicted performance and  decide if the airplane is capable of a safe takeoff and climb for the conditions and location.  [Figure 6-2]  High density altitudes reduce  engine and propeller performance, increase takeoff rolls, and decrease climb performance. A more detailed discussion of density  altitude and how it affects airplane performance can be found in the  Pilot’s   Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge   (FAA-H-8083-25,  as revised).  

All run-up and pre-takeoff checklist items should be completed before taxiing onto the runway or takeoff area. As a minimum before  every takeoff, all engine instruments should be checked for proper and usual indications, and all controls should be checked for full,  free, and correct moveme nt.  The pilot should also consider available options if an engine failure occurs after takeoff. These options  include the preferred direction for any emergency turns to landing sites based on the departure path, altitude, wind conditions, and  terrain.  In addition, the pilot should make certain that the approach and takeoff paths are clear of other aircraft. At nontowered  airports, pilots should announce their intentions on the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) assigned to that airport. When  operating from a towered airport, pilots need to contact the tower operator and receive a takeoff clearan ce before taxiing onto the  active runway.  

Taking off immediately behind another aircraft, particularly a large and heavy transport airplane, creates the risk of a wake turbulence  encounter, and a possible loss of control. However, if an immediate takeoff behind a large heavy aircraft is necessary, the pilot should  plan   to   minimize the chances   of   flying   through   an   aircraft’s   wake turbulence   by   avoiding   the other   aircraft’s   flightpath   or   rotating  prior to the point at which the preceding aircraft rotated. While taxiing onto the runway, the pilot should select ground reference  points that are aligned with the runway direction to aid in maintaining directional control and alignment with the runway center line  during the climb out. These may be runway centerline markings, runway lighting, distant trees, towers, buildings, or mountain peaks.

# Normal Takeoff  

A normal takeoff is one in which the airplane is  headed into the wind; there are times that a takeoff with a tail wind is necessary.  However, the pilot should consult the POH/AFM to ensure the aircraft is approved for a takeoff with a tail wind and that there is  sufficient performance and runway length for the takeoff.  The pilot should also ensure that the takeoff surfaces are  firm and of  sufficient length to permit the airplane to gradually accelerate to normal lift-off and climb-out speed, and there are no obstructions  along the takeoff path.  

There are two reasons for making a takeoff as nearly into the wind as possible. First, since the airplane depends on airspeed, a  headwind provides some of that airspeed even before the airplane begins to accelerate into the wind. Second, a headwind decreases  the ground speed necessary to achieve flying speed. Slower ground speeds yield shorter ground roll distances and allow use of shorter  runways while reducing wear and stress on the landing gear.  

# Takeoff Roll  

For   takeoff,   the pilot uses the rudder   pedals in   most general aviation   airplanes to   steer   the airplane’s   nose-wheel onto the runway  centerline to align the airplane and nose-wheel with the runway. After releasing the brakes, the pilot should advance the throttle  smoothly and continuously to takeoff power. An abrupt application of power may cause the airplane to yaw sharply to the left because  of the torque effects of the engine and propeller. This is most apparent in high horsepower engines. As the airplane starts to roll  forward, assure both feet are on the rudder pedals so that the toes or balls of the feet are on the rudder portions, not on the brake.  Check the engine instruments for indications of a malfunction during the takeoff roll.  

In nose-wheel type airplanes, pressures on the elevator control are not necessary beyond those needed to steady it. Applying  unnecessary pressure only aggravates the takeoff and prevents the pilot from recognizing when elevator control pressure is actually  needed to establish the takeoff attitude.  

As the airplane gains speed, the elevator control tends to assume a neutral position if the airplane is correctly trimmed. At the same  time, the rudder pedals are used to keep the nose of the airplane pointed down the runway and parallel to the centerline. The effects of  engine torque and P-factor at the initial speeds tend to pull the nose to the left. The pilot should use whatever rudder pressure is  needed to correct for these effects or winds. The pilot should use aileron controls into any crosswind to keep the airplane centered on  the runway centerline. The pilot should avoid using the brakes for steering purposes as this will slow acceleration, lengthen the  takeoff distance, and possibly result in severe swerving.  

As the speed of the takeoff roll increases, more and more pressure will be felt on the flight controls, particularly the elevators and  rudder. If the tail surfaces are affected by the propeller slipstream, they become effective first. As the speed continues to increase, all  of the flight controls will gradually become effective enough to maneuver the airplane about its three axes. At this point, the airplane  is being flown more than it is being taxied. As this occurs, progressively smaller rudder deflections are needed to maintain direction.  

The feel of   resistance   to   the movement of   the controls   and   the airplane’s   reaction   to   such   movements   are the only   real indicators of  the degree   of   control attained.   This   feel of   resistance    not a measure of   the airplane’s   speed,   but rather   of   its   controllability. To  determine the degree of controllability, the pilot should be conscious of the reaction of the airplane to the control pressures and  immediately adjust the pressures as needed to control the airplane. The pilot should wait for the reaction of the airplane to the applied  control pressures and attempt to sense the control resistance to pressure rather than attempt to control the airplane by movement of the  controls.  

A student pilot does not normally have a full appreciation of the variations of control pressures with the speed of the airplane. The  student may tend to move the controls through wide ranges seeking the pressures that are familiar and expected and, as a  consequence, over-control the airplane.  

The situation may be aggravated by the sluggish reaction of the airplane to these movements. The flight instructor should help the  student learn proper response to control actions and airplane reactions. The instructor should always stress using the proper outside  reference to judge airplane motion. For takeoff, the student should always be looking far down the runway at two points aligned with  the runway. The flight instructor should have the student pilot follow through lightly on the controls, feel for resistance, and point out  the outside references that provide the clues for how much control movement is needed and how the pressure and response changes as  airspeed   increases. With   practice,   the student pilot should   become familiar   with   the airplane’s   response to   acceleration   up   to lift-off  speed, corrective control movements needed, and the outside references necessary to accomplish the takeoff maneuver.  

# Lift-Off  

Since a good takeoff depends on the proper takeoff attitude, it is important to know how this attitude appears and how it is attained.  The ideal takeoff attitude requires only minimum pitch adjustments shortly after the airplane lifts off to attain the speed for the best  rate of climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  .  [Figure   $_{6-3J}$    The pitch attitude necessary for the airplane to accelerate to   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    speed should be demonstrated by the  instructor and memorized by the student. Flight instructors should be aware that initially, the student pilot may have a tendency to  hold excessive back-elevator pressure just after lift-off, resulting in an abrupt pitch-up.  

![](images/e45360eed76f05af2c137db0333a57f640927ba5f04fe45f35d2618d7c629b4a.jpg)  
Figure 6-3.  Initial roll and takeoff attitude.  

Each type of airplane has a best pitch attitude for normal lift-off; however, varying conditions may make a difference in the required  takeoff technique. A rough field, a smooth field, a hard surface runway, or a short or soft, muddy field all call for a slightly different  technique, as will smooth air in contrast to a strong, gusty wind. The different techniques for those other-than-normal conditions are  discussed later in this chapter.  

When all the flight controls become effective during the takeoff roll in a nose-wheel type airplane, the pilot should gradually apply  back-elevator pressure to raise the nose-wheel slightly off the runway, thus establishing the takeoff or lift-off attitude. This is the  “rotation” for   lift-off and climb. As the airplane lifts off the surface, the pitch attitude to hold the climb airspeed should be held with  elevator control and trimmed to maintain that pitch attitude without excessive control pressures. The wings should be leveled after  lift-off and the rudder used to ensure coordinated flight.  

After rotation, the slightly nose-high pitch attitude should be held until the airplane lifts off. Rudder control should be used to  maintain the track of the airplane along the runway centerline until any required crab angle in level flight is established. Forcing it  into the air by applying excessive back-elevator pressure would only result in an excessively high-pitch attitude and may delay the  takeoff. As discussed earlier, excessive and rapid changes in pitch attitude result in proportionate changes in the effects of torque,  thus making the airplane more difficult to control.  

Although the airplane can be forced into the air, this is considered an unsafe practice and should be avoided under normal  circumstances. If the airplane is forced to leave the ground by using too much back-elevator pressure before adequate flying speed is  attained,   the wing’s   AOA   may   become excessive,   causing   the airplane to   settle back    the runway   or   even    stall. On   the other hand,  if sufficient back-elevator pressure is not held to maintain the correct takeoff attitude after becoming airborne, or the nose is allowed  to lower excessively, the airplane may also settle back to the runway. This would occur because the AOA is decreased and lift  diminished to the degree where it will not support the airplane. It is important, then, to hold the correct attitude constant after rotation  or lift-off.  

As the airplane leaves the ground, the pilot should keep the wings in a level attitude and hold the proper pitch attitude. Outside visual  scans should be intensified at this critical point to attain/maintain proper airplane pitch and bank attitude. Due to the minimum  airspeed, the flight controls are not as responsive, requiring more control movement to achieve an expected response. A novice pilot  often   has   a tendency   to   fixate   on   the   airplane’s   pitch   attitude   and/or   the   airspeed   indicator   and   neglect bank   control of   the   airplane.  Torque from the engine tends to impart a rolling force that is most evident as the landing gear is leaving the surface.  

During takeoffs in a strong, gusty wind, it is advisable that an extra margin of speed be obtained before the airplane is allowed to  leave the ground. A takeoff at the normal takeoff speed may result in a lack of positive control, or a stall, when the airplane  encounters a sudden lull in strong, gusty wind, or other turbulent air currents. In this case, the pilot should allow the airplane to stay  on the ground longer to attain more speed, then make a smooth, positive rotation to leave the ground.  

# Initial Climb  

Upon liftoff, the airplane should be flying at approximately the pitch attitude that allows it to accelerate to   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  . This is the speed at  which the airplane gains the most altitude in the shortest period of time.  

If the airplane has been properly trimmed for takeoff, some back-elevator pressure may be required to hold this attitude until the  proper climb speed is established. Relaxation of any back-elevator pressure before this time may result in the airplane settling, even to  the extent that it contacts the runway.  

The   airplane’s   speed   will   increase   rapidly   after   it becomes   airborne.   Once   a positive   rate   of   climb    established,   the   pilot   should  retract the flaps and landing gear (if equipped). It is recommended that takeoff power be maintained until reaching an altitude of at  least 500 feet above the surrounding terrain or obstacles. The combination of   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    and takeoff power assures the maximum altitude  gained in a minimum amount of time. This gives the pilot more altitude from which the airplane can be safely maneuvered in case of  an engine failure or other emerg ency.  The pilot should also consider flying at a lower pitch for cruise climb since flying at   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  requires much quicker pilot response in the event of a powerplant failure to preclude a stall.  

Since the power on the initial climb is set at the takeoff power setting, the airspeed should be controlled by making slight pitch  adjustments using the elevators. However, the pilot should not fixate on the airspeed indicator when making these pitch changes, but  should   continue to   scan   outside to   adjust the airplane’s   attitude in   relation    the horizon.   In   accordance   with   the principles of attitude  flying, the pilot should first make the necessary pitch change with reference to the natural horizon, hold the new attitude momentarily,  and then glance at the airspeed indicator to verify if the new attitude is correct. Due to inertia, the airplane will not accelerate or  decelerate immediately as the pitch is changed. It takes a little time for the airspeed to change. If the pitch attitude has been over or  under corrected, the airspeed indicator will show a speed that is higher or lower than that desired. When this occurs, the cross­ checking and appropriate pitch-changing process needs to be repeated until the desired climbing attitude is established. Pilots should  remember the climb pitch will be lower when the airplane is heavily loaded, or power is limited by density altitude.  

When the correct pitch attitude has been attained, the pilot should hold it constant while cross-checking it against the horizon and  other outside visual references. The airspeed indicator should be used only as a check to determine if the attitude is correct.  

After the recommended climb airspeed has been established and a safe maneuvering altitude has been reached, the pilot should adjust  the power to the recommended climb setting and trim the airplane to relieve the control pressures. This makes it easier to hold a  constant attitude and airspeed.  

During initial climb, it is important that the takeoff path remain aligned with the runway to avoid drifting into obstructions or into the  path of another aircraft that may be taking off from a parallel runway. A flight instructor should help the student identify two points  inline ahead of the runway to use as a tracking reference. As long as those two points are inline, the airplane is remaining on the  desired track. Proper scanning techniques are essential to a safe takeoff and climb, not only for maintaining attitude and direction, but  also for avoiding collisions near the airport.  

When   the student pilot nears   the solo   stage of   flight training,   it should   be explained   that the airplane’s   takeoff   performance will be  much different when the instructor is not in the airplane. Due to decreased load, the airplane will become airborne earlier and climb  more rapidly. The pitch attitude that the student has learned to associate with initial climb may also differ due to decreased weight,  and the flight controls may seem more sensitive. If the situation is unexpected, it may result in increased anxiety that may remain until  after   the landing.   Frequently,   the existence   of   this   anxiety   and   the uncertainty   that develops   due to   the perception   of   an   “abnormal”  takeoff results in poor performance on the subsequent landing.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of normal takeoffs and departure climbs are:  

⦁  Failure to review AFM/POH and performance charts prior to takeoff.  ⦁  Failure to adequately clear the area prior to taxiing into position on the active runway.  ⦁  Abrupt use of the throttle.  ⦁  Failure to check engine instruments for signs of malfunction after applying takeoff power.  ⦁  Failure to anticipate the airplane’s left turning tendency on initial acceleration.   ⦁  Overcorrecting for left turning tendency.  ⦁  Relying solely on the airspeed indicator rather than developing an understanding of visual references and       tracking clues of airplane airspeed and controllability during acceleration and lift-off.                  ⦁  Failure to attain proper lift-off attitude.  ⦁  Inadequate compensation for torque/P-factor during initial climb resulting in a sideslip.  ⦁  Over - control of elevators during initial climb-out and lack of elevator trimming.  ⦁  Limiting scan to areas directly ahead of the airplane (pitch attitude and direction), causing a wing       (usually the left) to drop immediately after lift-off.  ⦁  Failure to attain/maintain best rate-of-climb airspeed   $\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   or desired climb airspeed.  ⦁  Failure to employ the principles of attitude flying during climb-out, resulting in “chasing” the airspeed  indicator.  

# Crosswind Takeoff  

While it is usually preferable to take off directly into the wind whenever possible or practical, there are many instances when  circumstances or judgment indicate otherwise. Therefore, the pilot must be familiar with the principles and techniques involved in  crosswind takeoffs, as well as those for normal takeoffs. A crosswind affects the airplane during takeoff much as it does during  taxiing. With this in mind, the pilot should be aware that the technique used for crosswind correction during takeoffs closely parallels  the crosswind correction techniques used for taxiing.  

# Takeoff Roll  

The technique used during the initial takeoff roll in a crosswind is generally the same as the technique used in a normal takeoff roll,  except that the pilot needs to apply aileron pressure into the crosswind. This raises the aileron on the upwind wing, imposes a  downward force on that wing to counteract the lifting force of the crosswind, and thus prevents the wing from rising. The pilot should  remember that since the ailerons and rudder are deflected, drag will increase; therefore, less initial takeoff performance should be  expected until the airplane is wings-level in coordinated flight in the climb.  

While taxiing into takeoff position, it is essential that the pilot check the windsock and other wind direction indicators for the  presence of a crosswind. If a crosswind is present, the pilot should apply full aileron pressure into the wind while beginning the  takeoff roll. The pilot should maintain this control position, as the airplane accelerates, and until the ailerons become effective in  maneuvering the airplane about its longitudinal axis. As the ailerons become effective, the pilot will feel an increase in pressure on  the aileron control.  

While holding aileron pressure into the wind, the pilot should use the rudder to maintain a straight takeoff path.  [Figure 6-4]  Since  the airplane tends to weathervane into the wind while on the ground, the pilot will typically apply downwind rudder pressure. When  the pilot increases power for takeoff, the resulting P-factor causes the airplane to yaw to the left. While this yaw may be sufficient to  counteract the airplane’s   tendency   to   weathervane into   the wind   in   a crosswind   from   the right, it may   aggravate this   tendency   in a  crosswind from the left. In any case, the pilot should apply rudder pressure in the appropriate direction to keep the airplane rolling  straight down the runway.  

![](images/69a903fdad82aeec90eb97581e75ec619b33c1528d447c9faf78c82e78d665c5.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.  Crosswind roll and takeoff climb.  

As the forward speed of the airplane increases, the pilot should apply sufficient aileron pressure into the crosswind to keep the wings  level. The effect of the crosswind component will not completely vanish; therefore, the pilot needs to maintain some aileron pressure  throughout the takeoff roll. If the upwind wing rises, the amount of wing surface exposed to the crosswind will increase, which may  cause the airplane to lose lateral alignment with the runway centerline and to "skip."  [Figure 6-5]  The pilot uses rudder pressure to  keep   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis   parallel to   the runway   centerline.  

This   “skipping” is   usually   indicated   by   a series of   very   small bounces   caused   by   the airplane attempting   to   fly   and   then   settling back  onto the runway. During these bounces, the crosswind also tends to move the airplane sideways, and these bounces develop into side- skipping. This side-skipping imposes severe side stresses on the landing gear and may result in structural failure.  

During a crosswind takeoff roll, it is important that the pilot hold sufficient aileron pressure into the wind not only to keep the upwind  wing from rising but to hold that wing down so that the airplane sideslips into the wind enough to counteract drift immediately after  lift-off.  

# Lift-Off  

As the nose-wheel raises off of the runway, the pilot should hold aileron pressure into the wind. This may cause the downwind wing  to rise and the downwind main wheel to lift off the runway first, with the remainder of the takeoff roll being made on that one main  wheel. This is acceptable and is preferable to side-skipping.  

If a significant crosswind exists, the pilot should hold the main wheels on the ground slightly longer than in a normal takeoff so that a  smooth but very definite lift-off can be made. This allows the airplane to leave the ground under more positive control and helps it  remain airborne while the pilot establishes the proper amount of wind correction. More importantly, this procedure avoids imposing  excessive side-loads on the landing gear and prevents possible damage that would result from the airplane settling back to the runway  while drifting.  

As both main wheels leave the runway, the airplane begins to drift sideways with the wind, as ground friction is no longer a factor in  preventing lateral movement. To minimize this lateral movement and to keep the upwind wing from rising, the pilot should establish  and maintain the proper amount of crosswind correction prior to lift-off by applying aileron pressure into the wind. The pilot should  also apply rudder pressure, as needed, to prevent weathervaning.

Figure 6-5.  Crosswind effect.  

# Initial Climb  

If a proper crosswind correction is applied, the aircraft will maintain alignment with the runway while accelerating to takeoff speed  and then maintain that alignment once airborne. As takeoff acceleration occurs, the efficiency of the up-aileron will increase with  aircraft speed causing the upwind wing to produce greater downward force and, as a result, counteract the effect of the crosswind.  The yoke, having been initially turned into the wind, can be relaxed to the extent necessary to keep the aircraft aligned with the  runway. As the aircraft becomes flyable and airborne, the wing that is upwind will have a tendency to be lower relative the other  wing, requiring simultaneous rudder input to maintain runway alignment. This will initially cause the aircraft to sideslip. However, as  the aircraft establishes its climb, the nose should be turned into the wind to offset the crosswind, wings brought to level, and rudder  input adjusted to maintain runway alignment (crabbing).  [Figure 6-6]  Firm and positive use of the rudder may be required to keep the  airplane pointed down the runway or parallel to the centerline. Unlike landing, the runway alignment (staying over the runway and its  extended centerline) is paramount to keeping the aircraft parallel to the centerline. The pilot should then apply rudder pressure firmly  and aggressively to keep the airplane headed straight down the runway. However, because the force of a crosswind may vary  markedly within a few hundred feet of the ground, the pilot should check the ground track frequently and adjust the wind correction  angle, as necessary. The remainder of the climb technique is the same used for normal takeoffs and climbs.

Figure 6-6.  Crosswind climb flightpath.  

The most common errors made while performing crosswind takeoffs include the following:  

⦁  Failure to review AFM/POH performance and charts prior to takeoff.  ⦁  Failure to adequately clear the area prior to taxiing onto the active runway.  ⦁  Using less than full aileron pressure into the wind initially on the takeoff roll.  ⦁  Mechanical use of aileron control rather than judging lateral position of airplane on runway from      visual clues and applying sufficient aileron to keep airplane centered laterally on runway.  ⦁  Side-skipping due to improper aileron application.  ⦁  Inadequate rudder control to maintain airplane parallel to centerline and pointed straight ahead in      alignment with visual references.  ⦁  Excessive aileron input in the latter stage of the takeoff roll resulting in a steep bank into the wind at      lift-off.  ⦁  Inadequate drift correction after lift-off.  

# Ground Effect on Takeoff  

Ground effect is a condition of improved performance encountered when the airplane is operating very close to the ground. Ground  effect can be detected and normally occurs up to an altitude equal to one wingspan above the surface.  [Figure 6-7]  Ground effect is  most significant when the airplane maintains a constant attitude at low airspeed at low altitude (for example, during takeoff when the  airplane lifts off and accelerates to climb speed, and during the landing flare before touchdown).  

![](images/eeb1c6b285fceb9091ec6eabc8a80c277dcb9bef7fba47da80769b242daa0bd3.jpg)  
Figure 6-7.  Takeoff in ground effect area.  

When the wing is under the influence of ground effect, there is a reduction in upwash, downwash, and wingtip vortices. As a result of  the reduced wingtip vortices, induced drag is reduced. When the wing is at a height equal to 1/4 the span, the reduction in induced  drag is about 25 percent. When the wing is at a height equal to 1/10 the span, the reduction in induced drag is about 50 percent. At  high speeds where parasite drag dominates, induced drag is a small part of the total drag. Consequently, ground effect is a greater  concern during takeoff and landing.  

At takeoff, the takeoff roll, lift-off, and the beginning of the initial climb are accomplished within the ground effect area. The ground  effect causes local increases in static pressure, which cause the airspeed indicator and altimeter to indicate slightly lower values than  they should and usually cause the vertical speed indicator to indicate a descent. As the airplane lifts off and climbs out of the ground  effect area, the following occurs:  

⦁  The airplane requires an increase in AOA to maintain lift coefficient.   $\circ$    The airplane experiences an increase in induced drag and thrust required.  ⦁  The airplane experiences a pitch-up tendency and requires less elevator travel because of an increase       in downwash at the horizontal tail.  ⦁  The airplane experiences a reduction in static source pressure and a corresponding increase in      indicated airspeed.  

$\mathrm{V_{X}}$    is the speed at which the airplane achieves the greatest gain in altitude for a given distance over the ground. It is usually slightly  less than  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , which is the greatest gain in altitude per unit of time. The specific speeds to be used for a given airplane are stated in the  FAA-approved AFM/POH. The pilot should be aware that, in some airplanes, a deviation of 5 knots from the recommended speed  may result in a significant reduction in climb performance; therefore, the pilot should maintain precise control of the airspeed to  ensure the maneuver is executed safely and successfully.  

Due to the reduced drag in ground effect, the airplane may seem to be able to take off below the recommended airspeed. However, as  the airplane climbs out of ground effect below the recommended climb speed, initial climb performance will be much less than at   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    or even   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  . Under conditions of high density altitude, high temperature, and/or maximum gross weight, the airplane may be able to  lift off but will be unable to climb out of ground effect. Consequently, the airplane may not be able to clear obstructions. Lift-off  before attaining recommended flight airspeed incurs more drag, which requires more power to overcome. Since the initial takeoff and  climb is based on maximum power, reducing drag is the only option. To reduce drag, pitch should be reduced which means losing  altitude. Pilots should remember that many airplanes cannot safely takeoff at maximum gross weight at certain altitudes and  temperatures, due to lack of performance. Therefore, under marginal conditions, it is important that the airplane takes off at the speed  recommended for adequate initial climb performance.  

Ground effect is important to normal flight operations. If the runway is long enough or if no obstacles exist, ground effect can be used  to the pilot’s advantage by using the reduced drag to improve initial acceleration.  

When taking off from an unsatisfactory surface, the pilot should apply as much weight to the wings as possible during the ground run  and lift-off, using ground effect as an aid, prior to attaining true flying speed. The pilot should reduce AOA to attain normal airspeed  before attempting to fly out of the ground effect areas.  

# Short-Field Takeoff and Maximum Performance Climb  

When performing takeoffs and climbs from fields where the takeoff area is short or the available takeoff area is restricted by  obstructions, the pilot should operate the airplane at the maximum limit of its takeoff performance capabilities. To depart from such  an area safely, the pilot needs to exercise positive and precise control of airplane attitude and airspeed, so that takeoff and climb  performance result in the shortest ground roll and the steepest angle of climb.  [Figure 6-8]  The pilot should consult and follow the  performance section of the AFM/POH to obtain the power setting, flap setting, airspeed, and procedures prescribed by the airplane’s   manufacturer.  

![](images/5b337cc55c9bc7c643bc3113cf0acacaab7afdaa35a1d57ed122f0c6a79783e0.jpg)  
Figure 6-8.  Short-field takeoff.  

The pilot should have adequate knowledge in the use and effectiveness of the best angle-of-climb speed   $\left(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$   and the best rate-of­ climb speed   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   for the specific make and model of airplane being flown in order to safely accomplish a takeoff at maximum  performance.  

# Takeoff Roll  

Taking off from a short field requires the takeoff to be started from the very beginning of the takeoff area. At this point, the airplane is  aligned with the intended takeoff path. If the airplane manufacturer recommends the use of flaps, they are extended the proper amount  before beginning   the takeoff   roll. This   allows   the pilot to   devote full attention   to   the proper   technique and   the airplane’s   performance  throughout the takeoff.  

The pilot should apply takeoff power smoothly and continuously, without hesitation, to accelerate the airplane as rapidly as possible.  Some pilots prefer to hold the brakes until the maximum obtainable engine revolutions per minute (rpm) are achieved before allowing  the airplane to begin its takeoff run. However, it has not been established that this procedure results in a shorter takeoff run in all  light, single-engine airplanes. The airplane is allowed to roll with its full weight on the main wheels and accelerate to the lift-off  speed.   As   the   takeoff   roll   progresses,   the   pilot   should   adjust   the   airplane’s   pitch   attitude   and   AOA   to   attain   minimum   drag   and  maximum acceleration. In nose-wheel type airplanes, this involves little use of the elevator control since the airplane is already in a  low-drag attitude.  

# Lift-Off  

As   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    approaches, the pilot should apply back-elevator pressure until reaching the appropriate   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    attitude to ensure a smooth and  firm lift-off, or rotation. Since the airplane accelerates more rapidly after lift-off, the pilot should apply additional back- elevator pressure to hold a constant airspeed. After becoming airborne, the pilot will maintain a wings-level climb at   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    until all  obstacles have been cleared, or if no obstacles are present, until reaching an altitude of at least 50 feet above the takeoff surface.  Thereafter, the pilot may lower the pitch attitude slightly and continue the climb at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    until reaching a safe maneuvering altitude. The  pilot should always remember that an attempt to pull the airplane off the ground prematurely, or to climb too steeply, may cause  the airplane to settle back to the runway or make contact with obstacles. Even if the airplane remains airborne, until the pilot reaches 

  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  , the initial climb will remain flat, which diminishes the pilot's ability to successfully perform the climb and/or clear obstacles. 

 [Figure 6-9]  

![](images/7c568b3a90c56384a3bce3fde22c39b62183eb4c606acec03d7dd9f4be0cca39.jpg)  
Figure 6-9.  Effect of premature lift-off.  

The objective is to rotate to the appropriate pitch attitude at (or near)   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  . The pilot should be aware that some airplanes have a  natural tendency to lift off well before reaching   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  . In these airplanes, it may be necessary to allow the airplane to lift off in ground  effect and then reduce pitch attitude to level until the airplane accelerates to  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    with the wheels just clear of the runway surface. This  method is preferable to forcing the airplane to remain on the ground with forward elevator-control pressure until   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    is attained.  Holding the airplane on the ground unnecessarily puts excessive pressure on the nose-wheel and   may   result in   “wheel barrowing.” It  also hinders both acceleration and overall airplane performance.  

# Initial Climb  

On short-field takeoffs, the landing gear and flaps should remain in takeoff position until the airplane is clear of obstacles (or  as recommended by the manufacturer) and   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    has been established. Until all obstacles have been cleared, the pilot should  maintain focus outside the airplane instead of reaching for landing gear or flap controls or looking inside the airplane for any reason.  When the airplane is stabilized at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , the landing gear (if retractable) and flaps should be retracted. It is usually advisable to raise the  flaps in increments to avoid sudden loss of lift and settling of the airplane. The pilot should next reduce the power to the normal climb  setting or as recommended by the airplane manufacturer.  

Common errors in the performance of short-field takeoffs and maximum performance climbs are:  

⦁  Failure to review AFM/POH and performance charts prior to takeoff.  ⦁  Failure to adequately clear the area.  ⦁  Failure to utilize all available runway/takeoff area.  ⦁  Failure to have the airplane properly trimmed prior to takeoff.  ⦁  Premature lift-off resulting in high drag.  ⦁  Holding the airplane on the ground unnecessarily with excessive forward-elevator pressure.  ⦁  Inadequate rotation resulting in excessive speed after lift-off.  ⦁  Inability to attain/maintain  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  .  ⦁  Fixation on the airspeed indicator during initial climb.  ⦁  Premature retraction of landing gear and/or wing flaps.  

# Soft/Rough-Field Takeoff and Climb  

Takeoffs and climbs from soft fields require the use of operational techniques for getting the airplane airborne as quickly as possible  to eliminate the drag caused by tall grass, soft sand, mud, and snow and may require climbing over an obstacle. The technique makes  judicious   use of   ground   effect to   reduce   landing   gear   drag   and   requires an   understanding   of   the airplane’s   slow   speed   characteristics  and responses. These same techniques are also useful on a rough field where the pilot should get the airplane off the ground as soon  as possible to avoid damaging the landing gear.  

Taking   off   from   a soft surface or   through   soft surfaces or   long,   wet grass   reduces   the airplane’s   ability    accelerate during the takeoff  roll and may prevent the airplane from reaching adequate takeoff speed if the pilot applies normal takeoff techniques. The pilot  should be aware that the correct takeoff procedure for soft fields is quite different from the takeoff procedures used for short fields  with firm, smooth surfaces. To minimize the hazards associated with takeoffs from soft or rough fields, the pilot should transfer the  support   of   the   airplane’s   weight   as rapidly   as possible from   the wheels   to   the wings   as the takeoff   roll proceeds   by   establishing and  maintaining a relatively high AOA or nose-high pitch attitude as early as possible. The pilot should lower the wing flaps prior to  starting   the   takeoff   (if   recommended   by   the   manufacturer)   to   provide   additional   lift   and   to   transfer   the   airplane’s   weight   from the  wheels to the wings as early as possible. The pilot should maintain a continuous motion with sufficient power while lining up for the  takeoff roll as stopping on a soft surface, such as mud or snow, might bog the airplane down.  

# Takeoff Roll  

As the airplane is aligned with the takeoff path, the pilot should apply takeoff power smoothly and as rapidly as the powerplant can  accept without faltering. As the airplane accelerates, the pilot should apply enough back-elevator pressure to establish a positive AOA  and to reduce the weight supported by the nose-wheel.  

When the airplane is held at a nose-high   attitude throughout the takeoff   run,   the wings   increasingly   relieve the wheels   of   the airplane’s   weight as speed increases and lift develops, thereby minimizing the drag caused by surface irregularities or adhesion. If this attitude is  accurately maintained, the airplane virtually flies itself off the ground, becoming airborne but at an airspeed slower than a safe climb  speed because of ground effect.  [Figure 6-10]

Figure 6-10.  Soft-field takeoff.  

# Lift-Off  

After the airplane becomes airborne, the pilot should gently lower the nose with the wheels clear of the surface to allow the airplane  to accelerate to a minimum safe climb out speed, Immediately after the airplane becomes airborne and while it accelerates, the pilot  should be aware that, while transitioning out of the ground effect area, the airplane will have a tendency to settle back onto  the surface, even with full power applied. Therefore, it is essential that the airplane remain in ground effect until at least   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    is  reached. This requires a good understanding of the control pressures, aircraft responses, visual clues, and acceleration  characteristics of that particular airplane.  

# Initial Climb  

After a positive rate of climb is established, and the airplane has accelerated to  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , the pilot should retract the landing gear and flaps,  if equipped. If departing from an airstrip with wet snow or slush on the takeoff surface, the gear should not be retracted immediately  so that any wet snow or slush can be air-dried. In the event an obstacle needs to be cleared after a soft-field takeoff, the pilot should  perform the climb-out at   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    until the obstacle has been cleared. The pilot should then adjust the pitch attitude to   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    and retract the  gear and flaps. The power can then be reduced to the normal climb setting.  

Common errors in the performance of soft/rough field takeoff and climbs are:  

⦁  Failure to review AFM/POH and performance charts prior to takeoff.  ⦁  Failure to adequately clear the area.  ⦁  Insufficient back-elevator pressure during initial takeoff roll resulting in inadequate AOA.  ⦁  Failure to cross-check engine instruments for indications of proper operation after applying power.  ⦁  Poor directional control.  ⦁  Climbing too high after lift-off and not levelng off low enough to maintain ground effect attitude.  ⦁  Abrupt and/or excessive elevator control while attempting to level off and accelerate after liftoff.  ⦁  Allowing the airplane to "mush" or settle resulting in an inadvertant touchdown after lift-off.  ⦁  Attempting to climb our of ground effect area before attaining sufficient climb speed.  ⦁  Failure to anticipate an increase in pitch attitude as the airplane climbs our of ground effect.  

# Rejected Takeoff/Engine Failure  

Emergency or abnormal situations can occur during a takeoff that require a pilot to reject the takeoff while still on the runway.  Circumstances such as a malfunctioning powerplant, inadequate acceleration, runway incursion, or air traffic conflict may be reasons  for a rejected takeoff.  

Prior to takeoff, the pilot should identify a point along the runway at which the airplane should be airborne. If that point is reached  and the airplane is not airborne, immediate action should be taken to discontinue the takeoff. When properly planned and executed,  the airplane can be stopped on the remaining runway without using extraordinary measures, such as excessive braking that may result  in loss of directional control, airplane damage, and/or personal injury. The POH/AFM ground roll distances for take-off and landing  added together provide a good estimate of the total runway needed to accelerate and then stop.  

In the event a takeoff is rejected, the power is reduced to idle and maximum braking applied while maintaining directional control. If  it is necessary to shut down the engine due to a fire, the mixture control should be brought to the idle cutoff position and the magnetos  turned   off.   In   all cases, the manufacturer’s   emergency   procedure should   be followed.  

Urgency characterizes all power loss or engine failure occurrences after lift-off. In most instances, the pilot has only a few seconds  after an engine failure to decide what course of action to take and to execute it.  

In the event of an engine failure on initial climb-out, the pilot’s   first responsibility    to   maintain   aircraft control. At a climb   pitch   attitude without power, the airplane is at or near a stalling AOA. At the same time, the pilot may still be holding right rudder. The  pilot should immediately lower the nose to prevent a stall while moving the rudder to ensure coordinated flight. The pilot should  establish a controlled glide toward a plausible landing area, preferably straight ahead. Attempting to turn back to the takeoff runway  should not be attempted unless the pilot previously trained for an emergency turn-back and sufficient altitude exists.  

# Noise Abatement  

Aircraft noise problems are a major concern at many airports throughout the country. Many local communities have pressured  airports into developing specific operational procedures that help limit aircraft noise while operating over nearby areas. As a result,  noise abatement procedures have been developed for many of these airports that include standardized profiles and procedures to  achieve these lower noise goals.  

Airports that have noise abatement procedures provide information to pilots, operators, air carriers, air traffic facilities, and other  special groups that are applicable to their airport. These procedures are available to the aviation community by various means. Most  of this information comes from the Chart Supplements, local and regional publications, printed handouts, operator bulletin boards,  safety briefings, and local air traffic facilities.  

At airports that use noise abatement procedures, reminder signs may be installed at the taxiway hold positions for applicable runways  to remind pilots to use and comply with noise abatement procedures on departure. Pilots who are unfamiliar with these procedures  should ask the tower or air traffic facility for the recommended procedures. In any case, pilots should be considerate of the  surrounding community while operating their airplane to and from such an airport. This includes operating as quietly, and safely as  possible.  

# Chapter Summary  

The takeoff and initial climb are relatively short phases required for every flight and are often taken for granted, yet 1 out of 5  accidents occur during this phase and half the mishaps are the result of pilot error. Becoming proficient in and applying the  techniques and principles discussed in this chapter help pilots reduce their susceptibility to becoming a mishap statistic.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 7: Ground Reference Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

During initial training, pilots learn how various flight control pressure inputs affect the airplane. After achieving a sufficient level of  competence, the pilot is ready to apply  this skill and maintain the airplane, not only at the correct attitude and power configuration,  but also along an appropriate course relative to objects on the ground. This skill is the basis for traffic patterns, survey, photographic,  sight-seeing, aerial application (crop dusting), and various other flight profiles requiring specific flightpaths referenced to points on  the surface.  

Ground reference maneuvers are the principal flight maneuvers that combine the four fundamentals (straight-and-level, turns, climbs,  and descents) into a set of integrated skills that the pilot uses in everyday flight activity. From every takeoff to every landing, a pilot  exercises these skills to control the airplane. Therefore, a pilot needs to develop the proper coordination, timing, and attention in  order to accurately and safely maneuver the airplane with regard to the required attitudes and ground references.  

The pilot should be introduced by their instructor to ground reference maneuvers as soon as the pilot shows proficiency in the four  fundamentals. Ground reference  maneuvers call for manipulation of the flight controls using necessary control pressures to  affect the  airplane’s   attitude and   position   by   using   the outside natural horizon   and   ground-based references with brief periods of scanning the  flight instruments.  

# Maneuvering by Reference to Ground Objects  

Ground reference maneuvers train the pilot to accurately place the airplane in relationship to specific references and maintain a  desired ground track. While vision is the most utilized sense, other senses are actively involved at different levels. For example,  the  amount of pressure needed to overcome flight control surface forces provides tactile feedback as to the airplane's airspeed and  aerodynamic load.  

It is a common error for beginning pilots to fixate on a specific reference, such as a single location on the ground or a spot on the  natural horizon. A pilot fixating on any one reference loses the ability to determine rate, which significantly degrades a pilot’s   performance. By visually scanning across several references, the pilot learns how to determine the rate of closure to a specific point.  In addition, the pilot should scan between several visual references to determine relative motion and to determine if the airplane is  maintaining, or drifting to or from, the desired ground track. Consider a skilled automobile driver in a simple intersection turn; the  driver does not merely turn the steering wheel some degree and hope that it will work out. The driver picks out several references,  such as an island to their side, a painted lane line, or the opposing curb, and uses those references to make almost imperceptible  adjustments to the amount of deflection on the steering wheel. At the same time, the driver adjusts the pressure on the accelerator  pedal to smoothly join the new lane. In the same manner, multiple references are required to precisely control the airplane in  reference to the ground.  

Not all ground-based references are visually equal. Awareness of typical visual illusions helps a pilot select appropriate references.  For example, larger objects or references may appear closer than they actually are when compared to smaller objects or references.  Prevailing   visibility   has a significant effect on   the pilot’s   perception   of   the distance    a reference.   Excellent visibility   with clear skies  tends to make an object or reference appear closer than when compared to a hazy day with poor visibility. Rain can alter the visual  image in a manner creating an illusion of being at a higher than actual altitude, and brighter objects or references may appear closer  than dimmer objects. However, if using references of similar size and proportion, pilots find ground reference maneuvers easier to  execute.  

Ground-based references can be numerous. Examples include breakwaters, canals, fence lines, field boundaries, highways, railroad  tracks, roads, pipe lines, power lines, water tanks, and many other objects; however, choices can be limited by geography, population  density, infrastructure, or structures. The pilot should consider the type of maneuver being performed, altitude at which the maneuver  will be performed, emergency landing requirements, density of structures, wind direction, visibility, and the type of airspace when  selecting a ground-based reference.  

Ground reference maneuvers develop a pilot's division of attention skill. A pilot needs to control the airplane's attitude while tracking  a specific path over the ground. In addition, the pilot should be able to scan for hazards such as other aircraft, prepare for an  emergency landing should the need arise, and scan the flight and engine instruments at regular intervals to ensure that a pending  situation, such as decreasing oil pressure, does not turn into an unexpected incident.  

Ground reference maneuvers place the airplane in a low altitude environment with associated hazards. Pilots should look for other  aircraft, including helicopters, and look for obstructions such as radio towers and wires. In addition, pilots should consider engine  failure and have one or more locations available for an emergency landing. Pilots should always clear the area with two   $90^{\circ}$  clearing  turns looking to the left and the right, as well as above and below the airplane. The maneuver area should not cause disturbances and  be well away from any open air assembly of persons, congested areas of a city, town, or settlement, or herd of livestock. Before  performing any maneuver, the pilot should complete the required checklist items, make any radio announcements (such as on a  practice area frequency), and safety clearing turns. As a general note, a ground reference maneuver should not exceed a bank angle of   $45^{\circ}$   or an airspeed greater than the maneuvering speed. As part of preflight planning, the pilot should determine the predicted  (POH/AFM) stall speed at   $50^{\circ}$   or at the highest bank angle expected during the maneuver to assure there will be a safety margin  above the stall speed during the maneuver.  

# Drift and Ground Track Control  

Wind direction and velocity variations create the need for flightpath corrections during a ground reference maneuver. In a similar way  that water currents affect the progress of a boat or ship, wind directly influences the path that the airplane travels in reference to the  ground. Whenever the airplane is in flight, the movement of the air directly affects the actual ground track of the airplane.  

For example, an airplane is traveling at 90 knots (90 nautical miles per hour) and the wind is blowing from right to left at 10 knots.  The airplane continues forward at 90 knots but also travels left 10 nautical miles for every hour of flight time. If the airplane, in this  example doubles its speed to 180 knots, it still drifts laterally to the left 10 nautical miles every hour. Unless in still air, traveling to a  point on the surface requires compensation for the movement of the air mass.  

Ground reference maneuvers are generally flown at altitudes between 600 and 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL). The pilot should  consider the following when selecting the maneuvering altitude:  

⦁  The lower the maneuvering altitude, the faster the airplane appears to travel in relation to the ground.  ⦁  Drift should be easily recognizable from both sides of the airplane.  

$\bullet$    The altitude should provide obstruction clearance of no less than 500 feet vertically above the obstruction      and 2,000 feet horizontally.  

⦁  In the event of an engine failure, lower altitudes equate to less time to configure the airplane and reduced      gliding distance before a forced landing.  

⦁  What specific altitude or altitude range does the testing standard call for?  

# Correcting Drift During Straight-and-Level Flight  

When flying straight and level and following a selected straight-line direct ground track, the preferred method of correcting for wind  drift is to angle the airplane sufficiently into the wind to cancel the effect of the sideways drift caused by the wind. The wind’s   speed,   the angle between   the wind   direction   and   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis,   and   the airspeed   of   the airplane determine the required wind  correction angle. For example, an airplane with an airspeed of 100 knots in an air mass moving at 20 knots directly from the side,  should turn   $12^{\circ}$   into the wind to cancel the airplane's drift. If the wind in the above example is only 10 knots, the wind correction  angle required to cancel the drift is six degrees. When the drift has been neutralized by heading the airplane into the wind, the  airplane will fly the direct straight ground track.  

To   further   illustrate this   point, if   a boat is   crossing   a river   and   the river’s   current is   completely   still,   the boat could   head directly to a  point on the opposite shore on a straight course without any drift. However, rivers tend to have a downstream current that needs to be  considered if the captain wants the boat to arrive at the opposite shore using a direct straight path. Any downstream current pushes the  boat sideways and downstream at the speed of the current. To counteract this downstream movement, the boat needs to move  upstream at the same speed as the river is moving the boat downstream. This is accomplished by angling the boat upstream to  counteract the downstream flow. If done correctly, the boat follows a direct straight track across the river to the intended destination  point. A slower forward speed of the boat or a faster river current requires a greater angle to counteract the drift.  [Figure 7-1]  

![](images/63448ad28fbdccc87b734b77aa70b0039045b12ad41182fae8b765d29c4d9e6d.jpg)  
Figure 7-1.  Wind drift.  

As soon as the pilot lifts off the surface and levels the wings in a crosswind, the airplane begins tracking sideways. The force of the  crosswind acts on the mass of the airplane, and the speed of drift increases up to the speed of the crosswind component. A wind that is  directly to the right or the left (at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle) will cause the airplane to accelerate sideways at the same speed as the wind. When the  wind is halfway between the side and the nose of the airplane (at a   $45^{\circ}$   angle), it causes a sideways drift up to just over 70 percent of  the total speed of the wind. It should be understood that pilots do not calculate the required drift correction angles for ground  reference   maneuvers; they   merely   use the references   and   adjust the airplane’s   relationship   to   those references   to   cancel any   drift. The  groundspeed   of   the airplane is   also   affected   by   the wind.   As   the wind   direction   becomes parallel to   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis,  the magnitude of   the wind’s   effect on   the groundspeed    greater; as the wind   becomes perpendicular   to   the longitudinal axis,   the  magnitude of   the wind’s   effect on   the groundspeed    less.   In   general,   When   the wind    blowing   straight into   the nose of   the   airplane,  the groundspeed will be less than the airspeed. When the wind is blowing from directly behind the airplane, the groundspeed will be  faster than the airspeed. In other words, when the airplane is headed upwind, the groundspeed is decreased; when headed downwind,  the groundspeed is increased.  

# Constant Radius During Turning Flight  

In a no-wind condition, a pilot may make a constant-radius turn over the ground using a fixed bank angle. If wind is present, however,  a pilot will observe a change in the radius of a turn while maintaining that same constant bank angle.  [Figure 7-2]  As groundspeed  increases, the observed radius of the turn increases. Conversely, as groundspeed decreases, the radius of the turn over the ground will  decrease. For a ground-referenced constant-radius turn, the pilot compensates for changes in groundspeed by varying the bank angle  throughout the turn. When groundspeed increases, the pilot banks more steeply to maintain a constant-radius turn over the ground.  The converse is also true: when groundspeed decreases, the pilot uses a shallower bank.  

![](images/1cd26ead7de8fe127226d763a3a895ccbdbd8e7009bdc1efc87495f56f27fd51.jpg)  
Figure 7-2.  Effect of wind during a turn.  

For a given true airspeed, the radius of turn in the air varies proportionally with the bank angle. To maintain a constant radius over the  ground, the bank angle used is proportional to groundspeed. For example, an airplane is in the downwind position at 100 knots  groundspeed. In this example, the wind is 10 knots, meaning that the airplane has an airspeed of 90 knots (for this discussion, assume  true, calibrated, and indicated airspeed are all the same). If the pilot starts a turn using a   $45^{\circ}$   bank angle, the turn radius over the  ground at that moment is approximately 890 feet. As the airplane turns, the groundspeed decreases and the bank angle needs to be  reduced in order to maintain the same turn radius of 890 feet over the ground. At the upwind point of the turn, the bank angle should  be approximately   $33^{\circ}$  . In another example, if the downwind is flown at an airspeed of 90 knots in a 10 knot tailwind with a desired  turn radius of 2,000 feet, the bank angle would be approximately 24°. The bank angle flying upwind would be approximately   $16^{\circ}$  .  

Put another way, at a higher groundspeed, there is less time to turn the airplane while trying to maintain a ground-referenced constant- radius turn. The pilot increases the bank angle in order to increase the rate of turn, and the increased rate of turn offsets the reduced  time available to make the turn. Conversely, when flying at a lower groundspeed, the pilot reduces the angle of bank and rate of turn  to compensate for the additional time taken while making the turn. With some experience, pilots may notice how wind direction  affects the time needed for various segments of ground-referenced turns.  

To demonstrate the effect that wind has on turns, the pilot should select a straight-line ground reference, such as a road or railroad  track.  [Figure 7-3]  Choosing a straight-line ground reference that is parallel to the wind, the airplane would be flown into the wind  and directly over the selected straight-line ground reference. Once a straight-line ground reference is established, the pilot makes a   $360^{\circ}$   constant medium-banked turn. As the airplane completes the   $360^{\circ}$   turn, it should return directly over the straight-line ground  reference but downwind from the starting point. Choosing a straight-line ground reference that has a crosswind, and using the same   $360^{\circ}$   constant medium-banked turn, demonstrates how the airplane drifts away from the reference even as the pilot holds a constant  bank angle. In both examples, the path over the ground is not circular, although in reference to the air, the airplane flew a perfect  continuous radius.  

![](images/2856f7d392b3e2ae4b6b26698971271a23a10c01bb07188c1d30a120dd9bbada.jpg)  
Figure 7-3.  Effect of wind during turn.  

In order to compensate for the effects of wind drift, the pilot adjusts the bank angle as the groundspeed changes throughout the turn.  Where groundspeed is the fastest, such as when the airplane is headed downwind, the bank angle should be steepest. Where  groundspeed is the slowest, such as when the airplane is headed upwind, the bank angle should be shallow. It is necessary to increase  or decrease the angle of bank, which increases or decreases the rate of turn, to achieve the desired constant radius track over the  ground.  

Ground reference maneuvers should always be entered from a downwind position. This allows the pilot to establish the steepest bank  angle required to maintain a constant radius ground track. If the bank is too steep, the pilot should immediately exit the maneuver and  re-establish a lateral position that is further from the ground reference. The pilot should avoid bank angles in excess of   $45^{\circ}$  due to the  increased stalling speed.  

# Tracking Over and Parallel to a Straight Line  

The pilot should first be introduced to ground reference maneuvers by correcting for the effects of a crosswind over a straight-line  ground reference, such as road or railroad tracks. If a straight road or railroad track is unavailable, the pilot should choose multiple  references (three minimum) which line up along a straight path. The reference line should be suitably long so the pilot has sufficient  time to understand the concepts of wind correction and practice the maneuver. Initially, the maneuver should be flown directly over  the ground   reference   line with   the pilot angling   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis   into   the wind   sufficiently   such   as to   cancel the effect  of drift. The pilot should scan between far ahead and close to the airplane to practice tracking multiple references.  

When proficiency has been demonstrated by flying directly over the ground reference line, the pilot should then practice flying a  straight parallel path that is offset from the ground reference. The offset parallel path should not be more than three-fourths of a mile  from   the reference   line.   The maneuver   should   be flown   offset from   the ground   references   with   the pilot angling   the airplane’s   longitudinal axis into the wind sufficiently to cancel the effect of drift while maintaining a parallel track.  

# Rectangular Course  

A principal ground reference maneuver is the rectangular course.  [Figure 7-4]  The rectangular course is a training maneuver in which  the airplane maintains an equal distance from all sides of the selected rectangular references. The maneuver is accomplished to  replicate the airport traffic pattern that an airplane typically maneuvers while landing. While performing the rectangular course  maneuver, the pilot should maintain a constant altitude, airspeed, and distance from the ground references. The maneuver assists the  pilot in practicing the following:  

⦁  Dividing attention between the flightpath, ground-based references, manipulating the flight controls, and      scanning for outside hazards and instrument indications.  ⦁  Adjusting the bank angle during turns to correct for groundspeed changes in order to maintain constant-     radius turns.  ⦁  Rolling out from a turn with the required wind correction angle to compensate for any drift caused by the      wind.  ⦁  Establishing and correcting the wind correction angle in order to maintain the track over the ground.  ⦁  Preparing the pilot for the airport traffic pattern and subsequent landing pattern practice.  

To fly the rectangular course, the pilot should first locate a square field, a rectangular field, or an area with suitable ground references  on all four sides. Note that a square meets the definition of a rectangle. As previously mentioned, this area should be selected  consistent with safe practices.  The airplane should be  flown parallel to and at an equal distance between one-half to three-fourths of a  mile away from the field boundaries or selected ground references. The flightpath should be positioned outside the field boundaries or  selected ground references so that the references may be easily observed from either pilot seat. It is not practical to fly directly above  the field boundaries or selected ground references. The pilot should avoid flying close to the references, as this will require the pilot  to   turn   using   very   steep   bank   angles, thereby   increasing   aerodynamic load   factor   and   the airplane’s   stall speed,   especially   in the  downwind to crosswind turn.  

![](images/c0e5010a9fb83c7c50cfa5c683b072f7eb540964d4e6aeff0c6a340af11639c6.jpg)  
Figure 7-4 .   Rectangular course.  

The entry into the maneuver should be accomplished downwind. This places the wind on the tail of the airplane and results in an  increased groundspeed. There should be no wind correction angle if the wind is directly on the tail of the airplane; however, a real- world situation often results in some drift correction. The turn from the downwind leg onto the base leg is entered with a relatively  steep bank angle. The pilot should roll the airplane into a steep bank with rapid, but not excessive, coordinated aileron and rudder  pressures. As the airplane turns onto the following base leg, the tailwind lessens and becomes a crosswind; the bank angle is reduced  gradually with coordinated aileron and rudder pressures. The pilot should be prepared for the lateral drift and compensate by turning  more than   $90°$   angling toward the inside of the rectangular course.  

The next leg is where the airplane turns from a base leg position to the upwind leg. Ideally, on the upwind, the wind is directly on the  nose of the airplane resulting in a direct headwind and decreased groundspeed; however, some drift correction may be necessary. The  pilot should roll the airplane into a medium-banked turn with coordinated aileron and rudder pressures. As the airplane turns onto the  upwind leg, the crosswind lessens and becomes a headwind, and the bank angle is gradually reduced with coordinated aileron and  rudder pressures. Because the pilot was angled into the wind on the base leg, the turn to the upwind leg is less than   $90°$  .  

The next leg is where the airplane turns from an upwind leg position to the crosswind leg. The pilot should slowly roll the airplane  into a shallow-banked turn, as the developing crosswind drifts the airplane into the inside of the rectangular course with coordinated  aileron and rudder pressures. As the airplane turns onto the crosswind leg, the headwind lessens and becomes a crosswind. As the turn  nears completion, the bank angle is reduced with coordinated aileron and rudder pressures. To compensate for the crosswind, the  pilot maintains an angle into the wind, toward the outside of the rectangular course, which requires the turn to be less than   $90°$  .  

The final turn is back to the downwind leg, which requires a medium-banked angle and a turn greater than 90°. The groundspeed will  be increasing as the turn progresses and the bank should be held and then rolled out in a rapid, but not excessive, manner using  coordinated aileron and rudder pressures.  

For the maneuver to be executed properly, the pilot should visually utilize the ground-based, nose, and wingtip references to properly  position the airplane in attitude and in orientation to the rectangular course. In order to maintain a constant ground-based radius  during the turns, each turn requires the bank angle to be adjusted to compensate for the changing groundspeed—the higher the  groundspeed, the steeper the bank. If the groundspeed is initially higher and then decreases throughout the turn, the bank angle should  progressively decrease throughout the turn. The converse is also true, if the groundspeed is initially slower and then increases  throughout the turn, the bank angle should progressively increase throughout the turn until rollout is started. Also, the rate for rolling  in and out of the turn should be adjusted to prevent drifting in or out of the course. When the wind is from a direction that could drift  the airplane into the course, the banking roll rate should be slow. When the wind is from a direction that could drift the airplane to the  outside of the course, the banking roll rate should be quick.  

The following are the most common errors made while performing rectangular courses:  

1. Failure to adequately clear the surrounding area for safety hazards, initially and throughout the maneuver.  2. Failure to establish a constant, level altitude prior to entering the maneuver.  3. Failure to maintain altitude during the maneuver.  4. Failure to properly assess wind direction.  5. Failure to establish the appropriate wind correction angle.  6. Failure to apply coordinated aileron and rudder pressure, resulting in slips and skids.  7. Failure to manipulate the flight controls in a smooth and continuous manner.  8. Failure to properly divide attention between airplane control and orientation with ground references.  9. Failure to execute turns with accurate timing.  

# Turns Around a Point  

Turns around a point are a logical extension of both the rectangular course and S-turns   across   a road.   The maneuver   is   a   $360^{\circ}$  constant radius turn around a single ground-based reference point.  [Figure 7-5]  The principles are the same in any turning ground  reference maneuver—higher groundspeeds require steeper banks and slower ground speeds require shallower banks. The objectives  of turns around a point are as follows:  

⦁  Dividing attention between the flightpath, ground-based references, manipulating the flight controls, and      scanning for outside hazards and instrument indications.  ⦁  Adjusting the bank angle during turns to correct for groundspeed changes in order to maintain a constant      radius turn — steeper bank angles for higher ground speeds, shallow bank angles for slower groundspeeds.  ⦁  Improving competency in managing the quickly-changing bank angles.  ⦁  Establishing and adjusting the wind correction angle in order to maintain the track over the ground.  ⦁  Developing the ability to compensate for drift in quickly-changing orientations.  

⦁  Developing further awareness that the radius of a turn is correlated to the bank angle.  

To   perform   a turn   around   a point, the pilot needs   to   complete at least one   $360^{\circ}$   turn; however,   to   properly   assess   wind   direction,  velocity, bank required, and other factors related to turns in wind, the pilot should complete two or more turns. As in other ground  reference   maneuvers,   when   wind    present, the pilot adjusts   the airplane’s   bank   and   wind   correction   angle to   maintain   a constant  radius turn around a point. In contrast to the ground reference maneuvers discussed previously, in which turns were approximately  limited   to   either    $90°$   or    $180^{\circ}$  , turns   around   a point are consecutive   $360^{\circ}$   turns,   where pilot constantly   adjusts   the bank   angle   and the  resulting rate of turn as the airplane sequences through the various wind directions. The pilot should make these adjustments by  applying coordinated aileron and rudder pressure throughout the turn.

When performing a turn around a point, the pilot should select a prominent, ground-based reference that is easily distinguishable yet  small enough to present a precise reference. The pilot should enter the maneuver downwind, where the groundspeed is at its fastest, at  the appropriate radius of turn and distance from the selected ground-based reference point. In a high-wing airplane, the lowered wing  may block the view of the ground reference point, especially in airplanes with side-by-side seating during a left turn (assuming that  the pilot is flying from the left seat). To prevent this, the pilot may need to change the maneuvering altitude or the desired turn radius.  The pilot should ensure that the reference point is visible at all times throughout the maneuver, even with the wing lowered in a bank.  

Upon   entering   the maneuver,   depending   on   the wind’s   speed,   it may   be necessary    roll into   the initial bank   at a rapid   rate so that the  steepest bank is set quickly to prevent the airplane from drifting outside of the desired turn radius. This is best accomplished by  repeated practice and assessing the required roll in rate. Thereafter, the pilot should gradually decrease the angle of bank until the  airplane is headed directly upwind. As the upwind becomes a crosswind and then a downwind, the pilot should gradually steepen the  bank to the steepest angle upon reaching the initial point of entry.  

During   the downwind   half   of   the turn,   the pilot should   progressively   adjust the airplane’s   heading   toward   the inside of   the turn.  During   the upwind   half,   the pilot should   progressively   adjust the airplane’s   heading   toward   the outside of   the turn.   Put another way,  the airplane’s   heading   should   be ahead   of   its   position   over   the ground   during   the downwind   half   of   the turn   and   behind   its   position  during the upwind half. Remember that the goal is to make a constant-radius turn over the ground and, because the airplane is flying  through a moving air mass, the pilot should constantly adjust the bank angle to achieve this goal.  

The following are the most common errors in the performance of turns around a point:  

1. Failure to adequately clear the surrounding area for safety hazards, initially and throughout the maneuver.  2. Failure to establish a constant, level altitude prior to entering the maneuver.  3. Failure to maintain altitude during the maneuver.  4. Failure to properly assess wind direction.  5. Failure to properly execute constant-radius turns.  6. Failure to manipulate the flight controls in a smooth and continuous manner.  7. Failure to establish the appropriate wind correction angle.  8. Failure to apply coordinated aileron and rudder pressure, resulting in slips or skids.  

# S-Turns  

An S-turn    a ground   reference   maneuver   in   which   the airplane’s   ground   track   resembles two   opposite but equal half-circles on each  side of a selected ground-based straight-line reference.  [Figure 7-6]  This ground reference maneuver presents a practical application  for the correction of wind during a turn. The objectives of S-turns across a road (or line) are as follows:  

⦁  Maintaining a specific relationship between the airplane and the ground.  

⦁  Dividing attention between the flightpath, ground-based references, manipulating the flight controls, and      scanning for outside hazards and instrument indications.  ⦁  Adjusting the bank angle during turns to correct for groundspeed changes in order to maintain a constant-     radius turn—steeper bank angles for higher groundspeeds, shallow bank angles for slower groundspeeds.  ⦁  Rolling out from a turn with the required wind correction angle to compensate for any drift cause by the      wind.  ⦁  Establishing and correcting the wind correction angle in order to maintain the track over the ground.  ⦁  Developing the ability to compensate for drift in quickly-changing orientations.  

![](images/28e169d42fbc2c424a245f9d597233dd259a3d9f16cbcdc35d1d7a4ccb84c6c8.jpg)  
Figure 7-6.  S-turns.  

With the airplane in the downwind position, the maneuver consists of crossing a straight-line ground reference at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle and  immediately beginning a   $180^{\circ}$   constant-radius turn. The pilot will then adjust the roll rate and bank angle for drift effects and changes  in groundspeed, and re-cross the straight-line ground reference in the opposite direction just as the first   $180^{\circ}$   constant-radius turn is  completed. The pilot will then immediately begin a second   $180^{\circ}$   constant-radius turn in the opposite direction, adjusting the roll rate  and bank angle for drift effects and changes in groundspeed, again re-crossing the straight-line ground reference as the second   $180^{\circ}$    constant-radius turn is completed. If the straight-line ground reference is of sufficient length, the pilot may complete as many as can  be safely accomplished.  

In the same manner as the rectangular course, it is standard practice to enter ground-based maneuvers downwind where groundspeed  is greatest. As such, the roll into the turn should be rapid, but not aggressive, and the angle of bank should be steepest when initiating  the turn. As the turn progresses, the bank angle and the rate of rollout should be decreased as the groundspeed decreases to ensure  that the turn’s   radius    constant. During   the first turn,   when   the airplane is   at the  $90°$   point, it will be directly   crosswind. In addition to  the rate of rollout and bank angle, the pilot should control the wind correction angle throughout the turn.  

Controlling the wind correction angle during a turn can be complex to understand. The concept may be understood by comprehending  the difference between the number of degrees that the airplane has turned over the ground versus the number of degrees that the  airplane has turned in the air. As an example, assume the airplane is exactly crosswind, meaning directly at a point that is   $90°$   to the  straight-lined ground reference. In this example, if the wind requires a   $10^{\circ}$   wind correction angle (for this example, this is a left turn  with the crosswind from the left), the airplane would be at a heading that is   $10^{\circ}$   ahead when directly over the   $90^{\circ}$   ground reference  point. In other words, the first   $90^{\circ}$   track over the ground would result in a heading change of   $100^{\circ}$   and the last   $90^{\circ}$   track over the  ground would result in 80° of heading change.  

As the turn progresses from a downwind position to an upwind position, the pilot should gradually decrease the bank angle with  coordinated   aileron   and   rudder   pressure.   The pilot should   reference   the airplane’s   nose,   wingtips,   and   the ground   references   and  adjust the rollout timing so that the wings become level just as the airplane crosses the straight-line ground reference at the proper  heading, altitude, and airspeed. As the airplane re-crosses the straight-lined ground reference, the opposite turn begins—there should  be no delay in rolling out from one turn and rolling into the next turn. Because the airplane is now upwind, the roll in should be  smooth and gentle and the initial bank angle should be shallow. As the turn progresses, the wind changes from upwind, to crosswind,  to downwind. In a similar manner described above, the pilot should adjust the bank angle to correct for changes in groundspeed. As  the groundspeed increases, the pilot should increase the bank angle to maintain a constant-radius turn over the ground. At the   $90°$    crosswind position, the airplane should also have the correct wind correction angle. As the airplane turns downwind and the  groundspeed increases, the bank angle should be increased so that the rate of turn maintains a constant-radius turn.  

The following are the most common errors made while performing S-turns across a road:  

1. Failure to adequately clear surrounding area for safety hazards, initially and throughout the maneuver.  2. Failure to establish a constant, level altitude prior to entering the maneuver.  3. Failure to maintain altitude during the maneuver.  4. Failure to properly assess wind direction.  5. Failure to properly execute constant-radius turns.  6. Failure to manipulate the flight controls in a smooth and continuous manner when transitioning into turns.  7. Failure to establish the appropriate wind correction angle.  8. Failure to apply coordinated aileron and rudder pressure, resulting in slips or skids.  

# Elementary Eights  

Elementary eights are a family of maneuvers in which each individual maneuver is one that the airplane tracks a path over the ground  similar to the shape of a figure eight. There are various types of eights, progressing from the elementary to advanced types. Each eight  is   intended    develop   a pilot’s   flight control coordination   skills,   strengthen   their   awareness   relative to   the selected   ground references,  and enhance division of attention so that flying becomes more instinctive than mechanical. Eights require a greater degree of focused  attention to the selected ground references; however, the real significance of eights is that the pilot develops the ability to fly with  precision.  

Elementary eights include eights along a road, eights across a road, and eights around pylons. Each of these maneuvers is a variation  of a turn around a point. Each eight uses two ground reference points about which the airplane turns first in one direction and then the  opposite direction—like a figure eight.  

Eights maneuvers are designed for the following purposes:  

⦁  Further   development of   the pilot’s   skill in   maintaining   a specific relationship   between   the airplane and   the       ground references.  ⦁  Improving   the pilot’s   ability    divide attention   between   the flightpath   and   ground-based references,      manipulation of the flight controls, and scanning for outside hazards and instrument indications during both      turning and straight-line flight.  ⦁  Developing   the pilot’s   skills    visualize   each   specific segment of   the maneuver   and   the maneuver   as a       whole, prior to execution.  ⦁  Developing   a pilot’s   ability    intuitively   manipulate flight controls    adjust the bank   angle during   turns   to       correct for groundspeed changes in order to maintain constant-radius turns and proper ground track between      ground references.  

# Eights Along a Road  

An eight along a road is a ground reference maneuver in which the ground track consists of two opposite   $360^{\circ}$   adjacent turns. An  imaginary line drawn through the center of each   $360^{\circ}$   turn is perpendicular to the straight-line ground reference (road, railroad tracks,  fence line, pipeline right-of-way, etc.) as illustrated in Figure 7-7. Like the other ground reference maneuvers, the objective is to  further develop division of attention while compensating for drift, maintaining orientation with ground references, and maintaining a  constant altitude.  

![](images/41f0f9247570ab4c96e6e750c32e40f021902c8e91342cd40988e530cd273a75.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.  Eights along a road.  

Although eights along a road may be performed with the wind blowing parallel or perpendicular to the straight-line ground reference,  only the perpendicular wind situation is explained since the principles involved are common to each. The pilot should select a  straight-line ground reference that is perpendicular to the wind and position the airplane parallel to and directly above the straight-line  ground reference. Since this places the airplane in a crosswind position, the pilot should compensate for the wind drift with an  appropriate wind correction angle.  

The following description is illustrated in  Figure 7-7 . The airplane is initially in a crosswind position, perpendicular to the wind, and  over the ground-based reference. The first turn should be to the right toward a downwind position starting with a steepening bank.  When the entry is made into the turn, it requires that the turn begin with a medium bank and gradually steepen to its maximum bank  angle when the airplane is directly downwind. As the airplane turns from downwind to crosswind, the bank angle needs to be  gradually reduced since groundspeed is decreasing; however, 1/2 of the reduction in groundspeed occurs during the first 2/3 of the  turn from downwind to crosswind.  

The pilot needs to control the bank angle as well as the rate at which the bank angle is reduced so that the wind correction angle is  correct. Assuming that the wind is coming from the right side of the airplane, the airplane heading should be slightly ahead of its  position over the ground. When the airplane completes the first   $180^{\circ}$   of ground track, it is directly crosswind, and the airplane should  be at the maximum wind correction angle.  

As   the turn    continued   toward   the upwind,   the airplane’s   groundspeed    decreasing,   which   requires the pilot to   reduce   the bank  angle to slow the rate of turn. If the pilot does not reduce the bank angle, the continued high rate of turn would cause the turn to be  completed prematurely. Another way to explain this effect is—the wind is drifting the airplane downwind at the same time its  groundspeed is slowing. If the airplane has a steeper-than-required bank angle, its rate of turn will be too fast and the airplane will  complete the turn before it has had time to return to the ground reference.  

When the airplane is directly upwind, which is at   $270^{\circ}$   into the first turn, the bank angle should be shallow with no wind correction.  As   the airplane turns   crosswind   again,   the airplane’s   groundspeed   begins   increasing; therefore,   the pilot should   adjust the bank angle  and corresponding rate of turn proportionately in order to reach the ground reference at the completion of the   $360^{\circ}$   ground track. The  pilot may vary the bank angle to correct for any previous errors made in judging the returning rate and closure rate. The pilot should  time the rollout so that the airplane is straight-and-level over the starting point with enough drift correction to hold it over the straight- line ground reference. Assuming that the wind is now from the left, the airplane should be banked at a left wind correction angle.  

After momentarily flying straight-and-level with the established wind correction, along the ground reference, the pilot should roll the  airplane into a medium bank-turn in the opposite direction to begin the   $360^{\circ}$   turn on the upwind side of the ground reference. The  wind   will decrease the airplane’s   groundspeed   and   drift the airplane back   toward   the ground   reference; therefore,   the pilot should  decrease the bank slowly during the first   $90^{\circ}$   of the upwind turn in order to establish a constant radius. During the next   $90^{\circ}$   of turn,  the pilot should increase the bank angle, since the groundspeed is increasing, to maintain a constant radius and establish the proper  wind correction angle before reaching the   $180^{\circ}$   upwind position.  

As the remaining   $180^{\circ}$   of turn continues, the wind becomes a tailwind and then a crosswind. Consistent with previous downwind and  crosswind descriptions, the pilot should increase the bank angle as the airplane reaches the downwind position and decrease the bank  angle as the airplane reaches the crosswind position. Further, the rate of roll-in and roll-out should be consistent with how fast the  groundspeed changes during the turn. Remember, when turning from an upwind or downwind position to a crosswind position,   $1/2$   of  the groundspeed change occurs during the first 2/3 of the  $90^{\circ}$   turn. The final 1/2 of the change in groundspeed occurs during the last   $1/3$   of the turn. In contrast, when turning from a crosswind position to an upwind or downwind position, the first 1/2 of the  groundspeed change occurs during the first 1/3 of the   $90^{\circ}$   turn. The final   $1/2$   of the change in groundspeed occurs during the last 2/3  of the turn.  

To successfully perform eights along a ground reference, the pilot should be able to smoothly and accurately coordinate changes in  bank angle to maintain a constant-radius turn and counteract drift. The speed in which the pilot can anticipate these corrections  directly affects the accuracy of the overall maneuver and the amount of attention that can be directed toward scanning for outside  hazards and instrument indications.  

# Eights Across a Road  

This maneuver is a variation of eights along a road and involves the same principles and techniques. The primary difference is that at  the completion of each loop of the figure eight, the airplane should cross an intersection or a specific ground reference point.  [Figure  7-8]  

![](images/d8db48ede4ed0b901a8854002b9f115bfd242947a61adf5dee6f52133f177276.jpg)  
Figure 7-8.  Eights across a road.  

The loops should be across the road and the wind should be perpendicular to the loops. Each time the reference is crossed, the  crossing angle should be the same, and the wings of the airplane should be level. The eights may also be performed by rolling from  one bank immediately to the other, directly over the reference.  

# Eights Around Pylons  

Eights around pylons is a ground reference maneuver with the same principles and techniques of correcting for wind drift as used in  turns around a point and the same objectives as other ground track maneuvers. Eights around pylons utilizes two ground reference  points   called   “pylons.” Turns   around   each   pylon   are made in   opposite directions   to   follow   a ground   track   in   the form   of   a figure 8.  [Figure 7-9]  

![](images/9843025655ac3f66f2f6664b6bbbc9acd3c360f2eab8eb81406a872adb28a615.jpg)  
Figure 7-9.  Eights around pylons  

The pattern involves flying downwind between the pylons and upwind outside of the pylons. It may include a short period of straight­ and-level flight while proceeding diagonally from one pylon to the other. The pylons should be on a line perpendicular to the wind.  The maneuver should be started with the airplane on a downwind heading while passing mid-way between the pylons. The distance  between the pylons and the wind velocity determines the initial angle of bank required to maintain a constant turn radius from the  pylons during each turn. The steepest banks are necessary just after each turn entry and just before the rollout from each turn where  the airplane is headed downwind and the groundspeed is highest. The shallowest banks are when the airplane is headed directly  upwind and the groundspeed is lowest.  

As in other ground reference maneuvers, the rate at which the bank angle changes depends on the wind velocity. If the airplane  proceeds diagonally from one turn to the other, the rollout from each turn needs to be completed on the proper heading with sufficient  wind correction angle to ensure that after brief straight-and-level flight, the airplane arrives at the point where a turn of the same  radius can be made around the other pylon. The straight-and-level flight segments should be tangent to both circular patterns.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of elementary eights are:  

1. Failure to adequately clear the surrounding area for safety hazards, initially and throughout the maneuver.  2. Poor selection of ground references.  3. Failure to establish a constant, level altitude prior to entering the maneuver.  4. Failure to maintain adequate altitude control during the maneuver.  5. Failure to properly assess wind direction.  6. Failure to properly execute constant-radius turns.  7. Failure to manipulate the flight controls in a smooth and continuous manner.  8. Failure to establish the appropriate wind correction angles.  9. Failure to apply coordinated aileron and rudder pressure, resulting in slips or skids.  10. Failure to maintain orientation as the maneuver progresses.  

# Eights on Pylons  

The eights on pylons is the most advanced and difficult of the ground-reference maneuvers. Because of the techniques involved, the  eights on pylons are unmatched for developing intuitive control of the airplane. Similar to eights around pylons except altitude is  varied to maintain a specific visual reference to the pivot points.  

When performing eights on pylons, the pilot imagines there is a line parallel to the airplane's lateral axis that extends from   the pilot’s   eyes to the pylon. Along this line, the airplane appears to pivot as it turns around the pylon. In other words, if a taut string extended  from the pilot's eyes to the pylon, the string would remain parallel to lateral axis as the airplane makes a turn around the pylon. The  goal of eights on pylons is to keep the line from the pilot's eyes to the pylon parallel to the lateral axis. The string should not be at an  angle to the lateral axis while the airplane flies around the pylon.  [Figure 7-10]  When explaining eights on pylons, instructors  sometimes use the term   “wingtip” to   represent the proper   visual reference   line to   the pylon.   This   interpretation    not correct. High- wing, low-wing, swept-wing, and tapered-wing airplanes, as well as those with tandem or side-by-side seating, all present different  angles from   the pilot’s   eye to   the wingtip.   [Figure 7-11]  

![](images/b5db1fd4de62bef313f4a4062434e97330ae628afc5698f48da4c83a9a53eca0.jpg)  
Figure 7-10.  Eights on pylons.  

The visual reference line, while not necessarily on the wingtip itself, may be positioned in relation to the wingtip (ahead, behind,  above, or below), and differs for each pilot and from each seat in the airplane. This is especially true in tandem (fore and aft) seat  airplanes. In side-by-side type airplanes, there is very little variation in the visual reference lines for different people, if those people  are seated with their eyes at approximately the same level. Therefore, in the correct performance of eights on pylons, as in other  maneuvers requiring a lateral reference, the pilot should use a visual reference line that, from eye level, parallels the lateral axis of the  airplane.  

![](images/845d2c9990aa49ec981a46b3b2116188348d5f6ea12c75739080cc8068d700c8.jpg)  
Figure 7-11.  Line of sight.  

The altitude that is   appropriate for   eights   on   pylons    called   the “pivotal altitude”   and    determined   by   the airplane's   groundspeed. In  previous ground-track maneuvers, the airplane flies a prescribed path over the ground and the pilot attempts to maintain the track by  correcting for the wind. With eights on pylons, the pilot maintains lateral orientation to a specific spot on the ground. This develops  the pilot’s   ability   to   maneuver   the airplane accurately   while dividing   attention   between   the flightpath   and   the selected   pylons on the  ground.  

An explanation of the pivotal altitude is also essential. First, a good rule of thumb for estimating the pivotal altitude is to square the  groundspeed, then divide by 15 (if the groundspeed is in miles per hour) or divide by 11.3 (if the groundspeed is in knots), and then  add the mean sea level (MSL) altitude of the ground reference. The pivotal altitude is the altitude at which, for a given groundspeed,  the projection of the visual reference line to the pylon appears to pivot. Visually, a taut string, if extended from the pilot's eyes to the  pylon, would remain parallel to lateral axis as the airplane makes a turn around the pylon.  [Figure 7-12]  The pivotal altitude does not  vary with the angle of bank unless the bank is steep enough to affect the groundspeed.  

![](images/a81d9f24dd81427112ebbb7c0d5958b475e365e81e646e32578887f4c8afd35d.jpg)  

Distance from the pylon affects the angle of bank. At any altitude above that pivotal altitude, the projected reference line appears to  move rearward in a circular path in relation to the pylon. Conversely, when the airplane is below the pivotal altitude, the projected  reference line appears to move forward in a circular path.  [Figure 7-13]  To demonstrate this, the pilot will fly at maneuvering speed  and at an altitude below the pivotal altitude, and then place the airplane in a medium-banked turn. The projected visual reference line  appears to move forward along the ground (pylon appears to move back) as the airplane turns. The pilot then executes a climb to an  altitude well above the pivotal altitude. When the airplane is again at maneuvering speed, it is placed in a medium-banked turn. At the  higher altitude, the projected visual reference line appears to move backward across the ground (pylon appears to move forward).  

![](images/8b2942fc52d1cc7a183b1602459e781dee438db70750b40f42e255012858a04b.jpg)  
Figure 7-13.  Effect of different altitudes on line of sight.  

After demonstrating the maneuver at a high altitude, the pilot should reduce power and begin a descent at maneuvering speed in a  continuing medium-bank turn around the pylon. The apparent backward movement of the projected visual reference line with respect  to the pylon will slow down as altitude is lost and will eventually stop for an instant. If the pilot continues the descent below the  pivotal altitude, the projected visual reference line with respect to the pylon will begin to move forward.  

The altitude at which the visual reference line ceases to move across the ground is the pivotal altitude. If the airplane descends below  the pivotal altitude, the pilot should increase power to maintain airspeed while regaining altitude to the point at which the projected  reference line moves neither backward nor forward but actually pivots on the pylon. In this way, the pilot can determine the pivotal  altitude of the airplane.  

The pivotal altitude changes with variations in groundspeed. Since the headings throughout turns continuously vary from downwind  to upwind, the groundspeed constantly changes. This results in the proper pivotal altitude varying slightly throughout the turn. The  pilot should adjust for this by climbing or descending, as necessary, to hold the visual reference line on the pylons.  

Selecting proper pylons is an important factor of successfully performing eights on pylons. They should be sufficiently prominent so  the pilot can view them when completing the turn around one pylon and heading for the next. They should also be adequately spaced  to provide time for planning the turns but not spaced so far apart that they cause unnecessary straight-and-level flight between the  pylons. The distance between the pylons should allow for the straight-and-level flight segment to last from 3 to 5 seconds. The  selected pylons should also be at the same elevation, since differences of over a few feet necessitate climbing or descending between  each turn. The pilot should select two pylons along a line that lies perpendicular to the direction of the wind.  

The pilot should estimate the pivotal altitude during preflight planning. Weather reports and consultation with other pilots flying in  the area may provide both the wind direction and velocity. If the references are previously known (many flight instructors already  have these ground-based   references   selected),   the sectional chart will provide the MSL   of   the references,   the Pilot’s   Operating   Handbook (POH) provides the range of maneuvering airspeeds (based on weight), and the wind direction and velocity can be  estimated to calculate the appropriate pivotal altitudes. The pilot should calculate the pivotal altitude for each position: upwind,  downwind, and crosswind.  

The pilot should begin the eight on pylons maneuver by flying diagonally crosswind between the pylons to a point downwind from  the first pylon, so that the first turn can be made into the wind. As the airplane approaches a position where the pylon appears to be  just ahead of the wingtip, the pilot should begin the turn by lowering the upwind wing to the point where the visual reference line  aligns with the pylon. The reference line should appear to pivot on the pylon. As the airplane heads upwind, the groundspeed  decreases, which lowers the pivotal altitude. As a result, the pilot should descend to hold the visual reference line on the pylon. As the  turn progresses on the upwind side of the pylon, the wind becomes more of a crosswind. Since this maneuver does not require the turn  to be completed at a constant radius, the pilot does not need to apply drift correction to complete the turn.  

If the visual reference line appears to move ahead of the pylon (pylon appears to move back), the pilot should increase altitude. If the  visual reference line appears to move behind the pylon (pylon appears to move ahead), the pilot should decrease altitude. Deflecting  the rudder to yaw the airplane and force the wing and reference line forward or backward to the pylon places the airplane in  uncoordinated flight, at low altitude, with steep bank angles and should not be attempted.  

As the airplane turns toward a downwind heading, the pilot should rollout from the turn to allow the airplane to proceed diagonally to  a point tangent on the downwind side of the second pylon. The pilot should complete the rollout with the proper wind correction  angle to correct for wind drift, so that the airplane arrives at a point downwind from the second pylon that is equal in distance from  the pylon as the corresponding point was from the first pylon at the beginning of the maneuver.  

At this point, the pilot should begin a turn in the opposite direction by lowering the upwind wing to the point where the visual  reference line aligns with the pylon. The pilot should then continue the turn the same way the corresponding turn was performed  around the first pylon but in the opposite direction.  

With prompt correction, and a very fine control pressures, it is possible to hold the visual reference line directly on the pylon even in  strong winds. The pilot may make corrections for temporary variations, such as those caused by gusts or inattention, by reducing the  bank angle slightly to fly relatively straight to bring forward a lagging visual reference line or by increasing the bank angle  temporarily to turn back a visual reference line that has moved ahead. With practice, these corrections may become slight enough to  be barely noticeable. It is important to understand that variations in pylon position are according to the apparent movement of the  visual reference line. Attempting to correct pivotal altitude by the using the altimeter is ineffective.  

Eights on pylons are performed at bank angles ranging from shallow to steep.  [Figure 7-14]  The pilot should understand that the  bank chosen does not alter the pivotal altitude. As proficiency is gained, the instructor should increase the complexity of the  maneuver by directing the learner to enter at a distance from the pylon that results in a specific bank angle at the steepest point in the  pylon turn.

# Common Errors  

The most common error in attempting to hold a pylon is incorrect use of the rudder. When the projection of the visual reference line  moves forward with respect to the pylon, many pilots tend to apply inside rudder pressure to yaw the wing backward. When the  reference line moves behind the pylon, pilots tend to apply outside rudder pressure to yaw the wing forward. The pilot should use the  rudder only for coordination.  

Other common errors in the performance of eights on pylons are:  

1. Failure to adequately clear the surrounding area for safety hazards, initially and throughout the maneuver.  2. Skidding or slipping in turns (whether trying to hold the pylon with rudder or not).  3. Excessive gain or loss of altitude.  4. Poor choice of pylons.  5. Not entering the pylon turns into the wind.  6. Failure to assume a heading when flying between pylons that will compensate sufficiently for drift.  7. Failure to time the bank so that the turn entry is completed with the pylon in position.  8. Abrupt control usage.  9. Inability to select pivotal altitude.  

# Chapter Summary  

Ground reference maneuvers require planning and high levels of vigilance to ensure that the practice and performance of these  maneuvers are executed where the safety to groups of people, livestock, communities, and the pilot is not compromised. While  training to perform ground reference maneuvers, a pilot learns coordination, timing, and division of attention to maneuver the  airplane accurately in reference to flight attitudes and specific ground references. After mastering ground reference maneuvers, the  pilot should be able to command the airplane to specific pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes, correct for the effects of wind drift, and control  the airplane’s   orientation   in   relation   to   ground-based references. While safety is paramount in all aspects of flying, ground reference  maneuvers focus on mitigation of risk during low altitude flying. With these enhanced skills, the pilot also significantly improves their  competency in everyday flight maneuvers, such as straight-and-level, turns, climbs, and descents.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 8: Airport Traffic Patterns  

# Introduction  

Airport traffic patterns ensure that air traffic moves into and out of an airport safely. The direction and placement of the pattern, the  altitude at which it is to be flown, and the procedures for entering and exiting the pattern may depend on local conditions. Information  regarding the procedures for a specific airport can be found in the Chart Supplements. General information on airport operations and  traffic patterns can also be found in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

# Airport Traffic Patterns and Operations  

Just as roads and streets are essential for operating automobiles, airports or airstrips are essential for operating airplanes. Since flight  begins and ends at an airport or other suitable landing field, pilots need to learn the traffic rules, traffic procedures, and traffic pattern  layouts in use at various airports.  

When an automobile is driven on congested city streets, it can be brought to a stop to give way to conflicting traffic. Airplane pilots  do not have that option. Consequently, traffic patterns and traffic control procedures exist to minimize conflicts during takeoffs,  departures, arrivals, and landings. The exact nature of each airport traffic pattern is dependent on the runway in use, wind conditions  (which determine the runway in use), obstructions, and other factors.  

Airports vary in complexity from small grass or sod strips to major terminals with paved runways and taxiways. Regardless of the  type of airport, a pilot should know and abide by the applicable rules and operating procedures. In addition to checking the traffic  pattern and operating procedures for airports of intended use in the Chart Supplements, pilots should know how to interpret any  airport visual markings and signs that may be encountered. In total, the information provided to the pilot keeps air traffic moving with  maximum   safety   and   efficiency.   However,   the   use   of   any   traffic   pattern,   service,   or   procedure   does   not   diminish   the   pilot’s   responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft from ramp-out to ramp-in.  

When operating at an airport with an operating control tower, the pilot receives a clearance to approach or depart, as well as pertinent  information about the traffic pattern by radio. The tower operator can instruct pilots to enter the traffic pattern at any point or to make  a straight-in approach without flying the usual rectangular pattern. Many other deviations are possible if the tower operator and the  pilot work together in an effort to keep traffic moving smoothly. Jets or heavy airplanes will frequently fly wider and/or higher  patterns than lighter airplanes, and will sometimes make a straight-in approach for landing.  

A pilot is not expected to have extensive knowledge of all traffic patterns at all airports, but if the pilot is familiar with the basic  rectangular pattern, it is easy to make proper approaches and departures from most airports, regardless of whether or not they have  control towers.   However,    there is   not a control tower,   it is   the pilot’s   responsibility   to   determine the direction   of   the   traffic pattern,  to comply with appropriate traffic rules, and to display common courtesy toward other pilots operating in the area. When operating at  airports without a control tower, the pilot may not see all traffic. Therefore, the pilot should develop the habit of continued scanning  even when air traffic appears light or nil. Adherence to the basic rectangular traffic pattern reduces the possibility of conflicts and  reduces the probability of a midair collision.  

# Standard Airport Traffic Patterns  

An airport traffic pattern includes the direction and altitude of the pattern and procedures for entering and leaving the pattern. Unless  the airport displays approved visual markings indicating that turns should be made to the right, the pilot should make all turns in the  pattern to the left.  

Figure 8-1  shows a standard rectangular traffic pattern. The traffic pattern altitude is usually 1,000 feet above the elevation of the  airport surface. The use of a common altitude at a given airport is the key factor in minimizing the risk of collisions at airports  without operating control towers.  

Aircraft speeds are restrained by 14 CFR part 91, section 91.117. When operating in the traffic pattern at most airports with an  operating control tower, aircraft typically fly at airspeeds no greater than 200 knots (230 miles per hour (mph)). Sensible practice  suggests flying at or below these speeds when operating in the traffic pattern of an airport without an operating control tower. In any  case, the pilot should adjust the airspeed, when necessary, so that it is compatible with the airspeed of other aircraft in the traffic  pattern.  

![](images/03314f2b542a224d9fc38d89e7a738bba163b8e23eae4d65f93d16c1a852992e.jpg)  
Figure 8-1.  Traffic Patterns  

When entering the traffic pattern at an airport without an operating control tower, inbound pilots are expected to observe other  aircraft already in the pattern and to conform to the traffic pattern in use. The pilot should enter the traffic pattern at a point well clear  of any other observed aircraft. If there are no other aircraft observed, the pilot should check traffic indicators and wind indicators on  the ground to determine which runway and traffic pattern direction to use.  [Figure 8-2]  Many airports have L-shaped traffic pattern  indicators displayed with a segmented circle adjacent to the runway. The short member of the L shows the direction in which traffic  pattern turns are made when using the runway parallel to the long member. The pilot should check the indicators from a distance or  altitude well above the traffic pattern in case any other aircraft are in the traffic pattern.  

![](images/53a25a217ff4c3d9424f500558a2e83ce5b774ea55b1d59838ede245446d1764.jpg)  
Figure 8-2.  Traffic pattern indicators.  

Consider the following points when arriving at an airport for landing:  

⦁  T he pilot should be aware of the appropriate traffic pattern altitude before entering the pattern and remain      clear of the traffic flow until established on the entry leg.  

⦁  The traffic pattern is normally entered at a   $45^{\circ}$   angle to the downwind leg, headed toward a point abeam the      midpoint of the runway to be used for landing.  

⦁  The pilot should ensure that the entry leg is of sufficient length to provide a clear view of the entire traffic      pattern and to allow adequate time for planning the intended path in the pattern and the landing approach.  

⦁  Entries into traffic patterns while descending create specific collision hazards and should be avoided.  

The downwind leg is a course flown parallel to the landing runway, but in a direction opposite to the intended landing direction. This  leg is flown approximately   $1/2$   to 1 mile out from the landing runway and at the specified traffic pattern altitude. When flying on the  downwind leg, the pilot should complete all before-landing checks and extend the landing gear if the airplane is equipped with  retractable landing gear. Pattern altitude is maintained until at least abeam the approach end of the landing runway. At this point, the  pilot should reduce power and begin a descent. The pilot should continue the downwind leg past a point abeam the approach end of  the runway to a point approximately   $45^{\circ}$   from the approach end of the runway, and make a medium-bank turn onto the base leg. Pilots  should consider tailwinds and not descend too much on the downwind in order to have sufficient altitude to continue the descent on  the base leg.  

The base leg is the transitional part of the traffic pattern between the downwind leg and the final approach leg. Depending on the  wind condition, the pilot should establish the base leg at a sufficient distance from the approach end of the landing runway to permit a  gradual descent to the intended touchdown point. While on the base leg, the ground track of the airplane is perpendicular to the  extended centerline of the landing runway, although the longitudinal axis of the airplane may not be aligned with the ground track if  turned into the wind to counteract drift.  

While on the base leg and before turning onto the final approach, the pilot should ensure that there is no close proximity to another  aircraft already established on final approach. When two or more aircraft are approaching an airport for the purpose of landing, the  aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way. However, pilots should not take advantage of this rule to cut in front of another  aircraft that is on final approach to land or to overtake that aircraft. If the turn to final would create a collision hazard, a go-around or  avoidance maneuver is in order. A pilot trying to overtake another aircraft might be tempted to make an overly steep turn to final. If  rushing the turn to increase the distance from another aircraft, there is good reason to abandon the approach and go around.  

The final approach leg is a descending flightpath starting from the completion of the base-to-final turn and extending to the point of  touchdown. This is probably the most important leg of the entire pattern, because of the sound judgment and precision needed to  accurately control the airspeed and descent angle while approaching the intended touchdown point.  

The pilot on final approach focuses on making a safe approach. If there is traffic on the runway, there should be sufficient time for  that traffic to clear. If it appears that there may be a conflict, an early go-around may be in order. A pilot may go around and inform  the controller. This is also a good time to verify the correct landing surface and avoid lining up with the wrong runway, an airport  road, or a taxiway.  

The upwind leg is a course flown parallel to the landing runway in the same direction as landing traffic. The upwind leg is flown at  controlled airports and after go-arounds. When necessary, the upwind leg is the part of the traffic pattern in which the pilot will  transition from the final approach to the climb altitude to initiate a go-around. When a safe altitude is attained, the pilot should  commence a shallow-bank turn to the upwind side of the airport. This allows better visibility of the runway for departing aircraft.  

The departure leg of the rectangular pattern is a straight course aligned with, and leading from, the takeoff runway. This leg begins at  the point the airplane leaves the ground and continues until the pilot begins the   $90^{\circ}$   turn onto the crosswind leg.  

On the departure leg after takeoff, the pilot should continue climbing straight ahead and, if remaining in the traffic pattern, commence  a turn to the crosswind leg beyond the departure end of the runway within 300 feet of the traffic pattern altitude. If departing the  traffic pattern, the pilot should continue straight out or exit with a  $45^{\circ}$   turn (to the left when in a left-hand traffic pattern or to the right  when in a right-hand traffic pattern) beyond the departure end of the runway after reaching the traffic pattern altitude.  

The crosswind leg is the part of the rectangular pattern that is horizontally perpendicular to the extended centerline of the takeoff  runway. The pilot should enter the crosswind leg by making approximately a  $90^{\circ}$   turn from the upwind leg. The pilot should continue  on the crosswind leg, to the downwind leg position.  

If   the takeoff    made into   the wind,   the wind   will now   be approximately   perpendicular   to   the airplane’s   flightpath.   As   a result, the  pilot should turn or head the airplane slightly into the wind while on the crosswind leg to maintain a ground track that is perpendicular  to the runway centerline extension.  

# Non-Towered Airports  

Non-towered airports traffic patterns are always entered at pattern altitude. How a pilot enters the pattern depends upon the direction  of arrival. The preferred method for entering from the downwind leg side of the pattern is to approach the pattern on a course   $45^{\circ}$   to  the downwind leg and join the pattern at midfield.  

There are several ways to enter the pattern if the arrival occurs on the upwind leg side of the airport. One method of entry from the  opposite side of the pattern is to announce intentions and cross over midfield at least 500 feet above pattern altitude (normally 1,500  feet AGL). However, if large or turbine aircraft operate at the airport, it is best to remain 2,000 feet AGL so as not to conflict with  their traffic pattern. When well clear of the pattern—approximately 2 miles—the pilot should scan carefully for traffic, descend to  pattern altitude, then turn right to enter at   $45^{\circ}$   to   the downwind   leg   at midfield.   [Figure   $8–3A J$  An alternate method is to enter on a  midfield crosswind at pattern altitude, carefully scan for traffic, announce intentions, and then turn downwind.  [Figure 8-3B]  This  technique should not be used if the pattern is busy.  

![](images/8b9123b7ae0d0b4240b659f8602e9b1348d2e08e5fcc77f0a3bad5c2f403b63f.jpg)  
Figure 8-3.  Preferred  entry from upwind leg side of airport (A). Alternate midfield entry from upwind leg side of airport (B).  

In either case, it is vital to announce intentions and to scan outside. Make course and speed adjustments that will lead to a successful  pattern entry and give way to other aircraft on the preferred   $45^{\circ}$   entry or to aircraft already established on downwind.  

Why    it advantageous   to   use the preferred    $45^{\circ}$   entry?    it is   not possible to   enter   the pattern   due to   conflicting   traffic,   the pilot on a   $45^{\circ}$   entry   can   continue to   turn   away   from   the downwind,   fly   a safe distance   away,   and   return   for   another   attempt to   join   on   the   $45^{\circ}$    entry—all while scanning for traffic.  

Before joining the downwind leg, adjust course or speed to fit the traffic. Once fitting into the flow of traffic, adjust power on the  downwind leg to avoid flying too fast or too slow. Speeds recommended by the airplane manufacturer should be used. They will  generally fall between 70 to 90 knots for typical piston single-engine airplanes.  

# Safety Considerations  

According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the most probable cause of mid-air collisions is the pilot failing to  see and avoid other aircraft. When near an airport, pilots should continue to scan for other aircraft and check blind spots caused by  fixed aircraft structures, such as doorposts and wings. High-wing airplanes have restricted visibility above while low-wing airplanes  have limited visibility below. The worst-case scenario is a low-wing airplane flying above a high-wing airplane. Banking from time to  time can uncover blind spots. The pilot should also occasionally look to the rear of the airplane to check for other aircraft.  Figure 8-4  depicts the greatest threat area for mid-air collisions in the traffic pattern. Listed below are important facts regarding mid-air  collisions:  

⦁  Mid-air collisions generally occur during daylight hours — 56 percent occur in the afternoon, 32 percent      occur in the morning, and 2 percent occur at night, dusk, or dawn.  

⦁  Most mid-air collisions occur under good visibility.  

⦁  A mid-air collision is most likely to occur between two aircraft going in the same direction.  

⦁  The majority of pilots involved in mid-air collisions are not on a flight plan.  

⦁  Nearly all accidents occur at or near uncontrolled airports and at altitudes below 1,000 feet.  

⦁  Pilots of all experience levels can be involved in mid-air collisions

Figure 8-4.  Location distribution of mid-air collisions in the airport traffic pattern.  

The following are some important procedures that all pilots should follow when flying in a traffic pattern or in the vicinity of an  airport.  

1. Tune and verify radio frequencies before entering the airport traffic area.  2. Monitor the correct Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF).  3. Report position 10 miles out and listen for reports from other inbound traffic.  4. At a non-towered airport, report entering downwind, turning downwind to base, and base to final.  5. Descend to traffic pattern altitude before entering the pattern.  6. Maintain a constant visual scan for other aircraft.  7. Be aware that there may be aircraft in the pattern without radios.  8. Use exterior lights to improve the chances of being seen.  

# Chapter Summary  

The volume of traffic at an airport can create a hazardous environment. Airport traffic patterns are procedures that improve the flow  of traffic at an airport and enhance safety when properly executed. Most reported mid-air collisions occur during the final or short- final approach leg of the airport traffic pattern.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 9: Approaches and Landings  

# Introduction  

There is an old saying that while takeoff is optional, landing is mandatory. In consideration of that adage, this chapter focuses on the  approach to landing, factors that affect landings, types of landings, and aspects of faulty landings. A careful pilot knows that the safe  outcome of a landing should never be in doubt. Pilots who respect their own limitations are able to approach each landing with confidence  and achieve the satisfaction that comes from successful aircraft control. After any landing, a pilot performs a self-evaluation. If there is  a question, a read of the relevant section in this chapter may help. When needed, additional flight instruction enhances safety.  

The manufacturer’s recommended procedures, including airplane configuration and airspeeds, and other information relevant to  approaches and landings in a specific make and model airplane are contained in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved  Airplane Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) for that airplane. If any of the information in this chapter differs  from the airplane manufacturer’s recommendations as contained in the AFM/POH, the airplane manufacturer’s recommendations take  precedence.  

# Use of Flaps  

The following general discussion applies to airplanes equipped with flaps. The pilot may use landing flaps during the descent to adjust  lift and drag. Flap settings help determine the landing spot and the descent angle to that spot. [ Figure 9-1  and  Figure 9-2 ] Flap extension  during approaches and landings provides several advantages by:  

1. Producing greater lift and permitting lower approach and landing speeds,  

2. Producing greater drag and permitting a steeper descent angle,  

3. Increasing forward visibility by allowing a lower pitch, and  

4. Reducing the length of the landing roll.  

![](images/f63bb27bcf3b7bbdd9567519ea05a308f48e9e70cf2e8bf216e503c9a2bb1e2b.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.  Effect of flaps on the landing point.  

![](images/4893302009e8863ae633c167ccf105f6cf02f77ef62dec6de3cf9e059b5d5638.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.  Effect of flaps on the approach angle.  

The increased camber from flap deflection increases lift, primarily on the rear portion of the wing. This produces a nose-down pitching  moment which may cause the airplane to pitch down. Flap deployment may also affect wing downwash on the horizontal tail and alter  the tail-down force. Consequently, pitch behavior from flap extension depends on the design of the particular airplane.  

Flap deflection of up to   $15^{\circ}$   primarily produces lift with minimal drag. The airplane has a tendency to balloon up with initial flap  deflection because of the lift increase. The nose-down pitching moment, however, tends to offset the balloon. Flap deflection beyond   $15^{\circ}$   produces a large increase in drag. Deflection beyond   $15^{\circ}$   also produces a significant nose-up pitching moment in certain high-wing  airplanes because the resulting downwash changes the airflow over the horizontal tail.  

The time of flap extension and the degree of deflection are related. Large changes in flap deflection at one single point in the landing  pattern can produce large lift changes that require significant pitch and power changes in order to maintain airspeed and descent angle.  Consequently, there is an advantage to extending flaps in increments while in the landing pattern. Incremental deflection of flaps on  downwind, base leg, and final approach allow smaller adjustments of pitch and power and support a stabilized approach.  

Whenever the flap setting is changed, the pilot should be prepared to re-trim the airplane as needed to compensate for the change in  aerodynamic forces.  Throughout this chapter, more detail is provided on the use of flaps during specific approach and landing situations,  as appropriate.  

# Normal Approach and Landing  

Normal approach and landing procedures are used when the engine power is available, the wind is light or the final approach is made  directly into the wind, the final approach path has no obstacles, and the landing surface is firm and of ample length to gradually bring the  airplane to a stop. The selected landing point is normally beyond the runway approach threshold but within the first 1⁄3 of the runway.  

The factors involved and the procedures described for the normal approach and landing also have applications to the other-than-normal  approaches and landings discussed later in this chapter. The principles of normal operations are explained first and need to be understood  before proceeding to the more complex operations. To better understand the factors that influence judgment and procedures, the last part  of the approach pattern and the actual landing are divided into five phases:  

1. the base leg  2. the final approach  3. the round out (flare)  4. the touchdown  5. the after-landing roll  

# Base Leg  

The placement of the base leg is one of the important judgments made by the pilot to set up for a good landing. [ Figure 9-3 ] The pilot  accurately judges the height, distance from the approach end of the  runway, and rate of descent to allow a stabilized approach, round  out, and touchdown at the desired spot. The distance depends on the altitude of the base leg, the current winds, and the amount of wing  flaps used. When there is a strong wind on final approach or the flaps are used to produce a steep angle of descent, the base leg should  be positioned closer to the approach end of the runway than would be required with normal winds or flap settings. Normally, the landing  gear is extended and the before-landing check completed prior to reaching the base leg.  

After turning onto the base leg, the pilot starts or continues the descent with reduced power and a target airspeed of approximately 1.4   $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  —the stalling speed in the landing configuration. For example, if  $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$   is 60 knots,   $1.4\;\mathrm{V_{SO}}$   is 84 knots   $(84=1.4\:\mathrm{x}\:60)$  ). Landing flaps  should be deployed as recommended. Full flaps are not recommended until the final approach is established. Since the final approach  and landing are normally made into the wind, there is usually a crosswind during the base leg. A drift correction is established and  maintained to follow a ground track perpendicular to the extension of the landing runway centerline. This requires that the airplane be  angled sufficiently into the wind to prevent drifting farther away from the intended landing spot.  

![](images/e2356f33fce1c2bb8e69df85f63fe2a7da46cc7cb89c73169b58b97f5b00ed76.jpg)  
Figure 9-3.  Base leg and final approach.  

# Final Approach  

After the base-to-final approach turn is completed, the pilot aligns the longitudinal axis of the airplane with the centerline of the runway  or landing surface. On a final approach, with no crosswind, the longitudinal axis is kept aligned with the runway centerline throughout  the final approach and landing. (Methods to correct for a crosswind are explained in the “Crosswind Approach and Landing” section of  this chapter. For now, only approaches and landings where the wind is straight down the runway are discussed.)  

After aligning the airplane with the runway centerline, the final flap setting is completed and the pitch attitude adjusted as required. Some  adjustment of pitch and power may be necessary to maintain the desired rate of descent and approach airspeed. The pilot should use  the manufacturer's recommended airspeed or   $1.3~\mathrm{V_{SO}}$   if there is no manufacturer's recommendation. As the pitch attitude and airspeed  stabilize, the airplane is re-trimmed to relieve any control pressure.  

The descent angle is controlled throughout the approach so that the airplane lands in the center of the first third of the runway. The descent  angle is affected by all four fundamental forces that act on an airplane (lift, drag, thrust, and weight). If all the forces are balanced out  such that the net force on the airplane is zero, the descent angle remains constant in a steady state wind condition. The pilot controls these  forces by adjusting the airspeed, attitude, power, and drag (flaps or forward slip). However, wind may affect the gliding distance over  the ground [ Figure 9-4 ]; the pilot does not have control over the wind, but corrects for its effect on the airplane’s descent by adjusting  pitch and power appropriately.  

![](images/8f908e0eb4acab25096eb89480e9ca1daea4c8ba7ceb73a496a55fb0a3ea5a70.jpg)  
Figure 9-4.  Effect of headwind on final approach.  

A well-executed final approach includes reaching the desired touchdown point at an airspeed that results in minimum floating just  before touchdown. To accomplish this, both the descent angle and the airspeed need to be controlled. This is one reason for performing  approaches with partial power; if the approach is too high, the pilot can lower the nose and reduce the power to maintain the correct  airspeed. When the approach is too low, the pilot can add power and raise the nose.  

While the proper angle of descent and airspeed are maintained by integrating pitch and power changes, an untrained or inexperienced  pilot may try to reach a landing spot by applying back-elevator pressure without adding power. However, attempting to stretch the final  approach by raising the pitch attitude alone is almost always a bad idea. Using pitch alone causes a significant increase in AOA and decay  in airspeed that leads to an excessive rate of descent or a low altitude stall. It is possible for either or both to occur.  

# Wrong Surface Landing Avoidance  

A wrong surface landing occurs when an aircraft lands or tries to land on the wrong runway, on a taxiway in error, or at the wrong airport.  The pilot should take a moment on every final approach to verify the correctness of the landing zone ahead.  

Lack of familiarity with a particular airport, complacency, or fatigue may lead to pilot confusion, and occasionally a pilot will line up  with the wrong surface while perceiving the situation as normal. A pilot may compensate for any lack of destination airport familiarity  by studying an airport diagram and lighting ahead of time and noting key features and geometry. On final approach, the pilot should  verify correct runway alignment and runway number. Pilots often refer to moving map displays driven by GPS, and these devices should  increase situational awareness and safety. If there is a doubt over the landing surface, the pilot should go around and consider the situation  further.  

# Stabilized Approach Concept  

A stabilized approach is one in which the pilot establishes and maintains a constant-angle glide path towards a predetermined point on the  landing runway. It is based on the pilot’s judgment of certain visual clues and depends on maintaining a constant final descent airspeed  and configuration.  

An airplane descending on final approach at a constant rate and airspeed travels in a straight line towards a spot on the ground ahead,  commonly called the aiming point. If the airplane maintains a constant glide path without a round out for landing, it will strike the ground  at the aiming point. [ Figure 9-5 ]  

![](images/82b62f1f9d055962a4fe33e1c2e48e1d0c1aad3748252cd6614a7c1468a922cb.jpg)  
Figure 9-5.  Stabilized approach.  

To the pilot, the aiming point appears to be stationary. It does not appear to move under the nose of the aircraft and does not appear to  move forward away from the aircraft. This feature identifies the aiming point—it does not move. However, objects in front of and beyond  the aiming point do appear to move as the distance is closed, and they appear to move in opposite directions! For a constant angle glide  path, the distance between the horizon and the aiming point remains constant. If descending at a constant angle and the distance between  the perceived aiming point and the horizon appears to increase (aiming point moving down away from the horizon), then the true aiming  point is farther down the runway. If the distance between the perceived aiming point and the horizon decreases, meaning that the aiming  point is moving up toward the horizon, the true aiming point is closer than perceived.  

During instruction in landings, one of the important skills a pilot acquires is how to use visual cues to discern the true aiming point from  any distance out on final approach. From this, the pilot determines if the current glide path will result in either an under or overshoot.  Note that the aiming point is not where the airplane actually touches down. Since the pilot reduces the rate of descent during the round  out (flare), the actual touchdown occurs farther down the runway. Considering float during round out, the pilot is also able to predict the  point of touchdown with some accuracy.  

When the airplane is established on final approach, the shape of the runway image also presents clues as to what should be done to  maintain a stabilized approach to a safe landing.  

Obviously, a runway is normally shaped in the form of an elongated rectangle. When viewed from the air during the approach, the  phenomenon, known as perspective, causes the runway to assume the shape of a trapezoid with the far end looking narrower than the  approach end and the edge lines converging ahead.  

As an airplane continues down the glide path at a constant angle (stabilized), the image the pilot sees is still trapezoidal, but of  proportionately larger dimensions. In other words, during a stabilized approach, the runway shape does not change. [ Figure 9-6 ]  

![](images/159977232299c3db1cf059f1236cca8ad16671bc0d4f556853fe4f2df490118f.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.  Runway shape during stabilized approach.  

If the approach becomes shallow, the runway appears to shorten and become wider. Conversely, if the approach is steepened, the runway  appears to become longer and narrower. [ Figure 9-7 ]

Figure 9-7.  Change in runway shape if approach becomes narrow or steep.  

Immediately after rolling out on final approach, the pilot adjusts the pitch attitude, power, and trim so that the airplane is descending  directly toward the aiming point at the appropriate airspeed in the landing configuration. If it appears that the airplane is going to  overshoot the desired landing spot, a steeper approach results by reducing power and lowering the pitch attitude to maintain airspeed.  If available and not fully extended, the pilot may further extend the flaps. If the desired landing spot is being undershot and a shallower  approach is needed, the pilot increases both power and pitch attitude to reduce the descent angle. Once the approach is set up and control  pressures removed with trim, the pilot is free to devote significant attention toward outside references and use the available visual cues  to fine tune the approach. The pilot should not stare at any one place, but rather scan from one point to another, such as from the aiming  point to the horizon, to any objects along the runway, to an area well short of the runway, and back to the aiming point. This makes it  easier to perceive any deviation from the desired glide path and determine if the airplane is proceeding directly toward the aiming point.  The pilot should also glance at the airspeed indicator periodically and correct for any airspeed deviation.  

Pilots normally establish a stabilized approach before short final. The round out, touchdown, and landing roll are much easier to  accomplish when preceded by a stabilized final approach, which reduces the chance of a landing mishap. Therefore, deviations from the  desired glide path should be detected and corrected early so that the magnitude of corrections during the later portion of the approach is  small. If the approach is very high or very low, it may not be possible to establish a stabilized approach, and the pilot normally executes a  go-around. If the airplane is initially low and undershooting the aiming point, the pilot may intercept the desired glide path by increasing  pitch attitude and adding power to level off while maintaining the correct airspeed. This may necessitate a substantial increase in power  if the aircraft is operating on the backside of the power curve. As the airplane intercepts the desired glide path, the pilot reduces power  and pitches down to remain on the glide path. Retracting the flaps to correct for an undershoot creates an unnecessary risk. It may cause  a sudden decrease in lift, an excessive sink rate, and an aggravated unstable condition.  

If the approach is too high or too low, it may not be possible to establish a stabilized approach, and the pilot should execute a go- around. Typically, pilots go-around if unable to establish a stabilized approach by 500 ft above airport elevation in visual meteorological  conditions (VMC) or 1,000 ft above airport elevation in instrument conditions (IMC). For a typical GA piston aircraft in a traffic pattern,  an immediate go-around should be initiated if the approach becomes unstabilized below 300 ft AGL.  

Pilots may consider the following elements when attempting to set up and fly a stabilized approach to landing. The pilot should focus  on the elements that lead to a stabilized approach rather than the order of the elements or the insistence on meeting all of the approach  criteria. For a typical piston aircraft, an approach is stabilized when the following criteria are met:  

1.  Glide path.  Typically a constant 3 degrees to the touchdown zone on the runway (obstructions permitting).  

2. Heading.  The aircraft tracks the centerline to the runway with only minor heading/pitch changes necessary to correct for wind  or turbulence to maintain alignment. Bank angle normally limited to 15 degrees once established on final.  3.  Airspeed.  The aircraft speed is within   $+10$   /-5 KIAS of the recommended landing speed specified in the AFM,   $1.3\mathrm{V_{so}},$  , or on  approved placards/markings. If the pilot applies a gust factor, indicated airspeed should not decay below the recommended  landing speed.  4.  Configuration.  The aircraft is in the correct landing configuration with flaps as required; landing gear extended, and is in trim.  5.  Descent rate.  A descent rate (generally 500-1000 fpm for light general aviation aircraft) makes for a safe approach. Minimal  adjustments to the descent rate as the airplane approaches the runway provide an additional indication of a stabilized and safe  approach. If using a descent rate in excess of 500 fpm due to approach considerations, the pilot should reduce the descent rate  prior to 300 ft AGL.  6.  Power setting.  The pilot should use a power setting appropriate for the aircraft configuration and not below the minimum  power for approach as defined by the AFM.  7. Briefings and checklists.  Completing all briefings and checklists prior to initiating the approach (except the landing checklist),  ensures the pilot can focus on the elements listed above.  

# Estimating Airplane Movement and Height  

During short final, round out, and touchdown, vision is of prime importance. To provide a wide scope of vision and to foster good  judgment of height and movement, the pilot’s head should assume a natural, straight-ahead position. Visual focus is not fixed on any  one side or any one spot ahead of the airplane. Instead, it is changed slowly from a point just over the airplane’s nose to the desired  touchdown zone and back again. This is done while maintaining a deliberate awareness of distance from either side of the runway using  peripheral vision.  

Accurate estimation of distance, besides being a matter of practice, depends upon how clearly objects are seen. It requires that vision be  focused properly so that the important objects stand out as clearly as possible.  

Speed blurs objects at close range. For example, most everyone has noted this in an automobile moving at high speed. Nearby objects  seem to merge together in a blur, while objects farther away stand out clearly. The driver subconsciously focuses the eyes sufficiently  far ahead of the automobile to see objects distinctly.  

The distance at which the pilot’s vision is focused should be proportional to the speed at which the airplane is traveling over the ground.  Thus, as speed is reduced during the round out, the distance ahead of the airplane at which it is possible to focus is brought closer  accordingly.  

If the pilot attempts to focus on a reference that is too close or looks directly down, the reference becomes blurred, [ Figure 9-8 ] and the  reaction is either too abrupt or too late. In this case, the pilot’s tendency is to over-control, round out high, and make full-stall, drop-in  landings. If the pilot focuses too far ahead, accuracy in judging the closeness of the ground is lost and the consequent reaction is too slow,  since there does not appear to be a necessity for action. This sometimes results in the airplane flying into the ground nose first. The change  of visual focus from a long distance to a short distance requires a definite time interval, and even though the time is brief, the airplane’s  speed during this interval is such that the airplane travels an appreciable distance, both forward and downward toward the ground.  

![](images/6ab901e3fe91e895966817529df877836fe5e802c88066dd30f13676afb1cf8a.jpg)  
Figure 9-8.  Focusing too close blurs vision.  

Visual cues are important in flaring at the proper height and maintaining the wheels a few inches above the runway until eventual  touchdown. Flare cues are primarily dependent on the angle at which the pilot’s central vision intersects the ground (or runway) ahead  and slightly to the side. Proper depth perception is a factor in a successful flare, but the visual cues used most are those related to changes  in runway or terrain perspective and to changes in the size and texture of familiar objects near the landing area. The pilot should focus  direct central vision at a shallow downward angle from   $10^{\circ}$   to   $15^{\circ}$   relative to the runway as the round out/flare is initiated. [ Figure 9-9 ]  When using this steady viewing angle, the point of visual interception with the runway appears progressively closer as the airplane  loses altitude. This rate of closure is an important visual cue in assessing the rate of altitude loss. Conversely, movement of the visual  interception point further down the runway indicates an increase in altitude and means that the pitch angle was increased too rapidly  during the flare. Location of the visual interception point in conjunction with assessment of flow velocity of nearby off-runway terrain,  as well as the similarity of appearance of height above the runway ahead of the airplane (in comparison to the way it looked when the  airplane was taxied prior to takeoff), is also used to judge when the wheels are just a few inches above the runway.  

![](images/3c0d2ddd1f88120eb7195fef772a6f4043857548419f6cba0f2514b6536ecd75.jpg)  
Figure 9-9.  To obtain necessary visual cues, the pilot should look toward the runway at a shallow angle.  

# Round Out (Flare)  

The round out is a slow, smooth transition from a normal approach attitude to a landing attitude, gradually rounding out the flightpath  to one that is parallel to and a few inches above the runway. When the airplane approaches 10 to 20 feet above the ground in a normal  descent, the round out or flare is started. Back-elevator pressure is gradually applied to slowly increase the pitch attitude and AOA.  [ Figure 9-10 ] The AOA is increased at a rate that allows the airplane to continue settling slowly as forward speed decreases. This is a  continuous process until the airplane touches down on the ground.  

![](images/3955eee296e27b66e7f6a8f3fcfaff8d1f0d3bfa93ed328cec1dcb615a459d65.jpg)  
Figure 9-10.  Changing angle of attack during round out.  

When the AOA is increased, the lift is momentarily increased and this decreases the rate of descent. Since power normally is reduced  to idle during the round out, the airspeed also gradually decreases. This causes lift to decrease again and necessitates raising the nose  and further increasing the AOA. During the round out, the airspeed is decreased to touchdown speed while the lift is controlled so the  airplane settles gently onto the landing surface. The round out is executed at a rate such that the proper landing attitude and the proper  touchdown airspeed are attained simultaneously just as the wheels contact the landing surface.  

The rate at which the round out is executed depends on the airplane’s height above the ground, the rate of descent, and the pitch attitude.  A round out started excessively high needs to be executed more slowly than one started from a lower height. The round out rate should  also be proportional to the rate of closure with the ground. When the airplane appears to be descending very slowly, the increase in pitch  attitude should be made at a correspondingly slow rate.  

The pitch attitude of the airplane in a full-flap approach is considerably lower than in a no-flap approach. To attain the proper landing  attitude before touching down, the nose needs to travel through a greater pitch change when flaps are fully extended. Since the round  out is usually started at approximately the same height above the ground regardless of the degree of flaps used, the pitch attitude should  be increased at a faster rate when full flaps are used. However, the round out should still be executed at a rate that takes the airplane’s  downward motion into account.  

Once the actual process of rounding out is started, the pilot should not push the elevator control forward. If too much back-elevator  pressure was exerted, this pressure is either slightly relaxed or held constant, depending on the degree of the error. In some cases, it may  be necessary to advance the throttle slightly to prevent an excessive rate of sink or a stall, either of which results in a hard, drop-in type  landing.  

It is recommended that a pilot form the habit of keeping one hand on the throttle throughout the approach and landing should a sudden  and unexpected hazardous situation require an immediate application of power.  

# Touchdown  

The touchdown is the gentle settling of the airplane onto the landing surface. The round out and touchdown are normally made with  the engine idling. During the round out, the airspeed decays such that the airplane touches down on the main gear at or just above the  approximate stalling speed. As the airplane settles, proper landing attitude is attained by application of whatever back-elevator pressure  is necessary.  

Some pilots try to force or fly the airplane onto the ground without establishing proper landing attitude. The airplane should never be  flown onto the runway with excessive speed. A common technique to making a smooth touchdown is to actually focus on holding the  wheels of the aircraft a few inches off the ground as long as possible using the elevators while the power is smoothly reduced to idle. In  most cases, when the wheels are within 2 or 3 feet of the ground, the airplane is still settling too fast for a gentle touchdown. Therefore,  this descent is retarded by increasing back-elevator pressure. Since the airplane is already close to its stalling speed and is settling, this  added back-elevator pressure only slows the settling instead of stopping it. At the same time, it results in the airplane touching the ground  in the proper landing attitude and the main wheels touching down first so that little or no weight is on the nose-wheel. [ Figure 9-11 ]  

![](images/cb8162b24da45cd61242a89827ef2a23f98dc132034c5952ad978948ba2055c2.jpg)  
Figure 9-11.  A well-executed round out results in attaining the proper landing attitude.  

After the main wheels make initial contact with the ground, back-elevator pressure is held to maintain a positive AOA for aerodynamic  braking and to hold the nose-wheel off the ground as the airplane decelerates. The pilot should be certain not to inadvertently have brake  pressure engaged as touchdown occurs. Early use of brakes can result in a sudden drop in the nose and a loss of aerodynamic braking. As  the airplane’s momentum decreases, back-elevator pressure is gradually relaxed to allow the nose-wheel to gently settle onto the runway.  This permits steering if the airplane has a steerable nose-wheel. At the same time, it decreases the AOA and reduces lift on the wings to  prevent floating or skipping and allows the full weight of the airplane to rest on the wheels for better mechanical braking action. As the  airplane slows, the mechanical braking becomes more effective.  

It is extremely important that the touchdown occur with the airplane’s longitudinal axis exactly parallel to the direction in which the  airplane is moving along the runway. Failure to accomplish this imposes severe side loads on the landing gear. To avoid these side  stresses, the pilot should not allow the airplane to touch down while turned into the wind or drifting.  

# After-Landing Roll  

The landing process should never be considered complete until the airplane decelerates to the normal taxi speed during the landing roll or  has been brought to a complete stop when clear of the landing area. Accidents may occur as a result of pilots abandoning their vigilance  and failing to maintain positive control after getting the airplane on the ground.  

A pilot should be alert for directional control difficulties immediately upon and after touchdown due to the ground friction on the wheels.  Loss of directional control may lead to an aggravated, uncontrolled, tight turn on the ground, or a ground loop. The combination of  centrifugal force acting on the center of gravity (CG) and ground friction of the main wheels resisting it during the ground loop may  cause the airplane to tip or lean enough for the outside wingtip to contact the ground. This imposes a sideward force that could collapse  the landing gear.  

The rudder serves the same purpose on the ground as it does in the air—it controls the yawing of the airplane. The effectiveness of the  rudder is dependent on the airflow, which depends on the speed of the airplane. As the speed decreases and the nose-wheel has been  lowered to the ground, the steerable nose provides more positive directional control.  

The brakes of an airplane serve the same primary purpose as the brakes of an automobile—to reduce speed on the ground. In airplanes,  they are also used as an aid in directional control when more positive control is required than could be obtained with rudder or nose- wheel steering alone.  

To use brakes, on an airplane equipped with toe brakes, the pilot slides the toes or feet up from the rudder pedals to the brake pedals. If  rudder pressure is being held at the time braking action is needed, the pilot should not release that pressure as the feet or toes are being  slid up to the brake pedals because control may be lost before brakes can be applied.  

Putting maximum weight on the wheels after touchdown is an important factor in obtaining optimum braking performance. During  the early part of rollout, some lift continues to be generated by the wing. After touchdown, the nose-wheel is lowered to the runway  to maintain directional control. During deceleration, applying brakes may cause the nose to pitch down and some weight to transfer to  the nose-wheel from the main wheels. This does not aid in braking action, so back pressure is applied to the controls without lifting the  nose-wheel off the runway. This enables directional control while keeping weight on the main wheels.  

Careful application of the brakes is initiated after the nose-wheel is on the ground and directional control is established. Maximum brake  effectiveness is just short of the point where skidding occurs. If the brakes are applied so hard that skidding takes place, braking becomes  ineffective. Skidding is stopped by releasing the brake pressure. Braking effectiveness is not enhanced by alternately applying, releasing,  and reapplying brake pressure. The brakes are applied firmly and smoothly as necessary.  

During the ground roll, the airplane’s direction of movement can be changed by carefully applying pressure on one brake or uneven  pressures on each brake in the desired direction. Caution must be exercised when applying brakes to avoid over-controlling.  

The ailerons serve the same purpose on the ground as they do in the air—they change the lift and drag components of the wings. During  the after-landing roll, they are used to keep the wings level in much the same way they are used in flight. If a wing starts to rise, aileron  control is applied toward that wing to lower it. The amount required depends on speed because as the forward speed of the airplane  decreases, the ailerons become less effective. Procedures for using ailerons in crosswind conditions are explained in the “Crosswind  Approach and Landing” section of this chapter.  

Once the airplane has slowed sufficiently and has turned onto the taxiway and stopped, the pilot performs the after-landing checklist.  Many accidents have occurred as a result of the pilot unintentionally operating the landing gear control and retracting the gear instead  of the flap control when the airplane was still rolling. The habit of positively identifying both of these controls, before actuating them,  should be formed from the very beginning of flight training and continued in all future flying activities. If available runway permits, the  speed of the airplane is allowed to dissipate in a normal manner.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of normal approaches and landings are:  1. Failure to complete the landing checklist in a timely manner.  2. Inadequate wind drift correction on the base leg.  3. An overshooting, undershooting, too steep, or too shallow a turn onto final approach.  4. A skidding turn from base leg to final approach as a result of overshooting/inadequate wind drift correction.  5. Poor coordination during turn from base to final approach.  6. Unstable approach.  7. Failure to adequately compensate for flap extension.  8. Poor trim technique on final approach.  9. Attempting to maintain altitude or reach the runway using elevator alone.  10. Focusing too close to the airplane resulting in a too high round out.  11. Focusing too far from the airplane resulting in a too low round out.  12. Touching down prior to attaining proper landing attitude.  13. Failure to hold sufficient back-elevator pressure after touchdown.  14. Excessive braking after touchdown.  15. Loss of aircraft control during touchdown and rollout.  

# Go-Arounds (Rejected Landings)  

A go-around is a normal maneuver that is used when approach and landing parameters deviate from expectations or when it is hazardous  to continue. Situations such as air traffic control (ATC) requirements, unexpected appearance of hazards on the runway, overtaking  another airplane, wind shear, wake turbulence, mechanical failure, or an unstable approach are all reasons to discontinue a landing  approach. Like any other normal maneuver, the go-around should be practiced and perfected. The flight instructor should emphasize  early on, and the pilot should understand, that any approach or landing may result in a go-around. The assumption that an aborted landing  is invariably the consequence of a poor approach, which in turn is due to insufficient experience or skill, is a fallacy.  

Although the need to discontinue a landing may arise at any point in the landing process, the most critical go-around is one started when  very close to the ground. The go-around maneuver is not inherently dangerous in itself. It becomes dangerous only when delayed unduly  or executed improperly. Delay in initiating the go-around normally stems from two sources:  

1. Landing expectancy or set—the anticipatory belief that conditions are not as threatening as they are and that the approach is  sure to terminate with a safe landing.  2. Pride—the mistaken belief that the act of going around is an admission of failure—failure to execute the approach properly.  

The proper execution of a go-around maneuver includes three cardinal principles:  

1. Power  2. Attitude  3. Configuration  

# Power  

Power is the pilot’s first concern. The instant a pilot decides to go around, full or maximum allowable takeoff power should be applied  smoothly, without hesitation, and held until flying speed and controllability are restored. An airplane that is settling toward the ground  has inertia that needs to be overcome, and sufficient power is needed to stop the descent. The application of power is smooth, as well as  positive. Abrupt movements of the throttle in some airplanes cause the engine to falter. Carburetor heat is turned off to obtain maximum  power, as applicable.  

# Attitude  

A pilot executing a go-around needs to accept the fact that an airplane cannot fly below stall speed, and it cannot climb below minimum  power required speed. The pilot should resist any impulse to pitch-up for a climb if airspeed is insufficient. In some circumstances, it  may be desirable to lower the nose briefly to gain airspeed and not be on the backside of the power curve.  

At the time a pilot decides to go around, a trim setting for low airspeed is in place. The sudden addition of power tends to raise the  airplane’s nose and causes left yaw. Allowing the nose to rise too early could result in an unrecoverable stall when the go-around occurs  at a low altitude. The pilot should anticipate the need for considerable forward elevator pressure to hold the nose level or in a safe  climb attitude. The pilot applies sufficient right rudder pressure to counteract torque and P-factor. Trim helps to relieve adverse control  pressures and assists in maintaining a proper pitch attitude. After attaining the appropriate airspeed and adjusting pitch attitude for a  climb, the pilot should “rough trim” the airplane to relieve any adverse control pressures. More precise trim adjustments can be made  when flight conditions have stabilized. On airplanes that produce high control pressures when using maximum power on go-arounds, the  pilot should use caution when reaching for the flap handle. Airplane control is the first consideration during this high-workload phase.  

# Configuration  

After establishing the proper climb attitude and power settings, the pilot's next concern is flap retraction. After the descent has been  stopped, the landing flaps are partially retracted or placed in the takeoff position as recommended by the manufacturer. Depending on the  airplane’s altitude and airspeed, it is wise to retract the flaps intermittently in small increments to allow time for the airplane to accelerate  progressively as they are being raised. A sudden and complete retraction of the flaps could cause a loss of lift resulting in the airplane  settling into the ground. [ Figure 9-12 ]  

![](images/179875ab434f527340f68d6440fccae75ffe3706b5284738c75104a78c98ceb5.jpg)  
Figure 9-12.  Go-around procedure.  

Unless otherwise specified in the AFM/POH, it is generally recommended that the flaps be retracted (at least partially) before retracting  the landing gear for two reasons. First, on most airplanes full flaps produce more drag than the landing gear; and second, in case the  airplane inadvertently touches down as the go-around is initiated, it is desirable to have the landing gear in the down-and-locked position.  After a positive rate of climb is established, the landing gear is retracted.  

The landing gear is retracted only after the initial or rough trim is accomplished and when it is certain the airplane will remain airborne.  During the initial part of an extremely low go-around, it is possible for the airplane to settle onto the runway and bounce. This situation  is not particularly dangerous provided the airplane is kept straight and a constant, safe pitch attitude is maintained. With the application  of power, the airplane attains a safe flying speed rapidly and the advanced power cushions any secondary touchdown.  

# Ground Effect  

Ground effect is a factor in every landing and every takeoff in fixed-wing airplanes. Ground effect can also be an important factor in go­ arounds. If the go-around is made close to the ground, the airplane may be in the ground effect area. Pilots are often lulled into a sense of  false security by the apparent “cushion of air” under the wings that initially assists in the transition from an approach descent to a climb.  This “cushion of air,” however, is imaginary. The apparent increase in airplane performance is, in fact, due to a reduction in induced  drag in the ground effect area. It is “borrowed” performance that is repaid when the airplane climbs out of the ground effect area. The  pilot needs to factor in ground effect when initiating a go-around close to the ground. An attempt to climb prematurely may result in the  airplane not being able to climb or even maintain altitude at full power.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of go-arounds (rejected landings) are:  

1. Failure to recognize a condition that warrants a rejected landing.  2. Indecision.  3. Delay in initiating a go-around.  4. Failure to apply maximum allowable power in a timely manner.  5. Abrupt power application.  6. Improper pitch attitude.  7. Failure to configure the airplane appropriately.  8. Attempting to climb out of ground effect prematurely.  9. Failure to adequately compensate for torque/P factor.  10. Loss of aircraft control.  

# Intentional Slips  

A slip occurs when the bank angle of an airplane is too steep for the existing rate of turn. Unintentional slips are most often the result  of uncoordinated rudder/aileron application. Intentional slips, however, are used to dissipate altitude without increasing airspeed and/  or to adjust airplane ground track during a crosswind. Intentional slips are especially useful in forced landings and in situations where  obstacles need to be cleared during approaches to confined areas. A slip can also be used as a means of rapidly reducing airspeed in  situations where wing flaps are inoperative or not installed.  

A slip is a combination of forward movement and sideward (with respect to the longitudinal axis of the airplane) movement, the lateral  axis being inclined and the sideward movement being toward the low end of this axis (low wing). An airplane in a slip is in fact flying  sideways through the air even though it may appear to be going straight over the ground. This results in a change in the direction that  the relative wind strikes the airplane. Slips are characterized by a marked increase in drag and corresponding decrease in airplane climb,  cruise, and glide performance. Because the airplane is banked, the vertical component of lift is reduced allowing for an airplane in a slip  to descend rapidly without an increase in airspeed.  

Most airplanes exhibit the characteristic of positive static directional stability and, therefore, have a natural tendency to compensate for  slipping. An intentional slip usually requires deliberate cross-controlling of ailerons and rudder throughout the maneuver.  

There are two types of intentional slips: sideslip and forward slips. Sideslips are frequently used when landing with a crosswind to keep  the aircraft aligned with the runway centerline. A sideslip is entered by lowering a wing and applying just enough opposite rudder to  prevent a turn. In a sideslip, the airplane’s longitudinal axis remains parallel to the original flightpath, but the airplane no longer flies  straight ahead. Instead, the horizontal component of lift forces the airplane also to move somewhat sideways toward the low wing.  [ Figure 9-13 ] The amount of slip, and therefore the rate of sideward movement, is determined by the bank angle. The steeper the bank,  the greater the degree of slip. As bank angle is increased, additional opposite rudder is required to prevent turning.  

![](images/29515d99701b368381097aba84fb767e0f9bf7d424c472273f906afbbf016e02.jpg)  
Figure 9-13.  Sideslip.  

A forward slip is used to dissipate altitude and increase descent rate without increasing airspeed. In a forward slip, the airplane’s direction  of motion continues the same as before the slip was begun. Assuming the airplane is originally in straight coordinated flight, the wing on  one side is lowered by use of the ailerons. Simultaneously, sufficient opposite rudder is used to yaw the airplane’s nose in the opposite  direction such that the airplane remains on its original flightpath. However, the nose of the airplane will no longer point in the direction  of flightpath. [ Figure 9-14 ] In a forward slip, the amount of slip, and therefore the sink rate, is determined by the bank angle. The steeper  the bank, the steeper the descent. In order to use the maneuver to lose altitude, power is normally reduced to idle. The pilot controls  airspeed using elevator control. When a crosswind is present, the pilot should lower the upwind wing such that the airplane is banked  into the crosswind since slipping into the wind makes it easier to remain on the original flightpath.  

In most light airplanes, the steepness of a slip is limited by the amount of rudder travel available. In both sideslips and forward slips, the  point may be reached where full rudder is required to maintain heading even though the ailerons are capable of further steepening the  bank angle. This is the practical slip limit because any additional bank would cause the airplane to turn even though full opposite rudder  is being applied. If there is a need to descend more rapidly, even though the practical slip limit has been reached, lowering the nose not  only increases the sink rate but also increases airspeed. The increase in airspeed increases rudder effectiveness permitting a steeper slip.  Conversely, when the nose is raised, rudder effectiveness decreases and the bank angle should be reduced.  

Discontinuing a slip is accomplished by leveling the wings and simultaneously releasing the rudder pressure while readjusting the pitch  attitude to the normal glide attitude. If the pressure on the rudder is released abruptly, the nose swings too quickly into line and the  airplane tends to acquire excess speed. Because of the location of the pitot tube and static vents, airspeed indicators in some airplanes may  have considerable error when the airplane is in a slip. The pilot needs to be aware of this possibility and recognize a properly performed  slip by the attitude of the airplane, the sound of the airflow, and the feel of the flight controls. Unlike skids, however, if an airplane in a  slip is made to stall, it displays very little of the yawing tendency that causes a skidding stall to develop into a spin. The airplane in a slip  may do little more than tend to roll into a wings-level attitude.  

Note that some airplanes have limitations regarding slips. In some cases slips are limited in duration or by fuel quantity. These limitations  are meant to preclude fuel starvation caused when fuel is forced to one side of a tank in uncoordinated flight. If a forward slip is being  used to reach a landing area in an actual engine-out emergency, the time limitation or fuel limitation is irrelevant (unless a prolonged slip  caused the engine issue). For aerodynamic reasons, there may also be recommendations or limitations related to slips with flaps extended.  Consult the manufacturer's AFM/POH for specific airplane information.  

![](images/c358fdc72ed3600ab61c24a6d4511df64943e32549d3b563713ae550ff645fd7.jpg)  
Figure 9-14.  Forward slip.  

Some pilots try to avoid using forward slips. An approach with flaps allows for coordinated and more familiar flight orientation, while  the sideways force on the occupants of the aircraft during a forward slip may seem uncomfortable. However, in a real emergency that  involves engine failure, the ability to use a forward slip provides a pilot with a technique contributing to a better outcome. In that  situation, a pilot may initiate a descent using a forward slip much more quickly than by deploying flaps. To reduce the descent, the pilot  can remove the slip without penalty. On the other hand, retracting flaps on an approach could lead to an unwanted loss of altitude. Even  with full rudder displacement during a forward slip, the pilot can adjust to the left and right of the intended ground track by increasing  and decreasing aileron deflection. The value of the maneuver explains its inclusion as a task in the Private Pilot Airman Certification  Standards (ACS).  

# Forward Slip to a Landing  

When demonstrating a forward slip to a landing in an airport traffic pattern, the pilot plans the descent such that a forward slip may be  used on final approach. Flaps usually remain retracted, and using a forward slip on downwind or base may be a necessary part of the  maneuver. When abeam the landing point on the downwind leg, the pilot initiates a descent by reducing power to idle. If an insufficient  rate of descent occurs on downwind, the pilot uses a forward slip to increase the rate of descent. The pilot should make a coordinated  turn to base. At this point, ongoing evaluation of height takes place. If the airplane is high on base, continued forward slip should occur.  However, the pilot should make a coordinated turn to line up with the final approach course. Once established on a final approach, the  height above ground should be sufficient to allow the pilot to use a forward slip and establish a suitable approach path to the runway  aiming point. At the appropriate time, when the round out begins, the pilot removes the forward slip and transitions to a normal landing.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors with forward slips to a landing:  

1. Incorrect pitch adjustments that result in poor airspeed control.  2. Reacting to erroneous airspeed indications.  3. Using excess power while trying to lose altitude.  4. A slip in the same direction as any crosswind.  5. Poor glidepath control.  6. Late transition to a sideslip during landing with crosswinds.  7. Landing without the longitudinal axis parallel to runway.  8. Landing off the centerline.  

# Crosswind Approach and Landing  

Most runways or landing areas are such that landings need to be made while the wind is blowing at an angle to the runway rather  than parallel to the landing direction. All pilots should be prepared to manage a crosswind situation when it arises. Many of the same  basic principles and factors involved in a normal approach and landing apply to a crosswind approach and landing; therefore, only the  additional procedures required for correcting for wind drift are discussed here.  

Crosswind landings are a little more difficult to perform than crosswind takeoffs, mainly due to different inputs involved in maintaining  accurate control of the airplane while its speed is decreasing rather than increasing as on takeoff.  

There are two usual methods of accomplishing a crosswind approach and landing—the crab method and the wing-low (sideslip) method.  Although the crab method may be easier for the pilot to maintain during final approach, it requires judgment and precise timing when  removing the crab immediately prior to touchdown. The wing-low method is recommended in most cases, although a combination of  both methods may be used. While current testing standards allow for either method, pilots should learn to do both.  

# Crosswind Final Approach  

When using the crab method, the pilot makes a coordinated turn to establish a heading (crab) toward the wind. The selected heading  should align the airplane’s wings-level ground track with the centerline of the runway. The pilot makes small heading corrections, if  needed, to maintain alignment with the runway. [ Figure 9-15 ] The appropriate crab angle is maintained until just prior to touchdown,  when the pilot uses rudder control to align the longitudinal axis of the airplane with the runway to avoid sideward contact of the wheels  with the runway. A change in alignment made too early or too late results in a side load. If a long final approach is being flown, one option  is to use the crab method initially and smoothly transition to the wing-low method before the round out is started.

Figure 9-15.  Crabbed approach.  

While the wing-low (sideslip) method also compensates for a crosswind from any angle, it keeps the airplane’s ground track and  longitudinal axis aligned with the runway centerline throughout the final approach, round out, touchdown, and after-landing roll. This  prevents the airplane from touching down in a sideward motion and imposing damaging side loads on the landing gear. When first  experienced, it may seem odd to land while holding a bank angle. Although some pilots state that it appears the upwind wingtip will  strike the ground, this is not the case. This method sets up the crosswind correction well before touchdown, does not require a heading  change at the moment before touchdown, and allows the pilot to exercise smooth and continuous control. Pilots using this technique use  precise airplane control as changes in control pressure occur near the ground, on short final, and while over the runway.  

To use the wing-low method, the pilot first uses rudder to align and maintain the airplane’s heading with the runway direction. Since the  airplane is now exposed to an uncorrected crosswind, the airplane will begin to drift. Note the rate and direction of drift, and oppose it  using ailerons resulting in just enough bank to cancel the drift. [ Figure 9-16 ] Varying the amount of bank allows the pilot to drift either to  the left or to the right, and the pilot adjusts control pressures as needed to intercept and maintain the runway centerline. If the crosswind  changes, the sideslip is adjusted to keep the airplane in line with the center of the runway. [ Figure 9-17 ]

Figure 9-17.  Crosswind approach and landing.  

To correct for strong crosswind, the slip into the wind is increased by lowering the upwind wing as needed. As a consequence, this results  in a greater tendency of the airplane to turn. Since turning is not desired, considerable opposite rudder is applied to keep the airplane’s  longitudinal axis aligned with the runway. In some airplanes, there may not be sufficient rudder travel available to compensate for the  strong turning tendency caused by the steep bank. If the required bank is such that full opposite rudder does not prevent a turn, the wind  is too strong to safely land the airplane on that particular runway with those wind conditions. Since the airplane’s capability is exceeded,  it is imperative that the landing be made on a more favorable runway either at that airport or at an alternate airport.  

Flaps are used during most approaches since they tend to have a stabilizing effect on the airplane. The degree to which flaps are extended  vary with the airplane’s handling characteristics, as well as the wind velocity.  

# Crosswind Round Out (Flare)  

Generally, the round out is made like a normal landing approach, but the application of a crosswind correction is continued as necessary  to prevent drifting.  

Since the airspeed decreases as the round out progresses, the flight controls gradually become less effective. As a result, the crosswind  correction being held becomes inadequate. When using the wing-low method, it is necessary to gradually increase the deflection of the  rudder and ailerons to maintain the proper amount of drift correction.  

Keep the upwind wing down throughout the round out. If the wings are leveled, the airplane begins drifting and the touchdown occurs  while drifting. Remember, the primary objective is to land the airplane without subjecting it to any side loads that result from touching  down while drifting.  

# Crosswind Touchdown  

If the crab method of drift correction is used throughout the final approach and round out, the crab needs to be removed the instant before  touchdown by applying rudder to align the airplane’s longitudinal axis with its direction of movement.  

If the wing-low method is used, the crosswind correction is maintained throughout the round out, and the initial touchdown occurs on the  upwind main wheel. During gusty or high wind conditions, prompt adjustments are made in the crosswind correction to assure that the  airplane does not drift as the airplane touches down. As the forward momentum decreases after initial contact, the weight of the airplane  causes the downwind main wheel to gradually settle onto the runway.  

In those airplanes having nose-wheel steering interconnected with the rudder, the nose-wheel is not aligned with the runway as the main  wheels touch down because opposite rudder is being held for the crosswind correction. To prevent swerving in the direction the nose- wheel is offset, the corrective rudder pressure needs to be relaxed as the nose-wheel touches down.  

# Crosswind After-Landing Roll  

Particularly during the after-landing roll, special attention should be given to maintaining directional control by the use of rudder or  nose-wheel steering, while keeping the upwind wing from rising by the use of aileron. When an airplane is airborne, it moves with the  air mass in which it is flying regardless of the airplane’s heading and speed. When an airplane is on the ground, it is unable to move with  the air mass (crosswind) because of the resistance created by ground friction on the wheels.  

Characteristically, an airplane has a greater profile or side area behind the main landing gear than forward of the gear. With the main  wheels acting as a pivot point and the greater surface area exposed to the crosswind behind that pivot point, the airplane tends to turn or  weathervane into the wind.  

The relative wind acting on an airplane during the after-landing roll is the result of two factors. One is the natural wind, which acts in  the direction the air mass is traveling. It has a headwind component acting along the airplane’s ground track and a crosswind component  acting  $90°$   to its track. The other factor is the wind induced by the forward movement of the airplane, which acts parallel and opposite to  the direction of movement. The relative wind is the resultant of these two factors and acts from a direction somewhere between the two  components. The faster the airplane’s groundspeed, the more the relative wind aligns towards the nose of the aircraft. As the airplane’s  forward speed decreases during the after-landing roll, the forward component of the relative wind decreases, causing the relative wind to  act in a direction more aligned with the crosswind component. The greater the crosswind component, the more difficult it is to prevent  weathervaning, especially with a conventional-gear airplane.  

Maintaining control on the ground is a critical part of the after-landing roll because of the weathervaning effect of the wind on the  airplane. Additionally, tire side load from runway contact while drifting may generate a "roll-over" in a tricycle-geared airplane. This  occurs when one main wheel lifts up off the ground and the airplane tips forward along the axis between the nose-wheel and the main  wheel still on the ground. A roll-over could cause one wingtip or the prop to contact the ground. The basic factors involved are cornering  angle and side load.  

Cornering angle is the angular difference between the heading of a tire and its path. Whenever a load-bearing tire’s path and heading  diverge, a side load is created. It is accompanied by tire distortion. Although side load differs in varying tires and air pressures, it is  completely independent of speed, and through a considerable range, is directly proportional to the cornering angle and the weight  supported by the tire. As little as   $10^{\circ}$   of cornering angle creates a side load equal to half the supported weight; after   $20^{\circ}$  , the side load  does not increase with increasing cornering angle. For each high-wing, tricycle-geared airplane, there is a cornering angle at which  roll-over is inevitable. At lesser angles, the roll-over may be avoided by use of ailerons, rudder, or steerable nose-wheel, but not brakes.  

While the airplane is decelerating during the after-landing roll, more and more aileron is applied to keep the upwind wing from rising.  Since the airplane is slowing down, there is less airflow around the ailerons and they become less effective. At the same time, the relative  wind becomes more of a crosswind and exerts a greater lifting force on the upwind wing. When the airplane is coming to a stop, the  aileron control should be held fully toward the wind.  

# Maximum Safe Crosswind Velocities  

Takeoffs and landings in certain crosswind conditions are inadvisable or even dangerous. [ Figure 9-18 ] If the crosswind is great enough  to warrant an extreme drift correction, a hazardous landing condition may result. Therefore, the takeoff and landing capabilities with  respect to the reported surface wind conditions and the available landing directions should be considered.  

![](images/1b38f0c164bc30ed731d92c5b14f757164e69e839ef4d76305ca07b16a964bca.jpg)  
Figure 9-18.  Crosswind chart.  

Before an airplane is type certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), it is flight tested to ensure it meets certain  requirements. Among these is the demonstration of being satisfactorily controllable with no exceptional degree of skill or alertness on  the part of the pilot in  $90°$   crosswinds up to a velocity equal to  $0.2\;\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SO}}$  . This means a wind speed of two-tenths of the airplane’s stalling  speed with power off and in landing configuration. The demonstrated crosswind velocity is included on a placard in airplanes certificated  after May 3, 1962.  

The headwind component and the crosswind component for a given situation is determined by reference to a crosswind component chart.  [ Figure 9-19 ] It is imperative that pilots determine the maximum crosswind component of each airplane they fly and avoid operations  in wind conditions that exceed the capability of the airplane.

Figure 9-19.  Crosswind component chart.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of crosswind approaches and landings are:  

1. Attempted landing in crosswinds that exceed the airplane’s maximum demonstrated crosswind component.  2. Undershooting or overshooting the turn from base leg to final approach.  3. Inadequate compensation for wind drift on final approach.  4. Unstable approach.  5. Excessive sink rate or too low an airspeed from increased drag and reduced vertical lift during sideslip.  6. Failure to touch down with the longitudinal axis aligned with the runway.  7. Touching down while drifting.  8. Excessive airspeed on touchdown.  9. Failure to apply appropriate flight control inputs during rollout.  10. Failure to maintain direction control on rollout.  11. Excessive braking.  12. Loss of aircraft control.  

# Turbulent Air Approach and Landing  

For landing in turbulent conditions, the pilot should use a power-on approach at an airspeed slightly above the normal approach speed.  This provides for more positive control of the airplane when strong horizontal wind gusts, or up and down drafts, are experienced. Like  other power-on approaches, a coordinated combination of both pitch and power adjustments is usually required. The proper approach  attitude and airspeed require a minimum round out and should result in little or no floating during the landing.  

To maintain control during an approach in turbulent air with gusty crosswind, the pilot should use partial wing flaps. With less than full  flaps, the airplane is in a higher pitch attitude. Thus, it requires less of a pitch change to establish the landing attitude and touchdown at  a higher airspeed to ensure more positive control.  

Pilots often use the normal approach speed plus one-half of the wind gust factors in turbulent conditions. If the normal speed is 70 knots,  and the wind gusts are 15 knots, an increase of airspeed to 77 knots is appropriate. In any case, the airspeed and the flap setting should  conform to airplane manufacturer's recommendations in the AFM/POH.  

Use an adequate amount of power to maintain the proper airspeed and descent path throughout the approach, and retard the throttle to  idling position only after the main wheels contact the landing surface. Care should be exercised in closing the throttle before the pilot is  ready for touchdown. In turbulent conditions, the sudden or premature closing of the throttle may cause a sudden increase in the descent  rate, resulting in a hard landing.  

When landing from power approaches in turbulence, the touchdown is made with the airplane in approximately level flight attitude. The  pitch attitude at touchdown would be only enough to prevent the nose-wheel from contacting the surface before the main wheels have  touched the surface. After touchdown, the pilot should avoid the tendency to apply forward pressure on the yoke, as this may result in  wheelbarrowing and possible loss of control. The pilot should allow the airplane to decelerate normally, assisted by careful use of wheel  brakes and avoid heavy braking until the wings are devoid of lift and the airplane’s full weight is resting on the landing gear.  

# Short-Field Approach and Landing  

Short-field approaches and landings require the use of procedures for approaches and landings at fields with a relatively short landing  area or where an approach is made over obstacles that limit the available landing area. [ Figure 9-20  and  Figure 9-21 ] This low-speed  type of power-on approach is closely related to the performance of flight near minimum controllable airspeeds.  

![](images/5ebb51da38098cab6077c584332c698c1368a22e9920e5ab360900120defe99f.jpg)  
Figure 9-20.  Landing over an obstacle.

Figure 9-21.  Landing on a short field.  

To land within a short field or a confined area, the pilot needs to have precise, positive control of the rate of descent and airspeed, and  fly an approach that clears any obstacles, results in little or no floating during the round out, and permits the airplane to be stopped in  the shortest possible distance. When safety  and conditions permit, a wider-than-normal pattern with a longer final approach may be  used. This allows the pilot ample opportunity to adjust and stabilize the descent angle after the airplane is configured and trimmed. A  stabilized approach is essential.  

The procedures for landing on a short field or for landing approaches over obstacles as recommended in the AFM/POH should be used.  [ Figure 9-22  and  Figure 9-23 ] These procedures generally involve a final approach started from an altitude of at least 500 feet higher  than the touchdown area and the use of full flaps at an appropriate point during the final approach. For many general aviation airplanes  this means flying a stabilized final approach with the flap setting that precedes full flaps. When the field is made, the pilot should  extend full flaps and lower the nose in order to maintain airspeed and keep the aiming point stationary in the windscreen. When over  the obstacle, the pilot may reduce power slightly. Ideally, if full flaps are extended at the correct point, the pilot will be in a position to  slowly reduce power. When no manufacturer’s recommended approach speed is available, a speed of not more than   $1.3\;\mathrm{V_{SO}}$   is used. In  gusty air, no more than one-half the gust factor is added. An excessive amount of airspeed could result in a touchdown too far from the  runway threshold or an after-landing roll that exceeds the available landing area. When obstacles are present, a slightly steeper approach  angle places the touchdown closer to the obstacle, which gives the pilot more room to stop.  

![](images/8d0fc3dd15f332d1d50e9c1b5100e5c8c3836ebc476c9f6cace9fe99c2c4f91f.jpg)  
Figure 9-22.  Stabilized approach.

Figure 9-23.  Unstabilized approach.  

After the landing gear has been extended, if applicable, or when beginning a suitable final approach, the pilot simultaneously adjusts the  power and the pitch attitude to establish and maintain the proper descent angle and airspeed. During a stabilized approach, small changes  in the airplane’s pitch attitude and power setting are needed when making corrections to the angle of descent and airspeed.  

The short-field approach and landing is an accuracy approach to an aiming point. The procedures previously outlined in the section on  the stabilized approach concept are used. If it appears that the obstacle clearance is excessive and touchdown occurs well beyond the  desired aiming point, leaving insufficient room to stop, power is reduced while lowering the pitch attitude to steepen the descent path  and increase the rate of descent. If it appears that the descent angle does not ensure safe clearance of obstacles, power is increased while  simultaneously raising the pitch attitude to shallow the descent path and decrease the rate of descent. Care should be taken to avoid  excessively low airspeeds. When operating at high AOAs and low airspeeds, an increase in pitch attitude increases the rate of descent.  When there is doubt regarding the outcome of the approach, the pilot should execute a go-around, evaluate the situation, and decide  whether to make another approach or divert to a more suitable landing area.  

Because the final approach over obstacles is made at a relatively steep approach angle and close to the airplane’s stalling speed, the  initiation of the round out or flare needs to be judged accurately to avoid flying into the ground or stalling prematurely and sinking  rapidly. A lack of floating during the flare with sufficient control to touch down properly is verification that the approach speed was  correct.  

Touchdown should occur at the minimum controllable airspeed with the airplane in approximately the pitch attitude that results in a  power-off stall when the throttle is closed. Care should be exercised to avoid closing the throttle too rapidly, as closing the throttle may  result in an immediate increase in the rate of descent and a hard landing. Note that a small amount of power provides more airflow over  the elevator giving it more authority at low airspeeds to enable the pilot to flare. There is a risk that low airspeed and a windmilling  propeller blocking airflow over the elevator may make it difficult to flare.  

Upon touchdown, the airplane is held in this positive pitch attitude as long as the elevators remain effective and if recommended by the  manufacturer. This provides aerodynamic braking to assist in deceleration. However, immediately upon touchdown of the nose-wheel,  maximum braking is applied to minimize the after-landing roll. For most airplanes, aerodynamic drag is the single biggest factor in  slowing the aircraft in the first quarter of its speed decay. Brakes become increasingly effective as airspeed and lift decrease. The pilot  increases braking effectiveness by holding the wheel or stick full back while smoothly applying brakes. Back pressure is needed because  the airplane tends to lean forward with heavy braking. Best braking results are always achieved with the wheels in an “incipient skid  condition.” That means a little more brake pressure would lock up the wheels entirely. In an incipient skid, the wheels are turning, but  with great reluctance. If the wheels lock, braking effectiveness drops dramatically in a skid and the tires could be damaged. The airplane  is normally stopped within the shortest possible distance consistent with safety and controllability. If the proper approach speed has been  maintained, resulting in minimum float during the round out and the touchdown made at minimum control speed, excessive braking  should not be needed.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of short-field approaches and landings are:  

1. A final approach that necessitates an overly steep approach and high sink rate.  2. Unstable approach.  3. Undue delay in initiating glide path corrections.  4. Too low an airspeed on final resulting in inability to flare properly and landing hard.  5. Too high an airspeed resulting in floating on round out.  6. Prematurely reducing power to idle on round out resulting in hard landing.  7. Touchdown with excessive airspeed.  8. Excessive and/or unnecessary braking after touchdown.  9. Failure to maintain directional control.  10. Failure to recognize and abort a poor approach that cannot be completed safely.  

# Soft-Field Approach and Landing  

Landing on fields that are rough or have soft surfaces, such as snow, sand, mud, or tall grass, requires unique procedures. When landing  on such surfaces, the objective is to touch down as smoothly as possible and at the slowest possible landing speed. A pilot needs to control  the airplane in a manner that the wings support the weight of the airplane as long as practical to minimize stresses imposed on the landing  gear by a rough surface or to prevent sinking into a soft surface.  

The approach for the soft-field landing is similar to the normal approach used for operating into long, firm landing areas. The major  difference between the two is that a degree of power is used throughout the level-off and touchdown for the soft-field landing. This allows  the airspeed to slowly dissipate while the airplane is flown 1 to 2 feet off the surface in ground effect. When the wheels first touch the  ground, the wings continue to support much of the weight of the airplane. [ Figure 9-24 ] This technique minimizes the nose-over forces  that suddenly affect the airplane at the moment of touchdown.  

![](images/0195445a22987d1c327e826a05d3d3df32cca826f68d1580a6c61a8e7c0f2b7d.jpg)  
Figure 9-24.  Soft/rough field approach and landing.  

The use of flaps during soft-field landings aids in touching down at minimum speed and is recommended whenever practical. In low-wing  airplanes, the flaps may suffer damage from mud, stones, or slush thrown up by the wheels. If flaps are used, it is generally inadvisable  to retract them during the after-landing roll because the need for flap retraction is less important than the need for total concentration on  maintaining full control of the airplane.  

The final-approach airspeed used for short-field landings is equally appropriate to soft-field landings. The use of higher approach speeds  may result in excessive float in ground effect, and floating makes a smooth, controlled touchdown even more difficult. There is no reason  for a steep angle of descent unless obstacles are present in the approach path.  

Touchdown on a soft or rough field is made at the lowest possible airspeed with the airplane in a nose-high pitch attitude. In nose-wheel  type airplanes, after the main wheels touch the surface, the pilot should hold sufficient back-elevator pressure to keep the nose-wheel off  the surface. Using back-elevator pressure and engine power, the pilot can control the rate at which the weight of the airplane is transferred  from the wings to the wheels.  

Field conditions may warrant that the pilot maintain a flight condition in which the main wheels are just touching the surface but the  weight of the airplane is still being supported by the wings until a suitable taxi surface is reached. At any time during this transition  phase, before the weight of the airplane is being supported by the wheels, and before the nose-wheel is on the surface, the ability is  retained to apply full power and perform a safe takeoff (obstacle clearance and field length permitting) should the pilot elect to abandon  the landing. Once committed to a landing, the pilot should gently lower the nose-wheel to the surface. A slight addition of power usually  aids in easing the nose-wheel down.  

The use of brakes on a soft field is not needed and should be avoided as this may tend to impose a heavy load on the nose-gear due to  premature or hard contact with the landing surface, causing the nose-wheel to dig in. The soft or rough surface itself provides sufficient  reduction in the airplane’s forward speed. Often upon landing on a very soft field, an increase in power may be needed to keep the  airplane moving and from becoming stuck in the soft surface.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of soft-field approaches and landings are:  

1. Excessive descent rate on final approach.  2. Excessive airspeed on final approach.  3. Unstable approach.  4. Round out too high above the runway surface.  5. Poor power management during round out and touchdown.  6. Hard touchdown.  7. Inadequate control of the airplane weight transfer from wings to wheels after touchdown.  8. Allowing the nose-wheel to “fall” to the runway after touchdown rather than controlling its descent.  

# Power-Off Accuracy Approaches  

Power-off accuracy approaches and landings involve gliding to a touchdown at a given point (or within a specified distance beyond  that point), while using a specific pattern and with the engine idling. The objective is to instill in the pilot the judgment and procedures  necessary for accurately flying the airplane, without power, to a safe landing.  

The ability to estimate the distance an airplane glides to a landing is the real basis of all power-off accuracy approaches and landings.  The distance to be covered largely determines the amount of maneuvering needed to complete an approach from a given altitude. While  developing the pilot's ability to estimate gliding distance, power-off accuracy approaches call upon the pilot to use a variety of techniques  to set and maintain an appropriate glide angle and airspeed to the aiming point.  

With experience and practice, altitudes up to approximately 1,000 feet can be estimated with fair accuracy; while above this level the  accuracy in judgment of height above the ground decreases, since all features tend to merge. The best aid in perfecting the ability to  judge height above this altitude is through the indications of the altimeter and associating them with the general appearance of the earth.  

The judgment of altitude in feet, hundreds of feet, or thousands of feet is not as important as the ability to estimate gliding angle and  its resultant distance. Regardless of altitude, a pilot who knows the normal glide angle of the airplane can estimate, with reasonable  accuracy, the approximate spot along a given ground path at which the airplane will land. A pilot who has the ability to accurately  estimate altitude, can also judge how much maneuvering is possible and safe during the glide, which is important to the choice of landing  areas in an actual emergency.  

The objective of a good final approach is to descend at an angle that permits the airplane to reach the desired aiming point at an airspeed  that results in a predictable float where touchdown occurs on or within a specified distance beyond a designated point. To accomplish  this, it is essential that both the descent angle and the airspeed be accurately controlled.  

Unlike a normal approach when the power setting is variable, on a power-off approach the power is fixed at the idle setting. Pitch attitude  is adjusted to control the airspeed. This also changes the glide or descent angle. If an airplane is on approach with an airspeed higher  than best glide, pitching down will increase the airspeed and steepen the descent angle, while pitching up will reduce the airspeed and  shallow the descent angle. Conversely, if the airspeed is below best glide, then pitching down will increase the airspeed and shallow the  descent angle, while pitching up will reduce the airspeed and will greatly steepen the descent angle. If the airspeed is too high, the pilot  should raise the nose; and when the airspeed is too low, lower the nose. If the pitch attitude is raised too high, the airplane settles rapidly  due to a slow airspeed and insufficient lift. For this reason, the pilot should never try to stretch a glide to reach the desired landing spot.  

Note that certain single-engine turboprop airplanes experience an excessive rate of descent if the power is set to flight idle. In some cases,  if the powerplant failed, the manufacturer's checklist calls for feathering the propeller during a power-off glide. During flight training  in these airplanes, the propeller is not feathered as would be the case in an emergency or true power-off glide. During training and pilot  certification, where the manufacturer's checklist calls for propeller feathering in a power-off situation, the pilot should set sufficient  power to provide the performance that would be expected with the propeller feathered.  

Uniform approach patterns, such as the  $90°$   or  $180^{\circ}$   power-off approaches, are described further in this chapter. Practicing these approaches  provides a pilot with a basis on which to develop judgment in gliding distance and in planning an approach. While square patterns  demonstrate good planning, they are not required and may not be appropriate for every approach. For example, when conditions are not  as expected, pilots may need to dog-leg away from the runway on base or dog-leg toward the runway on base. Pilots may use S-turns,  slips, early or late extension of flaps, reduce airspeed below best glide, or increase airspeed slightly above best glide in a headwind in  order to stabilize the remaining approach, to reach the desired aiming point at an appropriate speed, and to touch down where planned.  Note that selection of the runway numbers as the touchdown point does not provide a safety cushion in case of a mechanical problem or  misjudgment. Selecting a point farther down the runway establishes an increased safety margin.  

The basic procedure in these approaches involves closing the throttle at a given altitude and gliding to a key position. Starting with the  same energy (airspeed and height) each time the throttle is closed, makes the maneuver more predictable. The key position, like the  pattern itself, is not the primary objective; it is merely a convenient point in the air from which the pilot can judge what to do such that  the landing occurs at or just beyond the desired point. The selected key position should be one that is appropriate for the available altitude  and the wind condition. From the key position, the pilot should constantly evaluate the situation.  

It should be emphasized that, although accurate spot touchdowns are important, safe and properly executed approaches and landings are  vital. A pilot should never sacrifice a good approach or landing just to land on the desired spot.  

#  $\mathtt{90^{\circ}}$   Power-Off Approach  

The  $90°$   power-off approach is made from a base leg and requires an approximate  $90^{\circ}$   turn onto the final approach. The approach path  may be varied by positioning the base leg closer to or farther out from the approach end of the runway according to wind conditions.  [ Figure 9-25 ] The glide from the key position on the base leg through the   $90°$   turn to the final approach is the final part of all accuracy  landing maneuvers. The  $90°$   power-off approach usually begins from a rectangular pattern at approximately 1,000 feet above the ground  or at normal traffic pattern altitude. The airplane is flown on a downwind leg at the same distance from the landing surface as in a normal  traffic pattern. The before-landing checklist should be completed on the downwind leg, including extension of the landing gear if the  airplane is equipped with retractable gear.

Figure 9-25.  Plan the base leg for wind conditions.  

After a medium-banked turn onto the base leg is completed, the throttle is retarded slightly and the airspeed allowed to decrease to the  normal base-leg speed. [ Figure 9-26 ] On the base leg, the airspeed, wind drift correction, and altitude are maintained while proceeding  to the   $45^{\circ}$   key position. At this position, the intended landing spot appears to be on a  $45^{\circ}$   angle from the airplane’s nose.  

![](images/445ad67daa8b0e64feffcfbf017f9868bebf18eed5a1989709dbfefc618de017.jpg)  
Figure 9-26.  $90°$   power-off approach.  

The pilot can determine the strength and direction of the wind from the amount of crab necessary to hold the desired ground track on the  base leg. This helps in planning the turn onto the final approach and provides some indication of when to lower the flaps.  

At the   $45^{\circ}$   key position, the throttle is closed completely, the propeller control (if equipped) advanced to the full increase revolution  per minute (rpm) position, and altitude maintained until the airspeed decreases to the manufacturer’s recommended glide speed. In the  absence of a recommended speed, the pilot should use  $1.4\,\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  . When this airspeed is attained, the nose is lowered to maintain the gliding  speed and the controls trimmed. The wing flaps may be gradually lowered and the pitch attitude adjusted, as needed, to establish the  proper descent angle. The base-to-final turn is planned and accomplished so that upon rolling out of the turn, the airplane is aligned with  the runway centerline. If the approach is planned to be slightly high in the current configuration, the pilot will be assured of making the  aiming point. The wing flaps may be lowered, as needed, and the pitch attitude adjusted, as needed, to establish the proper descent angle  and airspeed   $(1.3\;\mathrm{V_{SO}})$  ), and the controls trimmed. Slight adjustments in pitch attitude and slips are used as necessary to control the glide  angle and airspeed. A crab or side slip can be used to maintain the desired flight path. A forward slip may be used momentarily to steepen  the descent without changing the airspeed. Full flaps should be delayed until it is clear that adding them will not cause the landing to be  short of the point. The pilot should never try to stretch the glide or retract the flaps to reach the desired landing spot.  

On short final, full attention is given to making a good, safe landing rather than concentrating on the selected landing spot. The approach  angle used and final approach airspeed determine the probability of landing on the spot, and late adjustments to these parameters are not  appropriate. It is always better to execute a good landing away from the spot than to make a poor landing precisely on or just past the spot.  

#  $\mathbf{\uparrow80^{\circ}}$   Power-Off Approach  

The   $180^{\circ}$   power-off approach is executed by gliding with idle power from a given point on a downwind leg to a preselected landing  spot. [ Figure 9-27 ] It is an extension of the principles involved in the  $90°$   power-off approach just described. The objective is to further  develop judgment in estimating distances and glide ratios, in that the airplane is flown without power from a higher altitude and through  a   $90°$   turn to reach the base-leg position at a proper altitude for executing the  $90°$   approach.  

![](images/6368af81b61e3a37641b9d43303523c6b8aac496b8149f734589ef884e231606.jpg)  
Figure 9-27.    $I80^{\circ}$   power-off approach.  

The  $180^{\circ}$   power-off approach requires more planning and judgment than the  $90°$   power-off approach. In the execution of  $180^{\circ}$   power-off  approaches, the airplane is flown on a downwind heading parallel to the landing runway. The altitude from which this type of approach  is started varies with the type of airplane, but should usually not exceed 1,000 feet above the ground, except with large airplanes. Greater  accuracy in judgment and maneuvering is required at higher altitudes.  

When abreast of or opposite the desired landing spot, the throttle is closed and altitude maintained while decelerating to the manufacturer’s  recommended glide speed or   $1.4\;\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  . The point at which the throttle is closed is the downwind key position.  

The turn from the downwind leg to the base leg is a uniform turn with a medium or slightly steeper bank. The degree of bank and amount  of this initial turn depend upon the glide angle of the airplane and the velocity and direction of the wind. Again, the base leg is positioned  as needed for the altitude or wind condition. Position the base leg to conserve or dissipate altitude so as to reach the desired landing spot.  

The turn onto the base leg is made at an altitude high enough and close enough to permit the airplane to glide to what would normally be  the base key position in a  $90°$   power-off approach.  Initial flaps may be extended prior to the base key position if needed.  

Although the base key position is important, it should not be overemphasized nor considered as a fixed point on the ground. Many  inexperienced pilots may gain a conception of it as a particular landmark, such as a tree, crossroad, or other visual reference, to be  reached at a certain altitude. This misconception leaves the pilot at a total loss any time such objects are not present. Both altitude and  geographical location should be varied as much as is practical to eliminate any such misconceptions. After reaching the base key position,  the approach and landing are the same as in the  $90°$   power-off approach.  

# Common Errors  

Common errors in the performance of power-off accuracy approaches are:  

1. Downwind leg is too far from the runway/landing area.  2. Overextension of downwind leg resulting from a tailwind.  3. Inadequate compensation for wind drift on base leg.  4. Skidding turns in an effort to increase gliding distance.  5. Failure to lower landing gear in retractable gear airplanes.  6. Attempting to “stretch” the glide during an undershoot.  7. Premature flap extension/landing gear extension.  8. Use of throttle to increase the glide instead of merely clearing the engine.  9. Forcing the airplane onto the runway in order to avoid overshooting the designated landing spot.  

# Emergency Approaches and Landings (Simulated)  

During dual training flights, the instructor should give simulated emergency landings by retarding the throttle and calling “simulated  emergency landing.” The objective of these simulated emergency landings is to develop a pilot’s accuracy, judgment, planning, procedures,  and confidence when little or no power is available. A simulated emergency landing may be given with the airplane in any configuration.  If the simulated power failure occurs while above best glide speed, the pilot allows the airplane to slow (or may even bleed off speed by  climbing) until reaching best glide speed. When reaching that speed, the nose can be lowered and the airplane trimmed to maintain that  speed. If the failure occurs at or below best glide speed, the nose should be lowered immediately to maintain or accelerate to best glide  speed. The pilot should ensure that the flaps and landing gear are in the proper configuration for the existing situation.  

A constant gliding speed is usually maintained because variations of gliding speed nullify all attempts at accuracy in judgment of gliding  distance and the landing spot. The many variables, such as altitude, obstruction, wind direction, landing direction, landing surface and  gradient, and landing distance requirements of the airplane, determine the pattern and approach procedures to use.  

The pilot may use any combination of normal gliding maneuvers, from wings level to spirals to eventually arrive at the normal key  position at a normal traffic pattern altitude for the selected landing area. From the key point on, the approach is a normal power-off  approach. [ Figure 9-28 ]  

![](images/c846105d74948df47a488508d7442b409375f2363692368a414a883865f70c1d.jpg)  
Figure 9-28.  Remain over intended landing area.  

With the greater choice of fields afforded by higher altitudes, the inexperienced pilot may be inclined to delay making a decision, and  with considerable altitude in which to maneuver, errors in maneuvering and estimation of glide distance may develop.  

All pilots should learn to determine the wind direction and estimate its speed from the windsock at the airport, smoke from factories or  houses, dust, brush fires, wind farms, or patterns displayed on nearby bodies of water .  

Once a field has been selected, a pilot should indicate the proposed landing area to the instructor. Normally, the pilot should plan and fly  a pattern for landing on the field first elected until the instructor terminates the simulated emergency landing. This provides the instructor  an opportunity to explain and correct any errors; it also gives the pilot an opportunity to see the results of the errors. However, if the  pilot realizes during the approach that a poor field has been selected—one that would obviously result in disaster if a landing were to be  made—and there is a more advantageous field within gliding distance, a change to the better field should be permitted. The instructor  should thoroughly explain the hazards involved in these last-minute decisions, such as excessive maneuvering at very low altitudes.  

Instructors should stress slipping the airplane, using flaps, varying the position of the base leg, and varying the turn onto final approach  as ways of correcting for misjudgment of altitude and glide angle.  

Eagerness to get down is one of the most common faults of inexperienced pilots during simulated emergency landings. They forget about  speed and arrive at the edge of the field with too much speed to permit a safe landing. Too much speed is just as dangerous as too little;  

it results in excessive floating and overshooting the desired landing spot. Instructors need to stress during their instruction that pilots  cannot dive at a field and expect to land on it.  

During all simulated emergency landings, keep the engine warm and cleared. During a simulated emergency landing, either the instructor  or the pilot should have complete control of the throttle. There should be no doubt as to who has control since many near accidents have  occurred from such misunderstandings.  

Every simulated emergency landing approach is terminated as soon as it can be determined whether or not a safe landing is assured. In  no case should it be continued to a point where it creates an undue hazard or an annoyance to persons or property on the ground.  

In addition to flying the airplane from the point of simulated engine failure to where it is known that a reasonable safe landing could be  made (or to where it is known that the approach cannot be salvaged), a pilot should also receive instruction on certain emergency flight  deck procedures. The habit of performing these procedures should be developed to such an extent that, if an engine failure actually  occurs, a pilot checks the critical items that might get the engine operating again while selecting a field and planning an approach.  Combining the two operations—accomplishing emergency procedures and planning and flying the approach—is difficult during the  early training in emergency landings.  

There are steps and procedures pilots should follow in a simulated emergency landing. Although they may differ somewhat from the  procedures used in an actual emergency, they should be learned thoroughly and each step called out to the instructor. The use of a  checklist is strongly recommended. Most airplane manufacturers provide a checklist of the appropriate items. [ Figure 9-29 ]  

![](images/fcb588cf5043a392ffc833d28fd74f16e36c5059918306bd4e12b643943355af.jpg)  
Figure 9-29.  Sample emergency checklist.  

Critical items to be checked include the position of the fuel tank selector, the quantity of fuel in the tank selected, the fuel pressure gauge  to see if the electric fuel pump is needed, the position of the mixture control, the position of the magneto switch, and the use of carburetor  heat. Many actual emergency landings have been made and later found to be the result of the fuel selector valve being positioned to an  empty tank while the other tank had plenty of fuel. It may be wise to change the position of the fuel selector valve even though the fuel  gauge indicates fuel in all tanks because fuel gauges can be inaccurate. Many actual emergency landings could have been prevented if  the pilots had developed the habit of checking these critical items during flight training.  

Instruction in emergency procedures is not limited to simulated emergency landings caused by power failures. Other emergencies  associated with the operation of the airplane should be explained, demonstrated, and practiced if practicable. Among these emergencies  are fire in flight, electrical or hydraulic system malfunctions, unexpected severe weather conditions, engine overheating, imminent fuel  exhaustion, and the emergency operation of airplane systems and equipment.  

# Faulty Approaches and Landings  

Landing involves many precise, time-sensitive, and sequential control inputs. When corrected early, small errors are often not noticeable.  On the other hand, uncorrected errors may place the airplane and occupants in an undesirable state. Since pilot training normally includes  exposure to landing deviations and their appropriate remedies, this section covers several common landing imperfections.  

# Low Final Approach  

When the base leg is too low, insufficient power is used, landing flaps are extended prematurely, or the velocity of the wind is misjudged,  the airplane may be well below the proper final approach path. In such a situation, the pilot would have to apply considerable power  to fly the airplane (at an excessively low altitude) up to the runway threshold. When it is realized the runway cannot be reached unless  appropriate action is taken, power should be applied immediately to maintain the airspeed while the pitch attitude is raised to increase  lift and stop the descent. When the proper approach path has been intercepted, the correct approach attitude is reestablished and the  power reduced and a stabilized approach maintained. [ Figure 9-30 ] The pilot should not increase the pitch attitude without increasing  the power because the airplane decelerates rapidly and may approach the critical AOA and stall. In addition, the pilot should not retract  the flaps since this causes a sudden decrease in lift and causes the airplane to sink more rapidly. If there is any doubt about the approach  being safely completed, it is advisable to execute an immediate go-around.  

![](images/e10e5b29d8b67c46597e6d1beb88b92537213444559125f3da27c02f2745a3ea.jpg)  
Figure 9-30.  Right and wrong methods of correction for low final approach.  

# High Final Approach  

When the final approach is too high, the pilot may lower the flaps as required. Further reduction in power may be necessary, while  lowering the nose simultaneously to maintain approach airspeed and steepen the approach path. [ Figure 9-31 ] Alternatively, the pilot  could use a forward slip to increase the descent angle and rate of descent while maintaining proper approach speed. Since a sink rate  in excess of 800–1,000 feet per minute (fpm) is considered excessive, either technique avoids the high sink rates that would occur if  the pilot dives the airplane toward the aiming point. Since a high sink rate continued close to the surface makes it be difficult to slow  to a proper rate prior to ground contact, it is not a good idea to dive toward the aiming point. Therefore, when intercepting the proper  approach path from above, the pilot adjusts the power as required to maintain a stabilized approach. A go-around should be initiated if  the sink rate becomes excessive.  

![](images/17d709cfafe651ef46e5a436af64fc17290508f176f9fe07499ac1ce6faa8407.jpg)  
Figure 9-31.  Change in glidepath and increase in descent rate for high final approach.  

# Slow Final Approach  

On the final approach, when the airplane is flown at a slower than normal airspeed, the pilot’s judgment of the rate of sink (descent) and  the height of round out is difficult. During an excessively slow approach, the wing is operating near the critical AOA and, depending on  the pitch attitude changes and control usage, the airplane may stall or sink rapidly, contacting the ground with a hard impact.  

Whenever a slow speed approach is noted, the pilot should apply power to accelerate the airplane and increase the lift to reduce the sink  rate and to prevent a stall. This is done while still at a high enough altitude to reestablish the correct approach airspeed and attitude. If  too slow and too low, it is best to execute a go-around.  

# Use of Power  

Power can be used effectively during the approach and round out to compensate for errors in judgment. Power may be added to accelerate  the airplane, to increase lift without increasing the AOA, and to slow the descent to an acceptable rate. The increased propwash over the  wing behind the propeller(s) also provides an immediate boost in lift that also helps slow the descent rate. If the proper landing attitude is  attained and the airplane is only slightly high, the landing attitude is held constant and sufficient power applied to help ease the airplane  onto the ground. After the airplane has touched down, the pilot closes the throttle so the additional thrust and lift are removed and the  airplane remains on the ground.  

# High Round Out  

Sometimes when the airplane appears to temporarily stop moving downward, the round out has been made too rapidly and the airplane  is flying level, too high above the runway. Continuing the round out further reduces the airspeed and increases the AOA to the critical  angle. This results in the airplane stalling and dropping hard onto the runway. To prevent this, the pitch attitude is held constant until  the airplane decelerates enough to again start descending. Then the round out is continued to establish the proper landing attitude. This  procedure is only used when there is adequate airspeed. It may be necessary to add a slight amount of power to keep the airspeed from  decreasing excessively and to avoid losing lift too rapidly.  

When the proper landing attitude is attained, the airplane is approaching a stall because the airspeed is decreasing and the critical AOA  is being approached, even though the pitch attitude is no longer being increased. [ Figure 9-32 ]  

![](images/1828f953dc645c4ba0440d71fc900b9ffb41615a94599ffb110da4a215a60b7e.jpg)  
Figure 9-32.  Rounding out too high.  

Although back-elevator pressure may be relaxed slightly, the nose should not be lowered to make the airplane descend when fairly  close to the runway unless some power is added momentarily. The momentary decrease in lift that results from lowering the nose and  decreasing the AOA might cause the airplane to contact the ground with the nose-wheel first and may result in nose gear damage or  collapse.  

It is recommended that a go-around be executed any time it appears the nose needs to be lowered significantly or that the landing is in  any other way uncertain.  

# Late or Rapid Round Out  

Starting the round out too late or pulling the elevator control back too rapidly to prevent the airplane from touching down prematurely  can impose a significant load on the wings and cause an accelerated stall.  

Suddenly increasing the AOA and stalling the airplane during a round out is a dangerous situation since it may cause the airplane to land  extremely hard on the main landing gear and then bounce back into the air. As the airplane contacts the ground, the tail is forced down  very rapidly by the back-elevator pressure and by inertia acting downward on the tail.  

Recovery from this situation requires prompt and positive application of power prior to occurrence of the stall. This may be followed by  a normal landing if sufficient runway is available—otherwise the pilot should execute a go-around immediately.  

If the round out is late and uncorrected, the nose-wheel may strike the runway first, causing the nose to bounce upward. Do not attempt  to force the airplane back onto the ground; execute a go-around immediately.  

# Floating During Round Out  

If the airspeed on final approach is excessive, it usually results in the airplane floating. [ Figure 9-33 ] Before touchdown can be made,  the airplane may be well past the desired landing point and the available runway may be insufficient. When diving the airplane on final  approach to land at the proper point, there is an appreciable increase in airspeed. The proper touchdown attitude cannot be established  without producing an excessive AOA and lift. This causes the airplane to gain altitude or balloon.  

![](images/7f16e5aa7416e8a8783b82bde8fb6f75020aaa995a184b513283c03abe2380eb.jpg)  
Figure 9-33.  Floating during round out.  

Any time the airplane floats, judgment of speed, height, and rate of sink needs to be especially acute. The pilot should smoothly and  gradually adjust the pitch attitude as the airplane decelerates to touchdown speed and starts to settle, so the proper landing attitude is  attained at the moment of touchdown. The slightest error in judgment and timing results in either ballooning or bouncing.  

The recovery from floating is dependent upon the amount of floating and the effect of any crosswind, as well as the amount of runway  remaining. Since prolonged floating utilizes considerable runway length, it should be avoided especially on short runways or in strong  crosswinds. If a landing cannot be made on the first third of the runway, or the airplane drifts sideways, execute a go-around.  

# Ballooning During Round Out  

If the pilot misjudges the rate of sink during a landing and thinks the airplane is descending faster than it should, there is a tendency to  increase the pitch attitude and AOA too rapidly. This not only stops the descent, but actually starts the airplane climbing. This climbing  during the round out is known as ballooning. [ Figure 9-34 ] Ballooning is dangerous because the height above the ground is increasing  and the airplane is rapidly approaching a stalled condition. The altitude gained in each instance depends on the airspeed or the speed with  which the pitch attitude is increased.  

![](images/80f6de42e4848887a76ad88d64c6b881cd39e484ee230291eaaf07282bcc4b1f.jpg)  
Figure 9-34.  Ballooning during roundout.  

Depending on the severity of ballooning, the use of throttle is helpful in cushioning the landing. By adding power, thrust is increased to  keep the airspeed from decelerating too rapidly and the wings from suddenly losing lift, but throttle should be closed immediately after  touchdown. Torque effects vary as power is changed, and it is necessary to use rudder pressure to keep the airplane straight as it settles  onto the runway.  

The pilot needs to be extremely cautious of ballooning when there is a crosswind present because the crosswind correction may be  inadvertently released or it may become inadequate. Because of the lower airspeed after ballooning, the crosswind affects the airplane  more. Consequently, the wing has to be lowered even further to compensate for the increased drift. It is imperative that the pilot makes  certain that the appropriate wing is down and that directional control is maintained with opposite rudder. If there is any doubt, or the  airplane starts to drift, the pilot should execute a go-around.  

When ballooning is excessive, it is best to execute a go-around immediately and not attempt to salvage the landing. Power should be  applied before the airplane enters a stalled condition.  

# Bouncing During Touchdown  

When the airplane contacts the ground with a sharp impact as the result of an improper attitude or an excessive rate of sink, it tends to  bounce back into the air. Though the airplane’s tires and shock struts provide some springing action, the airplane does not bounce like a  rubber ball. Instead, it rebounds into the air because the wing’s AOA was abruptly increased, producing a sudden addition of lift. [ Figure  9-35 ]  

![](images/d7d67dc16e3aef99eac812feebcc22c85531a4ca592c92abad4d8766a8e8023f.jpg)  
Figure 9-35.  Bouncing during touchdown.  

The abrupt change in AOA is the result of inertia instantly forcing the airplane’s tail downward when the main wheels contact the ground  sharply. The severity of the bounce depends on the airspeed at the moment of contact and the degree to which the AOA or pitch attitude  was increased.  

Since a bounce occurs when the airplane makes contact with the ground before the proper touchdown attitude is attained, it is almost  invariably accompanied by the application of excessive back-elevator pressure. This is usually the result of the pilot realizing too late  that the airplane is not in the proper attitude and attempting to establish it just as the second touchdown occurs.  

The corrective action for a bounce is the same as for ballooning and similarly depends on its severity. When it is very slight and there  is no extreme change in the airplane’s pitch attitude, a follow-up landing may be executed by applying sufficient power to cushion the  subsequent touchdown and smoothly adjusting the pitch to the proper touchdown attitude.  

In the event a very slight bounce is encountered while landing with a crosswind, crosswind correction needs to be maintained while the  next touchdown is made. Since the subsequent touchdown is made at a slower airspeed, the upwind wing has to be lowered even further  to compensate for drift.  

Extreme caution and alertness should be exercised any time a bounce occurs, but particularly when there is a crosswind. Pilots should not  release the crosswind correction. When one main wheel of the airplane strikes the runway, the other wheel touches down immediately  afterwards, and the wings become level. Then, with no crosswind correction as the airplane bounces, the wind causes the airplane to roll  with the wind, thus exposing even more surface to the crosswind and increasing any drift.  

When a bounce is severe, the safest procedure is to execute a go-around immediately. The pilot should not attempt to salvage the  landing. Apply full power while simultaneously maintaining directional control and lowering the nose to a safe climb attitude. The go- around procedure should be continued even though the airplane may descend and another bounce may be encountered. Landing from  a bad bounce should not be attempted,  since airspeed diminishes very rapidly in the nose-high attitude, and a stall may occur before a  subsequent touchdown can be made.  

# Porpoising  

In a bounced landing that is improperly recovered, the airplane comes in nose first, initiating a series of motions imitating the jumps and  dives of a porpoise. [ Figure 9-36 ] The improper airplane attitude at touchdown may be caused by inattention, not knowing where the  ground is, miss-trimming, or forcing the airplane onto the runway.  

![](images/b6c19512bb9b97c544a5ed9824699c0b461317b3ebbbcfcb973893be6ad1f8ae.jpg)  
Figure 9-36.  Porpoising.  

Ground effect decreases elevator control effectiveness and increases the effort required to raise the nose. Not enough elevator or stabilator  trim can result in a nose low contact with the runway and a porpoise develops.  

Porpoising can also be caused by improper airspeed control. Usually, if an approach is too fast, the airplane floats and the pilot tries  to force it on the runway when the airplane still wants to fly. A gust of wind, a bump in the runway, or even a slight tug on the control  wheel sends the airplane aloft again.  

The corrective action for a porpoise is the same as for a bounce and similarly depends on its severity. When it is very slight and there  is no extreme change in the airplane’s pitch attitude, a follow-up landing may be executed by applying sufficient power to cushion the  subsequent touchdown and smoothly adjusting the pitch to the proper touchdown attitude.  

When pilots attempt to correct a severe porpoise with flight control and power inputs, the inputs are often untimely may increase the  severity of each successive contact with the surface. These unintentional and increasing pilot-induced oscillations may lead to damage  or collapse of the nose gear. When porpoising is severe or seems to be getting worse, the safest procedure is to execute a go-around  immediately by applying full power while simultaneously maintaining directional control and lowering the nose to a safe climb attitude.  

# Wheelbarrowing  

When a pilot permits the airplane weight to become concentrated about the nose-wheel during the takeoff or landing roll, a condition  known as wheelbarrowing occurs. Wheelbarrowing may cause loss of directional control during the landing roll because braking action  is ineffective, and the airplane tends to swerve or pivot on the nose-wheel, particularly in crosswind conditions. One of the most common  causes of wheelbarrowing during the landing roll is a simultaneous touchdown of the main and nose-wheel with excessive speed,  followed by application of forward pressure on the elevator control. Usually, the situation can be corrected by smoothly applying back- elevator pressure.  

Wheelbarrowing does not occur if the pilot achieves and maintains the correct landing attitude, touches down at the proper speed, and  gently lowers the nose-wheel while losing speed on rollout. However, if wheelbarrowing is encountered and runway and other conditions  permit, it is advisable to promptly initiate a go-around. If the pilot decides it's safer to stay on the ground rather than attempt a go-around  when directional control is lost, close the throttle and adjust the pitch attitude smoothly but firmly to the proper landing attitude.  

# Hard Landing  

When the airplane contacts the ground during landings, its vertical speed is instantly reduced to zero. Unless provisions are made to  slow this vertical speed and cushion the impact of touchdown, the force of contact with the ground could cause structural damage to the  airplane.  

The purpose of pneumatic tires, shock absorbing landing gear, and other devices is to cushion the impact and to increase the time in  which the airplane’s vertical descent is stopped. The importance of this cushion may be understood from the computation that a 6-inch  free fall on landing is roughly equal to a 340 fpm descent. Within a fraction of a second, the airplane gets slowed from this rate of vertical  descent to zero without damage.  

During this time, the landing gear, together with some aid from the lift of the wings, supplies whatever force is needed to counteract the  force of the airplane’s inertia and weight. However, the lift decreases rapidly as the airplane’s forward speed is decreased, and the force  on the landing gear increases by the impact of touchdown. When the descent stops, the lift is practically zero, leaving the landing gear  alone to carry both the airplane’s weight and inertia force. The load imposed at the instant of touchdown may easily be three or four times  the actual weight of the airplane depending on the severity of contact.  

# Touchdown in a Drift or Crab  

At times, it is necessary to correct for wind drift by crabbing on the final approach. If the round out and touchdown are made while the  airplane is drifting or in a crab, it contacts the ground while moving sideways. This imposes extreme side loads on the landing gear and,  if severe enough, may cause structural failure.  

The most effective method to prevent drift is the wing-low method. This technique keeps the longitudinal axis of the airplane aligned with  both the runway and the direction of motion throughout the approach and touchdown. There are three factors that cause the longitudinal  axis and the direction of motion to be misaligned during touchdown: drifting, crabbing, or a combination of both.  

If the pilot does not take adequate corrective action to avoid drift during a crosswind landing, the main wheels’ tire tread offers resistance  to the airplane’s sideward movement with respect to the ground. Consequently, any sideward velocity of the airplane is abruptly  decelerated, as shown in  Figure 9-37 . This creates a moment around the main wheel when it contacts the ground, tending to overturn or  tip the airplane. If the upwind wingtip is raised by the action of this moment, all the weight and shock of landing is borne by one main  wheel. This concentration of forces may cause tire failure or structural damage.

Figure 9-37.  Drifting during touchdown.  

Not only are the same factors present that are attempting to raise a wing, but the crosswind is also acting on the fuselage surface behind  the main wheels, tending to yaw (weathervane) the airplane into the wind. This often results in a ground loop.  

# Ground Loop  

A ground loop is an uncontrolled turn during ground operation that may occur while taxiing or taking off. However, an airplane is  especially vulnerable to this occurrence during the after-landing roll. A ground loop may result if the pilot fails to control an initial  swerve. Drift or weathervaning may cause the initial swerve. Careless use of the rudder, an uneven ground surface, or a soft spot that  retards one main wheel of the airplane may also cause a swerve. In any case, the initial swerve tends to make the airplane ground loop,  whether it is a tailwheel-type or nose-wheel type. [ Figure 9-38 ]  

![](images/5b94de88598f221041926995ae0c81aa106e17f66e84e056a12da7b00ff1c9af.jpg)  
Figure 9-38.  Start of a ground loop.  

Nose-wheel type airplanes are somewhat less prone to ground loop than tailwheel-type airplanes. Since the center of gravity (CG) is  located forward of the main landing gear on these airplanes, any time a swerve develops, centrifugal force acting on the CG tends to  stop the swerving action.  

If the airplane touches down while drifting or in a crab, apply aileron toward the high wing and stop the swerve with the rudder. Brakes  are used to correct for turns or swerves only when the rudder is inadequate. Exercise caution when applying corrective brake action  because it is very easy to over control and aggravate the situation.  

If brakes are used, sufficient brake is applied on the low-wing wheel (outside of the turn) to stop the swerve. When the wings are  approximately level, the new direction should be maintained until the airplane has slowed to taxi speed or has stopped.  

In nose-wheel airplanes, a ground loop is almost always a result of wheelbarrowing. A pilot should be aware that even though the nose- wheel type airplane is less prone than the tailwheel-type airplane, virtually every type of airplane, including large multiengine airplanes,  can be made to ground loop when sufficiently mishandled.  

# Wing Rising After Touchdown  

When landing in a crosswind, there may be instances when a wing rises during the after-landing roll. This may occur whether or not there  is a loss of directional control, depending on the amount of crosswind and the degree of corrective action.  

Any time an airplane is rolling on the ground in a crosswind condition, the upwind wing is receiving a greater force from the wind than  the downwind wing. This causes a lift differential. Also, as the upwind wing rises, there is an increase in the AOA, which increases lift  on the upwind wing, rolling the airplane downwind.  

When the effects of these two factors are great enough, the upwind wing may rise even though directional control is maintained. If no  correction is applied, it is possible that the upwind wing rises sufficiently to cause the downwind wing to strike the ground.  

In the event a wing starts to rise during the landing roll, the pilot should immediately apply more aileron pressure toward the high wing  and continue to maintain direction. The sooner the aileron control is applied, the more effective it is. The further a wing is allowed to  rise before taking corrective action, the more airplane surface is exposed to the force of the crosswind. This diminishes the effectiveness  of the aileron.  

# Hydroplaning  

Hydroplaning is a condition that can exist when an airplane has landed on a runway surface contaminated with standing water, slush,  or wet snow. Hydroplaning can have serious adverse effects on ground controllability and braking efficiency. The three basic types of  hydroplaning are dynamic hydroplaning, reverted rubber hydroplaning, and viscous hydroplaning. Any one of the three can render an  airplane partially or totally uncontrollable anytime during the landing roll.  

# Dynamic Hydroplaning  

Dynamic hydroplaning is a relatively high-speed phenomenon that occurs when there is a film of water on the runway that is at least one- tenth of an inch deep. As the speed of the airplane and the depth of the water increase, the water layer builds up an increasing resistance  to displacement,   resulting in the formation of a wedge of water beneath the tire. At some speed, termed the hydroplaning speed   $\mathrm{(V_{p})}$  ,  the water pressure equals the weight of the airplane, and the tire is lifted off the runway surface. In this condition, the tires no longer  contribute to directional control and braking action is nil.  

Dynamic hydroplaning is related to tire inflation pressure. Data obtained during hydroplaning tests have shown the minimum dynamic  hydroplaning speed   $\mathrm{(V_{p})}$   of a tire to be 8.6 times the square root of the tire pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI). For an airplane  with a main tire pressure of 24 PSI, the calculated hydroplaning speed would be approximately 42 knots. It is important to note that  the calculated speed referred to above is for the start of dynamic hydroplaning. Once hydroplaning has started, it may persist to a  significantly slower speed depending on the type being experienced.  

# Reverted Rubber Hydroplaning  

Reverted rubber (steam) hydroplaning occurs during heavy braking that results in a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film of  water on the runway is required to facilitate this type of hydroplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to cause the rubber in  contact with the runway to revert to its original uncured state. The reverted rubber acts as a seal between the tire and the runway and  delays water exit from the tire footprint area. The water heats and is converted to steam, which supports the tire off the runway.  

Reverted rubber hydroplaning frequently follows an encounter with dynamic hydroplaning, during which time the pilot may have the  brakes locked in an attempt to slow the airplane. Eventually the airplane slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway  surface and the airplane begins to skid. The remedy for this type of hydroplaning is to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up  and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber hydroplaning is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist  to very slow groundspeeds (20 knots or less).  

# Viscous Hydroplaning  

Viscous hydroplaning is due to the viscous properties of water. A thin film of fluid no more than one-thousandth of an inch in depth is all  that is needed. The tire cannot penetrate the fluid and the tire rolls on top of the film. This can occur at a much lower speed than dynamic  hydroplaning, but requires a smooth or smooth acting surface, such as asphalt or a touchdown area coated with the accumulated rubber  from previous landings. Such a surface can have the same friction coefficient as wet ice.  

When confronted with the possibility of hydroplaning, it is best to land on a grooved runway (if available). Touchdown speed should be  as slow as possible consistent with safety. After the nose-wheel is lowered to the runway, moderate braking is applied. If deceleration is  not detected and hydroplaning is suspected, raise the nose and use aerodynamic drag to decelerate to a point where the brakes become  effective.  

Proper braking technique is essential. The brakes are applied firmly until reaching a point just short of a skid. At the first sign of a skid,  release brake pressure and allow the wheels to spin up. Directional control is maintained as far as possible with the rudder. Remember  that in a crosswind, if hydroplaning occurs, the crosswind causes the airplane to simultaneously weathervane into the wind, as well as  slide downwind.  

# Chapter Summary  

Accident statistics show that a pilot is more at risk during the approach and landing than during any other phase of a flight. There are  many factors that contribute to accidents in this phase, but an overwhelming percentage of these accidents result from a lack of pilot  proficiency. This chapter presents procedures that, when learned and practiced correctly, are key to attaining proficiency. Additional  information on aerodynamics, aircraft performance, and other aspects affecting approaches and landings can be found in the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25, as revised). For information concerning risk assessment as a means of  preventing accidents, refer to the Risk Management Handbook (FAA-H-8083-2, as revised).

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 10: Performance Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

Basic flight maneuvers taught to pilots include: straight-and-level, turns, climbs, and descents. As training advances, other  performance   maneuvers   serve to   further   develop   piloting   skills.   Performance   maneuvers   enhance   a pilot’s   proficiency    flight   control  application, maneuver planning, situational awareness, and division of attention. To further that intent, performance maneuver design  allows for the application of flight control pressures, attitudes, airspeeds, and orientations that constantly change throughout the  maneuver.  

Deficiencies during execution of performance maneuvers often occur when a pilot lacks an understanding of fundamental skills or  never mastered them. Performance maneuver training should not take place until the pilot demonstrates consistent competency in the  fundamentals. Further, initial training for performance maneuvers should always begin with a detailed ground lesson for each  maneuver, so that the learner understands the technicalities prior to flight. In addition, performance maneuver training should use  segmented building blocks of instruction so as to allow the pilot an appropriate level of repetition necessary to develop the required  skills.  

Performance maneuvers, once grasped by the pilot, are very satisfying and rewarding. As the pilot develops skills in executing  performance maneuvers, they may likely see an increased smoothness in their flight control application and an increased ability to  sense the airplane’s   attitude and   orientation   without significant conscious   effort.  

# Steep Turns  

Steep turns consist of single to multiple  $360^{\circ}$   and  $720^{\circ}$   turns, in either or both directions, using a bank angle between   $45^{\circ}$   and   $60^{\circ}$  .   The objective of the steep turn is to develop a pilot’s skill in flight control smoothness and coordination, an awareness of the  airplane’s orientation to outside references, division of attention between flight control applications, and the constant need to scan  for hazards and other traffic in the area.  [Figure 10-1]  

![](images/98ed666f56eaf9fafc727988718ec9772f07e29a50e2f5fadefeec9914cdf02b.jpg)  

Figure 10-1.  Steep turns.  

While the fundamental concepts of all turns are the same, when steep turns are first demonstrated and performed, the pilot will be  exposed to:  

1. Higher G-forces  2. The airplane’s   inherent overbanking   tendency   3. Significant loss of the vertical component of lift when the wings are steeply banked  4. Substantial pitch control pressures  5. The need for increased additional power to maintain altitude at a constant airspeed during the turn  

As discussed in previous chapters, when banking an airplane for a level turn, the total lift divides into vertical and horizontal  components of lift. In order to maintain altitude at a constant airspeed, the pilot increases the angle of attack (AOA) to ensure that the  vertical component of lift is sufficient to maintain altitude. The pilot adds power as needed to maintain airspeed. For a steep turn, as  in any level turn, the horizontal component of lift provides the necessary force to turn the airplane. Regardless of the airspeed or  airplane, for a given bank angle in a level altitude turn, the same load factor will always be produced. The load factor is the vector  addition of gravity and centrifugal force. When the bank becomes steep as in a level altitude  $45^{\circ}$   banked turn, the resulting load factor  is 1.41. In a level altitude   $60^{\circ}$   banked turn, the resulting load factor is 2.0. To put this in perspective, with a load factor of 2.0, the  effective weight of the aircraft (and its occupants) doubles. Pilots may have difficulty with orientation and movement when first  experiencing these forces. Pilots should also understand that load factors increase dramatically during a level turn beyond   $60^{\circ}$   of  bank. Note that the design of a standard category general aviation airplane accommodates a load factor up to 3.8. A level turn using   $75^{\circ}$   of bank exceeds that limit.  

Because of higher load factors, steep turns should be performed at an airspeed that does not exceed the airplane’s design maneuvering  speed   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$   or operating maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{O})}$  . Maximum turning performance for a given speed is accomplished when an  airplane has a high   angle of   bank.   Each   airplane’s   level turning   performance    limited   by   structural and   aerodynamic design,   as well  as available   power.   The   airplane’s   limiting   load   factor   determines   the   maximum   bank   angle   that   can   be   maintained   in   level   flight  without   exceeding   the   airplane’s   structural   limitations   or   stalling.   As   the   load   factor   increases,   so   does   the   stalling   speed. For  example, if an airplane stalls in level flight at 50 knots, it will stall at 60 knots in a   $45^{\circ}$   steep turn while maintaining altitude. It will  stall at 70 knots if the bank is increased to   $60^{\circ}$  . Stalling speed increases at the square root of the load factor. As the bank angle  increases in level flight, the margin between stalling speed and maneuvering speed decreases. At speeds at or below   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  , the  airplane will stall before exceeding the design load limit.  

In   addition   to   the increased   load   factors,   the airplane will exhibit what is   called   “overbanking   tendency” as previously   discussed in  Chapter 3, Basic Flight Maneuvers. In most flight maneuvers, bank angles are shallow enough that the airplane exhibits positive or  neutral stability about the longitudinal axis. However, as bank angles steepen, the airplane will continue rolling in the direction of the  bank unless deliberate and opposite aileron pressure is held. Pilots should also be mindful of the various left-turning tendencies, such  as P-factor, which require effective rudder/aileron coordination. While performing a steep turn, a significant component of yaw is  experienced as motion away from and toward the earth's surface, which may seem confusing when first experienced.  

Before starting any practice maneuver, the pilot ensures that the area is clear of air traffic and other hazards. Further, distant  references should be chosen to allow the pilot to assess when to begin rollout from the turn. After establishing the manufacturer’s  recommended entry speed,   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$  , or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  , as applicable, the airplane should be smoothly rolled into a predetermined bank angle  between   $45^{\circ}$   and   $60^{\circ}$  . As the bank angle is being established, generally prior to   $30^{\circ}$   of bank, elevator back pressure should be  smoothly applied to increase the AOA and power should be added. Pilots should keep in mind that as the AOA increases, so does  drag, and additional power allows the airplane to maintain airspeed. After the selected bank angle has been reached, the pilot will find  that considerable force is required on the elevator control to hold the airplane in level flight.  

The certification testing standards do not specify trim requirements for a steep turn. The decision whether to use trim depends on the  airplane characteristics, speed of the trim system, and preference of the instructor and learner. As the bank angle transitions from  medium to steep, increasing elevator-up trim and smoothly increasing engine power to that required for the turn removes some or all  of the control forces required to maintain a higher angle of attack. However, if trim is used, pilots should not forget to remove both  the trim and power inputs as the maneuver is completed.  

Maintaining bank angle, altitude, and orientation requires an awareness of the relative position of the horizon to the nose and the  wings.   The   pilot   who   references   the   aircraft’s   attitude   by   observing   only   the   nose   will   have   difficulty   maintaining   altitude.   A pilot  who observes both the nose and the wings relative to the horizon is likely able to maintain altitude within performance standards.  Altitude deviations are primary errors exhibited in the execution of steep turns.  Minor corrections for pitch attitude are accomplished  with proportional elevator back pressure while the bank angle is held constant with the ailerons. However, during steep turns, it is not  uncommon for a pilot to allow the nose to get excessively low resulting in a significant loss in altitude in a very short period of time.  The pilot can  recover from such an altitude loss by first reducing the angle of bank with coordinated use of opposite aileron and  rudder and then increasing the pitch attitude by increasing elevator back pressure.  Attempting to recover from an excessively nose- low, steep bank condition by using only the elevator causes a steepening of the bank and puts unnecessary stress on the airplane.  

The rollout from the steep turn should be timed so that the wings reach level flight when the airplane is on the heading from which the  maneuver was started. A good rule of thumb is to begin the rollout at ½ the number of degrees of bank prior to reaching the  terminating heading. For example, if a right steep turn was begun on a heading of   $270^{\circ}$   and if the bank angle is   $60^{\circ}$  , the pilot should  begin the rollout   $30^{\circ}$   prior or at a heading of   $240^{\circ}$  . While the rollout is being made, elevator back pressure, trim (if used), and power  should be gradually reduced, as necessary, to maintain the altitude and airspeed.  

Common errors when performing steep turns are:  

1. Not clearing the area  2. Inadequate pitch control on entry or rollout  3. Gaining or losing altitude  4. Failure to maintain constant bank angle  5. Poor flight control coordination  6. Ineffective use of trim  7. Ineffective use of power  8. Inadequate airspeed control  9. Becoming disoriented  10. Performing by reference to the flight instruments rather than visual references  11. Failure to scan for other traffic during the maneuver  12. Attempting to start recovery prematurely  13. Failure to stop the turn on the designated heading  

# Steep Spiral  

The objective of the steep spiral is to provide a flight maneuver for rapidly dissipating substantial amounts of altitude while remaining  over a selected spot. This maneuver may be useful during an emergency landing. A steep spiral is a gliding turn wherein the pilot  maintains a constant radius around a surface-based reference point—similar to the turns around a point maneuver, but in this case the  airplane is rapidly descending. The maneuver consists of the completion of at least three   $360^{\circ}$   turns   [Figure 10-2],  and should begin  at sufficient altitude such that the maneuver concludes no lower than 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL). Note that while there are  similarities between a steep spiral and an emergency descent, the reasons for using the two maneuvers may differ, and the airspeed  and configuration are usually different.  

![](images/bc61bd8e9c726d5bee599238a6d4c6816bb57b8c023ae0ae732670899ef0b602.jpg)  

Figure 10-2.  Steep spiral.  

The steep spiral is initiated by properly clearing the airspace for air traffic and hazards. In general, the throttle is closed to idle,  carburetor heat is applied if equipped, and gliding speed is established. Once the proper airspeed is attained, the pitch should be  lowered and the airplane rolled to the desired bank angle as the reference point is reached. The pilot should consider the distance  from the reference point since that establishes the turning radius, and the steepest bank should not exceed   $60^{\circ}$  . The gliding spiral  should   be a turn   of   constant radius   while maintaining   the airplane’s   position   relative to   the reference.   This   can   only   be accomplished  by proper correction for wind drift by steepening the bank on downwind headings and shallowing the bank on upwind headings.  During the steep spiral, the pilot should continually correct for any changes in wind direction and velocity to maintain a constant  radius.  

Operating the engine at idle speed for any prolonged period during the glide may result in excessive engine cooling, spark plug  fouling, or carburetor ice. To assist in avoiding these issues, the throttle should be periodically advanced and sustained for a few  seconds. Monitoring cylinder head temperature gauges, if available, provides a pilot with additional information on engine cooling.  When advancing the throttle, the pitch attitude should be adjusted to maintain a constant airspeed and, preferably, this should be done  when headed into the wind.  

Maintaining a constant airspeed throughout the maneuver is an important skill for a pilot to develop. This is necessary because the  airspeed tends to fluctuate as the bank angle is changed throughout the maneuver. The pilot should anticipate pitch corrections as the  bank angle is varied throughout the maneuver. During practice of the maneuver, the pilot should execute at least three turns and roll  out toward a definite object or on a specific heading. To make the exercise more challenging, the pilot rolls out on a heading  perpendicular to or directly into the wind rather toward a specific object. This ability would be a particularly useful skill in the event  of an actual emergency. In addition, noting the altitude lost during each revolution would help the pilot determine when to roll out in  an actual emergency so as not to be too high or too low to make a safe approach. During rollout, the smooth and accurate application  of the flight controls allow the airplane to recover to a wings-level glide with no change in airspeed. Recovering to normal cruise  flight would proceed after the establishment of a wings-level glide.  

Common errors when performing steep spirals are:  

1. Not clearing the area  2. Inadequate pitch control on entry or rollout  3. Not correcting the bank angle to compensate for wind  4. Poor flight control coordination  5. Ineffective use of trim  6. Inadequate airspeed control  7. Becoming disoriented  8. Performing by reference to the flight instruments rather than visual references  9. Not scanning for other traffic during the maneuver  10. Not completing the turn on the designated heading or reference  

# Chandelle  

A chandelle is a maximum performance,   $180^{\circ}$   climbing turn that begins from approximately straight-and-level flight and concludes  with the airplane in a wings-level, nose-high attitude just above stall speed.  [Figure 10-3]  The goal is to gain the most altitude  possible for a given bank angle and power setting; however, the standard used to judge the maneuver is not the amount of altitude  gained,   but rather   the pilot’s   proficiency   as it pertains   to   maximizing   climb   performance   for   the power   and   bank   selected,   as   well as  the skill demonstrated.  

A chandelle is best described in two specific phases: the first  $90^{\circ}$   of turn and the second   $90^{\circ}$   of turn. The first  $90^{\circ}$   of turn is described  as constant bank and continuously increasing pitch; and the second   $90^{\circ}$   as constant pitch and continuously decreasing bank. During  the first   $90^{\circ}$  , the pilot will set the bank angle, increase power, and increase pitch attitude at a rate such that maximum pitch-up occurs  at the completion of the first   $90^{\circ}$  . The maximum pitch-up attitude achieved at the   $90^{\circ}$   mark is held for the remainder of the maneuver.  If   the pitch   attitude is   set too   low,   the airplane’s   airspeed   will never   decrease to   just above stall speed.    the pitch   attitude is set too  high, the airplane may aerodynamically stall prior to completion of the maneuver. Starting at the  $90^{\circ}$   point, and while maintaining the  pitch attitude set at the end of the first   $90^{\circ}$  , the pilot begins a slow and coordinated constant rate rollout so as to have the wings level  when the airplane is at the   $180^{\circ}$   point. If the rate of rollout is too rapid or sluggish, the airplane either exceeds the   $180^{\circ}$   turn or does  not complete the turn as the wings come level to the horizon.  

![](images/0e4e221af600b407165141a17981657ee34d522eb2e9ac1895ff6422f8055ed0.jpg)  
Figure 10-3.  Chandelle.  

Prior to starting the chandelle, the flaps and landing gear (if retractable) should be in the UP position. The chandelle is initiated by  properly clearing the airspace for air traffic and hazards. The maneuver should be entered from straight-and-level flight or a shallow  dive at an airspeed recommended by the manufacturer—in many cases this is the airplane’s design maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$   or  operating maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{O})}$  .  [Figure 10-3A]  After the appropriate entry airspeed has been established, the chandelle is started  by smoothly entering a coordinated turn to the desired angle of bank. Once the bank angle is established, which is generally   $30^{\circ}$  ,   a  climbing turn should be started by smoothly applying elevator back pressure at a constant rate while simultaneously increasing engine  power to the recommended setting. In airplanes with a fixed-pitch propeller, the throttle should be set so as to not exceed rotations per  minute (rpm) limitations. In airplanes with constant-speed propellers, power may be set at the normal cruise or climb setting as  appropriate.  [Figure 10-3B]  

As airspeed decreases during the chandelle, left-turning tendencies, such as P-factor, have greater effect. As airspeed decreases, right  rudder pressure is progressively increased to ensure that the airplane remains in coordinated flight. The pilot maintains coordinated  flight by sensing physical slipping or skidding, by glancing at the ball in the turn-and-slip or turn coordinator, and by using  appropriate control pressures.  

At the   $90°$   point, the pilot should   begin    smoothly   roll out of   the bank   at a constant rate while maintaining   the pitch   attitude attained  at the   end   of   the   first    $90°$  .   While   the   angle   of   bank    fixed   during   the   first    $90°$  ,   recall   that   as airspeed   decreases,   the   overbanking  tendency increases.  [Figure   $I O–3C J$  As a result, proper use of the ailerons allows the bank to remain at a fixed angle until rollout is  begun   at the start of   the final   $90°$  . As   the rollout continues, the vertical component of   lift increases. However,   as speed   continues to  decrease, a slight increase of elevator back pressure is required to keep the pitch attitude from decreasing.  

When the airspeed is slowest, near the completion of the chandelle, right rudder pressure is significant, especially when rolling out  from a left chandelle due to left adverse yaw and left-turning tendencies, such as P-factor.  [Figure 10-3D]  When rolling out from a  right chandelle, the yawing moment is to the right, which partially cancels some of the left-turning   tendency’s   effect. Depending   on   the airplane, either very little left rudder or a reduction in right rudder pressure is required during the rollout from a right chandelle.  At   the   completion   of    $180^{\circ}$    of   turn,   the   wings   should   be   level   to   the   horizon,   the   airspeed   should   be   just   above   the   power-on stall  speed,   and   the airplane’s   pitch-high attitude should be held momentarily.  [Figure 10-3E]  

Once the airplane is in controlled flight, the pitch attitude may be reduced and the airplane returned to straight-and-level cruise flight.  

Common errors when performing chandelles are:  

1. Not clearing the area  2. Initial bank is too shallow resulting in a stall  3. Initial bank is too steep resulting in failure to gain maximum performance  4. Allowing the bank angle to increase after initial establishment  5. Not starting the recovery at the  $90^{\circ}$   point in the turn  6. Allowing the pitch attitude to increase as the bank is rolled out during the second 90° of turn  7. Leveling the wings prior to the   $180^{\circ}$   point being reached  8. Pitch attitude is low on recovery resulting in airspeed well above stall speed  9. Application of flight control pressures is not smooth  10. Poor flight control coordination  11. Stalling at any point during the maneuver  12. Execution of a steep turn instead of a climbing maneuver  13. Not scanning for other traffic during the maneuver  14. Performing by reference to the instruments rather than visual references  

# Lazy Eight  

The lazy eight is a maneuver that is designed to develop the proper coordination of the flight controls across a wide range of  airspeeds and attitudes. It is the only standard flight training maneuver in which flight control pressures are constantly changing. In an  attempt to simplify the discussion about this maneuver, the lazy eight can be loosely compared to the ground reference maneuver, S- turns across the road. Recall that S-turns across the road are made of opposing   $180^{\circ}$   turns. For example, first a   $180^{\circ}$   turn to the right,  followed immediately by a   $180^{\circ}$   turn to the left. The lazy eight adds both a climb and descent to each   $180^{\circ}$   segment. The first   $90^{\circ}$   is a  climb; the second 90° is a descent.  [Figure 10-4]  

![](images/c04a2a082bdfa3f62541b7915a63456f394580e785a0d85dc044fab610824cbc.jpg)  
Figure 10-4.  Lazy eight.  

The previous description of a lazy eight and  figure 10-4  describe how a lazy eight looks from outside the flight deck and describes it  as two   $180^{\circ}$   turns with altitude changes. How does it look from the pilot's perspective? Think of the longitudinal axis of the airplane  as a pencil, which draws on whatever it points to. During this maneuver, the longitudinal axis of the airplane traces a symmetrical  eight on its side with segments of the eight above and below the horizon, and it takes both   $180^{\circ}$   turns to form both loops of an eight.  The first  $90^{\circ}$   of the first   $180^{\circ}$   turn traces the upper portion of one of the loops. The second 90° portion of the second   $180^{\circ}$   turn traces  the lower portion of that loop at the end of the maneuvuer. The second   $90^{\circ}$   of the first   $180^{\circ}$   turn and the first   $90^{\circ}$   of the second   $180^{\circ}$    turn complete the other loop of the eight. The sensation of using the airplane to slowly draw this symbol gives the maneuver its name.  

To   aid   in   the performance   of   the lazy   eight’s   symmetrical climbing/descending   turns,   the pilot selects   prominent reference   points on  the natural horizon. The reference points selected should be at   $45^{\circ}$  ,  $90^{\circ}$  , and   $135^{\circ}$   from the direction in which the maneuver is started  for each   $180^{\circ}$   turn. With the general concept of climbing and descending turns grasped, specifics of the lazy eight can then be  discussed.  

Shown in  Figure 10-4A , from level flight a gradual climbing turn is begun in the direction of the   $45^{\circ}$   reference point. The climbing  turn should be planned and controlled so that the maximum pitch-up attitude is reached at the   $45^{\circ}$   point with an approximate bank  angle of   $15^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 10-4B]  As the pitch attitude is raised, the airspeed decreases, which causes the rate of turn to increase. As such,  the lazy eight should begin with a slow rate of roll as the combination of increasing pitch and increasing bank may cause the rate of  turn to be so rapid that the  $45^{\circ}$   reference point will be reached before the highest pitch attitude is attained. At the   $45^{\circ}$   reference point,  the pitch attitude should be at the maximum pitch-up selected for the maneuver while the bank angle is slowly increasing. Beyond the   $45^{\circ}$   reference point, the pitch-up attitude should begin to decrease slowly toward the horizon until the   $90^{\circ}$   reference point is reached  where the pitch attitude passes through level.  

The lazy eight requires substantial skill in coordinating the aileron and rudder; therefore, some discussion about coordination is  warranted. As pilots understand, the purpose of the rudder is to maintain coordination; slipping or skidding is to be avoided. Pilots  should remember that since the airspeed is still decreasing as the airplane is climbing; additional right rudder pressure should be  applied to counteract left-turning tendencies, such as P-factor. As the airspeed decreases, right rudder pressure should be gradually  applied to counteract yaw at the apex of the lazy eight in both the right and left turns; however, additional right rudder pressure is  required when using right aileron control pressure. When displacing the ailerons for more lift on the left wing, left adverse yaw  augments with the left-yawing P-factor in an attempt to yaw the nose to the left. In contrast, in left climbing turns or rolling to the left,  the left yawing P-factor tends to cancel the effects of adverse yaw to the right; consequently, less right rudder pressure is required.  These concepts can be difficult to remember; however, to simplify, rolling right at low airspeeds and high-power settings requires  substantial right rudder pressures.  

At   the   lazy   eight’s    $90°$    reference   point, the bank   angle should   also   have reached   its   maximum   angle of    approximately    $30^{\circ}$  .   [Figure  10-4C]  The airspeed   should   be at its   minimum,   just about 5   to   10   knots   above stall speed,   with   the airplane’s   pitch   attitude passing   through level flight. Coordinated flight at this point requires that, in some flight conditions, a slight amount of opposite aileron  pressure may be required to prevent the wings from overbanking while maintaining rudder pressure to cancel the effects of left- turning tendencies.  

The pilot should not hesitate at the   $90°$   point but should continue to maneuver the airplane into a descending turn. The rollout from  the   bank   should   proceed   slowly   while   the   airplane’s   pitch   attitude    allowed   to   decrease.   When   the   airplane   has   turned    $135^{\circ}$  ,   the  airplane should be in its lowest pitch attitude.  [Figure   $I O–4D J$  Pilots   should   remember   that the airplane’s   airspeed    increasing   as the  airplane’s   pitch   attitude decreases; therefore,   maintaining   proper   coordination   will require a decrease in   right rudder   pressure. As the  airplane approaches the   $180^{\circ}$   point, it is necessary to progressively relax rudder and aileron pressure while simultaneously raising  pitch and roll to level flight. As the rollout is being accomplished, the pilot should note the amount of turn remaining and adjust the  rate of rollout and pitch change so that the wings and nose are level at the original airspeed just as the   $180^{\circ}$   point is reached.  

Upon arriving at   $180^{\circ}$   point, a climbing turn should be started immediately in the opposite direction toward the preselected reference  points to complete the second half of the lazy eight in the same manner as the first half.  [Figure 10-4E]  

Power should be set so as not to enter the maneuver at an airspeed that would exceed manufacturer’s recommendations, which is   generally no greater than   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{O}}$  . Power and bank angle have significant effect on the altitude gained or lost; if excess power is  used for a given bank angle, altitude is gained at the completion of the maneuver; however, if insufficient power is used for a given  bank angle, altitude is lost.  

Common errors when performing lazy eights are:  

1. Not clearing the area  2. Maneuver is not symmetrical across each   $180^{\circ}$    3. Inadequate or improper selection or use of    $45^{\circ}$  ,  $90^{\circ}$  ,   $135^{\circ}$   references  4. Ineffective planning  5. Gain or loss of altitude at each   $180^{\circ}$   point  6. Poor control at the top of each climb segment resulting in the pitch rapidly falling through the horizon  7. Airspeed or bank angle standards not met  8. Control roughness  9. Poor flight control coordination  10. Stalling at any point during the maneuver  11. Execution of a steep turn instead of a climbing maneuver  12. Not scanning for other traffic during the maneuver  13. Performing by reference to the flight instruments rather than visual references  

# Chapter Summary  

Performance   maneuvers   are used   to   develop   a pilot’s   skills   in   coordinating   the flight control’s   use and   effect while enhancing the  pilot’s   ability   to   divide attention   across   the various   demands   of   flight. Performance   maneuvers   are also   designed   to   further   develop a  pilot’s   application   and   correlation   of   the fundamentals   of   flight and   integrate developing   skills   into   advanced   maneuvers.   Developing  highly-honed skills in performance maneuvers allows the pilot to effectively progress toward the mastery of flight. Mastery is  developed as the mechanics of flight become a subconscious, rather than a conscious, application of the flight controls to maneuver  the airplane in attitude, orientation, and position.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 11: Night Operations  

# Introduction  

The mechanical operation of an airplane at night is no different than operating the same airplane during the day. The airplane does not  know if it is being operated in the dark or in bright sunlight. It performs and responds to control inputs by the pilot. The  pilot, however, is affected by various aspects of night operations and should take them into consideration during night flight  operations. Some are actual physical limitations affecting all pilots. Others, such as equipment requirements, procedures, and  emergency situations, should also be considered.  

According to 14 CFR part 1, section   1.1, Definitions and Abbreviations, “night” means the time between the end of evening civil  twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time. To explain further, the  National Weather Service defines evening civil twilight as the time that begins in the morning, or ends in the evening, when the  geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon. Therefore, morning civil twilight begins when the geometric center of the  sun is 6 degrees below the horizon, and ends at sunrise. Evening civil twilight begins at sunset and ends when the geometric center of  the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon. The FAA has an  online tool   to calculate sunrise, sunset, and civil twilight for any given  location.  

For 14 CFR part 61, section 61.57(b)(1) night operations that meet recent flight experience requirements, the term “night” refers to  the time period beginning 1 hour after sunset and ending 1 hour before sunrise. The same regulation requires that during those hours,  no person may act as pilot-in-command (PIC) of an aircraft carrying passengers unless within the preceding 90 days and during those  specified hours, that person has made 3 takeoffs and landings to a full stop. 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.57(b)(1)(i) and (ii) require the  pilot to have made the required takeoffs and landings acting as the sole manipulator of the controls, and to have performed the  takeoffs and landings in an aircraft of the same category, class, and type (if a type rating is required). Other conditions apply if using a  full flight simulator to meet the requirement as described in 14 CFR part 61 (section 61.57(b)(2)) or if seeking to use another  alternative provided in the regulation.  

Night flying operations should not be encouraged or attempted except by certificated pilots with knowledge of and experience in  the topics discussed in this chapter.  

# Night Vision  

Due   to   the   physiology   of   the   eye   [Figure   11-1],   humans   experience   diminished   vision   in   low-light   conditions.   Because   vision  involves   the   eyes   and   brain   working   together,   understanding   eye   function   leads   to   pilot   behaviors   that   can   improve   night   vision  significantly.  

# Anatomy of the Eye  

⦁  Light from an object enters the eye through the cornea and then continues through the pupil.  

⦁  The opening   (dilation)   and   closing   (constriction)   of   the pupil is   controlled   by   the iris,   which    the colored     part of the eye. The function of the pupil is similar to that of the diaphragm of a photographic camera: to   control the amount of light.  

⦁  The lens    located   behind   the pupil and   its   function     focus   light on   the surface of   the retina.  

⦁  The retina is   the inner   layer   of   the eyeball that contains   photosensitive cells   called   rods   and   cones. The       function   of   the retina is   similar    that of   the film    a photographic camera: to   record   an   image.  

⦁  The cones are located    higher   concentrations   than   rods    the central area   of   the retina known   as the       macula,   which   measures about 4.5  $4.5\;\mathrm{mm}$     diameter.   The exact center   of   the macula has a   very   small       depression   called   the fovea,   which   contains   cones only.   The cones are used   for   day   or   high-intensity   light       vision.   They   are involved   with   central vision    detect detail,   perceive color,   and   identify   far-away   objects.  

⦁  The rods   are located   mainly    the periphery   of   the retina—an   area   that is   about 10,000   times more        sensitive to   light than   the fovea.   Rods   are used   for   low   light intensity   or   night vision   and   are involved   with        peripheral vision    detect position   references,   including   objects   (fixed   and   moving)    shades of   gray,   but        cannot be used    detect detail or    perceive color.  

⦁  Although   there is   not a   clear-cut division   of   function,   the rods   make night vision   possible.   The rods   and       cones function    daylight and    moonlight, but in   the absence   of   normal light, the process   of   night vision        placed   almost entirely   on   the rods.  

⦁  Light energy   (an   image)   enters   the eyes and    transformed   by   the cones and   rods   into   electrical signals that     are carried   by   the optic nerve to   the posterior   area   of   the brain   (occipital lobes).   This   part of   the brain       interprets the electrical signals and   creates a mental image of   the actual object that was seen   by   the person.

# Types of Vision  

Photopic Vision .   During   daytime or   high-intensity   artificial illumination   conditions,   the eyes rely   on   central vision   (foveal cones) to   perceive and   interpret sharp   images and   color   of   objects.   [Figure 11-2]  

![](images/8dba79cd5f6a9526b3fc8669f11ee9a074baa3938ddc048f43430ee776caf88a.jpg)  
Figure 11-2.  Central Vision.  

Mesopic Vision .   Occurs   at dawn,   dusk,   or   under   full moonlight levels and   is   characterized   by   decreasing   visual acuity   and   color vision.   Under   these conditions,   a combination   of   central (foveal cones) and   peripheral (rods)vision    required    maintain   appropriate  visual performance.  

Scotopic Vision .   During   nighttime,   partial moonlight, or   low   intensity   artificial illumination   conditions,   central vision   (foveal cones)  becomes ineffective to   maintain   visual acuity   and   color   perception.   Under   these conditions,    looking   directly   at an   object for   more  than   a few   seconds,   the image of   the object fades away   completely   (night blind   spot).   Peripheral vision   (off   center   scanning)   provides  the only   means   of   seeing   very   dim   objects    the dark.  

# Night Blind Spot  

The “Night Blind   Spot”   appears   under   conditions   of   low   ambient illumination   due to   the absence   of   rods    the fovea.   [Figure 11-3]  This   absence   of   rods   affects   the central 5   to   10   degrees   of   the visual field.   If   an   object is   viewed   directly   at night, it may   go undetected   or   it may   fade away   after   initial detection.   T he night blind   spot can   hide larger   objects   as the distance   between   the pilot  and   an   object increases.

Figure 11-3.  The night blind spot.  

# Vision Under Dim and Bright Illumination  

The eye’s   adaptation   to   darkness   is   another   important aspect of   night vision.   When   a dark   room   is   entered,   it is   difficult to   see anything   until the eyes become adjusted    the darkness.   Almost everyone experiences   this   when   entering   a darkened   movie theater.  

In   darkness,   vision   gradually   becomes more sensitive to   light. Maximum   dark   adaptation   can   take up   to   30   minutes. Exposure to   aircraft anti-collision   lights   does not impair   night vision   adaptation   because the intermittent flashes have a very   short duration   (less   than    second).   However,    dark-adapted   eyes are exposed   to   a bright light source   (searchlights,   landing   lights,   flares, etc.)   for   a  period   of    second   or   more,   night vision    temporarily   impaired.    it is   safe to   do   so,   pilots   may   close one eye when   bright exposure  begins    order    preserve dark   adaptation   for   that eye.  

# Factors Affecting Vision  

⦁  During   the day,   identification   of   objects   at a distance    aided   by   good   resolution.   At night, the     identification   range of   dim   objects    limited   and   the detail resolution    poor.  

⦁  Surface references   or   the horizon   may   become obscured   by   smoke,   fog,   smog,   haze,   dust, ice particles,       or   other   phenomena,   even   when   visibility   meets   Visual Flight Rule (VFR)   minimums.   This    especially   true     at airports   located   adjacent to   large bodies of   water   or   sparsely   populated   areas   where few,    any,   surface       references   are available.   Lack   of   horizon   or   surface reference    common   on   over-water   flights,   at night,       and    low-visibility   conditions.  

⦁  Presence   of   uncorrected   refractive eye disorders   such   as myopia (nearsightedness–impaired   focusing   of       distant objects),   hyperopia (farsightedness–impaired   focusing   of   near   objects),   astigmatism   (impaired       focusing   of   objects    different meridians),   or   presbyopia (impaired   focusing   of   near   objects)   affect day       and   night vision.   ⦁  Self-imposed   stresses such   as self-medication,   alcohol consumption   (including   hangover   effects),   tobacco       use (including   withdrawal),   hypoglycemia,   sleep   deprivation/fatigue,   and   extreme emotional upset can       seriously   impair   vision.   ⦁  Inflight exposure to   low   barometric pressure without the use of   supplemental oxygen   (above 10,000   feet       during   the day   and   above 5,000   feet at night)   can   result in   hypoxia,   which   impairs   visual performance.   ⦁  Due to   the effects   of   carbon   monoxide on   the blood,   smokers   may   experience   a physiological altitude that        much   higher   than   actual altitude.   The smoker    thus   more susceptible to   hypoxia at lower   altitudes than       the nonsmoker.   ⦁  Other   factors   that may   have an   adverse effect on   visual performance   include windscreen   haze,   improper       illumination   of   the flight deck   and/or   instruments,   scratched   and/or   dirty   instrumentation,   use of   flight deck       red   lighting,   inadequate flight deck   environmental control (temperature and   humidity),   inappropriate       sunglasses and/or   prescription   glasses/contact lenses, and   sustained   visual workload   during   flight.  Red   light       illumination   distorts   colors   (magenta and   yellow   pigments   both   appear   as red,   and   cyan   pigment appears       black)   on   aeronautical charts.   Pilots   should   use it only   where optimum   outside night vision   capability        necessary.   Dim   white flight deck   lighting   should   be available when   needed   for   map   and   instrument reading.   ⦁  Monovision   contact lenses (one contact lens   for   distant vision   and   the other   lens   for   near   vision)   make the   pilot alternate his/her vision; that is, a person uses one eye at a time, suppressing the other, and       consequently impairs binocular vision and depth perception. The FAA recommends not using these lenses  when piloting an aircraft..   ⦁  A   flickering   light in   the flight deck,   anti-collision   lights,   or   other   aircraft lights,   may   cause interference       with   brain   function.   Although   rare,   this   may   occur   at a frequencies from     20   hertz.    continuous,   the       possible physical reactions   can   be nausea,   dizziness,   grogginess,   unconsciousness,   headaches, or   confusion.       Pilots   should   try    eliminate or   screen   out any   light source   that might cause an   unwanted   reaction   to       blinking   or   flickering   lights.  

⦁  Sunglasses can   aid   the dark   adaptation   process,   which    delayed   by   prolonged   exposure to   bright sunlight.  

# Night Illusions  

Visual illusions   are especially   hazardous   because pilots   rely   on   their   eyes for   correct information.   Darkness   or   low   visibility   increases  pilot susceptibility   to   error.   Two   illusions   that lead   to   spatial disorientation,   false horizon   and   autokinesis,   concern   the visual system   only.  

# False Horizon  

Flying   at night under   clear   skies with   ground   lights   below   can   result in   situations   where it is   difficult to   distinguish   the ground   lights   from   the stars.   A   dark   scene spread   with   ground   lights   and   stars,   and   certain   geometric patterns   of   ground   lights   can   provide   inaccurate visual information,   making   it difficult to   align   the aircraft correctly   with   the actual horizon.   An   aurora borealis   display   at  night or   a visible sloping   cloud   formation   can   also   affect a pilot's   sense of   the horizon.   A   similar   problem    encountered   during   certain   daylight operations   over   large bodies of   water.   Various   atmospheric and   water   conditions   can   create a visual scene without a  discernible horizon.  

# Autokinesis  

In   the dark,   a stationary   light will appear   to   move about when   stared   at for   many   seconds.   The disoriented   pilot could   lose control of   the aircraft in   attempting    align   it with   the false movements   of   this   light.  

# Featureless Terrain Illusion  

A   black-hole approach   occurs   when   the landing    made from   over   water   or   non-lighted   terrain   where the runway   lights   are the only   source   of   light. Without peripheral visual cues to   help,   orientation    difficult. The runway   can   seem   out of   position   (down-sloping   or   up-sloping)   and    the worst case,   results    landing   short of   the runway.    an   electronic glide slope or   visual approach   slope indicator   (VASI)    available,   it should   be   used.    navigation   aids   (NAVAIDs)   are   unavailable,   the   flight   instruments   assist   in   maintaining   orientation   and   a normal approach.   Anytime position   in   relation   to   the runway   or   altitude is   in   doubt, the pilot should   execute a go- around.  

Bright runway   and   approach   lighting   systems,   especially   where few   lights   illuminate the surrounding   terrain,   may   create the illusion   of   being   lower   or   having   less   distance   to   the   runway.   In   this   situation,   the   tendency    to   fly   a higher   approach.   Also,   flying   over   terrain   with   only   a few   lights   makes the runway   recede or   appear   farther   away.   With   this   situation,   the tendency     fly    lower-than­ normal   approach.    the   runway   has   a city   in   the   distance   on   higher   terrain,   the   tendency    to   fly   a lower-than-normal   approach.    good   review   of   the airfield   layout and   boundaries before initiating   any   approach   helps   maintain   a safe approach   angle.  

# Ground Lighting Illusions  

Lights   along   a straight path,   such   as a road   or   lights   on   moving   trains,   can   be mistaken   for   runway   and   approach   lights.   Bright runway and   approach   lighting   systems,   especially   where few   lights   illuminate the surrounding   terrain,   may   create the illusion   of   less   distance to   the runway.   The pilot who   does not recognize this   illusion   will often   fly   a higher   approach.  

Illusions   created   by   runway   lights   result in   a variety   of   problems.   Bright lights   or   bold   colors   advance   the runway,   making   it appear   closer.   Night   landings   are   further   complicated   by   the   difficulty   of   judging   distance   and   the   possibility   of   confusing   approach   and   runway   lights.   For   example,   when   a double row   of   approach   lights   joins   the boundary   lights   of   the runway,   there can   be confusion   as  to   where the approach   lights   terminate and   runway   lights   begin.   Under   certain   conditions,   approach   lights   can   make the aircraft seem   higher    a turn    final,   than   when   its   wings   are level.  

# Pilot Equipment  

As   part   of   preflight   preparation,   pilots   should   carefully   consider   the   personal   equipment   that   should   be   readily   available   during   the  flight to include a flashlight, aeronautical charts, pertinent data for the flight, and a flight deck checklist containing procedures for the  following tasks:  

1.   Before starting   engines 2.   Before takeoff   3.   Cruise   4.   Before landing   5.   After   landing   6.   Stopping   engines   7.   Emergencies  

At   least one   reliable   flashlight    recommended   as standard   equipment   on   all night   flights.    reliable   incandescent   or   light-emitting   diode   (LED)   dimmable   flashlight   able   to   produce   white/red   light    preferable.   The   flashlight   should   be   large   enough   to   be   easily   located   in   the event it is   needed.   It is   also   recommended   to   have a spare set of   batteries for   the flashlight readily   available.   The white  light   is   used   while   performing   the   preflight   visual   inspection   of   the   airplane,   the   red   light   is   used   when   performing   flight   deck   operations,   and   the dim   white light may   be used   for   chart reading.   Many   charts   can   be displayed   on   a EFB,   which   does not require a  flashlight. However,   its   brightness   should   be set so   as not to   seriously   impair   night vision.  

Since   the red   light is   non-glaring,   it will not impair   night vision.   Some pilots   prefer   two   flashlights,   one with   a white light for   preflight  and   the   other   a penlight   type   with   a red   light.   The   latter   can   be   suspended   by   a string   from   around   the   neck   to   ensure   the   light    always   readily   available.   As   mentioned   earlier,   red   light distorts   color   perception   of   pigments   other   than   red   on   charts.  

Aeronautical   charts   are   essential   for   night   cross-country   flight   and,    the   intended   course    near   the   edge   of   the chart, the adjacent  chart should   also   be available.   The lights   of   cities and   towns   can   be seen   at surprising   distances   at night, and    this   adjacent chart is   not   available   to   identify   those   landmarks,   confusion   could   result.   Regardless   of   the   equipment   used,   organization   of   the   flight   deck   eases the burden   and   enhances   safety.   Organize equipment and   charts   and   place   them   within   easy   reach   prior    taxiing.  

# Airplane Equipment and Lighting  

14 CFR part 91, section 91.205(c) specifies the basic minimum airplane equipment that is required for VFR flight at night. This  equipment includes basic instruments, lights, electrical energy source, and spare fuses if applicable.  

The standard instruments required by 14 CFR part 91, section 91.205(d) for IFR flight are valuable assets for aircraft control at night.  14 CFR part 91, section 91.205(c)(3) specifies that during VFR flight at night, operating aircraft are required to have an approved  anti-collision light system, which can include a flashing or rotating beacon and position lights. However, 14 CFR part 91, section  91.209(b) gives the pilot-in-command leeway to turn off the anti-collision lights in the interest of safety.   Airplane position lights are  arranged similar to those of boats and ships. A red light is positioned on the left wingtip, a green light on the right wingtip, and a  white light on the tail.  [Figure 11-4]  

![](images/164146f8a4d3ec4aff5fa9eb49f1b3a0ed3bbf96f5a4985bdae4a21966f89d1f.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.  Position lights.  

This   arrangement provides a means   to   determine the general direction   of   movement of   other   airplanes in   flight. If   both   a red   and   green   light of   another   aircraft are observed,   and   the red   light is   on   the left and   the green   to   the right, the airplane is   flying   the same  direction.   Care must be taken   to   maintain   clearance.    red   were on   the right and   green   to   the left, the airplane could   be on   a collision   course.  

Landing   lights   are not only   useful for   taxi, takeoffs,   and   landings,   but also   provide a means   by   which   airplanes can   be seen   at night by   other   pilots.   Pilots   are encouraged   to   turn   on   their   landing   lights   when   operating   within   10   miles   of   an   airport and   below   10,000   feet.  Operation   with   landing   lights   on   applies    both   day   and   night or    conditions   of   reduced   visibility.   This   should   also   be done in   areas   where flocks   of   birds   may   be expected.  

Although   turning   on   aircraft lights   supports   the “see   and   be seen” concept, pilots   should   continue to   keep   a sharp   lookout for   other   aircraft. Aircraft lights   may   blend   in   with   the stars   or   the lights   of   the cities at night and   go   unnoticed   unless   a conscious   effort is   made to   distinguish   them   from   other   lights.  

# Airport and Navigation Lighting Aids  

The lighting   systems   used   for   airports,   runways,   obstructions,   and   other   visual aids   at night are other   important aspects   of   night flying.   Lighted   airports   located   away   from   congested   areas   are identified   readily   at night by   the lights   outlining   the runways.   Airports   located   near   or   within   large cities are often   difficult to   identify   as the airport lights   tend    blend   with   the city   lights.   It is important to   not only   know   the exact location   of   an   airport relative to   the city,   but also   to   be able to   identify   these airports   by   the characteristics   of   their   lighting   patterns.  

Aeronautical lights   are designed   and   installed   in   a variety   of   colors   and   configurations,   each   having   its   own   purpose.   Although   some  lights   are used   only   during   low   ceiling   and   visibility   conditions,   this   discussion   includes only   the lights   that are fundamental to   visual  flight rules (VFR)   night operation.  

It is   recommended   that prior    a night flight, and   particularly   a cross-country   night flight, that a check   of   the availability   and   status   of   lighting   systems   at the destination   airport is   made.   This   information   can   be found   on   aeronautical charts   and   in   the Chart  Supplements.   The status   of   each   facility   can   be determined   by   reviewing   pertinent Notices to   Airmen   (NOTAMs).  

Most airports   have rotating   beacons.   The beacon   rotates at a constant speed,   thus   producing   a series of   light flashes at regular   intervals. These flashes may   consist of   a white flash   and   one or   two   different colors   that are used   to   identify   various   types   of   landing   areas.   For   example:  

⦁  Lighted   civilian   land   airports—alternating   white and   green   lights   ⦁  Lighted   civilian   water   airports—alternating   white and   yellow   lights   ⦁  Lighted   military   airports—alternating   white and   green   lights,   but are differentiated   from   civil airports   by   dual peaked   (two   quick)   white flashes, then   green  

Beacons   producing   red   flashes indicate   obstructions   or   areas   considered   hazardous   to   aerial navigation.   Steady-burning   red   lights   are  used   to   mark   obstructions   on   or   near   airports   and   sometimes to   supplement flashing   lights   on   en   route obstructions.   High-intensity,   flashing   white lights   are used   to   mark   some supporting   structures of   overhead   transmission   lines that stretch   across   rivers,   chasms,   and   gorges. These high-intensity   lights   are also   used    identify   tall structures, such   as chimneys   and   towers.  

As   a result of   technological advancements,   runway   lighting   systems   have become quite sophisticated   to   accommodate takeoffs   and  landings    various   weather   conditions.   However,    flying    limited    VFR   only,   it is   important to   be familiar   with   the basic lighting   of   runways   and   taxiways.  

The basic runway   lighting   system   consists   of   two   straight parallel lines of   runway   edge lights   defining   the lateral limits   of   the runway.   These lights   are aviation   white,   although   aviation   yellow   may   be substituted   for   a distance   of   2,000   feet from   the far   end   of   the  runway   to   indicate   a caution   zone.   At some airports,   the intensity   of   the runway   edge lights   can   be activated   and   adjusted   by   radio   control. The control system   consists   of   a 3-step   control responsive to   7,   5,   and/or    microphone clicks.   This   3-step   control turns   on   lighting   facilities capable of   either   3-step,   2-step,   or   1-step   operation.   The 3-step   and   2-step   lighting   facilities can   be altered   in   intensity,   while the 1-step   cannot. All lighting    illuminated   for   a period   of   15   minutes from   the most recent time of   activation   and   may   not be extinguished   prior   to   end   of   the 15-minute period.   Suggested   use is   to   always   initially   key   the mike 7   times; this   assures  that all controlled   lights   are turned   on   to   the maximum   available intensity.   If   desired,   adjustment can   then   be made,   where the  capability   is   provided,   to   a lower   intensity   by   keying    and/or    times. Due to   the close proximity   of   airports   using   the same  frequency,   radio-controlled   lighting   receivers   may   be set at a low   sensitivity   requiring   the aircraft to   be relatively   close to   activate the  system.   Consequently,   even   when   lights   are on,   the pilot should   always   key   the mike as directed   when   overflying   an   airport of   intended   landing   or   just prior   to   entering   the final segment of   an   approach.   This   assures the aircraft is   close enough   to   activate the  system   and   a full 15-minute lighting   duration    available.  

The length   limits   of   the runway   are defined   by   straight lines of   lights   across   the runway   ends.   At some airports,   the runway   threshold   lights   are aviation   green,   and   the runway   end   lights   are aviation   red.   At many   airports,   the taxiways   are also   lighted.    taxiway   edge  lighting   system   consists   of   blue lights   that outline the usable limits   of   taxi paths.  

# Training for Night Flight  

Learning    fly   safely   at night takes time and   experience.   Pilot’s   should   practice maneuvers   at night including   straight-and-level flight,  climbs   and   descents,   level turns,   climbing   and   descending   turns,   and   steep   turns.   Practicing   recovery   from   unusual attitudes should   only   be done with   a flight instructor.   Pilots   may   practice these maneuvers   with   all the flight deck   lights   turned   OFF, as well as ON.   This   blackout training   simulates an   electrical or   instrument light failure.   Pilots   should   also   use the navigation   equipment and   local  NAVAIDs during   the training.   In   spite of   fewer   references   or   checkpoints,   night cross-country   flights   do   not present particular   problems    pre-planning    adequate.   Just as during   the day,   the pilot continuously   monitors   position,   time estimates, fuel consumed,   and   uses NAVAIDs, if   available,    assist in   monitoring   en   route progress.  

# Preparation and Preflight  

Night flying   requires that pilots   are aware of,   and   operate within,   their   abilities and   limitations.   Although   careful planning   of   any flight is essential, night flying   demands   more attention    the details of   preflight preparation   and   planning.  

Preparation   for   a night flight includes a thorough   review   of   the available weather   reports   and   forecasts   with   particular   attention   given   to   temperature/dew   point spread.    narrow   temperature/dew   point spread   may   indicate   the possibility   of   fog.   Emphasis   should   also   be  placed   on   wind   direction   and   speed,   since   its   effect on   the airplane cannot be as easily   detected   at night as   during   the day.  

On night cross-country flights, pilots should select and use appropriate aeronautical charts to include the appropriate adjacent charts.  Course lines should be drawn in black to be more distinguishable in low-light conditions. Rotating beacons at airports, lighted  obstructions, lights of cities or towns, and lights from major highway traffic all provide excellent visual checkpoints. If using a global  positioning system (GPS) for navigation, the pilot should ensure that it works properly. All necessary waypoints should be loaded  before the flight, and the database should be checked for accuracy prior to taking off and again once in flight. The use of radio  navigation aids and communication facilities add significantly to the safety and efficiency of night flying.  

Check all personal equipment prior to flight to ensure proper functioning and operation. All airplane lights should be checked for  operation by turning them on momentarily during the preflight inspection. Position lights can be checked for loose connections  by tapping the light fixture. If the lights blink while being tapped, determine the cause prior to flight. Parking ramps should be  checked with a flashlight prior to entering the airplane. During the day, it is quite easy to see stepladders, chuckholes, wheel chocks,  and other obstructions, but at night, it is more difficult and a check of the area can prevent taxiing mishaps.  

# Starting, Taxiing, and Run-up  

Once seated in the airplane and prior to starting the engine, a careful pilot will organize and arrange all items and materials to be used  during the flight. The pilot should also take extra care at night to clear the propeller area. While turning the rotating beacon ON or  flashing the airplane position lights helps alert persons nearby to remain clear of the propeller, the pilot should carefully and  methodically scan the area around the aircraft. To avoid excessive drain of electrical current from the battery, the pilot may turn off  unnecessary electrical equipment until after the engine has been started.  

After starting the engine and when ready to taxi, the pilot turns the taxi or landing light ON. In some airplanes, continuous use of the  landing light while taxiing may place an excessive drain on the airplane’s electrical system. Also, overheating of some types  of landing lights is possible because of inadequate airflow to carry the heat away. If overheating or electrical power is an issue,  the landing light may be used only if necessary. When using lights, consideration should be given to not blinding other pilots.  Pilots should taxi slowly, particularly in congested areas. If taxi lines are painted on the ramp or taxiway, following the lines  ensures a proper path along the route. An instrument check should be done while taxiing to check for proper and correct  operation prior to takeoff.  

While taxiing for any takeoff, the pilot should verify that the aircraft position, taxi route, and runway for the departure all appear as  expected. The taxi diagram, signage, pavement markings, and instruments should all reinforce the pilot's situational awareness. If any  conflicting information or doubt exists, the pilot should not proceed with the taxi or the takeoff. A wrong turn, wrong-surface takeoff,  or takeoff on a closed runway can have catastrophic results, and preventing any of these depends on maintaining situational  awareness while the aircraft moves on the ground.  

When using the checklist for the before-takeoff and run-up checks during the day, any forward movement of the airplane can  be detected easily. However, at night, the airplane could creep forward without being noticed unless the pilot takes steps to prevent  this possibility. Pilots should hold or lock the brakes during the run-up and be alert for any forward movement.  

# Takeoff and Climb  

The most noticeable difference between daylight and nighttime flying is the limited availability of outside visual references   at night.  Therefore, flight instruments should be used to a greater degree in controlling the airplane. This is particularly true on night takeoffs  and climbs. The pilot should adjust the flight deck lights to a minimum brightness that will allow for reading the instruments  and switches but not hinder outside vision. Dimming the lights also eliminates reflections on the windshield and windows.  

After ensuring that the final approach and runway are clear of other air traffic, or when cleared for takeoff by the air traffic controller,  the pilot turns the landing and taxi lights ON and lines the airplane up with the centerline of the runway. If the runway does not have  centerline lighting, the painted centerline and the distance from the runway edge lights on each side indicate the center. The heading  indicator should be noted and correspond or set to the known runway direction. To begin the takeoff, the pilot releases the brakes and  advances the throttle smoothly to maximum allowable power. As it accelerates, the airplane should be kept moving straight  ahead between and parallel to the runway edge lights.  

The procedure for night takeoffs is the same as for normal daytime takeoffs except that many of the runway visual cues are  not   available. The pilot should check the flight instruments frequently during the takeoff to ensure proper airspeed, attitude, and  heading. As the airspeed reaches the normal lift-off speed, the pilot adjusts the pitch attitude to establish a normal climb by referring  to both outside visual references, such as lights, and to the flight instruments.  [Figure 11-5]  Without visual references ahead,  inexperienced pilots may relax right rudder pressure after takeoff and veer off to the left.  

After   becoming   airborne,   the darkness   of   night often   makes it difficult to   note whether   the airplane is   getting   closer    or   farther   from   the surface.   The attitude indicator,   vertical speed   indicator   (VSI),   and   altimeter   should   all indicate   a positive climb.   It is   also   important to   ensure the airspeed    at best climb   speed.  

![](images/5d99792e11ffe48c7f3ad0d0a7e3a514ba89c8f666495619fce6594f93d6a81a.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.  Establish a positive climb.  

The   pilot   makes   necessary   pitch   and   bank   adjustments   by   referencing   the   attitude   and   heading   indicators.     recommended   that  turns   not be made until reaching   a safe maneuvering   altitude.   Although   the use of   the landing   lights    helpful during   the takeoff,   they   become ineffective after   the airplane has climbed   to   an   altitude where the light beam   no   longer   extends   to   the surface.   The light can   cause distortion   when   it is   reflected   by   haze,   smoke,   or   clouds   that might exist in   the climb.   Therefore,   when   the landing   light is   used   for   the takeoff,   it should   be turned   off   after   the climb    well established   provided   it is   not being   used   for   collision   avoidance.  

# Orientation and Navigation  

Generally, at night, it is difficult to see clouds and restrictions to visibility, particularly on dark nights or under an overcast. When  flying under VFR, pilots should exercise caution to avoid flying into clouds. Usually, the first indication of flying into restricted  visibility conditions is the gradual disappearance of lights on the ground. If the lights begin to appear surrounded by a halo or glow,  further flight in the same direction calls for caution. Such a halo or glow around lights on the ground is indicative of ground fog. If a  descent occurs through clouds, smoke, or haze in order to land, the horizontal visibility is considerably less when looking through the  restriction than it is when looking straight down through it from above. Pilots should avoid a VFR night flight if expecting conditions  below VFR minimums. If encountering IMC, risk increases dramatically unless both the pilot and aircraft are equipped for flight  under IFR, and the pilot has prepared and filed an IFR flight plan that can be activated, if needed.  

Crossing large bodies of water at night in single-engine airplanes could be potentially hazardous, because in the event of an  engine failure, the pilot may be forced to land (ditch) the airplane in the water. Another hazard faced by pilots of all aircraft, due to  limited or no lighting, is that the horizon blends with the water. During poor visibility conditions over water, the horizon becomes  obscure and may result in a loss of orientation. Even on clear nights, the stars may be reflected on the water surface, which  could appear as a continuous array of lights, thus making the horizon difficult to identify.  

Lighted runways, buildings, or other objects may cause illusions when seen from different altitudes. At an altitude of 2,000 feet,  a group of lights on an object may be seen individually, while at 5,000 feet or higher, the same lights could appear to be one solid  light mass. These illusions may become quite acute with altitude changes and, if not overcome, could present problems when  making approaches to lighted runways.  

# Approaches and Landings  

When   approaching   the airport to   enter   the traffic pattern   and   land,   it is   important that the runway   lights   and   other   airport lighting   be  identified   as early   as possible.    the airport layout is   unfamiliar,   sighting   of   the runway   may   be difficult until very   close-in   due to   the  maze of   lights   observed    the area.   [Figure 11-6]  A   pilot should   normally   fly   toward   the rotating   beacon   until the lights   outlining   the  runway   are distinguishable.   To   fly   a traffic pattern   of   proper   size and   direction,   the runway   threshold   and   runway-edge lights   need   to   be positively   identified.   Once   the airport lights   are seen,   these lights   should   be kept in   sight throughout the approach.  

![](images/67553495e0b2b9dcf39b43399577d47517ab8eeb2e31f2a46ef50b89c681531a.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.  Use light patterns for orientation.  

Distance   may   be deceptive at night due to   limited   lighting   conditions.    lack   of   intervening   references   on   the ground   and   the   inability   to   compare the size and   location   of   different ground   objects   cause this.   This   also   applies   to   the estimation   of   altitude and   speed.   Consequently,   more dependence   should   be placed   on   flight instruments,   particularly   the altimeter   and   the airspeed   indicator.   Monitoring   the altimeter   prevents   flying   too   low   for   the distance   from   the airport. When   entering   the traffic pattern,   the pilot should   allow   adequate time to   complete the before-landing   checklist. If   the heading   indicator   contains   a heading   bug,   setting   it to   the runway   heading    an   excellent reference   for   the pattern   legs.  

The pilot maintains   the recommended   airspeeds   and   executes the approach   and   landing    the same manner   as during   the day.    low,   shallow   approach   is   definitely   inappropriate during   a night operation.   The altimeter   and   VSI   should   be constantly   cross-checked   against the airplane’s   position   along   the base leg   and   final approach.    visual approach   slope indicator   (VASI)    an   indispensable aid   in   establishing   and   maintaining   a proper   glide path.   [Figure 11-7]  

After   turning   onto   the final approach   and   aligning   the airplane midway   between   the two   rows   of   runway-edge lights,   the pilot should   note and   correct for   any   wind   drift. Throughout the final approach,   proper   use of   pitch   and   power   helps   to   maintain   a stabilized   approach.   Flaps   are used   as in   a normal approach.   Usually,   halfway   through   the final approach,   the landing   light is   turned   on.   The  landing   light is   sometimes ineffective since   the light beam   will usually   not reach   the ground   from   higher   altitudes. The light may   even   be reflected   back   into   the pilot’s   eyes by   any   existing   haze,   smoke,   or   fog.   Safety   considerations   regarding   local traffic and   collision   avoidance   may   overshadow   these disadvantages.

# Figure 11-7.  VASI.  

The round   out and   touchdown    made in   the same manner   as in   day   landings.   At night, the judgment of   height, speed,   and   sink   rate is   impaired   by   the scarcity   of   observable objects    the landing   area.   An   inexperienced   pilot may   have a tendency    round   out too   high.   Continuing   a constant approach   descent until the landing   lights   reflect on   the runway   and   tire   marks   on   the runway   can   be seen   clearly   helps   identify   the point to   begin   the round   out .  At this   point, the round   out is   started   smoothly   and   the throttle gradually   reduced   to   idle as the airplane is   touching   down.   [Figure 11-8]  During   landings   without the use of   landing   lights,   the round   out may   be started   when   the runway   lights   at the far   end   of   the runway   first appear   to   be rising   higher   than   the nose of   the airplane.   This   demands   a  smooth   and   very   timely   round   out and   requires that the pilot feel for   the runway   surface using   power   and   pitch   changes, as necessary,   for   the airplane to   settle slowly   to   the runway.   Blackout landings   should   always   be included   in   night pilot training   as an   emergency   procedure.

# How to Prevent Landing Errors Due to Optical Illusions  

To   prevent these illusions   and   their   potentially   hazardous   consequences,   pilots   can:

# Night Emergencies  

Perhaps   the greatest   concern   about flying   a single-engine airplane at night is   the possibility   of   a complete engine failure and   the  subsequent emergency   landing.   This   is   a legitimate concern,   even   though   continuing   flight into   adverse weather   and   poor   pilot   judgment account for   most serious   accidents.  

If   the engine fails   at night, there are several important procedures and   considerations    keep    mind.   They   are as follows:  

⦁  Maintain   positive control of   the airplane and   establish   the best glide configuration   and   airspeed.   Turn   the       airplane towards   an   airport or   away   from   congested   areas.   ⦁  Check    determine the cause of   the engine malfunction,   such   as the position   of   fuel selectors,   magneto       switch,   or   primer.    possible,   the cause of   the malfunction   should   be corrected   immediately   and   the engine       restarted.   ⦁  Announce   the emergency   situation    air   traffic control (ATC)   or   Universal Communications   (UNICOM).        already    radio   contact with   a facility,   do   not change frequencies unless   instructed    change.   ⦁  If   the condition   of   the nearby   terrain    known   and    suitable for   a forced   landing,   turn   towards   an   unlighted       portion   of   the area   and   plan   an   emergency   forced   landing    an   unlighted   portion.   ⦁  Consider   an   emergency   landing   area   close to   public access    possible.   This   may   facilitate rescue or   help,   if       needed.   ⦁  Maintain   orientation   with   the wind    avoid   a downwind   landing.   ⦁  Complete the before-landing   checklist, and   check   the landing   lights   for   operation   at altitude and   turn   ON in       sufficient time to   illuminate the terrain   or   obstacles   along   the flightpath.   The landing   should   be completed        the normal landing   attitude at the slowest possible airspeed.    the landing   lights   are unusable and   outside       visual references   are not available,   the airplane should   be held    level-landing   attitude until the ground        contacted.   ⦁  After   landing,   turn   off   all switches and   evacuate the airplane as quickly   as possible.  

# Chapter Summary  

Night operations present additional risks that pilots should identify and assess. Night flying operations should not be encouraged or  attempted, except by pilots that are certificated, current, and proficient in night flying. Prior to attempting night operations, pilots  should receive training and be familiar with the risks associated with night flight and how they differ from daylight operations. Even   for experienced pilots, night VFR operations should only be conducted in unrestricted visibility, favorable winds, both on the surface   and aloft, and no turbulence. Additional information on pilot vision and illusions can be found in FAA brochure AM-400-98/2 at  www.faa.gov/pilots/safety/pilot safety brochures/   and also in Chapters 2 and 17 of the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25) at  www.faa.gov . Additional information on lighting aids can be found in Chapter 2 of the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM), which can be accessed at  www.faa.gov .  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 12: Transition to Complex Airplanes  

# Introduction  

A high-performance airplane is defined as an airplane with an engine capable of developing more than 200 horsepower (see 14 CFR  part 61, section 61.31(f)(1)). A complex airplane (see 14 CFR part 61, section 61.1) means an airplane that has a retractable landing  gear, flaps, and a controllable pitch propeller, including airplanes equipped with an engine control system consisting of a digital  computer and associated accessories for controlling the engine and propeller, such as a full authority digital engine control; or, in the  case of a seaplane, flaps and a controllable pitch propeller, including seaplanes equipped with an engine control system consisting of a  digital computer and associated accessories for controlling the engine and propeller, such as a full authority digital engine control.  

Transition to a complex airplane, or a high-performance airplane, can be demanding for many pilots. Both increased performance and  complexity require additional planning, judgment, and piloting skills. Transition to these types of airplanes, therefore, should be  accomplished in a systematic manner through a structured course of training administered by a qualified flight instructor.  

Airplanes can be designed to fly through a wide range of airspeeds. High speed flight requires smaller wing areas and  moderately cambered airfoils whereas low speed flight is obtained with airfoils with a greater camber and larger wing area.  [Figure  12-1]  Many compromises are often made by designers to provide for higher speed cruise flight and low speeds for landing. Flaps are a  common design effort to increase an airfoil’s camber and surface area for lower-speed flight.  [Figure 12-2]  

![](images/22cb6ea90452ef6975ae6f2aada1e1e66c0675b0aef78e99b22cbae075f4af41.jpg)  
Figure 12-1.  Airfoil types.  

Since an airfoil cannot have two different cambers at the same time, designers and engineers deliver the desired performance  characteristics using two different methods. Either the airfoil can be a compromise, or a cruise airfoil can be combined with a device  for increasing the camber of the airfoil for low-speed flight. Camber is the asymmetry between the top and the bottom surfaces of an  airfoil. One method for varying an airfoil’s camber is the addition of trailing-edge flaps. Engineers call these devices a high-lift  system.  

# Function of Flaps  

Flaps work primarily by changing the camber of the airfoil, which increases the wing’s lift coefficient. With some flap designs,  the surface area of the wing is also increased. Flap deflection does not increase the critical (stall) angle of attack (AOA). In some  cases, flap deflection actually decreases the critical AOA. Deflection of a wing’s control surfaces, such as ailerons and flaps, alters  both lift and drag. With aileron deflection, there is asymmetrical lift which imparts a rolling moment about the airplane’s  longitudinal axis. Wing flaps act symmetrically about the longitudinal axis producing no rolling moment; however, both lift and drag  increase as well as a pitching moment about the lateral axis. Lift is a function of several variables including air density, velocity,  surface area, and lift coefficient. Since flaps increase an airfoil’s lift coefficient, lift is increased.  [Figure 12-3]

# Figure 12-3.  Lift equation.  

As flaps are deflected, the aircraft may pitch nose-up, nose-down, or have minimal changes in pitch attitude. Pitching moment is  caused   by   the rearward   movement of   the wing’s   center   of   pressure; however,   that pitching   behavior   depends   on   several variables  including flap type, wing position, downwash behavior, and horizontal tail location. Consequently, pitch behavior depends on the  design features of the particular airplane.  

Flap deflection of up to   $15^{\circ}$   primarily produces lift with minimal increases in drag. Deflection beyond   $15^{\circ}$   produces a large increase  in drag. Drag from flap deflection is parasite drag and, as such, is proportional to the square of the speed. Also, deflection beyond   $15^{\circ}$    produces a significant nose-up pitching moment in most high-wing airplanes because the resulting downwash changes the airflow  over the horizontal tail.  

# Flap Effectiveness  

Flap effectiveness depends on a number of factors, but the most noticeable are size and type. For the purpose of this chapter, trailing  edge flaps are classified as four basic types: plain (hinge), split, slotted, and Fowler.  [Figure 12-4]  

![](images/4b2da60e427c98ceca31ebb6c7576aa3416fc014ae785eb6c497fc3bfdeba334.jpg)  
Figure 12-4.  Four basic types of flaps.  

The plain or hinge flap is a hinged section of the wing. The structure and function are comparable to the other control surfaces—   ailerons, rudder, and elevator. The split flap is more complex. It is the lower or underside portion of the wing; deflection of the flap  leaves the upper trailing edge of the wing undisturbed. It is, however, more effective than the hinge flap because of greater lift and  less pitching moment, but there is more drag. Split flaps are more useful for landing, but the partially deflected hinge flaps have the  advantage in takeoff. The split flap has significant drag at small deflections, whereas the hinge flap does not because airflow remains  “attached” to   the flap.  

The slotted flap has a gap between the wing and the leading edge of the flap. The slot allows high-pressure airflow on the wing  undersurface to energize the lower pressure over the top, thereby delaying flow separation. The slotted flap has greater lift than the  hinge flap but less than the split flap; but, because of a higher lift-drag ratio, it gives better takeoff and climb performance. Small  deflections of the slotted flap give a higher drag than the hinge flap but less than the split. This allows the slotted flap to be used for  takeoff.  

The Fowler flap deflects down and aft to increase the wing area. This flap can be multi-slotted making it the most complex of the  trailing-edge systems. This system does, however, give the maximum lift coefficient. Drag characteristics at small deflections are  much like the slotted flap. Fowler flaps are most commonly used on larger airplanes because of their structural complexity and  difficulty in sealing the slots.  

# Operational Procedures  

It would be impossible to discuss all the many airplane design and flap combinations. Pilots should refer to the Federal Aviation  Administration   (FAA)   approved   Airplane Flight Manual and/or   Pilot’s   Operating   Handbook   (AFM/POH)   for   a given   airplane.   However, while some AFM/POHs are specific as to operational use of flaps, others leave the use of flaps to pilot discretion. Since  flaps are often used for landings and takeoffs, when the airplane is close to the ground, pilot judgment and error avoidance are of  critical importance.  

Since the recommendations given in the AFM/POH are based on the airplane and the flap design, the pilot should relate the  manufacturer’s   recommendation    aerodynamic effects   of   flaps.   This   requires basic background   knowledge of   flap   aerodynamics and  geometry. With this information, a decision as to the degree of flap deflection and time of deflection based on runway and approach  conditions relative to the wind conditions can be made.  

The time of flap extension and the degree of deflection are related. Large changes in flap deflection at one single point in the landing  pattern  can  produce large lift changes that require significant pitch and power changes in order to maintain airspeed and descent  angle. Consequently, there is an advantage to extending flaps in increments while in the landing pattern. Incremental deflection of  flaps on downwind, base leg, and final approach allow smaller adjustments of pitch and power and support a stabilized approach .  

While normal, soft-field, or short-field landings require minimal speed at touchdown, a short-field obstacle approach requires  minimum speed and a steep approach angle. Flap extension, particularly beyond   $30^{\circ}$  , results in significant levels of drag. The drag  can produce a high sink rate that the pilot needs to control with power. When a pilot uses power during a steep approach or short-field  approach to offset the drag produced by the flaps, the landing flare becomes critical. A reduction in power too early can result in a  hard landing, airplane damage, or loss of control. A reduction in power too late causes the airplane to float down the runway.  

Crosswind component is another factor to be considered in the degree of flap extension. The deflected flap presents a surface area for  the wind to act on. With flaps extended in a crosswind, the wing on the upwind side is more affected than the downwind wing. The  effect is reduced to a slight extent in the crabbed approach since the airplane is more nearly aligned with the wind. When using a  wing-low approach, the lowered wing partially blocks the upwind flap. The dihedral of the wing combined with the flap and wind  make lateral control more difficult. Lateral control becomes more difficult as flap extension reaches maximum and the crosswind  becomes perpendicular to the runway.  

With flaps extended, the crosswind effects on the wing become more pronounced as the airplane reaches the ground. The wing, flap,  and   ground   on   the upwind   side of   the airplane form   a “container” that is   filled   with   air   by   the crosswind.   Since   the flap    located  behind the main landing gear, wind striking the deflected flap tends to yaw the airplane into the wind and raise the upwind wing. The  raised wing reduces the tire forces and further increases the tendency to turn into the wind. Proper control position (ailerons into the  wind) is essential for maintaining runway alignment. Depending on the amount of crosswind, it may be necessary to retract the flaps  soon after touchdown in order to maintain control of the airplane.  

The go-around is another factor to consider when making a decision about degree of flap deflection and about where in the landing  pattern to extend flaps. Because of the nose-down pitching moment produced with flap extension, trim is used to offset this pitching  moment. Application of full power in the go-around increases the airflow over the wing. This produces additional lift causing  significant changes in pitch. The pitch-up tendency does not diminish completely with flap retraction because of the trim setting.  Expedient retraction of flaps is desirable to eliminate drag; however, the pilot should be prepared for rapid changes in pitch forces as  the result of trim and the increase in airflow over the control surfaces.  [Figure 12-5]  

![](images/a1e17dee4f5c6f9abb899622915d4d01e7fcfb4428d2187404fe2efa4b9809f0.jpg)  
Figure 12-5.  Flaps extended pitching moment.  

During a go-around, the pilot should carefully monitor pitch and airspeed and expect that the degree of flap deflection and the design  configuration of the horizontal tail relative to the wing will affect go-around characteristics. The pilot should carefully monitor pitch  and airspeed, control flap retraction to minimize altitude loss, and use rudder for coordination. Considering these factors, it is good  practice to extend the same degree of flaps at the same point in the landing pattern for each landing. Consistent use of flaps in the  traffic pattern allows for a preplanned and familiar go-around   sequence   based   on   the airplane’s   position    the landing   pattern.  

There is no single formula to determine the degree of flap deflection to be used on landing because a landing involves variables that  are dependent on   each   other.   The AFM/POH for   the particular   airplane contains   the manufacturer’s   recommendations   for   some  landing   situations.   On   the other   hand,   AFM/POH information   on   flap   usage for   takeoff   is   more precise.   The manufacturer’s   requirements are based on the climb performance produced by a given flap design. Under no circumstances should a flap setting  given in the AFM/POH be exceeded for takeoff.  

# Controllable-Pitch Propeller  

Fixed-pitch propellers are designed for best efficiency at one particular revolutions per minute (rpm) setting and one airspeed. A  fixed-pitch propeller provides suitable performance in a narrow range of airspeeds. However, fixed-pitch efficiency suffers  considerably when operating outside of this range. To provide improved propeller efficiency through a wide range of operation, the  propeller blade angle needs to be controllable.  

# Constant-Speed Propeller  

A constant-speed propeller keeps the blade angle adjusted for maximum efficiency during most flight conditions. The pilot controls  the engine rpm indirectly by means of a propeller control, which is connected to the propeller governor. For maximum takeoff power,  the propeller control is moved all the way forward to the low pitch/high rpm position, and the throttle is moved forward to the  maximum allowable manifold pressure position.  [Figure 12- 6]  To reduce power for climb or cruise, the pilot reduces manifold  pressure to the desired value with the throttle, and then reduces engine rpm by moving the propeller control back toward the high  pitch/low rpm position. The pilot sets the rpm accurately using the tachometer.  

![](images/2af13347241d0af764ad0e7d5a8d821edc846fbe4fac9197a63a982db08c5795.jpg)  
Figure 12-6.  Controllable-pitch propeller pitch angles.  

When an airplane engine runs at a constant governed speed, the torque (force) exerted by the engine at the propeller shaft equals the  force resisting the moving blades. The pilot uses the propeller control to change engine rpm by adjusting the propeller blade pitch,  which increases or decreases the air resistance on the rotating propeller. For example, pulling back on the propeller control moves the  propeller blades to a higher pitch. This increases the air resistance exerted on the spinning propeller and puts an additional load on the  engine, which causes it to slow down until the forces reach equilibrium. Advancing the propeller control reduces the propeller blade  pitch. This reduces the resistance of the air against the propeller. In response, the engine rpm increases until the opposing forces  balance. In order for this system to function, a constant-speed propeller governor needs the means to sense engine rpm and a means to  control the propeller AOA. In most cases, the governor is geared to the engine crankshaft giving it a means to sense engine rpm. The  "Blade Angle Control" section of this chapter discusses the ways a propeller governor adjusts propeller blade angle.  

Other factors affect constant-speed propeller blade pitch. When an airplane is nosed up into a climb from level flight, the engine tends  to slow down. Since the governor is sensitive to small changes in engine rpm, it decreases the blade angle just enough to keep the  engine speed constant. If the airplane is nosed down into a dive, the governor increases the blade angle just enough to keep the engine  speed constant. This allows the engine to maintain a constant rpm and power output. The pilot can also set engine power output by  changing rpm at a constant manifold pressure; by changing the manifold pressure at a constant rpm; or by changing both rpm and  manifold pressure. The constant-speed propeller makes it possible to obtain an infinite number of power settings.  

# Takeoff, Climb, and Cruise  

During takeoff, when the forward motion of the airplane is at a low speed and when maximum power and thrust are required, the  constant-speed propeller sets up a low propeller blade pitch. The low blade angle keeps the blade angle of attack, with respect to the  relative wind, small and efficient at the low speed.  [Figure 12-7]  

At the same time, low blade pitch allows the propeller to handle a smaller mass of air per revolution. This light propeller load allows  the engine to turn at maximum rpm and develop maximum engine power. Although the mass of air per revolution is small, the number  of rpm is high, and propeller thrust is maximized until brake release. Thrust is maximum at the beginning of the takeoff roll and then  decreases as the airplane gains speed.  

![](images/0dca7e9c8c8c1c281c7fc4902a17c92d6c8cec8477da110dfd624cdd6fb3567a.jpg)  
Figure 12-7.  Propeller blade angle.  

As the airspeed increases after lift-off, the load on the engine is lightened because of the small blade angle. The governor senses this  and increases the blade angle slightly. Again, the higher blade angle, with the higher speed, keeps the blade AOA with respect to the  relative wind small and efficient.  

For climb after takeoff, the power output of the engine is reduced to climb power by decreasing the manifold pressure and increasing  the blade angle to lower engine rpm. At the higher (climb) airspeed and the higher blade angle, the propeller is handling a greater  mass of air per second at a lower slipstream velocity. This reduction in power is offset by the increase in propeller efficiency. The  blade AOA is again kept small by the increase in the blade angle with an increase in airspeed.  

At cruising altitude, when the airplane is in level flight, airspeed increases, and less power is required. Consequently, the pilot uses  the throttle to reduce manifold pressure and uses the propeller control to reduce engine rpm. The higher airspeed and higher blade  angle enable the propeller to handle a still greater mass of air per second at still smaller slipstream velocity. At normal cruising  speeds, propeller efficiency is at or near maximum efficiency.  

# Blade Angle Control  

Once the rpm settings for the propeller are selected, the propeller governor automatically adjusts the blade angle to maintain the  selected rpm. It does this by using oil pressure. Generally, the oil pressure used for pitch change comes directly from the engine  lubricating system. When a governor is employed, engine oil is used and the oil pressure is usually boosted by a pump that is  integrated with the governor. The higher pressure provides a quicker blade angle change. The rpm at which the propeller is to operate  is adjusted in the governor head. The pilot changes this setting by changing the position of the governor rack through the flight deck  propeller control.  

On some constant-speed propellers, changes in pitch are obtained by the use of an inherent centrifugal twisting moment of the blades  that tends to flatten the blades toward low pitch and oil pressure applied to a hydraulic piston connected to the propeller blades which  moves them toward high pitch. Another type of constant-speed propeller uses counterweights attached to the blade shanks in the hub.  Governor oil pressure and the blade twisting moment move the blades toward the low pitch position, and centrifugal force acting on  the counterweights moves them (and the blades) toward the high pitch position. In the first case above, governor oil pressure moves  the blades towards high pitch and in the second case, governor oil pressure and the blade twisting moment move the blades toward  low pitch. A loss of governor oil pressure, therefore, affects each differently.  

# Governing Range  

The blade angle range for constant-speed propellers varies from about   $11.5^{\circ}$   to   $40^{\circ}$  . The higher the speed of the airplane, the greater  the blade angle range.  [Figure 12-8]  

![](images/59be3e8dafa794ec26968f0fadf30a7e7e51bb0f1b82ee5d38b20beb88d1f20b.jpg)  
Figure 12-8.  Blade angle range (values are approximate).  

The range of   possible blade angles between   high   and   low   blade angle pitch   stops   define the propeller’s   governing   range.   As   long as  the propeller's blades operate within the governing range and not against either pitch stop, a constant engine rpm is maintained.  However, once the propeller blades reach their pitch-stop limit, the engine rpm increases or decreases with changes in airspeed and  propeller load similar to a fixed-pitch propeller. For example, once a specific rpm is selected, if the airspeed decreases enough, the  propeller blades reduce pitch in an attempt to maintain the selected rpm until they contact their low pitch stops. From that point, any  further reduction in airspeed causes the engine rpm to decrease. Conversely, if the airspeed increases, the pitch angle of the propeller  blades increase until the high pitch stop is reached. The engine rpm then begins to increase.  

# Constant-Speed Propeller Operation  

The engine is started with the propeller control in the low pitch/high rpm position. This position reduces the load or drag of the  propeller and the result is easier starting and warm-up of the engine. During warm-up, the propeller blade changing mechanism is  operated slowly and smoothly through a full cycle. This is done by moving the propeller control (with the manifold pressure set to  produce about 1,600 rpm) to the high pitch/low rpm position, allowing the rpm to stabilize, and then moving the propeller control  back to the low pitch takeoff position. This is done for two reasons: to determine whether the system is operating correctly and to  circulate fresh warm oil through the propeller governor system. Remember the oil has been trapped in the propeller cylinder since the  last time the engine was shut down. There is a certain amount of leakage from the propeller cylinder, and the oil tends to congeal,  especially if the outside air temperature is low. Consequently, if the propeller is not exercised before takeoff, there is a possibility that  the engine may over-speed on takeoff.  

An airplane equipped with a constant-speed propeller has better takeoff performance than a similarly powered airplane equipped with  a fixed-pitch propeller. This is because with a constant-speed propeller, an airplane can develop its maximum rated horsepower (red  line on the tachometer) while motionless. An airplane with a fixed-pitch propeller, on the other hand, needs to accelerate down the  runway to increase airspeed and aerodynamically unload the propeller so that rpm and horsepower can steadily build up to their  maximum. With a constant-speed propeller, the tachometer reading should come up to within 40 rpm of the red line as soon as full  power is applied and remain there for the entire takeoff. Excessive manifold pressure raises the cylinder combustion pressures,  resulting in high stresses within the engine. Excessive pressure also produces high-engine temperatures. A combination of high  manifold pressure and low rpm can induce damaging detonation. In order to avoid these situations, the following sequence should be  followed when making power changes.  

⦁  When increasing power, increase the rpm first and then the manifold pressure  ⦁  When decreasing power, decrease the manifold pressure first and then decrease the rpm  

The cruise power charts in the AFM/POH should be consulted when selecting cruise power settings. Whatever the combinations of  rpm and manifold pressure listed in these charts—they have been flight tested and approved by engineers for the respective airframe  and engine manufacturer. Therefore, if there are power settings, such as 2,100 rpm and 24 inches manifold pressure in the power  chart, they are approved for use. With a constant-speed propeller, a power descent can be made without over-speeding the engine.  The system compensates for the increased airspeed of the descent by increasing the propeller blade angles. If the descent is too rapid  or is being made from a high altitude, the maximum blade angle limit of the blades is not sufficient to hold the rpm constant. When  this occurs, the rpm is responsive to any change in throttle setting.  

Although the governor responds quickly to any change in throttle setting, a sudden and large increase in the throttle setting causes a  momentary over-speeding of the engine until the blades become adjusted to absorb the increased power. If an emergency demanding  full power should arise during approach, the sudden advancing of the throttle causes momentary over-speeding of the engine beyond  the rpm for which the governor is adjusted.  

⦁  The red line on the tachometer not only indicates maximum allowable rpm; it also indicates the rpm  required    obtain   the engine’s   rated   horsepower.   ⦁  A momentary propeller overs-peed may occur when the throttle is advanced rapidly for takeoff. This is  usually not serious if the rated rpm is not exceeded by 10 percent for more than 3 seconds.  ⦁  The green arc on the tachometer indicates the normal operating range. When developing power in this  range, the engine drives the propeller. Below the green arc, however, it is usually the windmilling propeller  that powers the engine. Prolonged operation below the green arc can be detrimental to the engine. On  takeoffs from low elevation airports, the manifold pressure in inches of mercury may exceed the rpm. This  is normal in most cases, but the pilot should always consult the AFM/POH for limitations.  ⦁  All power changes should be made smoothly and slowly to avoid over-boosting and/or over-speeding.  

# Turbocharging  

The turbocharged engine allows the pilot to maintain sufficient cruise power at high altitudes where there is less drag, which means  faster true airspeeds and increased range with fuel economy. At the same time, the powerplant has flexibility and can be flown at a  low altitude without the increased fuel consumption of a turbine engine. When attached to the standard powerplant, the turbocharger  does not take any horsepower from the engine to operate; it is relatively simple mechanically, and some models can pressurize the  cabin as well.  

The turbocharger is an exhaust-driven device that raises the pressure and density of the induction air delivered to the engine. It  consists of two separate components: a compressor and a turbine connected by a common shaft. The compressor supplies pressurized  air to the engine for high-altitude operation. The compressor and its housing are between the ambient air intake and the induction air  manifold. The turbine and its housing are part of the exhaust system and utilize the flow of exhaust gases to drive the compressor.  [Figure 12-9]  

![](images/c29e43cf4d4fd76143b89a6192a1792f4fb486aedc240dd23f839add00e9492b.jpg)  
Figure 12-9.  Turbocharging system.  

The turbine has the capability of producing manifold pressure in excess of the maximum allowable for the particular engine. In order  not to exceed the maximum allowable manifold pressure, a bypass or waste gate is used so that some of the exhaust is diverted  overboard before it passes through the turbine.  

The position of the waste gate regulates the output of the turbine and therefore, the compressed air available to the engine. When the  waste gate is closed, all of the exhaust gases pass through and drive the turbine. As the waste gate opens, some of the exhaust gases  are routed around the turbine through the exhaust bypass and overboard through the exhaust pipe.  

The waste gate actuator is a spring-loaded piston operated by engine oil pressure. The actuator, which adjusts the waste gate position,  is connected to the waste gate by a mechanical linkage.  

The control center of the turbocharger system is the pressure controller. This device simplifies turbocharging to one control: the  throttle. Once the desired manifold pressure is set, virtually no throttle adjustment is required with changes in altitude. The controller  senses compressor discharge requirements for various altitudes and controls the oil pressure to the waste gate actuator, which adjusts  the waste gate accordingly. Thus the turbocharger will maintain the manifold pressure called for by the throttle setting.  

# Ground Boosting Versus Altitude Turbocharging  

Altitude turbocharging   (sometimes called   “normalizing”)    accomplished   by   using   a turbocharger   that maintains   maximum   allowable  sea level manifold pressure (normally 29–30 "Hg) up to a certain altitude. This altitude is specified by the airplane manufacturer and  is   referred   to   as the airplane’s   critical altitude.   Above the critical altitude,   the manifold   pressure decreases as additional altitude is  gained. Ground boosting, on the other hand, is an application of turbocharging where more than the standard 29 inches of manifold  pressure is used in flight. In various airplanes using ground boosting, takeoff manifold pressures may go as high as 45 "Hg.  

Although a sea-level manifold pressure setting and maximum rpm can be maintained up to the critical altitude, the engine may not be  developing sea-level power. Because the turbocharged induction air is heated by compression, lower induction air density causes a  loss of engine power. Maintaining the equivalent horsepower output requires a somewhat higher manifold pressure at a given altitude  than if the induction air were not compressed and heated by turbocharging. If, on the other hand, the system incorporates an automatic  density controller, which automatically positions the waste gate so as to maintain constant air density to the engine, a near equivalent  to sea-level horsepower output results.  

# Operating Characteristics  

First and foremost, all movements of the power controls on turbocharged engines should be slow and smooth. Aggressive or abrupt  throttle movements increase the possibility of over-boosting. Carefully monitor engine indications when making power changes.  

When the waste gate is open, the turbocharged engine reacts the same as a normally aspirated engine when the rpm is varied. That is,  when the rpm is increased, the manifold pressure decreases slightly. When the engine rpm is decreased, the manifold pressure  increases slightly. However, when the waste gate is closed, manifold pressure variation with engine rpm is just the opposite of the  normally aspirated engine. An increase in engine rpm results in an increase in manifold pressure, and a decrease in engine rpm results  in a decrease in manifold pressure.  

Above the critical altitude, where the waste gate is closed, any change in airspeed results in a corresponding change in manifold  pressure. This is true because the increase in ram air pressure with an increase in airspeed is magnified by the compressor resulting in  an increase in manifold pressure. The increase in manifold pressure creates a higher mass flow through the engine, causing higher  turbine speeds and thus further increasing manifold pressure.  

When running at high altitudes, aviation gasoline tends to vaporize prior to reaching the cylinder. If this occurs in the portion of the  fuel system between the fuel tank and the engine-driven fuel pump, an auxiliary positive pressure pump may be needed in the tank.  Since engine-driven pumps pull fuel, they are easily vapor locked. A boost pump provides positive pressure, which pushes the fuel  and reduces the tendency to vaporize.  

# Heat Management  

Turbocharged engines should be thoughtfully and carefully operated with continuous monitoring of pressures and temperatures.  There are two temperatures that are especially important—turbine inlet temperature (TIT) or, in some installations, exhaust gas  temperature (EGT) and cylinder head temperature. TIT or EGT limits are set to protect the elements in the hot section of the  turbocharger,   while cylinder   head   temperature limits   protect the engine’s   internal parts.  

Due to the heat of compression of the induction air, a turbocharged engine runs at higher operating temperatures than a non- turbocharged engine. Because turbocharged engines operate at high altitudes, their environment is less efficient for cooling. At  altitude, the air is less dense and, therefore, cools less efficiently. Also, the less dense air causes the compressor to work harder.  Compressor turbine speeds can reach 80,000–100,000 rpm, adding to the overall engine operating temperatures. Turbocharged  engines are also operated at higher power settings a greater portion of the time.  

High heat is detrimental to piston engine operation. Its cumulative effects can lead to piston, ring, and cylinder head failure and place  thermal stress on other operating components. Excessive cylinder head temperature can lead to detonation, which in turn can cause  catastrophic engine failure. Turbocharged engines are especially heat sensitive. The key to turbocharger operation is effective heat  management.  

Monitor the condition of a turbocharged engine with manifold pressure gauge, tachometer, exhaust gas temperature/turbine inlet  temperature gauge,   and   cylinder   head   temperature gauge.   Manage the “heat system” with   the throttle, propeller   rpm,   mixture,   and  cowl flaps. At any given cruise power, the mixture is the most influential control over the exhaust gas/TIT. The throttle regulates total  fuel flow, but the mixture governs the fuel-to-air ratio. The mixture, therefore, controls temperature.  

Exceeding temperature limits in an after-takeoff climb is usually not a problem since a full rich mixture cools with excess fuel. At  cruise, power is normally reduced and mixture adjusted accordingly. Under cruise conditions, monitor temperature limits closely  because that is when the temperatures are most likely to reach the maximum, even though the engine is producing less power.  Overheating in an en route climb, however, may require fully open cowl flaps and a higher airspeed.  

Since turbocharged engines operate hotter at altitude than normally aspirated engines, they are more prone to damage from cooling  stress. Gradual reductions in power and careful monitoring of temperatures are essential in the descent phase. Extending the landing  gear during the descent may help control the airspeed while maintaining a higher engine power setting. This allows the pilot to reduce  power in small increments which allows the engine to cool slowly. It may also be necessary to lean the mixture slightly to eliminate  roughness at the lower power settings.  

# Turbocharger Failure  

Because of the high temperatures and pressures produced in the turbine exhaust system, any malfunction of the turbocharger should  be treated   with   extreme caution.   In   all cases of   turbocharger   operation,   the manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures should   be  followed.   This   is   especially   so   in   the case of   turbocharger   malfunction.   However,   in   those instances   where the manufacturer’s   procedures do not adequately describe the actions to be taken in the event of a turbocharger failure, the following procedures should  be used.  

# Over-Boost Condition  

If an excessive rise in manifold pressure occurs during normal advancement of the throttle (possibly owing to faulty operation of the  waste gate):  

⦁  Immediately retard the throttle smoothly to limit the manifold pressure below the maximum for the rpm  and mixture setting.  ⦁  Operate the engine in such a manner as to avoid a further over-boost condition.  

# Low Manifold Pressure  

Although this condition may be caused by a minor fault, it is quite possible that a serious exhaust leak has occurred creating a  potentially hazardous situation:  

⦁  Shut down the engine in accordance with the recommended engine failure procedures, unless a greater      emergency exists that warrants continued engine operation.  

⦁  If continuing to operate the engine, use the lowest power setting demanded by the situation and land as  soon as practicable.  

It is very important to ensure that corrective maintenance is undertaken following any turbocharger malfunction.  

# Retractable Landing Gear  

The primary benefits of being able to retract the landing gear are increased climb performance and higher cruise airspeeds due to a  decrease in drag after gear retraction. Retractable landing gear systems may be operated either hydraulically or electrically or may  employ a combination of the two systems. Warning indicators are provided in the flight deck to show the pilot when the wheels are  down and locked and when they are up and locked or if they are in intermediate positions. Systems for emergency operation are also  provided. Due to the complexity of a retractable landing gear system, the pilot should adhere to specific operating procedures and  should not exceed any operating limitations.  

# Landing Gear Systems  

An electrical landing gear retraction system utilizes an electrically-driven motor for gear operation. The system is basically an  electrically-driven jack for raising and lowering the gear. When a switch in the flight deck is moved to the UP position, the electric  motor operates. Through a system of shafts, gears, adapters, an actuator screw, and a torque tube, a force is transmitted to the drag  strut linkages. Thus, the gear retracts and locks. Struts are also activated that open and close the gear doors. If the switch is moved to  the DOWN position, the motor reverses and the gear moves down and locks. Once activated, the gear motor continues to operate until  an   up   or   down   limit switch   on   the motor’s   gearbox    tripped.  

A hydraulic landing gear retraction system utilizes pressurized hydraulic fluid to actuate linkages to raise and lower the gear. When a  switch in the flight deck is moved to the UP position, hydraulic fluid is directed into the gear up line. The fluid flows through  sequenced valves and downlocks to the gear actuating cylinders. A similar process occurs during gear extension. The pump that  pressurizes the fluid in the system can be either engine-driven or electrically-powered. If an electrically-powered pump is used to  pressurize the fluid, the system is referred to as an electro hydraulic system. The system also incorporates a hydraulic reservoir to  contain excess fluid and to provide a means of determining system fluid level.  

Regardless of its power source, the hydraulic pump is designed to operate within a specific range. When a sensor detects excessive  pressure, a relief valve within the pump opens, and hydraulic pressure is routed back to the reservoir. Another type of relief valve  prevents excessive pressure that may result from thermal expansion. Hydraulic pressure is also regulated by limit switches. Each gear  has two limits switches—one dedicated to extension and one dedicated to retraction. These switches de-energize the hydraulic pump  after the landing gear has completed its gear cycle. In the event of limit switch failure, a backup pressure relief valve activates to  relieve excess system pressure.  

# Controls and Position Indicators  

Landing gear position is controlled by a switch on the flight deck panel. In most airplanes, the gear switch is shaped like a wheel in  order to facilitate positive identification and to differentiate it from other flight deck controls.  

Landing gear position indicators vary with different make and model airplanes. Some types of landing gear position indicators utilize  a group of lights. One type consists of one green light to indicate when the landing gear is down and an amber light to indicate when  the gear is up.  [Figure 12-10]  Another type consists of a group of three green lights, which illuminate when the landing gear is down  and locked.  [Figure 12-10]     Still other systems incorporate a red or amber light to indicate when the gear is in transit or unsafe for  landing.  [Figure 12-11]  When   the lights   use a “press   to   test” feature,   the bulbs   are often   interchangeable.   Integrated   electronic  displays may also indicate gear position on a portion of the screen without any dedicated lights.  

Other types of landing gear position indicators consist of tab-type indicators   with   markings   “UP” to   indicate   the gear   is   up   and   locked, a display of red and white diagonal stripes to show when the gear is unlocked, or a silhouette of each gear to indicate when it  locks in the DOWN position.  

# Landing Gear Safety Devices  

Most airplanes with a retractable landing gear have a gear warning horn that sounds when the airplane is configured for landing and  the landing gear is not down and locked. Normally, the horn is linked to the throttle or flap position and/or the airspeed indicator so  that when the airplane is below a certain airspeed, configuration, or power setting with the gear retracted, the warning horn sounds.  

Accidental retraction of a landing gear may be prevented by such devices as mechanical downlocks, safety switches, and ground  locks. Mechanical downlocks are built-in components of a gear retraction system and are operated automatically by the gear  retraction system. To prevent accidental operation of the downlocks and inadvertent landing gear retraction while the airplane is on  the ground, electrically-operated safety switches are installed.

Figure 12-10.  Typical landing gear switch with combination amber and green. Another combination has a three light indicator.

Figure 12-11.  Landing gear handles and single and multiple light indictor.  

A landing gear safety switch, sometimes referred to as a squat switch, is usually mounted in a bracket on one of the main gear shock  struts.  [Figure 12-12]  When the strut is compressed by the weight of the airplane, the switch opens the electrical circuit to the motor  or mechanism that powers retraction. In this way, if the landing gear switch in the flight deck is placed in the RETRACT position  when weight is on the gear, the gear remains extended, and the warning horn may sound as an alert to the unsafe condition. Once the  weight is off the gear, however, such as on takeoff, the safety switch releases and the gear retracts.  

![](images/c39da6ba20c67ae18f11bb8fdc91eef44fe024d402a3f663970d245afaba6bc0.jpg)  
Figure 12-12.  Landing gear safety switch.  

Many airplanes are equipped with removable safety devices to prevent collapse of the gear when the airplane is on the ground. These  devices are called ground locks. One common type is a pin installed in aligned holes drilled in two or more units of the landing gear  support structure. Another type is a spring-loaded clip designed to fit around and hold two or more units of the support structure  together. All types of ground locks usually have red streamers permanently attached to them to readily indicate whether or not they  are installed.  

# Emergency Gear Extension Systems  

The emergency gear extension system lowers the landing gear if the main power system fails. Some airplanes have an emergency  release handle in the flight deck, which is connected through a mechanical linkage to the gear uplocks. When the handle is operated, it  releases the uplocks and allows the gear to free fall or extend under their own weight.  [Figure 12-13]  

On other airplanes, release of the uplock is accomplished using compressed gas, which is directed to uplock release cylinders. In  some airplanes, design configurations make emergency extension of the landing gear by gravity and air loads alone impossible or  impractical. In these airplanes, provisions are included for forceful gear extension in an emergency. Some installations are designed  so that either hydraulic fluid or compressed gas provides the necessary pressure, while others use a manual system, such as a hand  crank for emergency gear extension.  [Figure 12-14]  Hydraulic pressure for emergency operation of the landing gear may be provided  by an auxiliary hand pump, an accumulator, or an electrically-powered hydraulic pump depending on the design of the airplane.  

# Operational Procedures  Preflight  

Because of their complexity, retractable landing gear demands a close inspection prior to every flight. The inspection should begin  inside the flight deck. First, make certain that the landing gear selector switch is in the GEAR DOWN position. Then, turn on the  battery master switch and ensure that the landing gear position indicators show that the gear is down and locked.  

![](images/04db8dd51743f82b05c5c0612766c630a469c4886f0d25c530c6962cb3c2448e.jpg)

Figure 12-14.  Retractable landing gear inspection checkpoints.  

External inspection of the landing gear consists of checking individual system components.  [Figure 12-14]  The landing gear, wheel  well, and adjacent areas should be clean and free of mud and debris. Dirty switches and valves may cause false safe light indications  or interrupt the extension cycle before the landing gear is completely down and locked. The wheel wells should be clear of any  obstructions, as foreign objects may damage the gear or interfere with its operation. Bent gear doors may be an indication of possible  problems with normal gear operation.  

Ensure shock struts are properly inflated and that the pistons are clean. Check main gear and nose gear uplock and downlock  mechanisms for general condition. Power sources and retracting mechanisms are checked for general condition, obvious defects, and  security of attachment. Check hydraulic lines for signs of chafing and leakage at attach points. Warning system micro switches (squat  switches) are checked for cleanliness and security of attachment. Actuating cylinders, sprockets, universal joints, drive gears,  linkages, and any other accessible components are checked for condition and obvious defects. The airplane structure to which the  landing gear is attached is checked for distortion, cracks, and general condition. All bolts and rivets should be intact and secure.  

# Takeoff and Climb  

Normally, the landing gear is retracted after lift-off when the airplane has reached an altitude where, in the event of an engine failure  or other emergency requiring an aborted takeoff, the airplane could no longer be landed on the runway. This procedure, however, may  not apply to all situations. Preplan landing gear retraction taking into account the following:  

⦁  Length of the runway  ⦁  Climb gradient  ⦁  Obstacle clearance requirements  ⦁  The characteristics of the terrain beyond the departure end of the runway  ⦁  The climb characteristics of the particular airplane  

For example, in some situations it may be preferable, in the event of an engine failure, to make an off airport forced landing with the  gear   extended   in   order   to   take advantage of   the energy   absorbing   qualities   of   the terrain   (see   Chapter   18,   “Emergency   Procedures”).   In which case, a delay in retracting the landing gear after takeoff from a short runway may be warranted. In other situations, obstacles  in the climb path may warrant a timely gear retraction after takeoff. Also, in some airplanes the initial climb pitch attitude is such that  any view of the runway remaining is blocked, making an assessment of the feasibility of touching down on the remaining runway  difficult.  

Avoid premature landing gear retraction and do not retract the landing gear until a positive rate of climb is indicated on the flight  instruments. If the airplane has not attained a positive rate of climb, there is always the chance it may settle back onto the runway with  the gear retracted. This is especially so in cases of premature lift-off. Remember that leaning forward to reach the landing gear  selector may result in inadvertent forward pressure on the yoke, which causes the airplane to descend.  

As   the   landing   gear   retracts,   airspeed   increases   and   the   airplane’s   pitch   attitude   may   change.   The   gear   may   take   several   seconds to  retract. Gear retraction and locking (and gear extension and locking) is accompanied by sound and feel that are unique to the specific  make and model airplane. Become familiar with the sound and feel of normal gear retraction so that any abnormal gear operation can  be readily recognized. Abnormal landing gear retraction is most often a clear sign that the gear extension cycle will also be abnormal.  

# Approach and Landing  

The operating loads placed on the landing gear at higher airspeeds may cause structural damage due to the forces of the airstream.  Limiting speeds, therefore, are established for gear operation to protect the gear components from becoming overstressed during  flight. These speeds may not be found on the airspeed indicator. They are published in the AFM/POH for the particular airplane and  are usually listed on placards in the flight deck. [ Figure 12-15]  The maximum landing extended speed   $(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{LE}})$   is the maximum speed at  which the airplane can be flown with the landing gear extended. The maximum landing gear operating speed   $({\bf V}_{\mathrm{LO}})$   is the  maximum speed at which the landing gear may be operated through its cycle.  

![](images/3fc1a660884d7ecf07f2a5076f79f3731ad82bcec7160300e4117d2e8d6b29b5.jpg)  
Figure 12-15.  Placarded gear speeds in the flight deck.  

The landing gear is extended by placing the gear selector switch in the GEAR DOWN position. As the landing gear extends, the  airspeed decreases and the pitch attitude may change. During the several seconds it takes for the gear to extend, be attentive to any  abnormal sounds or feel. Confirm that the landing gear has extended and locked by the normal sound and feel of the system  operation, as well as by the gear position indicators in the flight deck. Unless the landing gear has been previously extended to aid in  a descent to traffic pattern altitude, the landing gear should be extended by the time the airplane reaches a point on the downwind leg  that is opposite the point of intended landing. Establish a standard procedure consisting of a specific position on the downwind leg at  which to lower the landing gear. Strict adherence to this procedure aids in avoiding unintentional gear up landings.  

Operation of an airplane equipped with a retractable landing gear requires the deliberate, careful, and continued use of an appropriate  checklist. When on the downwind leg, make it a habit to complete the before-landing checklist for that airplane. This accomplishes  two purposes —i t ensures that action has been taken to lower the gear and establishes awareness so that the gear down indicators can  be rechecked prior to landing.  

Unless good operating practices dictate otherwise, the landing roll should be completed and the airplane should be clear of the  runway before any levers or switches are operated. This technique greatly reduces the chance of inadvertently retracting the landing  gear while on the ground. Wait until after rollout and clearing the runway to focus attention on the after-landing checklist. This  practice allows for positive identification of the proper controls.  

When transitioning to retractable gear airplanes, it is important to consider some frequent pilot errors. These include pilots that have:  

⦁  Neglected to extend landing gear  ⦁  Inadvertently retracted landing gear  ⦁  Activated gear but failed to check gear position  ⦁  Misused emergency gear system  ⦁  Retracted gear prematurely on takeoff  ⦁  Extended gear too late  

These mistakes are not only committed by pilots who have just transitioned to complex aircraft, but also by pilots who have  developed a sense of complacency over time. In order to minimize the chances of a landing gear-related mishap:  

⦁  Use an appropriate checklist. (A condensed checklist mounted in view is a reminder for its use and easy      reference can be especially helpful.)  ⦁  Be familiar with, and periodically review, the landing gear emergency extension procedures for the      particular airplane.  ⦁  Be familiar with the landing gear warning horn and warning light systems for the particular airplane. Use the      horn system to cross-check the warning light system when an unsafe condition is noted.  ⦁  Review the procedure for replacing light bulbs in the landing gear warning light displays for the particular      airplane, if applicable, so that you can properly replace a bulb to determine if the bulb(s) in the display is      good. If bulbs are replaceable, check to see if spare bulbs are available in the airplane spare bulb supply as      part of the preflight inspection.  

⦁  Be familiar with and aware of the sounds and feel of a properly operating landing gear system.  

# Transition Training  

Transition to a complex airplane or a high-performance airplane should be accomplished through a structured course of training  administered by a competent and qualified flight instructor. The training should be accomplished in accordance with a ground and  flight training syllabus.  [Figure 12-16]  

This sample syllabus for transition training is an example. The arrangement of the subject matter may be changed and the emphasis  shifted to fit the qualifications of the transitioning pilot, the airplane involved, and the circumstances of the training situation. The  goal is to ensure proficiency standards are achieved. These standards are contained in the Airman Certification Standards for the  certificate that the transitioning pilot holds or is working toward.  

![Figure 12-16.  Sample transition training syllabus.  ](images/3808b7a7cd9ad68094ff80cf785228d36f15f85addc7fb10573b1066fd976daa.jpg)  

The training times indicated in the syllabus are for illustration purposes. Actual times should be based on the capabilities of the pilot.  The time periods may be minimal for pilots with higher qualifications or increased for pilots who do not meet certification  requirements or have had little recent flight experience.  

# Chapter Summary  

Flying a complex or high-performance airplane requires a pilot to further divide his or her attention during the most critical phases of  flight: takeoff and landing. The knowledge, judgment, and piloting skills required to fly these airplanes needs to be developed. It is  essential that adequate training is received to ensure a complete understanding of the systems, their operation (both normal and  emergency), and operating limitations.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 13: Transition to Multiengine Airplanes  

# Introduction  

This chapter is devoted to the factors associated with the operation of small multiengine airplanes. For the purpose of this handbook,  a “small” multiengine airplane is   a reciprocating   or   turbopropeller-powered airplane with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of  12,500 pounds or less. This discussion assumes a conventional design with two engines—one mounted on each wing. Reciprocating  engines are assumed unless otherwise noted. The term “light-twin,”   although not formally defined in the regulations, is used herein as  a small multiengine airplane with a maximum certificated takeoff weight of 6,000 pounds or less.  

There are several unique characteristics of multiengine airplanes that make them worthy of a separate class rating. The one engine  inoperative (OEI) flight information presented in this chapter emphasizes the significant difference between flying a multiengine and  a single-engine airplane. However, all pilots need appropriate knowledge, risk management strategies, and skills to fly safely in any  airplane they fly, and mastery of OEI flight is only one aspect of safe multiengine flying.  The modern, well-equipped multiengine  airplane can be remarkably capable under many circumstances, but, t he performance and system redundancy of a multiengine airplane  only increase safety if the pilot is trained and proficient.  

The airplane manufacturer is the final authority on the operation of a particular make and model airplane. Flight instructors and  learners   should   use the Federal Aviation   Administration’s   Approved   Flight Manual (AFM)   and/or   the Pilot’s   Operating   Handbook   (POH).   The airplane manufacturer’s   guidance   and   procedures take precedence   over   any   general recommendations   made in   this   handbook.  

# General  

Multiengine and single-engine airplanes operate differently during an engine failure. In a multiengine airplane, loss of thrust from one  engine affects both  performance and control . The most obvious problem is the loss of 50 percent of power, which reduces climb  performance 80 to 90 percent. In some cases after an engine failure, the ability to climb or maintain altitude in a light-twin may not  exist. After an engine failure, asymmetrical thrust also creates control issues for the pilot. Attention to both these factors is crucial to  safe OEI flight.  

# Terms and Definitions  

Pilots of single-engine airplanes are already   familiar   with   many   performance   “V” speeds   and   their   definitions.   Twin-engine airplanes  have several additional V-speeds   unique to   OEI   operation.   These speeds   are differentiated   by   the notation   “SE”   for   single engine.    review of some key V-speeds and several new    $\mathrm{V}$  -speeds unique to twin-engine airplanes are listed below.  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{R}}.$  —rotation speed—speed at which back pressure is applied to rotate the airplane to a takeoff      attitude.  ⦁  $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$  —lift-off speed—speed at which the airplane leaves the surface. (Note: Some manufacturers    reference takeoff performance data to  $\mathrm{V_{R}}$  , others to  $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$  . )  ⦁  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  —best angle of climb speed—speed at which the airplane gains the greatest altitude for a given distance      of forward travel.  ⦁  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{MSE}}$  —best angle-of-climb speed with OEI.  ⦁  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  —best rate of climb speed—speed at which the airplane gains the most altitude for a given unit of time.  ⦁  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  —best rate of climb speed with OEI. Marked with a blue radial line on most airspeed indicators.      Above the single-engine absolute ceiling, V YSE  yields the minimum rate of sink.  ⦁  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$  —safe, intentional OEI speed—originally known as safe single-engine speed. It is the minimum speed       to intentionally render the critical engine inoperative.  ⦁  $\mathrm{V_{REF}}$  —reference landing speed—an airspeed used for final approach, which is normally 1.3 times     $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  , the stall speed in the landing configuration. The pilot may adjust the approach speed for winds  and gusty conditions by using   $\mathrm{V_{REF}}$   plus an additional number of units (e.g.,  $\mathrm{V_{REF}}{+5}$  ).  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  — currently defined in 14 CFR part 23, section 23.2135(c) as the calibrated airspeed at which, following  the sudden critical loss of thrust, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane.   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   is typically marked  with a red radial line on most airspeed indicators [ Figure 13-1 ].  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    was previously defined in 14 CFR  part 23, section 23.149 as the calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made  inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative, and  thereafter maintain straight flight at the same speed with an angle of bank of not more than 5 degrees. This  definition still applies to airplanes certified under that regulation. There is no requirement under either  determination that the airplane be capable of climbing at this airspeed.  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  only addresses directional    control. Further discussion of  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   as determined during airplane certification and demonstrated in pilot  training follows later in this chapter.

Figure 13-1.  Airspeed indicator markings for a multiengine airplane  

Unless otherwise noted, when V-speeds are given in the AFM/POH, they apply to sea level, standard day conditions at maximum  takeoff weight. Performance speeds vary with aircraft weight, configuration, and atmospheric conditions. The speeds may be stated in  statute miles per hour (mph) or knots (kt), and they may be given as calibrated airspeeds (CAS) or indicated airspeeds (IAS). As a  general rule, the newer AFM/POHs show V-speeds in knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). Some V-speeds are also stated in knots  calibrated airspeed (KCAS) to meet certain regulatory requirements. Whenever available, pilots should operate the airplane from  published indicated airspeeds.  

Rate of climb is the altitude gain per unit of time, while climb gradient is the actual measure of altitude gained per 100 feet of  horizontal travel, expressed as a percentage. An altitude gain of 1.5 feet per 100 feet of travel (or 15 feet per 1,000 or 150 feet per  10,000) is a climb gradient of 1.5 percent.  

There is a dramatic performance loss associated with the loss of an engine, particularly just after takeoff. Any airplane’s  climb performance is a function of thrust horsepower, which is in excess of that required for level flight. In a hypothetical twin  with each engine producing 200 thrust horsepower, assume that the total level flight thrust horsepower required is 175. In this  situation, the airplane would ordinarily have a reserve of 225 thrust horsepower available for climb. Loss of one engine would leave  only 25   (200 minus 175) thrust horsepower available for climb, a drastic reduction.  

The performance characteristics of an airplane depend upon the rules in effect during type certification and do not depend on the  production year after certification. The current amendment to 14 CFR part 23, 81 FR 96689, went into effect on December 30, 2016.  This includes certification of normal category airplanes with passenger seating configuration of 19 or less and a maximum certificated  takeoff weight   of   19,000 pounds or less (section 23.2005(a)). Current 14 CFR part 23 certification rules (section 23.2005(b)) classify  airplanes into certification levels 1 through 4 based on maximum passenger seating configuration. For example, a level 2 airplane has  a passenger seating configuration between two and six passengers. The rule further divides airplanes into two different performance  levels based on speed (section 23.2005(c)). After a critical loss of thrust, a level 2 low speed airplane (  $\mathrm{V_{NO}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$    less than or equal  to 250 knots calibrated airspeed and   $\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{MO}}$    less than or equal to 0.6) that does not meet single-engine crashworthiness requirements  requires a climb gradient of at least 1.5 percent at a pressure altitude of 5,000 feet in the cruise configuration for certification (section  23.2120(b)(1)).  

While, the various subsets of airplanes receiving certification under the current part 23 meet specific single-engine climb performance  criteria as listed in 14 CFR part 23, section 23.2120(b), the historical 14 CFR part 23 single-engine climb performance requirements  for reciprocating engine-powered multiengine airplanes are broken down as follows:  

⦁  More than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and/or   $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$    more than 61 knots: the single-engine rate of climb      in feet per minute (fpm) at 5,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) must be equal to at least 0.027 V 2. For airplanes type  certificated February 4, 1991, or thereafter, the climb requirement is expressed in terms of a  c limb gradient, 1.5 percent.    The climb gradient is not a direct equivalent of the .027 V  $027\;\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SO}}\,2$  2 formula. Do not confuse the date of type certification     with the airplane’s model year. The type certification basis of many   multiengine airplanes dates back to the Civil  Aviation Regulations (CAR) 3.  

⦁  6,000 pounds or less maximum weight and V  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SO}}\,61$  61 knots or less: the single-engine rate of climb at 5,000  feet MSL must simply be determined. The rate of climb could be a negative number. There is no  requirement for a single-engine positive rate of climb at 5,000 feet or any other altitude. For light-twins  type certificated February 4, 1991, or thereafter, the single-engine climb gradient (positive or negative) is  simply determined.  

# Operation of Systems  

This section deals with systems and equipment that are generally installed in multiengine airplanes. Multiengine airplanes share many  features with complex single-engine airplanes. However, there are certain features that are found more often in airplanes with two or  more engines.  

# Feathering Propellers  

Although the propellers of a multiengine airplane may appear identical to a constant-speed propeller used in many single-engine  airplanes, this is usually not the case. The pilot of a typical multiengine airplane can feather the propeller of an inoperative engine.  Since   it stops   engine rotation   with   the propeller   blade streamlined   with   the airplane’s   relative wind,   feathering   the propeller of an  inoperative engine minimizes propeller drag.  [Figure 13-2]  Depending upon single-engine performance, this feature often permits  continued flight to a suitable airport following an engine failure.  

Feathering is important because of the change in parasite drag with propeller blade angle.  [Figure 13-3]  When the propeller blade  angle is in the feathered position, parasite drag from the propeller is at a minimum. In a typical multiengine airplane, the parasite drag  from a single, feathered propeller is a small part the airplane's total drag.  

At the smaller blade angles near the flat pitch position, the drag added by the propeller is large. At these small blade angles, the  propeller windmilling at high revolutions per minute (rpm) can create enough drag to make the airplane difficult or impossible to  control. A propeller windmilling at high speed in the low range of blade angles can produce parasite drag as great as the parasite drag  of the entire airframe.

In contrast, the constant-speed propellers installed on most multiengine airplanes are full feathering, counterweighted, oil-pressure-to­ decrease-pitch designs. In this design, increased oil pressure from the propeller governor drives the blade angle toward low pitch,  high rpm—away from the feather blade angle. In effect, the only thing that keeps these propellers from feathering is a constant supply  of high-pressure engine oil. This is a necessity to enable propeller feathering in the event of a loss of oil pressure or a propeller  governor failure.  

Aerodynamic forces acting upon a windmilling propeller tend to drive the blades to low pitch, high rpm. Counterweights attached to  the shank of each blade tend to force the blades to high pitch, low rpm. Inertia, or the apparent force (called centrifugal force) acting  through the counterweights, is generally slightly greater than the aerodynamic forces. Therefore, centrifugal force would drive the  blades to high pitch and low rpm were it not for an additional force acting through the propeller governor. A controlling force  generated from high pressure oil from the propeller governor pushes the propeller blade angles toward low pitch and high rpm. Thus,  a reduction in oil pressure allows the counterweights to drive the blades to a higher pitch and decreases engine rpm.  [Figure 13-4]  

To feather the propeller, the propeller control is brought fully aft. All oil pressure is dumped from the governor, and the  counterweights drive the propeller blades toward feather. As centrifugal force acting on the counterweights decays from decreasing  rpm, additional forces are needed to completely feather the blades. This additional force comes from either a spring or high-pressure  air stored in the propeller dome, which forces the blades into the feathered position. The entire process may take up to 10 seconds.  

![](images/da35f72ccb2e419e31a76e3d222aee66b85920dab400d492a6257e07832a9914.jpg)  
Figure 13-4.  Pitch change forces.  

Feathering a propeller only alters blade angle and stops engine rotation. To completely secure the engine, the pilot turns off the fuel  (mixture, electric boost pump, and fuel selector), ignition, alternator/generator, and closes the cowl flaps. If the airplane is  pressurized, there may also be an air bleed to close for the failed engine. Some airplanes are equipped with firewall shutoff valves that  secure several of these systems with a single switch.  

Completely securing a failed engine may not be necessary or even desirable depending upon the failure mode, altitude, and time  available. The position of the fuel controls, ignition, and alternator/generator switches of the failed engine has no effect on aircraft  performance, and the pilot might manipulate the incorrect switch under conditions of haste or pressure.  

To unfeather a propeller, the engine should be rotated so that oil pressure can be generated to move the propeller blades from the  feathered position. The ignition is turned on prior to engine rotation with the throttle at low idle and the mixture rich. With the  propeller control in a high rpm position, the starter is engaged. The engine begins to windmill, start, and run as oil pressure moves the  blades out of feather. As the engine starts, the propeller rpm should be immediately reduced until the engine has had several minutes  to warm up; the pilot should monitor cylinder head and oil temperatures.  

An unfeathering accumulator is a device that permits starting a feathered engine in-flight without the use of the electric starter. An  accumulator is any device that stores a reserve of high pressure. On multiengine airplanes, the unfeathering accumulator stores a small  reserve of engine oil under pressure from compressed air or nitrogen. To start a feathered engine in-flight, the pilot moves the  propeller control out of the feather position to release the accumulator pressure. The oil flows under pressure to the propeller hub and  drives the blades toward the high rpm, low pitch position, whereupon the propeller usually begins to windmill. If fuel and ignition are  present, the engine starts and runs. High oil pressure from the propeller governor recharges the accumulator just moments after engine  rotation begins making it available for another unfeathering cycle, if needed. For airplanes used in training, an unfeathering  accumulator may prolong the life of the electric starter and battery. If the accumulator fails to bring the propeller out of feather, the  electric starter may be engaged.  

In any event, the AFM/POH procedures should be followed for the exact unfeathering procedure. Both feathering and starting a  feathered reciprocating engine on the ground are strongly discouraged by manufacturers due to the excessive stress and vibrations  generated.  

As just described, a loss of oil pressure from the propeller governor allows the counterweights, spring, and/or dome charge to drive  the blades to feather. Logically then, the propeller blades should feather every time an engine is shut down as oil pressure falls to  zero. However, below approximately 800 rpm, a reduction in centrifugal force allows small anti-feathering lock pins in the pitch  changing mechanism of the propeller hub to move into place and block feathering. Therefore, if a propeller is to be feathered, it needs  to be done before engine rpm decays below approximately 800. On one popular model of turboprop engine, the propeller blades do,  in fact, feather with each shutdown. This propeller is not equipped with such centrifugally-operated pins due to a unique engine  design.  

# Propeller Synchronization  

Many   multiengine airplanes have a propeller   synchronizer   (prop   sync)   installed   to   eliminate the annoying   “drumming” or   “beat”   of  propellers whose rpm are close, but not precisely the same. To use prop sync, the propeller rpms are coarsely matched by the pilot  and   the system    engaged.   The prop   sync adjusts   the rpm   of   the “slave”   engine to   precisely   match   the rpm   of   the “master” engine and  then maintains that relationship.  

The prop sync should be disengaged when the pilot selects a new propeller rpm and then re-engaged after the new rpm is set. The  prop sync should always be off for takeoff, landing, and single-engine operation. The AFM/POH should be consulted for system  description and limitations.  

A variation on the propeller synchronizer is the propeller synchrophaser. A propeller synchrophaser acts much like a synchronizer to  precisely match rpm, but the synchrophaser goes one step further. It not only matches rpm but actually compares and adjusts the  positions of the individual blades of the propellers in their arcs. There can be significant propeller noise and vibration reductions with  a propeller   synchrophaser.   From   the pilot’s   perspective,   operation   of   a propeller   synchronizer   and   a propeller   synchrophaser   are very  similar. A synchrophaser is also commonly referred to as prop sync, although that is not entirely correct nomenclature from a  technical standpoint.  

As a pilot aid to manually synchronizing the propellers, some twins have a small gauge mounted in or by the tachometer(s) with a  propeller symbol on a disk that spins. The pilot manually fine tunes the engine rpm so as to stop disk rotation, thereby synchronizing  the propellers. This is a useful backup to synchronizing engine rpm using the audible propeller beat. This gauge is also found installed  with most propeller synchronizer and synchrophase systems. Some synchrophase systems use a knob for the pilot to control the phase  angle.  

# Fuel Crossfeed  

Fuel crossfeed systems are also unique to multiengine airplanes. Using crossfeed, an engine can draw fuel from a fuel tank located in  the opposite wing.  

On most multiengine airplanes, operation in the crossfeed mode is an emergency procedure used to extend airplane range and  endurance in OEI flight. There are a few models that permit crossfeed as a normal, fuel balancing technique in normal operation, but  these are not common. The AFM/POH describes crossfeed limitations and procedures that vary significantly among multiengine  airplanes.  

Checking crossfeed operation on the ground with a quick repositioning of the fuel selectors does nothing more than ensure freedom of  motion of the handle. To actually check crossfeed operation, a complete, functional crossfeed system check should be accomplished.  To do this, each engine should be operated from its crossfeed position during the run-up. The engines should be checked individually  and allowed to run at moderate power (1,500 rpm minimum) for at least 1 minute to ensure that fuel flow can be established from the  crossfeed source. Upon completion of the check, each engine should be operated for at least 1 minute at moderate power from the  main (takeoff) fuel tanks to reconfirm fuel flow prior to takeoff.  

This suggested check is not required prior to every flight. Crossfeed lines are ideal places for water and debris to accumulate unless  they are used from time to time and drained using their external drains during preflight. Crossfeed is ordinarily not used for  completing a flight with one engine inoperative when an alternate airport is nearby. Pilots should never use crossfeed during takeoff  or for normal landing operations with both engines operating. A landing with one engine inoperative using crossfeed may be  necessary if setting normal fuel flow would cause the operative engine to fail.  

# Combustion Heater  

Combustion heaters are another common item on multiengine airplanes not found on single-engine airplanes. A combustion heater is  best described as a small furnace that burns gasoline to produce heated air for occupant comfort and windshield defogging. Most are  thermostatic ally operated and have a separate hour meter to record time in service for maintenance purposes. Automatic over- temperature protection is provided by a thermal switch mounted on the unit that cannot be accessed in flight. This requires the pilot or  mechanic to visually inspect the unit for possible heat damage in order to reset the switch.  

Manufacturers often suggest a cool-down period when shutting down a combustion heater. Most heater instructions recommend that  outside air be permitted to circulate through the unit for at least 15 seconds in flight or that the ventilation fan can be operated for at  least 2 minutes on the ground. Failure to provide an adequate cool down usually trips the thermal switch and renders the heater  inoperative until the switch is reset.  

# Flight Director/Autopilot  

Multiengine airplanes are often equipped with flight director/autopilot (FD/AP) systems. The system integrates pitch, roll,  heading, altitude, and radio navigation signals in a computer. The outputs, called computed commands, are displayed on a flight  command indicator (FCI). The FCI replaces the conventional attitude indicator on the instrument panel. The FCI is occasionally  referred to as a flight director indicator (FDI) or as an attitude director indicator (ADI).  

The entire flight director/autopilot system is called an integrated flight control system (IFCS) by some manufacturers. Others may  use the term automatic flight control system (AFCS).  

The FD/AP system may be employed at the following different levels:  

⦁  Off (raw data)  ⦁  Flight director (computed commands)  ⦁  Autopilot  

With the system off, the FCI operates as an ordinary attitude indicator. On most FCIs, the command bars are biased out of view when  the FD is off. The pilot maneuvers the airplane as though the system were not installed.  

To maneuver the airplane using the FD, the pilot enters the desired modes of operation (heading, altitude, navigation (NAV)  intercept, and tracking) on the FD/AP mode controller. The computed flight commands are then displayed to the pilot through either a  single-cue or dual-cue system in the FCI. On a single-cue system,   the commands   are indicated   by   “V” bars.   On   a dual-cue system, the  commands are displayed on two separate command bars, one for pitch and one for roll. To maneuver the airplane using computed  commands,   the pilot “flies” the symbolic airplane of   the FCI    match   the steering   cues presented.  

On most systems, the FD needs to be operating to engage the autopilot. At any time thereafter, the pilot may engage the autopilot  through the mode controller. The autopilot then maneuvers the airplane to satisfy the computed commands of the FD.  

Like any computer, the FD/AP system only does what it is told. The pilot should ensure that it has been programmed properly for the  particular phase of flight desired. The armed and/or engaged modes are usually displayed on the mode controller or separate  annunciator lights. When the airplane is being hand-flown, if the FD is not being used at any particular moment, it should be off so  that the command bars are pulled from view.  

Prior to system engagement, all FD/AP computer and trim checks should be accomplished. Many newer systems cannot be engaged  without the completion of a self-test. The pilot should also be familiar with various methods of disengagement, both normal and  emergency. System details, including approvals and limitations, can be found in the supplements section of the AFM/POH.  Additionally, many avionics manufacturers can provide informative pilot operating guides upon request.  

# Yaw Damper  

The yaw damper is a servo that moves the rudder in response to inputs from a gyroscope or accelerometer that detects yaw rate or  lateral Gs, respectively. The yaw damper reduces motion about the vertical axis caused by turbulence. (Yaw dampers on swept wing  airplanes provide another, more vital function of damping Dutch roll characteristics.) Occupants feel a smoother ride, particularly if  seated in the rear of the airplane, when the yaw damper is engaged. The yaw damper should be off for takeoff and landing. There may  be additional restrictions against its use with one engine inoperative. Most yaw dampers can be engaged independently of the  autopilot.  

# Alternator/Generator  

On a multiengine aircraft, each engine has an alternator or generator installed.  Al ternator or generator paralleling circuitry matches  the output of   each   engine’s   alternator/generator   so   that the electrical system   load    shared   equally   between   them.   In   the event of an  alternator/generator failure, the inoperative unit can be isolated and the entire electrical system powered from the remaining one.  Depending upon the electrical capacity of the alternator/generator, the pilot may need to reduce the electrical load (referred to as load  shedding) when operating on a single unit. The AFM/POH contains system description and limitations.  

# Nose Baggage Compartment  

Nose baggage compartments are common on multiengine airplanes (and are even found on a few single-engine airplanes). There is  nothing strange or exotic about a nose baggage compartment, and the usual guidance concerning observation of load limits applies.  Pilots occasionally neglect to secure the latches properly. When improperly secured, the door may open and the contents may be  drawn out, usually into the propeller arc and just after takeoff. Even when the nose baggage compartment is empty, airplanes have  been lost when the pilot became distracted by the open door. Security of the nose baggage compartment latches and locks is a vital  preflight item.  

Most airplanes continue to fly with a nose baggage door open. There may be some buffeting from the disturbed airflow, and there is  an increase in noise. Pilots should never become so preoccupied with an open door (of any kind) that they fail to fly the airplane.  

Inspection of the compartment interior is another important preflight item. More than one pilot has been surprised to find a  supposedly empty compartment packed to capacity or loaded with ballast. The tow bars, engine inlet covers, windshield sun screens,  oil containers, spare chocks, and miscellaneous small hand tools that find their way into baggage compartments should be secured to  prevent damage from shifting in flight.  

# Anti-Icing/Deicing Equipment  

A n ti-icing/deicing equipment is frequently installed on multiengine airplanes and may consist of a combination of different systems.  These may be classified as either anti-icing or deicing, depending upon function. The presence of anti-icing and deicing equipment,  even though it may appear elaborate and complete, does not necessarily mean that the airplane is approved for flight in icing  conditions. The AFM/POH, placards, and even the manufacturer should be consulted for specific determination of approvals and  limitations. Anti-icing equipment is provided to prevent ice from forming on certain protected surfaces. Examples of anti-icing  equipment include heated pitot tubes, heated or non-icing static ports and fuel vents, propeller blades with electrothermal boots or  alcohol slingers, windshields with alcohol spray or electrical resistance heating, windshield defoggers, and heated stall warning lift  detectors.   On   many   turboprop   engines, the “lip” surrounding   the air   intake is   heated   either   electrically   or   with   bleed   air.   In the  absence of AFM/POH guidance to the contrary, anti-icing equipment should be actuated prior to flight into known or suspected icing  conditions.  

Deicing equipment is generally limited to pneumatic boots on wing and tail leading edges. Deicing equipment is installed to remove  ice that has already formed on protected surfaces. Upon pilot actuation, the boots inflate with air from the pneumatic pumps to break  off accumulated ice. After a few seconds of inflation, they are deflated back to their normal position with the assistance of a vacuum.  The pilot monitors the buildup of ice and cycles the boots as directed in the AFM/POH. An ice light on the left engine nacelle allows  the pilot to monitor wing ice accumulation at night.  

Other airframe equipment necessary for flight in icing conditions includes an alternate induction air source and an alternate static  system source. Ice tolerant antennas are also installed.  

In the event of impact ice accumulating over normal engine air induction sources, carburetor heat (carbureted engines) or alternate air  (fuel-injected engines) should be selected. Ice buildup on normal induction sources can be detected by a loss of engine rpm with  fixed-pitch propellers and a loss of manifold pressure with constant-speed propellers. On some fuel-injected engines, an alternate air  source is automatically activated with blockage of the normal air source.  

An alternate static system provides an alternate source of static air for the pitot-static system in the unlikely event that the primary  static source becomes blocked. In non-pressurized airplanes, most alternate static sources are plumbed to the cabin. On pressurized  airplanes, they are usually plumbed to a non-pressurized baggage compartment. The pilot may activate the alternate static source by  opening a valve or a fitting in the flight deck. Activation may create airspeed indicator, altimeter, or vertical speed indicator (VSI)  errors. A correction table is frequently provided in the AFM/POH.  

Anti-icing/deicing equipment only eliminates ice from the protected surfaces. Significant ice accumulations may form on unprotected  areas, even with proper use of anti-ice and deice systems. Flight at high angles of attack (AOA) or even normal climb speeds permit  significant ice accumulations on lower wing surfaces, which are unprotected. Many AFM/POHs provide minimum speeds to be  maintained in icing conditions. Degradation of all flight characteristics and large performance losses can be expected with ice  accumulations. Pilots should not rely upon the stall warning devices for adequate stall warning with ice accumulations.  

Ice accumulates unevenly on the airplane. It adds weight and drag (primarily drag) and decreases thrust and lift. Even wing  shape affects ice accumulation; thin airfoil sections are more prone to ice accumulation than thick, highly-cambered sections.  For this reason, certain surfaces, such as the horizontal stabilizer, are more prone to icing than the wing. With ice  accumulations, landing approaches should be made with a minimum wing flap setting (flap extension increases the AOA of the  horizontal stabilizer) and with an added margin of airspeed. Sudden and large configuration and airspeed changes should be avoided.  

Unless otherwise recommended in the AFM/POH, the autopilot should not be used in icing conditions. Continuous use of  the autopilot masks trim and handling changes that occur with ice accumulation. Without this control feedback, the pilot may  not be aware of ice accumulation building to hazardous levels. The autopilot suddenly disconnects when it reaches design limits,  and the pilot may find the airplane has assumed unsatisfactory handling characteristics.  

The installation of anti-ice/deice equipment on airplanes without AFM/POH approval for flight into icing conditions is to  facilitate escape when such conditions are inadvertently encountered. Even with AFM/POH approval, the prudent pilot avoids icing  conditions to the maximum extent practicable and avoids extended flight in any icing conditions. No multiengine airplane is approved  for flight into severe icing conditions and none are intended for indefinite flight in continuous icing conditions.  

# Performance and Limitations  

Discussion of performance and limitations requires the definition of the following terms.  

⦁  Accelerate-stop distance is the runway length required to accelerate to a specified speed  ( either   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$      or   $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$  , as specified by the manufacturer), experience an engine failure, and bring the airplane to a    complete stop.  [Figure 13-5A]  

⦁  Accelerate-go distance is the horizontal distance required to continue the takeoff and climb to 50    feet, assuming an engine failure at  $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    or  $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$  , as specified by the manufacturer.  [Figure 13-5A]  

⦁  Climb gradient is a slope most frequently expressed in terms of altitude gain per 100 feet of      horizontal distance, whereupon it is stated as a percentage. A 1.5 percent climb gradient is an      altitude gain of one and one-half feet per 100 feet of horizontal travel. Climb gradient may also be      expressed as a function of altitude gain per nautical mile (NM), or as a ratio of the horizontal      distance to the vertical distance (10:1, for example).  [Figure 13-5B]  Unlike rate of climb, climb      gradient is affected by wind. Climb gradient is improved with a headwind component and reduced      with a tailwind component.

Figure 13-5B.  Climb gradient.  

⦁  The all-engine service ceiling of multiengine airplanes is the highest altitude at which the airplane can  maintain a steady rate of climb of 100 fpm with both engines operating. The airplane has reached its  absolute ceiling when climb is no longer possible.  

⦁  The single-engine service ceiling is reached when the multiengine airplane can no longer maintain a 50 fpm  rate of climb with OEI, and its single-engine absolute ceiling when climb is no longer possible.  

The takeoff in a multiengine airplane should be planned in sufficient detail so that the appropriate action is taken in the event of an  engine failure.   The pilot should   be thoroughly   familiar   with   the airplane’s   performance   capabilities and   limitations   in   order   to make  an   informed   takeoff   decision   as part of   the preflight planning.   That decision   should   be reviewed   as the last   item   of   the “before  takeoff” checklist.  

In the event of an engine failure shortly after takeoff, the decision is basically one of continuing flight or landing, even off-airport. If  single-engine climb performance is adequate for continued flight, and the airplane has been promptly and correctly configured, the  climb after takeoff may be continued. If single-engine climb performance is such that climb is unlikely or impossible, a landing has to  be made in the most suitable area. To be avoided above all is attempting to continue flight when it is not within the airplane’s   performance capability to do so.  [Figure 13-6]  

![](images/78328587468c014e125f6e6d91defed6bd067c72275f0d75bb204f318f5a21dc.jpg)  
Figure 13-6.  Area of decision for engine failure after lift-off.  

Takeoff planning factors include weight and balance, airplane performance (both single and multiengine), runway length, slope and  contamination, terrain and obstacles in the area, weather conditions, and pilot proficiency. Most multiengine airplanes have  AFM/POH performance charts and the pilot should be proficient in their use. Prior to takeoff, the multiengine pilot should ensure that  the weight and balance limitations have been observed, the runway length is adequate, and the normal flightpath clears obstacles and  terrain. The pilot should also consider the appropriate actions expected in the event of an engine failure at any point during the  takeoff.  

The regulations do not specifically require that the runway length be equal to or greater than the accelerate-stop distance. Most  AFM/POHs publish accelerate-stop distances only as an advisory. It becomes a limitation only when published in the limitations  section of the AFM/POH. Experienced multiengine pilots, however, recognize the safety margin of runway lengths in excess of the  bare minimum required for normal takeoff, and they insist on runway lengths of at least accelerate-stop distance as a matter of safety  and good operating practice.  

The multiengine pilot considers that under ideal circumstances, the accelerate-go distance only brings the airplane to a point a mere  50 feet above the takeoff elevation. To achieve even this meager climb, the pilot had to instantaneously recognize and react to an  unanticipated engine failure, retract the landing gear, identify and feather the correct engine, all the while maintaining precise  airspeed control and bank angle as the airspeed is nursed to   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  . Assuming flawless airmanship thus far, the airplane has now  arrived at a point little more than one wingspan above the terrain, assuming it was absolutely level and without obstructions.  

For the purpose of illustration, with a near   $150~\mathrm{fpm}$   rate of climb at a 90-knot   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE},}$  ,  it takes approximately 3 minutes to climb an  additional 450 feet to reach 500 feet AGL. In doing so, the airplane has traveled an additional 5 NM beyond the original accelerate- go distance, with a climb gradient of about 1.6 percent. Any turn, such as to return to the airport, seriously degrades the already  marginal climb performance of the airplane.  

Not all multiengine airplanes have published accelerate-go distances in their AFM/POH and fewer still publish climb gradients. When  such information is published, the figures have been determined under ideal flight testing conditions. It is unlikely that this  performance is duplicated in service conditions.  

The point of the previous discussion is to illustrate the marginal climb performance of a multiengine airplane that suffers an engine  failure shortly after takeoff, even under ideal conditions. The prudent multiengine pilot should pick a decision point in the takeoff and  climb sequence in advance. If an engine fails before this point, the takeoff should be rejected, even if airborne, for a landing on  whatever runway or surface lies essentially ahead. If an engine fails after this point, the pilot should promptly execute the appropriate  engine failure procedure and continue the climb, assuming the performance capability exists. As a general recommendation, if the  landing gear has not been selected up, the takeoff should be rejected, even if airborne.  

As a practical matter for planning purposes, the option of continuing the takeoff probably does not exist unless the published single- engine rate-of-climb performance is at least 100 to 200 fpm. Thermal turbulence, wind gusts, engine and propeller wear, or poor  technique in airspeed, bank angle, and rudder control can easily negate even a 200 fpm rate of climb.  

A pre-takeoff safety brief clearly defines all pre-planned emergency actions to all crewmembers. Even if operating the aircraft alone,  the pilot should review and be familiar with takeoff emergency considerations. Indecision at the moment an emergency occurs  degrades reaction time and the ability to make a proper response.  

# Weight and Balance  

The weight and balance concept is no different than that of a single-engine airplane. The actual execution, however, is almost  invariably more complex due to a number of new loading areas, including nose and aft baggage compartments, nacelle lockers, main  fuel tanks, auxiliary fuel tanks, nacelle fuel tanks, and numerous seating options in a variety of interior configurations. The flexibility in  loading offered by the multiengine airplane places a responsibility on the pilot to address weight and balance prior to each flight.  

The terms empty weight, licensed empty weight, standard empty weight, and basic empty weight as they appear on the manufacturer’s  original weight and balance documents are sometimes confused by pilots.  

In 1975, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) adopted a standardized format for AFM/POHs. It was  implemented by most manufacturers in model year 1976. Airplanes whose manufacturers conform to the GAMA standards utilize the  following terminology for weight and balance:  

standard empty weight  $^+$   optional equipment  $=$  basic empty weight  

Standard empty weight is the weight of the standard airplane, full hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and full oil. Optional equipment  includes the weight of all equipment installed beyond standard. Basic empty weight is the standard empty weight plus optional  equipment. Note that basic empty weight includes no usable fuel, but full oil.  

Airplanes manufactured prior to the GAMA format generally utilize the following terminology for weight and balance, although the  exact terms may vary somewhat:  

empty weight  $^+$   unusable fuel  $=$  standard empty weight  

standard empty weight  $^+$   optional equipment  $=$   licensed empty weight  

Empty weight is the weight of the standard airplane, full hydraulic fluid, and undrainable oil. Unusable fuel is the fuel remaining in  the airplane not available to the engines. Standard empty weight is the empty weight plus unusable fuel. When optional equipment is  added to the standard empty weight, the result is licensed empty weight. Licensed empty weight, therefore, includes the standard  airplane, optional equipment, full hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and undrainable oil.  

The major difference between the two formats (GAMA and the old) is that basic empty weight includes full oil and licensed empty  weight does not. Oil should always be added to any weight and balance utilizing a licensed empty weight.  

When the airplane is placed in service, amended weight and balance documents are prepared by appropriately-rated maintenance  personnel to   reflect changes in   installed   equipment. The old   weight and   balance   documents   are customarily   marked   “superseded”   and  retained in the AFM/POH. Maintenance personnel are under no regulatory obligation to utilize the GAMA terminology, so weight  and balance documents subsequent to the original may use a variety of terms. Pilots should use care to determine whether or not oil  has to be added to the weight and balance calculations or if it is already included in the figures provided.  

The multiengine airplane is   where most pilots   encounter   the term   “zero   fuel weight” for   the first time.   Not all multiengine airplanes  have a zero fuel weight limitation published in their AFM/POH, but many do. Zero fuel weight is simply the maximum allowable  weight of the airplane and payload, assuming there is no usable fuel on board. The actual airplane is not devoid of fuel at the time of  loading, of course. This is merely a calculation that assumes it was. If a zero fuel weight limitation is published, then all weight in  excess of that figure should consist of usable fuel. The purpose of a zero fuel weight is to limit load forces on the wing spars with  heavy fuselage loads.  

Assume a hypothetical multiengine airplane with the following weights and capacities:  

Basic empty weight 3,200 lbs  Zero fuel weight 4,400 lbs  Maximum takeoff weight 5,200 lbs  Maximum usable fuel 180 gal  

1.  Calculate the useful load:  

Maximum takeoff weight 5,200 lbs  Basic empty weight  $_{-3,200}$   lbs  Useful load 2,000 lbs  

The useful load is the maximum combination of usable fuel, passengers, baggage, and cargo that the airplane is capable of carrying.  

2. Calculate the payload:  

Zero fuel weight 4,400 lbs  Basic empty weight –3,200 lbs  Payload 1,200 lbs  

The payload is the maximum combination of passengers, baggage, and cargo that the airplane is capable of carrying. A zero fuel  weight, if published, is the limiting weight.  

3. Calculate the fuel capacity at maximum payload (1,200 lb):  

Maximum takeoff weight 5,200 lbs  Zero fuel weight –4,400 lbs  Fuel allowed 800 lbs  

Assuming maximum payload, the only weight permitted in excess of the zero fuel weight should consist of usable fuel. In this case, 

 133.3 gallons (gal).  

4. Calculate the payload at maximum fuel capacity (180 gal):  Basic empty weight 3,200 lbs  Maximum usable fuel   $_{+1,080}$   lbs  Weight with max. fuel 4,280 lbs  Maximum takeoff weight 5,200 lbs  Weight with max. fuel –4,280 lbs  Payload allowed 920 lbs  

Assuming maximum fuel, the payload is the difference between the weight of the fueled airplane and the maximum takeoff weight.  

Some multiengine airplanes have a ramp weight, which is in excess of the maximum takeoff weight. The ramp weight allows for fuel  that would be burned during taxi and run-up, permitting a takeoff at full maximum takeoff weight. The airplane should weigh no more  than maximum takeoff weight at the beginning of the takeoff roll.  

A maximum landing weight is a limitation against landing at a weight in excess of the published value. This requires preflight  planning of fuel burn to ensure that the airplane weight upon arrival at destination is at or below the maximum landing weight. In the  event of an emergency requiring an immediate landing, the pilot should recognize that the structural margins designed into the  airplane are not fully available when over landing weight. An overweight landing inspection may be advisable—the service manual or  manufacturer should be consulted.  

Although the foregoing problems only dealt with weight, the balance portion of weight and balance is equally vital. The flight  characteristics of the multiengine airplane vary significantly with shifts of the center of gravity (CG) within the approved envelope.  

At forward CG, the airplane is more stable, with a slightly higher stalling speed, a slightly slower cruising speed, and favorable stall  characteristics. At aft CG, the airplane is less stable, with a slightly lower stalling speed, a slightly faster cruising speed, and less  desirable stall characteristics. Forward CG limits are usually determined in certification by elevator/stabilator authority in the landing  round   out. Aft CG limits   are determined   by   the minimum   acceptable longitudinal stability.   It is   contrary   to   the airplane’s   operating  limitations and 14 CFR to exceed any weight and balance parameter.  

Some multiengine airplanes may require ballast to remain within CG limits under certain loading conditions. Several models require  ballast in the aft baggage compartment with only a learner and instructor on board to avoid exceeding the forward CG limit. When  passengers are seated in the aft-most seats of some models, ballast or baggage may be required in the nose baggage compartment to  avoid exceeding the aft CG limit. The pilot should direct the seating of passengers and placement of baggage and cargo to achieve a  CG within the approved envelope. Most multiengine airplanes have general loading recommendations in the weight and balance  section of the AFM/POH. When ballast is added, it should be securely tied down, and it should not exceed the maximum allowable  floor loading.  

Some airplanes make use of a special weight and balance plotter. It consists of several movable parts that can be adjusted over a  plotting board on which the CG envelope is printed. The reverse side of the typical plotter contains general loading recommendations  for the particular airplane. A pencil line plot can be made directly on the CG envelope imprinted on the working side of the plotting  board. This plot can easily be erased and recalculated anew for each flight. This plotter is to be used only for the make and model  airplane for which it was designed.  

# Ground Operation  

Good habits learned with single-engine airplanes are directly applicable to multiengine airplanes for preflight and engine start. Upon  placing the airplane in motion to taxi, the new multiengine pilot may notice several differences. The most obvious is the increased  wingspan and the need for even greater vigilance while taxiing in close quarters. Ground handling may seem somewhat ponderous  and the multiengine airplane is not as nimble as the typical two- or four-place single-engine airplane. As always, the pilot should use  care not to ride the brakes by keeping engine power to a minimum. One ground handling advantage of the multiengine airplane over  single-engine airplanes is the differential power capability. Turning with an assist from differential power minimizes both the need for  brakes during turns and the turning radius.  

The pilot should be aware, however, that making a sharp turn assisted by brakes and differential power can cause the airplane to pivot  about a stationary inboard wheel and landing gear. The airplane was not designed for this action, and the pilot should not allow it to  occur. Unless otherwise directed by the AFM/POH, all ground operations should be conducted with the cowl flaps fully open. The  use of strobe lights is normally deferred until taxiing onto the active runway.  

# Normal and Crosswind Takeoff and Climb  

After completing the before takeoff checklist and pre-takeoff safety brief, and after receiving an air traffic control (ATC) clearance (if  applicable), the pilot should check for approaching aircraft and line up on the runway centerline. If departing from an airport without  an operating control tower, the pilot should listen on the appropriate frequency, make a careful check for traffic, and transmit a radio  advisory before entering the runway. Sharp turns onto the runway combined with a rolling takeoff are not a good operating practice  and may be prohibited by the AFM/POH due to the possibility of “unporting” a fuel tank pickup. The takeoff itself may be prohibited  by the AFM/POH under any circumstances below certain fuel levels. The flight controls should be positioned for a  crosswind,  if present. Exterior lights, such as landing and taxi lights, and wingtip strobes should be illuminated immediately prior to  initiating the takeoff roll, day or night. If holding in takeoff position for any length of time, particularly at night, the pilot  should activate all exterior lights upon taxiing into position.  

Takeoff power should be set as recommended in the AFM/POH. With normally aspirated (non-turbocharged) engines, this is  full throttle. Full throttle is also used in most turbocharged engines. There are some turbocharged engines, however, that require the  pilot to set a specific power setting, usually just below red line manifold pressure. This yields takeoff power with less than full  throttle travel. Turbocharged engines often require special consideration. Throttle motion with turbocharged engines should be  exceptionally smooth and deliberate. It is acceptable, and may even be desirable, to hold the airplane in position with brakes as  the throttles are advanced. Brake release customarily occurs after significant boost from the turbocharger is established. This  prevents utilizing the available runway with slow, partial throttle acceleration as the engine power is increased. If runway length  or obstacle clearance is critical, full power should be set before brake release as specified in the performance charts. Note that for all  airplanes equipped with constant speed propellers, the engines can turn at maximum rpm and can develop maximum engine  power before brake release. Although the mass of air per revolution is small, the number of rpm is high and propeller thrust is  maximized. Thrust is at a maximum at the beginning of the takeoff roll and then decreases as the airplane gains speed. The  high slipstream velocity during takeoff increases the effective lift of the wing behind the propeller(s).  

As takeoff power is established, initial attention should be divided between tracking the runway centerline and monitoring the engine  gauges. Many novice multiengine pilots tend to fixate on the airspeed indicator just as soon as the airplane begins its takeoff  roll. Instead, the pilot should confirm that both engines are developing full-rated manifold pressure and rpm, and that as the fuel  flows, fuel pressures, exhaust gas temperatures (EGTs), and oil pressures are matched in their normal ranges. A directed and  purposeful scan of the engine gauges can be accomplished well before the airplane approaches rotation speed. If a crosswind is  present, the aileron displacement in the direction of the crosswind may be reduced as the airplane accelerates. The elevator/  stabilator control should be held neutral throughout.  

Full rated takeoff power should be used for every takeoff. Partial power takeoffs are not recommended. There is no evidence  to suggest that the life of modern reciprocating engines is prolonged by partial power takeoffs. In actuality, excessive heat and  engine wear can occur with partial power as the fuel metering system fails to deliver the slightly over-rich mixture vital for engine  cooling during takeoff.  

There are several key airspeeds to be noted during the takeoff and climb sequence in any twin. The first speed to consider is   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . If  an engine fails below   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    while the airplane is on the ground, the takeoff needs to be rejected. Directional control can only be  maintained by promptly closing both throttles and using rudder and brakes as required. If an engine fails below   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    while airborne,  directional control is not possible with the remaining engine producing takeoff power. On takeoffs, therefore, the airplane  should never be airborne before the airspeed exceeds  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . Pilots should use the manufacturer’s recommended rotation speed   $(\mathrm{V_{R})}$   or  lift-off speed   $(\mathrm{V_{LOF}})$  . If no such speeds are published, a minimum of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    plus 5 knots should be used for  $\mathrm{V_{R}}$  .  

The rotation to a takeoff pitch attitude is performed with smooth control inputs. With a crosswind, the pilot should ensure that  the landing gear does not momentarily touch the runway after the airplane has lifted off, as a side drift is present. The rotation  may be accomplished more positively and/or at a higher speed under these conditions. However, the pilot should keep in mind  that the AFM/POH performance figures for accelerate-stop distance, takeoff ground roll, and distance to clear an obstacle were  calculated at the recommended   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    and/or   $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$    speed.  

After lift-off, the next consideration is to gain altitude as rapidly as possible. To assist the pilot in takeoff and initial climb  profile, some AFM/POHs give a   $^{\circ}50$  -foot” or “50-foot barrier” speed to use as a target during rotation, lift-off, and acceleration to   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  . Prior to takeoff, pilots should review the takeoff distance to 50 feet above ground level (AGL) and the stopping distance from 50  feet AGL and add the distance together. If the runway is no longer than the total value, the odds are very good that if anything fails, it  will be an off-runway landing at the least. After leaving the ground, altitude gain is more important than achieving an excess  of airspeed. Experience has shown that excessive speed cannot be effectively converted into altitude in the event of an engine failure.  Additional altitude increases the time available to recognize and respond to any aircraft abnormality or emergency during the climb  segment.  

Excessive climb attitudes can be just as dangerous as excessive airspeed. Steep climb attitudes limit forward visibility and impede the  pilot’s ability to detect and avoid other traffic. The airplane should be allowed to accelerate in a shallow climb to attain   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , the best  all-engine rate-of-climb speed.   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    should then be maintained until achieving a safe single-engine maneuvering altitude, which  considers terrain and obstructions. Any speed above or below   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    reduces the performance of the airplane. Even with all engines  operating normally, terrain and obstruction clearance during the initial climb after takeoff is an important preflight consideration.  Most airliners and most turbine-powered airplanes climb out at an attitude that yields best rate of climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   usually utilizing a flight  management system (FMS).  

When to raise the landing gear after takeoff depends on several factors. Normally, the gear should be retracted when there is  insufficient runway available for landing and after a positive rate of climb is established as indicated on the altimeter. If an excessive  amount of runway is available, it would not be prudent to leave the landing gear down for an extended period of time and sacrifice  climb performance and acceleration. Leaving the gear extended after the point at which a landing cannot be accomplished on the  runway is a hazard. In some multiengine airplanes, operating in a high-density altitude environment, a positive rate of climb with the  landing gear down is not possible. Waiting for a positive rate of climb under these conditions is not practicable. An important point to  remember is that raising the landing gear as early as possible after liftoff drastically decreases the drag profile and significantly  increases climb performance should an engine failure occur. An equally important point to remember is that leaving the gear down to  land on sufficient runway or overrun is a much better option than landing with the gear retracted. A general recommendation is to  raise the landing gear not later than   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  airspeed, and once the gear is up, consider it a GO commitment if climb performance is  available. Some AFM/POHs direct the pilot to apply the wheel brakes momentarily after lift-off to stop wheel rotation prior to  landing gear retraction. If flaps were extended for takeoff, they should be retracted as recommended in the AFM/POH.  

Once a safe, single-engine maneuvering altitude has been reached, typically a minimum of 400 — 500 feet AGL, the transition to an en  route climb speed should be made. This speed is higher than   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    and is usually maintained to cruising altitude. En route climb speed  gives better visibility, increased engine cooling, and a higher groundspeed. Takeoff power can be reduced, if desired, as the transition  to en route climb speed is made.  

Some airplanes have a climb power setting published in the AFM/POH as a recommendation (or sometimes as a limitation), which  should then be set for en route climb. If there is no climb power setting published, it is customary, but not a requirement, to reduce  manifold pressure and rpm somewhat for en route climb. The propellers are usually synchronized after the first power reduction and  the yaw damper, if installed, engaged. The AFM/POH may also recommend leaning the mixtures during climb. The climb checklist  should be accomplished as traffic and work load allow.  [Figure 13-7]

Figure 13-7.  Takeoff and climb profile.  

# Short-Field Takeoff and Climb  

The short-field takeoff and climb differs from the normal takeoff and climb in the airspeeds and initial climb profile. Some  AFM/POHs give separate short-field takeoff procedures and performance charts that recommend specific flap settings and airspeeds.  Other AFM/POHs do not provide separate short-field procedures. In the absence of such specific procedures, the airplane should be  operated only as recommended in the AFM/POH. No operations should be conducted contrary to the recommendations in the  AFM/POH.  

On short-field takeoffs in general, just after rotation and lift-off, the airplane should be allowed to accelerate to   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  , making the initial  climb over obstacles at   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  and transitioning to  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  as obstacles are cleared.  [Figure 13-8]  

![](images/e7292a7285fbf47d93a5bbd7d1a39165996372e954c24e25819364591fa585db.jpg)  
Figure 13-8.  Short-field takeoff and climb  

When partial flaps are recommended for short-field takeoffs, many light-twins have a strong tendency to become airborne prior to   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    plus 5 knots. Attempting to prevent premature lift-off with forward elevator pressure results in wheel barrowing. To prevent  this, allow the airplane to become airborne, but only a few inches above the runway. The pilot should be prepared to promptly abort  the takeoff and land in the event of engine failure on takeoff with landing gear and flaps extended at airspeeds below   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  .  

Engine failure on takeoff, particularly with obstructions, is compounded by the low airspeeds and steep climb attitudes utilized in  short-field takeoffs.   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    and   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{KSE}}$    are often perilously close to   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  , leaving scant margin for error in the event of engine failure as   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{KSE}}$    is assumed. If flaps were used for takeoff, the engine failure situation becomes even more critical due to the additional drag  incurred. If   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    is less than 5 knots higher than   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  , give strong consideration to reducing useful load or using another runway in  order to increase the takeoff margins so that a short-field technique is not required.  

# Rejected Takeoff  

A takeoff can be rejected for the same reasons a takeoff in a single-engine airplane would be rejected. Once the decision to reject a  takeoff is made, the pilot should promptly close both throttles and maintain directional control with the rudder, nose-wheel steering,  and brakes. Aggressive use of rudder, nose-wheel steering, and brakes may be required to keep the airplane on the runway,  particularly if an engine failure is not immediately recognized and accompanied by prompt closure of both throttles. However, the  primary objective is not necessarily to stop the airplane in the shortest distance, but to maintain control of the airplane as it  decelerates. In some situations, it may be preferable to continue into the overrun area under control, rather than risk directional  control loss, landing gear collapse, or tire/brake failure in an attempt to stop the airplane in the shortest possible distance.  

# Level Off and Cruise  

Upon leveling off at cruising altitude, the pilot should allow the airplane to accelerate at climb power until cruising airspeed is  achieved, and then cruise power and rpm should be set. To extract the maximum cruise performance from any airplane, the power  setting tables provided by the manufacturer should be closely followed. If the cylinder head and oil temperatures are within their  normal ranges, the cowl flaps may be closed. When the engine temperatures have stabilized, the mixtures may be leaned per  AFM/POH recommendations. The remainder of the cruise checklist should be completed by this point.  

Fuel management in multiengine airplanes is often more complex than in single-engine airplanes. Depending upon system design, the  pilot may need to select between main tanks and auxiliary tanks or even employ fuel transfer from one tank to another. In complex  fuel systems, limitations are often found restricting the use of some tanks to level flight only or requiring a reserve of fuel in the main  tanks for descent and landing. Electric fuel pump operation can also vary widely among different models, particularly during tank  switching or fuel transfer. Some fuel pumps are to be on for takeoff and landing; others are to be off. There is simply no substitute for  thorough systems and AFM/POH knowledge when operating complex aircraft.  

# Slow Flight  

There is nothing unusual about maneuvering during slow flight in a multiengine airplane. Slow flight may be conducted in straight­ and-level flight, turns, climbs, or descents. It can also be conducted in the clean configuration, landing configuration, or at any other  combination of landing gear and flaps. Slow flight in a multiengine airplane should be conducted so the maneuver can be completed  no lower than 3,000 feet AGL or higher if recommended by the manufacturer. In all cases, practicing slow flight should be conducted  at an adequate height above the ground for recovery should the airplane inadvertently stall.  

Pilots should closely monitor cylinder head and oil temperatures during slow flight. Some high performance multiengine airplanes  tend to heat up fairly quickly under some conditions of slow flight, particularly in the landing configuration. Simulated engine failures  should not be conducted during slow flight. The airplane will be well below   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$  and very close to   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . Stability, stall warning, or  stall avoidance devices should not be disabled while maneuvering during slow flight.  

# Spin Awareness and Stalls  

No multiengine airplane is approved for spins, and their spin recovery characteristics are generally very poor. It is therefore prudent to  practice spin avoidance and maintain a high awareness of situations that can result in an inadvertent spin.  

# Spin Awareness  

In order to spin any airplane, a stalled condition needs to exist. At the stall, the presence or introduction of a yawing moment can  initiate spin entry. In a multiengine airplane, the yawing moment may be generated by rudder input or asymmetrical thrust. It follows,  then, that spin awareness be at its greatest during   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstrations, stall practice, slow flight, or any condition of high  asymmetrical thrust, particularly at low speed/high AOA. Single-engine stalls are not part of any multiengine training curriculum.  

No engine failure should ever be introduced below safe, intentional one-engine inoperative speed   $(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}})$  . If no   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$    is published, use   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  . Other than training situations, the multiengine airplane is only operated below   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$    for mere seconds just after lift-off or during  the last few dozen feet of altitude in preparation for landing.  

For spin avoidance when practicing engine failures, the flight instructor should pay strict attention to the maintenance of proper  airspeed and bank angle as the learner executes the appropriate procedure. The instructor should also be particularly alert during stall  and slow flight practice. While flying with a center-of-gravity closer to the forward limit provides better stall and spin avoidance  characteristics, it does not eliminate the hazard.  

When performing a   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration, the instructor should also be alert for any sign of an impending stall. The learner may be  highly focused on the directional control aspect of the maneuver to the extent that impending stall indications go unnoticed. If a   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  demonstration cannot be accomplished under existing conditions of density altitude, the instructor may, for training purposes, utilize a  rudder blocking technique.  

As very few twins have ever been spin-tested (none are required to), the recommended spin recovery techniques are based only on the  best information available. The departure from controlled flight may be quite abrupt and possibly disorienting. The direction of an  upright spin can be confirmed from the turn needle or the symbolic airplane of the turn coordinator, if necessary. Do not rely on the  ball position or other instruments.  

If a spin is entered, most manufacturers recommend immediately retarding both throttles to idle, applying full rudder opposite the  direction of rotation, and applying full forward elevator/stabilator pressure (with ailerons neutral). These actions should be taken as  near simultaneously as possible. The controls should then be held in that position until the spin has stopped. At that point adjust  rudder pressure, back elevator pressure, and power as necessary to return to the desired flight path. Pilots should be aware that a spin  recovery will take considerable altitude; therefore, it is critical that corrective action be taken immediately.  

# Stall Training  

It is recommended that stalls be practiced at an altitude that allows recovery no lower than 3,000 feet AGL for multiengine airplanes,  or higher if recommended by the AFM/POH. Losing altitude during recovery from a stall is to be expected.  

Stall characteristics vary among multiengine airplanes just as they do with single-engine airplanes, and therefore, a pilot should be  familiar with them. Yet, the most important stall recovery step in a multiengine airplane is the same as it is in all airplanes: reduce the  angle of attack (AOA). For reference, the stall recovery procedure described in Chapter 5 is included in  Figure 13-9 . Following a  reduction in the AOA and the stall warning being eliminated, the wings should be rolled level and power added as needed. Immediate  full application of power in a stalled condition has an associated risk due to the possibility of asymmetric thrust. In addition, single- engine stalls, or stalls with significantly more power on one engine than the other, should not be attempted due to the likelihood of a  departure from controlled flight and possible spin entry. Similarly, simulated engine failures should not be performed during stall  entry and recovery.  

![Figure 13-9.  Stall recovery procedure.  ](images/6b9b25e1001401a2a3c14a57aa61dfc6db05ee7f2c8271b108ca12ff79ad63d4.jpg)  

# Power-Off Approach to Stall (Approach and Landing)  

A power-off approach to stall is trained and checked to simulate problematic approach and landing scenarios. A power-off approach  to stall may be performed with wings level, or from shallow turns (up to 20 degrees of bank). To initiate a power-off approach to stall  maneuver, the area surrounding the airplane should first be cleared for possible traffic. The airplane should then be slowed and  configured for an approach and landing. A stabilized descent should be established (approximately   $500~\mathrm{fpm}$  ) and trim adjusted. A  turn should be initiated at this point, if desired. The pilot should then smoothly increase the AOA to induce a stall warning. Power is  reduced further during this phase, and trimming should cease at speeds slower than takeoff.  

When the airplane reaches the stall warning (e.g., aural alert, buffet, etc.), the recovery is accomplished by first reducing the AOA  until the stall warning is eliminated. The pilot then rolls the wings level with coordinated use of the rudder and smoothly  applies power as required. The airplane should be accelerated to   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  (if simulated obstacles are present) or   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  during recovery and  climb. Considerable forward elevator/stabilator pressure will be required after the stall recovery as the airplane accelerates to   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    or   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  . Appropriate trim input should be anticipated. The flap setting should be reduced from full to approach, or as recommended  by the manufacturer. Then, with a positive rate of climb, the landing gear is selected up. The remaining flaps are then retracted as a  positive rate-of-climb continues.  

# Power-On Approach to Stall (Takeoff and Departure)  

A power-on approach to stall is trained and checked to simulate problematic takeoff scenarios. A power-on approach to stall may be  performed from straight-and-level flight or from shallow and medium banked turns (up to 20 degrees of bank). To initiate a power-on  approach to stall maneuver, the area surrounding the airplane should always be cleared to look for potential traffic. The airplane is  slowed   to   the   manufacturer’s   recommended   lift-off speed. The airplane should be configured in the takeoff configuration. Trim  should be adjusted for this speed. Engine power is then increased to that recommended in the AFM/POH for the practice of power-on  approach to stall. In the absence of a recommended setting, use approximately 65 percent of maximum available power. Begin a turn,  if desired, while increasing AOA to induce a stall warning (e.g., aural alert, buffet, etc.). Other specified (reduced) power settings  may be used to simulate performance at higher gross weights and density altitudes.  

When the airplane reaches the stall warning, the recovery is made first by reducing the AOA until the stall warning is eliminated. The  pilot then rolls the wings level with coordinated use of the rudder and applying power as needed. However, if simulating limited  power available for high gross weight and density altitude situations, the power during the recovery should be limited to that  specified. The landing gear should be retracted when a positive rate of climb is attained, and flaps retracted, if flaps were set  for takeoff. The target airspeed on recovery is   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$    if (simulated) obstructions are present, or   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  . The pilot should anticipate the need  for nose-down trim as the airplane accelerates to   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   or   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   after recovery.  

It is not recommended that full stalls be practiced unless a qualified flight instructor is present. A power-off or power-on full stall  should only be practiced in a structured lesson with clear learning objectives and cautions discussed. The goals of the training are (a)  to provide the pilots the experience of the handling characteristics and dynamic cues (e.g., buffet, roll off) near and at full stall and (b)  to reinforce the proper application of the stall recovery procedures. Given the associated risk of asymmetric thrust at high angles of  attack and low rudder effectiveness due to low airspeeds, this reinforces the primary step of first lowering the AOA, which allows all  control surfaces to become more effective and allows for roll to be better controlled. Thrust should only be used as needed in the  recovery.  

# Accelerated Approach to Stall  

Accelerated approach to stall should be performed with a bank of approximately   $45^{\circ}$  , and in no case at a speed greater than the  airplane manufacturer’s recommended airspeed, the specified design maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$  , or operating maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{O})}$  . The pilot should s elect an entry altitude that will allow completion of the maneuver no lower than 3,000 feet AGL.  

The entry method for the maneuver is no different than for a single-engine airplane. Once at an appropriate speed, begin increasing  the back pressure on the elevator while maintaining a coordinated   $45^{\circ}$   turn. A good speed reduction rate is approximately 3 to 5 knots  per second. Once a stall warning occurs, recover promptly by reducing the AOA until the stall warning stops. Then, roll the wings  level with coordinated rudder and add power as necessary to return to the desired flightpath.  

# Normal Approach and Landing  

Given the higher cruising speed (and frequently altitude) of multiengine airplanes over most single-engine airplanes, the descent  needs to be planned in advance. A hurried, last minute descent with power at or near idle is inefficient and can cause excessive engine  cooling. It may also lead to passenger discomfort, particularly if the airplane is unpressurized. As a rule of thumb, if terrain and  passenger conditions permit, a maximum of a 500 fpm rate of descent should be planned. Pressurized airplanes can plan for higher  descent rates, if desired.  

In a descent, some airplanes require a minimum EGT or may have a minimum power setting or cylinder head temperature to  maintain. In any case, combinations of very low manifold pressure and high rpm settings are strongly discouraged by engine  manufacturers. If higher descent rates are necessary, the pilot should consider extending partial flaps or lowering the landing gear  before retarding the power excessively. The descent checklist should be initiated upon leaving cruising altitude and completed before  arrival in the terminal area. Upon arrival in the terminal area, pilots are encouraged to turn on their landing and recognition lights  when operating below 10,000 feet, day or night, and especially when operating within 10 miles of any airport or in conditions of  reduced visibility.  

The traffic pattern and approach are typically flown at somewhat higher indicated airspeeds in a multiengine airplane contrasted to  most single-engine airplanes. The pilot may allow for this through an early start on the before-landing checklist. This provides time  for proper planning, spacing, and thinking well ahead of the airplane. Many multiengine airplanes have partial flap extension speeds  above   $\mathrm{V_{FE}}.$  , and partial flaps can be deployed prior to traffic pattern entry. Normally, the landing gear should be selected and  confirmed down when abeam the intended point of landing as the downwind leg is flown.  [Figure 13-10]  

The FAA recommends a stabilized approach concept. To the greatest extent practical, on final approach and within 500 feet AGL, the  airplane should be on speed, in trim, configured for landing, tracking the extended centerline of the runway, and established in a  constant angle of descent toward an aim point in the touchdown zone. Absent unusual flight conditions, only minor corrections are  required to maintain this approach to the round out and touchdown.  

The final approach should be made with power and at a speed recommended by the manufacturer; if a recommended speed is  not furnished, the speed should be no slower than the single-engine best rate-of-climb speed   $\mathrm{(V_{YSE})}$   until short final with the  landing assured, but in no case less than critical engine-out minimum control speed   $\mathrm{(V_{MC})}$  . Some multiengine pilots prefer to delay  full flap extension to short final with the landing assured. This is an acceptable technique with appropriate experience and familiarity  with the airplane.  

In the round out for landing, residual power is gradually reduced to idle. With the higher wing loading of multiengine airplanes and  with the drag from two windmilling propellers, there is minimal float. Full stall landings are generally undesirable in twins. The  airplane should be held off as with a high performance single-engine model, allowing touchdown of the main wheels prior to a full  stall.  

![](images/96638c058d9e162e504c964bba442a607ccf418f5404fa145d0102f41eb6bbde.jpg)  
Figure 13-10.  Normal two-engine approach and landing.  

Under favorable wind and runway conditions, the nose-wheel can be held off for best aerodynamic braking. Even as the nose-wheel is  gently lowered to the runway centerline, continued elevator back pressure greatly assists the wheel brakes in stopping the airplane.  

If runway length is critical, or with a strong crosswind, or if the surface is contaminated with water, ice, or snow, it is undesirable to  rely solely on aerodynamic braking after touchdown. The full weight of the airplane should be placed on the wheels as soon as  practicable. The wheel brakes are more effective than aerodynamic braking alone in decelerating the airplane.  

Once on the ground, elevator back pressure should be used to place additional weight on the main wheels. When necessary, wing flap  retraction also adds additional weight to the wheels and improves braking effectivity. Flap retraction during the landing rollout is  discouraged, however, unless there is a clear, operational need. It should not be accomplished as routine with each landing.  

Some multiengine airplanes, particularly those of the cabin class variety, can be flown through the round out and touchdown with a  small amount of power. This is an acceptable technique to prevent high sink rates and to cushion the touchdown. The pilot should  keep in mind, however, that the primary purpose in landing is to get the airplane down and stopped. This technique should only be  attempted when there is a generous margin of runway length. As propeller blast flows directly over the wings, lift as well as thrust is  produced. The pilot should taxi clear of the runway as soon as speed and safety permit, and then accomplish the after-landing  checklist. Ordinarily, no attempt should be made to retract the wing flaps or perform other checklist duties until the airplane has been  brought to a halt when clear of the active runway. Exceptions to this would be the rare operational needs discussed above, to relieve  the weight from the wings and place it on the wheels. In these cases, AFM/POH guidance should be followed. The pilot should not  indiscriminately reach out for any switch or control on landing rollout. An inadvertent landing gear retraction while meaning to retract  the wing flaps may result.  

# Crosswind Approach and Landing  

The multiengine airplane is often easier to land in a crosswind than a single-engine airplane due to its higher approach and landing  speed. In any event, the principles are no different between singles and twins. Prior to touchdown, the longitudinal axis should be  aligned with the runway centerline to avoid landing gear side loads.  

The two primary methods, crab and wing-low, are typically used in conjunction with each other. As soon as the airplane rolls out onto  final approach, the crab angle to track the extended runway centerline is established. This is coordinated flight with adjustments to  heading to compensate for wind drift either left or right. Prior to touchdown, the transition to a sideslip is made with the upwind wing  lowered and opposite rudder applied to prevent a turn. The airplane touches down on the landing gear of the upwind wing first,  followed by that of the downwind wing, and then the nose gear. Follow-through with the flight controls involves an increasing  application of aileron into the wind until full control deflection is reached.  

The point at which the transition from the crab to the sideslip is made is dependent upon pilot familiarity with the airplane and  experience. With high skill and experience levels, the transition can be made during the round out just before touchdown. With lesser  skill and experience levels, the transition is made at increasing distances from the runway. Some multiengine airplanes (as some  single-engine airplanes) have AFM/POH limitations against slips in excess of a certain time period; 30 seconds, for example. This is to  prevent engine power loss from fuel starvation as the fuel in the tank of the lowered wing flows toward the wingtip, away from the  fuel pickup point. This time limit should be observed if the wing-low method is utilized.  

Some multiengine pilots prefer to use differential power to assist in crosswind landings. The asymmetrical thrust produces a yawing  moment little different from that produced by the rudder. When the upwind wing is lowered, power on the upwind engine is increased  to prevent the airplane from turning. This alternate technique is completely acceptable, but most pilots feel they can react to changing  wind conditions quicker with rudder and aileron than throttle movement. This is especially true with turbocharged engines where the  throttle response may lag momentarily. The differential power technique should be practiced with an instructor before being  attempted alone.  

# Short-Field Approach and Landing  

The primary elements of a short-field approach and landing do not differ significantly from a normal approach and landing. Many  manufacturers do not publish short-field landing techniques or performance charts in the AFM/POH. In the absence of specific short- field approach and landing procedures, the airplane should be operated as recommended in the AFM/POH. No operations should be  conducted contrary to the AFM/POH recommendations.  

The emphasis in a short-field approach is on configuration (full flaps), a stabilized approach with a constant angle of descent, and  precise airspeed control. As part of a short-field approach and landing procedure, some AFM/POHs recommend a slightly slower  than normal approach airspeed. If no such slower speed is published, use the AFM/POH-recommended normal approach speed.  

Full flaps are used to provide the steepest approach angle. If obstacles are present, the approach should be planned so that no drastic  power reductions are required after they are cleared. The power should be smoothly reduced to idle in the round out prior to  touchdown. Pilots should keep in mind that the propeller blast blows over the wings providing some lift in addition to thrust.  Reducing power significantly, just after obstacle clearance, usually results in a sudden, high sink rate that may lead to a hard landing.  After the short-field touchdown, maximum stopping effort is achieved by retracting the wing flaps, adding back pressure to the  elevator/stabilator, and applying heavy braking. However, if the runway length permits, the wing flaps should be left in the extended  position until the airplane has been stopped clear of the runway. There is always a significant risk of retracting the landing gear  instead of the wing flaps when flap retraction is attempted on the landing rollout.  

Landing conditions that involve a short field, high winds, or strong crosswinds are just about the only situations where flap retraction  on the landing rollout should be considered. When there is an operational need to retract the flaps just after touchdown, it needs to be  done deliberately with the flap handle positively identified before it is moved.  

# Go-Around  

When the decision to go around is made, the throttles should be advanced to takeoff power and pitch adjusted to arrest the sink rate.  With adequate airspeed, the airplane should be placed in a climb pitch attitude. These actions, which are accomplished sequentially,  arrest the sink rate and place the airplane in the proper attitude for transition to a climb. The initial target airspeed is   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  or   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  if  obstructions are present. With sufficient airspeed, the flaps should be retracted from full to an intermediate position and the landing  gear retracted when there is a positive rate of climb and no chance of runway contact. The remaining flaps should then be retracted.  [Figure 13-11]  

![](images/7da9ab9198477e3bbb0cdf8e2de86d91259f7e85206a5da1b73c86778b21dbec.jpg)  
Figure 13-11.  Go-around procedure.  

If the go-around was initiated due to conflicting traffic on the ground or aloft, the pilot should consider maneuvering to the side to  keep the conflicting traffic in sight. This may involve a slight turn to offset from the runway/landing area.  

If the airplane was in trim for the landing approach when the go-around was commenced, it soon requires a great deal of forward  elevator/stabilator pressure as the airplane accelerates away in a climb. The pilot should apply appropriate forward pressure to  maintain the desired pitch attitude. Trim should be commenced immediately. The balked landing checklist should be reviewed as  work load permits.  

Flaps should be retracted before the landing gear for two reasons. First, on most airplanes, full flaps produce more drag than the  extended landing gear. Secondly, the airplane tends to settle somewhat with flap retraction, and the landing gear should be down in  the event of an inadvertent, momentary touchdown.  

Many multiengine airplanes have a landing gear retraction speed significantly less than the extension speed. Care should be exercised  during the go-around not to exceed the retraction speed. If the pilot desires to return for a landing, it is essential to re-accomplish the  entire before-landing   checklist. An   interruption   to   a pilot’s   habit patterns,   such   as a go-around, is a classic scenario for a subsequent  gear-up landing.  

The preceding discussion about performing a go-around assumes that the maneuver was initiated from normal approach speeds or  faster. If the go-around was initiated from a low airspeed, the initial pitch up to a climb attitude should be tempered with the necessity  to maintain adequate flying speed throughout the maneuver. Examples of where this applies include a go-around initiated from the  landing round out or recovery from a bad bounce, as well as a go-around initiated due to an inadvertent approach to a stall. The first  priority is always to maintain control and obtain adequate flying speed. A few moments of level or near level flight may be required  as the airplane accelerates up to climb speed.  

# Engine Inoperative Flight Principles  

There are two main considerations for OEI operations— performance and control . Multiengine pilots learn to operate the airplane for  maximum  rate of climb performance  at the blue radial indicated airspeed by training to fly without sideslip. Pilots also learn to  recognize and recover from loss of  directional control  associated with the red radial indicated airspeed by performing a   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration. Since the object of  a   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  demonstration is not performance, sideslip occurs during the maneuver. Detailed  discussion on both the loss of directional control and maximum OEI climb performance follows.  

# Derivation of  $\mathsf{v}_{\mathsf{M C}}$  

$\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is a speed established by the manufacturer, published in the AFM/POH, and marked on most airspeed indicators with a red  radial line. A knowledgeable and competent multiengine pilot understands that   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  is  not  a fixed airspeed under all conditions.   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is a fixed airspeed only for the very specific set of circumstances under which it was determined during aircraft certification. In  reality,   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    varies with a variety of factors as outlined below. The   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    noted in practice and demonstration, or in actual OEI  operation, could be less or even greater than the published value, depending on conditions and pilot technique.  

Historically, in aircraft certification,   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is the sea level calibrated airspeed at which, when the critical engine is suddenly made  inoperative, it is possible to maintain control of the airplane with that engine still inoperative and then maintain straight flight at the  same speed with an angle of bank not more than  $5^{\circ}$  .  

The foregoing refers to the determination of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    under  dynamic  conditions. This technique is only used by highly experienced test  pilots during aircraft certification. It is unsafe to be attempted outside of these circumstances.  

In aircraft certification, there is also a determination of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    under  static , or steady-state conditions. If there is a difference between  the dynamic and static speeds, the higher of the two is published as   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . The  static  determination is simply the ability to maintain  straight flight at   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  with a bank angle of not more than   $5^{\circ}$  . This more closely resembles the   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  demonstration task in the    practical test for a multiengine rating.  

The AFM/POH-published   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is determined with the  critical  engine inoperative. The critical engine is the engine whose failure had  the most adverse effect on directional control. On twins with each engine rotating in conventional, clockwise rotation as viewed from  the pilot's seat, the critical engine will be the left engine.  

Multiengine airplanes are subject to P-factor just as single-engine airplanes are. The descending propeller blade of each engine will  produce greater thrust than the ascending blade when the airplane is operated under power and at positive angles of attack. The  descending propeller blade of the right engine is also a greater distance from the center of gravity, and therefore has a longer moment  arm than the descending propeller blade of the left engine. As a result, failure of the left engine will result in the most asymmetrical  thrust (adverse yaw) as the right engine will be providing the remaining thrust.  [Figure 13-12]  

![](images/b785db55a5c84fcaa078101c58658b9affe470bf40a52275ee206a9630410827.jpg)  
Figure 13-12.  Forces created during single-engine operation.  

Many twins are designed with a counter-rotating right engine. With this design, the degree of asymmetrical thrust is the same  with either engine inoperative. No engine is more critical than the other, and a   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration may be performed with either  engine windmilling.  

The following bullets describe the way several factors affect   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    speed for those multiengine airplanes often used during training,  which were certified in accordance with historical 14 CFR part 23, section 23.149. They also describe the conditions used to  determine the manufacturer's published speed. Historically, in aircraft certification,  dynamic    $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    has been determined under the  following conditions outlined in historical 14 CFR part 23, section 23.149:  

⦁  Maximum  a vailable  t akeoff  p ower  initially on each engine (section 23.149(b)(1)) .   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   increases as  power is increased on the operating engine. With normally aspirated engines,  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   is highest at takeoff  power and sea level, and decreases with altitude. With turbocharged engines, takeoff power, and therefore   $\mathrm{V_{MC}},$  , remains constant with increases in altitude up to the engine's critical altitude (the altitude where the  engine can no longer maintain 100 percent power). Above the critical altitude,  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   decreases just as it  would with a normally aspirated engine whose critical altitude is sea level. In order to avoid accidents, test  pilots conduct   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   tests at a variety of altitudes, and the results of those tests are then extrapolated to a  single, sea level value.  

⦁  All propeller controls in the recommended takeoff position throughout  $\mathbf{V_{MC}}$    determination  

(section 23.149(b)(5)).    $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   increases with increased drag on the inoperative engine.  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is highest,  therefore, when the critical engine propeller is windmilling at the low pitch, high rpm blade angle.   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   is  normally determined with the critical engine propeller windmilling in the takeoff position, unless the  engine is equipped with an autofeather system.  

⦁  Most unfavorable weight and center-of-gravity position  (section 23.149(b)) .   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   increases as the  center-of-gravity  (CG) is moved aft.  The moment arm of the rudder is reduced, and therefore its effectivity   is reduced, as the CG is moved aft. For a typical light twin, the aft-most CG limit is the most unfavorable   CG position. Historically, 14 CFR part 23 calls for  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   to be determined at the most unfavorable weight.  For twins certificated under CAR 3 or early 14 CFR part 23, the weight at which   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   was determined was  not specified.  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   increases as weight is reduced. [ Figure 13-13 ]  

![](images/71a33fa9f00635e5d8f987546f6501a117423abf916032acfa61a99dab1b925a.jpg)  
Figure 13-13.  Effect of CG location on yaw.  

⦁  Landing gear retracted  (section 23.149(b)(4)).  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    increases when the landing gear is retracted.  Extended landing gear aids  directional stability, which tends to decrease   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  .  

⦁  F laps in the takeoff position  (section 23.149(b)(3)) .  This normally includes wing flaps and cowl flaps. For most twins, this will be  $0^{\circ}$   of flaps.  

⦁  Airplane trimmed for takeoff  (section 23.149(b)(2))  

⦁  Airplane airborne and the ground effect negligible  (section 23.149(b)) .  

⦁  Maximum of  $\pmb{5}^{\circ}$   angle of bank  (section 23.149(a)).    $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   is highly sensitive to bank angle. To prevent  claims of an unrealistically low   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   speed in aircraft certification, the manufacturer is permitted to use a   maximum of a  $5^{\circ}$   bank angle toward the operative engine. The horizontal component of lift generated by   the bank balances the side force from the rudder, rather than using sideslip to do so. Sideslip requires more   rudder deflection, which in turn increases   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . The bank angle works in the manufacturer's favor in  lowering   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   since using high bank angles reduces required rudder deflection. However, this method may   result in unsafe flight from both the large sideslip and the need to increase the angle of attack in order to   maintain the vertical component of lift.  

$\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    increases as bank angle decreases. In fact,   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    may increase more than 3 knots for each degree of bank reduction between   $5^{\circ}$    and wings-level .     Since  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    was determined with up to   $5^{\circ}$   of bank, loss of directional control may be experienced at speeds almost 20  knots above published  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   when the wings are held level.  

The  $5^{\circ}$   bank angle maximum is a historical limit imposed upon manufacturers in aircraft certification. The   $5^{\circ}$   bank does not inherently  establish zero sideslip or best single-engine climb performance. Zero sideslip, and therefore best single-engine climb  performance, may occur at bank angles less than   $5^{\circ}$  . The determination of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    in certification is solely concerned with the  minimum speed for directional control under a very specific set of circumstances, and not the optimum airplane attitude or  configuration for climb performance.  

During  dynamic   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    determination in aircraft certification, cuts of the critical engine using the mixture control are performed by  flight test pilots while gradually reducing the speed with each attempt.   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is the minimum speed at which directional control could  be maintained within  $20^{\circ}$    of the original entry heading when a cut of the critical engine was made. During such tests, the climb angle  with both engines operating was high, and the pitch attitude following the engine cut had to be quickly lowered to regain the initial  speed. Transitioning pilots should understand that attempting to demonstrate V  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  with an engine cut from high power, or  intentionally failing an engine at speeds less than  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$   creates a high likelihood for loss of control and an accident.  

#  $\mathtt{V_{M C}}$   Demo  

The actual demonstration of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    and recovery in flight training more closely resembles  static   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  determination in aircraft  certification. For a demonstration that avoids the hazard of unintended contact with the ground, the pilot selects an altitude that will  allow performance of the maneuver at least 3,000 feet AGL. The following description assumes a twin with non-counter-rotating  engines, where the left engine is critical.  

With the landing gear retracted and the flaps set to the takeoff position, the pilot slows the airplane to approximately 10 knots above   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$    or   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    (whichever is higher) and trims for takeoff. For the remainder of the maneuver, the trim setting remains unaltered.  The pilot selects an entry heading and sets high rpm on both propeller controls. Power on the left engine is throttled back to idle as  the right engine power is advanced to the takeoff setting. The landing gear warning horn will sound as long as a throttle is retarded,  however the pilot listens carefully for the stall warning horn or watches for the stall warning light. The left yawing and rolling  moment of the asymmetrical thrust is counteracted primarily with right rudder. A bank angle of up to   $5^{\circ}$   (a right bank in this case)  may be established as appropriate for the airplane make and model.  

While maintaining entry heading, the pitch attitude is slowly increased to decelerate at a rate of 1 knot per second (no faster). As the  airplane slows and control effectivity decays, the pilot counteracts the increasing yawing tendency with additional rudder pressure.  Aileron displacement will also increase in order to maintain the established bank. An airspeed is soon reached where full right rudder  travel and up to a  $5^{\circ}$   right bank can no longer counteract the asymmetrical thrust, and the airplane will begin to yaw uncontrollably to  the left.  

The moment the pilot first recognizes the uncontrollable yaw, or experiences any symptom associated with a stall, the pilot  simultaneously retards the throttle for the operating engine to stop the yaw and lowers the pitch attitude to regain speed. Recovery is  made to straight flight on the entry heading at   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$    or   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  . The pilot increases power to the operating engine, and demonstrates  controlled flight before restoring symmetrical power.  

To keep the foregoing description simple, there were several important background details that were not covered. The rudder pressure  during the demonstration can be quite high.  During certification under historical 14 CFR part 23, section 23.149(e), 150 pounds of  force was permitted. Most twins will run out of rudder travel long before 150 pounds of pressure is required. Still, the rudder  pressure used during any  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   demonstration may seem considerable.  

Maintaining altitude is not a criterion in accomplishing this maneuver. This is a demonstration of controllability, not  performance. Many airplanes will lose (or gain) altitude during the demonstration. Remaining at or above a minimum of  3,000 feet AGL throughout the maneuver is considered to be effective risk mitigation of certain hazards.  

#  ${\sf V}_{\sf M C}$    Demo Stall Avoidance  

As discussed earlier, with normally aspirated engines,   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    decreases with altitude. Stalling speed   $({\bf V}_{\mathrm{S}})$  , however, remains the same.  Except for a few models, published   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  is almost always higher than   $\mathrm{V}_{S}$  . At sea level there is usually a margin of several knots  between  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   and   $\mathrm{V}_{S}$  , but the margin decreases with altitude, and at some altitude,  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$   and   $\mathrm{V}_{S}$   are the same.  [Figure 13-14]  

Should a stall occur while the airplane is under asymmetrical power, a spin entry is likely. The yawing moment induced  from asymmetrical thrust is little different from that induced by full rudder in an intentional spin in the appropriate model of single- engine airplane. In this case, however, the airplane will depart controlled flight in the direction of the idle engine, not in the  direction of applied rudder. Twins are not required to demonstrate recoveries from spins, and their spin recovery characteristics are  generally very poor.  

Where   $\mathrm{V}_{S}$  is encountered before   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  , the departure from controlled flight might be quite sudden, with strong yawing and rolling  tendencies to the inverted orientation and a spin entry. Therefore, during a   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration, if there are any symptoms of an  impending stall such as a stall warning light or horn, airframe or elevator buffet, or sudden loss of control effectiveness; the  pilot should terminate the maneuver immediately by reducing the angle of attack as the throttle is retarded and return the airplane  to the entry airspeed. Note that noise within the flight deck may mask the sound of the stall warning horn.  

While the   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration shows the earliest onset of a loss of directional control when performed in accordance with the  foregoing procedures, avoid a stalled condition. Avoid stalls with asymmetrical thrust, such that the V  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  demonstration does not  degrade into a single-engine stall. A   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration that is allowed to degrade into a single-engine stall with high asymmetrical  thrust may result in an unrecoverable loss of control and a fatal accident.  

![](images/7965811d6719772259c47155eef148992b4f6f2d10432d38f1ff38cd9d0e3113.jpg)  
Figure 13-14.  Graph depicting relationship of   $V_{M C}$    to   $V_{S}.$  

An actual demonstration of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    may not be possible under certain conditions of density altitude, or with airplanes whose   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is  equal to or less than   ${\bf V}_{S}$  . Under those circumstances, as a training technique, a demonstration of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    may safely be conducted by  artificially limiting rudder travel to simulate maximum available rudder. A speed well above   $\mathrm{V}_{S}$    (approximately 20 knots) is  recommended when limiting rudder travel.  

The rudder limiting technique avoids the hazards of spinning as a result of stalling with high asymmetrical power, yet is effective in  demonstrating the loss of directional control.  

To reduce the risk of a loss of control, avoid performing any   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    demonstration from a high pitch attitude with both engines  operating and then reducing power on one engine.  

# OEI Climb Performance  

Best OEI climb performance is obtained at   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    with maximum available power and minimum drag. After the flaps and landing  gear have been retracted and the propeller of the failed engine feathered, a key element in best climb performance is minimizing  sideslip.  

For any airplane, sideslip can be confirmed through the use of a yaw string. A yaw string is a piece of string or yarn approximately 18  to 36 inches in length taped to the base of the windshield or to the nose near the windshield along the airplane centerline. In two- engine coordinated flight, the relative wind causes the string to align itself with the longitudinal axis of the airplane, and it positions  itself straight up the center of the windshield. This is zero sideslip. Experimentation with slips and skids vividly displays the location  of the relative wind. A particular combination of aileron and rudder also establishes zero sideslip during OEI flight. Adequate  altitude, flying speed, and caution should be maintained if attempting these maneuvers.  

With a single-engine airplane or a multiengine airplane with both engines operative, sideslip is eliminated when the ball of the turn  and bank instrument is centered. This is a condition of zero sideslip, and the airplane is presenting its smallest possible profile to the  relative wind. As a result, drag is at its minimum. Pilots know this as coordinated flight.  

In a multiengine airplane with an inoperative engine, the centered ball is no longer the indicator of zero sideslip due to asymmetric  thrust. In fact, there is no flight deck instrument that directly indicates conditions for zero sideslip. In the absence of a yaw string, the  pilot needs to place the airplane at a predetermined bank angle and ball position. Since the AFM/POH performance charts for one  engine inoperative flight were determined at zero sideslip, this technique should be used to obtain the charted OEI performance.  There are two different control inputs that can be used to counteract the asymmetric thrust of a failed engine:  

1. Yaw from the rudder  2. The horizontal component of lift that results from bank with the ailerons  

Used individually, neither is correct. Used together in the proper combination, zero sideslip and best climb performance are achieved.  

Three different scenarios of airplane control inputs are presented below. The first two are not correct and can increase the risk of a  loss of control. They are presented to illustrate the reasons for the zero sideslip approach to best climb performance.  

1. Engine inoperative flight with wings level and ball centered requires large rudder input toward the operative  engine.  [Figure 13-15]  The result is a moderate sideslip toward the inoperative engine. Climb performance is  reduced by the moderate sideslip. With wings level,  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    is significantly higher than published as there is no  horizontal component of lift available to help the rudder combat asymmetrical thrust.

Figure 13-15.  Wings level engine-out flight.  

2.  Engine inoperative flight using ailerons alone requires an    $_{8-10^{\circ}}$   bank   angle toward   the operative engine.   [Figure 13-16]  This assumes no rudder input, the ball is displaced well toward the operative engine, and climb  performance is greatly reduced by the large sideslip toward the operative engine. Due to the increased risk of  loss of control, instructors should not normally demonstrate this.

Figure 13-16.  Excessive bank engine-out flight.  

3. Rudder and ailerons used together in the proper combination result in a bank of approximately 2° toward the  operative engine. The ball is displaced approximately one-third to one-half toward the operative engine. The  result is zero sideslip and maximum climb performance.  [Figure 13-17]  Any attitude other than zero sideslip  increases drag, decreasing performance.  $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$    under these circumstances is higher than published, as less than  the  $5^{\circ}$   bank certification limit is employed.  

![](images/65856e900ee9ed8561ae924aefd5cae2257f9ca45c8739f891623f22c2904339.jpg)  
Figure 13-17.  Zero sideslip engine-out flight.  

When bank angle is plotted against climb performance for a hypothetical twin, zero sideslip results in the best (however marginal)  climb performance or the least rate of descent. Whether the airplane can climb depends on the weight of the airplane, density altitude,  and pilot technique. If the pilot uses zero bank (all rudder to counteract yaw), climb performance degrades as a result of moderate  sideslip. Using bank angle alone (no rudder) severely degrades climb performance as a result of a large sideslip.  

The precise condition of zero sideslip (bank angle and ball position) varies slightly from model to model and with available power  and airspeed. If the airplane is not equipped with counter-rotating propellers, it also varies slightly with the engine failed due to   $\mathrm{P}$  - factor. The foregoing zero sideslip recommendations apply to reciprocating engine multiengine airplanes flown at V  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  with the  inoperative engine feathered. The zero sideslip ball position for straight flight is also the zero sideslip position for turning flight.  

The actual bank angle for zero sideslip varies among airplanes from one and one-half to two and one-half degrees. The position of the  ball varies from one-third to one-half of a ball width from instrument center toward the operative engine.  

During certain flight training scenarios, pilots and instructors simulate propeller feathering.  Zero thrust  means the pilot sets power on  one engine such that drag from its rotating propeller equals that of a stopped feathered propeller. With an engine set to zero thrust (or  feathered) and the airplane slowed to   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  , a climb with maximum power on the remaining engine reveals the precise bank angle  and ball deflection required for zero sideslip and best climb performance. Again, if a yaw string were present, it aligns itself vertically  on the windshield as an indication of zero sideslip. There are very minor changes from this attitude depending upon the engine failed  (with non-counter-rotating propellers), power available, airspeed, and weight; but without more sensitive testing equipment, these  changes are difficult to detect. The only significant difference would be the pitch attitude required to maintain   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    under different  density altitude, power available, and weight conditions.  

# Low Altitude Engine Failure Scenarios  

In OEI flight at low altitudes and airspeeds such as the initial climb after takeoff, pilots should operate the airplane so as to guard  against the three major accident factors: (1) loss of directional control, (2) loss of performance, and (3) loss of flying speed. All have  equal potential to be lethal. Loss of flying speed is not a factor, however, when the airplane is operated with due regard for directional  control and performance.  

A takeoff or go-around is the most critical time to suffer an engine failure. The airplane will be slow, close to the ground, and may  even have landing gear and flaps extended. Altitude and time is minimal. Until feathered, the propeller of the failed engine is  windmilling, producing a great deal of drag and yawing tendency. Airplane climb performance is marginal or even non-existent, and  obstructions may lie ahead. An emergency contingency plan and safety brief should be clearly understood well before the takeoff roll  commences. An engine failure before a predetermined airspeed or point results in an aborted takeoff. An engine failure after a certain  airspeed and point, with the gear up, and climb performance assured result in a continued takeoff. With loss of an engine, it is  paramount to   maintain   airplane control and   comply   with   the manufacturer’s   recommended   emergency   procedures. Complete failure  of one engine shortly after takeoff can be broadly categorized into one of three following scenarios.  

# Landing Gear Down  

If the engine failure occurs prior to selecting the landing gear to the UP position  [Figure 13-18] : Keep the nose as straight as  possible, close both throttles, adjust pitch attitude to maintain adequate airspeed, and descend to the runway. Concentrate on a normal  landing and do not force the aircraft on the ground. Land on the remaining runway or overrun. Depending upon how quickly the pilot  reacts to the sudden yaw, the airplane may run off the side of the runway by the time action is taken. There are really no other  practical options. As discussed earlier, the chances of maintaining directional control while retracting the flaps (if extended), landing  gear, feathering the propeller, and accelerating are minimal. On some airplanes with a single-engine-driven hydraulic pump, failure of  that engine means the only way to raise the landing gear is to allow the engine to windmill or to use a hand pump. This is not a viable  alternative during takeoff.  

![](images/c1414e75118128459b576a11d66263d11459ffc5696c18a8a7b1a3fb49957edb.jpg)  
Figure 13-18.  Engine failure on takeoff, landing gear down.  

# Landing Gear Control Selected Up, Single-Engine Climb Performance Inadequate  

When operating near or above the single-engine ceiling and an engine failure is experienced shortly after lift-off, a landing needs to  be accomplished on whatever essentially lies ahead.  [Figure 13-19]  There is also the option of continuing ahead, in a descent at   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    with the remaining engine producing power, as long as the pilot is not tempted to remain airborne beyond the airplane’s  performance capability. Remaining airborne and bleeding off airspeed in a futile attempt to maintain altitude is almost invariably  fatal. Landing under control is paramount. The greatest hazard in a single-engine takeoff is attempting to fly when it is not within the  performance capability of the airplane to do so. An accident is inevitable.  

![](images/542fed56989bdb6325ab5aed3e205cb22736b6943d370ea7c37b425582cd87e7.jpg)  
Figure 13-19.  Engine failure on takeoff, inadequate climb performance.  

Analysis of engine failures on takeoff reveals a very high success rate of off-airport engine inoperative landings when the airplane is  landed under control. Analysis also reveals a very high fatality rate in stall spin accidents when the pilot attempts flight beyond the  performance capability of the airplane.  

As   mentioned   previously,    the airplane’s   landing   gear   retraction   mechanism    dependent upon   hydraulic pressure from   a certain  engine-driven pump, failure of that engine can mean a loss of hundreds of feet of altitude as the pilot either windmills the engine to  provide hydraulic pressure to raise the gear or raises it manually with a backup pump.  

# Landing Gear Control Selected Up, Single-Engine Climb Performance Adequate  

If the single-engine rate of climb is adequate, the procedures for continued flight should be followed.  [Figure 13-20]  There are four  areas of concern: control, configuration, climb, and checklist.  

![](images/c32a82b66a61fa4f5814a5f3213432b6188f957ba085551d216978ba6d08cb1a.jpg)  
Figure 13-20.  Landing gear up—adequate climb performance.  

# Control  

The first consideration following engine failure during takeoff is to maintain control of the airplane. Maintaining directional control  with prompt and often aggressive rudder application and STOPPING THE YAW is critical to the safety of flight. Ensure that  airspeed stays above   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . If the yaw cannot be controlled with full rudder applied, reducing thrust on the operative engine is the  only alternative. Attempting to correct the roll with aileron without first applying rudder increases drag and adverse yaw and further  degrades directional control. After rudder is applied to stop the yaw, a slight amount of aileron should be used to bank the airplane  toward the operative engine. This is the most efficient way to control the aircraft, minimize drag, and gain the most  performance. Control forces, particularly on the rudder, may be high. The pitch attitude for   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    has to be lowered from that of   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  .  At least   $5^{\circ}$    and a maximum of   $10^{\circ}$    of bank toward the operative engine should be used initially to stop the yaw and maintain  directional control. This initial bank input is held only momentarily, just long enough to establish or ensure directional control.  Climb performance suffers when bank angles exceed approximately 2 or   $3^{\circ}$  , but obtaining and maintaining   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    and directional  control are paramount. Trim should be adjusted to lower the control forces.  

# Configuration  

The memory items from the engine failure after takeoff checklist should be promptly executed to configure the airplane for climb.  [Figure 13-21]  The specific procedures to follow are found in the AFM/POH and checklist for the particular airplane. Most direct the  pilot to assume   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  , set takeoff power, retract the flaps and landing gear, identify, verify, and feather the failed engine. (On some  airplanes, the landing gear is to be retracted before the flaps.)  

The “identify” step   is   for   the pilot to   initially   identify   the failed   engine.   Confirmation   on   the engine gauges may   or   may   not be  possible, depending upon the failure mode. Identification should be primarily through the control inputs required to maintain straight  flight, not the engine gauges. The “verify” step   directs   the pilot to   retard   the throttle of   the engine thought to   have failed. No change  in performance when the suspected throttle is retarded is verification that the correct engine has been identified as failed. The  corresponding propeller control should be brought fully aft to feather the engine.  

# Climb  

As soon as directional control is established and the airplane configured for climb, the bank angle should be reduced to that  producing best climb performance. Without specific guidance for zero sideslip, a bank of   $2^{\circ}$   and one-third to one-half ball deflection  on the slip/skid indicator toward the operative engine is suggested.   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    is maintained with pitch control. As turning flight reduces  climb performance, climb should be made straight ahead or with shallow turns to avoid obstacles to an altitude of at least 400 feet  AGL before attempting a return to the airport.  

# Checklist  

Having accomplished the memory items from the engine failure after takeoff checklist, the printed copy should be reviewed as time  permits. The securing failed engine checklist should then be accomplished.  [Figure 13-22]  Unless the pilot suspects an engine fire,  the remaining items should be accomplished deliberately and without undue haste. Airplane control should never be sacrificed to  execute the remaining checklists. The priority items have already been accomplished from memory.  

Other than closing the cowl flap of the failed engine, none of these items, if left undone, adversely affect airplane climb performance.  There is a distinct possibility of actuating an incorrect switch or control if the procedure is rushed. The pilot should concentrate on  flying the airplane and extracting maximum performance. If an ATC facility is available, an emergency should be declared.  

The memory   items   in   the engine failure after   takeoff   checklist may   be redundant with   the airplane’s   existing   configuration.   For  example, in the third takeoff scenario, the gear and flaps were assumed to already be retracted, yet the memory items included gear  and flaps. This is not an oversight. The purpose of the memory items is to either initiate the appropriate action or to confirm that a  condition exists. Action on each item may not be required in all cases. The memory items also apply to more than one circumstance.  In an engine failure from a go-around, for example, the landing gear and flaps would likely be extended when the failure occurred.  

The three preceding takeoff scenarios all include the landing gear as a key element in the decision to land or continue. With the  landing gear selector in the DOWN position, for example, continued takeoff and climb is not recommended. This situation, however,  is not justification to retract the landing gear the moment the airplane lifts off the surface on takeoff as a normal procedure. The  landing gear should remain selected down as long as there is usable runway or overrun available to land on. The use of wing flaps for  takeoff virtually eliminates the likelihood of a single-engine climb until the flaps are retracted.  

There are two time-tested memory aids the pilot may find useful in dealing with engine-out scenarios.   The first, “dead   foot—dead  engine”    used   to   assist in   identifying   the failed   engine.   Depending   on   the failure mode,   the pilot will not be able to   consistently  identify the failed engine in a timely manner from the engine gauges. In maintaining directional control, however, rudder pressure is  exerted   on   the side (left or   right)   of   the airplane with   the operating   engine.   Thus,   the “dead   foot” is   on   the same side as the “dead   engine.” Variations   on   this   saying   include “idle foot—idle engine”   and   “working   foot–working   engine.”  

The second   memory   aid   has to   do   with   climb   performance.   The phrase “raise the dead” is   a reminder   that the best climb   performance  is   obtained   with   a very   shallow   bank,   about   $2^{\circ}$   toward   the operating   engine.   Therefore,   the inoperative,   or   “dead” engine should be  “raised” with   a very   slight bank.  

Not all engine failures result in complete power loss. If there is a performance loss when the throttle of the affected engine is retarded,  some power is still available. In this case, the pilot may consider allowing the engine to run until the airplane reaches a safe altitude  and airspeed for single-engine flight. While shutdown of a malfunctioning engine may prevent additional damage to the engine in  certain circumstances, shutting down an engine that can still produce partial  power may increase risk for an accident.  

# Engine Failure During Flight  

Engine failures well above the ground are handled differently than those occurring at lower speeds and altitudes. Cruise airspeed  allows better airplane control and altitude, which may permit time for a possible diagnosis and remedy of the failure.  Maintaining airplane control, however, is still paramount. Airplanes have been lost at altitude due to apparent fixation on the  engine problem to the detriment of flying the airplane.  

Not all engine failures or malfunctions are catastrophic in nature (catastrophic meaning a major mechanical failure that damages the  engine and precludes further engine operation). Many cases of power loss are related to fuel starvation, where restoration of power may be made with the selection of another tank. An orderly inventory of gauges and switches may reveal the problem.  Carburetor heat or alternate air can be selected. The affected engine may run smoothly on just one magneto or at a lower power  setting. Altering the mixture may help. If fuel vapor formation is suspected, fuel boost pump operation may be used to eliminate  flow and pressure fluctuations.  

Although it is a natural desire among pilots to save an ailing engine with a precautionary shutdown, the engine should be left running  if there is any doubt as to needing it for further safe flight. Catastrophic failure accompanied by heavy vibration, smoke,  blistering paint, or large trails of oil, on the other hand, indicate a critical situation. The affected engine should be feathered and  the securing failed engine checklist completed. The pilot should divert to the nearest suitable airport and declare an emergency  with ATC for priority handling.  

Fuel crossfeed is a method of getting fuel from a tank on one side of the airplane to an operating engine on the other. Crossfeed is  used for extended single-engine operation. If a suitable airport is close at hand, there is no need to consider crossfeed. If prolonged  flight on a single-engine is inevitable due to airport non-availability, then crossfeed allows use of fuel that would otherwise  be unavailable to the operating engine. It also permits the pilot to balance the fuel consumption to avoid an out-of-balance  wing heaviness.  

The AFM/POH procedures for crossfeed vary widely. Thorough fuel system knowledge is essential if crossfeed is to be conducted.  Fuel selector positions and fuel boost pump usage for crossfeed differ greatly among multiengine airplanes. Prior to landing, crossfeed should be terminated and the operating engine returned to its main tank fuel supply.  

If the airplane is above its single-engine absolute ceiling at the time of engine failure, it slowly loses altitude. The pilot  should maintain   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  to minimize the rate of altitude loss. This “drift down” rate is greatest immediately following the  failure and   decreases as the single-engine ceiling is approached. Due to performance variations caused by engine and propeller wear,  turbulence, and pilot technique, the airplane may not maintain altitude even at its published single-engine ceiling. Any further  rate of sink, however, would likely be modest.  

An engine failure in a descent or other low power setting can be deceiving. The dramatic yaw and performance loss is absent. At very  low power settings, the pilot may not even be aware of a failure. If a failure is suspected, the pilot should advance both  engine mixtures, propellers, and throttles significantly, to the takeoff settings if necessary, to correctly identify the failed engine. The  power on the operative engi ne can alw ays be reduced later.  

# Engine Inoperative Approach and Landing  

The approach and landing with OEI is essentially the same as a two-engine approach and landing. The traffic pattern should be flown  at similar altitudes, airspeeds, and key positions as a two-engine approach. The differences are the reduced power available and the  fact that the remaining thrust is asymmetrical. A higher-than-normal power setting is necessary on the operative engine.  

With adequate airspeed and performance, the landing gear can still be extended on the downwind leg. In which case it should  be confirmed DOWN no later than abeam the intended point of landing. Performance permitting, initial extension of wing  flaps (typically   $10^{\circ}$  ) and a descent from pattern altitude can also be initiated on the downwind leg. The airspeed should be no slower  than  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$  . The direction of the traffic pattern, and therefore the turns, is of no consequence as far as airplane controllability  and performance are concerned. It is perfectly acceptable to make turns toward the failed engine.  

On the base leg, if performance is adequate, the flaps may be extended to an intermediate setting (typically   $25^{\circ}$  ). If the performance is  inadequate, as measured by decay in airspeed or high sink rate, delay further flap extension until closer to the runway.   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    is still the  minimum airspeed to maintain.  

On final approach, a normal   $3^{\circ}$   glidepath to a landing is desirable. Visual approach slope indicator (VASI) or other vertical path  lighting aids should be utilized if available. Slightly steeper approaches may be acceptable. However, a long, flat, low approach  should be avoided. Large, sudden power applications or reductions should also be avoided. Maintain   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    until the landing is  assured, then slow to   $1.3\,\mathrm{\:V_{SO}}$    or the AFM/POH recommended speed. The final flap setting may be delayed until the landing is  assured or the airplane may be landed with partial flaps.  

The airplane should remain in trim throughout. The pilot should be prepared, however, for a rudder trim change as the power of the  operating engine is reduced to idle in the round out just prior to touchdown. With drag from only one windmilling propeller, the  airplane tends to float more than on a two-engine approach. Precise airspeed control therefore is essential, especially when landing on  a short, wet, and/or slippery surface.  

Some pilots favor resetting the rudder trim to neutral on final and compensating for yaw by holding rudder pressure for the remainder  of the approach. This eliminates the rudder trim change close to the ground as the throttle is closed during the round out for landing.  This technique eliminates the need for groping for the rudder trim and manipulating it to neutral during final approach, which many  pilots find to be highly distracting. AFM/POH recommendations or personal preference should be used.  

A single-engine go-around on final approach may not be possible. As a practical matter in single-engine approaches, once the airplane  is on final approach with landing gear and flaps extended, it is committed to land on the intended runway, on another runway,  a taxiway, or grassy infield. Most light-twins do not have the performance to climb on one engine with landing gear and flaps  extended. Considerable altitude is lost while maintaining   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$    and retracting landing gear and flaps. Losses of 500 feet or  more are not unusual. If the landing gear has been lowered with an alternate means of extension, retraction may not be possible,  virtually negating any climb capability.  

# Multiengine Training Considerations  

Flight training in a multiengine airplane can be safely accomplished if both the instructor and the learner consider the following  factors.  

⦁  The participants should conduct a preflight briefing of the objectives, maneuvers, expected learner actions,  and completion standards before the flight begins.  

⦁  A clear understanding exists as to how simulated emergencies will be introduced, and what action the  learner is expected to take.  

The introduction, practice, and testing of emergency procedures has always been a sensitive subject. Surprising a multiengine learner  with an emergency without a thorough briefing beforehand creates a hazardous condition. Simulated engine failures, for example,  can very quickly become actual emergencies or lead to loss of the airplane when approached carelessly. Stall-spin accidents in  training for emergencies rival the number of stall-spin accidents from actual emergencies. The training risk normally gets mitigated by  a briefing. Pulling circuit breakers is not recommended for training purposes and can lead to a subsequent gear up landing.  

Many normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures can be introduced and practiced in the airplane as it sits on the ground without  the engines running. In this respect, the airplane is used as a procedures trainer. The value of this training may be substantial. The  engines do not have to be operating for real learning to occur. Upon completion of a training session, care should be taken to restore  items to their proper positions.  

Pilots who do not use a checklist effectively will be at a significant disadvantage in multiengine airplanes. Use of the checklist is  essential to safe operation of airplanes, and it is risky to conduct a flight without one. The manufacturer's checklist or an aftermarket  checklist that conforms to the manufacturer's procedures for the specific make, model, and model year may be used. If there is a  procedural discrepancy between the checklist and the AFM/POH, then the AFM/POH always takes precedence.  

Certain immediate action items (such as a response to an engine failure in a critical phase of flight) are best committed to memory.  After they are accomplished, and as work load permits, the pilot can compare the action taken with a checklist.  

Simulated engine failures during the takeoff ground roll may be accomplished with the mixture control. The simulated failure should  be introduced at a speed no greater than 50 percent of   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  . If a learner does not react promptly by retarding both throttles, the  instructor can always pull the other mixture.  

The FAA recommends that all in-flight simulated engine failures below 3,000 feet AGL, be introduced with a smooth reduction of the  throttle. Thus, the engine is kept running and is available for instant use, if necessary. Smooth throttle reduction avoids abusing the  engine and possibly causing damage. Simulation of inflight engine failures below   $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$    introduces a very high and unnecessary  training risk.  

If the engines are equipped with dynamic crankshaft counterweights, it is essential to make throttle reductions for simulated failures  smoothly. Other areas leading to dynamic counterweight damage include high rpm and low manifold pressure combinations, over- boosting, and propeller feathering. Severe damage or repetitive abuse to counterweights will eventually lead to engine failure.  Dynamic counterweights are found on larger, more complex engines—instructors may check with maintenance personnel or the  engine manufacturer to determine if their airplane engines are so equipped.  

When an instructor simulates an engine failure, the learner should respond with the appropriate memory items and retard the  appropriate propeller control toward the FEATHER position. Assuming zero thrust will be set, the instructor promptly moves the  propeller control forward and sets the appropriate manifold pressure and rpm. It is vital that the learner be kept informed of the  instructor's intentions. At this point the instructor may say words to the effect, "I have the right engine; you have the left. I have set  zero thrust and the right engine is simulated feathered." Any ambiguity as to who is operating what systems or controls increases the  likelihood of an unintended outcome.  

Following a simulated engine failure, the instructor cares for the "failed" engine just as the learner cares for the operative engine. If  zero thrust is set to simulate a feathered propeller, the cowl flap is normally closed and the mixture leaned. An occasional clearing of  the engine is also desirable. If possible, avoid high power applications immediately following a prolonged cool-down at a zero-thrust  power setting. A competent flight instructor teaches the multiengine learner about the critical importance of feathering the propeller in  a timely manner should an actual engine failure situation ever be encountered. A windmilling propeller, in many cases, has given the  improperly trained multiengine pilot the mistaken perception that the engine is still developing useful thrust, resulting in a  psychological reluctance to feather, as feathering results in cessation of propeller rotation. The flight instructor should spend ample  time demonstrating the difference in the performance capabilities of the airplane with a simulated feathered propeller (zero thrust) as  opposed to a windmilling propeller.  

Actual and safe propeller feathering for training is performed at altitudes and positions where safe landings on established airports  may be readily accomplished if the propeller will not unfeather. Plan unfeathering and restart to be completed no lower than 3,000  feet AGL. At certain elevations and with many popular multiengine training airplanes, this may be above the single-engine service  ceiling, and level flight will not be possible.  

Repeated feathering and unfeathering is hard on the engine and airframe, and is done as necessary to ensure adequate training. The  FAA's Airman Certification Standards for a multiengine class rating contains a task for feathering and unfeathering of one propeller  during flight in airplanes in which it is safe to do so.  

While much of this chapter has been devoted to the unique flight characteristics of a multiengine airplane with one engine  inoperative, the modern well-maintained reciprocating engine is remarkably reliable. When training in an airplane, initiation of a  simulated engine inoperative emergency at low altitude normally occurs at a minimum of 400 feet AGL to mitigate the risk involved  and only after the learner has successfully mastered engine inoperative procedures at higher altitudes. Initiating a simulated  low altitude engine inoperative emergency in the airplane at extremely low altitude, immediately after liftoff, or below V  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{SSE}}$  creates a situation where there are non-existent safety margins.  

For training in maneuvers that would be hazardous in flight, or for initial and recurrent qualification in an advanced multiengine  airplane, consider a simulator training center or manufacturer's training course. Comprehensive training manuals and classroom  instruction are available along with system training aids, audio/visuals, and flight training devices and simulators. Training under a  wide variety of environmental and aircraft conditions is available through simulation. Emergency procedures that would be either  dangerous or impossible to accomplish in an airplane can be done safely and effectively in a flight training device or simulator. The  flight training device or simulator need not necessarily duplicate the specific make and model of airplane to be useful. Highly  effective instruction can be obtained in training devices for other makes and models as well as generic training devices.  

The majority of multiengine training is conducted in four-to-six place airplanes at weights significantly less than maximum. Single- engine performance, particularly, at low density altitudes, may be deceptively good. To experience the performance expected at  higher weights, altitudes and temperatures, the instructor may occasionally artificially limit the amount of manifold pressure available  on the operative engine. Airport operations above the single-engine ceiling can also be simulated in this matter. Avoid loading the  airplane with passengers to practice emergencies at maximum takeoff weight since this practice creates an unnecessary training  hazard.  

The use of the touch-and-go landing and takeoff in multiengine flight training has always been somewhat controversial. The value of  the learning experience may be offset by the hazards of reconfiguring the airplane for takeoff in extremely limited time as well as the  loss of the follow-through ordinarily experienced in a full stop landing. Touch-and-goes are not recommended during initial aircraft  familiarization in multiengine airplanes.  

If touch-and-goes are to be performed at all, the learner and instructor responsibilities should be carefully briefed prior to each flight.   Following touchdown, the learner will ordinarily maintain directional control while keeping the left hand on the yoke and the right   hand on the throttles. The instructor resets the flaps and trim and announces when the airplane has been reconfigured. The  multiengine airplane uses considerably more runway to perform a touch-and-go than a single-engine airplane. A full stop-taxi back  landing is preferable during initial familiarization. Solo touch-and-goes in twins are strongly discouraged.  

# Chapter Summary  

Small multiengine airplanes handle much like single-engine airplanes as long as both engines are functioning normally. A competent  multiengine pilot, however, acquires the additional knowledge, risk mitigation strategies, and practical skills required to fly a  multiengine airplane in case a loss of thrust from one engine actually occurs. In that case, the pilot will be able to take appropriate  action leading to a safe outcome. Much of this chapter discussed loss of directional control. How to obtain the best performance with  an inoperative engine was also described in detail. These two considerations correspond to the red radial line   $\left({{\bf{V}}_{\mathrm{{MC}}}}\right)$   and the blue  radial line   $(\mathrm{V_{YSE}})$   on the airspeed indicator. The actions a pilot takes when dealing with stalls,   $\mathrm{V_{MC}}$  , or best performance vary  greatly. Understanding these concepts, knowing how to mitigate the risks, and possessing the skills to handle an engine failure in a  variety of situations, allows a pilot to enjoy the increased performance and safety provided when flying a multiengine airplane.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 14: Transition to Tailwheel Airplanes  

# Introduction  

Due to their design and structure, tailwheel airplanes (tailwheels) exhibit operational and handling characteristics different from those  of tricycle-gear airplanes (nose-wheels).  [Figure 14-1]  A few aircraft, primarily antique and experimental, may have a tailskid instead  of a tailwheel. The same principles discussed in this chapter usually apply to tailskid. In general, tailwheels are less forgiving of pilot  error while in contact with the ground than are nose-wheels. This chapter focuses on the operational differences that occur during  ground operations, takeoffs, and landings.  

![](images/c3bc623e742414fd9f619d0d8ff9a7f3590fd340dd5e6b4857f8943c83b1ebcb.jpg)  
Figure 14-1.  The Piper Super Cub on the left is a popular tailwheel airplane. The airplane on the right is a Mooney M20, which is a  nose-wheel (tricycle gear) airplane.  

Although   still   termed   “conventional-gear   airplanes,”   tailwheel designs   are most likely   to   be encountered   today   by   pilots   who   have  first learned in nose-wheels. Therefore, tailwheel operations are approached as they appear to a pilot making a transition from nose- wheel designs.  

# Landing Gear  

The main landing gear forms the principal support of the airplane on the ground. The tailwheel also supports the airplane, but steering  and directional control are its primary functions. With the tailwheel-type airplane, the two main landing gear struts are attached to the  airplane slightly   ahead   of   the airplane’s   center   of   gravity   (CG),   so   that the plane naturally   rests    a nose-high attitude on the triangle  created by the main gear and the tailwheel. This arrangement is responsible for the three major handling differences between nose- wheel and tailwheel airplanes. They center on directional instability, angle of attack (AOA), and crosswind weathervaning tendencies.  

Proper usage of the rudder pedals is crucial for directional control while taxiing. Steering with the pedals may be accomplished  through the forces of airflow or propeller slipstream acting on the rudder surface or through a direct mechanical linkage or a  mechanical linkage acting through springs to turn the tailwheel. Initially, the pilot should taxi with the heels of the feet resting on the  floor and the balls of the feet on the bottom of the rudder pedals. The feet should be slid up onto the brake pedals only when it is  necessary to depress the brakes. This permits the simultaneous application of rudder and brake whenever needed. Some models of  tailwheel airplanes are equipped with heel brakes rather than toe brakes. As in nose-wheel airplanes, brakes are used to slow and stop  the aircraft and to increase turning authority when tailwheel steering inputs prove insufficient. Whenever used, brakes should be  applied smoothly and evenly.  

# Instability  

Because of the relative placement of the main gear and the CG, tailwheel aircraft are inherently unstable on the ground. As taxi turns  are started, the aircraft begins to pivot on one or the other of the main wheels. From that point, with the CG aft of that pivot point, the  forward momentum of the plane acts to continue and even tighten the turn without further steering inputs. Ordinarily, removal of  rudder pressure does not stop a turn that has been started, and it is necessary to apply an opposite input (opposite rudder) to bring the  aircraft back to straight-line travel. For this reason, many tailwheel airplanes are equipped with a centering spring(s) or similar device  that returns the tailwheel to a center position upon relaxation of a rudder pedal input. However, this mechanism may not return the  airplane to a straight line of travel from a tight turn.  

If the initial rudder input is maintained after a turn has been started, the turn continues to tighten, an unexpected result for pilots  accustomed to a nose-wheel. In consequence, it is common for pilots making the transition between the two types to experience  difficulty in early taxi attempts. As long as taxi speeds are kept low, however, no serious problems result, and pilots typically adjust  quickly to the technique of using rudder pressure to start a turn, then neutralizing the pedals as the turn continues, and finally using an  opposite pedal input to stop the turn and regain straight-line travel.  

Because of this inbuilt instability, the most important lesson that can be taught in tailwheel airplanes is to taxi and make turns at slow  speeds.  

# Angle of Attack  

A second strong contrast to nose-wheel airplanes, tailwheel aircraft make lift while on the ground anytime there is a relative  headwind. The amount of lift obviously depends on the wind speed, but even at slow taxi speeds, the wings and ailerons are doing  their best to aid in liftoff. This phenomenon requires care and management, especially during the takeoff and landing rolls, and is  again unexpected by nose-wheel pilots making the transition.  

# Taxiing  

On most tailwheel-type airplanes, directional control while taxiing is facilitated by the use of a steerable tailwheel, which operates  along with the rudder. The tailwheel steering mechanism remains engaged when the tailwheel is operated through an arc of about   $30^{\circ}$    each side of center. Beyond that limit, the tailwheel breaks free and becomes full swiveling. In full swivel mode, the airplane can be  pivoted within its own length, if desired. While taxiing, the steerable tailwheel should be used for making normal turns and the pilot’s   feet kept off the brake pedals to avoid unnecessary wear on the brakes.  

When beginning to taxi, the brakes should be tested immediately for proper operation. This is done by first applying power to start  the airplane moving slowly forward, then retarding the throttle and simultaneously applying pressure smoothly to both brakes. If  braking action is unsatisfactory, the engine should be shut down immediately.  

To turn the airplane on the ground, the pilot should apply rudder in the desired direction of turn and use whatever power or brake  necessary to control the taxi speed. At very low taxi speeds, directional response is sluggish as surface friction acting on the tailwheel  inhibits inputs through the steering springs. At normal taxi speeds, rudder inputs alone should be sufficient to start and stop most  turns. During taxi, the AOA built in to the structure gives control placement added importance when compared to nose-wheel models.  

When taxiing in a quartering headwind, the upwind wing can easily be lifted by gusting or strong winds unless ailerons are positioned  to   “kill” lift on   that side (stick   held   into   the wind).   This    standard   control positioning   for   both   nose-wheel and tailwheel airplanes, so  the difference lies only in the added tailwheel vulnerability created by the fuselage pitch attitude. At the same time, elevator should  usually be held full back to add downward pressure to the tailwheel assembly and improve tailwheel steering response. However, in a  strong quartering headwind a wing could lift, and the elevator may be held closer to neutral.  

When taxiing with a quartering tailwind, this fuselage angle reduces the tendency of the wind to lift either wing. Nevertheless, the  basic vulnerability to surface winds common to all tailwheel airplanes makes it essential to be aware of wind direction at all times, so  holding the stick away from the crosswind is good practice (left aileron in a right quartering tailwind).  

Elevator positioning in tailwinds is a bit more complex. Standard teaching tends to recommend full forward stick in any degree of  tailwind, arguing that a tailwind striking the elevator when it is deflected full down increases downward pressure on the tailwheel  assembly and increases directional control. Equally important, if the elevator were to remain deflected up, a strong tailwind can get  under the control  surface and lift the tail with unfortunate consequences for the propeller and engine.  

While stick-forward positioning is essential in strong tailwinds, it is not likely to be an appropriate response when winds are light.  The propeller wash in even lightly-powered airplanes is usually strong enough to overcome the effects of light tailwinds, producing a  net headwind over the tail. This in turn suggests that back stick, not forward, does the most to help with directional control. If in  doubt, it is best to sample the wind as you taxi and position the elevator where it will do the most good.  

# Weathervaning  

Tailwheel airplanes have an exaggerated tendency to weathervane, or turn into the wind, when operated on the ground in crosswinds.  This tendency is greatest when taxiing with a direct crosswind, a factor that makes maintaining directional control more difficult,  sometimes requiring use of the brakes when tailwheel steering alone proves inadequate to counteract the weathervane effect.  

# Visibility  

In the normal nose-high   attitude,   the engine cowling   may   be high   enough   to   restrict the pilot’s   vision   of   the area   directly   ahead   of   the  airplane while on the ground. Consequently, objects directly ahead are difficult, if not impossible to see. In aircraft that are  completely blind ahead, all taxi movements should be started with a small turn to ensure no other plane or ground vehicle has  positioned   itself   directly   under   the nose while the pilot’s   attention   was distracted   with   getting   ready   to   takeoff.   In   taxiing such an  airplane, the pilot should alternately turn the nose from one side to the other (zigzag) or make a series of short S-turns. This should be  done slowly, smoothly, positively, and cautiously.  

# Directional Control  

After absorbing all the information presented to this point, the transitioning pilot may conclude that the best approach to maintaining  directional control is to limit rudder inputs from fear of overcontrolling. Although intuitive, this is an incorrect assumption: the  disadvantages built in to the tailwheel design sometimes require vigorous rudder inputs to maintain or retain directional control. The  best approach is to understand the fact that tailwheel aircraft are not damaged from the use of too much rudder, but rather from rudder  inputs held for too long.  

# Normal Takeoff Roll  

Wing flaps should be lowered prior to takeoff if recommended by the manufacturer. After taxiing onto the runway, the airplane  should be aligned with the intended takeoff direction, and the tailwheel positioned straight or centered. In airplanes equipped with a  locking device, the tailwheel should be locked in the centered position. After releasing the brakes, the throttle should be smoothly and  continuously advanced to takeoff power. The pilot should carefully avoid applying brake pressure during the takeoff roll.  

After a brief period of acceleration, positive forward elevator should be applied to smoothly lift the tail. The goal is to achieve a pitch  attitude that improves forward visibility and produces a smooth transition to climbing flight as the aircraft continues to accelerate.  

It is important to note that nose-down pitch movement produces left yaw, the result of gyroscopic precession created by the propeller.  The amount of force created by this precession is directly related to the rate the propeller axis is tilted when the tail is raised, so it is  best to avoid an abrupt pitch change. Whether smooth or abrupt, the need to react to this yaw with rudder inputs emphasizes the  increased directional demands common to tailwheel airplanes, a demand likely to be unanticipated by pilots transitioning from nose- wheel models.  

As speed is gained on the runway, the added authority of the elevator naturally continues to pitch the nose forward. During this stage,  the pilot should concentrate on maintaining a constant-pitch attitude by gradually reducing elevator deflection. At the same time,  directional control should be maintained with smooth, prompt, positive rudder corrections. All this activity emphasizes the point that  tailwheel planes start to   “fly” long   before leaving   the runway   surface.  

# Liftoff  

When the appropriate pitch attitude is maintained throughout the takeoff roll, liftoff occurs when the AOA and airspeed combine to  produce   the necessary   lift without any   additional “rotation” input. The ideal takeoff   attitude requires only   minimum   pitch   adjustments  shortly after the airplane lifts off to attain the desired climb speed.  

All modern tailwheel aircraft can be lifted off in the three-point attitude. That is, the AOA with all three wheels on the ground does  not exceed the critical AOA, and the wings will not be stalled. While instructive, this technique results in an unusually high pitch  attitude and an AOA excessively close to stall, both inadvisable circumstances when flying only inches from the ground.  

As the airplane leaves the ground, the pilot should continue to maintain straight flight and hold the proper pitch attitude. During  takeoffs in strong, gusty winds, it is advisable to add an extra margin of speed before the airplane is allowed to leave the ground. A  takeoff at the normal takeoff speed may result in a lack of positive control, or a stall, when the airplane encounters a sudden lull in  strong, gusty wind or other turbulent air currents. In this case, the pilot should hold the airplane on the ground longer to attain more  speed, then make a smooth, positive rotation to leave the ground.  

# Crosswind Takeoff  

It is important to establish and maintain proper crosswind corrections prior to liftoff; that is, application of aileron deflection into the  wind to keep the upwind wing from rising and rudder deflection as needed to prevent weathervaning.  

Takeoffs made into strong crosswinds are the reason for maintaining a positive AOA (tail-low attitude) while accelerating on the  runway. Because the wings are making lift during the takeoff roll, a strong upwind aileron deflection can bank the airplane into the  wind and provide positive crosswind correction soon after the takeoff roll begins. The remainder of the takeoff roll is then made on  the upwind main wheel while the pilot uses rudder to maintain the alignment of the longitudinal axis with the runway. As the airplane  accelerates, the pilot smoothly decreases the pitch attitude and adjusts aileron and rudder control pressures to maintain the  appropriate crosswind correction. If the pitch attitude remains excessively steep or if it is too flat, crosswind control during the  ground roll becomes more difficult. As the aircraft leaves the runway, the wings can be leveled as appropriate drift correction (crab)  is established.  

# Short-Field Takeoff  

With the exception of flap settings and initial climb speed as recommended by the manufacturer, there is little difference between the  techniques described above for normal takeoffs. After liftoff, the pitch attitude should be adjusted as required for obstacle clearance.  However, note that manufacturers of some airplanes, especially of higher power, recommend a short-field technique with liftoff in a  three-point attitude. Pilots should always review and follow the airplane manufacturer's recommended procedures.  

# Soft-Field Takeoff  

Wing flaps may be lowered prior to starting the takeoff (if recommended by the manufacturer) to provide additional lift and transfer  the airplane’s   weight from   the wheels    the wings   as early   as possible.   The airplane should   be taxied   onto   the takeoff   surface without  stopping on a soft surface since mud or snow might bog the airplane down. The airplane should be kept in continuous motion with  sufficient power while lining up for the takeoff roll. Due to the high power settings, it is usually best to have the elevator full up while  taxiing onto the runway in soft conditions. There is not only the danger of the airplane bogging down, but also a danger of it tipping  up onto its nose.  

As the airplane is aligned with the proposed takeoff path, takeoff power is applied smoothly and as rapidly as the powerplant will  accept without faltering. The tail should be kept very low to maintain the inherent positive AOA and to avoid any tendency of the  airplane to nose over as a result of soft spots, tall grass, or deep snow.  

When the airplane is held at a nose-high attitude throughout the takeoff run, the wings progressively relieve the wheels of more and  more of   the airplane’s   weight, thereby   minimizing   the drag   caused   by   surface irregularities   or   adhesion.   Once   airborne,   the airplane  should be allowed to accelerate to climb speed in ground effect.  

# Landing  

The difference between nose-wheel and tailwheel airplanes becomes apparent when discussing the touchdown and the period of  deceleration to taxi speed. In the nose-wheel design, touchdown is followed quite naturally by a reduction in pitch attitude to bring the  nose-wheel tire into contact with the runway. This pitch change reduces AOA, removes almost all wing lift, and rapidly transfers  aircraft weight to the tires.  

In tailwheel designs, this reduction of AOA and weight transfer are not practical and, as noted in the section on takeoffs, it is rare to  encounter tailwheel planes designed so that the wings are beyond critical AOA in the three-point attitude. In consequence, the  airplane continues to   “fly” in   the three-point attitude after touchdown, requiring careful attention to heading, roll, and pitch for an  extended period.  

# Touchdown  

Tailwheel airplanes are less forgiving of crosswind landing errors than nose-wheel models. It is important that touchdown occurs with  the airplane’s   longitudinal axis   parallel to   the direction   the airplane is   moving   along   the runway.   [Figure 14-2]  Failure to accomplish  this imposes side loads on the landing gear which leads to directional instability. To avoid side stresses and directional problems, the  pilot should not allow the airplane to touch down while in a crab or while drifting.  

There are two significantly different techniques used to manage tailwheel aircraft touchdowns: three-point and wheel landings. In the  first, the airplane is held off the surface of the runway until the attitude needed to remain aloft matches the geometry of the landing  gear. When touchdown occurs at this point, the main gear and the tailwheel make contact at the same time. In the second technique  (wheel landings), the airplane is allowed to touch down earlier in the process in a lower pitch attitude, so that the main gear touch  while the tail remains off the runway.  

![](images/76b8e9538ab7ab6f88cf87ce1fc0eddec7b4349485d5a690c600c9308ee3c0b0.jpg)  
Figure 14-2.  Tailwheel touchdown.  

# Three-Point Landing  

As with all landings, success begins with an orderly arrival: airspeed, alignment, and configuration well in hand crossing the  threshold. Round out (level-off) should be made with the main wheels about one foot off the surface. From that point forward, the  technique is essentially the same that is used in nose-wheels: a gentle increase in AOA to maintain flight while slowing. In a tailwheel  aircraft, however, the goal is to attain a much steeper fuselage angle than that commonly used in nose-wheel models; one that touches  the tailwheels at the same time as the main wheels.  

With the tailwheel on the surface, a further increase in pitch attitude is impossible, so the plane remains on the runway, albeit  tenuously. With deceleration, weight shifts increasingly from wings to wheels, with the final result that the plane once again becomes  a ground vehicle after shedding most of its speed.  

There are two potential errors in attempting a three-point landing. In the first, the main wheels are allowed to make runway contact a  little early with the tail still in the air. With the CG aft of themain wheells, the tail naturally drops when thmain wheelels touch, AOA  increases, and   the plane may   become airborne again.   This   “skip” is   easily   managed   by   re-flaring and again trying to hold the plane  off until reaching the three-point attitude.   A   large “skip” or   bounce   may   result in   being   high   above the runway   with   insufficient  energy. In these circumstances, the pilot should execute a go-around.  

In the second error, the plane is held off the ground a bit too long so that the in-flight pitch attitude is steeper than the three-point  attitude. When touchdown is made in this attitude, the tail makes contact first. Provided this happens from no more than a foot off the  surface, the result is undramatic: the tail touches, the plane pitches forward slightly onto the main wheels, and rollout proceeds  normally.  

In every case, once the tailwheel makes contact, the elevator control should be eased fully back to press the tailwheel on the runway.  Without this elevator input, the AOA of the horizontal stabilizer develops enough lift to lighten pressure on the tailwheel and render it  useless as a directional control with possibly unwelcomed consequences. This after-landing elevator input is quite foreign to nose- wheel pilots and needs to be stressed during transition training.  

Note: Before the tailwheel is on the ground, application of full back elevator during the flare lowers the tail, increases the AOA, and  quite naturally puts the plane in climbing flight.  

# Wheel Landing  

In some wind conditions, the need to retain control authority may make it desirable to make contact with the runway at a higher  airspeed than that associated with the three-point attitude. This necessitates landing in a flatter pitch attitude on the main wheels only,  with the tailwheel still off the surface.  [Figure 14-3]  As noted, if the tail is off the ground, it tends to drop and put the plane airborne,  so a soft touchdown and a slight relaxation of back elevator just after the wheels touch are key ingredients to a successful wheel  landing.  

Once the main wheels are on the surface, the tail should be permitted to drop on its own accord until it too makes ground contact. At  this point, the elevator should be brought to the full aft position and deceleration should be allowed to proceed as in a three-point  landing.  

![](images/c4f57a6070e319b179383e0fcfd45c6175cf6588af4dc3f3cec22f172f1d9b50.jpg)  
Figure 14-3.  Wheel landing.  

If the touchdown is made at too high a rate of descent, the tail is forced down by its own weight, resulting in a sudden increase in lift.  If the pilot now pushes forward in an attempt to again make contact with the surface, a potentially dangerous pilot-induced oscillation  may develop. It is far better to respond to a bounced wheel landing attempt by initiating a go-around or converting to a three-point  landing if conditions permit.  

Note: The only difference between three-point and wheel landings is the timing of the touchdown (early and later). There is no  difference between the approach angles and airspeeds in the two techniques.  

# Crosswinds  

As noted, it is highly desirable to eliminate crab and drift at touchdown. By far the best approach to crosswind management is a side­ slip or wing-low touchdown. Landing in this attitude, only one main wheel makes initial contact, either in concert with the tailwheel  in three-point landings or by itself in wheel landings. Many tailwheel pilots prefer completing a wheel landing in a crosswind, as the  initial touchdown speed is higher than for a three-point landing, making the flight controls more effective. In addition, in some  aircraft, the rudder effectiveness can be reduced by the blocking effect of the fuselage and flaps with the tail low and on the ground.  

# After-Landing Roll  

The landing process should never be considered complete until the airplane decelerates to the normal taxi speed during the landing  roll or has been brought to a complete stop when clear of the landing area. The pilot should be alert for directional control difficulties  immediately upon and after touchdown, and the elevator control should be held back as far as possible and as firmly as possible until  the airplane stops. This provides more positive control with tailwheel steering, tends to shorten the after-landing roll, and prevents  bouncing and skipping.  

Any difference between the direction the airplane is traveling and the direction it is headed (drift or crab) produces a moment about  the pivot point of the wheels, and the airplane tends to swerve. Loss of directional control may lead to an aggravated, uncontrolled,  tight turn on the ground, or a ground loop. The combination of inertia acting on the CG and ground friction of the main wheels during  the ground loop may cause the airplane to tip enough for the outside wingtip to contact the ground and may even impose a sideward  force that could collapse one landing gear leg.  [Figure 14-4]  In general, this combination of events is eliminated by landing straight  and avoiding turns at higher than normal running speed.  

![](images/7b4a06f066beb5cfd2d83a7ac0878eb1cd03c9bf88cefdb44db2801c85444a7a.jpg)  
Figure 14-4.  Effect of CG on directional control.  

To use the brakes, the pilot should slide the toes or feet up from the rudder pedals to the brake pedals (or apply heel pressure in  airplanes equipped with heel brakes). If rudder pressure is being held at the time braking action is needed, that pressure should not be  released as the feet or toes are being slid up to the brake pedals because control may be lost before brakes can be applied. During the  ground   roll, the airplane’s   direction   of   movement may   be changed   by   carefully   applying   pressure on   one brake or   uneven   pressures on  each brake in the desired direction. Caution should be exercised when applying brakes to avoid overcontrolling.  

If a wing starts to rise, aileron control should be applied toward that wing to lower it. The amount required depends on speed because  as the forward speed of the airplane decreases, the ailerons become less effective.  

If available runway permits, the speed of the airplane should be allowed to dissipate in a normal manner by the friction and drag of  the wheels on the ground. Brakes may be used if needed to help slow the airplane. After the airplane has been slowed sufficiently and  has been turned onto a taxiway or clear of the landing area, it should be brought to a complete stop. Only after this is done should the  pilot retract the flaps and perform other checklist items.  

# Crosswind After-Landing Roll  

Particularly during the after-landing roll, special attention should be given to maintaining directional control by the use of rudder and  tailwheel steering while keeping the upwind wing from rising by the use of aileron. Characteristically, an airplane has a greater profile  or side area behind the main landing gear than forward of it. With the main wheels acting as a pivot point and the greater surface area  exposed to the crosswind behind that pivot point, the airplane tends to turn or weathervane into the wind.  [Figure 14-5]  This  weathervaning tendency is more prevalent in the tailwheel-type because the airplane’s   surface area   behind   the main   landing   gear    greater than in nose-wheel-type airplanes.  

Pilots should be familiar with the crosswind component of each airplane they fly and avoid operations in wind conditions that exceed  the capability of the airplane, as well as their own limitations. While the airplane is decelerating during the after-landing roll, more  aileron should be applied to keep the upwind wing from rising. Since the airplane is slowing down, there is less airflow around the  ailerons and they become less effective. At the same time, the relative wind is becoming more of a crosswind and exerting a greater  lifting force on the upwind wing. Consequently, when the airplane is coming to a stop, the aileron control should be held fully toward  the wind.  

![](images/60b0877cf94137b602e76629c3388bb7cadda18a56b7d666eef39ca74c672e3e.jpg)  
Figure 14-5.  Weathervaning tendency.  

# Short-Field Landing  

Upon touchdown, the airplane should be firmly held in a three-point attitude. This provides aerodynamic braking by the wings.  Immediately upon touchdown and closing the throttle, the brakes should be applied evenly and firmly to minimize the after-landing  roll. The airplane should be stopped within the shortest possible distance consistent with safety.  

# Soft-Field Landing  

The tailwheel should touchdown simultaneously with or just before the main wheels and should then be held down by maintaining  firm back-elevator pressure throughout the landing roll. This minimizes any tendency for the airplane to nose over and provides  aerodynamic braking. The use of brakes on a soft field is not needed because the soft or rough surface itself provides sufficient  reduction    the airplane’s   forward   speed.   Often,   it is   found   that upon   landing   on   a very   soft field,   the pilot needs    increase power to  keep the airplane moving and from becoming stuck in the soft surface.  

# Ground Loop  

A ground loop is an uncontrolled turn during ground operations that may occur during taxi, takeoff, or during the after-landing roll.  Ground loops start with a swerve that is allowed to continue for too long. The swerve may be the result of side-load on landing, a taxi  turn started with too much groundspeed, overcorrection, or even an uneven ground surface or a soft spot that retards one main wheel  of the airplane.  

Due to the inbuilt instability of the tailwheel design, the forces that lead to a ground loop accumulate as the angle between the  fuselage and inertia, acting from the CG, increase. If allowed to develop, these forces may become great enough to tip the airplane to  the outside of the turn until one wing strikes the ground.  

To counteract the possibility of an uncontrolled turn, the pilot should counter any swerve with firm rudder input. In stronger swerves,  differential braking is essential as tailwheel steering proves inadequate. It is important to note, however, that as corrections begin to  become apparent, rudder and braking inputs need to be removed promptly to avoid starting yet another departure in the opposite  direction.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter focuses on the operational differences between tailwheel and nose-wheel airplanes that occur during ground operations,  takeoffs, and landings. The chapter covers specific topics, such as landing gear, taxiing, visibility, liftoff, and landing. Comparisons  are given as to how each react during the takeoff and landing, as well as situations that should be avoided. Pilots who use proper  rudder control techniques should be able to transition to tailwheel airplanes without too much difficulty.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 15: Transition to Turbopropeller-Powered Airplanes  

# Introduction  

The turbopropeller-powered airplane flies and handles just like any other airplane of comparable size and weight, since the  aerodynamics are the same. The major differences between flying a turboprop and other non-turbine-powered airplanes are found in  the handling   of   the airplane’s   powerplant and   its   associated   systems,   which   are unique to   gas turbine engines. The turbopropeller­ powered airplane also has the advantage of being equipped with a constant speed, full feathering and reversing propeller—something  normally not found on piston-powered airplanes.  

# Gas Turbine Engine  

Both piston (reciprocating) engines and gas turbine engines are internal combustion engines. They have a similar cycle of operation  that consists of induction, compression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust. In a piston engine, each of these events is a separate  distinct occurrence in each cylinder. Also in a piston engine, an ignition event occurs during each cycle in each cylinder. Unlike  reciprocating engines, in gas turbine engines these phases of power occur simultaneously and continuously instead of successively  one cycle at a time. Additionally, ignition occurs during the starting cycle and is continuous thereafter. The basic gas turbine engine  contains four sections: intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust.  [Figure 15-1]  

![](images/dac52ab0272f7e54237ef7b91b05492fcc8c35b3b9f06b61b5e4a2f7e6d09e12.jpg)  
Figure 15-1.  Basic components of a gas turbine engine.  

To start a gas turbine engine, the compressor section is normally rotated by an electric starter. As compressor revolutions per minute  (rpm) increase, air flowing through the inlet is compressed to a high pressure, delivered to the combustion section, and ignited. In gas  turbine engines, not all of the compressed air is used to support combustion. Some of the compressed air bypasses the burner section  within the engine to provide internal cooling. The fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber burns in a continuous combustion  process   and   produces   a very   high   temperature,   typically   around    $_{4,000^{\circ}}$   Fahrenheit (F).   When   this   hot air   mixes with   bypass   air, the  temperature of the mixed air mass drops to 1,600 –  $1{,}600-2{,}400\ {^\circ}\mathrm{F}$    The mixture of   hot air   and   gases   expands   and   passes through   the turbine  blades forcing the turbine section to rotate. The turbine drives the compressor section by means of a direct shaft, a concentric shaft, or  a combination of both. After powering the turbine section, the combustion gases and bypass air flow out of the engine through the  exhaust. Once the hot gases from the burner section provide sufficient power to maintain engine operation through the turbine, the  starter is de-energized, and the starting sequence ends. Combustion continues until the engine is shut down by cutting off the fuel  supply.  

Note: Because compression produces heat and pressure, some pneumatic aircraft systems tap into the source of hot compressed air  from the engine compressor (bleed air) and use it for engine anti-ice, airfoil anti-ice, aircraft pressurization, and other ancillary  systems after further conditioning its internal pressure and temperature.  

# Turboprop Engines  

The turbojet engine (discussed in more detail in the Transition to Jet-Powered Airplanes chapter) excels the reciprocating engine in  top speed and altitude performance. On the other hand, the turbojet engine has limited takeoff and initial climb performance when  compared to its overall performance. In the matter of takeoff and initial climb performance, the reciprocating engine with a constant  speed propeller produces maximum thrust on takeoff. Turbojet engines are most efficient at high speeds and high altitudes, while  propellers are most efficient at slow and medium speeds (less than 400 miles per hour (mph)). Propellers also improve takeoff and  climb performance. The development of the turboprop engine was an attempt to combine the best characteristics of both the turbojet  and propeller-driven reciprocating engine.  

The turboprop engine offers several advantages over other types of engines, such as:  

1. Light weight  2. Mechanical reliability due to relatively few moving parts  3. Simplicity of operation  4. Minimum vibration  5. High power per unit of weight  6. Use of propeller for takeoff and landing  

Turboprop engines are most efficient at speeds between 250 and 400 mph and altitudes between 18,000 and 30,000 feet. They also  perform well at the slow speeds required for takeoff and landing and are fuel efficient. The minimum specific fuel consumption of the  turboprop engine is normally available in the altitude range of 25,000 feet up to the tropopause.  

The power output of a piston engine is measured in horsepower and is determined primarily by rpm and manifold pressure. The  power of a turboprop engine, however, is measured in shaft horsepower (shp). Shaft horsepower is determined by the rpm and the  torque (twisting moment) applied to the propeller shaft. Since turboprop engines are gas turbine engines, some jet thrust is produced  by exhaust leaving the engine. This thrust is added to the shaft horsepower to determine the total engine power or equivalent shaft  horsepower (eshp). Jet thrust usually accounts for less than 10 percent of the total engine power.  

Although the turboprop engine is more complicated and heavier than a turbojet engine of equivalent size and power, it delivers more  thrust at low subsonic airspeeds. However, the advantages decrease as flight speed increases. In normal cruising speed ranges, the  propulsive efficiency (output divided by input) of a turboprop decreases as speed increases.  

The propeller of a typical turboprop engine is responsible for roughly 90 percent of the total thrust under sea level conditions on a  standard day. The excellent performance of a turboprop during takeoff and climb is the result of the ability of the propeller to  accelerate a large mass   of   air   while the airplane is   moving   at a relatively   low   ground   and   flight speed.   “Turboprop,” however, should  not be confused   with   “turbo   supercharged” or   similar   terminology.   All turbine engines have a similarity   to   normally   aspirated   (non­ supercharged) reciprocating engines in that maximum available power decreases almost as a direct function of increased altitude.  

Although power decreases as the airplane climbs to higher altitudes, engine efficiency in terms of specific fuel consumption  (expressed as pounds of fuel consumed per horsepower per hour) is increased. Decreased specific fuel consumption plus the  increased true airspeed at higher altitudes is a definite advantage of a turboprop engine.  

All turbine engines should operate within their limiting temperatures, rotational speeds, and (in the case of turboprops) torque.  Depending on the installation, the primary parameter for power setting might be temperature, torque, fuel flow, or rpm (either  propeller rpm, gas generator (compressor) rpm, or both). In cold weather conditions, torque limits can be exceeded while temperature  limits are still within acceptable range. In hot weather conditions, the maximum temperature limits may be exceeded without  exceeding torque limits. In any weather, reaching one of these operating limits normally occurs before the pilot moves the throttles to  the full forward position. The transitioning pilot should understand the importance of knowing and observing limits on turbine  engines. An over temperature or over torque condition that lasts for more than a few seconds can destroy internal engine components.  

# Turboprop Engine Types  

Fixed-Shaft  

One type of turboprop engine is the fixed-shaft constant-speed type, such as the Garrett TPE331.  [Figure 15-2]  In this type engine,  ambient air is directed to the compressor section through the engine inlet. An acceleration/diffusion process in the two-stage  compressor increases air pressure and directs it rearward to a combustor. The combustor is made up of a combustion chamber, a  transition liner, and a turbine plenum. Atomized fuel is added to the air in the combustion chamber. Air also surrounds the  combustion chamber to provide for cooling and insulation of the combustor.  

![](images/542d94c0ca407642b347e9b82c23ebe4f5ca85c09ad2ce5ef17138d8f5faccd0.jpg)  
Figure 15-2.  Fixed-shaft turboprop engine.  

The gas mixture is initially ignited by high-energy igniter plugs, and the expanding combustion gases flow to the turbine. The energy  of the hot, high-velocity gases is converted to torque on the main shaft by the turbine rotors. The reduction gear converts the high  rpm—low torque of the main shaft to low rpm—high torque to drive the accessories and the propeller. The spent gases leaving the  turbine are directed to the atmosphere by the exhaust pipe.  

Most of the air passing through the engine provides internal cooling. Only about 10 percent of the air that passes through the engine is  actually used in the combustion process. Up to approximately 20 percent of the compressed air may be bled off for the purpose of  heating, cooling, cabin pressurization, and pneumatic systems. Over half the engine power is devoted to driving the compressor, and  it is the compressor that can potentially produce very high drag in the case of a failed, windmilling engine.  

In the fixed-shaft constant-speed engine, the engine rpm may be varied within a narrow range of 96 percent to 100 percent. During  ground operation, the rpm may be reduced to 70 percent. In flight, the engine operates at a constant speed that is maintained by the  governing section of the propeller. Power changes are made by increasing fuel flow and propeller blade angle rather than engine  speed. An increase in fuel flow causes an increase in temperature and a corresponding increase in energy available to the turbine. The  turbine absorbs more energy and transmits it to the propeller in the form of torque. The increased torque forces the propeller blade  angle to be increased to maintain the constant speed. Turbine temperature is a very important factor to be considered in power  production. It is directly related to fuel flow and thus to the power produced. It needs to be limited because of strength and durability  of the material in the combustion and turbine section. The control system schedules fuel flow to produce specific temperatures and to  limit those temperatures so that the temperature tolerances of the combustion and turbine sections are not exceeded. The engine is  designed to operate for its entire life at 100 percent. All of its components, such as compressors and turbines, are most efficient when  operated at or near the rpm design point.  

Powerplant (engine and propeller) control is achieved by means of a power lever and a condition lever for each engine.  [Figure 15-3]  There is no mixture control and/or rpm lever as found on piston-engine airplanes.  

On the fixed-shaft constant-speed turboprop engine, the power lever is advanced or retarded to increase or decrease forward thrust.  The power lever is also used to provide reverse thrust. The condition lever sets the desired engine rpm within a narrow range between  that appropriate for ground operations and flight.  

![](images/3886f6d2939bc2f21e01fd2f2f43b1fffaf25ddcfd0c2061f4e868411c3901e9.jpg)  
Figure 15-3.  Powerplant controls—fixed-shaft turboprop engine.  

Powerplant instrumentation in a fixed-shaft turboprop engine typically consists of the following basic indicators.  [Figure 15-4]  

1. Torque or horsepower  2. Interturbine temperature (ITT)  3. Fuel flow  4. RPM  

![](images/63c55f9a281e9e77850ca807f3c52b201b1118c872c683ef5dc5b0025d88a0f2.jpg)  
Figure 15-4.  Powerplant instrumentation—fixed-shaft turboprop engine.  

Torque developed by the turbine section is measured by a torque sensor. The torque is then reflected on the instrument panel  horsepower gauge calibrated in horsepower times 100. ITT is a measurement of the combustion gas temperature between the first and  second stages of the turbine section. The gauge is calibrated in degrees Celsius   $(^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$  . Propeller rpm is reflected on a tachometer as a  percentage of maximum rpm. Normally, a vernier indicator on the gauge dial indicates rpm in 1 percent graduations as well. The fuel  flow indicator indicates fuel flow rate in pounds per hour.  

Propeller feathering in a fixed-shaft constant-speed turboprop engine is normally accomplished with the condition lever. An engine  failure in this type engine, however, results in a serious drag condition due to the large power requirements of the compressor being  absorbed by the propeller. This could create a serious airplane control problem in twin-engine airplanes unless the failure is  recognized immediately and the affected propeller feathered. For this reason, the fixed-shaft turboprop engine is equipped with  negative torque sensing (NTS).  

NTS is a condition wherein propeller torque drives the engine, and the propeller is automatically driven to high pitch to reduce drag.  The function of the negative torque sensing system is to limit the torque the engine can extract from the propeller during windmilling  and thereby prevent large drag forces on the airplane. The NTS system causes a movement of the propeller blades automatically  toward their feathered position should the engine suddenly lose power while in flight. The NTS system is an emergency backup  system in the event of sudden engine failure. It is not a substitution for the feathering device controlled by the condition lever.  

# Split-Shaft/Free Turbine Engine  

In a free power-turbine engine, such as the Pratt & Whitney PT-6 engine, the propeller is driven by a separate turbine through  reduction gearing. The propeller is not on the same shaft as the basic engine turbine and compressor.  [Figure 15-5]  Unlike the fixed- shaft engine, in the split-shaft engine the propeller can be feathered in flight or on the ground with the basic engine still running. The  free power-turbine design allows the pilot to select a desired propeller governing rpm, regardless of basic engine rpm.  

![](images/1676a21e800ed1fd84f4d5e589de0bf0443745347d34575122ca4f69559917b8.jpg)  
Figure 15-5.  Split shaft/free turbine engine.  

A typical free power-turbine engine has two independent counter-rotating turbines. One turbine drives the compressor, while the other  drives the propeller through a reduction gearbox. The compressor in the basic engine consists of three axial flow compressor stages  combined with a single centrifugal compressor stage. The axial and centrifugal stages are assembled on the same shaft and operate as  a single unit.  

Inlet air enters the engine via a circular plenum near the rear of the engine and flows forward through the successive compressor  stages. The flow is directed outward by the centrifugal compressor stage through radial diffusers before entering the combustion  chamber, where the flow direction is actually reversed. The gases produced by combustion are once again reversed to expand forward  through each turbine stage. After leaving the turbines, the gases are collected in a peripheral exhaust scroll and are discharged to the  atmosphere through two exhaust ports near the front of the engine.  

A pneumatic fuel control system schedules fuel flow to maintain the power set by the gas generator power lever. Except in the beta  range, propeller speed within the governing range remains constant at any selected propeller control lever position through the action  of a propeller governor.  

The accessory drive at the aft end of the engine provides power to drive fuel pumps, fuel control, oil pumps, a starter/generator, and a  tachometer transmitter. At this point, the speed of the drive   $(\mathbf{N}_{1})$   is the true speed of the compressor side of the engine,  approximately 37,500 rpm.  

Powerplant (engine and propeller) operation is achieved by three sets of controls for each engine: the power lever, propeller lever,  and condition lever.  [Figure 15-6]  The power lever serves to control engine power in the range from idle through takeoff power.  Forward or aft motion of the power lever increases or decreases gas generator rpm   $(\mathbf{N}_{1})$   and thereby increases or decreases engine  power. The propeller lever is operated conventionally and controls the constant-speed propellers through the primary governor. The  propeller rpm range is normally from 1,500 to 1,900. The condition lever controls the flow of fuel to the engine. Like the mixture  lever in a piston-powered airplane, the condition lever is located at the far right of the power quadrant. But the condition lever on a  turboprop engine is really just an on/off valve for delivering fuel. There are HIGH IDLE and LOW IDLE positions for ground  operations, but condition levers have no metering function. Leaning is not required in turbine engines; this function is performed  automatically by a dedicated fuel control unit.  

![](images/4b48a3b8e0a35ed805576453b5a7d82082bad3e4b88ae704789c7dfacd11d080.jpg)  
Figure 15-6.  Powerplant controls—split-shaft/free turbine engine.  

Engine instruments in a split-shaft/free turbine engine typically consist of the following basic indicators.  [Figure 15-7]  

1.   ITT indicator  2.   Torquemeter  3.   Propeller tachometer  4.  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$    (gas generator) tachometer  5.   Fuel flow indicator  6.   Oil temperature/pressure indicator  

![](images/1f14d0584681c93dbc00ffa4f5c1f9b4672c8e70495f34dd27dba1e93d3473e0.jpg)  
Figure 15-7.  Engine instruments—split shaft/free turbine engine.  

The ITT indicator gives an instantaneous reading of engine gas temperature between the compressor turbine and the power turbines.  The torquemeter responds to power lever movement and gives an indication in foot-pounds (ft/lb) of the torque being applied to the  propeller. Because in the free turbine engine the propeller is not attached physically to the shaft of the gas turbine engine, two  tachometers are justified—one for the propeller and one for the gas generator. The propeller tachometer is read directly in revolutions  per minute. The  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$    or gas generator is read in percent of rpm. In the Pratt & Whitney PT-6 engine, it is based on a figure of 37,000  rpm at 100 percent. Maximum continuous gas generator is limited to   $38{,}100\,\mathrm{rpm}$   or 101.5 percent   $\mathbf{N}_{1}$  .  

The ITT indicator and torquemeter are used to set takeoff power. Climb and cruise power are established with the torquemeter and  propeller tachometer while observing ITT limits. Gas generator   $(\mathbf{N}_{1})$   operation is monitored by the gas generator tachometer. Proper  observation and interpretation of these instruments provide an indication of engine performance and condition.  

# Reverse Thrust and Beta Range Operations  

The thrust that a propeller provides is a function of the angle of attack (AOA) at which the air strikes the blades, and the speed at  which this occurs. The AOA varies with the pitch angle of the propeller.  

Forward pitch produces forward thrust—higher pitch angles being required at higher airplane speeds.  [Figure 15-8A]  So   called   “flat  pitch,”   shown   in   Figure 15-8B,  is the blade position offering minimum resistance to rotation and no net thrust for moving the  airplane.  

![](images/24c2fd713aad07b2f650840150ea595aaf3fa6c1dbe25f68a5c0c5f0418ec5d3.jpg)  
Figure 15-8A.  Propeller forward pitch angle characteristics.  

![](images/ae916f770317965028494945cadbf3f06d2b2de50d20f9e86d9c48e2721b6352.jpg)  
Figure 15-8B.  Propeller flat pitch characteristics.  

The “feathered” position    the highest pitch   angle obtainable.   [Figure 15-8C]  The feathered position produces no forward thrust.  The propeller is generally placed in feather only in case of in-flight engine failure to minimize drag and prevent the air from using the  propeller as a turbine.  

![](images/4b6f00435683617f2c3505f85b7f8e834944c514ef6cc5f4448f4b24bc4d8c1e.jpg)  
Figure 15-8C.  Propeller feather (maximum forward pitch angle) characteristics.  

In   the “reverse”   pitch   position,   the engine/propeller   turns   in   the same direction   as in   the normal (forward)   pitch   position,   but the  propeller blade angle is positioned to the other side of flat pitch.  [Figure 15-8D]  In reverse pitch, air is pushed away from the  airplane rather than being drawn over it. Reverse pitch results in braking action, rather than forward thrust of the airplane. It is used  for backing away from obstacles when taxiing, controlling taxi speed, or to aid in bringing the airplane to a stop during the landing  roll. Reverse pitch does not mean reverse rotation of the engine. The engine delivers power just the same, no matter which side of flat  pitch the propeller blades are positioned.  

![](images/24c72ae09279a9c53b6d9b0da88613b087e46a71387406787219e16db8c85a80.jpg)  
Figure 15-8D.  Propeller reverse pitch characteristics.  

With a turboprop engine, in order to obtain enough power for flight, the power lever is placed somewhere between flight idle (in  some engines referred   to   as “high   idle”)   and   maximum.   The power   lever   directs   signals to   a fuel control unit to   manually   select fuel.  The propeller governor selects the propeller pitch needed to keep the propeller/engine on speed. This is referred to as the propeller  governing   or   “alpha”   mode of   operation.   When   positioned   aft of   flight idle,   however,   the power   lever   directly   controls   propeller blade  angle.   This    known   as the “beta”   range of   operation.  

The beta range of operation consists of power lever positions from flight idle to maximum reverse. Beginning at power lever positions  just aft of flight idle, propeller blade pitch angles become progressively flatter with aft movement of the power lever until they go  beyond maximum flat pitch and into negative pitch, resulting in reverse thrust. While in a fixed-shaft/constant-speed engine, the  engine speed remains largely unchanged as the propeller blade angles achieve their negative values. On the split-shaft PT-6 engine, as  the negative   $5^{\circ}$   position is reached, further aft movement of the power lever also results in a progressive increase in engine   $(\mathbf{N}_{1})$   rpm  until a maximum value of about negative   $11^{\circ}$   of blade angle and 85 percent  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$   are achieved.  

Operating in the beta range and/or with reverse thrust requires specific techniques and procedures depending on the particular  airplane make and model. Specific engine parameters and limitations for operations within this area should be adhered to. It is  essential that a pilot transitioning to turboprop airplanes becomes knowledgeable and proficient in these areas, which are unique to  turbine-engine powered airplanes.  

# Turboprop Airplane Electrical Systems  

The typical turboprop airplane electrical system is a 28-volt direct current (DC) system, which receives power from one or more  batteries and a starter/generator for each engine. The batteries are either lead-acid, nickel-cadmium (NiCad), or Lithium-ion. When  battery voltage is low, its ability to turn the compressor for engine start is greatly diminished, and the possibility of engine damage  due to   a hot start increases. Therefore,   it is   essential to   check   the battery’s   condition   before every   engine start. The different battery  types have different operating characteristics depending on the specific aircraft installation and operational environment.  

The DC   generators   used    turboprop   airplanes double as starter   motors   and   are called   “starter/generators.” The starter/generator uses  electrical power   to   produce   mechanical torque to   start the engine and   then   uses the engine’s   mechanical torque to   produce   electrical  power after the engine is running. Some of the DC power produced is changed to 28 volt 400 cycle alternating current (AC) power for  certain avionic, lighting, and indicator synchronization functions. This is accomplished by an electrical component called an inverter.  

The distribution of DC and AC power throughout the system is accomplished through the use of power distribution buses. These  “buses” as they   are called   are actually   common   terminals from   which   individual electrical circuits   get their   power.   [Figure 15-9]  

![](images/b430eef06d21410ac25c2b413c02681cda154092289842ea83f873e8cadd2974.jpg)  
Figure 15-9.  Typical individual power distribution bus.  

Buses are usually named for what they power (avionics bus, for example) or for where they get their power (right generator bus,  battery bus). The distribution of DC and AC power is often divided into functional groups (buses) that give priority to certain  equipment during   normal and   emergency   operations.   Main   buses serve most of   the airplane’s   electrical equipment. Essential buses  feed power to equipment having top priority.  [Figure 15-10]  

![](images/fc6f6c27248d866ba4d8a7a831cbc0a48eddd95848b8e4072bae133b6e43c6eb.jpg)  
Figure 15-10.  Simplified schematic of turboprop airplane electrical system.  

Multiengine turboprop airplanes normally have several power sources—at least one generator per engine and at least one battery for  the airplane. The electrical systems are usually designed so that any bus can be energized by any of the power sources. For example, a  typical system has a left and right engine generator-powered bus. While these buses are normally isolated, they may be fed from other  power sources. However, in the event of a short-circuit, the bus remains isolated. Pilots should refer to the appropriate checklist when  an electrical fault occurs.  

Power distribution buses are protected from short circuits and other malfunctions by a type of fuse called a current limiter. In the case  of excessive current supplied by any power source, the current limiter opens the circuit and thereby isolates that power source and  separates the affected bus from the system. If this occurs, pilots should refer to the appropriate checklist.  

# Operational Considerations  

As previously stated, a turboprop airplane flies just like any other piston engine airplane of comparable size and weight. It is the  operation of the engines and airplane systems that makes the turboprop airplane different from its piston engine counterpart. Pilot  errors in engine and/or systems operation are common causes of aircraft damage or loss of aircraft control. There are two engine- related issues that should be considered when a pilot transitions to turboprop operations.  

The first issue concerns the split-shaft/free turbine engine, where power output lags for several seconds when the pilot moves the  power lever from flight idle to a high power setting. This delay may surprise a pilot who has only flown airplanes with a piston  engine (or a fixed-shaft turboprop). Certain operations such as firefighting and agricultural application require maneuvering close to  the ground while operating at or near flight idle. Although smooth power applications are still the rule, the pilot should be aware that  a greater physical movement of the power levers is required as compared to throttle movement in a piston engine. The pilot should  understand the lag and anticipate and lead the power changes more than in the past and should keep in mind that the last 30 percent of  engine rpm represents the majority of the engine thrust. Below that setting, the application of power has very little effect.  

A second consideration for transitioning pilots concerns turbine engine heat sensitivity. A turbine engine cannot tolerate an over  temperature condition for more than a very seconds without experiencing serious damage. Engine temperatures get hotter during  starting than at any other time. Thus, turbine engines have minimum rotational speeds for introducing fuel into the combustion  chambers during startup. Vigilant monitoring of temperature and acceleration on the part of the pilot remain crucial until the engine is  running at a stable speed. Successful engine starting depends on assuring the correct minimum battery voltage before initiating start or  employing a ground power unit (GPU) of adequate output.  

After   fuel is   introduced   to   the combustion   chamber   during   the start sequence,   “light-off” and   its   associated   heat rise occur   very quickly. Engine temperatures may approach the maximum in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds before the engine stabilizes and temperatures  fall into the normal operating range. During this time, the pilot should watch for any tendency of the temperatures to exceed  limitations and be prepared to cut off fuel to the engine.  

An engine tendency to exceed maximum starting temperature limits is termed a hot start. The temperature rise may be preceded by  unusually high initial fuel flow, which may be the first indication the pilot has that the engine start is not proceeding normally. Serious  engine damage occurs if the hot start is allowed to continue.  

A condition where the engine is accelerating more slowly than normal is termed a hung start or false start. During a hung start/false  start, the engine may stabilize at an engine rpm that is not high enough for the engine to continue to run without help from the starter.  This is usually the result of low battery power or the starter not turning the engine fast enough for it to start properly.  

Takeoffs in turboprop airplanes are not made by automatically pushing the power lever full forward to the stops. As stated earlier,  depending on conditions, takeoff power may be limited by either torque or by engine temperature. Normally, the power lever position  on takeoff is somewhat aft of full forward.  

Takeoff and departure in a turboprop airplane (especially a twin-engine cabin-class airplane) should be accomplished in accordance  with   a standard   takeoff   and   departure “profile” developed   for   the particular   make and   model.   [Figure 15-11]  The takeoff and  departure profile should   be in   accordance   with   the airplane manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures as outlined   in   the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved   Airplane Flight Manual and/or   the Pilot’s   Operating   Handbook   (AFM/POH).   The  increased complexity of turboprop airplanes makes the standardization of procedures a necessity for safe and efficient operation. The  transitioning pilot should review the profile procedures before each takeoff to form a mental picture of the takeoff and departure  process.  

![](images/56b4ccdc8157dee37092484048e3f7bc8e70ec4a4a592f0fe1657ed06afdfb5d.jpg)  
Figure 15-11.  Example of a typical turboprop airplane takeoff and departure profile.  

For any given high-horsepower operation, the pilot can expect that the engine temperature will climb as altitude increases at a  constant power. On a warm or hot day, maximum temperature limits may be reached at a rather low altitude, making it impossible to  maintain   high   horsepower   to   higher   altitudes. Also,   the engine’s   compressor   section   has to   work   harder   with   decreased   air   density.  Power capability is reduced by high-density altitude and power use may have to be modulated to keep engine temperature within  limits.  

In a turboprop airplane, the pilot can close the throttles(s) at any time without concern for cooling the engine too rapidly.  Consequently, rapid descents with the propellers in low pitch can be dramatically steep. Like takeoffs and departures, approach and  landing should be accomplished in accordance with a standard approach and landing profile.  [Figure 15-12]  However, when flying  an airplane equipped with a split shaft/free turbine engine, the pilot should anticipate the demand for power and account for any lag in  “spool-up” time.  

![](images/3f0546bdc17a44969234f34cd4cd917e6da81b9f0574051841d3132b7a407244.jpg)  
Figure 15-12.  Example of a typical turboprop airplane arrival and landing profile.  

A stabilized approach is an essential part of the approach and landing process. In a stabilized approach, the airplane, depending on  design   and   type,    placed   in   a stabilized   descent on   a glidepath   ranging   from   2.5   to    $3.5^{\circ}$  . The speed    stabilized   at some reference  from the AFM/POH—usually 1.25 to 1.30 times the stall speed in approach configuration. The descent rate is stabilized from 500  fpm to 700 fpm until the landing flare.  

Landing some turboprop airplanes (as well as some piston twins) can result in a hard, premature touchdown if the engines are idled  too soon. This is because large propellers spinning rapidly in low pitch create considerable drag. In such airplanes, it may be  preferable to maintain power throughout the landing flare and touchdown. Once firmly on the ground, propeller beta range operation  dramatically reduces the need for braking in comparison to piston airplanes of similar weight.  

# Training Considerations  

The medium and high altitudes at which turboprop airplanes are flown provide an entirely different environment in terms of  regulatory requirements, airspace structure, physiological requirements, and even meteorology. The pilot transitioning to turboprop  airplanes, particularly those who are not familiar with operations in the high/medium altitude environment, should approach  turboprop transition training with this in mind. Thorough ground training should cover all aspects of high/medium altitude flight,  including the flight environment, weather, flight planning and navigation, physiological aspects of high-altitude flight, oxygen and  pressurization system operation, and high-altitude emergencies.  

Flight training should prepare the pilot to demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of airplane performance, systems, emergency  procedures, and operating limitations, along with a high degree of proficiency in performing all flight maneuvers and in-flight  emergency procedures. The training outline below covers information used by pilots to operate safely at high altitudes.

# Chapter Summary  

Transitioning from a non-turbopropeller airplane to a turbopropeller-powered airplane is discussed in this chapter. The major  differences are introduced specifically handling, powerplant, and the associated systems. Turbopropeller electrical systems and  operational considerations are explained to include starting procedures and high temperature considerations. Training considerations  are also discussed and a sample training syllabus is given to show the topics that a pilot should become proficient in when  transitioning to a turbopropeller-powered airplane.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 16: Transition to Jet-Powered Airplanes  

# Introduction  

This chapter contains an overview of jet-powered airplane operations. The information contained in this chapter provides a useful  preparation for, and a supplement to, structured jet airplane qualification training. This chapter provides information on major  differences a pilot may encounter when transitioning to jet-powered airplanes. The major differences between jet-powered airplanes  and piston-powered airplanes have been addressed in several distinct areas: differences in aerodynamics, systems, and pilot operating  procedures. For airplane-specific information, a pilot should refer to the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane.  

# Ground Safety  

Stepping out on the ramp in the vicinity of jet airplanes requires special caution. There is no propeller to indicate visually whether a  jet engine is running. It is easy to inadvertently stray into danger since, even at idle, jet engines are a threat. Enough air is being  sucked into the intake to pull a nearby person into the fan. The air coming from the exhaust is hot and moving fast enough to blow a  person down.  

Pilots operating jet-powered airplanes should exercise caution during taxi and when adding power to start moving. Adding too much  power can pull damaging debris up off the ground or cause damage well behind the aircraft. Jet blast when taxiing into parking areas  may affect any loose ground equipment.  

# Jet Engine Basics  

A jet engine is a gas turbine with basic cycle of operation; that is, induction, compression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust. Air  passes through   the intake and   enters   the compressor   section,   which    made up   of   a series of   fan   blades or   “stages.”   The first stage,  visible from the front of the engine, is the largest diameter and has the biggest blades. Each subsequent stage contains smaller  diameter and thinner blades of increasing pitch. The compression in each stage raises the air temperature and pressure. The high- pressure hot air enters the combustion chamber where fuel is added. During engine start, igniters set the fuel air mixture on fire, after  which the fire is self-sustaining. The rapidly expanding air flows to the turbine section, which like the compressor section, consists of  a series of fan blade stages. The turbine section extracts a portion of the available energy from the airflow to turn a shaft, which drives  the compressor. The remaining energy causes rapid air expansion in the nozzle of the tail pipe, accelerates the gas to a high velocity,  and produces thrust.  [Figure 16-1]  

![](images/3221531e7845fb94f3afdcaa00cd426ed806e1291d03a1e4eb8577816e2d989a.jpg)

Figure 16-1.  Basic turbojet engine.  

The large first stage design of a turbofan engine, a ducted fan, diverts some of the air around the engine core. This cooler bypass air  produces some of the thrust. The amount of air that bypasses the core compared to the amount compressed for combustion determines  a turbofan’s   bypass   ratio.   In   a turbofan   engine,   the compressor   and   turbine sections   divide into   sub-sections. Each sub-section in the  turbine section connects to a specific sub-section of the compressor section via a split-spool shaft.  [Figure 16-2]  

![](images/5ac26999d3880e0396012efdea8a26ffc88d0c273d97752b9fa058428b3e6bcf.jpg)  
Figure 16-2.  Turbofan engine.  

Air drawn into the engine for the gas generator is further compressed and constitutes the core airflow. While a turbojet engine uses  the entire   gas generator’s   output to   produce   thrust in   the form   of   a high-velocity exhaust gas jet, the lower velocity and cooler bypass  air produces some of the thrust produced by a turbofan engine.  

The turbofan engine design increases the thrust of the jet engine, particularly at lower speeds and altitudes. Although less efficient at  higher altitudes, the turbofan engine increases acceleration, decreases the takeoff roll, improves initial climb performance, and often  has the effect of decreasing fuel consumption.  

# Operating the Jet Engine  

In a jet engine, the amount of fuel injected into the combustion chamber controls thrust. Because most engine control functions are  automatic, the power controls on most turbojet-powered and turbofan-powered airplanes consist of just one thrust lever for each  engine. The thrust lever links to a fuel control and/or electronic engine computer that meters fuel flow based on revolutions per  minute (rpm), internal temperatures, ambient conditions, and other factors.  

Typically in jet airplanes, there are flight deck indications for the rotation speed of each major engine section. Each engine section  rotates at many thousands of rpm. For ease of interpretation, the indications read as percent of rpm rather than actual rpm. Depending  on the make and model, there are usually indications for fuel flow, as well as for gas temperatures and pressures. The associated  engine indications have different names according to their location.  

As in any gas turbine engine, exceeding temperature or rpm limits, even for a few seconds, may result in serious damage to turbine  blades and other components. The pilot should monitor the temperature of turbine gases and rotation speeds as needed. Modern  aircraft are designed to prevent exceedances and alert the pilot of an impending or actual exceedance. Older designs rely more on the  pilot to prevent any exceedances.  

# Setting Power  

When setting power, the pilot normally uses pressure or rpm indications to set maximum allowable thrust. However, the forward  movement of the thrust levers should be stopped for any limitation (e.g., pressure, rpm, or temperature).  

# Thrust to Thrust Lever Relationship  

In a jet engine, thrust output changes much more per increment of throttle movement at high engine speeds. If the  power setting is  already high, it normally takes a small amount of movement to change the power output. This is a significant difference for the pilot  transitioning to jet-powered airplanes. In a situation where significantly more thrust is needed and the jet engine is at low rpm, inching  the thrust lever forward will have little effect. It this situation, the pilot needs to make a smooth and significant thrust lever position  change to increase the power.  

# Variation of Thrust with RPM  

Jets operate most efficiently in the 85 percent to 100 percent range. At idle rpm of approximately 55 percent to 60 percent, they  produce a relatively small amount of thrust. An increase in rpm from 90 to 100 percent may increase thrust by as much as the total  available at 70 percent.  [Figure 16-3]  

![](images/6188ed64f219939d91da8a88e11531e57fb49c9c6a7d6064c58eddc25e910339.jpg)  
Figure 16-3.  Variation of thrust with rpm.  

# Slow Acceleration of the Jet Engine  

Acceleration of a piston engine from idle to full power is relatively rapid. The acceleration on different jet engines can vary  considerably, but it is usually much slower. In some cases, the transition to full power could take up to 10 seconds.  [Figure 16-4]  Pilots should anticipate the need for adding power from low power settings.  

![](images/d5a94b9cb4e5a09856c3e874a49d3ae971555ca7920205fc43bd30040b50e727.jpg)  
Figure 16-4.  Typical jet engine acceleration times.  

# Jet Engine Efficiency  

The efficiency of the jet engine increases in the cold temperatures found at high altitudes. The fuel consumption of jet engines  decreases as the outside air temperature decreases for constant engine rpm and true airspeed (TAS). Thus, by flying at a high altitude,  the airplane operates with improved fuel economy and speed. At high altitudes, engines may be operating close to rpm or temperature  limits, and excess thrust may not be available. Therefore, pilots should accomplish all maneuvering within the limits of available  thrust, stability, and controllability.  

# Absence of Propeller Effects  

The absence of a propeller affects the operation of jet-powered airplanes. Specific effects include the absence of lift from the  propeller slipstream and the absence of propeller drag.  

# Absence of Propeller Slipstream  

A propeller produces thrust by accelerating a large mass of air rearward. With wing-mounted engines, this air passes over a  comparatively large percentage of the wing area. The total lift equals the sum of the lift generated by the wing area not in the wake of  the propeller (as a result of airplane speed) and the lift generated by the wing area influenced by the propeller slipstream. By  increasing or decreasing the speed of the slipstream air, it is possible to increase or decrease the total lift on the wing without  changing airspeed. Since the jet airplane has no propellers, the transitioning pilot should note the following:  

1. Lift is not increased instantly by adding power.  2. The stall speed is not decreased by adding power.  

The lack of ability to produce instant lift in the jet, along with the slow acceleration of jet engines, necessitates a stabilized approach  where landing configuration, constant airspeed, controlled rate of descent, and stable power settings are maintained until over the  threshold of the runway. This allows for better engine response when making minor changes in the approach speed or rate of descent  and improves go-around performance.  

# Absence of Propeller Drag  

When the throttles are closed on a piston-powered airplane, the propellers create significant drag. Airspeed or altitude is immediately  decreased. The effect of reducing power to idle on the jet engine, however, produces no such drag effect. In fact, at an idle power  setting, the jet engine still produces forward thrust. While this can be an advantage in certain descent profiles, it is a handicap when it  is necessary to lose speed quickly. The lack of propeller drag, along with the aerodynamically clean airframe of the jet, are new to  most pilots, and slowing the airplane down is one of the initial problems encountered by pilots transitioning into jets. In level flight at  idle power, it takes about 1 mile to lose 10 knots of airspeed.  

# Speed Margins  

Maximum speeds in jet airplanes are expressed differently and always define the maximum operating speed of the airplane, which is  comparable to the VNE of the piston airplane. These maximum speeds in a jet airplane are referred to as:  

⦁  V MO  —maximum operating speed expressed in terms of knots.  

⦁  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$  —maximum operating speed expressed as a Mach number (the decimal ratio of true airspeed to the      speed of sound).  

Mach number is the ratio of true airspeed to the speed of sound. The speed of sound varies with temperature. At low/warm altitudes,  the speed of sound is so high that an aircraft is limited by indicated airspeed. At high/cold altitudes, the speed of sound is lower so the  aircraft is limited by Mach. To observe both limits   $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$    and   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$  , the pilot of a jet airplane needs both an airspeed indicator and a  Mach indicator. In most jet airplanes, these are combined into a single display for airspeed and Mach number, as appropriate.  

It looks much like a conventional airspeed display with the addition of a "barber pole" that automatically moves so as to indicate the  applicable speed limit at all times.  [Figure 16-5]  

A jet airplane can easily exceed its speed limitations. The handling qualities of a jet may change significantly at speeds higher than  the maximum allowed.  

![](images/4889b783d19b79853a73f0be471fcebe79587569ecbf17fda48c8e9b5357df12.jpg)  
Figure 16-5.  Jet airspeed indicator.  

High-speed airplanes designed for subsonic flight are limited to some Mach number below the speed of sound. Shock waves (and the  adverse effects associated with them) can occur when the airplane speed is substantially below Mach 1.0. The Mach number at which  some portion of the airflow over the wing first equals Mach 1.0 is termed the critical Mach number   $(\mathbf{M}_{\mathrm{CR}})$  .  

There is no particular problem associated with the acceleration of the airflow up to the critical Mach number, the point where Mach  1.0 airflow begins. However, a shock wave is formed at the point where the airflow suddenly returns to subsonic flow. This shock  wave becomes more severe and moves aft on the wing as airflow velocity increases. Eventually, flow separation occurs behind the  well-developed shock wave.  [Figure 16-6]  

![](images/cd942fb53fa3f5c191614f001122d9c965846c10634388063ba281e2e87af931.jpg)  
Figure 16-6.  Transonic flow patterns.  

If airplane speed progresses sufficiently beyond   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$  , the separation of air behind the shock wave may result in severe buffeting and  possible loss   of   control or   “upset.” Because of   the accompanying   changes to   the center   of   lift, the airplane may   exhibit pitch change  tendencies.  

With   increased   speed   and   the   aft   movement   of   the   shock   wave,   the   wing’s   center   of   pressure   moves   aft   causing   the   start   of   a nose- down   tendency   or   “tuck.”   Mach   tuck   develops   gradually,   and   the   condition   should   not   be   allowed   to   progress   to   where   there    no  longer enough elevator authority to prevent entry into a steep, sometimes unrecoverable, dive. An alert pilot should respond to  excessive airspeed, buffeting, or warning devices before the onset of extreme nose-down forces.  

Due to the critical aspects of high-altitude/high-Mach flight, most jet airplanes capable of operating in the Mach ranges use some  form of automated Mach tuck compensation. If the system becomes inoperative, the airplane is typically limited to a reduced  maximum Mach number.  

# Mach Buffet  

Mach buffet arises when airflow separates on the upper surface of a wing behind a shock wave. All other things being equal, shock  wave strength increases as the local airflow speed ahead of the shock wave increases. Mach buffet is a function of the speed of the  airflow over the wing—not necessarily the forward speed of the airplane, and the shock wave strength, rather than a stall, creates the  airflow separation.  

Mach buffet may result from two different conditions in cruise. At high-speed cruise, a shock wave that becomes too strong as the  airflow speeds up over the upper surface causes a buffet. At low-speed cruise, the flow has a greater turn to make to follow the wing's  upper surface. The air speeds up to do that and may exceed Mach 1 over the upper surface.  

The shock wave position is different between the two situations. At high speed and a lower AOA, the shock wave tends to move aft.  So when the flow separates behind the shock, that separated flow acts over a small range of the chord. In some cases, the separated  flow acting on a small surface area may produce a little buzz. At low-speed cruise, the true airspeed is still high, but the shock wave  does not move as far aft as it does in high-speed cruise. The separated flow behind the shock wave acts over a larger portion of the  chord, which leads to a more significant effect on aircraft control.  

The altitude at which an airplane flying at   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$    would experience buffeting with any increase in AOA determines the absolute or  aerodynamic ceiling. This is the altitude where:  

⦁  If an airplane flew any faster, it would exceed   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   leading to high-speed Mach buffet.  ⦁  If an airplane flew any slower, it would require an angle of attack leading to low-speed Mach buffet.  

This region of the airplane’s flight envelope is known as “coffin corner.” Conceivably, a buffet could be the first indication of an  issue at altitude, and pilots should understand the cause of any buffet in order to respond appropriately.  

An increase in load factor (G factor) will raise the low-end buffet speed. For example, a jet airplane flying at 51,000 feet altitude at   $1.0~\mathrm{G}$   and a speed of 0.73 Mach that experiences a 1.4 G load, may encounter low-speed buffet. Consequently, a maximum cruising  flight altitude and speed should be selected, which will allow sufficient margin for maneuvering and turbulence. The pilot should  know   the manufacturer’s   recommended   turbulence   penetration   speed   for   the particular   make and   model airplane.   This   speed   normally  gives the greatest margin between the high-speed and low-speed buffets.  

# Low-Speed Flight  

The jet airplane wing, designed primarily for high-speed flight, has relatively poor low-speed characteristics. As opposed to the  normal piston-powered   airplane,the jet wing has less area relative to the airplane’sweight,a lower aspect ratio(longchord/short  span), and thin airfoil shape—all of which amount to the need for speed to generate enough lift. The swept wing is additionally  penalized at low speeds because its effective lift is proportional to airflow speed that is perpendicular to the leading edge.  

In a typical piston-engine airplane,   $\mathrm{V_{MD}}$    (minimum drag) in the clean configuration is normally at a speed of about   $1.3~\mathrm{V}_{S}$  .  [Figure  16-7]  Flight below  $\mathrm{V_{MD}}$    in a piston-engine airplane is well identified and predictable. In contrast, in a jet airplane, flight in the area of   $\mathrm{V_{MD}}$    (typically 1.5 –  $1.5\;-\;1.6\;\,\mathrm{V_{S}}$  ) does not normally produce any noticeable changes in flying qualities other than a lack of speed  stability—a condition where a decrease in speed leads to an increase in drag, which leads to a further decrease in speed, which creates  the potential for a speed divergence. A pilot who is not aware of a developing speed divergence may find a serious sink rate  developing at a constant power setting, while pitch attitude appears to be normal. The fact that lack of speed stability may lead to a  sinking flightpath, is one of the most important aspects of jet-airplane flying.  

![](images/45b0cb4301b748eea2249d394a6e81ecb0f91843c07705328c5f8f21c473e126.jpg)  
Figure 16-7.  Thrust and power required curves (jet aircraft vs. propeller-driven aircraft).  

# Stalls  

The stalling characteristics of the swept wing jet airplane can vary considerably from those of the normal straight wing airplane. The  greatest difference noticeable to the pilot is the lift developed vs. angle of attack. An increase in angle of attack of the straight wing  produces a substantial and constantly increasing lift vector up to its maximum coefficient of lift, and soon thereafter flow separation  (stall) occurs with a rapid deterioration of lift.  

By contrast, the swept wing produces a much more gradual buildup of lift with a less well-defined maximum coefficient. This less- defined peak also means that a swept wing may not have as dramatic a loss of lift at angles of attack beyond its maximum lift  coefficient. However, these high-lift conditions are accompanied by high drag, which may result in a high rate of descent.  [Figure  16-8]  

![](images/0cf5924a1351dffd299d212b70d8951868001ef48b12d5f15b2e96f1226c8feb.jpg)  
Figure 16-8.  Stall versus angle of attack—swept wing versus straight wing.  

If a simple, straight-wing   airplane’s   airfoil is   swept, a natural tendency   arises that it will stall at the wing   tips   first. This    because the  boundary layer tends to flow spanwise toward the tips.  [Figure 16-9]  The tendency for tip stall allowing the center of lift to move  forward is greatest when wing sweep and taper are combined.  To discourage a swept wing from stalling at the wingtips,  manufacturers modify the wing spanwise with twist, changes in airfoil section, inclusion of vortex generators, or a combination of  those modifications. This helps a pilot retain roll control initially if a stall is entered inadvertently.  

![](images/dff431a8a2e31f2ed9f3c6b83073d4ab59427f0a7b06fbfea0d4efd61a6397e8.jpg)  
Figure 16-9.  Unmodified swept wing stall characteristics.  

Some T-tail configurations are prone to so-called deep stalls where the tail can become immersed in the wing wake at very high  angles of attack and lose effectiveness. Such a situation can be accompanied by a high-rate of descent. Since high angles of attack can  occur at any pitch attitude, even a pitch attitude with the nose below the horizon, it may seem counter intuitive in such a situation to  take the appropriate recovery action, which is to push the nose down even further.  

Deep stalls may be unrecoverable. Fortunately, they are easily avoided as long as published limitations are observed. On those  airplanes susceptible to deep stalls (not all swept or tapered wing airplanes are), sophisticated stall warning systems such as stick  shakers are standard equipment. A stick pusher (if installed), as its name implies, acts to automatically reduce the airplane’s   AOA   before the airplane reaches a dangerous stall condition, or it may aid in recovering the airplane from a stall if an airplane’s   natural  aerodynamic characteristics do so weakly. Pilots should avoid situations that would activate a stick pusher when close to the ground.  

Pilots undergoing training in jet airplanes are taught to recover at the first indication of an impending stall instead of going beyond  those initial cues and into a full stall. Normally, this is indicated by aural stall warning devices, annunciators, or activation of the  airplane’s   stick   shaker.   Stick   shakers   normally   activate around   107   percent of   the actual stall speed.   In   response to   a stall   warning, the  proper action is for the pilot to apply a nose-down input until the stall warning stops (pitch trim may be necessary). Then, the wings  are rolled level, followed by adjusting thrust to return to normal flight. The elapsed time will be small between these actions,  particularly at low altitude where significant available thrust exists. It is important to understand that reducing AOA eliminates the  stall, but added thrust will allow the descent to be stopped once the wing is flying again. Note that airplanes without vortex generators  may stall with little to no buffet.  

At high altitudes the stall recovery technique is the same. A pilot will need to reduce the AOA by lowering the nose until the stall  warning stops. However, after the AOA has been reduced to where the wing is again developing efficient lift, the airplane will still  likely need to accelerate to a desired airspeed. At high altitudes where the available thrust is significantly less than at lower altitudes,  recovery may require significant pitch down to regain airspeed. As such, several thousand feet or more of altitude loss may occur  during the recovery. The above discussion covers most airplanes; however, the stall recovery procedures for a particular make and  model airplane may differ, as recommended by the manufacturer, and are contained in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual for  that airplane.  

# Drag Devices  

Jet airplanes have higher glide ratios than piston-powered airplanes. Due to their low drag design, jets take more time and distance to  descend or reduce speed. Therefore, jet airplanes are often equipped with drag devices, such as spoilers and speed brakes.  

The primary purpose of spoilers is to spoil lift. The most common type of spoiler consists of one or more rectangular plates that lie  flush with the upper surface of each wing. They are installed approximately parallel to the lateral axis of the airplane and are hinged  along the leading edges. When deployed, spoilers deflect up against the relative wind, which interferes with the flow of air about the  wing.  [Figure 16-10]  This both spoils lift and increases drag. Spoilers are usually installed forward of the flaps but not in front of the  ailerons so as not to interfere with roll control. Some aircraft use spoilers to augment roll control.  

![](images/d51bbd21271907cce21766f5f35b2dadde36f63ff1920bd4e733e376dd1ea4fe.jpg)  
Figure 16-10.  Spoilers.  

When   flight and   ground   spoilers   are deployed   after   landing,   most of   the wing’s   lift is   destroyed.   This   action   transfers   the airplane’s   weight to the landing gear so that the wheel brakes are more effective. A secondary beneficial effect of deploying spoilers on landing  is that they create considerable drag, adding to the overall aerodynamic braking.  

The primary purpose of speed brakes is to produce drag. Spoilers may also serve as speed brakes, or they may be panels attached to  the fuselage. Deploying speed brakes results in a rapid decrease in airspeed and/or an increased rate of descent. Typically, speed  brakes can be deployed at any time during flight. There is usually a certain amount of noise and buffeting associated with the use of  speed brakes, along with an obvious penalty in fuel consumption. Pilots can minimize the use of speed brakes with proper descent and  approach planning. Procedures for the use of spoilers and/or speed brakes in various situations are contained in the FAA-approved  AFM for the particular airplane.  

# Thrust Reversers  

Jet airplanes have high kinetic energy during the landing roll because of weight and speed. This energy is difficult to dissipate  because a jet airplane has low drag with the nose-wheel on the ground, and the engines continue to produce forward thrust with the  power levers at idle. While wheel brakes serve as the primary means to stop the airplane, reverse thrust, when available, assists in  deceleration.  

Certain thrust reverser designs effectively reverse the flow of the exhaust gases. The flow does not completely reverse. Typically, the  final path of the exhaust gases is about   $45^{\circ}$   from straight ahead. This, together with the losses from the flow paths, reduces reverse  thrust efficiency. If the pilot uses less than maximum rpm in reverse, the reverse thrust is further reduced.  

Normally, a jet engine has one of two types of thrust reversers: a target reverser or a cascade reverser.  [Figure 16-11]  Target  reversers are simple clamshell doors that swivel from the stowed position at the engine tailpipe to redirect thrust to a more forward  direction.  

#  

![](images/0940030efdce22d63e88dfae9d0cd70b30ebe4ee7d4187c918f6a85fd5c317c3.jpg)  
Figure 16-11.  Thrust reversers.  

Cascade reversers are normally found on turbofan engines and are often designed to reverse only the fan air portion. Blocking doors  in the shroud obstruct forward fan thrust and redirect it through cascade vanes to generate reverse thrust.  

On most installations, the pilot selects reverse thrust with the thrust levers at idle by pulling up the reverse levers to a detent. Doing so  positions the reversing mechanisms for operation but leaves the engines at idle rpm. Further upward and backward movement of the  reverse levers increases engine power. Reverse is canceled by closing the reverse levers to the idle reverse position, then dropping  them fully back to the forward idle position. This last movement selects the stowed position, and the reversers return to the forward  thrust position.  

Reverse thrust is more effective at high speed than at low speed. For maximum reverse thrust efficiency, the pilot should use it as  soon as is prudent after touchdown. The pilot should remember that some airplanes tend to pitch nose-up when reverse is selected on  landing and this effect, particularly when combined with the nose-up pitch effect from the spoilers, can cause the airplane to leave the  ground again momentarily. On these types, the airplane should be firmly on the ground with the nose-wheel down before reverse is  selected. Other types of airplanes have no change in pitch, and reverse idle may be selected after the main gear is down and before the  nose-wheel is down. Since reverse thrust may affect directional control, runway surface conditions (e.g., contamination), factor into  the use of reverse thrust. Specific procedures for reverse thrust operation for a particular airplane/engine combination are contained in  the FAA-approved AFM for that airplane.  

There is a significant difference between reverse pitch on a propeller and reverse thrust from a jet engine. Idle reverse on a propeller  produces a large amount of drag. On a jet engine, however, selecting idle reverse produces very little reverse thrust. In a jet airplane,  the pilot should select reverse, apply reverse thrust as appropriate, and remain within any AFM limitations.  

It is essential that pilots understand not only the normal procedures and limitations of thrust reverser use, but also the procedures for  coping with uncommanded reverse. While thrust reverser systems are designed to prevent unintentional deployment, an  uncommanded or inadvertent deployment of thrust reversers, while airborne, is an emergency. The systems normally contain several  lock systems: one to keep reversers from operating in the air, another to prevent operation with the thrust levers out of the idle detent,  and/or   an   “auto-stow” circuit to   command   reverser   stowage any   time thrust reverser   deployment would   be inappropriate,   such   as  during takeoff and while airborne.  

# Pilot Sensations in Jet Flying  

Pilots transitioning into jets may notice these general sensations:  

1. response differences  2. increased control sensitivity  3. increased tempo of flight  

In some flight conditions, airspeed changes may occur more slowly than in a propeller airplane. At high altitudes, the reduction in  available thrust reduces the ability to accelerate. The long spool-up time required from low throttle settings also may affect  acceleration. Finally, the clean aerodynamic design of a jet can result in more gradual deceleration when thrust is reduced.  

The lack of propeller effects results in less drag at low power settings. Other changes the transitioning pilot should notice include the  lack of effective slipstream over the lifting and control surfaces, and the lack of propeller torque effect.  

Even though moving the power levers has less effect at low power settings, the pilot should change power settings smoothly. To slow  the airplane, the transitioning pilot may also need to learn when to use available drag devices appropriately.  

Transitioning pilots should learn power setting management for different situations. Power settings for desired performance vary  because of significant changes in airplane weight as fuel is consumed. Therefore, the pilot needs to use a variety of cues to achieve  desired performance. For example, airspeed trend information provides feedback for power required.  

Power changes may result in a pitching tendency. These characteristics should be noticed and compensated for.  

The jet airplane will differ regarding pitch tendencies with the lowering of flaps, landing gear, and drag devices. With experience, the  jet airplane pilot will learn to anticipate the pitch change required for a particular operation. Most jet airplanes are equipped with a  thumb operated pitch trim button on the control wheel. The usual method of operating the trim button is to apply several small,  intermittent applications of trim in the direction desired rather than holding the trim button for longer periods of time, which can lead  to overcontrolling.  

The variation of pitch attitudes flown in a jet airplane also results from high thrust, flight characteristics of the low aspect ratio, and  the swept wing. Flight at higher pitch attitudes requires greater reliance on the flight instruments for airplane control since outside  references may be absent. Proficiency in attitude instrument flying, therefore, is essential to successful transition to jet airplane flying.  

Control sensitivity will differ amongst various airplanes. Because of the higher speeds flown, the control surfaces are more effective  and a variation of just a few degrees in pitch attitude in a jet can result in over twice the rate of altitude change that would be  experienced in a slower airplane. The sensitive pitch control in jet airplanes is one of the first flight differences that the pilot may  notice, and the transitioning pilot may have a tendency to overcontrol pitch during initial training flights. Accurate and smooth control  is one of the first techniques the transitioning pilot should master. Rather than gripping the yoke with the hand at high speeds, just  using fingertips will result in smoother control inputs.  

The pilot flying a swept wing jet airplane should understand that it is normal to fly at higher angles of attack. Depending on weight,  density altitude, and available thrust, the pitch angle on takeoff may seem high. It is also not unusual to have a noticeable nose-up  pitch on an approach to a landing.  

# Jet Airplane Takeoff and Climb  

The following information is generic in nature and, since most civilian jet airplanes require a minimum flight crew of two pilots,  assumes a two-pilot crew. If any of the following information conflicts with FAA-approved AFM procedures for a particular airplane,  the AFM procedures take precedence. Also, if any of the following procedures differ from the FAA-approved procedures developed  for use by a specific air operator and/or for use in an FAA-approved training center or pilot school curriculum, the FAA-approved  procedures for that operator and/or training center/pilot school take precedence.  

# V-Speeds  

The following   are speeds   that affect the jet airplane’s   takeoff   performance.   The jet airplane pilot should   understand   how   to   use these  speeds when planning for takeoff.  

⦁  $\mathbf{V}_{S}$  —stalling speed or minimum steady flight speed at which the airplane is controllable.  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{1}}.$  —critical engine failure speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed at which the pilot is to continue  th e takeoff in the event of an engine failure or other serious emergency. At speeds less than   $\mathrm{V}_{1}$  , it is  considered safer to stop the aircraft within the accelerate-stop distance. It is also the minimum speed in the  takeoff, following a failure of the critical engine at VEF, at which the pilot can continue the takeoff and  achieve the required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance.  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{EF}}$  —speed used during certification at which the critical engine is assumed to fail.  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{R}}$  —rotation speed, or speed at which the rotation of the airplane is initiated to takeoff attitude. This speed  cannot be less than  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$    or less than  $1.05\times\mathrm{V_{MCA}}$    (minimum control speed in the air). On a single-engine  takeoff, it also allows for the acceleration to  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$    at the 35-foot height at the end of the runway.  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$  —lift-off speed, or speed at which the airplane first becomes airborne. This is an engineering term      used when the airplane is certificated to meet certain requirements. The pilot takes this speed into      consideration if the AFM lists it.  

⦁  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  —takeoff safety speed, or a referenced airspeed obtained after lift-off at which the required one­ engine-inoperative climb performance can be achieved.  

# Takeoff Roll  

After confirming the runway and position match expectations, the airplane should be aligned in the center of the runway. When  runway length is limited, the brakes should be held while the thrust levers are brought to a power setting specified in the AFM and the  engines allowed to stabilize. The engine instruments should be checked for proper operation before the brakes are released or the  power increased further. This procedure assures symmetrical thrust during the takeoff roll and aids in prevention of overshooting the  desired takeoff thrust setting. After brake release, the power levers should be set to the pre-computed takeoff power setting and  takeoff thrust adjustments made prior to reaching 60 knots. The final engine power adjustments are normally made by the pilot not  flying. Retarding a thrust lever would only be necessary in case an engine exceeds any limitation.  

Takeoff data, including   $\mathrm{V_{1}/V_{R}}$    and   $\mathbf{V}_{2}$    speeds, takeoff power settings, and required field length should be computed prior to each  takeoff. For any make and model without an FMS, the data should be recorded on a takeoff data card. This data is based on airplane  weight, runway length available, runway gradient, field temperature, field barometric pressure, wind, icing conditions, and runway  condition. Both pilots should review the takeoff data entered in an FMS or separately compute the takeoff data and cross-check with  the takeoff data card. If takeoff plans change while taxiing, the pilot or crew should recalculate the takeoff data.

Figure 16-12.  Sample captain’s   briefing.  

If   sufficient   runway   length   is   available,   a “rolling”   takeoff   may   be   made   without   stopping   at the   end   of   the   runway.   Using   this  procedure, as the airplane rolls onto the runway, the thrust levers should be smoothly advanced to the recommended intermediate  power setting and the engines allowed to stabilize, and then proceed as in the static takeoff outlined above. Rolling takeoffs can also  be made from the end of the runway by advancing the thrust levers from idle as the brakes are released.  

During the takeoff roll, the pilot flying should concentrate on directional control of the airplane. This is made somewhat easier  because there is no torque-produced yawing in a jet as there is in a propeller-driven airplane. The airplane should be maintained  exactly on centerline with the wings level. This automatically aids the pilot when contending with an engine failure. If a crosswind  exists, the wings should be kept level by displacing the control wheel into the crosswind. During the takeoff roll, the primary  responsibility of the pilot not flying is to closely monitor the aircraft systems and to call out the proper   $\mathrm{v}$   speeds as directed in the  captain’s   briefing.  

Slight forward pressure should be held on the control column to keep the nose-wheel rolling firmly on the runway. If nose- wheel steering is being utilized, the pilot flying should monitor the nose-wheel steering to about 80 knots (or   $\mathrm{V_{MCG}}$    for the  particular airplane) while the pilot not flying applies the forward pressure. After reaching   $\mathrm{V_{MCG}}$  , the pilot flying should bring his  or her left hand up to the control wheel. The pilot’s other hand should be on the thrust levers until at least   $\mathrm{V_{1}}$    speed is attained.  Although the pilot not flying maintains a check on the engine instruments throughout the takeoff roll, the pilot flying (pilot-in­ command) makes the decision to continue or reject a takeoff for any reason. A decision to reject a takeoff requires immediate  retarding of thrust levers.  

The takeoff and climb-out should be accomplished in accordance with a standard takeoff and departure profile developed for the  particular make and model airplane.  [Figure 16-13]

Figure 16-13.  Sample takeoff and departure profile.  

The pilot not flying should call out   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  . After passing   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$    speed on the takeoff roll, it is no longer mandatory for the pilot flying to  keep a hand on the thrust levers. The point for abort has passed, and both hands may be placed on the control wheel. As the airspeed  approaches   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$  , the control column should be moved to a neutral position. As the pre-computed   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    speed is attained, the pilot not  flying should make the appropriate call-out, and the pilot flying should smoothly rotate the airplane to the appropriate takeoff pitch  attitude.  

# Rejected Takeoff  

Every takeoff could potentially result in a rejected takeoff (RTO) for a variety of reasons: engine failure, fire or smoke, unsuspected  equipment on the runway, bird strike, blown tires, direct instructions from the governing ATC authority, or recognition of a  significant abnormality (split-airspeed indications, activation of a warning horn, etc.).  

Ill-advised rejected takeoff decisions by flight crews and improper pilot technique during the execution of a rejected takeoff  contribute to a majority of takeoff-related commercial aviation accidents worldwide. Statistically, although only 2 percent of rejected  takeoffs are in this category, high-speed aborts above 120 knots account for the vast majority of RTO overrun accidents. A brief  moment of indecision may mean the difference between running out of runway and coming to a safe halt after an aborted takeoff.  

It is paramount to remember that FAA-approved takeoff data for any aircraft is based on aircraft performance demonstrated in ideal  conditions, using a clean, dry runway, and maximum braking (reverse thrust is not used to compute stopping distance). In reality,  stopping performance can be degraded by an array of factors as diversified as:  

⦁  Reduced runway friction (grooved/non-grooved)  ⦁  Mechanical runway contaminants (rubber, oily residue, debris)  ⦁  Natural contaminants (standing water, snow, slush, ice, dust)  ⦁  Wind direction and velocity  ⦁  Low air density  ⦁  Flap configuration  ⦁  Bleed air configuration  ⦁  Underinflated or failing tires  ⦁  Penalizing MEL or CDL items  ⦁  Deficient wheel brakes or RTO auto-brakes  ⦁  Inoperative anti-skid  ⦁  Pilot technique and individual proficiency  

Taking pilot response times into account, the go/no-go decision should be made before   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$    so that deceleration can begin no later than   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  . If braking has not begun by   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  , the decision to continue the takeoff is made by default. Delaying the RTO maneuver by just one  second beyond   $\mathrm{V}_{1}$    increases the speed 4 to 6 knots on average. Knowing that crews require 3 to 7 seconds to identify an impending  RTO and execute the maneuver, it stands to reason that a decision should be made prior to   $\mathrm{V}_{1}$    in order to ensure a successful outcome  of the rejected takeoff. This prompted the FAA to expand on the regulatory definition of   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$    and to introduce a couple of new terms  through the publication of Advisory Circular (AC) 120-62, “Takeoff Safety Training Aid.”  

The expanded definition of   $\mathrm{V}_{1}$    is as follows:  

a.)  $\mathrm{V_{1}}$  —t he speed selected for each tak eoff, based upon approved performance data and specified conditions,          which represents:  1.) The maximum speed by which a rejected takeoff assures that a safe stop can be completed within the         remaining runway or runway and stopway;  2.) The minimum speed which assures that a takeoff can be safely completed within the remaining         runway, or runway and clearway, after failure of the most critical engine at the designated speed; and  3.) The single speed which permits a successful stop or continued takeoff when operating at the         minimum allowable field length for a particular weight.  b.) Minimum  $\mathrm{V_{1}}$  —t he   minimum permissible   $\mathrm{V_{1}}$    speed for the reference conditions from which the        takeoff can be safely completed from a given runway, or runway and clearway, after the critical        engine had failed at the designated speed.  c.) Maximum  $\mathrm{V_{1}}$  —t he maxi mum possible  $\mathrm{V}_{1}$    speed for the reference conditions at which a rejected         takeoff can be initiated and the airplane stopped within the remaining runway, or runway and         stopway.  d.) Reduced  $\mathrm{V_{1}-a\,V_{1}}$    les s than maximum  $\mathrm{V_{1}}$    or the normal   $\mathrm{V_{1}}$  , but more than the minimum   $\mathrm{V_{1}}$  ,        selected to reduce the RTO stopping distance required.  

The main purpose for using a reduced   $\mathbf{V}_{1}$    is to properly adjust the RTO stopping distance in light of the degraded stopping capability  associated with wet or contaminated runways, while adding approximately 2 seconds of recognition time for the crew.  

Most   aircraft   manufacturers   recommend   that   operators   identify   a “low-speed”   regime   (i.e.,   80   knots   and   below)   and   a “high-speed”  regime   (i.e.,   100   knots   and   above)   of   the   takeoff   run.   In   the   “low-speed”   regime,   pilots   should   abort   takeoff   for   any   malfunction   or   abnormality   (actual   or   suspected).   In   the   “high-speed”   regime,   takeoff   should   only   be rejected   because of   catastrophic malfunctions   or life-threatening situations. Pilots should weigh the threat against the risk of overshooting the runway during an RTO maneuver.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be tailored to include a speed call-out during the transition from low-speed to high- speed regime, the timing of which serves to remind pilots of the impending critical window of decision-making, to provide them with  a last opportunity to crosscheck their instruments, to verify their airspeed, and to confirm that adequate takeoff thrust is set, while at  the same time performing   a pilot incapacitation   check   through   the “challenge and   response”   ritual.  

Brakes provide the most effective stopping force, but experience has shown that the initial tendency of a flight crew is to use normal  after-landing braking during a rejected takeoff. Delaying the intervention of the primary deceleration force during an RTO maneuver,  when every second counts, increases stopping distance. Instead of braking after the throttles are retarded and the spoilers are  deployed (normal landing), pilots should apply maximum braking immediately while simultaneously retarding the throttles, with  spoiler extension and thrust reverser deployment following in short sequence. Differential braking applied to maintain directional  control also diminishes the effectiveness of the brakes. A blown tire will eliminate any kind of braking action on that particular tire,  and could also lead to the failure of adjacent tires.  

In order to better assist flight crews in making a split-second go/no-go decision during a high-speed takeoff run, and avoid an  unnecessary high-speed RTO, some commercial aircraft manufacturers have gone as far as inhibiting aural or visual malfunction  warnings of non-critical equipment beyond a preset speed. The purpose is to prevent an overreaction by the crew and a tendency to  select a risky high-speed RTO maneuver over a safer takeoff with a non-critical malfunction. Indeed, the successful outcome of a  rejected takeoff, one that concludes without damage or injury, may be influenced by equipment characteristics.  

In summary, a rejected takeoff should be perceived as an emergency. RTO safety could be vastly improved by:  

⦁  Developing SOPs aiming to advance the expanded FAA definitions of takeoff decision speed and      their practical application, including the use of progressive callouts to identify transition from low-speed       to high-speed regime.  ⦁  Promoting recognition of emergency versus abnormal situations through enhanced CRM training.  ⦁  Encouraging crews to carefully consider factors that may affect or even compromise available performance data.  ⦁  Expanding practical training in the proper use of brakes, throttles, spoilers, and reverse thrust during RTO      demonstrations.  ⦁  Encouraging aircraft manufacturers to eliminate non-critical malfunction warnings during the takeoff roll at      preset speeds.  

# Rotation and Lift-Off  

Rotation and lift-off in a jet airplane requires planning, precision, and a fine control touch. The objective is to initiate the rotation to  takeoff pitch attitude exactly at  $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    so that the airplane accelerates through   $\mathrm{V_{LOF}}$    and attains   $\mathbf{V}_{2}$    speed at 35 feet AGL. Rotation to the  proper takeoff attitude too soon may extend the takeoff roll or cause an early lift-off, which results in a lower rate of climb and a  divergence from the predicted flightpath. A late rotation, on the other hand, results in a longer takeoff roll, exceeding  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$    speed, and a  takeoff and climb path below the predicted path.  

Each airplane has its own specific takeoff pitch attitude that remains constant regardless of weight. The takeoff pitch attitude in a jet  airplane is normally between   $10^{\circ}$   and   $15^{\circ}$   nose up. The rotation to takeoff pitch attitude should be made smoothly but deliberately and  at a constant rate. Depending on the particular airplane, the pilot should plan on a rate of pitch attitude increase of approximately 2.5°  to  $3^{\circ}$   per second.  

In training, it is common for the pilot to overshoot   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    and then overshoot   $\mathbf{V}_{2}$    because the pilot not flying calls for rotation at or just  past   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$  . The pilot flying may visually verify   $\mathrm{V_{R}}$    and then rotate late. If the airplane leaves the ground at or above   $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  , the excess  airspeed may be of little concern on a normal takeoff. However, a delayed rotation can be critical when runway length or obstacle  clearance is limited. On some airplanes, the rapidly increasing airspeed may cause the achieved flightpath to fall below the engine-out  scheduled flightpath unless flying correct speeds. Rotation at the right speed and rate to the right attitude gets the airplane off the  ground at the right speed and within the right distance.  

# Initial Climb  

Once the proper pitch attitude is attained, the pilot should maintain it. Takeoff power is also maintained and the airspeed allowed to  accelerate. Landing gear retraction should be accomplished after a positive rate of climb has been established and confirmed. In some  airplanes gear retraction may temporarily increase the airplane drag while landing gear doors open. Premature gear retraction may  cause the airplane to settle back toward the runway surface. In addition, the vertical speed indicator and the altimeter may not show a  positive climb until the airplane is 35 to 50 feet above the runway due to ground effect.  

The pilot should hold the climb pitch attitude as the airplane accelerates to flap retraction speed. However, the flaps should not be  retracted until obstruction clearance altitude or 400 feet AGL has been passed. Ground effect and landing gear drag reduction result  in rapid acceleration during this phase of the takeoff and climb. Airspeed, altitude, climb rate, attitude, and heading should be  monitored carefully. As the airplane develops a steady climb, longitudinal stick forces can be trimmed out. If making a power  reduction, the pilot should reduce the pitch attitude simultaneously if needed and monitor the airplane airspeed and rate of climb so as  to preclude an inadvertent reduction in desired performance or a descent.  

Speed is limited to 250 KIAS below 10,000 feet MSL in the United States  unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator  (14  CFR part 91, section 91.117(a)). At or above that altitude, the best rate of climb speed is published in the AFM. If asked to increase  rate of climb, increasing pitch slightly will have the desired effect as airspeed bleeds off. If the airplane slows to   $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{MAX}}$  , the  airplane is at its best angle of climb speed, but the rate of climb is less than it was at best rate of climb speed. Trading airspeed for  altitude and a temporary increased rate of climb is referred to as a “zoom climb.” This type of climb provides an increased rate of  climb for a few thousand feet, but it ultimately reduces overall climb performance.  

# Jet Airplane Descent and Approach  

The smoothest and most fuel-efficient descent would be to reduce power to flight idle and slow to   $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{MAX}}$  . In this scenario, the  pilot would descend, level off to decelerate, configure for landing, intercept the final approach, and continue a gradual deceleration  until setting power for a stabilized descent on final. Traffic and time considerations almost always require deviation from this  example, and the typical descent profile has three descent segments with two speed reductions in between.  

# Descent Planning  

For a typical idle power descent, the top of descent (TOD), point A in  figure 16-14 , is determined by altitude, adjusted for wind. Jet  descent profiles normally approximate a 3 degree path, with some time/distance required for deceleration in level flight. While exact  distances will vary, having a descent plan will put the pilot well ahead of the jet and in a better position to monitor the automation.  

![](images/855054bff2575f0f0250812fb0aea20d65a900264e119c32f41529d45829b668.jpg)  

For a straight-in VFR approach to an airport without factoring wind, an estimate for TOD may be calculated by multiplying the  planned descent (in thousands of feet) by 3 and adding any distance needed for speed reductions in level flight (losing about 10 KIAS  per mile when level). If flying at 35,000 feet above airport elevation, a cruise descent would start approximately 120 miles from the  airport (35 times 3, plus about 15 miles for speed reduction, in stages, from cruise speed in this example).  [Figure 16-14]  Normally,  cruise Mach is maintained until increasing air density causes indicated airspeed to increase to the desired descent speed, which  usually occurs just below 30,000 feet. If arriving at point B at 10,000 feet MSL about 40 miles from the airport for deceleration to  250 knots, the pilot would resume a descent about 35 miles from the airport, continuing to 1,500 feet about 15 miles from the runway.  The approach would continue with deceleration and flap extension so as to start the final descent 5 miles from the runway. There, the  pilot extends the landing gear and selects landing flaps by 1,000 feet AGL, and brings the power up by 500 feet AGL to maintain the  appropriate speed for a stabilized approach.  

Variables that affect the TOD calculation include:  

⦁  Head/tail wind component (adjust distance 1 mile for each 10 knots of wind at cruise altitude),  ⦁  Field elevation,  ⦁  Terrain considerations,  ⦁  Runway alignment on arrival,  ⦁  ATC vectors and speed restrictions,  ⦁  Type of approach.  

# Descent Energy Management  

While descending, the pilot can check the progress periodically. Estimating using round numbers keeps the calculation simple.  Passing 25,000 feet should occur at 75 miles out plus or minus corrections; 20,000 feet should be at 60 miles, etc. If there is a  deviation from the desired altitude/distance target, the energy state needs to be adjusted.  

As discussed in Chapter 4,  Using Energy Management to Master Altitude and Airspeed Control , there are two forms of energy in an  airplane: potential energy in the form of altitude, and kinetic energy in the form of speed. In the normal operating regime at speeds  above  $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{MAX}}$  , increasing speed increases total drag, while a decreasing speed will decrease total drag.  

At idle power and at speeds above  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , increasing speed increases the rate of descent. Sample data for a particular make and  model might look like the following:  

⦁  210 KIAS = 1,000 feet per minute  ⦁  250 KIAS = 1,500 feet per minute  ⦁  300 KIAS = 3,000 feet per minute  

The exponential increase in parasite drag at higher speeds has a significant impact on both the rate of descent and the descent angle.  Using the sample numbers, a   $20\%$   increase in airspeed from 210 to 250 knots, results in a  $50\%$   increase in the descent rate. However,  a  $20\%$   increase in airspeed from 250 to 300 knots results in a   $100\%$   increase in the descent rate. Therefore, when at a higher altitude  than desired in a descent, lowering the nose to increase speed will increase the descent angle and get the aircraft back to the desired  path. Conversely, if lower than planned in descent, raising the nose to decrease speed will reduce descent angle until back on the  desired path. Often, just a 10-knot change in speed allows for a smooth and gradual correction.  

If speed adjustment is not an option, power can be added to correct a low-energy state, or the speed brakes used to correct a high- energy state. Numerous power fluctuations or repeated deployment and stowing of speed brakes is an indication of either pilot failure  to adequately plan and/or manage the descent, or a poorly designed arrival procedure.  

If a different descent speed from that planned is used during a descent, an adjustment should be made to the top of descent point. If  ahead of schedule, leaving cruise altitude sooner, setting flight idle, and descending at a slower speed will burn less fuel. Conversely,  if running late and willing to burn some extra fuel, the pilot can leave cruise later and descend at a higher speed. In all cases, the pilot  should check progress during the descent and continue to adjust as necessary.  

Planned descent speed will affect the position of the planned top of descent point.  [Figure 16-15]  In this example, both jets fly past  point   $\mathrm{X}$   at the same cruise speed and altitude with plans to arrive at point Y at 10,000 feet and 250 knots. In both cases, the aircraft  would then be in a position to set up a continued descent. The 250-knot descent requires a few miles for deceleration and gives a  shallower descent path. The 300-knot descent allows staying at altitude longer, descending at a steeper angle, and then leveling off to  slow to 250 knots. The jet that descended at 300 knots arrives first at point Y but burns more fuel. While not depicted, an inefficient  descent plan would start the descent at point X, maintain 300 knots, and require power to maintain that airspeed on a shallow descent  path.  

![](images/8cdf17f0f2159cbf997939fc10d41ad730d32dc04dbbac4da59d623a108dff35.jpg)  
Figure 16-15.  Effect of speed on descent path.  

Descending prior to the planned TOD point will increase time to destination and fuel consumption. When given a descent clearance  prior   to   the planned   TOD,   it is   acceptable to   ask   ATC    the descent can   be done at the pilot’s   discretion.    authorized   to   do so, this  option allows for maintaining speed and altitude until reaching the calculated top of descent point. If an immediate descent is  required, a descent at 1,000 feet per minute is usually acceptable until reaching the desired path. If a descent clearance has not been  received by the planned TOD point, a speed reduction will reduce the airplane's kinetic and total energy while potential energy  remains constant. When the clearance is received, a slightly steeper descent at the onset allows for a desired increase in kinetic energy  at the expense of altitude and an appropriate descent rate such that the airplane follows the steeper desired path with acceptable  energy distribution.  

# Jet Engine Landing  

14 CFR part 25, section 25.125 defines the horizontal distance needed in order to land a jet airplane. The regulation describes the  landing profile as the horizontal distance required to land and come to a complete stop from a point 50 feet above the  landing  surface . Manufacturers determine the landing distance on a dry, level runway at standard temperatures without using thrust  reversers, auto brakes, or auto-land systems as a baseline. The pilot uses the landing weight and environmental conditions to  determine the actual expected landing requirement based on the FAA-approved data in the AFM. As an accepted safety practice,  pilots normally add a   $40\%$   cushion for landing on a dry runway. Dividing the usable runway length by 1.67 should give a number  equal to or greater than the landing distance calculated from AFM data. For a wet runway, the distance should be increased by an  additional   $15\%$  .  [Figure 16-16]  

![](images/177a5db4e3e1cc950a3fbac6de5407de595aa6283f78e6c6fe1a89d6b4e93d4d.jpg)  
Figure 16-16.  FAR landing field length required.  

Simply put, the pilot divides the length of an intended runway by 1.67 or 1.92, as appropriate, to determine the minimum distance that  should be available for landing. With this safety margin, it works out that the minimum dry runway field length should be at least 1.4  times the calculated air and ground distance needed, and the wet runway landing field length should be at least 1.61 times the  calculated air and ground distance needed. Careful flight planning allows a pilot to determine how much load in terms of fuel,  passengers, or cargo can be carried to a particular runway while still maintaining the desired safety margin. Depending on the  destination, the load might need to be limited in order to protect the safety margin when landing. This is often complex, since fuel  load has its own safety implications.  

Certified landing field length requirements are computed for the stop made with speed brakes deployed and maximum wheel braking.  Reverse thrust is not used in establishing the certified landing distances. However, reversers should definitely be used, if available.  

# Landing Speeds  

As in the takeoff planning, there are certain speeds that should be taken into consideration when landing a jet airplane. The speeds are  as follows:  

⦁  $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  —stall speed in the landing configuration.  

⦁  V REF  —1.3 times the stall speed in the landing configuration.  

⦁  Approach climb—the speed that guarantees adequate performance in a go-around situation with an  inoperative engine.  

⦁  Landing climb—the speed that guarantees adequate performance in arresting the descent and making a go- around from the final stages of landing with the airplane in the full landing configuration and maximum  takeoff power available on all engines.  

Pilots may need to perform traffic pattern takeoffs and landings. Pilots should use speeds recommended by the manufacturer while  maneuvering in the traffic pattern prior to slowing to the final approach target speed in relation to   $\mathrm{V_{REF}}$  . The speeds should be  calculated for every landing and posted where they are visible to both pilots.  

The approach and landing sequence in a jet airplane should be accomplished in accordance with an approach and landing profile  developed for the particular airplane.  [Figure 16-17]

Figure 16-17.  Typical approach and landing profile.  

# Significant Differences  

A safe approach in any type of airplane culminates in a particular position, speed, and height over the runway threshold. That final  flight condition is the target window at which the entire approach aims. Propeller-powered airplanes are able to approach that target  from wider angles, greater speed differentials, and a larger variety of glidepath angles. Jet airplanes are not as responsive to power  and course corrections, so the final approach should be more stable, more deliberate, and more constant in order to reach the window  accurately.  

The transitioning pilot should understand that in spite of their impressive performance capabilities, there are many reasons why jet  airplanes are less forgiving than piston-engine airplanes during approaches and when correcting approach errors.  

⦁  There is no propeller slipstream to produce immediate extra lift at constant airspeed. There is no such thing      as salvaging a misjudged glidepath with a sudden burst of power. Added lift can only be achieved by      accelerating the airframe.  ⦁  Propeller slipstream is not available to lower the power-on stall speed. There is virtually no difference      between power-on and power-off stall speed. It is not possible in a jet airplane to jam the thrust levers      forward to avoid a stall.  ⦁  Jet engine response at low rpm is slower. This characteristic requires that the approach be flown at a stable      speed and power setting on final so that sufficient power is available quickly if needed.  ⦁  Jet airplanes are consistently heavier and have faster approach speeds than a comparably sized propeller      airplane. Since greater force is required to overcome momentum for speed changes or course corrections,      the typical jet responds less quickly than the propeller airplane and requires careful planning and stable      conditions throughout the approach.  ⦁  When the speed does increase or decrease, there is little tendency for the jet airplane to re-acquire the      original speed. The pilot needs to make speed adjustments promptly in order to remain on speed.  ⦁  Drag increases faster than lift and produces a high sink rate at low speeds. Jet airplane wings typically have      a large increase in drag in the approach configuration. When a sink rate does develop, the only immediate      remedy is to increase pitch attitude (AOA). Because drag increases faster than lift, that pitch change rapidly      contributes to an even greater sink rate unless a significant amount of power is promptly applied.  

These flying characteristics of jet airplanes make a stabilized approach an absolute necessity.  

# Stabilized Approach  

The performance charts and the limitations contained in the FAA-approved AFM are predicated on momentum values that result from  programmed speeds and weights. Runway length limitations assume an exact 50-foot threshold height at an exact speed of 1.3 times   $\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  . That “window” is critical and is a prime reason for the stabilized approach. Performance figures also assume that once through  the target threshold window, the airplane touches down in a target touchdown zone approximately 1,000 feet down the runway, after  which maximum stopping capability is used.  

The basic elements to the stabilized approach are listed below as follows:  

⦁  The airplane should be in the landing configuration by 1,000 feet AGL in the approach. The landing      gear should be down, landing flaps selected, trim set, and fuel balanced. Ensuring that these tasks      are completed helps keep the number of variables to a minimum during the final approach.  ⦁  The airplane should be on profile before descending below 1,000 feet. Configuration, trim, speed, and      glidepath should be at or near the optimum parameters early in the approach to avoid distractions and      conflicts as the airplane nears the threshold window. An optimum glidepath angle of about  $3^{\circ}$   should be      established and maintained.  ⦁  Indicated airspeed should be between zero and 10 knots above the target airspeed by 500 feet AGL. There      are strong relationships between trim, speed, and power in most jet airplanes, and it is important to stabilize      the speed in order to minimize those other variables.  

⦁  The optimum descent rate is dependent upon ground speed. A rule of thumb is to multiply half of ground      speed by 10. For example, a 130-knot ground speed should result in a (65 times 10) 650 feet per minute      descent rate. Typical descent rates fall between 500 and 700 feet per minute. An excessive vertical speed      may indicate a problem with the approach.  

Every approach should be evaluated at 500 feet. In a typical jet airplane, this is approximately 1 minute from touchdown. If the  approach is not stabilized at that height, a go-around should be initiated.  [Figure 16-18]  

![](images/0dc6e38a59a03d5c539595ea33795316d6b1a6ff758ee44c6b17c7813767b76a.jpg)  
Figure 16-18.  Stabilized approach.  

# Approach Speed  

Any speed deviation on final approach should be detected immediately and corrected. With experience, the pilot is able to detect the  onset of an increasing or decreasing airspeed trend, which normally can be corrected with a small adjustment. It is imperative the pilot  does not allow the airspeed to decrease below  $\mathrm{V_{REF}}$    or a high sink rate can develop. If an increasing sink rate is detected, it should be  countered by increasing the AOA and simultaneously increasing thrust to counter the extra drag. The degree of correction depends on  how much the sink rate needs to be reduced. For small amounts, smooth and gentle, almost anticipatory corrections are sufficient. For  large sink rates, drastic corrective measures would be required that, even if successful, would destabilize the approach.  

A common error in the performance of approaches in jet airplanes is excess approach speed. Excess approach speed carried through  the threshold window and onto the runway increases the minimum stopping distance required by 20–30 feet per knot for a dry runway  and 40–50 feet for a wet runway. Worse yet, the excess speed increases the chances of an extended flare, which increases the distance  to touchdown by approximately 250 feet for each excess knot in speed.  

Proper speed control on final approach is of primary importance. The pilot should anticipate the need for speed adjustment so that  only small adjustments are required, and the airplane arrives at the approach threshold window exactly on speed.  

# Glidepath Control  

The optimum glidepath angle is about   $3^{\circ}$  . On visual approaches, pilots may have a tendency to make flat approaches. A flat approach,  however, increases landing distance and should be avoided. For example, an approach angle of   $2^{\circ}$   instead of a recommended   $3^{\circ}$   adds  500 feet to landing distance.  

A more common error is excessive height over the threshold. This could be the result of an unstable approach or a stable but high  approach. It also may occur during a nonprecision instrument approach where the missed approach point is close to or at the runway  threshold. Regardless of the cause, excessive height over the threshold most likely results in a touchdown beyond the normal aiming  point. An extra 50 feet of height over the threshold adds approximately 1,000 feet to the landing distance. The airplane should arrive  at the approach threshold window exactly on altitude (50 feet above the runway).  

# The Flare  

The flare reduces the approach rate of descent to a more acceptable rate for touchdown. Unlike light airplanes, a jet airplane should  be flown   onto   the runway   rather   than   “held   off” the surface as speed   dissipates. A   jet airplane is   aerodynamically   clean   even   in the  landing configuration, and its engines still produce residual thrust at idle rpm. Holding it off during the flare in an attempt to make a  smooth landing greatly increases landing distance. A firm landing is normal and desirable. A firm landing does not mean a hard  landing, but rather a deliberate or positive landing.  

For most airports, the airplane passes over the end of the runway with the landing gear 30–45 feet above the surface, depending on  the landing flap setting and the location of the touchdown zone. It takes 5–7 seconds from the time the airplane passes the end of the  runway until touchdown. The flare is initiated by increasing the pitch attitude just enough to reduce the sink rate to 100–200 fpm  when the landing gear is approximately 15 feet above the runway surface. In most jet airplanes, this requires a pitch attitude increase  of only 1° to   3°. The thrust is smoothly   reduced    idle as the flare progresses.  

The normal speed bleed off during the time between passing the end of the runway and touchdown is just a few knots. Most of the  decrease occurs during the flare when thrust is reduced. If the flare is extended (held off) while an additional speed is bled off,  hundreds or even thousands of feet of runway may be used up.  [Figure 16-19]  The extended flare also results in additional pitch  attitude, which may lead to a tail strike. It is, therefore, essential to fly the airplane onto the runway at the target touchdown point,  even if the speed is excessive. A deliberate touchdown should be planned and practiced on every flight. A positive touchdown helps  prevent an extended flare.  

![](images/7b5134c90f26bfdacee12bc5cb9317ebd537a0abd59771d8cb30e501c7a7878d.jpg)  
Figure 16-19.  Extended flare.  

Pilots should learn the flare characteristics of each model of airplane they fly. The visual reference cues observed from each airplane  are different because window   geometry   and   visibility   are different. The geometric relationship   between   the pilot’s   eye and   the landing  gear is different for each make and model. It is essential that the flare maneuver be initiated at the proper height—not too high and  not too low.  

Beginning the flare too high or reducing the thrust too early may result in the airplane floating beyond the target touchdown point or  may include a rapid pitch up as the pilot attempts to prevent a high sink rate touchdown. This can lead to a tail strike. The flare that is  initiated too late may result in a hard touchdown.  

Proper thrust management through the flare is also important. In many jet airplanes, the engines produce a noticeable effect on pitch  trim when the thrust setting is changed. A rapid change in the thrust setting requires a quick elevator response. If the thrust levers are  moved to idle too quickly during the flare, the pilot may need to make rapid changes in pitch control. If the thrust levers are moved  more slowly, the elevator input can be more easily coordinated.  

# Touchdown and Rollout  

A proper approach and flare positions the airplane to touch down in the touchdown target zone, which is usually about 1,000 feet  beyond the runway threshold. Once the main wheels have contacted the runway, the pilot should maintain directional control and  initiate the stopping process on the runway that remains in front of the airplane. The runway distance available to stop is longest if the  touchdown was on target. The energy to be dissipated is least if there is no excess speed.  

At the point of touchdown, the airplane represents a very large mass that is moving at a relatively high speed. The large total energy  gets dissipated by the brakes, the aerodynamic drag, and the thrust reversers (if available). The nose-wheel should be lowered onto  the ground immediately after touchdown because a jet airplane decelerates poorly when held in a nose-high attitude, and placing the  nose-wheel tire(s) on the ground assists in maintaining directional control. Lowering the nose gear decreases the wing AOA,  decreasing the lift, placing more load onto the tires, thereby increasing tire-to-ground friction. Landing distance charts for jet  airplanes assume that the nose-wheel is lowered onto the runway within 4 seconds of touchdown.  

There are only three forces available for stopping the airplane: wheel braking, reverse thrust, and aerodynamic braking. Of the three,  the brakes are most effective and therefore the most important stopping force for most landings. When the runway is very slippery,  reverse thrust and drag may be the dominant forces. Both reverse thrust and aerodynamic drag are most effective at high speeds.  Neither is affected by runway surface conditions. Brakes, on the other hand, are most effective at low speed. The landing rollout  distance depends on the touchdown speed, what forces are applied, and when they are applied. The pilot controls the what and when  factors, but the maximum braking force may be limited by tire-to-ground friction.  

The pilot should begin braking as soon after touchdown and wheel spin-up as possible, and smoothly continue the braking until  stopped or a safe taxi speed is reached. However, caution should be used if the airplane is not equipped with a functioning anti-skid  system. In such a case, heavy braking can cause the wheels to lock and the tires to skid.  

Both directional control and braking utilize tire ground friction. They share the maximum friction force the tires can provide.  Increasing either subtracts from the other. Understanding tire ground friction, how runway contamination affects it, and how to use  the friction available to maximum advantage is important to a jet pilot.  

Spoilers should be deployed immediately after touchdown because they are most effective at high speed. Timely deployment of  spoilers increases drag significantly, but more importantly, they spoil much of the lift the wing is creating, thereby causing more of  the weight of the airplane to be loaded onto the wheels. The spoilers increase wheel loading, which increases the tire ground friction  force making the maximum tire braking forces available.  

Like spoilers, thrust reversers are most effective at high speeds and should be deployed quickly after touchdown. However, the pilot  should not command significant reverse thrust until the nose-wheel is on the ground. If the reversers deploy asymmetrically resulting  in an uncontrollable yaw toward the side with more reverse thrust, the pilot needs whatever nose-wheel steering is available to  maintain directional control. When runway length is not a factor, using idle reverse thrust may be adequate.  

# Jet Airplane Systems and Maintenance  

All FAA-certificated jet airplanes are certificated under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 25, which contains  the airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes. The FAA-certificated jet airplane is a highly sophisticated machine with  proven levels of performance and guaranteed safety margins. The jet airplane’s performance and safety margins can only be realized,  however, if the airplane is operated in strict compliance with the procedures and limitations contained in the FAA-approved AFM for  the particular airplane. Furthermore, in accordance with 14 CFR part 91, section 91.213( a ),  a turbine-powered airplane does not  qualify to takeoff with inoperable instruments or equipment installed unless, among other requirements, an approved Minimum  Equipment List (MEL) exists for that aircraft, and the aircraft is operated under all applicable conditions and limitations contained in  the MEL (section 91.213(a)(5)).  

# Minimum Equipment List  

The MEL serves as a reference guide for dispatchers and pilots to determine whether takeoff of an aircraft with inoperative  instruments or equipment is authorized under the provisions of applicable regulatory requirements.  

The   operator   models   the   MEL   after   the   FAA’s   Master   MEL   (MMEL)   for   each   type   of   aircraft   and   the   Administrator   approves   the  MEL   before   its   implementation.   The   MEL   includes   a “General”   section,   comprised   of   definitions,   general   policies,   as well   as  operational procedures for flight crews and maintenance personnel. Each aircraft component addressed in the MEL is listed in an  alphabetical index for quick reference. A table of contents further divides the manual in different chapters, each numbered for its  corresponding aircraft system designation (i.e., the electrical system, also designated as system number 24, would be found in chapter  24 of the MEL).  

Pilots may defer repair of items on those aircraft systems and components allowed by the approved MEL. Per 14 CFR part 91,  section 91.213(a)(3)(ii), an MEL must provide for the operation of the aircraft with the instruments and equipment in an inoperable  condition. If particular items do not allow for safe operation, they do not appear on the MEL and takeoff is not authorized until  the item is adequately repaired or replaced (section 91.213(a)). In cases where repairs may temporarily be deferred, operation or  dispatch of an aircraft whose systems have been impaired is often subject to limitations or other conditional requirements  explicitly stated in the MEL. Such conditional requirements may be of an operational nature, a mechanical nature, or both.  

Mechanical conditions outlined in the MEL may require precautionary pre-flight checks, partial repairs prior to departure, or the  isolation of selected elements of the deficient aircraft system (or related interacting systems), as well as the securing of other system  components to avoid further degradation in flight. The MEL may contain either a step-by-step description of required  partial maintenance actions or a list of numerical references to the Maintenance Procedures Manual (MPM) where each corrective  procedure is explained in detail. Procedures performed to ensure the aircraft can be safely operated are categorized as either  pperations procedures or maintenance procedures. The MEL will denote which by indicating an “O” or an “M” as appropriate.  

If operational and mechanical conditions can be met, an authorized person makes an entry in the aircraft MEL Deferral Record and  issues a temporary placard. This authorizes the operation for a limited time before permanent repairs take place. The placard is  affixed by maintenance personnel or the flight crew onto or next to the instrument or control mechanism to remind the flight crew of  any limitations.  

The MEL only applies while the aircraft sits on the ground awaiting departure or takeoff. It is essentially a dispatching reference tool  used in support of all applicable Federal Aviation Regulations. If dispatchers are not required by the operator’s certificate, flight  crews still need to refer to the MEL before dispatching themselves to ensure that the flight is planned and conducted within  the operating limits set forth in the MEL. Once the aircraft leaves the ground, any mechanical failures should be addressed using  the appropriate checklists and approved AFM, not the MEL. Although a pilot may refer to the MEL for background information  and documentation, actions in flight should be based strictly on instructions provided by the AFM (i.e., Abnormal or  Emergency sections).  

# Configuration Deviation List  

A Configuration Deviation List (CDL) is used in the same manner as an MEL but it differs in that it addresses missing external parts  of the aircraft rather than failing internal systems and their constituent parts. They typically include elements, such as service doors,  power receptacle doors, slat track doors, landing gear doors, APU ram air doors, flaps fairings, nose-wheel spray deflectors, position  light lens covers, slat segment seals, static dischargers, etc.  

# Chapter Summary  

Some of the differences when transitioning from props to jets include:  

⦁  Engine intake suction and exhaust create a ground hazard.  ⦁  There is no propeller-induced lift when power increases.  ⦁  Engine spool up time from low power settings is longer.  ⦁  Swept wing stalls begin at the tips.  ⦁  Higher speeds require smaller and smoother flight control inputs.  ⦁  Descents require more planning and optimally occur at idle power.  ⦁  When descending at speeds above  $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{MAX}}$  , increasing speed increases rate of descent and descent angle.  

There are many considerations for a pilot when transitioning to turbojet-powered airplanes. In addition to the information found in  this chapter and type specific information that will be found in an FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual, a pilot can find basic  aerodynamic information for swept wing jets, considerations for operating at high altitudes, and airplane upset causes and general  recovery procedures in the Airplane Upset Recovery Training Aid, Supplement, pages 1-14, and all of Section 2 found at  www.faa.gov/other_visit/aviation_industry/airline_operators/training/media/ap_upsetrecovery_book.pdf .  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)   Chapter 17: Transition to Light Sport Airplanes (LSA)  

# Introduction  

The   light-sport   aircraft   (LSA)   concept   broadens   the   access   of   flight   to   more people.   LSA   have been   defined   as a simple-to-operate, easy-to-fly   aircraft;   however,   “simple-to-operate”   and   “easy-to-fly”   do   not   negate   the   need   for   proper   and   effective   training.   This   chapter introduces the light-sport category of airplanes and places emphasis on transition to a light-sport airplane.  

Even though light-sport airplane flight may appear simple to an experienced pilot, a transition to a light-sport airplane should include  the same methodical training approach as transitioning into any other airplane. A pilot seeking a transition into light-sport airplane  flying should follow a systematic, structured light-sport airplane training course under the guidance of a competent instructor with  recent experience in the specific training airplane.  

# Light-Sport Aircraft Background  

Several groups were instrumental in the development and success of the LSA concept. These included the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), Light Aircraft Manufacturers Association, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)  International, and countless individuals who promoted the concept since the early 1990s. In 2004, the FAA released a rule that  created a light-sport classification for airplane, gyroplane, lighter-than-air, weight-shift-control, glider, and powered parachute.  [Figure 17-1]  

![](images/2e8ce328468a9f9cc4e3ee6dbee879d2565109b9d722a67f821d44c435f2e845.jpg)  
Figure 17-1.   The LSA   category covers    wide variety of aircraft including:   A)   airplane,   B)   gyroplane,   C)   lighter-than-air,   D)   weight- shift-control, E)   glider, and   F)   powered   parachute.  

The primary concept of the LSA is built around a defined set of standards found in 14 CFR part 1, section 1.1:  

⦁  Powered   (if   powered)   by   single reciprocating   engine.   ⦁  Fixed   landing   gear   (except seaplanes and   gliders).   ⦁  Fixed   pitch   or   ground   adjustable propeller.   ⦁  Maximum   takeoff   weight of   1,320   pounds   for   landplane,   1,430   for   seaplane.   ⦁  Maximum   of   two   occupants.   ⦁  Non-pressurized   cabin.   ⦁  Maximum   speed    level flight at maximum   continuous   power   of   120   knots   calibrated   airspeed     (CAS).   ⦁  Maximum   stall speed   of   45   knots.   [Figure 17-2]  

![](images/706948e373446f60e7dfa0d64791c5944348f3a5f4ee58502f10e52df207cf0e.jpg)  
Figure 17-2.  Light-sport airplane.  

The LSA category includes standard, special, and experimental designations. Some standard airworthiness certificated aircraft (i.e., a  Piper J-2 or J-3) may meet the Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulation (14 CFR) part 1, section 1 definition of LSA. Type  certificated aircraft that continue to meet the section 1.1 definition of LSA may be flown by a pilot who holds a sport pilot certificate  with the appropriate endorsement for the aircraft (14 CFR part 61, section 61.315(a)). The sport pilot certificate is discussed later in  this chapter. Aircraft that are specifically manufactured for the LSA market are included in either the Special (S-LSA) or  Experimental (E-LSA) designations. An approved S-LSA is manufactured in a ready-to-fly condition and an E-LSA is either a kit or  plans-built aircraft based on an approved S-LSA model.  

It is important to note that S-LSAs or E-LSAs are not type certificated by the FAA and are not required to meet any airworthiness  requirements of 14 CFR part 23. Instead, S-LSAs and E-LSAs are designed and manufactured in accordance with ASTM Committee  F-37 Industry Consensus Standards. Therefore, LSA designs are not subjected to the scrutiny, demands, and testing of FAA standard   airworthiness certification. Industry Consensus Standards are intended to be less costly and less restrictive than 14 CFR part 23   certification requirements and, as a result, LSA manufacturers have greater latitude with their designs. ASTM Industry Consensus   Standards were accepted by the FAA in 2005, which established FAA-accepted industry-developed standards for the design and   manufacture of aircraft for the first time.  

ASTM Industry   Consensus   Standards   for   LSA   cover   the following   areas:  

•   Design and performance   •   Required equipment   •   Quality assurance   •   Production acceptance tests   •   Aircraft operating instructions   •   Maintenance and inspection procedures   •   Identification and recording of major repairs and major alterations   •   Continued airworthiness   •   Manufacturer's assembly instructions (E-LSA aircraft)  

Using   the ASTM Industry   Consensus   Standards,   an   LSA   manufacturer   can   design   and   manufacture their   aircraft and   assess   its   compliance   to   the consensus   standards.   The manufacturer   then,   through   evaluation   services offered   by   a designated   airworthiness  representative,   completes the process   by   submitting   the required   paperwork   to   the FAA.   Upon   approval,   an   LSA   manufacturer    permitted    sell ready-to-fly   S-LSA   aircraft.  

# Light-Sport Airplane Synopsis  

•   The airplane must meet the weight, speed, and other criteria listed in 14 CFR part 1, section 1 that   define  an LSA.   •   Airplanes under the S-LSA certification commonly find use in sport and recreation, flight training, and   aircraft rental.   •   E-LSA-certified airplanes may be used for sport and recreation and flight   instruction for the owner of the  airplane. However, E-LSA certification is not the same as Experimental   Amateur-Built aircraft  certification. E-LSA certification is based on an approved S-LSA airplane.   •   FAA policy allows sport pilots with an airplane rating to fly certain airplanes   (i.e., a Piper J-2 or J-3) that   continue to meet the 14 CFR part 1, section 1 LSA definition even though the airplane was originally   issued a standard airworthiness type certificate.   •   No person may operate the aircraft unless it has been registered by its owner, if eligible for registration,   per 14 CFR part 47, section 47.3(b).   •   United States or foreign manufacturers can be authorized.   •   FAA policy allows holders of a sport pilot certificate or higher level pilot certificate (recreational, private,   commercial, or ATP) to pilot sport aircraft.   •   LSAs may be operated by VFR at night if the aircraft is equipped with the instruments and equipment  specified in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.205(c), and if night   operations are allowed by the airplane’s  operating limitations.   However, sport pilots may not fly at   night (14 CFR 61.315(c)(5)).   •   LSAs may be operated between sunset and sunrise by a recreational pilot as the sole occupant of   the aircraft, in accordance with 14 CFR part 61, section 61.101(i)(3)   for the purpose of   obtaining   additional certificates or ratings and while under the supervision of an authorized   instructor and   provided  the flight or surface visibility is at least 5 statute miles.  

# Sport Pilot Certificate  

In addition to the LSA rules, the FAA created a new sport pilot certificate in 2004 that lowered the minimum training time  requirements, in comparison to other pilot certificates, for newly certificated pilots wishing to exercise privileges only in LSA  aircraft. Pilots who hold recreational, private, commercial, or airline transport pilot certificates may pilot light-sport airplanes  provided they possess the appropriate category/class rating and a U.S. driver's license or medical certificate that meets the  requirements for the aircraft displayed in the 14 CFR part 61, section 61.303 table. For example, a commercial pilot rated in airplane  multiengine land and rotorcraft gyroplane is qualified to fly a light-sport gyroplane as pilot in command (PIC) if also holding a  medical certificate or a U.S. driver’s license. However, that pilot is not qualified to act as PIC of a light-sport airplane (sport airplanes  are single-engine) without supervision from an authorized instructor.  

Pilots   holding   higher   level certificates   with   the appropriate category   and   class   ratings   may   fly   LSAs   as long   as the pilot holds   a valid   U.S.   driver’s   license   as evidence   of   medical   eligibility.   However,    the   pilot’s   most   recent   medical certificate   was denied,   revoked,   suspended,   or   withdrawn,   a U.S. driver’s   license is   not sufficient. The pilot would   then   need   to   hold   a valid   FAA   medical certificate   to   fly   an   LSA.  

# Transition Training Considerations  

# Flight Schools  

The LSA category has created new business opportunities due to low fuel usage, reliability, and low maintenance costs. Many owners  and operators of flight schools use S-LSAs for flight instruction and rental.  

When considering a transition to LSA, a pilot should look for a flight school that has experience in LSA instruction and can provide  quality instruction. Personally touring a school and soliciting feedback from other pilots that have transitioned into LSAs may  help find an appropriate school. Some questions to be asked include the following:  

⦁  How many pilots has the flight school transitioned into LSAs and how many LSAs are available for instruction? ⦁  What are the flight school’s rental, insurance, and safety policies?   ⦁  How is maintenance accomplished and by whom?   ⦁  How are records maintained and how is scheduling accomplished?  

# Flight Instructors  

The flight instructor is an important link in a successful LSA transition. A transitioning pilot should choose a flight instructor that has  verifiable experience in LSA instruction. The Sport Pilot rule allows for a Sport Pilot flight instructor certificate, the flight instructor- S.   14 CFR part 61, section 61.413 limits a flight instructor-S to instruction in LSAs—a flight instructor-S cannot give instruction in a   non-LSA airplane (e.g., a Cessna 150). While FAA policy allows a flight instructor certificated as a flight instructor-A to give   instruction in both a light-sport airplane and a non-light-sport airplane, a flight instructor-S with teaching experience in LSA might   provide better instruction than a flight instructor-A who has minimal teaching experience in light-sport airplanes.  

A transitioning LSA pilot should have an opportunity to review the curriculum, syllabus, lesson plans, as well  as  the process for  tracking progress through the training program. Depending on the transitioning pilot’s experience, currency, and type of airplane  typically flown, the flight instructor should make appropriate adjustments to any LSA training curriculum. A suggested LSA  transition training outline is presented:  

⦁  CFR   review   as pertaining    LSAs   and   sport pilots   ⦁ Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) review ⦁  LSA   maintenance   ⦁  LSA   weather   considerations   ⦁  Wake turbulence   avoidance   ⦁  Performance   and   limitations   ⦁  Operation   of   systems   ⦁  Ground   operations   ⦁  Preflight inspection   ⦁  Before takeoff   check   ⦁  Normal and   crosswind   takeoff   and   climb   ⦁  Normal and   crosswind   approach   and   landing   ⦁  Soft-field   takeoff,   climb,   approach,   and   landing   ⦁  Short-field   takeoff,   climb,   approach,   and   landing   ⦁  Go-around/rejected   landing   ⦁  Steep   turns   ⦁  Stalls   and   spin   awareness   ⦁  Emergency   approach   and   landing   ⦁  Systems   and   equipment malfunctions   ⦁  After   landing,   parking,   and   securing  

# LSA Maintenance  

LSAs   should   be treated   with   the same level of   care as any   standard   airworthiness   certificated   airplane.   However,   S-LSAs   have greater   latitude pertaining   to   who   may   conduct maintenance   as compared   to   standard   airworthiness   certificated   airplanes. S-LSAs   may   be  maintained   and   inspected   by:  

1.   An   LSA   Repairman   with   a Maintenance   rating; or,   2.   An   FAA-certificated   Airframe and   Powerplant Mechanic (A&P); or,   3.   As   specified   by   the aircraft manufacturer; or   4.   As   permitted,   owners   performing   limited   maintenance   on   their   S-LSA.  

The airplane maintenance manual includes the specific information for repair and maintenance on inspections, repair, and  authorization for repairs and maintenance. Most often, S-LSA inspections can be signed off by an FAA-certificated A&P or LSA  repairman with a Maintenance rating rather than an A&P with Inspection Authorization (IA); however, the aircraft maintenance  manual provides the procedures to follow. The FAA does not issue Airworthiness Directives (ADs) for S-LSAs or E-LSAs. If an  FAA-certified component is installed on an LSA, the FAA issues any pertaining ADs for that specific component. Manufacturer  safety directives are not distributed by the FAA. S-LSA owners should comply with:  

⦁  Safety   directives (alerts,   bulletins,   and   notifications)   issued   by   the LSA   manufacturer ⦁  ADs if   any   FAA-certificated   components   are installed   ⦁  Safety   alerts   (immediate action)   ⦁  Service bulletins   (recommending   future action)   ⦁  Safety   notifications   (informational)  

S-LSA   compliance   with   maintenance   requirements   provides greater   latitude for   owners   and   operators   of   these airplanes. Because of  the options   in   complying   with   the maintenance   requirements,   pilots   who   are transitioning   to   LSAs   should   understand   how   maintenance    accomplished; who    providing   the maintenance   services; and   verify   that all compliance   requirements   have been   met.  

# Airframe and Systems  

# Construction  

LSAs   may   be constructed   using   wood,   tube and   fabric,   metal,   composite,   or   any   combination   of   materials.   In   general,   the  manufacturer   selects   materials   and   design   to   keep   the airplane lightweight while maintaining   the structural requirements.   Composite  LSAs   tend   to   be sleek   and   modern   looking   with   clean   lines as molding   of   the various   components   allows   designers   great flexibility    shaping   the airframe.   Other   LSAs   are authentic-looking   renditions   of   early   aviation   airplanes with   fabric covering   a framework   of   steel tubes. Of   course,   LSAs   may   be anything   in   between   using   both   metal and   composite construction.   [Figure 17-3]   A   pilot  transitioning   into   LSA   should   understand   the types of   construction   and   the typical concerns   for   each   type of   construction:  

⦁  Steel tube and   fabric—while the techniques of   steel tube and   fabric construction   hails   back    the       early   days   of   aviation,   this   construction   method   has proven    be lightweight, strong,   and       inexpensive to   build   and    maintain.   Advances    fabric technology   continue to   make this   method   of       covering   airframes an   excellent choice.   Fabric can   be limited    its   life span    not properly       maintained.   Fabric should   be free   from   tears,   well-painted   with   little to   no   fading,   and   should   easily       spring   back   when   lightly   pressed.  

⦁  Aluminum—an   aluminum-fabricated   airplane has been   a favorite choice for   decades. Pilots   should       be quite familiar   with   this   type of   construction.   Generally,   airframes tend    be lightly   rounded       structures dotted   with   rivets and   fasteners.   This   construction    easily   inspected   due to   the wide­     spread   experience   with   aluminum   structures. Any   corrosion,   working   rivets, dents,   and   cracks   should       be identified   during   a pilot’s   preflight inspection.  

⦁  Composite—a composite airplane is   principally   made from   structural epoxies and   cloth-like fabrics,       such   as bi-directional and   uni-directional fiberglass   cloths,   and   specialty   cloths   like carbon   fiber.       Airframe components,   such   as wing   and   fuselage halves, are made in   molds   that result in   a sculpted,       mirror-like finish.   Generally,   composite construction   has few   fasteners,   such   as protruding   rivets and       bolts.   Pilots   should   become acquainted   with   inspection   concerns   such   as looking   for   hair-line cracks       and   delamination.

Figure 17-3.   LSA   can   be constructed   using   both   metal and   composites.  

# Engines  

LSAs   use a variety   of   engines that range from   FAA-certificated   to   non-FAA-certificated.   Engine technology   varies significantly   from   conventional air-cooled   to   high   revolutions   per   minute (rpm)/water-cooled   designs.   [Figure 17-4]   These different technologies  present a transitioning   pilot new   training   opportunities   and   challenges. Since   most light-sport airplanes use non-FAA-certificated   engines, a transitioning   pilot should   fully   understand   the engine controls,   procedures, and   limitations.   In   most light-sport airplanes,  engines are water-cooled,   4-cycle,   and   carbureted.   These engines have much   higher   operating   rpm   and   require a gear-box   to   reduce   propeller   rpm   to   the proper   range.   Because of   the higher   engine operating   rpm,   vibration   and   noise signatures are quite different in   most light-sport airplanes when   compared    most standard   type certificated   designs.

# Instrumentation  

In   addition   to   advanced   airframe and   engine technology,   LSAs   often   have advanced   flight and   engine instrumentation.   Installation   of   electronic flight instrumentation   systems   (EFIS)   provides attitude,   airspeed,   altimeter,   vertical speed,   direction,   moving   map,   navigation,   terrain   awareness,   traffic,   weather,   engine data,   etc.,   all on   one or   two   liquid   crystal displays.   [Figure 17-5]   EFIS has  become a cost-effective replacement for   traditional mechanical gyros   and   instruments.   Compared   to   mechanical instrumentation   systems,   EFIS requires almost no   maintenance.   There are tremendous   advantages to   EFIS systems   as long   as the pilot is   correctly   trained   in   their   use.   EFIS systems   can   cause a “heads   down” syndrome and   loss   of   situation   awareness    the pilot is   not trained   to   quickly   and   properly   configure,   access,   program,   and   interpret the information   provided.   If   EFIS is   installed,   transition   training   should   include instruction   in   the use of   the specific EFIS in   the training   airplane.   In   some cases, EFIS manufacturers   or   third   party   products are available for   the pilot to   practice EFIS operations   on   a personal computer   as opposed    learning   their   functions    flight.

# Weather Considerations  

Managing   weather   factors    important for   all aircraft but becomes more significant as the weight of   the airplane decreases.   Smaller,   lighter   weight   airplanes   are   more   easily   affected   by   strong   winds   (especially   crosswinds),   turbulence,   terrain   influences,   and   other   hazardous   conditions.   [Figures    $l7–6$    and   17-7]   LSA   Pilots   should   carefully   consider   any   hazardous   weather   and   effectively   use   an   appropriate   set   of   personal   minimums   to   mitigate   flight   risk.   Some   LSAs   have   a maximum   recommend   wind   velocity   regardless   of   wind   direction.   [Figure 17-8]   While this    not a   limitation,   it would   be prudent to   heed   any   factory   recommendations.

#  

Figure 17-8.  Example of wind limitations that an LSA may have.  

Due   to   an   LSA’s   lighter   weight,   even   greater   distances   from   convective   weather   should   be   considered   the   norm.   While   low-level  winds   that   enter   and   exit   a thunderstorm   should   be   avoided   by   all airplanes,   operations   in   the   vicinity   of   convection   should   not   be  attempted   in   lightweight   airplanes.   Since   it is   not   always   possible   to   fly   in   clear,   calm   air,   pilots   of   lighter   weight   LSAs   should   carefully   manage   all weather-related   risks.   For   example,   some   consideration   should   be   given   to   flight   activity   that   crosses   varying   terrain   boundaries,   such   as grass   or   water   to   hard   surfaces.   Differential   heating   can   cause   lighter   weight   airplanes   to   experience   sinking   and   lifting   to   a greater   degree   than   heavier   airplanes. Careful planning,   knowledge,   experience,   and   an   understanding   of   the  flying   environment assists    mitigating   weather-related   risks.  

# Flight Environment  

The skills used to fly LSAs resemble those pilots use when flying any airplane, but the techniques may vary. This section outlines  areas that are unique to light-sport airplanes. Most skills learned in a standard airworthiness type certificated airplane are transferable   to LSAs; however, since LSAs can vary significantly in performance, equipment, systems, and construction, pilots should seek   competent flight instruction and refer to the airplane’s POH for detailed and specific information prior to flight.  

# Preflight  

The preflight inspection   of   any   airplane is   critical to   mitigating   flight risks.    pilot transitioning   into   an   LSA   should   allow   adequate  time to   become familiar   with   the airplane prior   to   a first flight. First, the pilot and   flight instructor   should   review   the POH and   cover   the airplane’s   limitations,   systems,   performance,   weight and   balance,   normal procedures, emergency   procedures, and   handling   requirements.   [Figure 17-9]  

![](images/5a46213b57543cabd89ed82242e26eebe680753c8d7a77939dcc09a8bd9d35f9.jpg)

# Inside the Airplane  

Transitioning   pilots   find   an   LSA   very   familiar   when   conducting   a preflight inspection; however,   some preflight differences   are worth   pointing   out. For   example,   many   LSAs   do   not have adjustable seats   but rather   adjustable rudder   pedals.  [Figure 17-10]   Often,   LSA   seats   are in   a fixed   position.   LSA   manufacturers   have implemented   various   systems   for   rudder   pedal position   adjustment. Some  manufacturers   use a simple removable pin   while others   use a knob   near   the rudder   pedals to   adjust position.   Shorter   pilots   may   find   that the adjustment range may   not be sufficient, and   an   appropriate seat cushion   may   be needed   to   experience   the proper   range   of   rudder   pedal movement. In   addition,   seats   in   some LSAs   are in   a semi-reclined   position.   The first time a pilot sits    a semi-reclining   seat, it may   seem   somewhat unusual.    pilot should   take time to   get comfortable.  

![](images/9e2f12bc06f494c5a0f9af082c300f2e2130147182cbb37d8b4407f2c03bf868.jpg)  
Figure 17-10.   Adjustment lever   for   the rudder pedal position.  

Transitioning   pilots   should   become familiar   with   the flight and   engine controls.   These may   vary   significantly   from   airplane model to   airplane model.   Some light-sport airplanes use a conventional control stick   while others   use a yoke.   One manufacturer   has combined   the two   types of   controls    what has been   termed   a “stoke.” While this   control may   seem   unique,   it provides a   completely   natural feel  for   flight control.  [Figure 17-11]   Regardless   of   the flight controls,   the pilot should   perform   a full range of   motion   check   of   the flight  controls.   This   means   full forward    full forward   left to   full aft left to   full aft right and   then   full forward   right. Verify   that each   control  surface moves freely   and   smoothly.   On   some LSAs,   aileron   control geometry,    an   attempt to   minimize adverse yaw,   moves ailerons   in   a highly   differential manner; a pilot may   see   very   little “down” aileron   when   compared   to   the “up” aileron.   Pilots   should   always   verify   the direction   of   control surface movement.  

![](images/604628fb673ac24d5b8393b0083fd00c2407a0c408a9a6090e1973ca825dc42b.jpg)  
Figure 17-11.   Stoke   flight control with   conventional engine controls.  

Elevator   trim   on   many   LSAs    electrically   actuated   with   no   mechanical trim   adjustment available.   [Figure 17-12]   Depending   on   the  airplane,   trim   position   indication   may   be displayed   on   the EFIS,   an   LED display,   or   with   a mechanical indicator.   On   electric trim   systems,   as it is   with   any   airplane,   it is   important to   ensure that the trim   position   is   correctly   set prior   to   takeoff.   Because trim   positioning/indicting   systems   vary   widely    light-sport airplanes, pilots   should   fully   understand   not only   how    position   the trim,   but  also   how   to   respond   to   a trim-run-away   condition.   Part of   the preflight inspection   should   include actuating   the trim   switch   in   both   nose-up   and   nose-down   directions,   verifying   that the trim   disconnect (if   equipped)    properly   functioning,   and   then   properly   setting   the takeoff   trim   position.  

![](images/b9bd039624ec0860c8c364c831720ed04a9d825b420905f422a22894adef4f10.jpg)  
Figure 17-12.   Trim control.  

Depending   on   the engine manufacturer,   the engine controls   may   be completely   familiar   to   a transitioning   pilot (throttle, mixture,   and carburetor   heat); however,   some engines have no   mixture control or   carburetor   heat. Instead,   there could   be a throttle, a choke  control, and   carburetor   preheater.  

Regardless,   a pilot should   become familiar   with   the specific engine installed   and   its   operation.   A   transitioning   pilot also   needs   to become comfortable with   the difference   between   conventional engine control knobs   and   those found   in   LSAs.   In   standard   airworthiness   airplanes, control knobs   are reasonably   standardized; however,   LSAs   may   use controls   that are much   larger   or   smaller in   size.  

If   the LSA    equipped   with   an   EFIS,   the manufacturer’s   EFIS Pilot Guide should   be available for   reference.   In   addition,   the airplane  POH likely   has specific EFIS preflight procedures that should   be completed.   These checks   are to   verify   that all internal tests   are  passed,   that no   red   “Xs” are displayed,   and   that appropriate annunciators   are illuminated.   Some systems   have a “reversionary”   mode  where the information   from   one display   can   be sent to   another   display.   For   example,   should   the Primary   Flight Display   (PFD)   fail,   information   can   be routed    the Multi-Function   Display   (MFD).   Not all LSA   EFIS systems   are equipped   with   a MFD or   reversionary   capability,   so   it is   important for   a transitioning   pilot to   understand   the system   and   its   limitations.  

Fuel level in   any   airplane should   be checked   both   visually   and   via the fuel level instrument or   sight gauges. In   LSAs,   fuel level  quantities can   be shown   using   a variety   of   systems.   Some models may   have conventional float activated   indictors   while others   may   have the fuel level display   on   the EFIS with   low-fuel alarm   capability.   It is   not uncommon   for   a light-sport airplane to   have advanced   EFIS technology   for   attitude and   navigation   information,   but have a simple sight gauge for   fuel level indication.   Fuel tank   selection   can   also   vary   from   simple on/off   valves to   a left/right selector.   Fuel starvation   remains   a leading   factor   in   aircraft accidents,   which   should   be a reminder   that when   transitioning   into   a new   airplane,   time spent understanding   the fuel system    time well spent.  

A   ballistic parachute is   a popular   safety   feature on   certain   LSAs.   [Figure 17-13]   These devices have been   shown   to   be well worth   their   cost in   the unlikely   event of   a catastrophic failure or   some other   unsurvivable emergency.   This   system   rockets a parachute into   a  deployed   state such   that the parachute slowly   lowers   the aircraft. The preflight inspections   of   these systems   require a check   of   the  mounts,   safety   pin   and   flag,   and   the activation   handle and   cable.   Because most standard   airworthiness   type certificated   airplanes do   not have these systems   installed,   LSA   training   should   cover   the operation   and   limitations   of   the system.

Figure 17-13.   A   ballistic recovery parachute is    popular   safety feature available on   some LSA.  

# Outside the Airplane  

Transitioning   pilots   should   feel comfortable and   in   a familiar   setting   when   preflighting   the outside of   an   LSA.   Some unique areas   worthy   of   notation   are presented   below.  

Propellers   of   LSAs   may   range from   a conventional metal propeller   to   composite or   wood.   If   a transitioning   pilot is   principally  familiar   with   metal propellers,   time should   be spent with   the LSA   flight instructor   covering   the type of   propeller   installed.   Many   LSA   propellers   are composite and   have a ground   adjustable pitch   adjustment. There may   be more areas   to   check   with   these types of   propellers.   For   example,   on   ground   adjustable propellers,   ensure that the blades are tight against the hub   by   snugly   twisting   the blade  at the root to   verify   that there is   no   rotation   of   the blade at the hub.  

Many   LSAs   are equipped   with   water-cooled   engines. LSAs   may   be tightly   cowled,   which   reduces   drag.   A   liquid-cooled   engine  minimizes the need   for   cylinder   cooling   inlets,   which   further   reduces   drag   and   improves performance.   This   does present a   new   system   for   a transitioning   pilot to   check.   Preflighting   this   system   requires that the radiator,   coolant hoses, and   expansion   tank   are checked   for   condition,   freedom   from   leaks,   and   coolant level requirements.  

Split flaps   may   be used   on   some LSA   designs.   [Figure 17-14]   These flaps   hinge down   from   underneath   the wing   and   inspecting   these  flaps   requires the pilot to   crouch   and   twist low   for   inspection.   A   suitable handheld   mirror   can   facilitate inspection   without   undue  twisting   and   bending.   In   an   attempt to   keep   complexity    a minimum,   flap   control is   typically   a handle that actuates the flaps.    pilot  should   verify   that the flaps   extend   and   retract smoothly.

Figure 17-14.   Split flap.  

# Before Start and Starting Engine  

Once   a pilot has completed   the preflight inspection   of   the LSA,   the pilot should   properly   seat themselves in   the airplane ensuring   that  the rudder   pedals can   be exercised   with   full-range movement without over-reaching.   Seat belts   should   be checked   for   proper   position   and   security.   The pilot should   continue to   use the POH checklists.   Starting   newer   generation   LSA   engines can   be quite simple and   only   require the pull of   the choke and   a twist of   the ignition   switch.    the LSA    equipped   with   a standard   certificated   engine,   starting   procedures are normal and   routine.   The canopy   or   doors   of   an   LSA   may   have quite different latching   mechanisms   than   standard   airworthiness   airplanes. Practice latching   and   unlatching   the doors   or   canopy   to   ensure that understanding   is   complete.   Having   a gull-wing   door   or   sliding   canopy   “pop” open    flight can   become an   emergency    seconds.  

# Taxi  

LSAs   may   have a full-castoring   or   steerable nose-wheel, or   a tailwheel if   equipped   with   conventional gear.   In   order   to   taxi a full­ castoring   nose-wheel equipped   airplane,   the use of   differential brakes is   required.   This   type of   nose-wheel can   require practice to   keep   the airplane on   the centerline while minimizing   brake application   or   damage to   the tires.    the taxi speed    too   slow,   application   of   a brake can   cause the aircraft to   pivot to   a stop,   rather   than   adjust in   direction.   This   results    excessive brake and   tire wear.    the  speed    too   fast, excessive brake wear    likely.  

Transitioning   into   an   LSA   with   conventional gear   (tailwheel)   should   occur   initially   during   no-wind   conditions.   Due to   its   light weight  the airplane,   requires the development of   the proper   flight control responses before operations    any   substantial wind.  

# Takeoff and Climb  

Takeoff   and   climb   performance   of   LSAs   can   be spirited   as they   typically   have a high   horsepower-to-weight ratio   and   accelerate  quickly.   Due to   design   requirements   for   low   stall speeds,   LSAs   typically   have low   rotation   and   climb   speeds   with   impressive climb   rates. Like other   airplanes, the pilot should   be flying   the published   speeds   as given    the airplane’s   POH.   Stick   (yoke or   stoke)   forces   tend   to   be light, which   may   lead   a transitioning   pilot to   initially   over-control. The key    to   relax,   have reasonable patience,   and   input  only   appropriate flight control pressures needed   to   get the required   response.    a transitioning   pilot is   inducing   excessive   control  inputs,   they   should   minimize flight control pressures, set attitudes based   on   outside references,   and   allow   the airplane to   settle.  

During   climbs,   visibility   over   the nose may   be difficult in   some LSAs.   As   always,   it is   important to   properly   clear   the airspace for   traffic and   other   hazards.   Occasionally   lowering   the airplane’s   nose to   get a good   look   out toward   the horizon   is   important for   managing   flight safety.   Shallow   banked   turns    both   directions   of    $10^{\circ}$   to    $20^{\circ}$   also   allow   for   clearing.   Because flight control   pressures  tend   to   be light, it is   easy   to   get in   the habit of   flying   with   a light-sport airplane out of   trim.   This    to   be avoided.   Trim   off   any   flight  control pressures. This   allows   the pilot to   focus   as much   time as possible looking   outside.  

# Cruise  

After   leveling   off   at cruise altitude,   the airplane should   be allowed   to   accelerate to   cruise speed,   reduce   power   to   cruise rpm,   adjust  pitch,   and   then   trim   off   any   flight control pressures.  [Figure 17-15]   The first time a transitioning   pilot sees   cruise rpm   setting   of    $4{,}800~\mathrm{rpm}$    (or   as recommended),   they   may   have a sense that the engine is   turning   too   fast;   however,   remember   that the engine has  gear-reduction   drive and   the propeller    turning   much   slower.    the LSA    equipped   with   a standard   aircraft engine,   rpm   should   be  in   a range comparable to   airplanes the transitioning   pilot is   used   to.   The pilot should   refer   to   the Cruise Checklist to   ensure that the  airplane is   properly   configured.

Figure 17-15.   EFIS   indication   of level cruise flight.  

In   slower   cruise flight, stick   forces   are likely   to   be light; therefore,   correction   to   pitch   and   roll attitudes should   be made with   light  pressures. Excess   pressure used   to   correct a deviation   may   cause a series of   pilot-induced   oscillations.   The pilot should   use fingertip   pressures only   and   not use a wrapped   palm   of   the hand.   Stick   forces   can   change dramatically   as airspeed   changes. For   example,   what  could   be considered   light control pressures at 80   knots   may   become quite stiff   at 100   knots.    flight instructor-S or   flight instructor-A  experienced    the light-sport airplane is   able to   demonstrate this   effect, which    dependent on   the specific model of   LSA.  

LSA   maneuvers   such   as steep   turns,   slow   flight, and   stalls   are typical.   These maneuvers   should   be practiced   as part of   a good   transition   training   program.   Steep   turns   in   LSA   airplanes tend   to   be quite easy   to   perform   with   precision.   Light flight control  pressures, stick   mounted   trim   (if   installed),   and   highly   differential ailerons   (if   part of   the airplane’s   design),   make the maneuvers   seem   simpler   than   in   heavier   airplanes. Basic aerodynamics applies   to   any   airplane.   Factors,   such   as over-banking   tendency,   are still   prevalent and   should   be expected.  

Slow   flight in   LSAs    accomplished   at slower   airspeeds   than   standard   airworthiness   airplanes since   stall speeds   tend    be well below   the 45-knot limit. Practicing   slow   flight demonstrates the unique capability   of   LSAs.   Recovery   from   power-off   stalls   involves  lowering   the nose.   Application   of   power   puts   the airplane back   flying.   However,   a pilot should   understand   that control pressures tend   to   be light, and   an   aggressive forward   movement of   the elevator    generally   not required.   In   addition,   proper   application   of   rudder    compensate for   propeller   forces    required,   and   retraction   of   any   flap   should   be completed   prior   to   reaching   VFE,   which   occurs   quickly    full power   and   nose down   pitch   attitude are maintained.   Power-on   stalls   can   result in   a very   high   nose-up   attitude unless   the  airplane is   adequately   slowed   down   prior   to   the maneuver.   In   addition,   some manufacturers   limit pitch   attitudes to    $30^{\circ}$   during   power- on   stalls.    aggressive pitch   attitudes are coupled   with   uncoordinated   rudder   inputs,   spin   entry    likely    be quick   and   aggressive.  

Depending   on   the LSA   design,   especially   those airplanes which   use control tubes rather   than   wires and   pulleys,   flight in   turbulence   may   couple motion   to   the stick   rather   distinctively.    a transitioning   pilot’s   flight experience    only   with   airplanes that   have control  cables and   pulleys,   the first flight in   turbulence   may   be disconcerting; however,   once   the pilot becomes familiar   with   the control  sensations   induced   by   the turbulence,   it only   becomes another   means   for   the pilot to   feel the airplane.  

# Approach and Landing  

Approach   and   landing   in   an   LSA   is   routine and   comfortable.   Speeds   in   the pattern   tend   to   be in   the 60-knot range.   Flap   limit  airspeeds   tend   to   be lower   in   LSAs   than   standard   airworthiness   airplanes, so   managing   airspeed    important. Light control forces require smooth   application   of   control pressures to   avoid   over-controlling.   Pitch   and   power   are the same in   an   LSA   as in   a standard airworthiness   airplane.  

The weight limit of   light-sport airplanes makes crosswind   landings   an   important subject to   focus   on.   The pilot should   realize that  strong   gusty   crosswind   conditions   may   exceed   the airplane’s   control capability   resulting   in   loss   of   control during   the landing.   Manufacturers   place   a maximum   demonstrated   crosswind   speed   in   the POH,   and   until sufficient practice and   experience    gained   in   the airplane,   a transitioning   pilot should   have personal minimums   that do   not approach   the manufacturer’s   demonstrated   crosswind   speed.   Control application   does not change for   crosswind   technique in   an   LSA.   However,   the LSA’s   weight, slow   landing   speeds,   and   light control forces   can   result in   a pilot making   control deflections   that exceed   those necessary    compensate for   the crosswind.  

# Emergencies  

While an   LSA   is   designed   to   be simple,   a complete knowledge of   its   systems    needed   such   that a transitioning   pilot is   able to respond   properly    any   emergency.  

The airplane’s   POH describes the appropriate responses to   the various   emergency   situations   that may   be encountered.   [Figure 17-16]   Consider   a few   examples:   the EFIS is   displaying   a red   “X” across   the airspeed   tape,   electric trim   runaway,   or   control system   failure.   The pilot should   be able to   respond   to   immediate action   items   from   memory   and   locate emergency   procedures quickly.   In   the  example of   trim   runaway,   the pilot needs   to   quickly   assess   the trim   runaway   condition,   locate and   depress   the trim   disconnect   (if   installed),   or   pull the trim   power   circuit breaker.   Then   depending   on   control forces   required   to   maintain   pitch   attitude,   the   pilot may   need   to   make a no-flap   landing   due to   the flap   pitching   moments.    the EFIS “blanks” out and   POH recovery   procedures do   not reset  the EFIS,   an   LSA   pilot may   have to   be prepared    land   without airspeed,   altitude,   or   vertical speed   information.   An   effective training   program   covers   these emergency   procedures.

# Post-Flight  

After   the   airplane   has   been   shutdown,   tied-down,   and   secured,   the   pilot   should   conduct   a complete   post-flight   inspection.   Any squawks   or   discrepancies   should   be   noted   and   reported   to   maintenance.   Transitioning   pilots   should   insist   on   a training   debriefing where   critique   and   planning   for   the   next   lesson   takes   place.   Documentation   of   the   pilot’s   progress   should   be   noted   in   the   student’s records.  

# Key Points  

LSAs   with   an   open   flight   deck,   easy   build   characteristics,   low   cost,   and   simplicity   of   operation   and   maintenance   tend   to   be   less   aerodynamic   and   incur   more   drag.   When   combined   with   their   low   mass   and   inertia,   these   LSAs   tend   to   decelerate   rapidly   when   power    reduced.   When   attempting   a crosswind   landing   in   a high-drag   LSA,   a rapid   reduction   in   airspeed   prior   to   touchdown   may   result   in   a loss   of   rudder   and/or   aileron   control,   which   may   push   the   aircraft   off   of   the   runway   heading.   To   avoid   loss   of   control,  maintain   airspeed   during   the approach.   When   power    reduced,   it may   be necessary   to   lower   the nose of   the aircraft to   a fairly   low   pitch   attitude in   order    maintain   airspeed.  

If   the pilot makes a power-off   approach   to   landing,   the approach   angle will be high   and   the landing   flare will need   to   be close to   the  ground with minimum float. This is because the aircraft will lose airspeed quickly in the flare and will not float like a more efficiently  designed aircraft. Too low of an airspeed during the landing flare may lead to insufficient energy to arrest the descent and may result  in   a hard   landing.   Maintaining   power   during   the   approach   will   result   in   a reduced   angle   of   attack   and   will   extend   the   landing flare  allowing   more time to   make adjustments   to   the aircraft during   the landing.   Always   remember   that rapid   power   reductions   require an   equally   rapid   reduction    pitch   attitude to   maintain   airspeed.  

In   the event of   an   engine failure in   an   LSA,   quickly   transition   to   the required   nose-down   flight attitude in   order   to   maintain   airspeed.   For   example,    the   aircraft   has   a power-off   glide   angle   of   30   degrees   below   the   horizon,   position   the   aircraft   to   a nose-down   30   degree   attitude as quickly   as possible.   The higher   the pitch   attitude is   when   the engine failure occurs,   the quicker   the aircraft will lose  airspeed   and   the   more   likely   the   aircraft   is   to   stall.   Should   a stall   occur,   decrease   the   aircraft’s   pitch   attitude   rapidly   in   order   to   increase airspeed   to   allow   for   a recovery.   Stalls   that occur   at low   altitudes are especially   dangerous   because the closer   to   the ground   the   stall   occurs,   the   less   time   there   is   to   recover.   For   this   reason,   when   climbing   at a low   altitude,   excessive   pitch   attitude   is   discouraged.  

# Chapter Summary  

LSAs   are   a category   of   small,   lightweight   aircraft   that   may   include   advanced   systems,   such   a parachutes,   EFIS,   and   composite  construction.   While   the transition    not difficult, it does require a properly   designed   transition   training   program   led   by   a competent  flight   instructor-S   or   flight   instructor-A.   Safety    of   utmost   importance   when   it comes   to   any   flight   activity.   In   order   to   properly   assess   the hazards   of   flight and   mitigate flight risk,   a pilot needs    develop   the appropriate knowledge,   risk   management, and   skill, to   effectively   and   safely   pilot an   LSA.  

# Airplane Flying Handbook  (FAA-H-8083-3C)  Chapter 18: Emergency Procedures  

# Introduction  

This chapter describes certain abnormal and emergency situations that may occur in flight. The key to successful management of an  emergency situation, and/or preventing an abnormal situation from progressing into a true emergency, is a thorough familiarity with,  and adherence to, the procedures developed by the airplane manufacturer. The following guidelines are generic and are not meant to  replace   the airplane manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures contained   in   the Federal Aviation   Administration   (FAA)   approved   Airplane Flight Manual and/or   Pilot’s   Operating   Handbook   (AFM/POH).   Rather,   they   are meant to   enhance   the pilot’s   general  knowledge in the area of abnormal and emergency operations. If any of the guidance in this chapter conflicts in any way with the  manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures for   a particular   make and   model airplane,   the manufacturer’s   recommended   procedures take  precedence.  

# Emergency Landings  

This section contains information on emergency landing techniques in small fixed-wing airplanes. The guidelines that are presented  apply to the more adverse terrain conditions for which no practical training is possible. The objective is to instill in the pilot the  knowledge that almost any   terrain   can   be considered   “suitable” for   a survivable crash   landing    the pilot knows   how   to   use the  airplane structure for self-protection and the protection of passengers.  

# Types of Emergency Landings  

The different types of emergency landings are defined as follows:  

⦁  Forced landing—an immediate landing, on or off an airport, necessitated by the inability to continue further      flight. A typical example of which is an airplane forced down by engine failure.  

⦁  Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on or off an airport, when further flight is possible but      inadvisable. Examples of conditions that may call for a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather,      being lost, fuel shortage, and gradually developing engine trouble.  

⦁  Ditching—a forced or precautionary landing on water.  

A precautionary landing, generally, is less hazardous than a forced landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection and  the planning of the approach. In addition, the pilot can use power to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The pilot should  be aware that too many situations calling for a precautionary landing are allowed to develop into immediate forced landings, when the  pilot uses wishful thinking instead of reason, especially when dealing with a self-inflicted predicament. The non-instrument-rated  pilot trapped by weather, or the pilot facing imminent fuel exhaustion who does not give any thought to the feasibility of a  precautionary landing, accepts an extremely hazardous alternative.  

# Psychological Hazards  

There are several factors   that may   interfere with   a pilot’s   ability    act promptly   and   properly   when   faced   with   an   emergency. Some of  these factors are listed below.  

⦁  Reluctance to accept the emergency situation—a pilot who allows the mind to become paralyzed at the      thought that the airplane will be on   the ground    a very   short time,   regardless   of   the pilot’s   actions   or       hopes, is severely handicapped in the handling of the emergency. An unconscious desire to delay the      dreaded moment may lead to such errors as: failure to lower the nose to maintain flying speed, delay in the      selection of the most suitable landing area within reach, and indecision in general. Desperate attempts to      correct whatever went wrong at the expense of airplane control fall into the same category.  

⦁  Undue concern about getting hurt—fear is a vital part of the self-preservation mechanism. However, when      fear leads to panic, we invite that which we want most to avoid. The survival records favor pilots who      maintain their composure and know how to apply the general concepts and procedures that have been      developed through the years. The success of an emergency landing is as much a matter of the mind as of      skills.  

⦁  Desire to save the airplane—the pilot who has been conditioned during training to expect to find a relatively      safe landing area, whenever the flight instructor closed the throttle for a simulated forced landing, may      ignore all basic rules of airmanship to avoid a touchdown in terrain where airplane damage is unavoidable.      Typical consequences are: making a   $180^{\circ}$   turn   back    the runway   when   available altitude is   insufficient;      stretching the glide without regard for minimum control speed in order to reach a more appealing field; and      accepting an approach and touchdown situation that leaves no margin for error. The desire to save the      airplane,   regardless   of   the risks   involved,   may   be influenced   by   two   other   factors: the pilot’s   financial stake        in the airplane and the certainty that an undamaged airplane implies no bodily harm. There are times,      however, when a pilot should be more interested in sacrificing the airplane so that the occupants can safely      walk away from it.  

# Basic Safety Concepts  General  

A pilot who is faced with an emergency landing in terrain that makes extensive airplane damage inevitable should keep in mind that  the avoidance of crash injuries is largely a matter of: (1) keeping the vital structure (cabin area) relatively intact by using dispensable  structure (i.e., wings, landing gear, fuselage bottom) to absorb the violence of the stopping process before it affects the occupants and  (2) avoiding forceful bodily contact with interior structure. Avoiding forcible contact with interior structure is a matter of seat and  body security. Unless the occupant decelerates at the same rate as the surrounding structure, no benefit is realized from its relative  intactness. The occupant is brought to a stop violently in the form of a secondary collision.  

The advantage of sacrificing dispensable structure is demonstrated daily on the highways. A head-on car impact against a tree at 20  miles   per   hour   (mph)   is   less   hazardous   for   a properly   restrained   driver   than   a similar   impact against the driver’s   door.   Accident  experience shows that the extent of crushable structure between the occupants and the principal point of impact on the airplane has a  direct bearing on the severity of the transmitted crash forces and, therefore, on survivability.  

Dispensable airplane structure is not the only available energy absorbing medium in an emergency situation. Vegetation, trees, and  even manmade structures may be used for this purpose. Cultivated fields with dense crops, such as mature corn and grain, are almost  as effective in bringing an airplane to a stop with repairable damage as an emergency arresting device on a runway.  [Figure 18-1]  Brush and small trees provide considerable cushioning and braking effect without destroying the airplane. When dealing with natural  and manmade obstacles with greater strength than the dispensable airplane structure, the pilot should plan the touchdown in such a  manner   that only   nonessential structure is   “used   up” in   the principal slowing-down process.  

![](images/83a752255c17543e0cc5e3ae168eff18ac6ee25ee539b726877050c5ffa61924.jpg)  
Figure 18-1.  Using vegetation to absorb energy.  

The overall severity of a deceleration process is governed by speed (groundspeed) and stopping distance. The most critical of these is  speed; doubling the groundspeed means quadrupling the total destructive energy and vice versa. Even a small change in groundspeed  at touchdown—be it as a result of wind or pilot technique—affects the outcome of a controlled crash. It is important that the actual  touchdown during an emergency landing be made at the lowest possible controllable airspeed, using all available aerodynamic  devices.  

Most pilots instinctively—and correctly—look for the largest available flat and open field for an emergency landing. Actually, very  little stopping distance is required if the speed can be dissipated uniformly; that is, if the deceleration forces can be spread evenly  over the available distance. This concept is designed into the arresting gear of aircraft carriers that provides a nearly constant stopping  force from the moment of hookup.  

The typical light airplane is designed to provide protection in crash landings that expose the occupants to nine times the acceleration  of gravity (9G) in a forward direction. Assuming a uniform 9G deceleration, at 50 mph the required stopping distance is about 9.4  feet. While at 100 mph, the stopping distance is about 37.6 feet—about four times as great.  [Figure 18-2]  Although these figures are  based on an ideal deceleration process, it is interesting to note what can be accomplished in an effectively used short stopping  distance. Understanding the need for a firm but uniform deceleration process in very poor terrain enables the pilot to select  touchdown conditions that spread the breakup of dispensable structure over a short distance, thereby reducing the peak deceleration  of the cabin area.

Figure 18-2.  Stopping distance vs. groundspeed.  

# Attitude and Sink Rate Control  

The most critical and often the most inexcusable error that can be made in the planning and execution of an emergency landing, even  in   ideal terrain,    the loss   of   initiative over   the airplane’s   attitude and   sink   rate at touchdown.   When   the touchdown    made on flat,  open terrain, an excessive nose-low   pitch   attitude brings   the risk   of   “sticking” the nose in   the ground.   Steep   bank   angles just before  touchdown should also be avoided, as they increase the stalling speed and the likelihood of a wingtip strike.  

Since   the airplane’s   vertical component of   velocity    immediately   reduced   to   zero   upon   ground   contact,   it should   be kept well under  control. A flat touchdown at a high sink rate (well in excess of 500 feet per minute (fpm)) on a hard surface can be injurious without  destroying the cabin structure, especially during gear-up landings in low-wing airplanes. A rigid bottom construction of these  airplanes may preclude adequate cushioning by structural deformation. Similar impact conditions may cause structural collapse of the  overhead structure in high-wing airplanes. On soft terrain, an excessive sink rate may cause digging in of the lower nose structure and  severe forward deceleration.  

# Terrain Selection  

A   pilot’s   choice of   emergency   landing   sites    governed   by:  

⦁  The route selected during preflight planning  ⦁  The height above the ground when the emergency occurs  ⦁  Excess airspeed (excess airspeed can be converted into distance and/or altitude)  

The only time the pilot has a very limited choice is during the low and slow portion of the takeoff. However, even under these  conditions, the ability to change the impact heading only a few degrees may ensure a survivable crash.  

If beyond gliding distance of a suitable open area, the pilot should judge the available terrain for its energy absorbing capability. If  the emergency starts at a considerable height above the ground, the pilot should be more concerned about first selecting the desired  general area than a specific spot. Terrain appearances from altitude can be very misleading and considerable altitude may be lost  before the best spot can be pinpointed. For this reason, the pilot should not hesitate to discard the original plan for one that is  obviously better. However, as a general rule, the pilot should not change his or her mind more than once; a well-executed crash  landing in poor terrain can be less hazardous than an uncontrolled touchdown on an established field.  

# Airplane Configuration  

Since flaps improve maneuverability at slow speed, and lower the stalling speed, their use during final approach is recommended  when time and circumstances permit. However, the associated increase in drag and decrease in gliding distance call for caution in the  timing and the extent of their application; premature use of flap and dissipation of altitude may jeopardize an otherwise sound plan.  

A hard and fast rule concerning the position of a retractable landing gear at touchdown cannot be given. In rugged terrain and trees,  or during impacts at high sink rate, an extended gear would definitely have a protective effect on the cabin area. However, this  advantage has to be weighed against the possible side effects of a collapsing gear, such as a ruptured fuel tank. As always, the  manufacturer’s   recommendations   as outlined    the AFM/POH should   be followed.  

When a normal touchdown is assured, and ample stopping distance is available, a gear-up landing on level, but soft terrain or across a  plowed field may result in less airplane damage than a gear-down landing.  [Figure 18-3]  Deactivation   of   the airplane’s   electrical  system before touchdown reduces the likelihood of a post-crash fire.  

However, the battery master switch should not be turned off until the pilot no longer has any need for electrical power to operate vital  airplane systems. Positive airplane control during the final part of the approach has priority over all other considerations, including  airplane configuration and checklist tasks. The pilot should attempt to exploit the power available from an irregularly running engine;  however,   it is   generally   better    switch   the engine and   fuel off   just before touchdown.   This   not only   ensures the pilot’s   initiative over  the situation, but a cooled-down engine reduces the fire hazard considerably.  

# Approach  

When the pilot has time to maneuver, the planning of the approach should be governed by the following three factors:  

⦁  Wind direction and velocity  ⦁  Dimensions and slope of the chosen field  ⦁  Obstacles in the final approach path  

![](images/ff867cdab6a47badd2753c432eb63d356e43751c631e9a3b9e9803abbfa8c749.jpg)  
Figure 18-3.  Intentional gear-up landing.  

These three factors are seldom compatible. When compromises have to be made, the pilot should aim for a wind/obstacle/terrain  combination that permits a final approach with some margin for error in judgment or technique. A pilot who overestimates the gliding  range may be tempted to stretch the glide across obstacles in the approach path. For this reason, it is sometimes better to plan the  approach over an unobstructed area, regardless of wind direction. Experience shows that a collision with obstacles at the end of a  ground roll or slide is much less hazardous than striking an obstacle at flying speed before the touchdown point is reached.  

# Terrain Types  

Since an emergency landing on suitable terrain resembles a situation in which the pilot should be familiar through training, only the  more unusual situations are discussed.  

# Confined Areas  

The natural preference to set the airplane down on the ground should not lead to the selection of an open spot between trees or  obstacles where the ground cannot be reached without making a steep descent.  

Once the intended touchdown point is reached, and the remaining open and unobstructed space is very limited, it may be better to  force the airplane down on the ground than to delay touchdown until it stalls (settles). An airplane decelerates faster after it is on the  ground than while airborne. Thought may also be given to the desirability of ground-looping or retracting the landing gear in certain  conditions.  

A river or creek can be an inviting alternative in otherwise rugged terrain. The pilot should ensure that the water or creek bed can be  reached without snagging the wings. The same concept applies to road landings with one additional reason for caution: manmade  obstacles on either side of a road may not be visible until the final portion of the approach.  

When planning the approach across a road, it should be remembered that most highways and even rural dirt roads are paralleled by  power or telephone lines. Only a sharp lookout for the supporting structures or poles may provide timely warning.  

# Trees (Forest)  

Although a tree landing is not an attractive prospect, the following general guidelines help to make the experience survivable.  

⦁  Use the normal landing configuration (full flaps, gear down).  

⦁  Keep the groundspeed low by heading into the wind.  

⦁  Make contact at minimum   indicated   airspeed,   but not below   stall speed,   and   “hang” the airplane in   the tree   branches in a nose-high landing attitude. Involving the underside of the fuselage and both wings in the initial  tree contact provides a more even and positive cushioning effect, while preventing penetration of the  windshield.  [Figure 18-4]  

⦁  Avoid direct contact of the fuselage with heavy tree trunks.  

⦁  Low, closely spaced trees with wide, dense crowns (branches) close to the ground are much better than tall  trees with thin tops; the latter allow too much free fall height (a free fall from 75 feet results in an impact speed  of about 40 knots, or about 4,000 fpm).  

⦁  Ideally, initial tree contact should be symmetrical; that is, both wings should meet equal resistance in the tree  branches. This distribution of the load helps to maintain proper airplane attitude. It may also preclude the loss  of one wing, which invariably leads to a more rapid and less predictable descent to the ground.  

⦁  If heavy tree trunk contact is unavoidable once the airplane is on the ground, it is best to involve both wings  simultaneously by directing the airplane between two properly spaced trees. Do not attempt this maneuver,  however, while still airborne.  

![](images/c42eeccb81050f4aaa1caa81004b3178463063c80f39d7f827d4663d0a0f7b35.jpg)  
Figure 18-4.  Tree landing.  

# Water (Ditching) and Snow  

A well-executed water landing normally involves less deceleration violence than a poor tree landing or a touchdown on extremely  rough terrain. Also, an airplane that is ditched at minimum speed and in a normal landing attitude does not immediately sink upon  touchdown. Intact wings and fuel tanks (especially when empty) provide floatation for at least several minutes, even if the cabin may  be just below the water line in a high-wing airplane.  

Loss of depth perception may occur when landing on a wide expanse of smooth water with the risk of flying into the water or stalling  in from excessive altitude. To avoid this hazard, the airplane should be “dragged in” when possible. Use no more than intermediate  flaps on low-wing airplanes. The water resistance of fully extended flaps may result in asymmetrical flap failure and slowing of the  airplane. Keep a retractable gear up unless the AFM/POH advises otherwise.  

A landing in snow should be executed like a ditching, in the same configuration and with the same regard for loss of depth perception  (white out) in reduced visibility and on wide-open terrain.  

# Engine Failure After Takeoff (Single-Engine)  

A number of variables and pilot actions factor into a successful emergency landing shortly after takeoff. When an engine failure  occurs during the initial climb,   the pilot should lower the nose of the airplane and establish the proper glide attitude. What   happens  next if the engine does not restart? Does the pilot select a field directly ahead (or slightly to the side of the takeoff path) or should the  pilot turn back toward the point of departure? There's not much time to decide and a lot to consider.  

Continuing straight ahead or making a slight turn gives the pilot time to establish a safe landing attitude, and the landing occurs under  control and as slowly as possible (assuming a takeoff made into a headwind). This minimizes the risk of injury and usually represents  the option with the lowest risk—i.e. the safest option. Turning back requires a more complex analysis and consideration of risk. At  some urban airports, there may be numerous hazards in the departure path. In that case, the pilot might turn back, but only if certain  the airplane can reach the field from its current position and the pilot has trained and practiced the turn back maneuver.  

Turning back to an airport after a low-altitude engine failure, also known as “the impossible turn,” presents many challenges, and a  pilot who attempts to turn back without due consideration and training will need considerable luck to prevent disaster. If the airplane  strikes the ground during the turn, cartwheeling could occur. If the pilot does not lower the nose sufficiently during the turn, an  accelerated stall and fatal crash may occur. Even after executing a successful turn, a return to the airport often results in a downwind  approach. The increased groundspeed could rush a pilot not properly trained for landing downwind. The increased groundspeed and  associated increase in kinetic energy also raise the likelihood of serious injury if unable to make the field.  

If considering a turn back to the runway following an engine failure on takeoff, the pilot should know the expected altitude loss  during the turn for the specific make and model airplane as well as whether the airplane can physically glide back to the field after  executing the turn. Traditionally, the FAA has given the following example. An airplane has taken off and climbed to an altitude of  300 feet above ground level (AGL) when the engine fails.  [Figure 18-5]  After a typical 4-second reaction time, the pilot elects to  turn back to the runway. Using a standard rate (  $3^{\circ}$   change in direction per second) turn, it takes 1 minute to turn   $180^{\circ}$  . At a glide  speed of 65 knots, the radius of the turn is 2,100 feet, so at the completion of the turn, the airplane is 4,200 feet to one side of the  runway. The pilot needs to turn another   $45^{\circ}$   to head the airplane toward the runway. By this time, the total change in direction  is   $225^{\circ}$   equating to 75 seconds plus the 4-second reaction time. If the airplane in a power-off glide descends at approximately 1,000  fpm, it has descended 1,316, feet placing it 1,016 feet below the runway.  

The preceding example illustrates why a turn back,   if attempted,   requires    turn   with    higher   bank   angle.   A standard rate or  shallow turn consumes too much time, requires too much distance,   and generates an unacceptable solution.  

Training   for a turn back includes practicing turns in both directions at a safe altitude in the make and model flown after simulating an  engine   failure   from    climb.   Practice   should   result   in   consistent   altitude   loss   and   the   ability   to   avoid   an   accelerated   stall   when  executing    gliding   steep   turn.   Pilots   should   be   alert   for   and   respond   appropriately   to   any   stall   warning   and   reduce   wing   loading  during   the   turn   as   necessary.   There   will   be   some   observed   variation   in   altitude   loss   during   training.   The   pilot   should   anticipate   that  during an actual emergency, the expected   altitude loss could end up at the high end of the range observed while practicing. Success in  training involves the demonstrated ability to   evaluate the effect of climb performance of the airplane, determine the better direction to  turn back (usually   into a crosswind), predict the altitude above ground after the turn, know the distance to the landing zone, and know  if   the   glide   performance   of   the   airplane   will   allow   the   pilot   to   make   the   field.   Some   airplanes   cannot   usually   make   the   return  successfully, some can   make the return under certain conditions, and some can usually return. The pilot should not attempt a turn   back  unless a successful turn back will result.  

![](images/7e19c7ba0f06b714251b1619414a7b269f50c78a363dcbe8f7c243fc7d4fa5c2.jpg)  
Figure 18-5.  Turning back to the runway after engine failure.  

A turn back to the departure runway may require more than a   $180^{\circ}$   change in direction. There could also be cases where turning back  results in overshooting the runway, and the pilot needs to sense the aiming point within seconds after completing a turn back and make  any necessary adjustments to achieve the best possible outcome. A turn back at low altitudes presents an unacceptable risk for student  pilots, low-time pilots, untrained pilots, pilots without adequate proficiency, and pilots flying airplanes with insufficient glide  performance to return to the field. However, experienced pilots interested in knowing when and how to make an emergency turn back  after takeoff should use the services of an authorized flight instructor who can explain and demonstrate the practicality (or  impracticality) of “the impossible turn” in the specific make and model used during training.  

# Emergency Descents  

An emergency descent is a maneuver for descending as rapidly as possible to a lower altitude or to the ground for an emergency  landing.  [Figure 18-6]  The need for this maneuver may result from an uncontrollable fire, a sudden loss of cabin pressurization, or  any other situation demanding an immediate and rapid descent. The objective is to descend the airplane as soon and as rapidly as  possible while not exceeding any structural limitations of the airplane. Simulated emergency descents should be made in a turn to  check for other air traffic below and to look around for a possible emergency landing area. A radio call announcing descent  intentions may be appropriate to alert other aircraft in the area. When initiating the descent, a bank of approximately 30 to   $45^{\circ}$    should be established to maintain positive load factors (G forces) on the airplane.  

Emergency descent training should be performed as recommended by the manufacturer, including the configuration and airspeeds.  Except when prohibited by the manufacturer, the power should be reduced to idle, and the propeller control (if equipped) should  be placed in the low pitch (or high revolutions per minute (rpm)) position. This allows the propeller to act as an aerodynamic brake  to help prevent an excessive airspeed buildup during the descent. The landing gear and flaps should be extended as recommended by  the manufacturer. This provides maximum drag so that the descent can be made as rapidly as possible, without excessive airspeed.  The pilot should not allow the airplane’s airspeed to pass the never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  , the maximum landing gear extended  speed   $\mathrm{(V_{LE})}$  , or the maximum flap extended speed   $\left(\mathrm{V_{FE}}\right)$  , as applicable. In the case of an engine fire, a high airspeed descent could  blow out the fire. However, the weakening of the airplane structure is a major concern and descent at low airspeed would place less  stress on the airplane. If the descent is conducted in turbulent conditions, the pilot also needs to comply with the design  maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$   limitations. The descent should be made at the maximum allowable airspeed consistent with the procedure  used. This provides increased drag and a high rate of descent. The recovery from an emergency descent should be initiated at a  high enough altitude to ensure a safe recovery back to level flight or a precautionary landing.  

![](images/8291b1527dd5663f4cfcc27512fbd742d44d8fc14700fe3607fb93f61518b53d.jpg)  
Figure 18-6.  Emergency descent.  

When the descent is established and stabilized during training and practice, the descent should be terminated. In airplanes with piston  engines, prolonged practice of emergency descents should be avoided to prevent excessive cooling of the engine cylinders.  

# In-Flight Fire  

A fire in-flight demands immediate and decisive action. The pilot should be familiar with the procedures outlined to meet this  emergency contained in the AFM/POH for the particular airplane. For the purposes of this handbook, in-flight fires are classified as  in-flight engine fires, electrical fires, and cabin fires.  

# Engine Fire  

An in-flight engine compartment fire is usually caused by a failure that allows a flammable substance, such as fuel, oil, or hydraulic  fluid, to come in contact with a hot surface. This may be caused by a mechanical failure of the engine itself, an engine-driven  accessory, a defective induction or exhaust system, or a broken line. Engine compartment fires may also result from maintenance  errors, such as improperly installed/fastened lines and/or fittings resulting in leaks.  

Engine compartment fires can be indicated by smoke and/or flames coming from the engine cowling area. They can also be indicated  by discoloration, bubbling, and/or melting of the engine cowling skin in cases where flames and/or smoke are not visible to the pilot.  By the time a pilot becomes aware of an in-flight engine compartment fire, it usually is well developed. Unless the airplane  manufacturer directs otherwise in the AFM/POH, the first step on discovering a fire should be to shut off the fuel supply to the engine  by placing the mixture control in the idle cut off position and the fuel selector shutoff valve to the OFF position. The ignition switch  should be left ON in order to use up the fuel that remains in the fuel lines and components between the fuel selector/shutoff valve and  the engine. This procedure may starve the engine compartment of fuel and cause the fire to die naturally. If the flames are snuffed out,  no attempt should be made to restart the engine.  

If the engine compartment fire is oil-fed, as evidenced by thick black smoke, as opposed to a fuel-fed fire, which produces bright  orange flames, the pilot should consider stopping the propeller rotation by feathering or other means, such as (with constant-speed  propellers) placing the pitch control lever to the minimum rpm position and raising the nose to reduce airspeed until the propeller  stops rotating. This procedure stops an engine-driven oil (or hydraulic) pump from continuing to pump the flammable fluid that is  feeding the fire.  

Some light airplane emergency checklists direct the pilot to shut off the electrical master switch. However, the pilot should consider  that unless the fire is electrical in nature, or a crash landing is imminent, deactivating the electrical system prevents the use of panel  radios for transmitting distress messages and also causes air traffic control (ATC) to lose transponder returns.  

Pilots of powerless single-engine airplanes are left with no choice but to make a forced landing. Pilots of twin-engine airplanes may  elect to continue the flight to the nearest airport. However, consideration should be given to the possibility that a wing could be  seriously impaired and lead to structural failure. Even a brief but intense fire could cause dangerous structural damage. In some cases,  the fire could continue to burn under the wing (or engine cowling in the case of a single- engine airplane) out of view of the pilot.  Engine compartment fires that appear to have been extinguished have been known to rekindle with changes in airflow pattern and  airspeed.  

The pilot should   be familiar   with   the airplane’s   emergency   descent procedures. The pilot should   also   bear    mind   the following:  

⦁  The airplane may be severely structurally damaged to the point that its ability to remain under control could  be lost at any moment.  ⦁  The airplane may still be on fire and susceptible to explosion.  ⦁  The airplane is expendable and the only thing that matters is the safety of those on board.  

# Electrical Fires  

The initial indication of an electrical fire is usually the distinct odor of burning insulation. Once an electrical fire is detected, the pilot  should attempt to identify the faulty circuit by checking circuit breakers, instruments, avionics, and lights. If the faulty circuit cannot  be readily detected and isolated, and flight conditions permit, the battery master switch and alternator/generator switches should be  turned off to remove the possible source of the fire. However, any materials that have been ignited may continue to burn.  

If electrical power is absolutely essential  for the flight, an attempt may be made to identify and isolate the faulty circuit by:  

1. Turning the electrical master switch OFF.  2. Turning all individual electrical switches OFF.  3. Turning the master switch back ON.  4. Selecting electrical switches that were ON before the fire indication one at a time, permitting a short time  lapse after each switch is turned on to check for signs of odor, smoke, or sparks.  

This procedure, however, has the effect of recreating the original problem. The most prudent course of action is to land as soon as  possible.  

# Cabin Fire  

Cabin fires generally result from one of three sources: (1) careless smoking on the part of the pilot and/or passengers; (2) electrical  system malfunctions; or (3) heating system malfunctions. A fire in the cabin presents the pilot with two immediate demands: attacking  the fire and getting the airplane safely on the ground as quickly as possible. A fire or smoke in the cabin should be controlled by  identifying and shutting down the faulty system. In many cases, smoke may be removed from the cabin by opening the cabin air vents.  This should be done only after the fire extinguisher (if available) is used. Then the cabin air control can be opened to purge the cabin  of both smoke and fumes. If smoke increases in intensity when the cabin air vents are opened, they should be immediately closed.  This indicates a possible fire in the heating system, nose compartment baggage area (if so equipped), or that the increase in airflow is  feeding the fire.  

On pressurized airplanes, the pressurization air system removes smoke from the cabin; however, if the smoke is intense, it may be  necessary to either depressurize at altitude, if oxygen is available for all occupants, or execute an emergency descent.  

In unpressurized single-engine and light twin-engine airplanes, the pilot can attempt to expel the smoke from the cabin by opening the  foul weather windows. These windows should be closed immediately if the fire becomes more intense. If the smoke is severe, the  passengers and crew should use oxygen masks if available, and the pilot should initiate an immediate descent. The pilot should also  be aware that on some airplanes, lowering the landing gear and/or wing flaps can aggravate a cabin smoke problem.  

# Flight Control Malfunction/Failure  

# Total Flap Failure  

The inability to extend the wing flaps necessitates a no-flap approach and landing. In light airplanes, a no-flap approach and landing  is not particularly difficult or dangerous. However, there are certain factors that should be considered in the execution of this  maneuver. A no-flap landing requires substantially more runway than normal. The increase in required landing distance could be as  much as 50 percent.  

When flying in the traffic pattern with the wing flaps retracted, the airplane should be flown in a relatively nose-high attitude to  maintain altitude, as compared to flight with flaps extended. Losing altitude can be more of a problem without the benefit of the drag  normally provided by flaps. A wider, longer traffic pattern may be required in order to avoid the necessity of diving to lose altitude  and consequently building up excessive airspeed.  

On final approach, a nose-high attitude can make it difficult to see the runway. This situation, if not anticipated, can result in serious  errors in judgment of height and distance. Approaching the runway in a relatively nose-high attitude can also cause the perception that  the airplane is close to a stall. This may cause the pilot to lower the nose abruptly and risk touching down on the nose-wheel.  

With the flaps retracted and the power reduced for landing, the airplane is slightly less stable in the pitch and roll axes. Without flaps,  the airplane tends to float considerably during roundout. The pilot should avoid the temptation to force the airplane onto the runway  at an excessively high speed. Neither should the pilot flare excessively because without flaps, this might cause the tail to strike the  runway.  

# Asymmetric (Split) Flap  

An   asymmetric “split” flap   situation    one in   which   one flap   deploys   or   retracts   while the other   remains   in   position.   The problem is  indicated by a pronounced roll toward the wing with the least flap deflection when wing flaps are extended/retracted.  

The roll encountered in a split flap situation is countered with opposite aileron. The yaw caused by the additional drag created by the  extended flap requires substantial opposite rudder resulting in a cross-control condition. Almost full aileron may be required to  maintain a wings-level attitude, especially at the reduced airspeed necessary for approach and landing. The pilot should not attempt to  land with a crosswind from the side of the deployed flap because the additional roll control required to counteract the crosswind may  not be available.  

The approach to landing with a split flap condition should be flown at a higher than normal airspeed. The pilot should not risk an  asymmetric stall and subsequent loss of control by flaring excessively. Rather, the airplane should be flown onto the runway so that  the touchdown occurs at an airspeed consistent with a safe margin above flaps-up stall speed.  

# Loss of Elevator Control  

In   many   airplanes, the elevator    controlled   by   two   cables:   a “down” cable and   an   “up” cable.   Normally,   a break   or   disconnect in  only one of these cables does not result in a total loss of elevator control. In most airplanes, a failed cable results in a partial loss of  pitch   control. In   the failure of   the “up” elevator   cable (the “down” elevator   being   intact and   functional),   the control yoke moves aft  easily but produces no response. Forward yoke movement, however, beyond the neutral position produces a nose-down attitude.  Conversely,   a failure of   the “down” elevator   cable,   forward   movement of   the control yoke produces   no   effect. The pilot, however, has  partial control of pitch attitude with aft movement.  

When experiencing a loss of up-elevator control, the pilot can retain pitch control by:  

⦁  Applying considerable nose-up trim  ⦁  Pushing the control yoke forward to attain and maintain desired attitude  ⦁  Increasing forward pressure to lower the nose and relaxing forward pressure to raise the nose  ⦁  Releasing forward pressure to flare for landing  

When experiencing a loss of down-elevator control, the pilot can retain pitch control by:  

⦁  Applying considerable nose-down trim  ⦁  Pulling the control yoke aft to attain and maintain attitude  ⦁  Releasing back pressure to lower the nose and increasing back pressure to raise the nose  ⦁  Increasing back pressure to flare for landing  

Trim mechanisms can be useful in the event of an in-flight primary control failure. For example, if the linkage between the cabin and  the elevator fails in flight, leaving the elevator free to weathervane in the wind, the trim tab can be used to raise or lower the elevator  within limits. The trim tabs are not as effective as normal linkage control in conditions such as low airspeed, but they do have some  positive effect—usually enough to bring about a safe landing.  

If an elevator becomes jammed, resulting in a total loss of elevator control movement, various combinations of power and flap  extension offer a limited amount of pitch control. A successful landing under these conditions, however, can be problematic.  

# Landing Gear Malfunction  

Once the pilot has confirmed that the landing gear has in fact malfunctioned and that one or more gear legs refuses to respond to the  conventional or alternate methods of gear extension contained in the AFM/POH, a gear-up landing is considered inevitable. The pilot  should select an airport with crash and rescue facilities, if possible. The pilot should not hesitate to request that emergency equipment  is standing by.  

When selecting a landing surface, the pilot should consider that a smooth, hard-surface runway usually causes less damage than a  rough, unimproved grass strip. A hard surface does, however, create sparks that can ignite fuel. If the airport is so equipped, the pilot  can request that the runway surface be foamed. The pilot should consider burning off excess fuel. This reduces landing speed and fire  potential.  

If the landing gear malfunction is limited to one main landing gear leg, the pilot should consume as much fuel from that side of the  airplane as practicable, thereby reducing the weight of the wing on that side. The reduced weight makes it possible to delay the  unsupported wing from contacting the surface during the landing roll until the last possible moment. Reduced impact speeds result in  less damage.  

If only one landing gear leg fails to extend, the pilot has the option of landing on the available gear legs or landing with all the gear  legs retracted. Landing on only one main gear usually causes the airplane to veer strongly in the direction of the faulty gear leg after  touchdown. If the landing runway is narrow and/or ditches and obstacles line the runway edge, maximum directional control after  touchdown is a necessity. In this situation, a landing with all three gear retracted may be the safest course of action.  

If the pilot elects to land with one main gear retracted (and the other main gear and nose gear down and locked), the landing should  be made in a nose-high attitude with the wings level. As airspeed decays, the pilot should apply whatever aileron control is necessary  to keep the unsupported wing airborne as long as possible.  [Figure 18-7]  Once the wing contacts the surface, the pilot can anticipate  a strong yaw in that direction. The pilot should be prepared to use full opposite rudder and aggressive braking to maintain some  degree of directional control.

Figure 18-7.  Landing with one main gear retracted.  

When landing with a retracted nose-wheel (and the main gear extended and locked), the pilot should hold the nose off the ground  until almost full up-elevator has been applied.  [Figure 18-8]  The pilot should then release back pressure in such a manner that the  nose settles slowly to the surface. Applying and holding full up-elevator results in the nose abruptly dropping to the surface as  airspeed decays, possibly resulting in burrowing and/or additional damage. Brake pressure should not be applied during the landing  roll unless absolutely necessary to avoid a collision with obstacles.

Figure 18-8.  Landing with nose-wheel retracted.  

If the landing occurs with only the nose gear extended, the initial contact should be made on the aft fuselage structure with a nose- high attitude. This procedure helps prevent porpoising and/or wheelbarrowing. The pilot should then allow the nose-wheel to  gradually touchdown, using nose-wheel steering as necessary for directional control.  

# System Malfunctions  Electrical System  

The loss of electrical power can deprive the pilot of numerous critical systems, and therefore should not be taken lightly even in  day/visual flight rules (VFR) conditions. Most in-flight failures of the electrical system are located in the generator or alternator. Once  the generator or alternator system goes off line, the electrical source in a typical light airplane is a battery. If a warning light or  ammeter indicates the probability of an alternator or generator failure in an airplane with only one generating system, however, the  pilot may have very little time available from the battery.  

The rating of the airplane battery provides a clue as to how long it may last. With batteries, the higher the amperage load, the faster  any available stored energy gets consumed. Thus, a 25-amp hour battery could produce 5 amps per hour for 5 hours, but if the load  were increased to 10 amps, it might last only 2 hours. A 40-amp load might discharge the battery fully in about 10 or 15 minutes.  Much depends on the battery condition at the time of the system failure. If the battery has been in service for a few years, its power  may be reduced substantially because of internal resistance. Or if the system failure was not detected immediately, much of the stored  energy may have already been used. It is essential, therefore, that the pilot immediately shed non-essential loads when the generating  source fails.  [Figure 18-9]  The pilot should then plan to land at the nearest suitable airport.  

What   constitutes   an   “emergency”   load   following   a generating   system   failure   cannot   be   predetermined   because   the   actual  circumstances are always somewhat different—for example, whether the flight is VFR or instrument flight rules (IFR), conducted in  day or at night, in clouds or in the clear. Distance to nearest suitable airport can also be a factor.  

The pilot should remember that the electrically-powered (or electrically-selected) landing gear and flaps do not function properly on  the power left in a partially-depleted battery. Landing gear and flap motors use power at rates much greater than most other types of  electrical equipment. The result of selecting these motors on a partially-depleted battery may well result in an immediate total loss of  electrical power.  

![Figure 18-9.  Electrical load for light single.  ](images/8807f1123fe14dac5fa2e0e645d399721d4794172caaf1569c36b6a6244b3521.jpg)  

If the pilot expects an imminent and complete in-flight loss of electrical power, the following steps should be taken:  

⦁  Shed all but the most necessary electrically-driven equipment.  ⦁  Understand that any loss of electrical power is critical in a small airplane—notify ATC of the situation  immediately. Request radar vectors for a landing at the nearest suitable airport.  ⦁  If landing gear or flaps are electrically controlled or operated, plan the arrival well ahead of time. Expect to  make a no-flap landing and anticipate a manual landing gear extension.  

# Pitot-Static System  

The source of the pressure for operating the airspeed indicator, the vertical speed indicator (VSI), and the altimeter is the pitot-static  system. The major components of the pitot-static system are the impact pressure chamber and lines and the static pressure chamber  and lines, each of which are subject to total or partial blockage by ice, dirt, and/or other foreign matter. Blockage of the pitot-static  system adversely affects instrument operation.  [Figure 18-10]  

Partial static system blockage is insidious in that it may go unrecognized until a critical phase of flight. During takeoff, climb, and  level-off at cruise altitude the altimeter, airspeed indicator, and VSI may operate normally. No indication of malfunction may be  present until the airplane begins a descent.  

![](images/c404942992c629b392f396c90679b17a1581cf8eab78c0f6776bd18209b070c1.jpg)  
Figure 18-10.  Effects of blocked pitot-static sources.  

If the static reference system is severely restricted, but not entirely blocked, as the airplane descends, the static reference pressure at  the instruments begins to lag behind the actual outside air pressure. While descending, the altimeter may indicate that the airplane is  higher than actual because the obstruction slows the airflow from the static port to the altimeter. The VSI confirms the altimeter’s   information regarding rate of change because the reference pressure is not changing at the same rate as the outside air pressure. The  airspeed indicator, unable to tell whether it is experiencing more airspeed pitot pressure or less static reference pressure, indicates a  higher airspeed than actual. To the pilot, the instruments indicate that the airplane is too high, too fast, and descending at a rate much  lower than desired.  

If the pilot levels off and then begins a climb, the altitude indication may still lag. The VSI indicates that the airplane is not climbing  as fast as actual. The indicated airspeed, however, may begin to decrease at an alarming rate. The least amount of pitch-up attitude  may cause the airspeed needle to indicate dangerously near stall speed.  

Managing   a static   system   malfunction   requires   that   the   pilot   know   and   understand   the   airplane’s   pitot-static system. If a system  malfunction is suspected, the pilot should confirm it by opening the alternate static source. This should be done while the airplane is  climbing or descending. If the instrument needles move significantly when this is done, a static pressure problem exists and the  alternate source should be used during the remainder of the flight.  

Failure of the pitot-static system may also have serious consequences for Electronic Flight Instrument Systems (EFIS). To satisfy the  requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 23, section 23.2615(b)(2), information essential for  continued safe flight and landing will be available to the flightcrew in a timely manner after any single failure or probable  combination of failures. However, many of the light aircraft equipped with glass displays typically share the same pitot-static inputs  for the backup instrumentation. Since both systems are receiving the same input signals, both could fail if affected by obstructed or  blocked pitot tubes and static ports and create a difficult situation for a pilot flying in IMC. Some manufacturers combine both the air  data computer (ADC) and the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) functions so that a blockage of the input system may  also affect the attitude display.  

With conventional instrumentation, the design and operation are similar regardless of aircraft or manufacturer. By  comparing information between the six conventional instruments, pilots are able to diagnose common failure modes.  Instrument failure indications of conventional instruments and electronic flight displays may be entirely different, and  electronic systems failure indications are not standardized. With the wide diversity in system design of glass displays, the  primary display and the backup display may respond differently to any interruption of data input, and both displays may  function differently than conventional instruments under the same conditions.  

It is imperative for pilots to obtain equipment-specific information in reference to both the aircraft and the avionics that fully prepare  them to interpret and properly respond to equipment malfunctions of electronic flight instrument displays. Rapidly changing  equipment, complex systems, and the difficulty or inability to simulate failure modes and functions can impose training limitations.  Pilots still should be able to respond to equipment malfunctions in a timely manner without impairing other critical flight tasks should  the need arise.  

# Abnormal Engine Instrument Indication  

The AFM/POH for the specific airplane contains information that should be followed in the event of any abnormal engine instrument  indications. The table shown in  Figure 18-11  offers generic information on some of the more commonly experienced in-flight  abnormal engine instrument indications, their possible causes, and corrective actions.

# Door Opening In-Flight  

In most instances, the occurrence of an inadvertent door opening is not of great concern to the safety of a flight, but rather,   the pilot’s   reaction at the moment the incident happens. A door opening in flight may be accompanied by a sudden loud noise, sustained noise  level, and possible vibration or buffeting. If a pilot allows himself or herself to become distracted to the point where attention is  focused on the open door rather than maintaining control of the airplane, loss of control may result even though disruption of airflow  by the door is minimal.  

In the event of an inadvertent door opening in flight or on takeoff, the pilot should adhere to the following:  

⦁  Concentrate on flying the airplane. Particularly in light single and twin-engine airplanes; a cabin door that      opens    flight seldom    ever   compromises the airplane’s   ability    fly.   There may   be some handling       effects, such as roll and/or yaw, but in most instances these can be easily overcome.  ⦁  If the door opens after lift-off, do not rush to land. Climb to normal traffic pattern altitude, fly a normal      traffic pattern, and make a normal landing.  ⦁  Do not release the seat belt and shoulder harness in an attempt to reach the door. Leave the door alone.      Land as soon as practicable, and close the door once safely on the ground.  ⦁  Remember that most doors do not stay wide open. They usually bang open and then settle partly closed. A      slip towards the door may cause it to open wider; a slip away from the door may push it closed.  ⦁  Do not panic. Try to ignore the unfamiliar noise and vibration. Also, do not rush. Attempting to get the      airplane on the ground as quickly as possible may result in steep turns at low altitude.  ⦁  Complete all items on the landing checklist.  ⦁  Remember that accidents are almost never caused by an open door. Rather, an open door accident is caused      by   the pilot’s   distraction   or   failure to   maintain   control of   the airplane.  

# Inadvertent VFR Flight Into IMC  

It is beyond the scope of this handbook to incorporate a course of training in basic attitude instrument flying. This information is  contained in the Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15). Certain pilot certificates and/or associated ratings require training in  instrument flying and a demonstration of specific instrument flying tasks on the practical test.  

Pilots and flight instructors should refer to  the Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15)  for guidance in the performance of  these tasks and to the appropriate airman certification standards (ACS) for information on the evaluation of tasks performed for the  particular certificate level and/or rating. The pilot should remember, however, that unless these tasks are practiced on a continuing  and   regular   basis,   skill erosion   begins   almost immediately.   In   a very   short time,   the pilot’s   assumed   level of   confidence    much  higher than the performance he or she is actually able to demonstrate should the need arise.  

Accident statistics show that the pilot who has not been trained in attitude instrument flying, or one whose instrument skills have  eroded, lose control of the airplane in about 10 minutes once forced to rely solely on instrument references. The purpose of this  section is to provide guidance on practical emergency measures to maintain airplane control for a limited period of time in the event a  VFR pilot encounters instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The main goal is not precision instrument flying; rather, it is to  help the VFR pilot keep the airplane under adequate control until suitable visual references are regained.  

The first steps necessary for surviving an encounter with IMC by a VFR pilot are as follows:  

⦁  Recognition and acceptance of the seriousness of the situation and the need for immediate remedial action  ⦁  Maintaining control of the airplane  ⦁  Obtaining the appropriate assistance to get the airplane safely on the ground  

# Recognition  

Anytime a VFR pilot is unable to maintain airplane attitude control by reference to the natural horizon, the condition is considered to  be IMC regardless of the circumstances or the prevailing weather conditions. Whether the cause is inadventent or intentional, the  VFR pilot is, in effect, in IMC if unable to navigate or establish geographical position by visual reference to landmarks on the  surface. These situations should be accepted by the pilot involved as a genuine emergency requiring appropriate action.  

Pilots should understand that unless they are trained, qualified, and current in the control of an airplane solely by reference to flight  instruments, they will be unable to do so for any length of time. Many hours of VFR flying using the attitude indicator as a reference  for airplane control may lull pilots into a false sense of security based on an overestimation of their personal ability to control the  airplane solely by instrument references. In VFR conditions, even though the pilot believes the instrument references will be easy to  use, the pilot also receives an overview of the natural horizon and may subconsciously rely on it more than the attitude indicator. If  the natural horizon were to suddenly disappear, the untrained instrument pilot would be subject to vertigo, spatial disorientation, and  inevitable control loss.  

# Maintaining Airplane Control  

Once the pilot recognizes and accepts the situation, he or she should understand that the only way to control the airplane safely is by  using and trusting the flight instruments. Attempts to control the airplane partially by reference to flight instruments while searching  outside of the airplane for visual confirmation of the information provided by those instruments results in inadequate airplane control.  This may be followed by spatial disorientation and complete control loss.  

The most important point to be stressed is that the pilot should not panic. The task at hand may seem overwhelming, and the situation  may be compounded by extreme apprehension. However, the pilot should make a conscious effort to relax. The pilot needs to  understand the most important concern—in fact the only concern at this point—is to keep the wings level. An uncontrolled turn or  bank usually leads to difficulty in achieving the objectives of any desired flight condition, but good bank control has the effect of  making pitch control much easier.  

The pilot should remember that a person cannot feel control pressures with a tight grip on the controls. Relaxing and learning to  “control with   the eyes and   the brain,” instead   of   only   the muscles usually   takes considerable conscious   effort.  

The pilot needs    believe what the flight instruments   show   about the airplane’s   attitude regardless   of   what the natural senses tell. The  vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) can and will confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear  cannot detect slight changes in airplane attitude, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a  period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated, leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has  changed when, in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.  

# Attitude Control  

An airplane is, by design, an inherently stable platform and, except in turbulent air, maintains approximately straight-and-level flight  if properly trimmed and left alone. It is designed to maintain a state of equilibrium in pitch, roll, and yaw. The pilot should be aware,  however, that a change about one axis affects the stability of the others. The typical light airplane exhibits a good deal of stability in  the yaw axis, slightly less in the pitch axis, and even lesser still in the roll axis. The key to emergency airplane attitude control,  therefore, is to:  

⦁  Resist the tendency to over-control the airplane. Fly the attitude indicator with fingertip control. No attitude  changes should be made unless the flight instruments indicate a definite need for a change.  ⦁  Make all attitude changes smooth and small, yet with positive pressure. Remember that a small change as  indicated on the horizon bar corresponds to a proportionately much larger change in actual airplane  attitude.  ⦁  Make use of any available aid in attitude control, such as autopilot or wing leveler.  

The primary instrument for attitude control is the attitude indicator.  [Figure 18-12]  Once the airplane is trimmed so that it maintains  hands-off level flight at cruise airspeed, that airspeed need not vary until the airplane is slowed for landing. All turns, climbs, and  descents   can   and   should   be made at this   airspeed.   Straight flight is   maintained   by   keeping   the wings   level using   “fingertip   pressure”   on the control wheel. Any pitch attitude change should be made by using no more than one bar width up or down.  

![](images/fa93af2519a2d4e6b087e6d719b25b06e8226cf09266d1475f8a62ec5ef080b3.jpg)  
Figure 18-12.  Attitude indicator.  

# Turns  

Turns are perhaps the most potentially dangerous maneuver for the untrained instrument pilot for two reasons:  

⦁  The normal tendency of the pilot to over-control, leading    steep   banks   and   the possibility   of   a “graveyard   spiral.”  

⦁  The inability of the pilot to cope with the instability resulting from the turn.  

When a turn is to be made, the pilot should anticipate and cope with the relative instability of the roll axis. The smallest practical  bank angle should be used—in any case no more than   $10^{\circ}$   bank   angle.   [Figure 18-13]  A shallow bank takes very little vertical lift  from the wings resulting in little if any deviation in altitude. It may be helpful to turn a few degrees and then return to level flight if a  large change in heading is necessary. Repeat the process until the desired heading is reached. This process may relieve the  progressive overbanking that often results from prolonged turns.  

![](images/c47091dadfc1fe90acb338f4f49bad90dd7b22d0ddc779acb97a4fcf4c5d37ec.jpg)  
Figure 18-13.  Level turn.  

# Climbs  

If a climb is necessary, the pilot should raise the miniature airplane on the attitude indicator no more than one bar width and apply  power.  [Figure 18-14]  The pilot should not attempt to attain a specific climb speed but accept whatever speed results. The objective  is   to   deviate as little as possible from   level flight attitude in   order   to   disturb   the airplane’s   equilibrium   as little as possible. If the  airplane is properly trimmed, it assumes a nose-up attitude on its own commensurate with the amount of power applied. Torque and  P-factor cause the airplane to have a tendency to bank and turn to the left. This should be anticipated and compensated for. If the  initial power application results in an inadequate rate of climb, power should be increased in increments of 100 rpm or 1 inch of  manifold pressure until the desired rate of climb is attained. Maximum available power is seldom necessary. The more power that is  used, the more the airplane wants to bank and turn to the left. Resuming level flight is accomplished by first decreasing pitch attitude  to level on the attitude indicator using slow but deliberate pressure, allowing airspeed to increase to near cruise value and then  decreasing power.  

![](images/cd6b5276123eb9bbe849abf151998b049534ff8c354b7f2bbe22f22c848f1d69.jpg)  
Figure 18-14.  Level climb.  

# Descents  

Descents are very much the opposite of the climb procedure if the airplane is properly trimmed for hands-off straight-and-level flight.  In this configuration, the airplane requires a certain amount of thrust to maintain altitude. The pitch attitude is controlling the  airspeed. The engine power, therefore, (translated into thrust by the propeller) is maintaining the selected altitude. Following a power  reduction, however slight, there is an almost imperceptible decrease in airspeed. However, even a slight change in speed results in  less down load on the tail, whereupon the designed nose heaviness of the airplane causes it to pitch down just enough to maintain the  airspeed for which it was trimmed. The airplane then descends at a rate directly proportionate to the amount of thrust that has been  removed. Power reductions should be made in increments of 100 rpm or 1 inch of manifold pressure and the resulting rate of descent  should never exceed 500 fpm. The wings should be held level on the attitude indicator, and the pitch attitude should not exceed one  bar width below level.  [Figure 18-15]  

![](images/7de5429c08fba956d68769bfa0bd875fb52421e0a1d4e55ce5d081b7dc92947c.jpg)  
Figure 18-15.  Level descent.  

# Combined Maneuvers  

Combined maneuvers, such as climbing or descending turns, should be avoided if at all possible by an untrained instrument pilot.  Combining maneuvers only compounds the problems encountered in individual maneuvers and increases the risk of control loss. The  objective is   to   keep   the airplane under   control by   maintaining   as much   of   the airplane’s   natural equilibrium   as possible.   Deviating as  little as possible from straight-and-level flight attitude makes this much easier.  

When being assisted by ATC, the pilot may detect a sense of urgency while being directed to change heading and/or altitude. This  sense of urgency reflects a normal concern for safety on the part of the controller. Nevertheless, the pilot should not let this prompting  lead to rushing into a maneuver that could result in loss of control. It's reasonable to ask the controller to slow down, if this becomes  an issue.  

# Transition to Visual Flight  

One of the most difficult tasks a trained and qualified instrument pilot contends with is the transition from instrument to visual flight  prior to landing. For the untrained instrument pilot, these difficulties are magnified.  

The difficulties center around acclimatization and orientation. On an instrument approach, the trained instrument pilot prepares in  advance for the transition to visual flight. The pilot has a mental picture of what to expect when the transition to visual flight is made  and will quickly acclimate to the new environment. Geographical orientation also begins before the transition, as the pilot visualizes  where the airplane is in relation to the airport/runway.  

In an ideal situation, the transition to visual flight is made with ample time, at a sufficient altitude above terrain, and to visibility  conditions sufficient to accommodate acclimatization and geographical orientation. This, however, is not always the case. The  untrained instrument pilot may find the visibility still limited, the terrain completely unfamiliar, and altitude above terrain such that a  “normal” airport traffic pattern   and   landing   approach    not possible.   Additionally,   the pilot is   most likely   under   considerable self- induced psychological pressure to get the airplane on the ground. The pilot should take this into account and, if possible, allow time  to become acclimatized and geographically oriented before attempting an approach and landing, even if it means flying straight and  level for a time or circling the airport. This is especially true at night.  

# Emergency Response Systems  

Airplanes may have installed systems that provide alternatives in certain emergency situations. For example, ballistic parachute  systems, if installed, may be deployed in an emergency allowing an airplane to descend slowly enough toward the ground such that  occupants usually survive the resulting impact with minor or no injuries. Airplanes may also have an Emergency Autoland (EAL)  system, which can take over control of the aircraft when necessary for a safe outcome.  

# Ballistic Parachutes  

Deployment of an airplane ballistic parachute system results in the loss of the airframe, but deploying such systems within an  acceptable flight regime prevents injuries and saves lives. Pilots need to understand and follow the procedures for arming and  disarming these systems before and after flight, and understand the conditions under which the system would be deployed. For  example, a catastrophic loss of controllability due to a collision or mechanical failure, actual loss of control, or pilot incapacitation  would qualify. Pilots should brief passengers with access to any deployment mechanism regarding the conditions for a safe  deployment. Generally, the passenger would deploy the system only if the pilot were incapacitated. At a minimum, the pilot should  also brief the passengers regarding the basic sequence of steps for deployment. Pilots should study the information provided by  manufacturers and suppliers of these systems and follow the guidance provided.  

The system design may include airplane components designed to absorb the forces of vertical impact. The design of landing gear and  seats maximize the protection afforded to the occupants and extend the time over which impact forces are absorbed. Once on the  ground, there are hazards associated with a deployed parachute and the effect of surface winds, and the occupants should know the  procedures for evacuation.  

# Autoland  

If the EAL senses erratic flying, it stabilizes the aircraft, and checks for pilot responsiveness. Without further input, the EAL initiates  an emergency descent. Without pilot responsiveness after an emergency descent, EAL initiates the process for an automated landing.  The system also allows for manual activation by a pilot or a passenger.  

Once   activated,   the EAL   system   transmits   automated   radio   broadcasts   on   the aircraft’s   last   selected   frequency   and   on   Guard   (121.5  MHz)   to   alert controllers   or   pilots   in   the area   of   the EAL   aircraft’s   imminent arrival to   the selected   runway.   The system   repeatedly  transmits the call sign and intention to divert to a particular airport and runway using a recognizable non-human synthesized voice.  Additionally, EAL sets the transponder to squawk 7700 to indicate an emergency. After the initial broadcast, the system pauses for 25  seconds to allow air traffic control (ATC) to communicate with potential conflicting traffic. Once the EAL aircraft is within 12 miles  of the selected runway and at or below 12,000 feet MSL, it broadcasts on the tower frequency or Common Traffic Advisory  Frequency (CTAF), and continues to broadcast its position via ADS-B.   It announces   its   call sign,“pilot incapacitation,” its   position   relative to the destination airport, gives the airport and airport identifier, and the time to landing on a specific runway at that airport.  The system   makes a   similar   “one-minute out” broadcast prior    landing.  

The EAL system selects a suitable landing airfield based on several factors. These factors include weather, wind, runway length, and  towered/non-towered airport status. EAL only considers airports with an area navigation (RNAV) or Global Positioning System  (GPS) approach, selects towered airports over non-towered airports where possible, and uses runway requirements that depend on the  aircraft type. EAL systems also utilize obstacle and a terrain databases. If the system loses GPS coverage, the airplane continues  straight flight without attempting to land until GPS coverage resumes.  

Currently EAL system capabilities do not include detecting and avoiding other aircraft; receiving or reacting to ATC instructions or  Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs); avoiding military operations areas (MOAs), special use airspace (SUA), Restricted Areas, or  Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs); or turning on aircraft lights.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provided general guidance and recommended procedures that may apply to light single-engine airplanes involved in  certain emergency situations. The information presented is intended to enhance the general knowledge of emergency operations with  the clear understanding that the manufacturer’s recommended emergency procedures take precedence.  

Information was provided concerning failure of the pitot-static system in aircraft with EFIS. The redundancy of backup systems for  IFR flight may be less than desired if both the primary and backup instrumentation may receive signal data input from the same pitot- static source. The failure indications of EFIS may be entirely different from conventional instruments making recognition of system  malfunction much more difficult for the pilot. Lack of system standardization compounds the problem making equipment specific  information and knowledge an important asset when analyzing electronic display malfunctions. The inability to simulate certain  failure modes during training and evaluation could make the pilot less prepared for an actual emergency. As electronic avionics  become more advanced, the training and proficiency needed to safely operate these systems should receive careful analysis.

The portion of the combustor where the gases are collected to be evenly distributed to the turbine blades.  Turbine rotors.  The portion of the turbine assembly that mounts to the shaft and holds the turbine blades in place.  Turbine section.  The section of the engine that converts high pressure high temperature gas into rotational energy.  

Turbocharger.  An air compressor driven by exhaust gases, which increases the pressure of the air going into the engine through the  carburetor or fuel injection system.  

Turbofan engine.  A turbojet engine in which additional propulsive thrust is gained by extending a portion of the compressor or  turbine blades outside the inner engine case. The extended blades propel bypass air along the engine axis but between the inner and  outer casing. The air is not combusted but does provide additional thrust.  

Turbojet engine.  A jet engine incorporating a turbine-driven air compressor to take in and compress air for the combustion of fuel,  the gases of combustion being used both to rotate the turbine and create a thrust producing jet.  

Turboprop engine.  A turbine engine that drives a propeller through a reduction gearing arrangement. Most of the energy in the  exhaust gases is converted into torque, rather than its acceleration being used to propel the aircraft.  

Turbulence.  An occurrence in which a flow of fluid is unsteady.  

Turn coordinator.  A rate gyro that senses both roll and yaw due to the gimbal being canted. Has largely replaced the turn-and-slip  indicator in modern aircraft.  

Turn-and-slip indicator.  A flight instrument consisting of a rate gyro to indicate the rate of yaw and a curved glass inclinometer to  indicate the relationship between gravity and centrifugal force. The turn-and-slip indicator indicates the relationship between angle of  bank and rate of yaw. Also called a turn-and-bank indicator.  

Turning error.  One of the errors inherent in a magnetic compass caused by the dip compensating weight. It shows up only on turns to  or from northerly headings in the Northern Hemisphere and southerly headings in the Southern Hemisphere. Turning error causes the  compass to lead turns to the north or south and lag turns away from the north or south.  

Ultimate load factor.  In stress analysis, the load that causes physical breakdown in an aircraft or aircraft component during a strength  test, or the load that according to computations, should cause such a breakdown.  

Unfeathering accumulator.  Tanks that hold oil under pressure which can be used to unfeather a propeller.  

UNICOM.  A nongovernment air/ground radio communication station which may provide airport information at public use airports  where there is no tower or FSS.  

Unusable fuel.  Fuel that cannot be consumed by the engine. This fuel is considered part of the empty weight of the aircraft.  

Useful load.  The weight of the pilot, copilot, passengers, baggage, usable fuel, and drainable oil. It is the basic empty weight  subtracted from the maximum allowable gross weight. This term applies to general aviation aircraft only.  

Utility category.  An airplane that has a seating configuration, excluding pilot seats, of nine or less, a maximum certificated takeoff  weight of 12,500 pounds or less, and intended for limited acrobatic operation.  

$\mathbf{V_{1}}$  .  Critical engine failure speed or takeoff decision speed. It is the speed at which the pilot is to continue  th e takeoff in the event of an  engine failure or other serious emergency. At speeds less than   $\mathrm{V}_{1}$  , it is considered safer to stop the aircraft within the accelerate-stop  distance. It is also the minimum speed in the takeoff, following a failure of the critical engine at   $\mathrm{V_{EF}}.$  , at which the pilot can continue  the takeoff and achieve the required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance.  

$\mathbf{V}_{2}.$  .  takeoff safety speed, or a referenced airspeed obtained after lift-off at which the required one engine-inoperative climb  performance can be achieved.  

$\mathbf{V_{A}}$  .  The design maneuvering speed. This is the “rough air” speed and the maximum speed for abrupt maneuvers. If during flight,  rough air or severe turbulence is encountered, reduce the airspeed to maneuvering speed or less to minimize stress on the airplane  structure. It is important to consider weight when referencing this speed. For example,   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$    may be 100 knots when an airplane is  heavily loaded, but only 90 knots when the load is light.  

Vapor lock.  A condition in which air enters the fuel system and it may be difficult, or impossible, to restart the engine. Vapor lock  may occur as a result of running a fuel tank completely dry, allowing air to enter the fuel system. On fuel-injected engines, the fuel  may become so hot it vaporizes in the fuel line, not allowing fuel to reach the cylinders.  

V-bars.  The flight director displays on the attitude indicator that provide control guidance to the pilot.  

Vector.  A force vector is a graphic representation of a force and shows both the magnitude and direction of the force.  

Velocity.  The speed or rate of movement in a certain direction.  

Vertical axis.  An imaginary line passing vertically through the center of gravity of an aircraft. The vertical axis is called the   $\mathrm{_{Z}}$  -axis or  the yaw axis.  

Vertical card compass.  A magnetic compass that consists of an azimuth on a vertical card, resembling a heading indicator with a  fixed miniature airplane to accurately present the heading of the aircraft. The design uses eddy current damping to minimize lead and  lag during turns.  

Vertical speed indicator (VSI).  An instrument that uses static pressure to display a rate of climb or descent in feet per minute. The  VSI can also sometimes be called a vertical velocity indicator (VVI).  

Vertical stability.  Stability about an aircraft’s vertical axis. Also called yawing or directional stability.

The chart depicts topographic information and aeronautical information which includes visual and radio  aids to navigation, airports, controlled airspace, restricted areas, obstructions, and related data.  

V-G diagram.  A chart that relates velocity to load factor. It is valid only for a specific weight, configuration, and altitude and shows  the maximum amount of positive or negative lift the airplane is capable of generating at a given speed. Also shows the safe load factor  limits and the load factor that the aircraft can sustain at various speeds.  

Visual approach slope indicator (VASI).  The most common visual glidepath system in use. The VASI provides obstruction  clearance within  $10^{\circ}$   of the extended runway centerline, and to 4 nautical miles (NM) from the runway threshold.  

$\mathbf{V_{LE}}$  .  Landing gear extended speed. The maximum speed at which an airplane can be safely flown with the landing gear extended.  

$\mathbf{V_{LO}}$  .  Landing gear operating speed. The maximum speed for extending or retracting the landing gear if using an airplane equipped  with retractable landing gear.  

$\mathbf{V_{LOF}}$  .  Lift-off speed. The speed at which the aircraft departs the runway during takeoff.  

$\mathbf{V_{MC}}.$    Minimum control airspeed. This is the minimum flight speed at which a twin-engine airplane can be satisfactorily controlled  when an engine suddenly becomes inoperative and the remaining engine is at takeoff power.  

$\mathbf{V_{MD}}$  .  Minimum drag speed.  

$\mathbf{V_{MO}}$  .  Maximum operating speed expressed in knots.  

$\mathbf{V_{NE}}$  .  Never-exceed speed. Operating above this speed is prohibited since it may result in damage or structural failure. The red line on  the airspeed indicator.  

$\bf V_{N O}$  .  Maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air. The upper limit of the green arc.  

$\mathbf{V_{P}}$  .  Minimum dynamic hydroplaning speed. The minimum speed required to start dynamic hydroplaning.  

$\mathbf{V_{R}}$  .  Rotation speed. The speed that the pilot begins rotating the aircraft prior to lift-off.  

$\bf V_{S0}$  .  Stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration. In small airplanes, this is the power-off stall  speed at the maximum landing weight in the landing configuration (gear and flaps down). The lower limit of the white arc.  

${\bf V_{S1}}$  .  Stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed obtained in a specified configuration. For most airplanes, this is the power-off  stall speed at the maximum takeoff weight in the clean configuration (gear up, if retractable, and flaps up). The lower limit of the green  arc.  

V-speeds.  Designated speeds for a specific flight condition.  

$\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}\mathbf{E}}$  .  Safe, intentional one-engine inoperative speed. The minimum speed to intentionally render the critical engine inoperative.  

V-tail.  A design which utilizes two slanted tail surfaces to perform the same functions as the surfaces of a conventional elevator and  rudder configuration. The fixed surfaces act as both horizontal and vertical stabilizers.  

$\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{X}}$  .  Best angle-of-climb speed. The airspeed at which an airplane gains the greatest amount of altitude in a given distance. It is used  during a short-field takeoff to clear an obstacle.  

$\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{XSE}}$  .  Best angle of climb speed with one engine inoperative. The airspeed at which an airplane gains the greatest amount of altitude  in a given distance in a light, twin-engine airplane following an engine failure.  

$\mathbf{V_{Y}}$  .  Best rate-of-climb speed. This airspeed provides the most altitude gain in a given period of time.  

$\mathbf{V_{YSE}}$  .  Best rate-of-climb speed with one engine inoperative. This airspeed provides the most altitude gain in a given period of time in a  light, twin-engine airplane following an engine failure.  

#  

Wake turbulence.  Wingtip vortices that are created when an airplane generates lift. When an airplane generates lift, air spills over the  wingtips from the high pressure areas below the wings to the low pressure areas above them. This flow causes rapidly rotating  whirlpools of air called wingtip vortices or wake turbulence.  

Waste gate.  A controllable valve in the tailpipe of an aircraft reciprocating engine equipped with a turbocharger. The valve is  controlled to vary the amount of exhaust gases forced through the turbocharger turbine.  

Weathervane.  The tendency of the aircraft to turn into the relative wind.  

Weight and balance.  The aircraft is said to be in weight and balance when the gross weight of the aircraft is under the max gross  weight, and the center of gravity is within limits and will remain in limits for the duration of the flight.  

Weight.  A measure of the heaviness of an object. The force by which a body is attracted toward the center of the earth (or another  celestial body) by gravity. Weight is equal to the mass of the body times the local value of gravitational acceleration. One of the four  main   forces   acting   on   an   aircraft.   Equivalent   to   the   actual   weight   of   the   aircraft.    acts   downward   through   the   aircraft’s   center of  gravity toward the center of the earth. Weight opposes lift.  

Wheelbarrowing.  A condition caused when forward yoke or stick pressure during takeoff or landing causes the aircraft to ride on the  nose-wheel alone.  

Wind correction angle.  Correction applied to the course to establish a heading so that track will coincide with course.  

Wind direction indicators.  Indicators that include a wind sock, wind tee, or tetrahedron. Visual reference will determine wind  direction and runway in use.  

Wind shear.  A sudden, drastic shift in wind speed, direction, or both that may occur in the horizontal or vertical plane.  

Windmilling.  When the air moving through a propeller creates the rotational energy.  

Windsock.  A truncated cloth cone open at both ends and mounted on a freewheeling pivot that indicates the direction from which the  wind is blowing.  

Wing area.  The total surface of the wing (square feet), which includes control surfaces and may include wing area covered by the  fuselage (main body of the airplane), and engine nacelles.  

Wing span.  The maximum distance from wingtip to wingtip.  

Wing twist.  A design feature incorporated into some wings to improve aileron control effectiveness at high angles of attack during an  approach to a stall.  

Wing.  Airfoil attached to each side of the fuselage and are the main lifting surfaces that support the airplane in flight.  

Wingtip vortices.  The rapidly   rotating   air   that spills   over   an   airplane’s   wings   during   flight. The intensity   of   the turbulence   depends   on   the   airplane’s   weight,   speed,   and   configuration.   It   is   also   referred   to   as wake   turbulence.   Vortices   from   heavy   aircraft   may   be  extremely hazardous to small aircraft.  

Yaw string.  A string on the nose or windshield of an aircraft in view of the pilot that indicates any slipping or skidding of the aircraft.  

Zero sideslip.  A maneuver in a twin-engine airplane with one engine inoperative that involves a small amount of bank and slightly  uncoordinated flight to align the fuselage with the direction of travel and minimize drag.  Zero thrust (simulated feather).  An engine configuration with a low power setting that simulates a propeller feathered condition.
