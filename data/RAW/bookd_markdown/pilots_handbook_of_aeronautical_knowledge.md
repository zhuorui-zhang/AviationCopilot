# Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge  

2023  

# Preface  

Th is handbook  provides  the  basic knowledge that is essential for pilots.  It  introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of  knowledge that will be needed as they progress in their pilot training. Except for the Code of Federal Regulations  pertinent to civil aviation, most of the knowledge areas applicable to pilot certification are presented. This handbook is  useful to beginning pilots, as well as those pursuing more advanced pilot certificates.  

Occasionally the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such  language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   and the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). The AIM is available online at www.faa.gov. The current Flight Standards  Service airman training and testing material and learning statements for all airman certificates and ratings can be obtained  from www.faa.gov.  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-25 B , Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, dated  2016; the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge Addendum A, dated February 2021; the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge Addendum B, dated January 2022; and the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge Addendum C,  dated March 2023.

# Chapter 1 Introduction  To Flying  

# Introduction  

The Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge provides  basic knowledge for the student pilot learning to fly, as well  as pilots seeking advanced pilot certification. For detailed  information on a variety of specialized flight topics, see  specific Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) handbooks  and Advisory Circulars (ACs).  

This chapter offers a brief history of flight, introduces the  history and role of the FAA in civil aviation, FAA regulations  and standards, government references and publications,  eligibility for pilot certificates, available routes to flight  instruction, the role of the Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI)  and Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) in flight training,  Practical Test Standards (PTS), and new, industry-developed  Airman Certification Standards (ACS) framework that will  eventually replace the PTS.  

# History of Flight  

From prehistoric times, humans have watched the flight of  birds, and longed to imitate them, but lacked the power to do  so. Logic dictated that if the small muscles of birds can lift  them into the air and sustain them, then the larger muscles  of humans should be able to duplicate the feat. No one knew  about the intricate mesh of muscles, sinew, heart, breathing  system, and devices not unlike wing flaps, variable-camber  and spoilers of the modern airplane that enabled a bird to  fly. Still, thousands of years and countless lives were lost in  attempts to fly like birds.  

The identity of the first “bird-men” who fitted themselves  with wings and leapt off of cliffs in an effort to fly are lost in  time, but each failure gave those who wished to fly questions  that needed to be answered. Where had the wing flappers  gone wrong? Philosophers, scientists, and inventors offered  solutions, but no one could add wings to the human body  and soar like a bird. During the 1500s, Leonardo da Vinci  filled pages of his notebooks with sketches of proposed  flying machines, but most of his ideas were flawed because  he clung to the idea of birdlike wings.  [Figure 1-1 ] By  1655, mathematician, physicist, and inventor Robert Hooke  concluded that the human body does not possess the strength  to power artificial wings. He believed human flight would  require some form of artificial propulsion.  

The quest for human flight led some practitioners in another  direction. In 1783, the first manned hot air balloon, crafted  by Joseph and Etienne Montgolfier, flew for 23 minutes.  Ten days later, Professor Jacques Charles flew the first gas  balloon. A madness for balloon flight captivated the public’s  imagination and for a time flying enthusiasts turned their  expertise to the promise of lighter-than-air flight. But for  all its majesty in the air, the balloon was little more than a

billowing heap of cloth capable of no more than a one-way,  downwind journey.  

Balloons solved the problem of lift, but that was only one of  the problems of human flight. The ability to control speed and  direction eluded balloonists. The solution to that problem lay  in a child’s toy familiar to the East for 2,000 years, but not  introduced to the West until the 13th century—the kite. The  kites used by the Chinese for aerial observation, to test winds  for sailing, as a signaling device, and as a toy, held many of  the answers to lifting a heavier-than-air device into the air.  

One of the men who believed the study of kites unlocked  the secrets of winged flight was Sir George Cayley. Born  in England 10 years before the Mongolfier balloon flight,  Cayley spent his 84 years seeking to develop a heavier-than- air vehicle supported by kite-shaped wings.  [Figure 1-2]  The  “Father of Aerial Navigation,” Cayley discovered the basic  principles on which the modern science of aeronautics is  founded; built what is recognized as the first successful flying  model; and tested the first full-size man-carrying airplane.

Figure 1-2.   Glider from 1852 by Sir George Cayley, British aviator  (1773–1857).  

For the half-century after Cayley’s death, countless scientists,  flying enthusiasts, and inventors worked toward building  a powered flying machine. Men, such as William Samuel  Henson, who designed a huge monoplane that was propelled  by a steam engine housed inside the fuselage, and Otto  Lilienthal, who proved human flight in aircraft heavier than  air was practical, worked toward the dream of powered flight.  A dream turned into reality by Wilbur and Orville Wright at  Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903.  

The bicycle-building Wright brothers of Dayton, Ohio, had  experimented for 4 years with kites, their own homemade  wind tunnel, and different engines to power their biplane. One  of their great achievements in flight was proving the value of  the scientific, rather than a build-it-and-see approach. Their  biplane, The Flyer, combined inspired design and engineering  with superior craftsmanship.  [Figure 1-3]  By the afternoon  of December 17th, the Wright brothers had flown a total of  98 seconds on four flights. The age of flight had arrived.  

# History of the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA)  

During the early years of manned flight, aviation was a  free for all because no government body was in place to  establish policies or regulate and enforce safety standards.  Individuals were free to conduct flights and operate aircraft  with no government oversight. Most of the early flights were  conducted for sport. Aviation was expensive and became the  playground of the wealthy. Since these early airplanes were  small, many people doubted their commercial value. One  group of individuals believed otherwise and they became  the genesis for modern airline travel.  

P. E. Fansler, a Florida businessman living in St. Petersburg,  approached Tom Benoist of the Benoist Aircraft Company  in St. Louis, Missouri, about starting a flight route from St.  

![](images/cbe5e7a35b75deb8ee6e397ef431e70dd57424de943f1f32e6fc69e6b23e4176.jpg)  
Figure 1-3.  First flight by the Wright brothers.  

Petersburg across the waterway to Tampa. Benoist suggested  using his “Safety First” airboat and the two men signed an  agreement for what would become the first scheduled airline  in the United States. The first aircraft was delivered to St.  Petersburg and made the first test flight on December 31,  1913.  [Figure 1-4]  

A public auction decided who would win the honor of  becoming the first paying airline customer. The former  mayor of St. Petersburg, A. C. Pheil, made the winning bid  of   $\S400.00$  , which secured his place in history as the first  paying airline passenger.  

On January 1, 1914, the first scheduled airline flight was  conducted. The flight length was 21 miles and lasted 23  minutes due to a headwind. The return trip took 20 minutes.  The line, which was subsidized by Florida businessmen,  continued for 4 months and offered regular passage for  $\S5.00$    per person or  $\S5.00$   per 100 pounds of cargo. Shortly after the  opening of the line, Benoist added a new airboat that afforded  more protection from spray during takeoff and landing.  The routes were also extended to Manatee, Bradenton, and  Sarasota giving further credence to the idea of a profitable  commercial airline.  

The St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line continued throughout  the winter months with flights finally being suspended when  the winter tourist industry began to dry up. The airline  operated for only 4 months, but 1,205 passengers were  carried without injury. This experiment proved commercial  passenger airline travel was viable.  

The advent of World War I offered the airplane a chance  to demonstrate its varied capabilities. It began the war as a  reconnaissance platform, but by 1918, airplanes were being

mass produced to serve as fighters, bombers, trainers, as well  as reconnaissance platforms.  

Aviation advocates continued to look for ways to use  airplanes. Airmail service was a popular idea, but the  war prevented the Postal Service from having access to  airplanes. The War Department and Postal Service reached an  agreement in 1918. The Army would use the mail service to  train its pilots in flying cross-country. The first airmail flight  was conducted on May 15, 1918, between New York and  Washington, DC. The flight was not considered spectacular;  the pilot became lost and landed at the wrong airfield. In  August of 1918, the United States Postal Service took control  of the airmail routes and brought the existing Army airmail  pilots and their planes into the program as postal employees.  

# Transcontinental Air Mail Route  

Airmail routes continued to expand until the Transcontinental  Mail Route was inaugurated.  [Figure 1-5]  This route spanned  from San Francisco to New York for a total distance of 2,612  miles with 13 intermediate stops along the way.  [Figure 1-6]  On May 20, 1926, Congress passed the Air Commerce Act,  which served as the cornerstone for aviation within the  United States. This legislation was supported by leaders in  the aviation industry who felt that the airplane could not  reach its full potential without assistance from the Federal  Government in improving safety.  

The Air Commerce Act charged the Secretary of Commerce  with fostering air commerce, issuing and enforcing air traffic  rules, licensing pilots, certificating aircraft, establishing  airways, and operating and maintaining aids to air navigation.  The Department of Commerce created a new Aeronautics  Branch whose primary mission was to provide oversight for the  aviation industry. In addition, the Aeronautics Branch took over  the construction and operation of the nation’s system of lighted  airways. The Postal Service, as part of the Transcontinental  Air Mail Route system, had initiated this system. The

Figure 1-6.   The transcontinental airmail route ran from New York  to San Francisco.  

Department of Commerce made significant advances in  aviation communications, including the introduction of radio  beacons as an effective means of navigation.  

Built at intervals of approximately 10 miles apart, the  standard beacon tower was 51 feet high, and was topped  with a powerful rotating light. Below the rotating light, two  course lights pointed forward and back along the airway. The  course lights flashed a code to identify the beacon’s number.  The tower usually stood in the center of a concrete arrow  70 feet long. A generator shed, where required, stood at the  “feather” end of the arrow.  [Figure 1-7]  

# Federal Certification of Pilots and Mechanics  

The Aeronautics Branch of the Department of Commerce  began pilot certification with the first license issued on April  6, 1927. The recipient was the Chief of the Aeronautics  Branch, William P. MacCracken, Jr.  [Figure 1-8]  (Orville  Wright, who was no longer an active flier, had declined the  honor.) MacCracken’s license was the first issued to a pilot  by a civilian agency of the Federal Government. Some 3  months later, the Aeronautics Branch issued the first Federal  aircraft mechanic license.  

Equally important for safety was the establishment of a  system of certification for aircraft. On March 29, 1927,  the Aeronautics Branch issued the first airworthiness  type certificate to the Buhl Airster CA-3, a three-place  open biplane.  

In 1934, to recognize the tremendous strides made in aviation  and to display the enhanced status within the department,  the Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air  Commerce.  [Figure 1-9]  Within this time frame, the Bureau  of Air Commerce brought together a group of airlines

The photograph  was taken in 1933. During Vidal’s tenure, the Aeronautics Branch  was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce on July 1, 1934. The  new name more accurately reflected the status of the organization  within the Department of Commerce.  

and encouraged them to form the first three Air Traffic  Control (ATC) facilities along the established air routes.  Then in 1936, the Bureau of Air Commerce took over the  responsibilities of operating the centers and continued to  advance the ATC facilities. ATC has come a long way from  the early controllers using maps, chalkboards, and performing  mental math calculations in order to separate aircraft along  flight routes.  

# The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938  

In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act transferred the civil  aviation responsibilities to a newly created, independent  body, named the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA). This  Act empowered the CAA to regulate airfares and establish  new routes for the airlines to service.  

President Franklin Roosevelt split the CAA into two  agencies—the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). Both agencies  were still part of the Department of Commerce but the CAB  functioned independently of the Secretary of Commerce.  The role of the CAA was to facilitate ATC, certification of  airmen and aircraft, rule enforcement, and the development  of new airways. The CAB was charged with rule making to  enhance safety, accident investigation, and the economic  regulation of the airlines. Then in 1946, Congress gave the  CAA the responsibility of administering the Federal Aid  Airport Program. This program was designed to promote  the establishment of civil airports throughout the country.  

# The Federal Aviation Act of 1958  

By mid-century, air traffic had increased and jet aircraft had  been introduced into the civil aviation arena. A series of  mid-air collisions underlined the need for more regulation  of the aviation industry. Aircraft were not only increasing in  numbers, but were now streaking across the skies at much  higher speeds. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established  a new independent body that assumed the roles of the CAA  and transferred the rule making authority of the CAB to the  newly created Federal Aviation Agency (FAA). In addition,  the FAA was given complete control of the common civil- military system of air navigation and ATC. The man who  was given the honor of being the first Administrator of the  FAA was former Air Force General Elwood Richard “Pete”  Quesada. He served as the administrator from 1959–1961.  [Figure 1-10]  

# Department of Transportation (DOT)  

On October 15, 1966, Congress established the Department  of Transportation (DOT), which was given oversight of the  transportation industry within the United States. The result  was a combination of both air and surface transportation. Its  mission was and is to serve the United States by ensuring a  fast, safe, efficient, accessible, and convenient transportation  system meeting vital national interests and enhancing the  quality of life of the American people, then, now, and into

the future. The DOT began operation on April 1, 1967. At  this same time, the Federal Aviation Agency was renamed  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  

The role of the CAB was assumed by the newly created  National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which was  charged with the investigation of all transportation accidents  within the United States.  

As aviation continued to grow, the FAA took on additional  duties and responsibilities. With the highjacking epidemic  of the 1960s, the FAA was responsible for increasing the  security duties of aviation both on the ground and in the air.  After September 11, 2001, the duties were transferred to  a newly created body called the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS).  

With numerous aircraft flying in and out of larger cities, the  FAA began to concentrate on the environmental aspect of  aviation by establishing and regulating the noise standards  of aircraft. Additionally, in the 1960s and 1970s, the FAA  began to regulate high altitude (over 500 feet) kite and balloon  flying. In 1970, more duties were assumed by the FAA in the  addition of a new federal airport aid program and increased  responsibility for airport safety.  

# ATC Automation  

By the mid-1970s, the FAA had achieved a semi-automated  ATC system based on a marriage of radar and computer  technology. By automating certain routine tasks, the system  allowed controllers to concentrate more efficiently on the  vital task of providing aircraft separation. Data appearing  directly on the controllers’ scopes provided the identity,  altitude, and groundspeed of aircraft carrying radar beacons.  Despite its effectiveness, this system required enhancement  to keep pace with the increased air traffic of the late 1970s.  The increase was due in part to the competitive environment  created by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. This law  phased out CAB’s economic regulation of the airlines, and  CAB ceased to exist at the end of 1984.  

To meet the challenge of traffic growth, the FAA unveiled  the National Airspace System (NAS) Plan in January  1982. The new plan called for more advanced systems  for en route and terminal ATC, modernized flight service  stations, and improvements in ground-to-air surveillance  and communication.  

# The Professional Air Traffic Controllers  Organization (PATCO) Strike  

While preparing the NAS Plan, the FAA faced a strike  by key members of its workforce. An earlier period of  discord between management and the Professional Air  Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) culminated in a  1970 “sickout” by 3,000 controllers. Although controllers  subsequently gained additional wage and retirement  benefits, another period of tension led to an illegal strike in  August 1981. The government dismissed over 11,000 strike  participants and decertified PATCO. By the spring of 1984,  the FAA ended the last of the special restrictions imposed to  keep the airspace system operating safely during the strike.  

# The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978  

Until 1978, the CAB regulated many areas of commercial  aviation such as fares, routes, and schedules. The Airline  Deregulation Act of 1978, however, removed many of  these controls, thus changing the face of civil aviation in the  United States. After deregulation, unfettered free competition  ushered in a new era in passenger air travel.  

The CAB had three main functions: to award routes to  airlines, to limit the entry of air carriers into new markets,  and to regulate fares for passengers. Much of the established  practices of commercial passenger travel within the United  States went back to the policies of Walter Folger Brown, the  United States Postmaster General during the administration  of President Herbert Hoover. Brown had changed the mail  payments system to encourage the manufacture of passenger  aircraft instead of mail-carrying aircraft. His influence  was crucial in awarding contracts and helped create four  major domestic airlines: United, American, Eastern, and  Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA). Similarly,  Brown had also helped give Pan American a monopoly on  international routes.  

The push to deregulate, or at least to reform the existing laws  governing passenger carriers, was accelerated by President  Jimmy Carter, who appointed economist and former  professor Alfred Kahn, a vocal supporter of deregulation, to  head the CAB. A second force to deregulate emerged from  abroad. In 1977, Freddie Laker, a British entrepreneur who  owned Laker Airways, created the Skytrain service, which  offered extraordinarily cheap fares for transatlantic flights.  Laker’s offerings coincided with a boom in low-cost domestic  flights as the CAB eased some limitations on charter flights  (i.e., flights offered by companies that do not actually own  planes but leased them from the major airlines). The big air  carriers responded by proposing their own lower fares. For  example, American Airlines, the country’s second largest  airline, obtained CAB approval for “SuperSaver” tickets.  

All of these events proved to be favorable for large-scale  deregulation. In November 1977, Congress formally  deregulated air cargo. In late 1978, Congress passed the  Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, legislation that had been  principally authored by Senators Edward Kennedy and  Howard Cannon.  [Figure 1-11]  There was stiff opposition to  the bill—from the major airlines who feared free competition,  from labor unions who feared non-union employees, and  from safety advocates who feared that safety would be  sacrificed. Public support was, however, strong enough to  pass the act. The act appeased the major airlines by offering  generous subsidies and pleased workers by offering high  unemployment benefits if they lost their jobs as a result. The  most important effect of the act, whose laws were slowly  phased in, was on the passenger market. For the first time  in 40 years, airlines could enter the market or (from 1981)  expand their routes as they saw fit. Airlines (from 1982)  also had full freedom to set their fares. In 1984, the CAB  was finally abolished since its primary duty of regulating the  airline industry was no longer necessary.  

# The Role of the FAA  

# The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  

The FAA is empowered by regulations to promote aviation  safety and establish safety standards for civil aviation. The  FAA achieves these objectives under the Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR), which is the codification of the general  and permanent rules published by the executive departments  and agencies of the United States Government. The  regulations are divided into 50 different codes, called Titles,  that represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation.  FAA regulations are listed under Title 14, “Aeronautics and  Space,” which encompasses all aspects of civil aviation from  how to earn a pilot’s certificate to maintenance of an aircraft.  Title 14 CFR Chapter 1, Federal Aviation Administration,  is broken down into subchapters A through N as illustrated  in  Figure 1-12.  

For the pilot, certain parts of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   are more relevant  than others. During flight training, it is helpful for the pilot  to become familiar with the parts and subparts that relate  

![](images/4fc7235ec6503a30238b7936dd781439c354840a02619aebf37dad13a35c0834.jpg)  
Figure 1-11.   President Jimmy Carter signs the Airline Deregulation  Act in late 1978.  

![Figure 1-12.   Overview of 14 CFR, available online free from the FAA and for purchase through commercial sources. ](images/2cf74bb6281817f769a6e16ab6c1022c9249c55fab8fd738931d41d90a678179.jpg)  

to flight training and pilot certification. For instance, 14  CFR part 61 pertains to the certification of pilots, flight  instructors, and ground instructors. It also defines the  eligibility, aeronautical knowledge, and flight proficiency,  as well as training and testing requirements for each type of  pilot certificate issued. 14 CFR part 91 provides guidance in  the areas of general flight rules, visual flight rules (VFR), and  instrument flight rules (IFR), while 14 CFR part 43 covers  aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance, rebuilding,  and alterations.  

# Primary Locations of the FAA  

The FAA headquarters are in Washington, DC, and there are  nine regional offices strategically located across the United  States. The agency’s two largest field facilities are the Mike  Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) in Oklahoma  City, Oklahoma, and the William J. Hughes Technical  Center (WJHTC) in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Home to  FAA training and logistics services, the MMAC provides  a number of aviation safety-related and business support  services. The WJHTC is the premier aviation research and  development and test and evaluation facility in the country.  The center’s programs include testing and evaluation in ATC,  communication, navigation, airports, aircraft safety, and  security. Furthermore, the WJHTC is active in long-range  development of innovative aviation systems and concepts,  development of new ATC equipment and software, and  modification of existing systems and procedures.  

# Field Offices  

Flight Standards Service  

Within the FAA, the Flight Standards Service promotes safe  air transportation by setting the standards for certification  and oversight of airmen, air operators, air agencies, and  designees. It also promotes safety of flight of civil aircraft  and air commerce by:  

•	 Accomplishing certification, inspection, surveillance,  investigation, and enforcement. •	 Setting regulations and standards. •	 Managing the system for registration of civil aircraft  and all airmen records.  

The focus of interaction between Flight Standards Service  and the aviation community/general public is the Flight  Standards District Office (FSDO).  

Flight Standards District Office (FSDO)  

The FAA has approximately 80 FSDOs.  [Figure 1-13]  These  offices provide information and services for the aviation  community. FSDO phone numbers are listed in the telephone  directory under Government Offices, DOT, FAA. Another  convenient method of finding a local office is to use the  FSDO locator available at: www.faa.gov/about/office_org/ field_offices/fsdo.  

In addition to accident investigation and the enforcement of  aviation regulations, the FSDO is also responsible for the  certification and surveillance of air carriers, air operators,  flight schools/training centers, and airmen including pilots  and flight instructors. Each FSDO is staffed by Aviation  Safety Inspectors (ASIs) who play a key role in making the  nation’s aviation system safe.  

# Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI)  

The ASIs administer and enforce safety regulations and  standards for the production, operation, maintenance, and/ or modification of aircraft used in civil aviation. They also  specialize in conducting inspections of various aspects of the  aviation system, such as aircraft and parts manufacturing,  aircraft operation, aircraft airworthiness, and cabin safety.  ASIs must complete a training program at the FAA Academy  in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which includes airman  evaluation and pilot testing techniques and procedures. ASIs  also receive extensive on-the-job training and recurrent  training on a regular basis. The FAA has approximately  3,700 inspectors located in its FSDO offices. All questions  concerning pilot certification (and/or requests for other  aviation information or services) should be directed to the  local FSDO.  

# FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam)  

The FAA is dedicated to improving the safety of United  States civilian aviation by conveying safety principles and  practices through training, outreach, and education. The FAA  

![](images/d2985c3bece27fcaf279577972df5c03a0fa65e857770cda4e4754dc5ccc1f55.jpg)  
Figure 1-13.   Atlanta Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  

Safety Team (FAASTeam) exemplifies this commitment.  The FAASTeam has replaced the Aviation Safety Program  (ASP), whose education of airmen on all types of safety  subjects successfully reduced accidents. Its success led to  its demise because the easy-to-fix accident causes have been  addressed. To take aviation safety one step further, Flight  Standards Service created the FAASTeam, which is devoted  to reducing aircraft accidents by using a coordinated effort  to focus resources on elusive accident causes.  

Each of the FAA’s nine regions has a Regional FAASTeam  Office dedicated to this new safety program and managed by  the Regional FAASTeam Manager (RFM). The FAASTeam  is “teaming” up with individuals and the aviation industry  to create a unified effort against accidents and tip the safety  culture in the right direction. To learn more about this effort  to improve aviation safety, to take a course at their online  learning center, or to join the FAASTeam, visit their website  at www.faasafety.gov.  

# Obtaining Assistance from the FAA  

Information can be obtained from the FAA by phone,  Internet/e-mail, or mail. To talk to the FAA toll-free 24  hours a day, call 1-866-TELL-FAA (1-866-835-5322). To  visit the FAA’s website, go to www.faa.gov. Individuals can  also e-mail an FAA representative at a local FSDO office by  accessing the staff e-mail address available via the “Contact  FAA” link at the bottom of the FAA home page. Letters can  be sent to:

# FAA Reference Material  

The FAA provides a variety of important reference material  for the student, as well as the advanced civil aviation pilot.  In addition to the regulations provided online by the FAA,  several other publications are available to the user. Almost  all reference material is available online at www.faa.gov in  downloadable format. Commercial aviation publishers also  provide published and online reference material to further  aid the aviation pilot.  

# Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)  

The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) is the official  guide to basic flight information and ATC procedures for the  aviation community flying in the NAS of the United States.  [Figure 1-14]  An international version, containing parallel  information as well as specific information on international  airports, is also available. The AIM also contains information  of interest to pilots, such as health and medical facts, flight

safety, a pilot/controller glossary of terms used in the  system, and information on safety, accidents, and reporting  of hazards. This manual is offered for sale on a subscription  basis or is available online at: http://bookstore.gpo.gov.  

Order forms are provided at the beginning of the manual or  online and should be sent to the Superintendent of Documents,  United States Government Printing Office (GPO). The AIM  is complemented by other operational publications that are  available via separate subscriptions or online.  

# Handbooks  

Handbooks are developed to provide specific information  about a particular topic that enhances training or understanding.  The FAA publishes a variety of handbooks that generally fall  into three categories: aircraft, aviation, and examiners and  inspectors.  [Figure 1-15]  These handbooks can be purchased  from the Superintendent of Documents or downloaded at www. faa.gov/regulations policies. Aviation handbooks are also  published by various commercial aviation companies. Aircraft  flight manuals commonly called Pilot Operating Handbooks  (POH) are documents developed by the airplane manufacturer,  approved by the FAA, and are specific to a particular make  and model aircraft by serial number. This subject is covered  in greater detail in Chapter 8, “Flight Manuals and Other  Documents,” of this handbook.  [Figure 1-16]  

# Advisory Circulars (ACs)  

An AC is an informational document that the FAA wants to  distribute to the aviation community. This can be in the form  

# Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)  

The Aeronautical Information Manual is designed to provide  the aviation community with basic flight information and    ATC procedures for use in the NAS of the United States. It  also contains the fundamentals required in order to fly in the  United States NAS, including items of interest to pilots  concerning health/medical facts, factors affecting flight  safety, etc.  

# Aircraft Flying Handbooks (by category)  

The Aircraft Flying Handbooks are designed as technical  manuals to introduce basic pilot skills and knowledge that  are essential for piloting aircraft. They provide information  on transition to other aircraft and the operation of various  aircraft systems.  

# Aviation Instructor’s Handbook  

The Aviation Instructor’s Handbook provides the foundation  for beginning instructors to understand and apply the  fundamentals of instructing. This handbook also provides  aviation instructors with up-to-date information on learning  and teaching, and how to relate this information to the task  of conveying aeronautical knowledge and skills to students.  Experienced aviation instructors also find the new and  updated information useful for improving their effectiveness  in training activities.  

# Instrument Flying Handbook  

The Instrument Flying Handbook is designed for use by  instrument flight instructors and pilots preparing for  instrument rating tests. Instructors find this handbook a  valuable training aid as it includes basic reference material  for knowledge testing and instrument flight training.  

# Instrument Procedures Handbook  

The Instrument Procedures Handbook is designed as a  technical reference for professional pilots who operate  under IFR in the NAS and expands on information contained  in the Instrument Flying Handbook.

of a text book used in a classroom or a one page document.  Some ACs are free while others cost money. They are to  be used for information only and are not regulations. The  FAA website www.faa.gov/regulations policies/advisory_ circulars/ provides a database that is a searchable repository  of all aviation safety ACs. All ACs, current and historical,  are provided and can be viewed as a portable document  format (PDF) copy.  

ACs provide a single, uniform, agency-wide system that the  FAA uses to deliver advisory material to FAA customers,  industry, the aviation community, and the public. An AC  may be needed to:  

•	 Provide an acceptable, clearly understood method for  complying with a regulation  

![](images/320e99f5128ba43eb88a5f9272f289bde2710472ac33b456dbd011cedc0922c1.jpg)  
Figure 1-16.   Pilot Operating Handbooks from manufacturers.  

•	 Standardize implementation of a regulation or  harmonize implementation for the international  aviation community •	 Resolve a general misunderstanding of a regulation •	 Respond to a request from some government entity,  such as General Accounting Office, NTSB, or the  Office of the Inspector General •	 Help the industry and FAA effectively implement a  regulation •	 Explain requirements and limits of an FAA grant  program •	 Expand on standards needed to promote aviation  safety, including the safe operation of airports  

There are three parts to an AC number, as in 25-42C. The  first part of the number identifies the subject matter area  of the AC and corresponds to the appropriate 14 CFR part.  For example, an AC on “Certification: Pilots and Flight and  Ground Instructors” is numbered as AC 61-65E. Since ACs  are numbered sequentially within each subject area, the  second part of the number beginning with the dash identifies  this sequence. The third part of the number is a letter assigned  by the originating office and shows the revision sequence if  an AC is revised. The first version of an AC does not have  a revision letter. In  Figure 1-17 , this is the fifth revision, as  designated by the “E.”  

# Flight Publications  

The FAA, in concert with other government agencies,  orchestrates the publication and changes to publications  that are key to safe flight.  Figure 1-18  illustrates some  publications a pilot may use.  

![](images/222889eabb0693afcbd2e93f21d257ebadfb142f034c72c6ca5f8b8f1c6fdd5a.jpg)

# Pilot and Aeronautical Information  Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)  

Notices to Airmen, or NOTAMs, are time-critical aeronautical  information either temporary in nature or not sufficiently  known in advance to permit publication on aeronautical  charts or in other operational publications. The information  receives immediate dissemination via the National Notice to  Airmen (NOTAM) System. NOTAMs contain current notices  to airmen that are considered essential to the safety of flight,  as well as supplemental data affecting other operational  publications. There are many different reasons that NOTAMs  are issued. Following are some of those reasons:  

•	 Hazards, such as air shows, parachute jumps, kite  flying, and rocket launches •	 Flights by important people such as heads of state •	 Closed runways  •	 Inoperable radio navigational aids  •	 Military exercises with resulting airspace restrictions  •	 Inoperable lights on tall obstructions  •	 Temporary erection of obstacles near airfields  •	 Passage of flocks of birds through airspace (a NOTAM  in this category is known as a BIRDTAM)  •	 Notifications of runway/taxiway/apron status with  respect to snow, ice, and standing water (a SNOWTAM)  

•	 Notification of an operationally significant change in  volcanic ash or other dust contamination (an ASHTAM)  •	 Software code risk announcements with associated  patches to reduce specific vulnerabilities  

NOTAM information is generally classified into four  categories: NOTAM (D) or NOTAMs that receive distant  dissemination, distant and Flight Data Center (FDC)  NOTAMs, Pointer NOTAMs, and Military NOTAMs  pertaining to military airports or NAVAIDs that are part of the  NAS. NOTAMs are available through Flight Service Station  (FSS), Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS),  private vendors, and many online websites.  

# NOTAM  $(D)$   Information  

NOTAM (D) information is disseminated for all navigational  facilities that are part of the NAS, and all public use airports,  seaplane bases, and heliports listed in the Chart Supplement  U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory). NOTAM (D)  information now includes such data as taxiway closures,  personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and  airport lighting aids that do not affect instrument approach  criteria, such as visual approach slope indicator (VASI).  All D NOTAMs are required to have one of the following  keywords as the first part of the text: RWY, TWY, RAMP,  APRON, AD, OBST, NAV, COM, SVC, AIRSPACE, (U),  or (O).  [Figure 1-19]  

FDC NOTAMs  

FDC NOTAMs are issued by the National Flight Data  Center and contain information that is regulatory in nature  pertaining to flight including, but not limited to, changes  to charts, procedures, and airspace usage. FDC NOTAMs  refer to information that is regulatory in nature and includes  the following:  

•	 Interim IFR flight procedures:  1.	 Airway structure changes  2.	 Instrument approach procedure changes (excludes  Departure Procedures (DPs) and Standard  Terminal Arrivals (STARs)  3.	 Airspace changes in general  4.	 Special instrument approach procedure changes  •	 Temporary flight restrictions (discussed in Chapter 15):  1.	 Disaster areas  2.	 Special events generating a high degree of interest  3.	 Hijacking  

•	 Flight restrictions in the proximity of the President  and other parties  •	 14 CFR part 139 certificated airport condition changes •	 Snow conditions affecting glide slope operation  •	 Air defense emergencies  •	 Emergency flight rules  •	 Substitute airway routes  •	 Special data  •	 U.S. Government charting corrections  •	 Laser activity  

NOTAMs contain the elements below from left to right in  the following order:  

•	 An exclamation point (!) •	 Accountability Location (the identifier of the  accountability location)  

![Figure 1-19.   NOTAM  $(D)$   Information.  ](images/5c914ae40edcbee7bbd4bad614d16259b5d8f29828097a38f8b574144d0c9b27.jpg)  

•	 Affected Location (the identifier of the affected facility  or location)  •	 KEYWORD (one of the following: RWY, TWY,  RAMP, APRON, AD, COM, NAV, SVC, OBST,  AIRSPACE, (U) and (O))  •	 Surface Identification (optional—this shall be the  runway identification for runway related NOTAMs,  the taxiway identification for taxiway-related  NOTAMs, or the ramp/apron identification for ramp/ apron-related NOTAMs)  •	 Condition (the condition being reported)   •	 Time (identifies the effective time(s) of the NOTAM  condition)  

Altitude and height are in feet mean sea level (MSL) up to  17,999; e.g., 275, 1225 (feet and MSL is not written), and in  flight levels (FL) for 18,000 and above; e.g., FL180, FL550.  When MSL is not known, above ground level (AGL) will be  written (304 AGL).  

When time is expressed in a NOTAM, the day begins at 0000  and ends at 2359. Times used in the NOTAM system are  universal time coordinated (UTC) and shall be stated in 10  digits (year, month, day, hour, and minute). The following  are two examples of how the time would be presented:  

!DCA LDN NAV VOR OTS WEF 0708051600-0708052359  

!DCA LDN NAV VOR OTS WEF 0709050000-0709050400  

NOTAM Dissemination and Availability  

The system for disseminating aeronautical information is  made up of two subsystems: the Airmen's Information System  (AIS) and the NOTAM System. The AIS consists of charts and  publications and is disseminated by the following methods:  

Aeronautical charts depicting permanent baseline data:  

•	 IFR Charts—Enroute High Altitude Conterminous  U.S.,  Enroute Low Altitude Conterminous U.S., Alaska  Charts, and Pacific Charts  •	 U.S. Terminal Procedures—Departure Procedures  (DPs), Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs) and  Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) •	 VFR Charts—Sectional Aeronautical Charts, Terminal  Area Charts (TAC), and World Aeronautical Charts  (WAC)  

Flight information publications outlining baseline data:  

•	 Notices to Airmen (NTAP)—Published by System  Operations Services, System Operations and Safety,  Publications, every 28 days) •	 Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility  Directory) •	 Pacific Chart Supplement •	 Alaska Supplement  •	 Alaska Terminal •	 Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)  

NOTAMs are available in printed form through subscription  from the Superintendent of Documents, from an FSS, or  online at PilotWeb (www.pilotweb.nas.faa.gov), which  provides access to current NOTAM information. Local  airport NOTAMs can be obtained online from various  websites. Some examples are www.fltplan.com and www. aopa.org/whatsnew/notams.html. Most sites require a free  registration and acceptance of terms but offer pilots updated  NOTAMs and TFRs.  

Safety Program Airmen Notification System (SPANS) In 2004, the FAA launched the Safety Program Airmen  Notification System (SPANS), an online event notification  system that provides timely and easy-to-assess seminar  and event information notification for airmen. The SPANS  system is taking the place of the current paper-based mail  system. This provides better service to airmen while reducing  costs for the FAA. Anyone can search the SPANS system  and register for events. To read more about SPANS, visit  www.faasafety.gov/spans.  

# Aircraft Classifications and Ultralight  Vehicles  

The FAA uses various ways to classify or group machines  operated or flown in the air. The most general grouping uses  the term aircraft. This term is in 14 CFR 1.1 and means a  device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air.  

Ultralight vehicle is another general term the FAA uses.  This term is defined in 14 CFR 103. As the term implies,  powered ultralight vehicles must weigh less than 254 pounds  empty weight and unpowered ultralight vehicles must  weigh less than 155 pounds. Rules for ultralight vehicles  are significantly different from rules for aircraft; ultralight  vehicle certification, registration, and operation rules are also  contained in 14 CFR 103.  

The FAA differentiates aircraft by their characteristics and  physical properties. Key groupings defined in 14 CFR 1.1  include:  

•	 Airplane—an engine-driven fixed-wing aircraft  heavier than air, that is supported in flight by the  dynamic reaction of the air against its wings. •	 Glider—a heavier-than-air aircraft, that is supported  in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its  lifting surfaces and whose free flight does not depend  principally on an engine.  •	 Lighter-than-air aircraft—an aircraft that can rise and  remain suspended by using contained gas weighing  less than the air that is displaced by the gas. -	 Airship—an engine-driven lighter-than-air  aircraft that can be steered.  -	 Balloon—a lighter-than-air aircraft that is not  engine driven, and that sustains flight through the  use of either gas buoyancy or an airborne heater. •	 Powered-lift—a heavier-than-air aircraft capable of  vertical takeoff, vertical landing, and low speed flight  that depends principally on engine-driven lift devices  or engine thrust for lift during these flight regimes and  on nonrotating airfoil(s) for lift during horizontal flight. •	 Powered parachute—a powered aircraft comprised of  a flexible or semi-rigid wing connected to a fuselage  so that the wing is not in position for flight until  the aircraft is in motion. The fuselage of a powered  parachute contains the aircraft engine, a seat for each  occupant and Is attached to the aircraft's landing gear. •	 Rocket—an aircraft propelled by ejected expanding  gases generated in the engine from self-contained  propellants and not dependent on the intake of outside  substances. It includes any part which becomes  separated during the operation.  •	 Rotorcraft—a heavier-than-air aircraft that depends  principally for its support in flight on the lift generated  by one or more rotors.  -	 Gyroplane—a rotorcraft whose rotors are not  engine-driven, except for Initial starting, but  are made to rotate by action of the air when  the rotorcraft Is moving; and whose means of  propulsion, consisting usually of conventional  propellers, is Independent of the rotor system.  -	 Helicopter—a rotorcraft that, for its horizontal  motion, depends principally on its engine-driven  rotors. •	 Weight-shift-control—a powered aircraft with a framed  pivoting wing and a fuselage controllable only in pitch  and roll by the pilot's ability to change the aircraft’s  

center of gravity with respect to the wing. Flight control  of the aircraft depends on the wing's ability to flexibly  deform rather than the use of control surfaces.  

Size and weight are other methods used in 14 CFR 1.1 to  group aircraft:  

•	 Large aircraft—an aircraft of more than 12,500  pounds, maximum certificated takeoff weight. •	 Light-sport aircraft (LSA)—an aircraft, other than  a helicopter or powered-lift that, since its original  certification, has continued to meet the definition in  14 CFR 1.1. (LSA can include airplanes, airships,  balloons, gliders, gyro planes, powered parachutes,  and weight-shift-control.) •	 Small Aircraft—aircraft of 12,500 pounds or less,  maximum certificated takeoff weight.  

We also use broad classifications of aircraft with respect to  the certification of airmen or with respect to the certification  of the aircraft themselves. See the next section, Pilot  Certifications, and Chapter 3, for further discussion of  certification. These definitions are in 14 CFR 1.1:  

Category 1. 	 As used with respect to the certification, ratings,  privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a  broad classification of aircraft. Examples include:  airplane; rotorcraft; glider; and lighter-than-air;  and 2. 	 As used with respect to the certification of  aircraft, means a grouping of aircraft based upon  intended use or operating limitations. Examples  include: transport, normal, utility, acrobatic,  limited, restricted, and provisional. Class 1. 	 As used with respect to the certification, ratings,  privileges, and limitations of airmen, means a  classification of aircraft within a category having  similar operating characteristics. Examples  Include: single engine; multiengine; land; water;  gyroplane, helicopter, airship, and free balloon;  and 2. 	 As used with respect to the certification of  aircraft, means a broad grouping of aircraft having  similar characteristics of propulsion, flight, or  landing. Examples include: airplane, rotorcraft,  gilder, balloon, landplane, and seaplane. Type 1. 	 As used with respect to the certification, ratings,  privileges, and limitations of airmen, means  

a specific make and basic model of aircraft,  Including modifications thereto that do not  change its handling or flight characteristics.  Examples include: 737-700, G-IV, and 1900; and  2. 	 As used with respect to the certification of  aircraft, means those aircraft which are similar  in design. Examples include: 737-700 and 737- 700C; G-IV and G-IV-X; and 1900 and 1900C.  

This system of definitions allows the FAA to group and  regulate aircraft to provide for their safe operation.  

# Pilot Certifications  

The type of intended flying influences what type of pilot’s  certificate is required. Eligibility, training, experience,  and testing requirements differ depending on the type of  certificates sought.  [Figure 1-20]  Each type of pilot’s  certificate has privileges and limitations that are inherent  within the certificate itself. However, other privileges and  limitations may be applicable based on the aircraft type,  operation being conducted, and the type of certificate.  For example, a certain certificate may have privileges and  limitations under 14 CFR part 61 and part 91.  

![](images/464e0aef8891b1b2171fd94d310a31d622c7818c3355398c6c1bd4bdd7e0c3bf.jpg)

Figure 1-20.   Front side (top) and back side (bottom) of an airman  certificate issued by the FAA.  

•	 Privileges—define where and when the pilot may fly,  with whom they may fly, the purpose of the flight, and  the type of aircraft they are allowed to fly.  •	 Limitations—the FAA may impose limitations on a  pilot certificate if, during training or the practical test,  the pilot does not demonstrate all skills necessary to  exercise all privileges of a privilege level, category,  class, or type rating.  

Endorsements, a form of authorization, are written to establish  that the certificate holder has received training in specific skill  areas. Endorsements are written and signed by an authorized  individual, usually a certificated flight instructor (CFI), and  are based on aircraft classification.  [Figure 1-21]  

# Sport Pilot  

To become a sport pilot, the student pilot is required to have  flown, at a minimum, the following hours depending upon  the aircraft:  

•	 Airplane: 20 hours •	 Powered Parachute: 12 hours  •	 Weight-Shift Control (Trikes): 20 hours  •	 Glider: 10 hours  •	 Rotorcraft (gyroplane only): 20 hours  •	 Lighter-Than-Air: 20 hours (airship) or 7 hours  (balloon)  

To earn a Sport Pilot Certificate, one must:  

•	 Be at least 16 years old to become a student sport pilot  (14 years old for gliders or balloons)  •	 Be at least 17 years old to test for a sport pilot  certificate (16 years old for gliders or balloons) •	 Be able to read, write, and understand the English  language  •	 Hold a current and valid driver’s license as evidence  of medical eligibility  

When operating as a sport pilot, some of the following  privileges and limitations may apply.  

# Privileges:  

•	 Operate as pilot in command (PIC) of a light-sport  aircraft •	 Carry a passenger and share expenses (fuel, oil, airport  expenses, and aircraft rental) •	 Fly during the daytime using VFR, a minimum of  3 statute miles visibility and visual contact with the  ground are required  

Recreational pilot to conduct solo flights for the purpose of obtaining an additional certificate or rating while under  the supervision of an authorized flight instructor: section 61.101(i).  

I certify that (First name, MI, Last name) has received the required training of section 61.87 in a (make and model  aircraft). I have determined he/she is prepared to conduct a solo flight on (date) under the following conditions: (List  all conditions which require endorsement, e.g., flight which requires communication with air traffic control, flight in an  aircraft for which the pilot does not hold a category/class rating, etc.).  

# Limitations:  

•	 Prohibited from flying in Class A airspace  •	 Prohibited from flying in Class B, C, or D airspace  until you receive training and a logbook endorsement  from an instructor •	 No flights outside the United States without prior  permission from the foreign aviation authority  •	 May not tow any object  •	 No flights while carrying a passenger or property for  compensation or hire  •	 Prohibited from flying in furtherance of a business  

The sport pilot certificate does not list aircraft category  and class ratings. After successfully passing the practical  test for a sport pilot certificate, regardless of the light-sport  aircraft privileges you seek, the FAA will issue you a sport  pilot certificate without any category and class ratings. The  Instructor will provide you with the appropriate logbook  endorsement for the category and class of aircraft in which  you are authorized to act as pilot in command.  

# Recreational Pilot  

To become a recreational pilot, one must:  

•	 Be at least 17 years old  •	 Be able to read, write, speak, and understand the  English language  •	 Pass the required knowledge test  •	 Meet the aeronautical experience requirements in  either a single-engine airplane, a helicopter, or a  gyroplane. •	 Obtain a logbook endorsement from an instructor  •	 Pass the required practical test  •	 Obtain a third-class medical certificate issued under  14 CFR part 67  

As a recreational pilot, cross-country flight is limited to a 50  NM range from the departure airport but is permitted with  additional training per 14 CFR part 61, section 61.101(c).  Additionally, recreational pilots are restricted from flying  at night and flying in airspace where communications with  ATC are required.  

The minimum aeronautical experience requirements for a  recreational pilot license involve:  

•	 30 hours of flight time including at least:  •	 15 hours of dual instruction  •	 2 hours of en route training  •	 3 hours in preparation for the practical test  •	 3 hours of solo flight  

When operating as a recreational pilot, some of the following  privileges and limitations may apply.  

# Privileges:  

•	 Carry no more than one passenger; •	 Not pay less than the pro rata share of the operating  expenses of a flight with a passenger, provided the  expenses involve only fuel, oil, airport expenses, or  aircraft rental fees  

# Limitations:  

•	 A recreational pilot may not act as PIC of an aircraft  that is certificated for more than four occupants or has  more than one powerplant.  

# Private Pilot  

A private pilot is one who flies for pleasure or personal  business without accepting compensation for flying except  in some very limited, specific circumstances. The Private  Pilot Certificate is the certificate held by the majority of  active pilots. It allows command of any aircraft (subject  to appropriate ratings) for any noncommercial purpose  and gives almost unlimited authority to fly under VFR.  Passengers may be carried and flight in furtherance of a  business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be  compensated in any way for services as a pilot, although  passengers can pay a pro rata share of flight expenses, such  as fuel or rental costs. If training under 14 CFR part 61,  experience requirements include at least 40 hours of piloting  time, including 20 hours of flight with an instructor and 10  hours of solo flight.  [Figure 1-22]  

# Commercial Pilot  

A commercial pilot may be compensated for flying. Training  for the certificate focuses on a better understanding of  aircraft systems and a higher standard of airmanship. The  Commercial Pilot Certificate itself does not allow a pilot  to fly in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and  commercial pilots without an instrument rating are restricted  to daytime flight within  $50\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   when flying for hire.  

A commercial airplane pilot must be able to operate  a complex airplane, as a specific number of hours of  complex (or turbine-powered) aircraft time are among  the prerequisites, and at least a portion of the practical  examination is performed in a complex aircraft. A complex  aircraft must have retractable landing gear, movable flaps,  and a controllable-pitch propeller. See 14 CFR part 61,  section 61.31(e) for additional information.  [Figure 1-23]  

# Airline Transport Pilot  

The airline transport pilot (ATP) is tested to the highest level  of piloting ability. The ATP certificate is a prerequisite for  serving as a PIC and second in command (SIC) of scheduled  airline operations. It is also a prerequisite for serving as a PIC  in select charter and fractional operations. The minimum pilot  experience is 1,500 hours of flight time. In addition, the pilot  must be at least 23 years of age, be able to read, write, speak,  

![](images/d712577ac530a2d9957850eccbfe3c6084c4db54cfca82826b5e07ca50aa3b75.jpg)

and understand the English language, and be “of good moral  standing.” A pilot may obtain an ATP certificate with restricted  privileges enabling him/her to serve as an SIC in scheduled  airline operations. The minimum pilot experience is reduced  based upon specific academic and flight training experience.  The minimum age to be eligible is 21 years.  [Figure 1-24]  

# Selecting a Flight School  

Selecting a flight school is an important consideration in  the flight training process. FAA-approved training centers,  FAA-approved pilot schools, noncertificated flying schools,  and independent flight instructors conduct flight training in  the United States. All flight training is conducted under the  auspices of the FAA following the regulations outlined in  14 CFR parts 142, 141, or 61. Training centers, also referred  to as flight academies, operate under 14 CFR part 142 and  are certificated by the FAA. Application for certification  is voluntary and the training center must meet stringent  requirements for personnel, equipment, maintenance,  facilities, and must teach a curriculum approved by the  FAA. Training centers typically utilize a number of flight  simulation training devices as part of its curricula. Flight  training conducted at a training center is primarily done  under contract to airlines and other commercial operators  in transport or turbine aircraft, however many also provide  

![](images/86c269730bc38248d3d690065ffb81ddb228faaa06235efd6f9407c9eaf081f4.jpg)  
Figure 1-24.   Type of aircraft flown by an airline transport pilot.  

flight training for the private pilot certificate, commercial  pilot certificate, instrument rating, and ATP certificate.  

Flight schools operating under 14 CFR part 141 are  certificated by the FAA. Application for certification is  voluntary and the school must meet stringent requirements  for personnel, equipment, maintenance, facilities, and must  teach an established curriculum, which includes a training  course outline (TCO) approved by the FAA. The certificated  schools may qualify for a ground school rating and a flight  school rating. In addition, the school may be authorized  to give its graduates practical (flight) tests and knowledge  (computer administered written) tests. The FAA Pilot School  Search database located at http://av-info.faa.gov/PilotSchool. asp, lists certificated ground and flight schools and the pilot  training courses each school offers.  

Enrollment in a 14 CFR part 141 flight school ensures  quality, continuity, and offers a structured approach to flight  training because these facilities must document the training  curriculum and have their flight courses approved by the  FAA. These strictures allow 14 CFR part 141 schools to  complete certificates and ratings in fewer flight hours, which  can mean a savings on the cost of flight training for the  student pilot. For example, the minimum requirement for a  Private Pilot Certificate is 35 hours in a part 141-certificated  school and 40 hours in a part 61-certificated school. (This  difference may be insignificant for a Private Pilot Certificate  because the national average indicates most pilots require 60  to 75 hours of flight training.)  

Many excellent flight schools find it impractical to qualify  for the FAA part 141 certificates and are referred to as part  61 schools. 14 CFR part 61 outlines certificate and rating  requirements for pilot certification through noncertificated  schools and individual flight instructors. It also states what  knowledge-based training must be covered and how much  flight experience is required for each certificate and rating.  Flight schools and flight instructors who train must adhere  to the statutory requirements and train pilots to the standards  found in 14 CFR part 61.  

One advantage of flight training under 14 CFR part 61 is its  flexibility. Flight lessons can be tailored to the individual  student, because 14 CFR part 61 dictates the required  minimum flight experience and knowledge-based training  necessary to gain a specific pilot’s license, but it does not  stipulate how the training is to be organized. This flexibility  can also be a disadvantage because a flight instructor who  fails to organize the flight training can cost a student pilot  time and expense through repetitious training. One way for  a student pilot to avoid this problem is to ensure the flight  instructor has a well-documented training syllabus.  

# How To Find a Reputable Flight Program  

To obtain information about pilot training, contact the local  FSDO, which maintains a current file on all schools within its  district. The choice of a flight school depends on what type of  certificate is sought, and whether an individual wishes to fly  as a sport pilot or wishes to pursue a career as a professional  pilot. Another consideration is the amount of time that can  be devoted to training. Ground and flight training should  be obtained as regularly and frequently as possible because  this assures maximum retention of instruction and the  achievement of requisite proficiency.  

Do not make the determination based on financial concerns  alone, because the quality of training is very important.  Prior to making a final decision, visit the schools under  consideration and talk with management, instructors, and  students. Request a personal tour of the flight school facility.  

Be inquisitive and proactive when searching for a flight  school, do some homework, and develop a checklist of  questions by talking to pilots and reading articles in flight  magazines. The checklist should include questions about  aircraft reliability and maintenance practices, and questions  for current students such as whether or not there is a safe,  clean aircraft available when they are scheduled to fly.  

Questions for the training facility should be aimed at  determining if the instruction fits available personal time.  What are the school’s operating hours? Does the facility have  dedicated classrooms available for ground training required  by the FAA? Is there an area available for preflight briefings,  postflight debriefings, and critiques? Are these rooms private  in nature in order to provide a nonthreatening environment  in which the instructor can explain the content and outcome  of the flight without making the student feel self-conscious?  

Examine the facility before committing to any flight training.  Evaluate the answers on the checklist, and then take time to  think things over before making a decision. This proactive  approach to choosing a flight school will ensure a student  pilot contracts with a flight school or flight instructor best  suited to their individual needs.  

# How To Choose a Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI)  

Whether an individual chooses to train under 14 CFR part  141 or part 61, the key to an effective flight program is the  quality of the ground and flight training received from the  CFI. The flight instructor assumes total responsibility for  training an individual to meet the standards required for  certification within an ever-changing operating environment.  A CFI should possess an understanding of the learning  process, knowledge of the fundamentals of teaching, and  the ability to communicate effectively with the student pilot.  During the certification process, a flight instructor applicant  is tested on the practical application of these skills in specific  teaching situations. The flight instructor is crucial to the  scenario-based training program endorsed by the FAA. He  or she is trained to function in the learning environment as an  advisor and guide for the learner. The duties, responsibilities,  and authority of the CFI include the following:  

•	 Orient the student to the scenario-based training  system •	 Help the student become a confident planner and  inflight manager of each flight and a critical evaluator  of their own performance •	 Help the student understand the knowledge  requirements present in real world applications  •	 Diagnose learning difficulties and help the student  overcome them  •	 Evaluate student progress and maintain appropriate  records •	 Provide continuous review of student learning  

Should a student pilot find the selected CFI is not training in  a manner conducive for learning, or the student and CFI do  not have compatible schedules, the student pilot should find  another CFI. Choosing the right CFI is important because the  quality of instruction and the knowledge and skills acquired  from their flight instructor affect a student pilot’s entire  flying career.  

# The Student Pilot  

The first step in becoming a pilot is to select a type of aircraft.  FAA rules for obtaining a pilot’s certificate differ depending  on the type of aircraft flown. Individuals can choose among  airplanes, gyroplanes, weight-shift, helicopters, powered  parachutes, gliders, balloons, or airships. A pilot does not  need a certificate to fly ultralight vehicles.  

# Basic Requirements  

A student pilot is one who is being trained by an instructor  pilot for his or her first full certificate, and is permitted  to fly alone (solo) under specific, limited circumstances.  Before a student pilot may be endorsed to fly solo, that  student must have a Student Pilot Certificate. There are  multiple ways that an aspiring pilot can obtain their Student  Pilot Certificate. The application may be processed by an  FAA inspector or technician, an FAA-Designated Pilot  Examiner, a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI), or an Airman  Certification Representative (ACR). If the application is  completed electronically, the authorized person will submit  the application to the FAA’s Airman Certification Branch  (AFS-760) in Oklahoma City, OK, via the Integrated  Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA). If  the application is completed on paper, it must be sent to  the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), who will  forward it to AFS-760. Once the application is processed, the  applicant will receive the Student Pilot Certificate by mail at  the address provided on the application.  

The aforementioned process will become effective on April  1, 2016. The new certificate will be printed on a plastic card,  which will replace the paper certificate that was issued in the  past. The plastic card certificate will not have an expiration  date. Paper certificates issued prior to the new process will  still expire according to the date on the certificate; however,  under the new process, paper certificates cannot be renewed.  Once the paper certificate expires, the Student Pilot must  submit a new application under the new process. Another  significant change in the new process is that flight instructors  will now make endorsements for solo privileges in the  Student Pilot’s logbook, instead of endorsing the Student  Pilot Certificate.  

To be eligible for a Student Pilot Certificate, the applicant  must:  

•	 Be at least 16 years of age (14 years of age to pilot a  glider or balloon). •	 Be able to read, speak, write, and understand the  English language.  

# Medical Certification Requirements  

The second step in becoming a pilot is to obtain a medical  certificate (if the choice of aircraft is an airplane, helicopter,  gyroplane, or an airship).   (The FAA suggests the individual  get a medical certificate before beginning flight training to  avoid the expense of flight training that cannot be continued  due to a medical condition.) Balloon or glider pilots do not  need a medical certificate, but do need to write a statement  certifying that no medical defect exists that would prevent  them from piloting a balloon or glider. The new sport pilot  category does not require a medical examination; a driver’s  license can be used as proof of medical competence.  Applicants who fail to meet certain requirements or who  have physical disabilities which might limit, but not  prevent, their acting as pilots, should contact the nearest  FAA office. Anyone requesting an FAA Medical Clearance,  Medical Certificate, or Student Pilot Medical Certificate can  electronically complete an application through the FAA’s  MedXPress system available at https://medxpress.faa.gov/.  

A medical certificate is obtained by passing a physical  examination administered by a doctor who is an FAA- authorized AME. There are approximately 6,000  FAA-authorized AMEs in the nation. To find an AME near  you, go to the FAA’s AME locator at www.faa.gov/pilots/ amelocator/. Medical certificates are designated as first class,  second class, or third class. Generally, first class is designed  for the airline transport pilot; second class for the commercial  pilot; and third class for the student, recreational, and private  pilot. A Student Pilot Certificate can be processed by an FAA  inspector or technician, an FAA Designated pilot examiner  (DPE), an Airman Certification Representative (ACR), or a  Certified Flight Instructor (CFI). This certificate allows an  individual who is being trained by a flight instructor to fly  alone (solo) under specific, limited circumstances and must  be carried with the student pilot while exercising solo flight  privileges. The Student Pilot Certificate is only required  when exercising solo flight privileges. The new plastic  student certificate does not have an expiration date. For  airmen who were issued a paper certificate, that certificate  will remain valid until its expiration date. A paper certificate  cannot be renewed. When the paper certificate expires, a new  application must be completed via the IACRA system, and  a new plastic certificate will be issued.  

# Student Pilot Solo Requirements  

Once a student has accrued sufficient training and experience,  a CFI can endorse the student’s logbook to authorize limited  solo flight in a specific type (make and model) of aircraft.  A student pilot may not carry passengers, fly in furtherance  of a business, or operate an aircraft outside of the various  endorsements provided by the flight instructor. There is no  minimum aeronautical knowledge or experience requirement  for the issuance of a Student Pilot Certificate, however, the  applicant must be at least 16 years of age (14 years of age for  a pilot for glider or balloon), and they must be able to read,  speak, write and understand the English language. There are,  however, minimum aeronautical knowledge and experience  requirements for student pilots to solo.  

# Becoming a Pilot  

The course of instruction a student pilot follows depends on  the type of certificate sought. It should include the ground and  flight training necessary to acquire the knowledge and skills  required to safely and efficiently function as a certificated  pilot in the selected category and class of aircraft. The  specific knowledge and skill areas for each category and  class of aircraft are outlined in 14 CFR part 61. Eligibility,  aeronautical knowledge, proficiency, and aeronautical  requirements can be found in 14 CFR part 61.  

•	 Recreational Pilot, see subpart D •	 Private Pilot, see subpart E •	 Sport Pilot, see subpart J  

of training and testing materials which are available in print  form from the Superintendent of Documents, GPO, and  online at the Regulatory Support Division: www.faa.gov/ about/office_org/headquarters offices/avs/offices/afs/afs600.  

The CFI may also use commercial publications as a source  of study materials, especially for aircraft categories where  government materials are limited. A student pilot should  follow the flight instructor’s advice on what and when to  study. Planning a definite study program and following it as  closely as possible will help in scoring well on the knowledge  test. Haphazard or disorganized study habits usually result  in an unsatisfactory score.  

In addition to learning aeronautical knowledge, such as the  principles of flight, a student pilot is also required to gain  skill in flight maneuvers. The selected category and class of  aircraft determines the type of flight skills and number of  flight hours to be obtained. There are four steps involved in  learning a flight maneuver:  

•	 The CFI introduces and demonstrates flight maneuver  to the student. •	 The CFI talks the student pilot through the maneuver. •	 The student pilot practices the maneuver under CFI  supervision. •	 The CFI authorizes the student pilot to practice the  maneuver solo.  

Once the student pilot has shown proficiency in the required  knowledge areas, flight maneuvers, and accrued the required  amount of flight hours, the CFI endorses the student pilot  logbook, which allows the student pilot to take the written  and practical tests for pilot certification.  

# Knowledge and Skill Tests  

# Knowledge Tests  

The knowledge test is the computer portion of the tests taken  to obtain pilot certification. The test contains questions of  the objective, multiple-choice type. This testing method  conserves the applicant's time, eliminates any element of  individual judgment in determining grades, and saves time  in scoring.  

FAA Airman Knowledge Test Guides for every type of pilot  certificate address most questions you may have regarding  the knowledge test process. The guides are available on- line (free of charge) at http://www.faa.gov/training testing/ testing/test_guides/.  

The knowledge-based portion of training is obtained through  FAA handbooks such as this one, textbooks, and other sources  

# When To Take the Knowledge Test  

The knowledge test is more meaningful to the applicant  and more likely to result in a satisfactory grade if it is taken  after beginning the flight portion of the training. Therefore,  the FAA recommends the knowledge test be taken after the  student pilot has completed a solo cross-country flight. The  operational knowledge gained by this experience can be used  to the student’s advantage in the knowledge test. The student  pilot’s CFI is the best person to determine when the applicant  is ready to take the knowledge test.  

# Practical Test  

The FAA has developed PTS for FAA pilot certificates  and associated ratings.  [Figure 1-25]  In 2015, the FAA  began transitioning to the ACS approach. The ACS is  essentially an “enhanced” version of the PTS. It adds task- specific knowledge and risk management elements to each  PTS Area of Operation and Task. The result is a holistic,  integrated presentation of specific knowledge, skills, and  risk management elements and performance metrics for each  Area of Operation and Task The ACS evaluation program  will eventually replace the PTS program for evaluating and  certifying pilots.  

The practical tests are administered by FAA ASIs and DPEs.  Title 14 CFR part 61 specifies the areas of operation in which  knowledge and skill must be demonstrated by the applicant.  Since the FAA requires all practical tests be conducted in  accordance with the appropriate PTS and the policies set forth  in the Introduction section of the PTS book. The pilot applicant  should become familiar with this book during training.  

The PTS book is a testing document and not intended to be  a training syllabus. An appropriately-rated flight instructor  is responsible for training the pilot applicant to acceptable  standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and  maneuvers. Descriptions of tasks and information on how to  perform maneuvers and procedures are contained in reference  and teaching documents such as this handbook. A list of  reference documents is contained in the Introduction section  of each PTS book. Copies may obtained by:  

•	 Downloading from the FAA website at www.faa.gov •	 Purchasing print copies from the GPO, Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, or via their official online bookstore  at www.access.gpo.gov  

The flight proficiency maneuvers listed in 14 CFR part 61  are the standard skill requirements for certification. They  are outlined in the PTS as “areas of operation.” These are  phases of the practical test arranged in a logical sequence  within the standard. They begin with preflight preparation  and end with postflight procedures. Each area of operation

contains “tasks,” which are comprised of knowledge areas,  flight procedures, and/or flight maneuvers appropriate to the  area of operation. The candidate is required to demonstrate  knowledge and proficiency in all tasks for the original  issuance of all pilot certificates.  

# When To Take the Practical Test  

14 CFR part 61 establishes the ground school and flight  experience requirements for the type of certification and  aircraft selected. However, the CFI best determines when an  applicant is qualified for the practical test. A practice practical  test is an important step in the flight training process.  

The applicant will be asked to present the following  documentation:  

•	 FAA Form 8710-1 (8710.11 for sport pilot applicants),  Application for an Airman Certificate and/or Rating,  with the flight instructor’s recommendation •	 An Airman Knowledge Test Report with a  satisfactory grade •	 A medical certificate (not required for glider or  balloon), a Student Pilot Certificate, and a pilot  logbook endorsed by a flight instructor for solo, solo  cross-country (airplane and rotorcraft), and for the  make and model aircraft to be used for the practical  test (driver’s license or medical certificate for sport  pilot applicants) •	 The pilot log book records •	 A graduation certificate from an FAA-approved school  (if applicable)  

The applicant must provide an airworthy aircraft with  equipment relevant to the areas of operation required for  the practical test. He or she will also be asked to produce  and explain the:  

•	 Aircraft’s registration certificate •	 Aircraft’s airworthiness certificate •	 Aircraft’s operating limitations or FAA-approved  aircraft flight manual (if required) •	 Aircraft equipment list •	 Required weight and balance data •	 Maintenance records •	 Applicable airworthiness directives (ADs)  

For a detailed explanation of the required pilot maneuvers and  performance standards, refer to the PTS pertaining to the type  of certification and aircraft selected. These standards may be  downloaded free of charge from the FAA at www.faa.gov. They  may also be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents  or GPO bookstores. Most airport fixed-base operators and flight  schools carry a variety of government publications and charts,  as well as commercially published materials.  

# Who Administers the FAA Practical Tests?  

Due to the varied responsibilities of the FSDOs, practical tests  are usually given by DPEs. An applicant should schedule the  practical test by appointment to avoid conflicts and wasted  time. A list of examiner names can be obtained from the local  FSDO. Since a DPE serves without pay from the government  for conducting practical tests and processing the necessary  reports, the examiner is allowed to charge a reasonable fee.  There is no charge for the practical test when conducted by  an FAA inspector.  

# Role of the Certificated Flight Instructor  

To become a CFI, a pilot must meet the provisions of 14 CFR  part 61. The FAA places full responsibility for student flight  training on the shoulders of the CFI, who is the cornerstone  of aviation safety. It is the job of the flight instructor to train  the student pilot in all the knowledge areas and teach the  skills necessary for the student pilot to operate safely and  competently as a certificated pilot in the NAS. The training  includes airmanship skills, pilot judgment and decision- making, and good operating practices.  

A pilot training program depends on the quality of the  ground and flight instruction the student pilot receives. The  flight instructor must possess a thorough understanding of  the learning process, knowledge of the fundamentals of  teaching, and the ability to communicate effectively with the  student pilot. Use of a structured training program and formal  course syllabus is crucial for effective and comprehensive  flight training. It should be clear to the student in advance of  every lesson what the course of training will involve and the  criteria for successful completion. This should include the  flight instructor briefing and debriefing the student before and  after every lesson. Additionally, scenario-based training has  become the preferred method of flight instruction today. This  involves presenting the student with realistic flight scenarios  and recommended actions for mitigating risk.  

Insistence on correct techniques and procedures from the  beginning of training by the flight instructor ensures that the  student pilot develops proper flying habits. Any deficiencies  in the maneuvers or techniques must immediately be  emphasized and corrected. A flight instructor serves as a role  model for the student pilot who observes the flying habits of  his or her flight instructor during flight instruction, as well  as when the instructor conducts other pilot operations. Thus,  the flight instructor becomes a model of flying proficiency  for the student who, consciously or unconsciously, attempts  to imitate the instructor. For this reason, a flight instructor  should observe recognized safety practices, as well as  regulations during all flight operations.  

The student pilot who enrolls in a pilot training program  commits considerable time, effort, and expense to achieve a  pilot certificate. Students often judge the effectiveness of the  flight instructor and the success of the pilot training program  based on their ability to pass the requisite FAA practical  test. A competent flight instructor stresses to the student that  practical tests are a sampling of pilot ability compressed into  a short period of time. The goal of a flight instructor is to  train the “total” pilot.  

# Role of the Designated Pilot Examiner  

The Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE) plays an important  role in the FAA’s mission of promoting aviation safety  by administering FAA practical tests for pilot and Flight  Instructor Certificates and associated ratings. Although  administering these tests is a responsibility of the ASI, the  FAA’s highest priority is making air travel safer by inspecting  aircraft that fly in the United States. To satisfy the need for  pilot testing and certification services, the FAA delegates  certain responsibilities to private individuals who are not  FAA employees.  

Appointed in accordance with 14 CFR part 183, section  183.23, a DPE is an individual who meets the qualification  requirements of the Pilot Examiner’s Handbook, FAA Order  8710.3, and who:  

•	 Is technically qualified •	 Holds all pertinent category, class, and type ratings  for each aircraft related to their designation •	 Meets requirements of 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.56,  61.57, and 61.58, as appropriate •	 Is current and qualified to act as PIC of each aircraft  for which he or she is authorized •	 Maintains at least a Third-Class Medical Certificate,  if required •	 Maintains a current Flight Instructor Certificate, if  required  

serve the public, and must adhere to FAA policies and  procedures in certification matters. The FAA expects the  DPE to administer practical tests with the same degree of  professionalism, using the same methods, procedures, and  standards as an FAA ASI.  

# Chapter Summary  

The FAA has entered the second century of civil aviation as a  robust government organization and is taking full advantage of  technology, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite  technology to enhance the safety of civil aviation. The Internet  has also become an important tool in promoting aviation safety  and providing around-the-clock resources for the aviation  community. Handbooks, regulations, standards, references,  and online courses are now available at www.faa.gov.  

In keeping with the FAA’s belief that safety is a learned  behavior, the FAA offers many courses and seminars to  enhance air safety. The FAA puts the burden of instilling safe  flying habits on the flight instructor, who should follow basic  flight safety practices and procedures in every flight operation  he or she undertakes with a student pilot. Operational safety  practices include, but are not limited to, collision avoidance  procedures consisting of proper scanning techniques, use of  checklists, runway incursion avoidance, positive transfer of  controls, and workload management. These safety practices  are discussed more fully within this handbook. Safe flight also  depends on Scenario-Based Training (SBT) that teaches the  student pilot how to respond in different flight situations. The  FAA has incorporated these techniques along with decision- making methods, such as aeronautical decision-making 

 (ADM), risk management, and crew resource management 

 (CRM), which are covered more completely in Chapter 2,  Aeronautical Decision-Making.  

Designated to perform specific pilot certification tasks  on behalf of the FAA, a DPE may charge a reasonable  fee. Generally, a DPE’s authority is limited to accepting  applications and conducting practical tests leading to the  issuance of specific pilot certificates and/or ratings. The  majority of FAA practical tests at the private and commercial  pilot levels are administered by DPEs.  

DPE candidates must have good industry reputations for  professionalism, integrity, a demonstrated willingness to  

# Chapter 2 Aeronautical  Decision-Making  

# Introduction  

Aeronautical decision-making (ADM) is decision-making  in a unique environment—aviation. It is a systematic  approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently  determine the best course of action in response to a given set  of circumstances. It is what a pilot intends to do based on the  latest information he or she has.  

![](images/1bf8a2bc614075bce7f965b3b595009548b69ac6130a74237398c62f7c74616e.jpg)  

The importance of learning and understanding effective  ADM skills cannot be overemphasized. While progress is  continually being made in the advancement of pilot training  methods, aircraft equipment and systems, and services  for pilots, accidents still occur. Despite all the changes in  technology to improve flight safety, one factor remains the  same: the human factor which leads to errors. It is estimated  that approximately 80 percent of all aviation accidents are  related to human factors and the vast majority of these  accidents occur during landing (24.1 percent) and takeoff  (23.4 percent).  [Figure 2-1]  

ADM is a systematic approach to risk assessment and stress  management. To understand ADM is to also understand  how personal attitudes can influence decision-making and  how those attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the  flight deck. It is important to understand the factors that cause  humans to make decisions and how the decision-making  process not only works, but can be improved.  

This chapter focuses on helping the pilot improve his or  her ADM skills with the goal of mitigating the risk factors  associated with flight. Advisory Circular (AC) 60-22,  “Aeronautical Decision-Making,” provides background  references, definitions, and other pertinent information about  ADM training in the general aviation (GA) environment.  [Figure 2-2]  

# History of ADM  

For over 25 years, the importance of good pilot judgment, or  aeronautical decision-making (ADM), has been recognized  as critical to the safe operation of aircraft, as well as accident  avoidance. The airline industry, motivated by the need to  reduce accidents caused by human factors, developed the first  training programs based on improving ADM. Crew resource  management (CRM) training for flight crews is focused on  the effective use of all available resources: human resources,  hardware, and information supporting ADM to facilitate crew  cooperation and improve decision-making. The goal of all  flight crews is good ADM and the use of CRM is one way  to make good decisions.  

Research in this area prompted the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) to produce training directed at  improving the decision-making of pilots and led to current  FAA regulations that require that decision-making be taught  as part of the pilot training curriculum. ADM research,  development, and testing culminated in 1987 with the  publication of six manuals oriented to the decision-making  needs of variously rated pilots. These manuals provided  multifaceted materials designed to reduce the number  of decision-related accidents. The effectiveness of these  materials was validated in independent studies where student  pilots received such training in conjunction with the standard  flying curriculum. When tested, the pilots who had received  ADM-training made fewer in-flight errors than those who had

not received ADM training. The differences were statistically  significant and ranged from about 10 to 50 percent fewer  judgment errors. In the operational environment, an operator  flying about 400,000 hours annually demonstrated a 54  percent reduction in accident rate after using these materials  for recurrency training.  

Contrary to popular opinion, good judgment can be taught.  Tradition held that good judgment was a natural by-product  of experience, but as pilots continued to log accident-free  flight hours, a corresponding increase of good judgment  was assumed. Building upon the foundation of conventional  decision-making, ADM enhances the process to decrease the  probability of human error and increase the probability of a  safe flight. ADM provides a structured, systematic approach  to analyzing changes that occur during a flight and how these  changes might affect the safe outcome of a flight. The ADM  process addresses all aspects of decision-making in the flight  deck and identifies the steps involved in good decision-making.  

Steps for good decision-making are:  

1.	 Identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe flight 2.	 Learning behavior modification techniques 3.	 Learning how to recognize and cope with stress 4.	 Developing risk assessment skills  

5.	 Using all resources 6.	 Evaluating the effectiveness of one’s ADM skills  

# Risk Management  

The goal of risk management is to proactively identify  safety-related hazards and mitigate the associated risks. Risk  management is an important component of ADM. When a  pilot follows good decision-making practices, the inherent risk  in a flight is reduced or even eliminated. The ability to make  good decisions is based upon direct or indirect experience  and education. The formal risk management decision-making  process involves six steps as shown in  Figure 2-3.  

Consider automotive seat belt use. In just two decades, seat  belt use has become the norm, placing those who do not  wear seat belts outside the norm, but this group may learn to  wear a seat belt by either direct or indirect experience. For  example, a driver learns through direct experience about the  value of wearing a seat belt when he or she is involved in a car  accident that leads to a personal injury. An indirect learning  experience occurs when a loved one is injured during a car  accident because he or she failed to wear a seat belt.  

As you work through the ADM cycle, it is important to  remember the four fundamental principles of risk management.  

![](images/e474509798f033113020a028a9b35783e4d4db946a9afcbe64aa0de9c2fe9c03.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.   Risk management decision-making process.  

1. 	 Accept no unnecessary risk. Flying is not possible  without risk, but unnecessary risk comes without a  corresponding return. If you are flying a new airplane  for the first time, you might determine that the risk  of making that flight in low visibility conditions is  unnecessary.  

2. 	 Make risk decisions at the appropriate level. Risk  decisions should be made by the person who can  develop and implement risk controls. Remember  that you are pilot-in-command, so never let anyone  else—not ATC and not your passengers—make risk  decisions for you.  

3. 	 Accept risk when benefits outweigh dangers (costs).  In any flying activity, it is necessary to accept some  degree of risk. A day with good weather, for example,  is a much better time to fly an unfamiliar airplane for  the first time than a day with low IFR conditions.  

4. 	 Integrate risk management into planning at all levels.  Because risk is an unavoidable part of every flight,  safety requires the use of appropriate and effective risk  management not just in the preflight planning stage,  but in all stages of the flight.  

While poor decision-making in everyday life does not always  lead to tragedy, the margin for error in aviation is thin. Since  ADM enhances management of an aeronautical environment,  all pilots should become familiar with and employ ADM.  

# Crew Resource Management (CRM) and  Single-Pilot Resource Management  

While CRM focuses on pilots operating in crew environments,  many of the concepts apply to single-pilot operations. Many  CRM principles have been successfully applied to single-pilot  aircraft and led to the development of Single-Pilot Resource  Management (SRM). SRM is defined as the art and science  of managing all the resources (both on-board the aircraft  and from outside sources) available to a single pilot (prior  to and during flight) to ensure the successful outcome of the  flight. SRM includes the concepts of ADM, risk management 

 (RM), task management (TM), automation management 

 (AM), controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) awareness, and  situational awareness (SA). SRM training helps the pilot  maintain situational awareness by managing the automation  and associated aircraft control and navigation tasks. This  enables the pilot to accurately assess and manage risk and  make accurate and timely decisions.  

SRM is all about helping pilots learn how to gather  information, analyze it, and make decisions. Although the  flight is coordinated by a single person and not an onboard  flight crew, the use of available resources such as auto-pilot  and air traffic control (ATC) replicates the principles of CRM.  

# Hazard and Risk  

Two defining elements of ADM are hazard and risk. Hazard  is a real or perceived condition, event, or circumstance that a  pilot encounters. When faced with a hazard, the pilot makes  an assessment of that hazard based upon various factors. The  pilot assigns a value to the potential impact of the hazard,  which qualifies the pilot’s assessment of the hazard—risk.  

Therefore, risk is an assessment of the single or cumulative  hazard facing a pilot; however, different pilots see hazards  differently. For example, the pilot arrives to preflight and  discovers a small, blunt type nick in the leading edge at the  middle of the aircraft’s prop. Since the aircraft is parked on  the tarmac, the nick was probably caused by another aircraft’s  prop wash blowing some type of debris into the propeller.  The nick is the hazard (a present condition). The risk is prop  fracture if the engine is operated with damage to a prop blade.  

The seasoned pilot may see the nick as a low risk. He  realizes this type of nick diffuses stress over a large area, is  located in the strongest portion of the propeller, and based  on experience; he does not expect it to propagate a crack that  can lead to high risk problems. He does not cancel his flight.  

The inexperienced pilot may see the nick as a high risk factor  because he is unsure of the affect the nick will have on the  operation of the prop, and he has been told that damage to  a prop could cause a catastrophic failure. This assessment  leads him to cancel his flight.  

Therefore, elements or factors affecting individuals are  different and profoundly impact decision-making. These  are called human factors and can transcend education,  experience, health, physiological aspects, etc.  

Another example of risk assessment was the flight of a  Beechcraft King Air equipped with deicing and anti-icing.  The pilot deliberately flew into moderate to severe icing  conditions while ducking under cloud cover. A prudent pilot  would assess the risk as high and beyond the capabilities of  the aircraft, yet this pilot did the opposite. Why did the pilot  take this action?  

Past experience prompted the action. The pilot had  successfully flown into these conditions repeatedly although  the icing conditions were previously forecast 2,000 feet above  the surface. This time, the conditions were forecast from the  surface. Since the pilot was in a hurry and failed to factor  in the difference between the forecast altitudes, he assigned  a low risk to the hazard and took a chance. He and the  passengers died from a poor risk assessment of the situation.  

# Hazardous Attitudes and Antidotes  

Being fit to fly depends on more than just a pilot’s physical  condition and recent experience. For example, attitude  affects the quality of decisions. Attitude is a motivational  predisposition to respond to people, situations, or events in a  given manner. Studies have identified five hazardous attitudes  that can interfere with the ability to make sound decisions  and exercise authority properly: anti-authority, impulsivity,  invulnerability, macho, and resignation.  [Figure 2-4]  

Hazardous attitudes contribute to poor pilot judgment but  can be effectively counteracted by redirecting the hazardous  attitude so that correct action can be taken. Recognition of  hazardous thoughts is the first step toward neutralizing them.  After recognizing a thought as hazardous, the pilot should  label it as hazardous, then state the corresponding antidote.  Antidotes should be memorized for each of the hazardous  attitudes so they automatically come to mind when needed.  

![Figure 2-4.   The five hazardous attitudes identified through past and contemporary study. ](images/2d1540d0896a583fcf7f3767012a57b79ac22136f3261ff040d6c9b34a0c208b.jpg)  

During each flight, the single pilot makes many decisions  under hazardous conditions. To fly safely, the pilot needs  to assess the degree of risk and determine the best course of  action to mitigate the risk.  

# Assessing Risk  

For the single pilot, assessing risk is not as simple as it sounds.  For example, the pilot acts as his or her own quality control  in making decisions. If a fatigued pilot who has flown 16  hours is asked if he or she is too tired to continue flying, the  answer may be “no.” Most pilots are goal oriented and when  asked to accept a flight, there is a tendency to deny personal  limitations while adding weight to issues not germane to the  mission. For example, pilots of helicopter emergency services  (EMS) have been known (more than other groups) to make  flight decisions that add significant weight to the patient’s  welfare. These pilots add weight to intangible factors (the  patient in this case) and fail to appropriately quantify actual  hazards, such as fatigue or weather, when making flight  decisions. The single pilot who has no other crew member  for consultation must wrestle with the intangible factors that  draw one into a hazardous position. Therefore, he or she has  a greater vulnerability than a full crew.  

Examining National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  reports and other accident research can help a pilot learn to  assess risk more effectively. For example, the accident rate  during night visual flight rules (VFR) decreases by nearly  50 percent once a pilot obtains 100 hours and continues to  decrease until the 1,000 hour level. The data suggest that for  the first 500 hours, pilots flying VFR at night might want to  establish higher personal limitations than are required by the  regulations and, if applicable, apply instrument flying skills  in this environment.  

Several risk assessment models are available to assist in the  process of assessing risk. The models, all taking slightly  different approaches, seek a common goal of assessing risk  in an objective manner. The most basic tool is the risk matrix.  [Figure 2-5]  It assesses two items: the likelihood of an event  occurring and the consequence of that event.  

# Likelihood of an Event  

Likelihood is nothing more than taking a situation and  determining the probability of its occurrence. It is rated as  probable, occasional, remote, or improbable. For example, a  pilot is flying from point A to point B (50 miles) in marginal  visual flight rules (MVFR) conditions. The likelihood of  encountering potential instrument meteorological conditions  (IMC) is the first question the pilot needs to answer. The  experiences of other pilots, coupled with the forecast, might  

![](images/47780018bdce33383b4d010f9c82249540e208c50e4b2ce3202e8d246329b053.jpg)  
Figure 2-5.   This risk matrix can be used for almost any operation  by assigning likelihood and consequence. In the case presented,  the pilot assigned a likelihood of occasional and the severity as  catastrophic. As one can see, this falls in the high risk area.  

cause the pilot to assign “occasional” to determine the  probability of encountering IMC.  

The following are guidelines for making assignments.  

•	 Probable—an event will occur several times •	 Occasional—an event will probably occur sometime • 	 Remote—an event is unlikely to occur, but is possible •	 Improbable—an event is highly unlikely to occur  

# Severity of an Event  

The next element is the severity or consequence of a pilot’s  action(s). It can relate to injury and/or damage. If the  individual in the example above is not an instrument rated  pilot, what are the consequences of him or her encountering  inadvertent IMC conditions? In this case, because the pilot  is not IFR rated, the consequences are catastrophic. The  following are guidelines for this assignment.  

• 	 Catastrophic—results in fatalities, total loss • 	 Critical—severe injury, major damage • 	 Marginal—minor injury, minor damage • 	 Negligible—less than minor injury, less than minor  system damage  

Simply connecting the two factors as shown in  Figure 2-5 indicates the risk is high and the pilot must either not fly or  fly only after finding ways to mitigate, eliminate, or control  the risk.  

Although the matrix in  Figure 2-5  provides a general viewpoint  of a generic situation, a more comprehensive program can be  made that is tailored to a pilot’s flying.  [Figure 2-6]  This  program includes a wide array of aviation-related activities  specific to the pilot and assesses health, fatigue, weather,  

![](images/6e4845457844082d47efa5dbbcc3a6a6c0cbc272b5fc18680374be054066a372.jpg)

capabilities, etc. The scores are added and the overall score  falls into various ranges, with the range representative of  actions that a pilot imposes upon himself or herself.  

# Mitigating Risk  

Risk assessment is only part of the equation. After  determining the level of risk, the pilot needs to mitigate the  risk. For example, the pilot flying from point A to point B (50  miles) in MVFR conditions has several ways to reduce risk:  

• 	 Wait for the weather to improve to good visual flight  rules (VFR) conditions. • 	 Take an instrument-rated pilot.  • 	 Delay the flight.  • 	 Cancel the flight. • 	 Drive.  

One of the best ways single pilots can mitigate risk is to use  the IMSAFE checklist to determine physical and mental  readiness for flying:  

1. 	 Illness—Am I sick? Illness is an obvious pilot risk. 2. 	 Medication—Am I taking any medicines that might  affect my judgment or make me drowsy? 3. 	 Stress—Am I under psychological pressure from the  job? Do I have money, health, or family problems?  Stress causes concentration and performance problems.  While the regulations list medical conditions that  require grounding, stress is not among them. The pilot  should consider the effects of stress on performance.  4.	 Alcohol—Have I been drinking within 8 hours?  Within 24 hours? As little as one ounce of liquor, one  bottle of beer, or four ounces of wine can impair flying  skills. Alcohol also renders a pilot more susceptible  to disorientation and hypoxia.  5. 	 Fatigue—Am I tired and not adequately rested?  Fatigue continues to be one of the most insidious  hazards to flight safety, as it may not be apparent to  a pilot until serious errors are made.  6. 	 Emotion—Am I emotionally upset?  

# The PAVE Checklist  

Another way to mitigate risk is to perceive hazards. By  incorporating the PAVE checklist into preflight planning,  the pilot divides the risks of flight into four categories:  P ilot- in-command (PIC),  A ircraft, en V ironment, and  E xternal  pressures (PAVE) which form part of a pilot’s decision- making process.  

With the PAVE checklist, pilots have a simple way to  remember each category to examine for risk prior to each flight.  

Once a pilot identifies the risks of a flight, he or she needs  to decide whether the risk, or combination of risks, can be  managed safely and successfully. If not, make the decision to  cancel the flight. If the pilot decides to continue with the flight,  he or she should develop strategies to mitigate the risks. One  way a pilot can control the risks is to set personal minimums  for items in each risk category. These are limits unique to that  individual pilot’s current level of experience and proficiency.  

For example, the aircraft may have a maximum crosswind  component of 15 knots listed in the aircraft flight manual  (AFM), and the pilot has experience with 10 knots of direct  crosswind. It could be unsafe to exceed a 10 knot crosswind  component without additional training. Therefore, the 10 knot  crosswind experience level is that pilot’s personal limitation  until additional training with a certificated flight instructor  (CFI) provides the pilot with additional experience for flying  in crosswinds that exceed 10 knots.  

One of the most important concepts that safe pilots  understand is the difference between what is “legal” in terms  of the regulations, and what is “smart” or “safe” in terms of  pilot experience and proficiency.  

#  $P=$   Pilot in Command (PIC)  

The pilot is one of the risk factors in a flight. The pilot must  ask, “Am I ready for this trip?” in terms of experience,  recency, currency, physical, and emotional condition. The  IMSAFE checklist provides the answers.  

#  $A=$   Aircraft  

What limitations will the aircraft impose upon the trip? Ask  the following questions:  

• 	 Is this the right aircraft for the flight? •	 Am I familiar with and current in this aircraft? Aircraft  performance figures and the AFM are based on a brand  new aircraft flown by a professional test pilot. Keep  that in mind while assessing personal and aircraft  performance. • 	 Is this aircraft equipped for the flight? Instruments?  Lights? Navigation and communication equipment  adequate? • 	 Can this aircraft use the runways available for the trip  with an adequate margin of safety under the conditions  to be flown? • 	 Can this aircraft carry the planned load? • 	 Can this aircraft operate at the altitudes needed for the  trip? •	 Does this aircraft have sufficient fuel capacity, with  reserves, for trip legs planned?  

•	 Does the fuel quantity delivered match the fuel  quantity ordered?  

# V = EnVironment  

# Weather  

Weather is a major environmental consideration. Earlier it was  suggested pilots set their own personal minimums, especially  when it comes to weather. As pilots evaluate the weather for  a particular flight, they should consider the following:  

• 	 What is the current ceiling and visibility? In  mountainous terrain, consider having higher  minimums for ceiling and visibility, particularly if  the terrain is unfamiliar. • 	 Consider the possibility that the weather may be  different than forecast. Have alternative plans and  be ready and willing to divert, should an unexpected  change occur. • 	 Consider the winds at the airports being used and the  strength of the crosswind component. • 	 If flying in mountainous terrain, consider whether  there are strong winds aloft. Strong winds in  mountainous terrain can cause severe turbulence and  downdrafts and be very hazardous for aircraft even  when there is no other significant weather. • 	 Are there any thunderstorms present or forecast? • 	 If there are clouds, is there any icing, current or  forecast? What is the temperature/dew point spread  and the current temperature at altitude? Can descent  be made safely all along the route?  • 	 If icing conditions are encountered, is the pilot  experienced at operating the aircraft’s deicing or  anti-icing equipment? Is this equipment in good  condition and functional? For what icing conditions  is the aircraft rated, if any?  

# Terrain  

Evaluation of terrain is another important component of  analyzing the flight environment.  

•	 To avoid terrain and obstacles, especially at night or  in low visibility, determine safe altitudes in advance  by using the altitudes shown on VFR and IFR charts  during preflight planning. •	 Use maximum elevation figures (MEFs) and other  easily obtainable data to minimize chances of an  inflight collision with terrain or obstacles.  

# Airport  

•	 What lights are available at the destination and  alternate airports? VASI/PAPI or ILS glideslope  

guidance? Is the terminal airport equipped with them?  Are they working? Will the pilot need to use the radio  to activate the airport lights? •	 Check the Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) for closed  runways or airports. Look for runway or beacon lights  out, nearby towers, etc. •	 Choose the flight route wisely. An engine failure gives  the nearby airports supreme importance.  •	 Are there shorter or obstructed fields at the destination  and/or alternate airports?  

# Airspace  

•	 If the trip is over remote areas, is there appropriate  clothing, water, and survival gear onboard in the event  of a forced landing? • 	 If the trip includes flying over water or unpopulated  areas with the chance of losing visual reference to the  horizon, the pilot must be prepared to fly IFR. •	 Check the airspace and any temporary flight restriction  (TFRs) along the route of flight.  

# Nighttime  

Night flying requires special consideration.  

• 	 If the trip includes flying at night over water or  unpopulated areas with the chance of losing visual  reference to the horizon, the pilot must be prepared  to fly IFR. • 	 Will the flight conditions allow a safe emergency  landing at night? •	 Perform preflight check of all aircraft lights, interior  and exterior, for a night flight. Carry at least two  flashlights—one for exterior preflight and a smaller  one that can be dimmed and kept nearby.  

# E = External Pressures  

External pressures are influences external to the flight that  create a sense of pressure to complete a flight—often at the  expense of safety. Factors that can be external pressures  include the following:  

• 	 Someone waiting at the airport for the flight’s arrival • 	 A passenger the pilot does not want to disappoint • 	 The desire to demonstrate pilot qualifications • 	 The desire to impress someone (Probably the two most  dangerous words in aviation are “Watch this!”) • 	 The desire to satisfy a specific personal goal (“get- home-itis,” “get-there-itis,” and “let’s-go-itis”) •	 The pilot’s general goal-completion orientation  

•	 Emotional pressure associated with acknowledging  that skill and experience levels may be lower than a  pilot would like them to be. Pride can be a powerful  external factor!  

Managing External Pressures  

Management of external pressure is the single most important  key to risk management because it is the one risk factor  category that can cause a pilot to ignore all the other risk  factors. External pressures put time-related pressure on the  pilot and figure into a majority of accidents.  

The use of personal standard operating procedures (SOPs) is  one way to manage external pressures. The goal is to supply a  release for the external pressures of a flight. These procedures  include but are not limited to:  

•	 Allow time on a trip for an extra fuel stop or to make  an unexpected landing because of weather. •	 Have alternate plans for a late arrival or make backup  airline reservations for must-be-there trips. • 	 For really important trips, plan to leave early enough  so that there would still be time to drive to the  destination, if necessary.  

# Pilot  

A pilot must continually make decisions about competency,  condition of health, mental and emotional state, level of fatigue,  and many other variables. For example, a pilot may be called  early in the morning to make a long flight. If a pilot has had only  a few hours of sleep and is concerned that the congestion  being experienced could be the onset of a cold, it would be  prudent to consider if the flight could be accomplished safely.  

A pilot had only 4 hours of sleep the night before being asked  by the boss to fly to a meeting in a city 750 miles away. The  reported weather was marginal and not expected to improve.  After assessing fitness as a pilot, it was decided that it would  not be wise to make the flight. The boss was initially unhappy,  but later convinced by the pilot that the risks involved were  unacceptable.  

# Environment  

This encompasses many elements not pilot or airplane related.  It can include such factors as weather, air traffic control,  navigational aids (NAVAIDS), terrain, takeoff and landing  areas, and surrounding obstacles. Weather is one element that  can change drastically over time and distance.  

A pilot was landing a small airplane just after a heavy jet had  departed a parallel runway. The pilot assumed that wake  turbulence would not be a problem since landings had been  performed under similar circumstances. Due to a combination  of prevailing winds and wake turbulence from the heavy jet  drifting across the landing runway, the airplane made a hard  landing. The pilot made an error when assessing the flight  environment.  

•	 Advise those who are waiting at the destination that  the arrival may be delayed. Know how to notify them  when delays are encountered.  •	 Manage passengers’ expectations. Make sure  passengers know that they might not arrive on a firm  schedule, and if they must arrive by a certain time,  they should make alternative plans. • 	 Eliminate pressure to return home, even on a casual  day flight, by carrying a small overnight kit containing  prescriptions, contact lens solutions, toiletries, or other  necessities on every flight.  

The key to managing external pressure is to be ready for  and accept delays. Remember that people get delayed when  traveling on airlines, driving a car, or taking a bus. The pilot’s  goal is to manage risk, not create hazards.  [Figure 2-7]  

# Human Factors  

Why are human conditions, such as fatigue, complacency  and stress, so important in aviation? These conditions, along  with many others, are called human factors. Human factors  directly cause or contribute to many aviation accidents and  

# Aircraft  

A pilot will frequently base decisions on the evaluations of the  aircraft, such as performance, equipment, or airworthiness.  

During a preflight, a pilot noticed a small amount of oil dripping  from the bottom of the cowling. Although the quantity of oil  seemed insignificant at the time, the pilot decided to delay the  takeoff and have a mechanic check the source of the oil.  The pilot’s good judgment was confirmed when the mechanic  found that one of the oil cooler hose fittings was loose.  

# External pressures  

The interaction between the pilot, airplane, and the environment   is greatly influenced by the purpose of each flight operation.   The pilot must evaluate the three previous areas to decide on   the desirability of undertaking or continuing the flight as planned.   It is worth asking why the flight is being made, how critical is it to   maintain the schedule, and is the trip worth the risks?  

On a ferry flight to deliver an airplane from the factory, in   marginal weather conditions, the pilot calculated the   groundspeed and determined that the airplane would arrive at   the destination with only 10 minutes of fuel remaining. The pilot   was determined to keep on schedule by trying to “stretch” the   fuel supply instead of landing to refuel. After landing with low   fuel state, the pilot realized that this could have easily resulted   in an emergency landing in deteriorating weather conditions.   This was a chance that was not worth taking to keep the   planned schedule.  

have been documented as a primary contributor to more than  70 percent of aircraft accidents.  

Typically, human factor incidents/accidents are associated  with flight operations but recently have also become a major  concern in aviation maintenance and air traffic management  as well.  [Figure 2-8]  Over the past several years, the FAA has  made the study and research of human factors a top priority  by working closely with engineers, pilots, mechanics, and  ATC to apply the latest knowledge about human factors in  an effort to help operators and maintainers improve safety  and efficiency in their daily operations.  

Human factors science, or human factors technologies,  is a multidisciplinary field incorporating contributions  from psychology, engineering, industrial design, statistics,  operations research, and anthropometry. It is a term that  covers the science of understanding the properties of  human capability, the application of this understanding to  the design, development and deployment of systems and  services, and the art of ensuring successful application of  human factor principles into all aspects of aviation to include  pilots, ATC, and aviation maintenance. Human factors is  often considered synonymous with CRM or maintenance  resource management (MRM) but is really much broader in  both its knowledge base and scope. Human factors involves  gathering research specific to certain situations (i.e., flight,  maintenance, stress levels, knowledge) about human abilities,  limitations, and other characteristics and applying it to tool  design, machines, systems, tasks, jobs, and environments  to produce safe, comfortable, and effective human use. The  entire aviation community benefits greatly from human  factors research and development as it helps better understand  how humans can most safely and efficiently perform their  jobs and improve the tools and systems in which they interact.  

# Human Behavior  

Studies of human behavior have tried to determine an  individual’s predisposition to taking risks and the level of  an individual’s involvement in accidents. In 1951, a study  regarding injury-prone children was published by Elizabeth  Mechem Fuller and Helen B. Baune, of the University of  Minnesota. The study was comprised of two separate groups  of second grade students. Fifty-five students were considered  accident repeaters and 48 students had no accidents. Both  groups were from the same school of 600 and their family  demographics were similar.  

The accident-free group showed a superior knowledge  of safety, was considered industrious and cooperative  

![](images/082c9228ce33bf8390535ae6b88a62c9dccd61a9d2bc2d378d65628a0cf6c50e.jpg)

with others, but were not considered physically inclined.  The accident-repeater group had better gymnastic skills,  was considered aggressive and impulsive, demonstrated  rebellious behavior when under stress, were poor losers, and  liked to be the center of attention. One interpretation of this  data—an adult predisposition to injury stems from childhood  behavior and environment—leads to the conclusion that  any pilot group should be comprised only of pilots who are  safety-conscious, industrious, and cooperative.  

Clearly, this is not only an inaccurate inference, it is  impossible. Pilots are drawn from the general population and  exhibit all types of personality traits. Thus, it is important that  good decision-making skills be taught to all pilots.  

Historically, the term “pilot error” has been used to describe  an accident in which an action or decision made by the  pilot was the cause or a contributing factor that led to the  accident. This definition also includes the pilot’s failure  to make a correct decision or take proper action. From a  broader perspective, the phrase “human factors related” more  aptly describes these accidents. A single decision or event  does not lead to an accident, but a series of events and the  resultant decisions together form a chain of events leading  to an outcome.  

In his article “Accident-Prone Pilots,” Dr. Patrick R. Veillette  uses the history of “Captain Everyman” to demonstrate how  aircraft accidents are caused more by a chain of poor choices  rather than one single poor choice. In the case of Captain  Everyman, after a gear-up landing accident, he became  involved in another accident while taxiing a Beech 58P Baron  out of the ramp. Interrupted by a radio call from the dispatcher,  Everyman neglected to complete the fuel cross-feed check  before taking off. Everyman, who was flying solo, left the  right-fuel selector in the cross-feed position. Once aloft and  cruising, he noticed a right roll tendency and corrected with  aileron trim. He did not realize that both engines were feeding  off the left wing’s tank, making the wing lighter.  

After two hours of flight, the right engine quit when  Everyman was flying along a deep canyon gorge. While he  was trying to troubleshoot the cause of the right engine’s  failure, the left engine quit. Everyman landed the aircraft on  a river sand bar but it sank into ten feet of water.  

Several years later Everyman flew a de Havilland Twin  Otter to deliver supplies to a remote location. When he  returned to home base and landed, the aircraft veered sharply  to the left, departed the runway, and ran into a marsh 375  feet from the runway. The airframe and engines sustained  considerable damage. Upon inspecting the wreck, accident  investigators found the nose wheel steering tiller in the fully  deflected position. Both the after takeoff and before landing  checklists require the tiller to be placed in the neutral position.  Everyman had overlooked this item.  

Now, is Everyman accident prone or just unlucky? Skipping  details on a checklist appears to be a common theme in the  preceding accidents. While most pilots have made similar  mistakes, these errors were probably caught prior to a mishap  due to extra margin, good warning systems, a sharp copilot,  or just good luck. What makes a pilot less prone to accidents?  

The successful pilot possesses the ability to concentrate,  manage workloads, and monitor and perform several  simultaneous tasks. Some of the latest psychological  screenings used in aviation test applicants for their ability  to multitask, measuring both accuracy, as well as the  individual’s ability to focus attention on several subjects  simultaneously. The FAA oversaw an extensive research  study on the similarities and dissimilarities of accident-free  pilots and those who were not. The project surveyed over  4,000 pilots, half of whom had “clean” records while the  other half had been involved in an accident.  

Five traits were discovered in pilots prone to having  accidents. These pilots:  

•	 Have disdain toward rules  •	 Have very high correlation between accidents on their  flying records and safety violations on their driving  records •	 Frequently fall into the “thrill and adventure seeking”  personality category •	 Are impulsive rather than methodical and disciplined,  both in their information gathering and in the speed  and selection of actions to be taken •	 Have a disregard for or tend to under  utilize outside  sources of information, including copilots, flight  attendants, flight service personnel, flight instructors,  and ATC  

# The Decision-Making Process  

An understanding of the decision-making process provides  the pilot with a foundation for developing ADM and SRM  skills. While some situations, such as engine failure, require an  immediate pilot response using established procedures, there is  usually time during a flight to analyze any changes that occur,  gather information, and assess risks before reaching a decision.  

Risk management and risk intervention is much more than the  simple definitions of the terms might suggest. Risk management  and risk intervention are decision-making processes designed  to systematically identify hazards, assess the degree of risk, and  determine the best course of action. These processes involve  the identification of hazards, followed by assessments of the  risks, analysis of the controls, making control decisions, using  the controls, and monitoring the results.  

The steps leading to this decision constitute a decision- making process. Three models of a structured framework  for problem-solving and decision-making are the 5P, the 3P  using PAVE, CARE and TEAM, and the DECIDE models.  They provide assistance in organizing the decision process.  All these models have been identified as helpful to the single  pilot in organizing critical decisions.  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM)  

Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM) is about how to  gather information, analyze it, and make decisions. Learning  how to identify problems, analyze the information, and make  informed and timely decisions is not as straightforward as the  training involved in learning specific maneuvers. Learning  how to judge a situation and “how to think” in the endless  variety of situations encountered while flying out in the “real  world” is more difficult.  

There is no one right answer in ADM, rather each pilot is  expected to analyze each situation in light of experience  level, personal minimums, and current physical and mental  readiness level, and make his or her own decision.  

# The 5 Ps Check  

SRM sounds good on paper, but it requires a way for pilots  to understand and use it in their daily flights. One practical  application is called the “Five Ps (5 Ps).”  [Figure 2-9]  The  5 Ps consist of “the Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers,  and the Programming.” Each of these areas consists of a set  of challenges and opportunities that every pilot encounters.  Each challenge and opportunity can substantially increase or  decrease the risk of successfully completing the flight based  on the pilot’s ability to make informed and timely decisions.  The  $5\;\mathrm{Ps}$   are used to evaluate the pilot’s current situation at  key decision points during the flight or when an emergency  

![](images/408abc30355ca931596a0feb8e177b31b0fef57c67e29e3cd01a4d23b99522fe.jpg)  
Figure 2-9.   The Five Ps checklist.  

arises. These decision points include preflight, pretakeoff,  hourly or at the midpoint of the flight, pre-descent, and just  prior to the final approach fix or for VFR operations, just  prior to entering the traffic pattern.  

The   $5~\mathrm{Ps}$   are based on the idea that pilots have essentially  five variables that impact his or her environment and forcing  him or her to make a single critical decision, or several less  critical decisions, that when added together can create a  critical outcome. These variables are the Plan, the Plane, the  Pilot, the Passengers, and the Programming. This concept  stems from the belief that current decision-making models  tended to be reactionary in nature. A change has to occur  and be detected to drive a risk management decision by the  pilot. For instance, many pilots complete risk management  sheets prior to takeoff. These form a catalog of risks  that may be encountered that day. Each of these risks is  assigned a numerical value. If the total of these numerical  values exceeds a predetermined level, the flight is altered or  cancelled. Informal research shows that while these are useful  documents for teaching risk factors, they are almost never  used outside of formal training programs. The 5P concept is  an attempt to take the information contained in those sheets  and in the other available models and use it.  

The 5P concept relies on the pilot to adopt a “scheduled”  review of the critical variables at points in the flight where  decisions are most likely to be effective. For instance, the  easiest point to cancel a flight due to bad weather is before the  pilot and passengers walk out the door and load the aircraft.  So the first decision point is preflight in the flight planning  room, where all the information is readily available to make  a sound decision, and where communication and Fixed  Base Operator (FBO) services are readily available to make  alternate travel plans.  

The second easiest point in the flight to make a critical safety  decision is just prior to takeoff. Few pilots have ever had  to make an “emergency takeoff.” While the point of the 5P  check is to help the pilot fly, the correct application of the 5  P before takeoff is to assist in making a reasoned go/no-go  decision based on all the information available. That decision  will usually be to “go,” with certain restrictions and changes,  but may also be a “no-go.” The key idea is that these two  points in the process of flying are critical go/no-go points on  each and every flight.  

The third place to review the  $5\;\mathrm{Ps}$   is at the midpoint of the  flight. Often, pilots may wait until the Automated Terminal  information Service (ATIS) is in range to check weather, yet,  at this point in the flight, many good options have already  passed behind the aircraft and pilot. Additionally, fatigue  and low-altitude hypoxia serve to rob the pilot of much of  his or her energy by the end of a long and tiring flight day.  This leads to a transition from a decision-making mode to an  acceptance mode on the part of the pilot. If the flight is longer  than 2 hours, the 5 P check should be conducted hourly.  

The last two decision points are just prior to descent into the  terminal area and just prior to the final approach fix, or if  VFR, just prior to entering the traffic pattern as preparations  for landing commence. Most pilots execute approaches with  the expectation that they will land out of the approach every  time. A healthier approach requires the pilot to assume that  changing conditions (the 5 Ps again) will cause the pilot to  divert or execute the missed approach on every approach.  This keeps the pilot alert to all manner of conditions that  may increase risk and threaten the safe conduct of the flight.  Diverting from cruise altitude saves fuel, allows unhurried  use of the autopilot and is less reactive in nature. Diverting  from the final approach fix, while more difficult, still allows  the pilot to plan and coordinate better, rather than executing  a futile missed approach. Let’s look at a detailed discussion  of each of the Five Ps.  

# The Plan  

The “Plan” can also be called the mission or the task. It  contains the basic elements of cross-country planning,  weather, route, fuel, publications currency, etc. The “Plan”  should be reviewed and updated several times during the  course of the flight. A delayed takeoff due to maintenance,  fast moving weather, and a short notice TFR may all radically  alter the plan. The “plan” is not only about the flight plan,  but also all the events that surround the flight and allow the  pilot to accomplish the mission. The plan is always being  updated and modified and is especially responsive to changes  in the other four remaining Ps. If for no other reason, the  $5\,\mathrm{P}$  check reminds the pilot that the day’s flight plan is real life  and subject to change at any time.  

Obviously, weather is a huge part of any plan. The addition  of datalink weather information gives the advanced avionics  pilot a real advantage in inclement weather, but only if the  pilot is trained to retrieve and evaluate the weather in real  time without sacrificing situational awareness. And of course,  weather information should drive a decision, even if that  decision is to continue on the current plan. Pilots of aircraft  without datalink weather should get updated weather in flight  through an FSS and/or Flight Watch.  

# The Plane  

Both the “plan” and the “plane” are fairly familiar to most  pilots. The “plane” consists of the usual array of mechanical  and cosmetic issues that every aircraft pilot, owner, or  operator can identify. With the advent of advanced avionics,  the “plane” has expanded to include database currency,  automation status, and emergency backup systems that were  unknown a few years ago. Much has been written about  single pilot IFR flight, both with and without an autopilot.  While this is a personal decision, it is just that—a decision.  Low IFR in a non-autopilot equipped aircraft may depend  on several of the other Ps to be discussed. Pilot proficiency,  currency, and fatigue are among them.  

# The Pilot  

Flying, especially when business transportation is involved,  can expose a pilot to risks such as high altitudes, long trips  requiring significant endurance, and challenging weather.  Advanced avionics, when installed, can expose a pilot to high  stresses because of the inherent additional capabilities which  are available. When dealing with pilot risk, it is always best  to consult the “IMSAFE” checklist (see page 2-6).  

The combination of late nights, pilot fatigue, and the effects  of sustained flight above 5,000 feet may cause pilots to  become less discerning, less critical of information, less  decisive, and more compliant and accepting. Just as the most  critical portion of the flight approaches (for instance a night  instrument approach, in the weather, after a 4-hour flight),  the pilot’s guard is down the most. The  $5\;\mathrm{P}$   process helps a  pilot recognize the physiological challenges that they may  face towards the end of the flight prior to takeoff and allows  them to update personal conditions as the flight progresses.  Once risks are identified, the pilot is in a better place to  make alternate plans that lessen the effect of these factors  and provide a safer solution.  

# The Passengers  

One of the key differences between CRM and SRM is the  way passengers interact with the pilot. The pilot of a highly  capable single-engine aircraft maintains a much more personal  relationship with the passengers as he/she is positioned within  an arm’s reach of them throughout the flight.  

The necessity of the passengers to make airline connections  or important business meetings in a timely manner enters  into this pilot’s decision-making loop. Consider a flight  to Dulles Airport in which and the passengers, both close  friends and business partners, need to get to Washington,  D.C. for an important meeting. The weather is VFR all the  way to southern Virginia, then turns to low IFR as the pilot  approaches Dulles. A pilot employing the   $^{5\mathrm{~P~}}$   approach  might consider reserving a rental car at an airport in northern  North Carolina or southern Virginia to coincide with a  refueling stop. Thus, the passengers have a way to get to  Washington, and the pilot has an out to avoid being pressured  into continuing the flight if the conditions do not improve.  

Passengers can also be pilots. If no one is designated as pilot  in command (PIC) and unplanned circumstances arise, the  decision-making styles of several self-confident pilots may  come into conflict.  

Pilots also need to understand that non-pilots may not  understand the level of risk involved in flight. There is an  element of risk in every flight. That is why SRM calls it risk  management, not risk elimination. While a pilot may feel  comfortable with the risk present in a night IFR flight, the  passengers may not. A pilot employing SRM should ensure  the passengers are involved in the decision-making and given  tasks and duties to keep them busy and involved. If, upon a  factual description of the risks present, the passengers decide  to buy an airline ticket or rent a car, then a good decision has  generally been made. This discussion also allows the pilot  to move past what he or she thinks the passengers want to  do and find out what they actually want to do. This removes  self-induced pressure from the pilot.  

# The Programming  

The advanced avionics aircraft adds an entirely new  dimension to the way GA aircraft are flown. The electronic  instrument displays, GPS, and autopilot reduce pilot  workload and increase pilot situational awareness. While  programming and operation of these devices are fairly  simple and straightforward, unlike the analog instruments  they replace, they tend to capture the pilot’s attention and  hold it for long periods of time. To avoid this phenomenon,  the pilot should plan in advance when and where the  programming for approaches, route changes, and airport  information gathering should be accomplished, as well as  times it should not. Pilot familiarity with the equipment, the  route, the local ATC environment, and personal capabilities  vis  $\cdot\grave{\mathbf{a}}$  -vis the automation should drive when, where, and how  the automation is programmed and used.  

The pilot should also consider what his or her capabilities  are in response to last minute changes of the approach (and  the reprogramming required) and ability to make large-scale  changes (a reroute for instance) while hand flying the aircraft.  Since formats are not standardized, simply moving from one  manufacturer’s equipment to another should give the pilot  pause and require more conservative planning and decisions.  

The SRM process is simple. At least five times before  and during the flight, the pilot should review and consider  the “Plan, the Plane, the Pilot, the Passengers, and the  Programming” and make the appropriate decision required  by the current situation. It is often said that failure to make  a decision is a decision. Under SRM and the  $5\;\mathrm{Ps}$  , even the  decision to make no changes to the current plan is made  through a careful consideration of all the risk factors present.  

# Perceive, Process, Perform (3P) Model  

The Perceive, Process, Perform (3P) model for ADM offers  a simple, practical, and systematic approach that can be used  during all phases of flight. To use it, the pilot will:  

• 	 Perceive the given set of circumstances for a flight • 	 Process by evaluating their impact on flight safety • 	 Perform by implementing the best course of action  

Use the Perceive, Process, Perform, and Evaluate method as  a continuous model for every aeronautical decision that you  make. Although human beings will inevitably make mistakes,  anything that you can do to recognize and minimize potential  threats to your safety will make you a better pilot.  

Depending upon the nature of the activity and the time  available, risk management processing can take place in  any of three timeframes.  [Figure 2-10]  Most flight training  activities take place in the “time-critical” timeframe for  risk management. The six steps of risk management can be  combined into an easy-to-remember 3P model for practical  risk management: Perceive, Process, Perform with the PAVE,  CARE and TEAM checklists. Pilots can help perceive  hazards by using the PAVE checklist of: Pilot, Aircraft,  enVironment, and External pressures. They can process  hazards by using the CARE checklist of: Consequences,  Alternatives, Reality, External factors. Finally, pilots can  perform risk management by using the TEAM choice list  of: Transfer, Eliminate, Accept, or Mitigate.  

# PAVE Checklist: Identify Hazards and Personal  Minimums  

In the first step, the goal is to develop situational awareness  by perceiving hazards, which are present events, objects, or  circumstances that could contribute to an undesired future  event. In this step, the pilot will systematically identify and  

![](images/228721b5832754fc55426035473b4e4aa5c9b10f77852e9b5f0fe7ebe417101f.jpg)  
Figure 2-10.   Risk management processing can take place in any of three timeframes.  

list hazards associated with all aspects of the flight:  P ilot,  A ircraft, en V ironment, and  E xternal pressures, which makes  up the PAVE checklist.  [Figure 2-11]  For each element,  ask “what could hurt me, my passengers, or my aircraft?”  All four elements combine and interact to create a unique  situation for any flight. Pay special attention to the pilot- aircraft combination, and consider whether the combined  “pilot-aircraft team” is capable of the mission you want to fly.  For example, you may be a very experienced and proficient  pilot, but your weather flying ability is still limited if you  are flying a 1970s-model aircraft with no weather avoidance  gear. On the other hand, you may have a new technically  advanced aircraft with moving map GPS, weather datalink,  and autopilot—but if you do not have much weather flying  experience or practice in using this kind of equipment, you  cannot rely on the airplane’s capability to compensate for  your own lack of experience.  

# CARE Checklist: Review Hazards and Evaluate Risks  

In the second step, the goal is to process this information to  determine whether the identified hazards constitute risk, which  is defined as the future impact of a hazard that is not controlled  or eliminated. The degree of risk posed by a given hazard  can be measured in terms of exposure (number of people or  resources affected), severity (extent of possible loss), and  probability (the likelihood that a hazard will cause a loss). The  goal is to evaluate their impact on the safety of your flight,  and consider “why must I CARE about these circumstances?”  

For each hazard that you perceived in step one, process by  using the CARE checklist of:  C onsequences,  A lternatives,  R eality,  E xternal factors.  [Figure 2-12]  For example, let's  evaluate a night flight to attend a business meeting:  

C onsequences—departing after a full workday creates  fatigue and pressure  

A lternatives—delay until morning; reschedule  meeting; drive R eality —dangers and distractions of fatigue could  lead to an accident E xternal pressures—business meeting at destination  might influence me  

A good rule of thumb for the processing phase: if you find  yourself saying that it will “probably” be okay, it is definitely  time for a solid reality check. If you are worried about missing  a meeting, be realistic about how that pressure will affect  not just your initial go/no-go decision, but also your inflight  decisions to continue the flight or divert.  

# TEAM Checklist: Choose and Implement Risk  Controls  

Once you have perceived a hazard (step one) and processed  its impact on flight safety (step two), it is time to move to the  third step, perform. Perform risk management by using the  TEAM checklist of:  T ransfer,  E liminate,  A ccept,  M itigate  to deal with each factor.  [Figure 2-13]  

T ransfer—Should this risk decision be transferred to  someone else (e.g., do you need to consult the chief  flight instructor?)  

E liminate—Is there a way to eliminate the hazard?  

A ccept—Do the benefits of accepting risk outweigh  the costs?  

M itigate—What can you do to mitigate the risk?  

The goal is to perform by taking action to eliminate hazards  or mitigate risk, and then continuously evaluate the outcome  of this action. With the example of low ceilings at destination,  for instance, the pilot can perform good ADM by selecting  a suitable alternate, knowing where to find good weather,

# Pilots can perceive hazards by using the  CARE  checklist:  

# Pilot  

•  C onsequences: Gayle’s inexperience and lack of recent    flight time create some risks for an accident, primarily because    she plans to travel over mountains on a hazy day and land    at an unfamiliar mountain airport that is still in IMC    conditions.  •   A lternatives: Gayle might mitigate the pilot-related risk by    hiring a CFI to accompany her and provide dual cross-   country instruction. An added benefit is the opportunity to    broaden her flying experience in safe conditions.  •   R eality: Accepting the reality that limited experience can    create additional risks is a key part of sound risk management    and mitigation.  •  E xternal Factors: Like many pilots, Gayle must contend with    the emotional pressure associated with acknowledging that    her skill and experience levels may be lower than she would    like them to be. Pride can be a powerful external factor!  

# Environment  

•  C onsequences: For a pilot whose experience consists    mostly of local flights in good VMC, launching a long cross-   country flight over mountainous terrain in hazy conditions    could lead to pilot disorientation and increase the risk of an    accident.  •   A lternatives: Options include postponing the trip until the    visibility improves, or modifying the route to avoid extended    periods of time over the mountains.  •   R eality: Hazy conditions and mountainous terrain clearly    create risks for an inexperienced VFR-only pilot.  •   E xternal Factors: Few pilots are immune to the pressure of    “get-there-itis,” which can sometimes induce a decision to    launch or continue in less than ideal weather conditions.  

and carrying sufficient fuel to reach it. This course of action  would mitigate the risk. The pilot also has the option to  eliminate it entirely by waiting for better weather.  

Once the pilot has completed the 3P decision process and  selected a course of action, the process begins anew because  now the set of circumstances brought about by the course of  action requires analysis. The decision-making process is a  continuous loop of perceiving, processing, and performing. With practice and consistent use, running through the 3P  cycle can become a habit that is as smooth, continuous, and  automatic as a well-honed instrument scan. This basic set  of practical risk management tools can be used to improve  risk management.  

Your mental willingness to follow through on safe decisions,  especially those that require delay or diversion is critical. You  can bulk up your mental muscles by:  

# Aircraft  

•  C onsequences: This area presents low risk because the  

   aircraft is in excellent mechanical condition and Gayle is  

   familiar with its avionics. 

 •  A lternatives: Had there been a problem with her aircraft,  

   Gayle might have considered renting another plane from her  

   flight school. Bear in mind, however, that alternatives  

   sometimes create new hazards. In this instance, there may  

   be hazards associated with flying an unfamiliar aircraft with  

   different avionics.  

 •   R eality: It is important to recognize the reality of an aircraft’s  

   mechanical condition. If you find a maintenance discrepancy  

   and then find yourself saying that it is “probably” okay to fly  

   with it anyway, you need to revisit the consequences part of  

   this checklist.  

 •   E xternal Factors: Pilot decision-making can sometimes be  

   influenced by the external pressure of needing to return the  

   airplane to the FBO by a certain date and time. Because  

   Gayle owns the airplane, there was no such pressure in this  

   case.  

# External pressures  

•  C onsequences: Any number of factors can create the risk of 

   emotional pressure from a “get-there” mentality. In Gayle’s 

   case, the consequences of her strong desire to visit family, 

   her family’s expectations, and personal pride could induce 

   her to accept unnecessary risks. 

 •   A lternatives: Gayle clearly needs to develop a mitigating 

   strategy for each of the external factors associated with this 

   trip. 

 •   R eality: Pilots sometimes tend to discount or ignore the 

   potential impact of these external factors. Gayle’s open 

   acknowledgement of these factors (e.g., “I might be 

   pressured into pressing on so my mother won’t have to 

   worry about our late arrival.”) is a critical element of effective 

   risk management. 

 •   E xternal Factors: (see above)  

• 	 Using personal minimums checklist to make some  decisions in advance of the flight. To develop a good  personal minimums checklist, you need to assess your  abilities and capabilities in a non-flying environment,  when there is no pressure to make a specific trip. Once  developed, a personal minimums checklist will give  you a clear and concise reference point for making  your go/no-go or continue/discontinue decisions.

 • 	 In addition to having personal minimums, some pilots  also like to use a preflight risk assessment checklist to  help with the ADM and risk management processes.  This kind of form assigns numbers to certain risks  and situations, which can make it easier to see when  a particular flight involves a higher level of risk 

 • 	 Develop a list of good alternatives during your  processing phase. In marginal weather, for instance,  you might mitigate the risk by identifying a reasonable  

# Pilots can perform risk management by using the  TEAM  checklist:  

# Pilot  

To manage the risk associated with her inexperience and lack  of recent flight time, Gayle can: 

 •   T ransfer the risk entirely by having another pilot act as PIC. 

 •   E liminate the risk by canceling the trip. 

 •   A ccept the risk and fly anyway. 

 •   M itigate the risk by flying with another pilot.  

Gayle chooses to mitigate the major risk by hiring a CFI to  accompany her and provide dual cross-country instruction.  An added benefit is the opportunity to broaden her flying  experience.  

# Environment  

To manage the risk associated with hazy conditions and  mountainous terrain, Gayle can: 

 •  T ransfer the risk of VFR in these conditions by asking an 

   instrument-rated pilot to fly the trip under IFR. 

 •   E liminate the risk by canceling the trip. 

 •   A ccept the risk. 

 •   M itigate the risk by careful preflight planning, filing a VFR 

   flight plan, requesting VFR flight following, and using 

   resources such as Flight Watch.  

Detailed preflight planning must be a vital part of Gayle’s  weather risk mitigation strategy. The most direct route would  put her over mountains for most of the trip. Because of the  thick haze and pockets of IMC over mountains, Gayle might  mitigate the risk by modifying the route to fly over valleys. This  change will add 30 minutes to her estimated time of arrival  (ETA), but the extra time is a small price to pay for avoiding  possible IMC over mountains. Because her destination airport  is IMC at the time of departure, Gayle needs to establish that  VFR conditions exist at other airports within easy driving  distance of her original destination. In addition, Gayle should  review basic information (e.g., traffic pattern altitude, runway  layout, frequencies) for these alternate airports. To further  mitigate risk and practice good cockpit resource management,  Gayle should file a VFR flight plan, use VFR flight following,  and call Flight Watch to get weather updates en route. Finally,  basic functions on her handheld GPS should also be practiced.  

alternative airport for every 25–30 nautical mile  segment of your route.  

• 	 Preflight your passengers by preparing them for the  possibility of delay and diversion, and involve them  in your evaluation process.  

•	 Another important tool—overlooked by many pilots— is a good post-flight analysis. When you have safely  secured the airplane, take the time to review and  analyze the flight as objectively as you can. Mistakes  and judgment errors are inevitable; the most important  thing is for you to recognize, analyze, and learn from  them before your next flight.  

# Aircraft  

To manage risk associated with any doubts about the aircraft’s  mechanical condition, Gayle can: 

 •   T ransfer the risk by using a different airplane. 

 •   E liminate the risk by canceling the trip. 

 •   A ccept the risk. 

 •   M itigate the remaining (residual) risk through review of 

   aircraft performance and careful preflight inspection.  

Since she finds no problems with the aircraft’s mechanical  condition, Gayle chooses to mitigate any remaining risk  through careful preflight inspection of the aircraft.  

# External pressures  

To mitigate the risk of emotional pressure from family  expectations that can drive a “get-there” mentality, Gayle can: 

 •   T ransfer the risk by having her co-pilot act as PIC and make 

   the continue/divert decision. 

 •   E liminate the risk by canceling the trip. 

 •   A ccept the risk. 

 •   M itigate the risk by managing family expectations and 

   making alternative arrangements in the event of diversion to 

   another airport.  

Gayle and her co-pilot choose to address this risk by agreeing  that each pilot has a veto on continuing the flight, and that they  will divert if either becomes uncomfortable with flight conditions.  Because the destination airport is still IMC at the time of  departure, Gayle establishes a specific point in the trip—an en  route VORTAC located between the destination airport and the  two alternates—as the logical place for her “final” continue/ divert decision. Rather than give her family a specific ETA that  might make Gayle feel pressured to meet the schedule, she  manages her family’s expectations by advising them that she  will call when she arrives.  

# The DECIDE Model  

Using the acronym “DECIDE,” the six-step process DECIDE  Model is another continuous loop process that provides the  pilot with a logical way of making decisions.  [Figure 2-14] DECIDE means to Detect, Estimate, Choose a course of  action, Identify solutions, Do the necessary actions, and  Evaluate the effects of the actions.  

First, consider a recent accident involving a Piper Apache (PA- 23). The aircraft was substantially damaged during impact  with terrain at a local airport in Alabama. The certificated  airline transport pilot (ATP) received minor injuries and the  certificated private pilot was not injured. The private pilot  was receiving a checkride from the ATP (who was also a  designated examiner) for a commercial pilot certificate with  a multi-engine rating. After performing airwork at altitude,  they returned to the airport and the private pilot performed a  single-engine approach to a full stop landing. He then taxied  back for takeoff, performed a short field takeoff, and then  joined the traffic pattern to return for another landing. During  the approach for the second landing, the ATP simulated a right  engine failure by reducing power on the right engine to zero  thrust. This caused the aircraft to yaw right.  

The procedure to identify the failed engine is a two-step  process. First, adjust the power to the maximum controllable  level on both engines. Because the left engine is the only  engine delivering thrust, the yaw increases to the right, which  necessitates application of additional left rudder application.  

![](images/26959f34660b0a3f9466539cd2d75f4187990e92644a8687ef26df9f020f87fb.jpg)

The failed engine is the side that requires no rudder pressure,  in this case the right engine. Second, having identified the  failed right engine, the procedure is to feather the right engine  and adjust power to maintain descent angle to a landing.  

However, in this case the pilot feathered the left engine because  he assumed the engine failure was a left engine failure. During  twin-engine training, the left engine out is emphasized more  than the right engine because the left engine on most light  twins is the critical engine. This is due to multiengine airplanes  being subject to   $\mathrm{P}$  -factor, as are single-engine airplanes.  The descending propeller blade of each engine will produce  greater thrust than the ascending blade when the airplane is  operated under power and at positive angles of attack. The  descending propeller blade of the right engine is also a greater  distance from the center of gravity, and therefore has a longer  moment arm than the descending propeller blade of the left  engine. As a result, failure of the left engine will result in the  most asymmetrical thrust (adverse yaw) because the right  engine will be providing the remaining thrust. Many twins are  designed with a counter-rotating right engine. With this design,  the degree of asymmetrical thrust is the same with either engine  inoperative. Neither engine is more critical than the other.  

Since the pilot never executed the first step of identifying  which engine failed, he feathered the left engine and set the  right engine at zero thrust. This essentially restricted the  aircraft to a controlled glide. Upon realizing that he was  not going to make the runway, the pilot increased power to  both engines causing an enormous yaw to the left (the left  propeller was feathered) whereupon the aircraft started to turn  left. In desperation, the instructor closed both throttles and  the aircraft hit the ground and was substantially damaged.  

This case is interesting because it highlights two particular  issues. First, taking action without forethought can be just  as dangerous as taking no action at all. In this case, the  pilot’s actions were incorrect; yet, there was sufficient  time to take the necessary steps to analyze the simulated  emergency. The second and more subtle issue is that decisions  made under pressure are sometimes executed based upon  limited experience and the actions taken may be incorrect,  incomplete, or insufficient to handle the situation.  

# Detect (the Problem)  

Problem detection is the first step in the decision-making  process. It begins with recognizing a change occurred or an  expected change did not occur. A problem is perceived first  by the senses and then it is distinguished through insight  and experience. These same abilities, as well as an objective  analysis of all available information, are used to determine  the nature and severity of the problem. One critical error  made during the decision-making process is incorrectly  detecting the problem. In the previous example, the change  that occurred was a yaw.  

# Estimate (the Need To React)  

In the engine-out example, the aircraft yawed right, the pilot  was on final approach, and the problem warranted a prompt  solution. In many cases, overreaction and fixation excludes  a safe outcome. For example, what if the cabin door of a  Mooney suddenly opened in flight while the aircraft climbed  through 1,500 feet on a clear sunny day? The sudden opening  would be alarming, but the perceived hazard the open door  presents is quickly and effectively assessed as minor. In  fact, the door’s opening would not impact safe flight and  can almost be disregarded. Most likely, a pilot would return  to the airport to secure the door after landing.  

The pilot flying on a clear day faced with this minor problem  may rank the open cabin door as a low risk. What about  the pilot on an IFR climb out in IMC conditions with light  intermittent turbulence in rain who is receiving an amended  clearance from ATC? The open cabin door now becomes  a higher risk factor. The problem has not changed, but the  perception of risk a pilot assigns it changes because of the  multitude of ongoing tasks and the environment. Experience,  discipline, awareness, and knowledge influences how a pilot  ranks a problem.  

# Choose (a Course of Action)  

After the problem has been identified and its impact  estimated, the pilot must determine the desirable outcome  and choose a course of action. In the case of the multiengine  pilot given the simulated failed engine, the desired objective  is to safely land the airplane.  

# Identify (Solutions)  

The pilot formulates a plan that will take him or her to the  objective. Sometimes, there may be only one course of action  available. In the case of the engine failure already at 500  feet or below, the pilot solves the problem by identifying  one or more solutions that lead to a successful outcome. It is  important for the pilot not to become fixated on the process  to the exclusion of making a decision.  

# Do (the Necessary Actions)  

Once pathways to resolution are identified, the pilot selects the  most suitable one for the situation. The multiengine pilot given  the simulated failed engine must now safely land the aircraft.  

# Evaluate (the Effect of the Action)  

Finally, after implementing a solution, evaluate the decision  to see if it was correct. If the action taken does not provide  the desired results, the process may have to be repeated.  

# Decision-Making in a Dynamic Environment  

A solid approach to decision-making is through the use of  analytical models, such as the 5 Ps, 3P, and DECIDE. Good  decisions result when pilots gather all available information,  review it, analyze the options, rate the options, select a course  of action, and evaluate that course of action for correctness.  

In some situations, there is not always time to make decisions  based on analytical decision-making skills. A good example  is a quarterback whose actions are based upon a highly fluid  and changing situation. He intends to execute a plan, but new  circumstances dictate decision-making on the fly. This type  of decision-making is called automatic decision-making or  naturalized decision-making.  [Figure 2-14B]  

# Automatic Decision-Making  

In an emergency situation, a pilot might not survive if he or  she rigorously applies analytical models to every decision  made as there is not enough time to go through all the options.  Under these circumstances he or she should attempt to find  the best possible solution to every problem.  

For the past several decades, research into how people  actually make decisions has revealed that when pressed for  time, experts faced with a task loaded with uncertainty first  assess whether the situation strikes them as familiar. Rather  than comparing the pros and cons of different approaches,  they quickly imagine how one or a few possible courses of  action in such situations will play out. Experts take the first  workable option they can find. While it may not be the best of  all possible choices, it often yields remarkably good results.  

The terms “naturalistic” and “automatic decision-making”  have been coined to describe this type of decision-making.  The ability to make automatic decisions holds true for a  range of experts from firefighters to chess players. It appears  the expert’s ability hinges on the recognition of patterns and  consistencies that clarify options in complex situations. Experts  appear to make provisional sense of a situation, without  actually reaching a decision, by launching experience-based  actions that in turn trigger creative revisions.  

This is a reflexive type of decision-making anchored in  training and experience and is most often used in times of  emergencies when there is no time to practice analytical  decision-making. Naturalistic or automatic decision-making  improves with training and experience, and a pilot will find  himself or herself using a combination of decision-making  tools that correlate with individual experience and training.  

# Operational Pitfalls  

Although more experienced pilots are likely to make more  automatic decisions, there are tendencies or operational  pitfalls that come with the development of pilot experience.  These are classic behavioral traps into which pilots have  been known to fall. More experienced pilots, as a rule, try  to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, and meet  schedules. The desire to meet these goals can have an adverse  effect on safety and contribute to an unrealistic assessment  of piloting skills. All experienced pilots have fallen prey to,  or have been tempted by, one or more of these tendencies in  their flying careers. These dangerous tendencies or behavior  patterns, which must be identified and eliminated, include  the operational pitfalls shown in  Figure 2-15.  

# Stress Management  

Everyone is stressed to some degree almost all of the time. A  certain amount of stress is good since it keeps a person alert  and prevents complacency. Effects of stress are cumulative  and, if the pilot does not cope with them in an appropriate  way, they can eventually add up to an intolerable burden.  Performance generally increases with the onset of stress,  peaks, and then begins to fall off rapidly as stress levels  exceed a person’s ability to cope. The ability to make  effective decisions during flight can be impaired by stress.  There are two categories of stress—acute and chronic. These  are both explained in Chapter 17, “Aeromedical Factors.”  

Factors referred to as stressors can increase a pilot’s risk of  error in the flight deck.  [Figure 2-16]  Remember the cabin  door that suddenly opened in flight on the Mooney climbing  through 1,500 feet on a clear sunny day? It may startle the  pilot, but the stress would wane when it became apparent  the situation was not a serious hazard. Yet, if the cabin door  opened in IMC conditions, the stress level makes significant  impact on the pilot’s ability to cope with simple tasks. The  key to stress management is to stop, think, and analyze before  jumping to a conclusion. There is usually time to think before  drawing unnecessary conclusions.  

There are several techniques to help manage the accumulation  of life stresses and prevent stress overload. For example, to  help reduce stress levels, set aside time for relaxation each  day or maintain a program of physical fitness. To prevent  stress overload, learn to manage time more effectively to  avoid pressures imposed by getting behind schedule and not  meeting deadlines.  

# Use of Resources  

To make informed decisions during flight operations, a pilot  must also become aware of the resources found inside and  outside the flight deck. Since useful tools and sources of  information may not always be readily apparent, learning  to recognize these resources is an essential part of ADM  training. Resources must not only be identified, but a pilot  must also develop the skills to evaluate whether there is  

# Operational pitfalls  

# Peer pressure  

Poor decision-making may be based upon an emotional response to peers, rather than evaluating a situation objectively.  

Mindset  

A pilot displays mind set through an inability to recognize and cope with changes in a given situation.  

Get-there-itis  

This disposition impairs pilot judgment through a fixation on the original goal or destination, combined with a disregard for any  alternative course of action.  

# Duck-under syndrome  

A pilot may be tempted to make it into an airport by descending below minimums during an approach. There may be a belief that  there is a built-in margin of error in every approach procedure, or a pilot may want to admit that the landing cannot be completed  and a missed approach must be initiated.  

# Scud running  

This occurs when a pilot tries to maintain visual contact with the terrain at low altitudes while instrument conditions exist.  

Continuing visual flight rules (VFR) into instrument conditions Spatial disorientation or collision with ground/obstacles may occur when a pilot continues VFR into instrument conditions. This can  be even more dangerous if the pilot is not instrument rated or current.  

# Getting behind the aircraft  

This pitfall can be caused by allowing events or the situation to control pilot actions. A constant state of surprise at what happens  next may be exhibited when the pilot is getting behind the aircraft.  

# Loss of positional or situational awareness  

In extreme cases, when a pilot gets behind the aircraft, a loss of positional or situational awareness may result. The pilot may not  know the aircraft’s geographical location or may be unable to recognize deteriorating circumstances.  

# Operating without adequate fuel reserves  

Ignoring minimum fuel reserve requirements is generally the result of overconfidence, lack of flight planning, or disregarding  applicable regulations.  

Descent below the minimum en route altitude The duck-under syndrome, as mentioned above, can also occur during the en route portion of an IFR flight.  

Flying outside the envelope  

The assumed high performance capability of a particular aircraft may cause a mistaken belief that it can meet the demands  imposed by a pilot’s overestimated flying skills.  

# Neglect of flight planning, preflight inspections, and checklists  

A pilot may rely on short- and long-term memory, regular flying skills, and familiar routes instead of established procedures and  published checklists. This can be particularly true of experienced pilots.  

Figure 2-15.   Typical operational pitfalls requiring pilot awareness.  

# Stressors  

# Environmental  

Conditions associated with the environment, such as temperature and humidity extremes, noise, vibration, and lack of oxygen.  

# Physiological stress  

Physical conditions, such as fatigue, lack of physical fitness, sleep loss, missed meals (leading to low blood sugar levels), and  illness.  

# Psychological stress  

Social or emotional factors, such as a death in the family, a divorce, a sick child, or a demotion at work. This type of stress may  also be related to mental workload, such as analyzing a problem, navigating an aircraft, or making decisions.  

Figure 2-16.   System stressors. Environmental, physiological, and psychological stress are factors that affect decision-making skills.  These stressors have a profound impact especially during periods of high workload.  

time to use a particular resource and the impact its use will  have upon the safety of flight. For example, the assistance  of ATC may be very useful if a pilot becomes lost, but in  an emergency situation, there may be no time available to  contact ATC.  

# Internal Resources  

One of the most underutilized resources may be the  person in the right seat, even if the passenger has no flying  experience. When appropriate, the PIC can ask passengers  to assist with certain tasks, such as watching for traffic or  reading checklist items. The following are some other ways  a passenger can assist:  

• 	 Provide information in an irregular situation,  especially if familiar with flying. A strange smell or  sound may alert a passenger to a potential problem.  • 	 Confirm after the pilot that the landing gear is down.  • 	 Learn to look at the altimeter for a given altitude in a  descent. • 	 Listen to logic or lack of logic.  

Also, the process of a verbal briefing (which can happen  whether or not passengers are aboard) can help the PIC in  the decision-making process. For example, assume a pilot  provides a lone passenger a briefing of the forecast landing  weather before departure. When the Automatic Terminal  Information Service (ATIS) is picked up, the weather  has significantly changed. The discussion of this forecast  change can lead the pilot to reexamine his or her activities  and decision-making.  [Figure 2-17]  Other valuable internal  resources include ingenuity, aviation knowledge, and flying  skill. Pilots can increase flight deck resources by improving  these characteristics.  

When flying alone, another internal resource is verbal  communication. It has been established that verbal  communication reinforces an activity; touching an object  while communicating further enhances the probability an  activity has been accomplished. For this reason, many solo  pilots read the checklist out loud; when they reach critical  items, they touch the switch or control. For example, to  ascertain the landing gear is down, the pilot can read the  checklist. But, if he or she touches the gear handle during the  process, a safe extension of the landing gear is confirmed.  

It is necessary for a pilot to have a thorough understanding  of all the equipment and systems in the aircraft being flown.  Lack of knowledge, such as knowing if the oil pressure  gauge is direct reading or uses a sensor, is the difference  between making a wise decision or poor one that leads to  a tragic error.  

![](images/fb44971ca851e1be5852a253fa8c67df18bc001ca0897c170494922ba0187997.jpg)  
Figure 2-17.  When possible, have a passenger reconfirm that critical  tasks are completed.  

Checklists are essential flight deck internal resources. They  are used to verify the aircraft instruments and systems are  checked, set, and operating properly, as well as ensuring  the proper procedures are performed if there is a system  malfunction or in-flight emergency. Students reluctant to  use checklists can be reminded that pilots at all levels of  experience refer to checklists, and that the more advanced the  aircraft is, the more crucial checklists become. In addition, the  pilot’s operating handbook (POH) is required to be carried on  board the aircraft and is essential for accurate flight planning  and resolving in-flight equipment malfunctions. However,  the most valuable resource a pilot has is the ability to manage  workload whether alone or with others.  

# External Resources  

ATC and flight service specialists are the best external  resources during flight. In order to promote the safe, orderly  flow of air traffic around airports and, along flight routes, the  ATC provides pilots with traffic advisories, radar vectors,  and assistance in emergency situations. Although it is the  PIC’s responsibility to make the flight as safe as possible,  a pilot with a problem can request assistance from ATC.  [Figure 2-18]  For example, if a pilot needs to level off, be  

![](images/caa29e61efa297bbfb6e6b48d317a73802bded345d41a72d7fb7a31eca0744c0.jpg)  
Figure 2-18.   Controllers work to make flights as safe as possible.  

given a vector, or decrease speed, ATC assists and becomes  integrated as part of the crew. The services provided by ATC  can not only decrease pilot workload, but also help pilots  make informed in-flight decisions.  

The Flight Service Stations (FSSs) are air traffic facilities  that provide pilot briefing, en route communications, VFR  search and rescue services, assist lost aircraft and aircraft  in emergency situations, relay ATC clearances, originate  Notices to Airmen (NOTAM), broadcast aviation weather  and National Airspace System (NAS) information, receive  and process IFR flight plans, and monitor navigational aids  (NAVAIDs). In addition, at selected locations, FSSs provide  En Route Flight Advisory Service (Flight Watch), issue  airport advisories, and advise Customs and Immigration of  transborder flights. Selected FSSs in Alaska also provide  TWEB recordings and take weather observations.  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is the accurate perception and  understanding of all the factors and conditions within  the five fundamental risk elements (flight, pilot, aircraft,  environment, and type of operation that comprise any given  aviation situation) that affect safety before, during, and after  the flight. Monitoring radio communications for traffic,  weather discussion, and ATC communication can enhance  situational awareness by helping the pilot develop a mental  picture of what is happening.  

Maintaining situational awareness requires an understanding  of the relative significance of all flight related factors and their  future impact on the flight. When a pilot understands what is  going on and has an overview of the total operation, he or she  is not fixated on one perceived significant factor. Not only  is it important for a pilot to know the aircraft’s geographical  location, it is also important he or she understand what is  happening. For instance, while flying above Richmond,  Virginia, toward Dulles Airport or Leesburg, the pilot  should know why he or she is being vectored and be able to  anticipate spatial location. A pilot who is simply making turns  without understanding why has added an additional burden  to his or her management in the event of an emergency. To  maintain situational awareness, all of the skills involved in  ADM are used.  

# Obstacles to Maintaining Situational Awareness  

Fatigue, stress, and work overload can cause a pilot to fixate  on a single perceived important item and reduce an overall  situational awareness of the flight. A contributing factor  in many accidents is a distraction that diverts the pilot’s  attention from monitoring the instruments or scanning  outside the aircraft. Many flight deck distractions begin as a  minor problem, such as a gauge that is not reading correctly,  but result in accidents as the pilot diverts attention to the  perceived problem and neglects proper control of the aircraft.  

# Workload Management  

Effective workload management ensures essential operations  are accomplished by planning, prioritizing, and sequencing  tasks to avoid work overload.  [Figure 2-19]  As experience  is gained, a pilot learns to recognize future workload  requirements and can prepare for high workload periods  during times of low workload. Reviewing the appropriate  chart and setting radio frequencies well in advance of when  they are needed helps reduce workload as the flight nears the  airport. In addition, a pilot should listen to ATIS, Automated  Surface Observing System (ASOS), or Automated Weather  Observing System (AWOS), if available, and then monitor  the tower frequency or Common Traffic Advisory Frequency  (CTAF) to get a good idea of what traffic conditions to  expect. Checklists should be performed well in advance so  there is time to focus on traffic and ATC instructions. These  procedures are especially important prior to entering a high- density traffic area, such as Class B airspace.  

Recognizing a work overload situation is also an important  component of managing workload. The first effect of  high workload is that the pilot may be working harder but  accomplishing less. As workload increases, attention cannot  be devoted to several tasks at one time, and the pilot may  begin to focus on one item. When a pilot becomes task  saturated, there is no awareness of input from various sources,  so decisions may be made on incomplete information and the  possibility of error increases.  [Figure 2-20]  

When a work overload situation exists, a pilot needs to stop,  think, slow down, and prioritize. It is important to understand  how to decrease workload. For example, in the case of the  cabin door that opened in VFR flight, the impact on workload  should be insignificant. If the cabin door opens under  IFR different conditions, its impact on workload changes.  Therefore, placing a situation in the proper perspective,

Figure 2-19.   Balancing workloads can be a difficult task.  

remaining calm, and thinking rationally are key elements in  reducing stress and increasing the capacity to fly safely. This  ability depends upon experience, discipline, and training.  

# Managing Risks  

The ability to manage risks begins with preparation. Here  are some things a pilot can do to manage risks:  

•	 Assess the flight’s risk based upon experience. Use  some form of risk assessment. For example, if the  weather is marginal and the pilot has little IMC  training, it is probably a good idea to cancel the flight. •	 Brief passengers using the SAFETY list: S  	 Seat belts fastened for taxi, takeoff, landing 	 Shoulder harness fastened for takeoff, landing 	 Seat position adjusted and locked in place A 	 Air vents (location and operation) 	 All environmental controls (discussed) 	 Action in case of any passenger discomfort F 	 Fire extinguisher (location and operation) E 	 Exit doors (how to secure; how to open) 	 Emergency evacuation plan 	 Emergency/survival kit (location and contents) T 	 Traffic (scanning, spotting, notifying pilot) 	 Talking, (“sterile flight deck” expectations) Y 	 Your questions? (Speak up!)  

•	 In addition to the SAFETY list, discuss with  passengers whether or not smoking is permitted, flight  route altitudes, time en route, destination, weather  during flight, expected weather at the destination,  controls and what they do, and the general capabilities  and limitations of the aircraft. •	 Use a sterile flight deck (one that is completely silent  with no pilot communication with passengers or by  passengers) from the time of departure to the first  intermediate altitude and clearance from the local  airspace.  •	 Use a sterile flight deck during arrival from the first  radar vector for approach or descent for the approach. •	 Keep the passengers informed during times when the  workload is low. •	 Consider using the passenger in the right seat for  simple tasks, such as holding the chart. This relieves  the pilot of a task.  

# Automation  

In the GA community, an automated aircraft is generally  comprised of an integrated advanced avionics system  consisting of a primary flight display (PFD), a multifunction  flight display (MFD) including an instrument-certified global  positioning system (GPS) with traffic and terrain graphics,  and a fully integrated autopilot. This type of aircraft is  commonly known as a technically advanced aircraft (TAA).  In a TAA aircraft, there are typically two display (computer)  screens: PFD (left display screen) and MFD.  

![](images/7eda2f7ee856e4a4116074359e7c3f1cd38995342a7475a29272fca7c4f53d7a.jpg)  
Figure 2-20.   The pilot has a certain capacity of doing work and handling tasks. However, there is a point where the tasking exceeds the  pilot’s capability. When this happens, tasks are either not performed properly or some are not performed at all.  

Automation is the single most important advance in aviation  technologies. Electronic flight displays (EFDs) have made  vast improvements in how information is displayed and  what information is available to the pilot. Pilots can access  electronic databases that contain all of the information  traditionally contained in multiple handbooks, reducing  clutter in the flight deck.  [Figure 2-21]  

MFDs are capable of displaying moving maps that mirror  sectional charts. These detailed displays depict all airspace,  including Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs). MFDs are  so descriptive that many pilots fall into the trap of relying  solely on the moving maps for navigation. Pilots also draw  upon the database to familiarize themselves with departure  and destination airport information.  

More pilots now rely on electronic databases for flight  planning and use automated flight planning tools rather  than planning the flight by the traditional methods of laying  out charts, drawing the course, identifying navigation  points (assuming a VFR flight), and using the POH to  figure out the weight and balance and performance charts.  Whichever method a pilot chooses to plan a flight, it is  

![](images/6a1dd54770506af8231664226b6d560cc7ac5d245fc227205880e6e675bf3cc4.jpg)  
Figure 2-21.   Electronic flight instrumentation comes in many  systems and provides a myriad of information to the pilot.  

important to remember to check and confirm calculations.  Always remember that it is up to the pilot to maintain basic  airmanship skills and use those skills often to maintain  proficiency in all tasks.  

Although automation has made flying safer, automated  systems can make some errors more evident and sometimes  hide other errors or make them less evident. There are  concerns about the effect of automation on pilots. In a study  published in 1995, the British Airline Pilots Association  officially voiced its concern that “Airline pilots increasingly  lack ‘basic flying skills’ as a result of reliance on automation.”  

This reliance on automation translates into a lack of basic flying  skills that may affect the pilot’s ability to cope with an in-flight  emergency, such as sudden mechanical failure. The worry that  pilots are becoming too reliant on automated systems and are  not being encouraged or trained to fly manually has grown  with the increase in the number of MFD flight decks.  

As automated flight decks began entering everyday line  operations, instructors and check airmen grew concerned  about some of the unanticipated side effects. Despite the  promise of reducing human mistakes, the flight managers  reported the automation actually created much larger errors  at times. In the terminal environment, the workload in an  automated flight deck actually seemed higher than in the older  analog flight decks. At other times, the automation seemed  to lull the flight crews into complacency. Over time, concern  surfaced that the manual flying skills of the automated flight  crews deteriorated due to over-reliance on computers. The  flight crew managers said they worried that pilots would  have less “stick-and-rudder” proficiency when those skills  were needed to manually resume direct control of the aircraft.  

A major study was conducted to evaluate the performance  of two groups of pilots. The control group was composed of  pilots who flew an older version of a common twin-jet airliner  equipped with analog instrumentation and the experimental  group was composed of pilots who flew the same aircraft,  but newer models equipped with an electronic flight  instrument system (EFIS) and a flight management system  (FMS). The pilots were evaluated in maintaining aircraft  parameters, such as heading, altitude, airspeed, glideslope,  and localizer deviations, as well as pilot control inputs. These  were recorded during a variety of normal, abnormal, and  emergency maneuvers during 4 hours of simulator sessions.  

# Results of the Study  

When pilots who had flown EFIS for several years were  required to fly various maneuvers manually, the aircraft  parameters and flight control inputs clearly showed some  erosion of flying skills. During normal maneuvers, such as  turns to headings without a flight director, the EFIS group  exhibited somewhat greater deviations than the analog group.  Most of the time, the deviations were within the practical test  standards (PTS), but the pilots definitely did not keep on the  localizer and glideslope as smoothly as the analog group.  

The differences in hand-flying skills between the two groups  became more significant during abnormal maneuvers, such as  accelerated descent profiles known as “slam-dunks.” When  given close crossing restrictions, the analog crews were more  adept at the mental math and usually maneuvered the aircraft  in a smoother manner to make the restriction. On the other  hand, the EFIS crews tended to go “heads down” and tried  to solve the crossing restriction on the FMS.  [Figure 2-22]  

Another situation used in the simulator experiment reflected  real world changes in approach that are common and can  be assigned on short notice. Once again, the analog crews  transitioned more easily to the parallel runway’s localizer,  whereas the EFIS crews had a much more difficult time with  the pilot going head down for a significant amount of time  trying to program the new approach into the FMS.  

While a pilot’s lack of familiarity with the EFIS is often  an issue, the approach would have been made easier by  disengaging the automated system and manually flying the  approach. At the time of this study, the general guidelines  in the industry were to let the automated system do as much  of the flying as possible. That view has since changed and  it is recommended that pilots use their best judgment when  choosing which level of automation will most efficiently do  the task considering the workload and situational awareness.  

Emergency maneuvers clearly broadened the difference in  manual flying skills between the two groups. In general, the  analog pilots tended to fly raw data, so when they were given  an emergency, such as an engine failure, and were instructed  to fly the maneuver without a flight director, they performed  it expertly. By contrast, SOP for EFIS operations at the time  was to use the flight director. When EFIS crews had their flight  directors disabled, their eye scan again began a more erratic  searching pattern and their manual flying subsequently suffered.  

Those who reviewed the data saw that the EFIS pilots who  better managed the automation also had better flying skills.  While the data did not reveal whether those skills preceded  or followed automation, it did indicate that automation  management needed to be improved. Recommended “best  practices” and procedures have remedied some of the earlier  problems with automation.  

Pilots must maintain their flight skills and ability to maneuver  aircraft manually within the standards set forth in the PTS. It  is recommended that pilots of automated aircraft occasionally  disengage the automation and manually fly the aircraft to  maintain stick-and-rudder proficiency. It is imperative that  the pilots understand that the EFD adds to the overall quality  of the flight experience, but it can also lead to catastrophe if  not utilized properly. At no time is the moving map meant to  substitute for a VFR sectional or low altitude en route chart.  

# Equipment Use Autopilot Systems  

In a single-pilot environment, an autopilot system can greatly  reduce workload.  [Figure 2-23]  As a result, the pilot is free  to focus his or her attention on other flight deck duties. This  can improve situational awareness and reduce the possibility  of a CFIT accident. While the addition of an autopilot may  certainly be considered a risk control measure, the real  challenge comes in determining the impact of an inoperative  unit. If the autopilot is known to be inoperative prior to  departure, this may factor into the evaluation of other risks.  

For example, the pilot may be planning for a VHF  omnidirectional range (VOR) approach down to minimums  on a dark night into an unfamiliar airport. In such a case, the  pilot may have been relying heavily on a functioning autopilot  capable of flying a coupled approach. This would free the  pilot to monitor aircraft performance. A malfunctioning  autopilot could be the single factor that takes this from a  medium to a serious risk. At this point, an alternative needs  to be considered. On the other hand, if the autopilot were to  fail at a critical (high workload) portion of this same flight,  the pilot must be prepared to take action. Instead of simply  being an inconvenience, this could quickly turn into an  emergency if not properly handled. The best way to ensure  a pilot is prepared for such an event is to carefully study the  issue prior to departure and determine well in advance how  an autopilot failure is to be handled.  

# Familiarity  

As previously discussed, pilot familiarity with all equipment  is critical in optimizing both safety and efficiency. If a pilot is  unfamiliar with any aircraft systems, this will add to workload  and may contribute to a loss of situational awareness. This  level of proficiency is critical and should be looked upon as  a requirement, not unlike carrying an adequate supply of fuel.  As a result, pilots should not look upon unfamiliarity with the  aircraft and its systems as a risk control measure, but instead as  a hazard with high risk potential. Discipline is key to success.  

![](images/b026ed8f81d9310569c47c6a9f97f0ddb6623526b09778d73e7b0562c5811430.jpg)  
Figure 2-22.   Two similar flight decks equipped with the same information two different ways, analog and digital. What are they indicating?  Chances are that the analog pilot will review the top display before the bottom display. Conversely, the digitally trained pilot will review  the instrument panel on the bottom first.

Figure 2-23.  An example of an autopilot system.  

# Respect for Onboard Systems  

Automation can assist the pilot in many ways, but a  thorough understanding of the system(s) in use is essential  to gaining the benefits it can offer. Understanding leads  to respect, which is achieved through discipline and the  mastery of the onboard systems. It is important to fly the  aircraft using minimal information from the primary flight  display (PFD). This includes turns, climbs, descents, and  being able to fly approaches.  

# Reinforcement of Onboard Suites  

The use of an EFD may not seem intuitive, but competency  becomes better with understanding and practice. Computer- based software and incremental training help the pilot become  comfortable with the onboard suites. Then the pilot needs  to practice what was learned in order to gain experience.  Reinforcement not only yields dividends in the use of  automation, it also reduces workload significantly.  

# Getting Beyond Rote Workmanship  

The key to working effectively with automation is getting  beyond the sequential process of executing an action. If a  pilot has to analyze what key to push next, or always uses  the same sequence of keystrokes when others are available,  he or she may be trapped in a rote process. This mechanical  process indicates a shallow understanding of the system.  Again, the desire is to become competent and know what to  do without having to think about, “what keystroke is next.”  Operating the system with competency and comprehension  benefits a pilot when situations become more diverse and  tasks increase.  

# Understand the Platform  

Contrary to popular belief, flight in aircraft equipped with  different electronic management suites requires the same  attention as aircraft equipped with analog instrumentation  and a conventional suite of avionics. The pilot should review  and understand the different ways in which EFD are used in  a particular aircraft.  [Figure 2-24]  

The following are two simple rules for use of an EFD:  

• 	 Be able to fly the aircraft to the standards in the PTS.  Although this may seem insignificant, knowing how to  fly the aircraft to a standard makes a pilot’s airmanship  smoother and allows him or her more time to attend  to the system instead of managing multiple tasks. • 	 Read and understand the installed electronic flight  systems manuals to include the use of the autopilot  and the other onboard electronic management tools.  

# Managing Aircraft Automation  

Before any pilot can master aircraft automation, he or she  must first know how to fly the aircraft. Maneuvers training  remains an important component of flight training because  almost 40 percent of all GA accidents take place in the  

![](images/6e7b5571f1353ca9c6b5bed25b55ad31145731d5ccd8da6f29645c5d36b565cd.jpg)

landing phase, one realm of flight that still does not involve  programming a computer to execute. Another 15 percent  of all GA accidents occurs during takeoff and initial climb.  

An advanced avionics safety issue identified by the FAA  concerns pilots who apparently develop an unwarranted  over-reliance in their avionics and the aircraft, believing  that the equipment will compensate for pilot shortcomings.  Related to the over-reliance is the role of ADM, which is  probably the most significant factor in the GA accident record  of high performance aircraft used for cross-country flight.  The FAA advanced avionics aircraft safety study found that  poor decision-making seems to afflict new advanced avionics  pilots at a rate higher than that of GA as a whole. The review  of advanced avionics accidents cited in this study shows the  majority are not caused by something directly related to the  aircraft, but by the pilot’s lack of experience and a chain of  poor decisions. One consistent theme in many of the fatal  accidents is continued VFR flight into IMC.  

Thus, pilot skills for normal and emergency operations hinge  not only on mechanical manipulation of the stick and rudder,  but also include the mental mastery of the EFD. Three key  flight management skills are needed to fly the advanced  avionics safely: information, automation, and risk.  

# Information Management  

For the newly transitioning pilot, the PFD, MFD, and GPS/ VHF navigator screens seem to offer too much information  presented in colorful menus and submenus. In fact, the pilot  may be drowning in information but unable to find a specific  piece of information. It might be helpful to remember these  systems are similar to computers that store some folders on  a desktop and some within a hierarchy.  

The first critical information management skill for flying with  advanced avionics is to understand the system at a conceptual  level. Remembering how the system is organized helps the  pilot manage the available information. It is important to  understanding that learning knob-and-dial procedures is not  enough. Learning more about how advanced avionics systems  work leads to better memory for procedures and allows pilots  to solve problems they have not seen before.  

There are also limits to understanding. It is generally impossible  to understand all of the behaviors of a complex avionics  system. Knowing to expect surprises and to continually learn  new things is more effective than attempting to memorize  mechanical manipulation of the knobs. Simulation software  and books on the specific system used are of great value.  

The second critical information management skill is stop,  look, and read. Pilots new to advanced avionics often become  fixated on the knobs and try to memorize each and every  sequence of button pushes, pulls, and turns. A far better  strategy for accessing and managing the information available  in advanced avionics computers is to stop, look, and read.  Reading before pushing, pulling, or twisting can often save  a pilot some trouble.  

Once behind the display screens on an advanced avionics  aircraft, the pilot’s goal is to meter, manage, and prioritize  the information flow to accomplish specific tasks.  Certificated flight instructors (CFIs), as well as pilots  transitioning to advanced avionics, will find it helpful to  corral the information flow. This is possible through such  tactics as configuring the aspects of the PFD and MFD  screens according to personal preferences. For example,  most systems offer map orientation options that include 

 “north up,” “track up,” “DTK” (desired track up), and 

 “heading up.” Another tactic is to decide, when possible,  how much (or how little) information to display. Pilots can  also tailor the information displayed to suit the needs of a  specific flight.  

Information flow can also be managed for a specific  operation. The pilot has the ability to prioritize information  for a timely display of exactly the information needed for any  given flight operation. Examples of managing information  display for a specific operation include:  

• 	 Program map scale settings for en route versus  terminal area operation. • 	 Utilize the terrain awareness page on the MFD for a  night or IMC flight in or near the mountains. • 	 Use the nearest airports inset on the PFD at night or  over inhospitable terrain. • 	 Program the weather datalink set to show echoes and  METAR status flags.  

# Enhanced Situational Awareness  

An advanced avionics aircraft offers increased safety with  enhanced situational awareness. Although aircraft flight  manuals (AFM) explicitly prohibit using the moving map,  topography, terrain awareness, traffic, and weather datalink  displays as the primary data source, these tools nonetheless  give the pilot unprecedented information for enhanced  situational awareness. Without a well-planned information  management strategy, these tools also make it easy for an  unwary pilot to slide into the complacent role of passenger  in command.  

Consider the pilot whose navigational information  management strategy consists solely of following the  magenta line on the moving map. He or she can easily fly  into geographic or regulatory disaster, if the straight-line GPS  course goes through high terrain or prohibited airspace, or if  the moving map display fails.  

A good strategy for maintaining situational awareness  information management should include practices that help  ensure that awareness is enhanced, not diminished, by the use  of automation. Two basic procedures are to always double- check the system and verbal callouts. At a minimum, ensure  the presentation makes sense. Was the correct destination fed  into the navigation system? Callouts—even for single-pilot  operations—are an excellent way to maintain situational  awareness, as well as manage information.  

Other ways to maintain situational awareness include:  

• 	 Perform verification check of all programming. Before  departure, check all information programmed while  on the ground.  • 	 Check the flight routing. Before departure, ensure all  routing matches the planned flight route. Enter the  planned route and legs, to include headings and leg  length, on a paper log. Use this log to evaluate what  has been programmed. If the two do not match, do not  assume the computer data is correct, double check the  computer entry.  •	 Verify waypoints.  • 	 Make use of all onboard navigation equipment. For  example, use VOR to back up GPS and vice versa. •	 Match the use of the automated system with pilot  proficiency. Stay within personal limitations.  •	 Plan a realistic flight route to maintain situational  awareness. For example, although the onboard  equipment allows a direct flight from Denver,  Colorado, to Destin, Florida, the likelihood of  rerouting around Eglin Air Force Base’s airspace is  high.  •	 Be ready to verify computer data entries. For example,  incorrect keystrokes could lead to loss of situational  awareness because the pilot may not recognize errors  made during a high workload period.  

# Automation Management  

Advanced avionics offer multiple levels of automation, from  strictly manual flight to highly automated flight. No one level  of automation is appropriate for all flight situations, but in  order to avoid potentially dangerous distractions when flying  with advanced avionics, the pilot must know how to manage  the course deviation indicator (CDI), the navigation source,  and the autopilot. It is important for a pilot to know the  peculiarities of the particular automated system being used.  This ensures the pilot knows what to expect, how to monitor  for proper operation, and promptly take appropriate action if  the system does not perform as expected.  

For example, at the most basic level, managing the autopilot  means knowing at all times which modes are engaged  and which modes are armed to engage. The pilot needs to  verify that armed functions (e.g., navigation tracking or  altitude capture) engage at the appropriate time. Automation  management is another good place to practice the callout  technique, especially after arming the system to make a  change in course or altitude.  

In advanced avionics aircraft, proper automation management  also requires a thorough understanding of how the autopilot  interacts with the other systems. For example, with some  autopilots, changing the navigation source on the e-HSI from  GPS to LOC or VOR while the autopilot is engaged in NAV  (course tracking mode) causes the autopilot’s NAV mode to  disengage. The autopilot’s lateral control will default to ROL  (wing level) until the pilot takes action to reengage the NAV  mode to track the desired navigation source.  

# Risk Management  

Risk management is the last of the three flight management  skills needed for mastery of the glass flight deck aircraft. The  enhanced situational awareness and automation capabilities  offered by a glass flight deck airplane vastly expand its safety  and utility, especially for personal transportation use. At the  same time, there is some risk that lighter workloads could  lead to complacency.  

Humans are characteristically poor monitors of automated  systems. When asked to passively monitor an automated  system for faults, abnormalities, or other infrequent events,  humans perform poorly. The more reliable the system, the  poorer the human performance. For example, the pilot only  monitors a backup alert system, rather than the situation  that the alert system is designed to safeguard. It is a paradox  of automation that technically advanced avionics can both  increase and decrease pilot awareness.  

It is important to remember that EFDs do not replace basic  flight knowledge and skills. They are a tool for improving  flight safety. Risk increases when the pilot believes the gadgets  compensate for lack of skill and knowledge. It is especially  important to recognize there are limits to what the electronic  systems in any light GA aircraft can do. Being PIC requires  sound ADM, which sometimes means saying “no” to a flight.  

Risk is also increased when the pilot fails to monitor the  systems. By failing to monitor the systems and failing to  check the results of the processes, the pilot becomes detached  from the aircraft operation and slides into the complacent role  of passenger in command. Complacency led to tragedy in a  1999 aircraft accident.  

In Colombia, a multi-engine aircraft crewed with two pilots  struck the face of the Andes Mountains. Examination of  their FMS revealed they entered a waypoint into the FMS  incorrectly by one degree resulting in a flight path taking  them to a point  $60\;\mathrm{{NM}}$   off their intended course. The pilots  were equipped with the proper charts, their route was posted  on the charts, and they had a paper navigation log indicating  the direction of each leg. They had all the tools to manage  and monitor their flight, but instead allowed the automation  to fly and manage itself. The system did exactly what it was  programmed to do; it flew on a programmed course into a  mountain resulting in multiple deaths. The pilots simply failed  to manage the system and inherently created their own hazard.  Although this hazard was self-induced, what is notable is the  risk the pilots created through their own inattention. By failing  to evaluate each turn made at the direction of automation, the  pilots maximized risk instead of minimizing it. In this case, a  totally avoidable accident become a tragedy through simple  pilot error and complacency.  

For the GA pilot transitioning to automated systems, it is  helpful to note that all human activity involving technical  devices entails some element of risk. Knowledge, experience,  and mission requirements tilt the odds in favor of safe and  successful flights. The advanced avionics aircraft offers  many new capabilities and simplifies the basic flying tasks,  but only if the pilot is properly trained and all the equipment  is working as advertised.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter focused on helping the pilot improve his or  her ADM skills with the goal of mitigating the risk factors  associated with flight in both classic and automated aircraft.  In the end, the discussion is not so much about aircraft, but  about the people who fly them.  

# Chapter 3 Aircraft  Construction  

# Introduction  

An aircraft is a device that is used, or intended to be used, for  flight according to the current Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 1, Definitions and Abbreviations.  Categories of aircraft for certification of airmen include  airplane, rotorcraft, glider, lighter-than-air, powered-lift,  powered parachute, and weight-shift control aircraft. Title  14 CFR part 1 also defines airplane as an engine-driven,  fixed-wing aircraft that is supported in flight by the dynamic  reaction of air against its wings. Another term, not yet  codified in 14 CFR part 1, is advanced avionics aircraft,  which refers to an aircraft that contains a global positioning  system (GPS) navigation system with a moving map display,  in conjunction with another system, such as an autopilot.  This chapter provides a brief introduction to the structure  of aircraft and uses an airplane for most illustrations. Light  Sport Aircraft (LSA), such as weight-shift control aircraft,  balloon, glider, powered parachute, and gyroplane, have their  own handbooks to include detailed information regarding  aerodynamics and control.  

#  

# Aircraft Design, Certification, and  Airworthiness  

The FAA certifies three types of aviation products: aircraft,  aircraft engines, and propellers. Each of these products  has been designed to a set of airworthiness standards.  These standards are parts of Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR), published by the FAA. The  airworthiness standards were developed to help ensure that  aviation products are designed with no unsafe features.  Different airworthiness standards apply to the different  categories of aviation products as follows:  

• 	 Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, and Commuter Category  Airplanes- 14 CFR part 23 • 	 Transport Category Airplanes—14 CFR part 25 • 	 Normal Category—14 CFR part 27 • 	 Transport Category Rotorcraft—14 CFR part 29 • 	 Manned Free Balloons—14 CFR part 31 • 	 Aircraft Engines—14 CFR part 33 • 	 Propellers—14 CFR part 35  

Some aircraft are considered “special classes” of aircraft and  do not have their own airworthiness standards, such as gliders  and powered lift. The airworthiness standards used for these  aircraft are a combination of requirements in 14 CFR parts  23, 25, 27, and 29 that the FAA and the designer have agreed  are appropriate for the proposed aircraft.  

The FAA issues a Type Certificate (TC) for the product  when they are satisfied it complies with the applicable  airworthiness standards. When the TC is issued, a Type  Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) is generated that specifies  the important design and operational characteristics of the  aircraft, aircraft engine, or propeller. The TCDS defines the  product and are available to the public from the FAA website  at www.faa.gov.  

# A Note About Light Sport Aircraft  

Light sport aircraft are not designed according to FAA  airworthiness standards. Instead, they are designed to a  consensus of standards agreed upon in the aviation industry.  The FAA has agreed the consensus of standards is acceptable  as the design criteria for these aircraft. Light sport aircraft do  not necessarily have individually type certificated engines  and propellers. Instead, a TC is issued to the aircraft as a  whole. It includes the airframe, engine, and propeller.  

Aircraft, aircraft engines, and propellers can be manufactured  one at a time from the design drawings, or through an FAA  approved manufacturing process, depending on the size and  capabilities of the manufacturer. During the manufacturing  process, each part is inspected to ensure that it has been built  exactly according to the approved design. This inspection is  called a conformity inspection.  

When the aircraft is complete, with the airframe, engine, and  propeller, it is inspected and the FAA issues an airworthiness  certificate for the aircraft. Having an airworthiness  certificate means the complete aircraft meets the design and  manufacturing standards, and is in a condition for safe flight.  This airworthiness certificate must be carried in the aircraft  during all flight operations. The airworthiness certificate  remains valid as long as the required maintenance and  inspections are kept up to date for the aircraft.  

Airworthiness certificates are classified as either “Standard”  or “Special.” Standard airworthiness certificates are white,  and are issued for normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter, or  transport category aircraft. They are also issued for manned  free balloons and aircraft designated as “Special Class.”  

Special airworthiness certificates are pink, and are issued  for primary, restricted, and limited category aircraft, and  light sport aircraft. They are also issued as provisional  airworthiness certificates, special flight permits (ferry  permits), and for experimental aircraft.  

More information on airworthiness certificates can be found  in Chapter 9, in 14 CFR parts 175-225, and also on the FAA  website at www.faa.gov.  

# Lift and Basic Aerodynamics  

In order to understand the operation of the major components  and subcomponents of an aircraft, it is important to  understand basic aerodynamic concepts. This chapter briefly  introduces aerodynamics; a more detailed explanation can be  found in Chapter 5, Aerodynamics of Flight.  

Four forces act upon an aircraft in relation to straight-and- level, unaccelerated flight. These forces are thrust, lift,  weight, and drag.  [Figure 3-1]  

Thrust is the forward force produced by the powerplant/ propeller. It opposes or overcomes the force of drag. As a  general rule, it is said to act parallel to the longitudinal axis.  This is not always the case as explained later.  

Drag is a rearward, retarding force and is caused by disruption  of airflow by the wing, fuselage, and other protruding objects.  Drag opposes thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative  wind.

Figure 3-1.   The four forces.  

Weight is the combined load of the aircraft itself, the crew,  the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls the aircraft  downward because of the force of gravity. It opposes lift  and acts vertically downward through the aircraft’s center  of gravity (CG).  

Lift opposes the downward force of weight, is produced by  the dynamic effect of the air acting on the wing, and acts  perpendicular to the flight path through the wing’s center  of lift (CL).  

An aircraft moves in three dimensions and is controlled by  moving it about one or more of its axes. The longitudinal,  or roll, axis extends through the aircraft from nose to tail,  with the line passing through the CG. The lateral or pitch  axis extends across the aircraft on a line through the wing  tips, again passing through the CG. The vertical, or yaw, axis  passes through the aircraft vertically, intersecting the CG. All  control movements cause the aircraft to move around one or  more of these axes and allows for the control of the aircraft  in flight.  [Figure 3-2]  

One of the most significant components of aircraft design is  CG. It is the specific point where the mass or weight of an  aircraft may be said to center; that is, a point around which,  if the aircraft could be suspended or balanced, the aircraft  would remain relatively level. The position of the CG of  an aircraft determines the stability of the aircraft in flight.  As the CG moves rearward (towards the tail), the aircraft  becomes more and more dynamically unstable. In aircraft  with fuel tanks situated in front of the CG, it is important  that the CG is set with the fuel tank empty. Otherwise, as the  fuel is used, the aircraft becomes unstable.  [Figure 3-3]  The  CG is computed during initial design and construction and  is further affected by the installation of onboard equipment,  aircraft loading, and other factors.  

# Major Components  

Although airplanes are designed for a variety of purposes, most  of them have the same major components.  [Figure 3-4]  The  overall characteristics are largely determined by the original  design objectives. Most airplane structures include a fuselage,  wings, an empennage, landing gear, and a powerplant.  

# Fuselage  

The fuselage is the central body of an airplane and is designed  to accommodate the crew, passengers, and cargo. It also  provides the structural connection for the wings and tail  assembly. Older types of aircraft design utilized an open truss  structure constructed of wood, steel, or aluminum tubing.  [Figure 3-5]  The most popular types of fuselage structures  used in today’s aircraft are the monocoque (French for  “single shell”) and semimonocoque. These structure types  are discussed in more detail under aircraft construction later  in the chapter.  

# Wings  

The wings are airfoils attached to each side of the fuselage  and are the main lifting surfaces that support the airplane in

If the CG is too far aft, there might not be enough elevator nose-down  force at the low stall airspeed to get the nose down for recovery.

flight. There are numerous wing designs, sizes, and shapes  used by the various manufacturers. Each fulfills a certain need  with respect to the expected performance for the particular  airplane. How the wing produces lift is explained in Chapter  5, Aerodynamics of Flight.  

Wings may be attached at the top, middle, or lower portion  of the fuselage. These designs are referred to as high-, mid-,  and low-wing, respectively. The number of wings can also  vary. Airplanes with a single set of wings are referred to as  monoplanes, while those with two sets are called biplanes.  [Figure 3-6]  

Many high-wing airplanes have external braces, or wing  struts that transmit the flight and landing loads through the  struts to the main fuselage structure. Since the wing struts  are usually attached approximately halfway out on the wing,  this type of wing structure is called semi-cantilever. A few  high-wing and most low-wing airplanes have a full cantilever  wing designed to carry the loads without external struts.  

The principal structural parts of the wing are spars, ribs,  and stringers.  [Figure 3-7]  These are reinforced by trusses,  I-beams, tubing, or other devices, including the skin. The  wing ribs determine the shape and thickness of the wing  (airfoil). In most modern airplanes, the fuel tanks are either  an integral part of the wing’s structure or consist of flexible  containers mounted inside of the wing.  

![](images/5c45c6aeb3d3f4218fcf0b4f84524a0daf2cafd6b497a25a47be1ae5142be5e7.jpg)  
Figure 3-6.   Monoplane (left) and biplane (right).  

Attached to the rear, or trailing edges, of the wings are two  types of control surfaces referred to as ailerons and flaps.  Ailerons extend from about the midpoint of each wing  outward toward the tip, and move in opposite directions to  create aerodynamic forces that cause the airplane to roll.  Flaps extend outward from the fuselage to near the midpoint  of each wing. The flaps are normally flush with the wing’s  surface during cruising flight. When extended, the flaps move  simultaneously downward to increase the lifting force of the  wing for takeoffs and landings.  [Figure 3-8]  

# Alternate Types of Wings  

Alternate types of wings are often found on aircraft. The  shape and design of a wing is dependent upon the type of  operation for which an aircraft is intended and is tailored  to specific types of flying. These design variations are  discussed in Chapter 5, Aerodynamics of Flight, which  provides information on the effect controls have on lifting  surfaces from traditional wings to wings that use both flexing  (due to billowing) and shifting (through the change of the  aircraft’s CG). For example, the wing of the weight-shift  control aircraft is highly swept in an effort to reduce drag  and allow for the shifting of weight to provide controlled  flight.  [Figure 3-9]  Handbooks specific to most categories  of aircraft are available for the interested pilot and can be  found on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website  at www.faa.gov.

# Empennage  

The empennage includes the entire tail group and consists  of fixed surfaces, such as the vertical stabilizer and the  horizontal stabilizer. The movable surfaces include the  rudder, the elevator, and one or more trim tabs.  [Figure 3-10]  

The rudder is attached to the back of the vertical stabilizer.  During flight, it is used to move the airplane’s nose left  and right. The elevator, which is attached to the back of the  horizontal stabilizer, is used to move the nose of the airplane  up and down during flight. Trim tabs are small, movable  

![](images/e210197ae7e398c0cf492361c13111388161a028f6f2bbb9b41aa091af97e95e.jpg)  
Figure 3-9.   Weight-shift control aircraft use the shifting of weight  for control.  

portions of the trailing edge of the control surface. These  movable trim tabs, which are controlled from the flight deck,  reduce control pressures. Trim tabs may be installed on the  ailerons, the rudder, and/or the elevator.  

A second type of empennage design does not require an  elevator. Instead, it incorporates a one-piece horizontal  stabilizer that pivots from a central hinge point. This type of  design is called a stabilator and is moved using the control  wheel, just as the elevator is moved. For example, when a  pilot pulls back on the control wheel, the stabilator pivots so  the trailing edge moves up. This increases the aerodynamic  tail load and causes the nose of the airplane to move up.  Stabilators have an antiservo tab extending across their  trailing edge.  [Figure 3-11]  

The antiservo tab moves in the same direction as the trailing  edge of the stabilator and helps make the stabilator less  sensitive. The antiservo tab also functions as a trim tab to  relieve control pressures and helps maintain the stabilator in  the desired position.

# Landing Gear  

The landing gear is the principal support of the airplane when  parked, taxiing, taking off, or landing. The most common type  of landing gear consists of wheels, but airplanes can also be  equipped with floats for water operations or skis for landing  on snow.  [Figure 3-12]  

Wheeled landing gear consists of three wheels—two main  wheels and a third wheel positioned either at the front or rear  of the airplane. Landing gear with a rear mounted wheel is  called conventional landing gear.  

Airplanes with conventional landing gear are sometimes  referred to as tailwheel airplanes. When the third wheel is  located on the nose, it is called a nosewheel, and the design  is referred to as a tricycle gear. A steerable nosewheel or  tailwheel permits the airplane to be controlled throughout all  operations while on the ground. Most aircraft are steered by  moving the rudder pedals, whether nosewheel or tailwheel.  Additionally, some aircraft are steered by differential braking.  

# The Powerplant  

The powerplant usually includes both the engine and the  propeller. The primary function of the engine is to provide  the power to turn the propeller. It also generates electrical  power, provides a vacuum source for some flight instruments,  and in most single-engine airplanes, provides a source of  heat for the pilot and passengers.  [Figure 3-13]  The engine  is covered by a cowling, or a nacelle, which are both types  of covered housing. The purpose of the cowling or nacelle  is to streamline the flow of air around the engine and to help  cool the engine by ducting air around the cylinders.  

The propeller, mounted on the front of the engine, translates  the rotating force of the engine into thrust, a forward acting  force that helps move the airplane through the air. A propeller  

![](images/a767bf23cc3dbe2d92488f840a4b3a7bc74faa68e1124800a1d1eefc187b36f7.jpg)  
Figure 3-12.   Types of landing gear: floats (top), skis (middle), and  wheels (bottom).  

is a rotating airfoil that produces thrust through aerodynamic  action. A high-pressure area is formed at the back of the  propeller’s airfoil, and low pressure is produced at the face of  the propeller, similar to the way lift is generated by an airfoil  used as a lifting surface or wing. This pressure differential  develops thrust from the propeller, which in turn pulls the  airplane forward. Engines may be turned around to be pushers  with the propeller at the rear.  

There are two significant factors involved in the design  of a propeller that impact its effectiveness. The angle of a

Figure 3-13.  Engine compartment.  

propeller blade, as measured against the hub of the propeller,  keeps the angle of attack (AOA) (See definition in Glossary)  relatively constant along the span of the propeller blade,  reducing or eliminating the possibility of a stall. The amount  of lift being produced by the propeller is directly related to  the AOA, which is the angle at which the relative wind meets  the blade. The AOA continuously changes during the flight  depending upon the direction of the aircraft.  

The pitch is defined as the distance a propeller would travel in  one revolution if it were turning in a solid. These two factors  combine to allow a measurement of the propeller’s efficiency.  Propellers are usually matched to a specific aircraft/ powerplant combination to achieve the best efficiency at a  particular power setting, and they pull or push depending on  how the engine is mounted.  

# Subcomponents  

The subcomponents of an airplane include the airframe,  electrical system, flight controls, and brakes.  

The airframe is the basic structure of an aircraft and is  designed to withstand all aerodynamic forces, as well as the  stresses imposed by the weight of the fuel, crew, and payload.  

The primary function of an aircraft electrical system is to  generate, regulate, and distribute electrical power throughout  the aircraft. There are several different power sources on  aircraft to power the aircraft electrical systems. These  power sources include: engine-driven alternating current  (AC) generators, auxiliary power units (APUs), and external  power. The aircraft’s electrical power system is used to  operate the flight instruments, essential systems, such as  anti-icing, and passenger services, such as cabin lighting.  

The flight controls are the devices and systems that govern  the attitude of an aircraft and, as a result, the flight path  followed by the aircraft. In the case of many conventional  airplanes, the primary flight controls utilize hinged, trailing- edge surfaces called elevators for pitch, ailerons for roll, and  the rudder for yaw. These surfaces are operated by the pilot  in the flight deck or by an automatic pilot.  

In the case of most modern airplanes, airplane brakes consist  of multiple pads (called caliper pads) that are hydraulically  squeezed toward each other with a rotating disk (called a  rotor) between them. The pads place pressure on the rotor  which is turning with the wheels. As a result of the increased  friction on the rotor, the wheels inherently slow down and  stop turning. The disks and brake pads are made either from  steel, like those in a car, or from a carbon material that weighs  less and can absorb more energy. Because airplane brakes are  used principally during landings and must absorb enormous  amounts of energy, their life is measured in landings rather  than miles.  

# Types of Aircraft Construction  

The construction of aircraft fuselages evolved from the early  wood truss structural arrangements to monocoque shell  structures to the current semimonocoque shell structures.  

# Truss Structure  

The main drawback of truss structure is its lack of a  streamlined shape. In this construction method, lengths of  tubing, called longerons, are welded in place to form a well- braced framework. Vertical and horizontal struts are welded  to the longerons and give the structure a square or rectangular  shape when viewed from the end. Additional struts are needed  to resist stress that can come from any direction. Stringers  and bulkheads, or formers, are added to shape the fuselage  and support the covering.  

As technology progressed, aircraft designers began to enclose  the truss members to streamline the airplane and improve  performance. This was originally accomplished with cloth  fabric, which eventually gave way to lightweight metals such  as aluminum. In some cases, the outside skin can support all  or a major portion of the flight loads. Most modern aircraft  use a form of this stressed skin structure known as monocoque  or semimonocoque construction.  [Figure 3-14]  

# Monocoque  

Monocoque construction uses stressed skin to support almost  all loads much like an aluminum beverage can. Although  very strong, monocoque construction is not highly tolerant  

![](images/43e076d74a65be1dd4e569e668c84c86eca0370e4975da440a7e5a76b7bee7f7.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.  Semimonocoque and monocoque fuselage design.  

to deformation of the surface. For example, an aluminum  beverage can supports considerable forces at the ends of  the can, but if the side of the can is deformed slightly while  supporting a load, it collapses easily.  

Because most twisting and bending stresses are carried by  the external skin rather than by an open framework, the need  for internal bracing was eliminated or reduced, saving weight  and maximizing space. One of the notable and innovative  methods for using monocoque construction was employed by  Jack Northrop. In 1918, he devised a new way to construct  a monocoque fuselage used for the Lockheed S-1 Racer.  The technique utilized two molded plywood half-shells that  were glued together around wooden hoops or stringers. To  construct the half shells, rather than gluing many strips of  plywood over a form, three large sets of spruce strips were  soaked with glue and laid in a semi-circular concrete mold  that looked like a bathtub. Then, under a tightly clamped  lid, a rubber balloon was inflated in the cavity to press  the plywood against the mold. Twenty-four hours later,  the smooth half-shell was ready to be joined to another to  create the fuselage. The two halves were each less than a  quarter inch thick. Although employed in the early aviation  period, monocoque construction would not reemerge for  several decades due to the complexities involved. Every  day examples of monocoque construction can be found in  automobile manufacturing where the unibody is considered  standard in manufacturing.  

# Semimonocoque  

Semimonocoque construction, partial or one-half, uses a  substructure to which the airplane’s skin is attached. The  substructure, which consists of bulkheads and/or formers  of various sizes and stringers, reinforces the stressed skin  by taking some of the bending stress from the fuselage. The  main section of the fuselage also includes wing attachment  points and a firewall. On single-engine airplanes, the engine  is usually attached to the front of the fuselage. There is a  fireproof partition between the rear of the engine and the  flight deck or cabin to protect the pilot and passengers from  accidental engine fires. This partition is called a firewall and  is usually made of heat-resistant material such as stainless  steel. However, a new emerging process of construction is  the integration of composites or aircraft made entirely of  composites.  

# Composite Construction History  

The use of composites in aircraft construction can be dated  to World War II aircraft when soft fiberglass insulation was  used in B-29 fuselages. By the late 1950s, European high  performance sailplane manufacturers were using fiberglass  as primary structures. In 1965, the FAA type certified the  first all-fiberglass aircraft in the normal category, a Swiss  sailplane called a Diamant HBV. Four years later, the FAA  certified a four-seat, single-engine Windecker Eagle in the  normal category. By 2005, over 35 percent of new aircraft  were constructed of composite materials.  

Composite is a broad term and can mean materials such as  fiberglass, carbon fiber cloth, Kevlar™ cloth, and mixtures  of all of the above. Composite construction offers two  advantages: extremely smooth skins and the ability to easily  form complex curved or streamlined structures.  [Figure 3-15]  

# Composite Materials in Aircraft  

Composite materials are fiber-reinforced matrix systems.  The matrix is the “glue” used to hold the fibers together  and, when cured, gives the part its shape, but the fibers carry  most of the load. There are many different types of fibers  and matrix systems.  

In aircraft, the most common matrix is epoxy resin, which is  a type of thermosetting plastic. Compared to other choices  such as polyester resin, epoxy is stronger and has good high- temperature properties. There are many different types of  epoxies available with a wide range of structural properties,  cure times and temperatures, and costs.  

![](images/8ebc23a944e59568b600cd4bb71ce58363d7059e4e130a3b6e6410fb394866ab.jpg)  
Figure 3-15.  Composite aircraft.  

The most common reinforcing fibers used in aircraft  construction are fiberglass and carbon fiber. Fiberglass  has good tensile and compressive strength, good impact  resistance, is easy to work with, and is relatively inexpensive  and readily available. Its main disadvantage is that it is  somewhat heavy, and it is difficult to make a fiberglass load- carrying structure lighter than a well designed equivalent  aluminum structure.  

Carbon fiber is generally stronger in tensile and compressive  strength than fiberglass and has much higher bending  stiffness. It is also considerably lighter than fiberglass.  However, it is relatively poor in impact resistance; the fibers  are brittle and tend to shatter under sharp impact. This can  be greatly improved with a “toughened” epoxy resin system,  as used in the Boeing 787 horizontal and vertical stabilizers.  Carbon fiber is more expensive than fiberglass, but the price  has dropped due to innovations driven by the B-2 program  in the 1980s and Boeing 777 work in the 1990s. Very well- designed carbon fiber structures can be significantly lighter  than an equivalent aluminum structure, sometimes by 30  percent or so.  

# Advantages of Composites  

Composite construction offers several advantages over  metal, wood, or fabric, with its lighter weight being the most  frequently cited. Lighter weight is not always automatic. It  must be remembered that building an aircraft structure out of  composites does not guarantee it will be lighter; it depends  on the structure, as well as the type of composite being used.  

A more important advantage is that a very smooth, compound  curved, aerodynamic structure made from composites  reduces drag. This is the main reason sailplane designers  switched from metal and wood to composites in the 1960s.  In aircraft, the use of composites reduces drag for the Cirrus  and Columbia line of production aircraft, leading to their high  performance despite their fixed landing gear. Composites also  help mask the radar signature of “stealth” aircraft designs,  such as the B-2 and the F-22. Today, composites can be  found in aircraft as varied as gliders to most new helicopters.  

Lack of corrosion is a third advantage of composites. Boeing  is designing the 787, with its all-composite fuselage, to have  both a higher pressure differential and higher humidity in  the cabin than previous airliners. Engineers are no longer as  concerned about corrosion from moisture condensation on the  hidden areas of the fuselage skins, such as behind insulation  blankets. This should lead to lower long-term maintenance  costs for the airlines.  

Another advantage of composites is their good performance  in a flexing environment, such as in helicopter rotor blades.  Composites do not suffer from metal fatigue and crack growth  as do metals. While it takes careful engineering, composite  rotor blades can have considerably higher design lives than  metal blades, and most new large helicopter designs have all  composite blades, and in many cases, composite rotor hubs.  

# Disadvantages of Composites  

Composite construction comes with its own set of  disadvantages, the most important of which is the lack of  visual proof of damage. Composites respond differently from  other structural materials to impact, and there is often no  obvious sign of damage. For example, if a car backs into an  aluminum fuselage, it might dent the fuselage. If the fuselage  is not dented, there is no damage. If the fuselage is dented,  the damage is visible and repairs are made.  

In a composite structure, a low energy impact, such as a  bump or a tool drop, may not leave any visible sign of the  impact on the surface. Underneath the impact site there may  be extensive delaminations, spreading in a cone-shaped area  from the impact location. The damage on the backside of  the structure can be significant and extensive, but it may be  hidden from view. Anytime one has reason to think there  may have been an impact, even a minor one, it is best to  get an inspector familiar with composites to examine the  structure to determine underlying damage. The appearance  of “whitish” areas in a fiberglass structure is a good tip-off  that delaminations of fiber fracture has occurred.  

A medium energy impact (perhaps the car backing into the  structure) results in local crushing of the surface, which  should be visible to the eye. The damaged area is larger than  the visible crushed area and will need to be repaired. A high  energy impact, such as a bird strike or hail while in flight,  results in a puncture and a severely damaged structure. In  medium and high energy impacts, the damage is visible to the  eye, but low energy impact is difficult to detect.  [Figure 3-16]  

If an impact results in delaminations, crushing of the surface,  or a puncture, then a repair is mandatory. While waiting  for the repair, the damaged area should be covered and  protected from rain. Many composite parts are composed  of thin skins over a honeycomb core, creating a “sandwich”  structure. While excellent for structural stiffness reasons,  such a structure is an easy target for water ingress (entering),  leading to further problems later. A piece of “speed tape”  over the puncture is a good way to protect it from water, but  it is not a structural repair. The use of a paste filler to cover  up the damage, while acceptable for cosmetic purposes, is  not a structural repair, either.  

![](images/2c6e7bab43b114439713e0db4cd0a21eff74120d55b8696a377832f61e51ec0f.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.  Impact energy affects the visibility, as well as the  severity, of damage in composite structures. High and medium  energy impacts, while severe, are easy to detect. Low energy impacts  can easily cause hidden damage.  

The potential for heat damage to the resin is another  disadvantage of using composites. While “too hot” depends  on the particular resin system chosen, many epoxies begin  to weaken over   $150~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  . White paint on composites is often  used to minimize this issue. For example, the bottom of  a wing that is painted black facing a black asphalt ramp  on a hot, sunny day can get as hot as   $220\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . The same  structure, painted white, rarely exceeds  $140~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  . As a result,  composite aircraft often have specific recommendations  on allowable paint colors. If the aircraft is repainted, these  recommendations must be followed. Heat damage can also  occur due to a fire. Even a quickly extinguished small brake  fire can damage bottom wing skins, composite landing gear  legs, or wheel pants.  

Also, chemical paint strippers are very harmful to composites  and must not be used on them. If paint needs to be removed  from composites, only mechanical methods are allowed, such  as gentle grit blasting or sanding. Many expensive composite  parts have been ruined by the use of paint stripper and such  damage is generally not repairable.  

# Fluid Spills on Composites  

Some owners are concerned about fuel, oil, or hydraulic fluid  spills on composite surfaces. These are generally not a problem  with modern composites using epoxy resin. Usually, if the  spill does not attack the paint, it will not hurt the underlying  composite. Some aircraft use fiberglass fuel tanks, for example,  in which the fuel rides directly against the composite surface  with no sealant being used. If the fiberglass structure is made  with some of the more inexpensive types of polyester resin,  there can be a problem when using auto gas with ethanol  blended into the mixture. The more expensive types of  polyester resin, as well as epoxy resin, can be used with auto  gas, as well as 100 octane aviation gas (avgas) and jet fuel.  

# Lightning Strike Protection  

Lightning strike protection is an important consideration in  aircraft design. When an aircraft is hit by lightning, a very  large amount of energy is delivered to the structure. Whether  flying a light general aviation (GA) aircraft or a large airliner,  the basic principle of lightning strike protection is the same.  For any size aircraft, the energy from the strike must be spread  over a large surface area to lower the amps per square inch  to a harmless level.  

If lightning strikes an aluminum airplane, the electrical  energy naturally conducts easily through the aluminum  structure. The challenge is to keep the energy out of avionics,  fuel systems, etc., until it can be safely conducted overboard.  The outer skin of the aircraft is the path of least resistance.  

In a composite aircraft, fiberglass is an excellent electrical  insulator, while carbon fiber conducts electricity, but not  as easily as aluminum. Therefore, additional electrical  conductivity needs to be added to the outside layer of  composite skin. This is done typically with fine metal meshes  bonded to the skin surfaces. Aluminum and copper mesh  are the two most common types, with aluminum used on  fiberglass and copper on carbon fiber. Any structural repairs  on lightning-strike protected areas must also include the mesh  as well as the underlying structure.  

For composite aircraft with internal radio antennas, there  must be “windows” in the lightning strike mesh in the area  of the antenna. Internal radio antennas may be found in  fiberglass composites because fiberglass is transparent to  radio frequencies, where carbon fiber is not.  

# The Future of Composites  

In the decades since World War II, composites have earned  an important role in aircraft structure design. Their design  flexibility and corrosion resistance, as well as the high  strength-to-weight ratios possible, will undoubtedly continue  to lead to more innovative aircraft designs in the future.  From the Cirrus SR-20 to the Boeing 787, it is obvious that  composites have found a home in aircraft construction and  are here to stay.  [Figure 3-17]  

# Instrumentation: Moving into the Future  

Until recently, most GA aircraft were equipped with  individual instruments utilized collectively to safely operate  and maneuver the aircraft. With the release of the electronic  flight display (EFD) system, conventional instruments have  been replaced by multiple liquid crystal display (LCD)  screens. The first screen is installed in front of the pilot  position and is referred to as the primary flight display (PFD).  The second screen, positioned approximately in the center  of the instrument panel, is referred to as the multi-function  display (MFD). These two screens de-clutter instrument  panels while increasing safety. This has been accomplished  through the utilization of solid state instruments that have  a failure rate far less than those of conventional analog  instrumentation.  [Figure 3-18]  

With today’s improvements in avionics and the introduction  of EFDs, pilots at any level of experience need an astute  knowledge of the onboard flight control systems, as well as  an understanding of how automation melds with aeronautical  decision-making (ADM). These subjects are covered in detail  in Chapter 2, Aeronautical Decision-Making.  

Whether an aircraft has analog or digital (glass) instruments,  the instrumentation falls into three different categories:  performance, control, and navigation.

# Performance Instruments  

The performance instruments indicate the aircraft’s actual  performance. Performance is determined by reference to the  altimeter, airspeed or vertical speed indicator (VSI), heading  indicator, and turn-and-slip indicator. The performance  instruments directly reflect the performance the aircraft  is achieving. The speed of the aircraft can be referenced  on the airspeed indicator. The altitude can be referenced  on the altimeter. The aircraft’s climb performance can be  determined by referencing the VSI. Other performance  instruments available are the heading indicator, angle of  attack indicator, and the slip-skid indicator.  [Figure 3-19]

# Control Instruments  

The control instruments display immediate attitude and power  changes and are calibrated to permit adjustments in precise  increments.  [Figure 3-20]  The instrument for attitude display  is the attitude indicator. The control instruments do not  indicate aircraft speed or altitude. In order to determine these  variables and others, a pilot must reference the performance  instruments.  

selected navigation facility or fix. They also provide pilotage  information so the aircraft can be maneuvered to keep it on  a predetermined path. The pilotage information can be in  either two or three dimensions relative to the ground-based or  space-based navigation information.  [Figures 3-21  and  3-22]  

# Global Positioning System (GPS)  

GPS is a satellite-based navigation system composed of a  network of satellites placed into orbit by the United States  Department of Defense (DOD). GPS was originally intended  for military applications, but in the 1980s the government  made the system available for civilian use. GPS works in  all weather conditions, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a  day. A GPS receiver must be locked onto the signal of at  least three satellites to calculate a two-dimensional position  (latitude and longitude) and track movement. With four or  more satellites in view, the receiver can determine the user’s  three-dimensional position (latitude, longitude, and altitude).  Other satellites must also be in view to offset signal loss  and signal ambiguity. The use of the GPS is discussed in  more detail in Chapter 1 6 , Navigation. Additionally, GPS is  discussed in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provides an overview of aircraft structures.  A more in-depth understanding of aircraft structures and  controls can be gained through the use of flight simulation  software or interactive programs available online through  aviation organizations, such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots  Association (AOPA). Pilots are also encouraged to subscribe  to or review the various aviation periodicals that contain  valuable flying information. As discussed in Chapter 1, the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and  the FAA also offer free information for pilots.  

# Navigation Instruments  

The navigation instruments indicate the position of the  aircraft in relation to a selected navigation facility or fix.  This group of instruments includes various types of course  indicators, range indicators, glideslope indicators, and  bearing pointers. Newer aircraft with more technologically  advanced instrumentation provide blended information,  giving the pilot more accurate positional information.  

Navigation instruments are comprised of indicators that  display GPS, very high frequency (VHF) omni-directional  radio range (VOR), nondirectional beacon (NDB),  and instrument landing system (ILS) information. The  instruments indicate the position of the aircraft relative to a

# Chapter 4 Principles of  Flight  

# Introduction  

This chapter examines the fundamental physical laws  governing the forces acting on an aircraft in flight, and  what effect these natural laws and forces have on the  performance characteristics of aircraft. To control an aircraft,  be it an airplane, helicopter, glider, or balloon, the pilot  must understand the principles involved and learn to use or  counteract these natural forces.  

# Structure of the Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is an envelope of air that surrounds the Earth  and rests upon its surface. It is as much a part of the Earth as  the seas or the land, but air differs from land and water as it is  a mixture of gases. It has mass, weight, and indefinite shape.  

The atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21  percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as argon  or helium. Some of these elements are heavier than others.  The heavier elements, such as oxygen, settle to the surface  of the Earth, while the lighter elements are lifted up to the  region of higher altitude. Most of the atmosphere’s oxygen  is contained below 35,000 feet altitude.  

# Air is a Fluid  

When most people hear the word “fluid,” they usually think  of liquid. However, gasses, like air, are also fluids. Fluids  take on the shape of their containers. Fluids generally do not  resist deformation when even the smallest stress is applied,  or they resist it only slightly. We call this slight resistance  viscosity. Fluids also have the ability to flow. Just as a liquid  flows and fills a container, air will expand to fill the available  volume of its container. Both liquids and gasses display these  unique fluid properties, even though they differ greatly in  density. Understanding the fluid properties of air is essential  to understanding the principles of flight.  

# Viscosity  

Viscosity is the property of a fluid that causes it to resist  flowing. The way individual molecules of the fluid tend to  adhere, or stick, to each other determines how much a fluid  resists flow. High-viscosity fluids are “thick” and resist flow;  low-viscosity fluids are “thin” and flow easily. Air has a low  viscosity and flows easily.  

Using two liquids as an example, similar amounts of oil and  water poured down two identical ramps will flow at different  rates due to their different viscosity. The water seems to flow  freely while the oil flows much more slowly.  

As another example, different types of similar liquids will  display different behaviors because of different viscosities.  Grease is very viscous. Given time, grease will flow, even  though the flow rate will be slow. Motor oil is less viscous  than grease and flows much more easily, but it is more viscous  and flows more slowly than gasoline.  

the viscosity of air. However, since air is a fluid and has  viscosity properties, it resists flow around any object to  some extent.  

# Friction  

Another factor at work when a fluid flows over or around  an object is called friction. Friction is the resistance that one  surface or object encounters when moving over another.  Friction exists between any two materials that contact each  other.  

The effects of friction can be demonstrated using a similar  example as before. If identical fluids are poured down two  identical ramps, they flow in the same manner and at the  same speed. If the surface of one ramp is rough, and the other  smooth, the flow down the two ramps differs significantly.  The rough surface ramp impedes the flow of the fluid due  to resistance from the surface (friction). It is important to  remember that all surfaces, no matter how smooth they  appear, are not smooth on a microscopic level and impede  the flow of a fluid.  

The surface of a wing, like any other surface, has a certain  roughness at the microscopic level. The surface roughness  causes resistance and slows the velocity of the air flowing  over the wing.  [Figure 4-1]  

Molecules of air pass over the surface of the wing and actually  adhere (stick, or cling) to the surface because of friction. Air  molecules near the surface of the wing resist motion and have  a relative velocity near zero. The roughness of the surface  impedes their motion. The layer of molecules that adhere to  the wing surface is referred to as the boundary layer.  

All fluids are viscous and have a resistance to flow, whether  or not we observe this resistance. We cannot easily observe  

![](images/94b49ccf9c8ead5001ef82d088f72a436cdb70e51fb44e0205e5c6226530580e.jpg)  
Figure 4-1.  Microscopic surface of a wing.  

Once the boundary layer of the air adheres to the wing by  friction, further resistance to the airflow is caused by the  viscosity, the tendency of the air to stick to itself. When  these two forces act together to resist airflow over a wing,  it is called drag.  

# Pressure  

Pressure is the force applied in a perpendicular direction to the  surface of an object. Often, pressure is measured in pounds of  force exerted per square inch of an object, or PSI. An object  completely immersed in a fluid will feel pressure uniformly  around the entire surface of the object. If the pressure on one  surface of the object becomes less than the pressure exerted  on the other surfaces, the object will move in the direction  of the lower pressure.  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

Although there are various kinds of pressure, pilots are  mainly concerned with atmospheric pressure. It is one of  the basic factors in weather changes, helps to lift an aircraft,  and actuates some of the important flight instruments. These  instruments are the altimeter, airspeed indicator, vertical  speed indicator, and manifold pressure gauge.  

Air is very light, but it has mass and is affected by the  attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other substance,  it has weight, and because of its weight, it has force. Since  air is a fluid substance, this force is exerted equally in all  directions. Its effect on bodies within the air is called pressure.  Under standard conditions at sea level, the average pressure  exerted by the weight of the atmosphere is approximately  14.70 pounds per square inch (psi) of surface, or 1,013.2  millibars (mb). The thickness of the atmosphere is limited;  therefore, the higher the altitude, the less air there is above.  For this reason, the weight of the atmosphere at 18,000 feet  is one-half what it is at sea level.  

The pressure of the atmosphere varies with time and location.  Due to the changing atmospheric pressure, a standard  reference was developed. The standard atmosphere at sea  level is a surface temperature of  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and a surface  pressure of 29.92 inches of mercury   $({}^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   or   $1{,}013{.}2~\mathrm{mb}$  .  [Figure 4-2]  

A standard temperature lapse rate is when the temperature  decreases at the rate of approximately   $3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or   $2\,^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   per  thousand feet up to 36,000 feet, which is approximately  $-65$     $^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or  $-55\,^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  . Above this point, the temperature is considered  constant up to 80,000 feet. A standard pressure lapse rate is  when pressure decreases at a rate of approximately   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$    per 1,000 feet of altitude gain to 10,000 feet.  [Figure 4-3]   The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has  established this as a worldwide standard, and it is often  

![](images/a7e5a68227d7c8e34efab344448838b2cd0f903a52a654e12cb120b5eb789e54.jpg)

![Figure 4-3.  Properties of standard atmosphere. ](images/65912a6c11db072dec9a88eed0281d50004d338cd10bf1445beb2d0ac195f14b.jpg)  

referred to as International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) or  ICAO Standard Atmosphere. Any temperature or pressure  that differs from the standard lapse rates is considered  nonstandard temperature and pressure.  

Since aircraft performance is compared and evaluated with  respect to the standard atmosphere, all aircraft instruments are  calibrated for the standard atmosphere. In order to properly  account for the nonstandard atmosphere, certain related terms  must be defined.  

# Pressure Altitude  

Pressure altitude is the height above a standard datum plane  (SDP), which is a theoretical level where the weight of the  atmosphere is   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   (  $^{1,013.2\mathrm{~mb}}$  ) as measured by a  barometer. An altimeter is essentially a sensitive barometer  calibrated to indicate altitude in the standard atmosphere. If  the altimeter is set for   $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg\;SDP}$  , the altitude indicated  is the pressure altitude. As atmospheric pressure changes, the  SDP may be below, at, or above sea level. Pressure altitude  is important as a basis for determining airplane performance,  as well as for assigning flight levels to airplanes operating at  or above 18,000 feet.  

The pressure altitude can be determined by one of the  following methods:  

1.	 Setting the barometric scale of the altimeter to 29.92  and reading the indicated altitude 2.	 Applying a correction factor to the indicated altitude  according to the reported altimeter setting  

# Density Altitude  

SDP is a theoretical pressure altitude, but aircraft operate in a  nonstandard atmosphere and the term density altitude is used  for correlating aerodynamic performance in the nonstandard  atmosphere. Density altitude is the vertical distance above sea  level in the standard atmosphere at which a given density is  to be found. The density of air has significant effects on the  aircraft’s performance because as air becomes less dense,  it reduces:  

• 	 Power because the engine takes in less air  • 	 Thrust because a propeller is less efficient in thin air • 	 Lift because the thin air exerts less force on the airfoils  

Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard  temperature. As the density of the air increases (lower  density altitude), aircraft performance increases; conversely  as air density decreases (higher density altitude), aircraft  performance decreases. A decrease in air density means  a high density altitude; an increase in air density means a  lower density altitude. Density altitude is used in calculating  aircraft performance because under standard atmospheric  conditions, air at each level in the atmosphere not only has  a specific density, its pressure altitude and density altitude  identify the same level.  

The computation of density altitude involves consideration  of pressure (pressure altitude) and temperature. Since aircraft  performance data at any level is based upon air density under  standard day conditions, such performance data apply to  air density levels that may not be identical with altimeter  indications. Under conditions higher or lower than standard,  these levels cannot be determined directly from the altimeter.  

Density altitude is determined by first finding pressure  altitude, and then correcting this altitude for nonstandard  temperature variations. Since density varies directly with  pressure and inversely with temperature, a given pressure  altitude may exist for a wide range of temperatures by  allowing the density to vary. However, a known density  occurs for any one temperature and pressure altitude. The  density of the air has a pronounced effect on aircraft and  engine performance. Regardless of the actual altitude of the  aircraft, it will perform as though it were operating at an  altitude equal to the existing density altitude.  

Air density is affected by changes in altitude, temperature,  and humidity. High density altitude refers to thin air, while  low density altitude refers to dense air. The conditions that  result in a high density altitude are high elevations, low  atmospheric pressures, high temperatures, high humidity, or  some combination of these factors. Lower elevations, high  atmospheric pressure, low temperatures, and low humidity  are more indicative of low density altitude.  

# Effect of Pressure on Density  

Since air is a gas, it can be compressed or expanded. When  air is compressed, a greater amount of air can occupy a given  volume. Conversely, when pressure on a given volume of air  is decreased, the air expands and occupies a greater space.  At a lower pressure, the original column of air contains a  smaller mass of air. The density is decreased because density  is directly proportional to pressure. If the pressure is doubled,  the density is doubled; if the pressure is lowered, the density is  lowered. This statement is true only at a constant temperature.  

# Effect of Temperature on Density  

Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its  density. Conversely, decreasing the temperature increases  the density. Thus, the density of air varies inversely with  temperature. This statement is true only at a constant pressure.  

In the atmosphere, both temperature and pressure decrease  with altitude and have conflicting effects upon density.  However, a fairly rapid drop in pressure as altitude increases  usually has a dominating effect. Hence, pilots can expect the  density to decrease with altitude.  

# Effect of Humidity (Moisture) on Density  

The preceding paragraphs refer to air that is perfectly dry. In  reality, it is never completely dry. The small amount of water  vapor suspended in the atmosphere may be almost negligible  under certain conditions, but in other conditions humidity  may become an important factor in the performance of an  aircraft. Water vapor is lighter than air; consequently, moist  air is lighter than dry air. Therefore, as the water content  of the air increases, the air becomes less dense, increasing  density altitude and decreasing performance. It is lightest or  least dense when, in a given set of conditions, it contains the  maximum amount of water vapor.  

Humidity, also called relative humidity, refers to the amount  of water vapor contained in the atmosphere and is expressed  as a percentage of the maximum amount of water vapor the  air can hold. This amount varies with temperature. Warm air  holds more water vapor, while cold air holds less. Perfectly  dry air that contains no water vapor has a relative humidity  of zero percent, while saturated air, which cannot hold any  more water vapor, has a relative humidity of 100 percent.  Humidity alone is usually not considered an important factor  in calculating density altitude and aircraft performance, but  it is a contributing factor.  

As temperature increases, the air can hold greater amounts  of water vapor. When comparing two separate air masses,  the first warm and moist (both qualities tending to lighten  the air) and the second cold and dry (both qualities making  it heavier), the first must be less dense than the second.  Pressure, temperature, and humidity have a great influence  on aircraft performance because of their effect upon density.  There are no rules of thumb that can be easily applied, but  the affect of humidity can be determined using several online  formulas. In the first example, the pressure is needed at the  altitude for which density altitude is being sought. Using  Figure 4-2,  select the barometric pressure closest to the  associated altitude. As an example, the pressure at 8,000 feet  is  $22.22\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  . Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) website (www.srh.noaa.gov/ epz/?n  $=$  w x calc density altitude) for density altitude, enter  the 22.22 for 8,000 feet in the station pressure window. Enter  a temperature of   $80^{\circ}$   and a dew point of  $75^{\circ}$  . The result is a  density altitude of 11,564 feet. With no humidity, the density  altitude would be almost 500 feet lower.  

Another website (www.wahiduddin.net/calc/density_ altitude.htm) provides a more straight forward method of  determining the effects of humidity on density altitude  without using additional interpretive charts. In any case, the  effects of humidity on density altitude include a decrease in  overall performance in high humidity conditions.  

# Theories in the Production of Lift  

In order to achieve flight in a machine that is heavier than air,  there are several obstacles we must overcome. One of those  obstacles, discussed previously, is the resistance to movement  called drag. The most challenging obstacle to overcome in  aviation, however, is the force of gravity. A wing moving  through air generates the force called lift, also previously  discussed. Lift from the wing that is greater than the force of  gravity, directed opposite to the direction of gravity, enables  an aircraft to fly. Generating this force called lift is based on  some important principles, Newton's basic laws of motion,  and Bernoulli's principle of differential pressure.  

# Newton’s Basic Laws of Motion  

The formulation of lift has historically been an adaptation  over the past few centuries of basic physical laws. These  laws, although seemingly applicable to all aspects of lift,  do not explain how lift is formulated. In fact, one must  consider the many airfoils that are symmetrical, yet produce  significant lift.  

The fundamental physical laws governing the forces acting  upon an aircraft in flight were adopted from postulated  theories developed before any human successfully flew  an aircraft. The use of these physical laws grew out of the  Scientific Revolution, which began in Europe in the 1600s.  Driven by the belief the universe operated in a predictable  manner open to human understanding, many philosophers,  mathematicians, natural scientists, and inventors spent their  lives unlocking the secrets of the universe. One of the most  well-known was Sir Isaac Newton, who not only formulated  the law of universal gravitation, but also described the three  basic laws of motion.  

Newton’s First Law: “Every object persists in its state of rest  or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to  change that state by forces impressed on it.”  

This means that nothing starts or stops moving until some  outside force causes it to do so. An aircraft at rest on the ramp  remains at rest unless a force strong enough to overcome  its inertia is applied. Once it is moving, its inertia keeps  it moving, subject to the various other forces acting on it.  These forces may add to its motion, slow it down, or change  its direction.  

Newton’s Second Law: “Force is equal to the change in  momentum per change in time. For a constant mass, force  equals mass times acceleration.”  

When a body is acted upon by a constant force, its resulting  acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the body  and is directly proportional to the applied force. This takes  into account the factors involved in overcoming Newton’s  First Law. It covers both changes in direction and speed,  including starting up from rest (positive acceleration) and  coming to a stop (negative acceleration or deceleration).  

Newton’s Third Law: “For every action, there is an equal  and opposite reaction.”  

In an airplane, the propeller moves and pushes back the  air; consequently, the air pushes the propeller (and thus the  airplane) in the opposite direction—forward. In a jet airplane,  the engine pushes a blast of hot gases backward; the force of  equal and opposite reaction pushes against the engine and  forces the airplane forward.  

# Bernoulli’s Principle of Differential Pressure  

A half-century after Newton formulated his laws, Daniel  Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician, explained how the pressure  of a moving fluid (liquid or gas) varies with its speed of  motion. Bernoulli’s Principle states that as the velocity of a  moving fluid (liquid or gas) increases, the pressure within  the fluid decreases. This principle explains what happens to  air passing over the curved top of the airplane wing.  

A practical application of Bernoulli’s Principle is the venturi  tube. The venturi tube has an air inlet that narrows to a  throat (constricted point) and an outlet section that increases  in diameter toward the rear. The diameter of the outlet is  the same as that of the inlet. The mass of air entering the  tube must exactly equal the mass exiting the tube. At the  constriction, the speed must increase to allow the same  amount of air to pass in the same amount of time as in all  other parts of the tube. When the air speeds up, the pressure  also decreases. Past the constriction, the airflow slows and  the pressure increases.  [Figure 4-4]  

Since air is recognized as a body, and it is understood that  air will follow the above laws, one can begin to see how  and why an airplane wing develops lift. As the wing moves  through the air, the flow of air across the curved top surface  increases in velocity creating a low-pressure area.  

Although Newton, Bernoulli, and hundreds of other early  scientists who studied the physical laws of the universe did  not have the sophisticated laboratories available today, they  provided great insight to the contemporary viewpoint of how  lift is created.  

# Airfoil Design  

An airfoil is a structure designed to obtain reaction upon its  surface from the air through which it moves or that moves  past such a structure. Air acts in various ways when submitted  to different pressures and velocities; but this discussion  is confined to the parts of an aircraft that a pilot is most  concerned with in flight—namely, the airfoils designed to  produce lift. By looking at a typical airfoil profile, such as  the cross section of a wing, one can see several obvious  characteristics of design.  [Figure 4-5]  Notice that there is  a difference in the curvatures (called cambers) of the upper  and lower surfaces of the airfoil. The camber of the upper  surface is more pronounced than that of the lower surface,  which is usually somewhat flat.  

NOTE: The two extremities of the airfoil profile also differ in  appearance. The rounded end, which faces forward in flight,  is called the leading edge; the other end, the trailing edge, is  quite narrow and tapered.  

A reference line often used in discussing the airfoil is  the chord line, a straight line drawn through the profile  connecting the extremities of the leading and trailing edges.  The distance from this chord line to the upper and lower  surfaces of the wing denotes the magnitude of the upper and  lower camber at any point. Another reference line, drawn

from the leading edge to the trailing edge, is the mean camber  line. This mean line is equidistant at all points from the upper  and lower surfaces.  

An airfoil is constructed in such a way that its shape takes  advantage of the air’s response to certain physical laws. This  develops two actions from the air mass: a positive pressure  lifting action from the air mass below the wing, and a negative  pressure lifting action from lowered pressure above the wing.  

As the air stream strikes the relatively flat lower surface of  a wing or rotor blade when inclined at a small angle to its  direction of motion, the air is forced to rebound downward,  causing an upward reaction in positive lift. At the same time,  the air stream striking the upper curved section of the leading  edge is deflected upward. An airfoil is shaped to cause an  action on the air, and forces air downward, which provides  an equal reaction from the air, forcing the airfoil upward. If  a wing is constructed in such form that it causes a lift force  greater than the weight of the aircraft, the aircraft will fly.  

If all the lift required were obtained merely from the  deflection of air by the lower surface of the wing, an aircraft  would only need a flat wing like a kite. However, the balance  of the lift needed to support the aircraft comes from the flow  of air above the wing. Herein lies the key to flight.  

It is neither accurate nor useful to assign specific values to the  percentage of lift generated by the upper surface of an airfoil  versus that generated by the lower surface. These are not  constant values. They vary, not only with flight conditions,  but also with different wing designs.  

Different airfoils have different flight characteristics. Many  thousands of airfoils have been tested in wind tunnels and in  actual flight, but no one airfoil has been found that satisfies  every flight requirement. The weight, speed, and purpose  of each aircraft dictate the shape of its airfoil. The most  efficient airfoil for producing the greatest lift is one that has  a concave or “scooped out” lower surface. As a fixed design,  this type of airfoil sacrifices too much speed while producing  lift and is not suitable for high-speed flight. Advancements  in engineering have made it possible for today’s high-speed  jets to take advantage of the concave airfoil’s high lift  characteristics. Leading edge (Kreuger) flaps and trailing  edge (Fowler) flaps, when extended from the basic wing  structure, literally change the airfoil shape into the classic  concave form, thereby generating much greater lift during  slow flight conditions.  

On the other hand, an airfoil that is perfectly streamlined  and offers little wind resistance sometimes does not have  enough lifting power to take the airplane off the ground.  Thus, modern airplanes have airfoils that strike a medium  between extremes in design. The shape varies according to  the needs of the airplane for which it is designed.  Figure 4-6 shows some of the more common airfoil designs.  

# Low Pressure Above  

In a wind tunnel or in flight, an airfoil is simply a streamlined  object inserted into a moving stream of air. If the airfoil  profile were in the shape of a teardrop, the speed and the  pressure changes of the air passing over the top and bottom  would be the same on both sides. But if the teardrop shaped  airfoil were cut in half lengthwise, a form resembling the  basic airfoil (wing) section would result. If the airfoil were  then inclined so the airflow strikes it at an angle, the air  moving over the upper surface would be forced to move  faster than the air moving along the bottom of the airfoil.  This increased velocity reduces the pressure above the airfoil.  

Applying Bernoulli’s Principle of Pressure, the increase in  the speed of the air across the top of an airfoil produces a

drop in pressure. This lowered pressure is a component of  total lift. The pressure difference between the upper and  lower surface of a wing alone does not account for the total  lift force produced.  

The downward backward flow from the top surface of an  airfoil creates a downwash. This downwash meets the flow  from the bottom of the airfoil at the trailing edge. Applying  Newton’s third law, the reaction of this downward backward  flow results in an upward forward force on the airfoil.  

# High Pressure Below  

A certain amount of lift is generated by pressure conditions  underneath the airfoil. Because of the manner in which air  flows underneath the airfoil, a positive pressure results,  particularly at higher angles of attack. However, there is  another aspect to this airflow that must be considered. At a  point close to the leading edge, the airflow is virtually stopped  (stagnation point) and then gradually increases speed. At  some point near the trailing edge, it again reaches a velocity  equal to that on the upper surface. In conformance with  Bernoulli’s principle, where the airflow was slowed beneath  the airfoil, a positive upward pressure was created (i.e., as  the fluid speed decreases, the pressure must increase). Since  the pressure differential between the upper and lower surface  of the airfoil increases, total lift increases. Both Bernoulli’s  Principle and Newton’s Laws are in operation whenever lift  is being generated by an airfoil.  

# Pressure Distribution  

From experiments conducted on wind tunnel models and on  full size airplanes, it has been determined that as air flows  along the surface of a wing at different angles of attack  (AOA), there are regions along the surface where the pressure  is negative, or less than atmospheric, and regions where the  pressure is positive, or greater than atmospheric. This negative  pressure on the upper surface creates a relatively larger force  on the wing than is caused by the positive pressure resulting  from the air striking the lower wing surface.  Figure 4-7  shows  the pressure distribution along an airfoil at three different  angles of attack. The average of the pressure variation for  any given AOA is referred to as the center of pressure (CP).  Aerodynamic force acts through this CP. At high angles of  attack, the CP moves forward, while at low angles of attack  the CP moves aft. In the design of wing structures, this CP  travel is very important, since it affects the position of the  air loads imposed on the wing structure in both low and high  AOA conditions. An airplane’s aerodynamic balance and  controllability are governed by changes in the CP.  

# Airfoil Behavior  

Although specific examples can be cited in which each of  the principles predict and contribute to the formation of lift,  

![](images/812cdb5aaecd12b4f175d3ea5d8100a7d2811828c5c1e3122c99b02a5e901ece.jpg)

lift is a complex subject. The production of lift is much more  complex than a simple differential pressure between upper  and lower airfoil surfaces. In fact, many lifting airfoils do  not have an upper surface longer than the bottom, as in the  case of symmetrical airfoils. These are seen in high-speed  aircraft having symmetrical wings, or on symmetrical rotor  blades for many helicopters whose upper and lower surfaces  are identical. In both examples, the only difference is the  relationship of the airfoil with the oncoming airstream  (angle). A paper airplane, which is simply a flat plate, has a  bottom and top exactly the same shape and length. Yet, these  airfoils do produce lift, and “flow turning” is partly (or fully)  responsible for creating lift.  

As an airfoil moves through air, the airfoil is inclined  against the airflow, producing a different flow caused by the  airfoil’s relationship to the oncoming air. Think of a hand  being placed outside the car window at a high speed. If the  hand is inclined in one direction or another, the hand will  move upward or downward. This is caused by deflection,  which in turn causes the air to turn about the object within  the air stream. As a result of this change, the velocity about  the object changes in both magnitude and direction, in turn  resulting in a measurable velocity force and direction.  

# A Third Dimension  

To this point, the discussion has centered on the flow across  the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil. While most of the  lift is produced by these two dimensions, a third dimension,  the tip of the airfoil also has an aerodynamic effect. The high- pressure area on the bottom of an airfoil pushes around the tip  to the low-pressure area on the top.  [Figure 4-8]  This action  creates a rotating flow called a tip vortex. The vortex flows  behind the airfoil creating a downwash that extends back to  the trailing edge of the airfoil. This downwash results in an  overall reduction in lift for the affected portion of the airfoil.  Manufacturers have developed different methods to  counteract this action. Winglets can be added to the tip of  an airfoil to reduce this flow. The winglets act as a dam  preventing the vortex from forming. Winglets can be on the  top or bottom of the airfoil. Another method of countering  the flow is to taper the airfoil tip, reducing the pressure  differential and smoothing the airflow around the tip.

Modern general aviation aircraft have what may be considered  high performance characteristics. Therefore, it is increasingly  necessary that pilots appreciate and understand the principles  upon which the art of flying is based.

# Chapter 5 Aerodynamics  of Flight  

# Forces Acting on the Aircraft  

Thrust, drag, lift, and weight are forces that act upon all  aircraft in flight. Understanding how these forces work and  knowing how to control them with the use of power and  flight controls are essential to flight. This chapter discusses  the aerodynamics of flight—how design, weight, load factors,  and gravity affect an aircraft during flight maneuvers.  

The four forces acting on an aircraft in straight-and-level,  unaccelerated flight are thrust, drag, lift, and weight. They  are defined as follows:  

•	 Thrust—the forward force produced by the powerplant/  propeller or rotor. It opposes or overcomes the force  of drag. As a general rule, it acts parallel to the  longitudinal axis. However, this is not always the case,  as explained later.  

•	 Drag—a rearward, retarding force caused by disruption  of airflow by the wing, rotor, fuselage, and other  protruding objects. As a general rule, drag opposes  thrust and acts rearward parallel to the relative wind.  

•	 Lift—is a force that is produced by the dynamic effect  of the air acting on the airfoil, and acts perpendicular  to the flight path through the center of lift (CL) and  perpendicular to the lateral axis. In level flight, lift  opposes the downward force of weight.  

•	 Weight—the combined load of the aircraft itself, the  crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight is  a force that pulls the aircraft downward because of  the force of gravity. It opposes lift and acts vertically  downward through the aircraft’s center of gravity (CG).  

In steady flight, the sum of these opposing forces is always  zero. There can be no unbalanced forces in steady, straight  flight based upon Newton’s Third Law, which states that for  every action or force there is an equal, but opposite, reaction  or force. This is true whether flying level or when climbing  or descending.  

It does not mean the four forces are equal. It means the  opposing forces are equal to, and thereby cancel, the effects of  each other. In  Figure 5-1,  the force vectors of thrust, drag, lift,  and weight appear to be equal in value. The usual explanation  states (without stipulating that thrust and drag do not equal  weight and lift) that thrust equals drag and lift equals weight.  Although true, this statement can be misleading. It should be  understood that in straight, level, unaccelerated flight, it is  true that the opposing lift/weight forces are equal. They are  also greater than the opposing forces of thrust/drag that are  equal only to each other. Therefore, in steady flight:  

•	 The sum of all upward components of forces (not just  lift) equals the sum of all downward components of  forces (not just weight)  •	 The sum of all forward components of forces (not just  thrust) equals the sum of all backward components of  forces (not just drag)  

This refinement of the old “thrust equals drag; lift equals  weight” formula explains that a portion of thrust is directed  upward in climbs and slow flight and acts as if it were lift  while a portion of weight is directed backward opposite to the  direction of flight and acts as if it were drag. In slow flight,  

![](images/4475a79a48f77d834258f4bb1b2632a5d0bd6f042eb51285a98b73103dcf3bec.jpg)  
Figure 5-1.  Relationship of forces acting on an aircraft.  

thrust has an upward component. But because the aircraft is in  level flight, weight does not contribute to drag.  [Figure 5-2]  

In glides, a portion of the weight vector is directed along  the forward flight path and, therefore, acts as thrust. In other  words, any time the flight path of the aircraft is not horizontal,  lift, weight, thrust, and drag vectors must each be broken down  into two components.  

Another important concept to understand is angle of attack  (AOA). Since the early days of flight, AOA is fundamental to  understanding many aspects of airplane performance, stability,  and control. The AOA is defined as the acute angle between the  chord line of the airfoil and the direction of the relative wind.  

Discussions of the preceding concepts are frequently omitted  in aeronautical texts/handbooks/manuals. The reason is  not that they are inconsequential, but because the main  ideas with respect to the aerodynamic forces acting upon  an aircraft in flight can be presented in their most essential  elements without being involved in the technicalities of the  aerodynamicist. In point of fact, considering only level flight,  and normal climbs and glides in a steady state, it is still true  that lift provided by the wing or rotor is the primary upward  force, and weight is the primary downward force.  

By using the aerodynamic forces of thrust, drag, lift, and  weight, pilots can fly a controlled, safe flight. A more detailed  discussion of these forces follows.  

# Thrust  

For an aircraft to start moving, thrust must be exerted and be  greater than drag. The aircraft continues to move and gain  speed until thrust and drag are equal. In order to maintain a  

![](images/5b1f7693b8b702ef76a79d74ffe7a20cb7235a42a6483770a4a8ce4887197583.jpg)  
Figure 5-2.  Force vectors during a stabilized climb.  

constant airspeed, thrust and drag must remain equal, just as  lift and weight must be equal to maintain a constant altitude.  If in level flight, the engine power is reduced, the thrust is  lessened, and the aircraft slows down. As long as the thrust  is less than the drag, the aircraft continues to decelerate. To  a point, as the aircraft slows down, the drag force will also  decrease. The aircraft will continue to slow down until thrust  again equals drag at which point the airspeed will stabilize.  

Likewise, if the engine power is increased, thrust becomes  greater than drag and the airspeed increases. As long as  the thrust continues to be greater than the drag, the aircraft  continues to accelerate. When drag equals thrust, the aircraft  flies at a constant airspeed.  

Straight-and-level flight may be sustained at a wide range  of speeds. The pilot coordinates AOA and thrust in all  speed regimes if the aircraft is to be held in level flight. An  important fact related to the principal of lift (for a given  airfoil shape) is that lift varies with the AOA and airspeed.  Therefore, a large AOA at low airspeeds produces an equal  amount of lift at high airspeeds with a low AOA. The speed  regimes of flight can be grouped in three categories: low- speed flight, cruising flight, and high-speed flight.  

When the airspeed is low, the AOA must be relatively high  if the balance between lift and weight is to be maintained.  [Figure 5-3]  If thrust decreases and airspeed decreases, lift  will become less than weight and the aircraft will start to  descend. To maintain level flight, the pilot can increase the  AOA an amount that generates a lift force again equal to the  weight of the aircraft. While the aircraft will be flying more  slowly, it will still maintain level flight. The AOA is adjusted  to maintain lift equal weight. The airspeed will naturally  adjust until drag equals thrust and then maintain that airspeed  (assumes the pilot is not trying to hold an exact speed).  

Straight-and-level flight in the slow-speed regime provides  some interesting conditions relative to the equilibrium of  forces. With the aircraft in a nose-high attitude, there is a  vertical component of thrust that helps support it. For one  thing, wing loading tends to be less than would be expected.  

In level flight, when thrust is increased, the aircraft speeds  up and the lift increases. The aircraft will start to climb  unless the AOA is decreased just enough to maintain the  relationship between lift and weight. The timing of this  decrease in AOA needs to be coordinated with the increase  in thrust and airspeed. Otherwise, if the AOA is decreased too  fast, the aircraft will descend, and if the AOA is decreased  too slowly, the aircraft will climb.  

As the airspeed varies due to thrust, the AOA must also vary  to maintain level flight. At very high speeds and level flight,  it is even possible to have a slightly negative AOA.  As thrust  is reduced and airspeed decreases, the AOA must increase  in order to maintain altitude. If speed decreases enough, the  required AOA will increase to the critical AOA. Any further  increase in the AOA will result in the wing stalling. Therefore,  extra vigilance is required at reduced thrust settings and low  speeds so as not to exceed the critical angle of attack. If the  airplane is equipped with an AOA indicator, it should be  referenced to help monitor the proximity to the critical AOA.  

Some aircraft have the ability to change the direction of the  thrust rather than changing the AOA. This is accomplished  either by pivoting the engines or by vectoring the exhaust  gases.  [Figure 5-4]  

# Lift  

The pilot can control the lift. Any time the control yoke  or stick is moved fore or aft, the AOA is changed. As the  AOA increases, lift increases (all other factors being equal).  When the aircraft reaches the maximum AOA, lift begins  to diminish rapidly. This is the stalling AOA, known as 

  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}}$   critical AOA. Examine  Figure 5-5,  noting how the 

  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   increases until the critical AOA is reached, then decreases  rapidly with any further increase in the AOA.  

Before proceeding further with the topic of lift and how it  can be controlled, velocity must be discussed. The shape of  the wing or rotor cannot be effective unless it continually  keeps “attacking” new air. If an aircraft is to keep flying, the  lift-producing airfoil must keep moving. In a helicopter or  gyroplane, this is accomplished by the rotation of the rotor  blades. For other types of aircraft, such as airplanes, weight-  

![](images/5c489dc8bec32f3bdac39e90c8509fcae9c78326d3a6fdd3f8c5246851db8b89.jpg)

Figure 5-4.  Some aircraft have the ability to change the direction of thrust.  

shift control, or gliders, air must be moving across the lifting  surface. This is accomplished by the forward speed of the  aircraft. Lift is proportional to the square of the aircraft’s  velocity. For example, an airplane traveling at 200 knots has  four times the lift as the same airplane traveling at 100 knots,  if the AOA and other factors remain constant.  

$$
{\mathsf{L}}={\frac{\mathsf{C_{L}}\cdot{\mathsf{\rho}}\cdot{\mathsf{V}}^{2}\cdot{\mathsf{S}}}{2}}
$$  

The above lift equation exemplifies this mathematically  and supports that doubling of the airspeed will result in four  times the lift.  As a result, one can see that velocity is an  important component to the production of lift, which itself  can be affected through varying AOA.  When examining the  equation, lift (L) is determined through the relationship of the  air density ( ρ ), the airfoil velocity (V), the surface area of the  wing (S) and the coefficient of lift   $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}})$   for a given airfoil.  

Taking the equation further, one can see an aircraft could  not continue to travel in level flight at a constant altitude and  maintain the same AOA if the velocity is increased. The lift  would increase and the aircraft would climb as a result of  the increased lift force or speed up. Therefore, to keep the  aircraft straight and level (not accelerating upward) and in a  state of equilibrium, as velocity is increased, lift must be kept  constant. This is normally accomplished by reducing the AOA  by lowering the nose. Conversely, as the aircraft is slowed, the  decreasing velocity requires increasing the AOA to maintain  lift sufficient to maintain flight. There is, of course, a limit to  how far the AOA can be increased, if a stall is to be avoided.  

All other factors being constant, for every AOA there is  a corresponding airspeed required to maintain altitude in  steady, unaccelerated flight (true only if maintaining level  flight). Since an airfoil always stalls at the same AOA, if  increasing weight, lift must also be increased. The only  

![](images/8afc0e0849d989cf9c48445c69ecd7b8f516ff9b209e65d41953684c6ebd3002.jpg)  
Figure 5-5.  Coefficients of lift and drag at various angles of attack.  

method of increasing lift is by increasing velocity if the AOA  is held constant just short of the “critical,” or stalling, AOA  (assuming no flaps or other high lift devices).  

Lift and drag also vary directly with the density of the air.  Density is affected by several factors: pressure, temperature,  and humidity. At an altitude of 18,000 feet, the density of  the air has one-half the density of air at sea level. In order to  maintain its lift at a higher altitude, an aircraft must fly at a  greater true airspeed for any given AOA.  

Warm air is less dense than cool air, and moist air is less  dense than dry air. Thus, on a hot humid day, an aircraft  must be flown at a greater true airspeed for any given AOA  than on a cool, dry day.  

If the density factor is decreased and the total lift must equal  the total weight to remain in flight, it follows that one of the  other factors must be increased. The factor usually increased  is the airspeed or the AOA because these are controlled  directly by the pilot.  

Lift varies directly with the wing area, provided there is no  change in the wing’s planform. If the wings have the same  proportion and airfoil sections, a wing with a planform area  of 200 square feet lifts twice as much at the same AOA as a  wing with an area of 100 square feet.  

Two major aerodynamic factors from the pilot’s viewpoint  are lift and airspeed because they can be controlled readily  and accurately. Of course, the pilot can also control density by  adjusting the altitude and can control wing area if the aircraft  happens to have flaps of the type that enlarge wing area.  However, for most situations, the pilot controls lift and airspeed  to maneuver an aircraft. For instance, in straight-and-level flight,  cruising along at a constant altitude, altitude is maintained by  adjusting lift to match the aircraft’s velocity or cruise airspeed,  while maintaining a state of equilibrium in which lift equals  weight. In an approach to landing, when the pilot wishes to  land as slowly as practical, it is necessary to increase AOA near  maximum to maintain lift equal to the weight of the aircraft.  

# Lift/Drag Ratio  

The lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) is the amount of lift generated by  a wing or airfoil compared to its drag. A ratio of L/D indicates  airfoil efficiency. Aircraft with higher L/D ratios are more  efficient than those with lower L/D ratios. In unaccelerated  flight with the lift and drag data steady, the proportions of  the coefficient of lift   $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}})$   and coefficient of drag   $(C_{\mathrm{D}})$   can  be calculated for specific AOA.  [Figure 5-5]  

The coefficient of lift is dimensionless and relates the lift  generated by a lifting body, the dynamic pressure of the fluid  flow around the body, and a reference area associated with  the body. The coefficient of drag is also dimensionless and is  used to quantify the drag of an object in a fluid environment,  such as air, and is always associated with a particular surface  area.  

The   $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{D}$   ratio is determined by dividing the  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   by the  $\mathrm{C_{D}}$  ,  which is the same as dividing the lift equation by the drag  equation as all of the variables, aside from the coefficients,  cancel out. The lift and drag equations are as follows   $\mathrm{(L=}$  Lift in pounds; D = Drag;  $\mathrm{C_{L}}\mathrm{=}$   coefficient of lift;  $\uprho\,{=}\,$   density  (expressed in slugs per cubic feet);   $\mathrm{V}=$   velocity (in feet per  second);  $\mathbf{q}=$  dynamic pressure per square foot   $(\mathsf{q}=\mathrm{\mathbb{V}}_{2}\,\mathsf{p}\mathrm{\mathbf{v}}^{2})$  ;
  $S=$   the area of the lifting body (in square feet); and
  $\mathrm{C_{D}}\!=$   Ratio of drag pressure to dynamic pressure):  

$$
\mathsf{D}=\frac{\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}\cdot\mathsf{P}\cdot\mathsf{V}^{2}\cdot\mathsf{S}}{2}
$$  

Typically at low AOA, the coefficient of drag is low and  small changes in AOA create only slight changes in the  coefficient of drag. At high AOA, small changes in the AOA  cause significant changes in drag. The shape of an airfoil, as  well as changes in the AOA, affects the production of lift.  

Notice in  Figure 5-5  that the coefficient of lift curve (red)  reaches its maximum for this particular wing section at  $20^{\circ}$  AOA and then rapidly decreases.  $20^{\circ}$   AOA is therefore the  critical angle of attack. The coefficient of drag curve (orange)  increases very rapidly from   $14^{\circ}$   AOA and completely  overcomes the lift curve at   $21^{\circ}$   AOA. The lift/drag ratio  (green) reaches its maximum at  $6^{\circ}$   AOA, meaning that at this  angle, the most lift is obtained for the least amount of drag.  

Note that the maximum lift/drag ratio   $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$   occurs at  one specific  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   and AOA. If the aircraft is operated in steady  flight at  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  , the total drag is at a minimum. Any AOA  lower or higher than that for  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$   reduces the  $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{D}$   and  consequently increases the total drag for a given aircraft’s  

![](images/52a05d230e1b26a4ebb3070bab6b6437ce6a67f4da9ff03f1d0d83c8a5d02e65.jpg)

lift.  Figure 5-6  depicts the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$   by the lowest portion of  the blue line labeled “total drag.” The configuration of an  aircraft has a great effect on the L/D.  

# Drag  

Drag is the force that resists movement of an aircraft through  the air. There are two basic types: parasite drag and induced  drag. The first is called parasite because it in no way functions  to aid flight, while the second, induced drag, is a result of an  airfoil developing lift.  

# Parasite Drag  

Parasite drag is comprised of all the forces that work to slow  an aircraft’s movement. As the term parasite implies, it is the  drag that is not associated with the production of lift. This  includes the displacement of the air by the aircraft, turbulence  generated in the airstream, or a hindrance of air moving over  the surface of the aircraft and airfoil. There are three types of  parasite drag: form drag, interference drag, and skin friction.  

# Form Drag  

Form drag is the portion of parasite drag generated by the  aircraft due to its shape and airflow around it. Examples include  the engine cowlings, antennas, and the aerodynamic shape of  other components. When the air has to separate to move around  a moving aircraft and its components, it eventually rejoins  after passing the body. How quickly and smoothly it rejoins is  representative of the resistance that it creates, which requires  additional force to overcome.  [Figure 5-7]  

Notice how the flat plate in  Figure 5-7  causes the air to swirl  around the edges until it eventually rejoins downstream. Form  

![](images/13611bfa32eda0ea8c4ea55386c5b5fcfc04428e25961794978460d37c3e9815.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.  Form drag.  

drag is the easiest to reduce when designing an aircraft. The  solution is to streamline as many of the parts as possible.  

# Interference Drag  

Interference drag comes from the intersection of airstreams  that creates eddy currents, turbulence, or restricts smooth  airflow. For example, the intersection of the wing and the  fuselage at the wing root has significant interference drag.  Air flowing around the fuselage collides with air flowing over  the wing, merging into a current of air different from the two  original currents. The most interference drag is observed when  two surfaces meet at perpendicular angles. Fairings are used  to reduce this tendency. If a jet fighter carries two identical  wing tanks, the overall drag is greater than the sum of the  individual tanks because both of these create and generate  interference drag. Fairings and distance between lifting  surfaces and external components (such as radar antennas  hung from wings) reduce interference drag.  [Figure 5-8]  

# Skin Friction Drag  

Skin friction drag is the aerodynamic resistance due to the  contact of moving air with the surface of an aircraft. Every  surface, no matter how apparently smooth, has a rough,  ragged surface when viewed under a microscope. The air  molecules, which come in direct contact with the surface of  the wing, are virtually motionless. Each layer of molecules  above the surface moves slightly faster until the molecules  are moving at the velocity of the air moving around the  aircraft. This speed is called the free-stream velocity. The area  between the wing and the free-stream velocity level is about as  wide as a playing card and is called the boundary layer. At the  top of the boundary layer, the molecules increase velocity and  move at the same speed as the molecules outside the boundary  layer. The actual speed at which the molecules move depends  upon the shape of the wing, the viscosity (stickiness) of  the air through which the wing or airfoil is moving, and its  compressibility (how much it can be compacted).  

![](images/eb1af0e8afa94f8ced214efb459f75e3e8c3de5c9a03c31c70ad3edc4993af26.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.  A wing root can cause interference drag.  

The airflow outside of the boundary layer reacts to the  shape of the edge of the boundary layer just as it would  to the physical surface of an object. The boundary layer  gives any object an “effective” shape that is usually slightly  different from the physical shape. The boundary layer may  also separate from the body, thus creating an effective shape  much different from the physical shape of the object. This  change in the physical shape of the boundary layer causes a  dramatic decrease in lift and an increase in drag. When this  happens, the airfoil has stalled.  

In order to reduce the effect of skin friction drag, aircraft  designers utilize flush mount rivets and remove any  irregularities that may protrude above the wing surface. In  addition, a smooth and glossy finish aids in transition of  air across the surface of the wing. Since dirt on an aircraft  disrupts the free flow of air and increases drag, keep the  surfaces of an aircraft clean and waxed.  

# Induced Drag  

The second basic type of drag is induced drag. It is an  established physical fact that no system that does work in the  mechanical sense can be 100 percent efficient. This means  that whatever the nature of the system, the required work  is obtained at the expense of certain additional work that is  dissipated or lost in the system. The more efficient the system,  the smaller this loss.  

In level flight, the aerodynamic properties of a wing or rotor  produce a required lift, but this can be obtained only at the  expense of a certain penalty. The name given to this penalty  is induced drag. Induced drag is inherent whenever an airfoil  is producing lift and, in fact, this type of drag is inseparable  from the production of lift. Consequently, it is always present  if lift is produced.  

An airfoil (wing or rotor blade) produces the lift force by  making use of the energy of the free airstream. Whenever  an airfoil is producing lift, the pressure on the lower surface  of it is greater than that on the upper surface (Bernoulli’s  Principle). As a result, the air tends to flow from the high  pressure area below the tip upward to the low pressure area  on the upper surface. In the vicinity of the tips, there is a  tendency for these pressures to equalize, resulting in a lateral  flow outward from the underside to the upper surface. This  lateral flow imparts a rotational velocity to the air at the tips,  creating vortices that trail behind the airfoil.  

When the aircraft is viewed from the tail, these vortices  circulate counterclockwise about the right tip and clockwise  about the left tip.  [Figure 5-9]  As the air (and vortices) roll off  the back of your wing, they angle down, which is known as  downwash.  Figure 5-10  shows the difference in downwash at  

![](images/9c56bbd5ffc9ea6c79a596b93cf4a178371bafe372131b070193cc49d1ca93ea.jpg)

altitude versus near the ground. Bearing in mind the direction  of rotation of these vortices, it can be seen that they induce  an upward flow of air beyond the tip and a downwash flow  behind the wing’s trailing edge. This induced downwash has  nothing in common with the downwash that is necessary to  produce lift. It is, in fact, the source of induced drag.  

Downwash points the relative wind downward, so the more  downwash you have, the more your relative wind points  downward. That's important for one very good reason: lift is  always perpendicular to the relative wind. In  Figure 5-11,  you  can see that when you have less downwash, your lift vector  is more vertical, opposing gravity. And when you have more  downwash, your lift vector points back more, causing induced  drag. On top of that, it takes energy for your wings to create  downwash and vortices, and that energy creates drag.

Figure 5-11.  The difference in downwash at altitude versus near  the ground.  

The greater the size and strength of the vortices and  consequent downwash component on the net airflow over  the airfoil, the greater the induced drag effect becomes. This  downwash over the top of the airfoil at the tip has the same  effect as bending the lift vector rearward; therefore, the lift  is slightly aft of perpendicular to the relative wind, creating  a rearward lift component. This is induced drag.  

In order to create a greater negative pressure on the top of an  airfoil, the airfoil can be inclined to a higher AOA. If the AOA  of a symmetrical airfoil were zero, there would be no pressure  differential, and consequently, no downwash component and  no induced drag. In any case, as AOA increases, induced  drag increases proportionally. To state this another way—the  lower the airspeed, the greater the AOA required to produce  lift equal to the aircraft’s weight and, therefore, the greater  induced drag. The amount of induced drag varies inversely  with the square of the airspeed.  

Conversely, parasite drag increases as the square of the  airspeed. Thus, in steady state, as airspeed decreases to  near the stalling speed, the total drag becomes greater, due  mainly to the sharp rise in induced drag. Similarly, as the  aircraft reaches its never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  , the total drag  increases rapidly due to the sharp increase of parasite drag.  As seen in  Figure 5-6,  at some given airspeed, total drag is  at its minimum amount. In figuring the maximum range of  aircraft, the thrust required to overcome drag is at a minimum  if drag is at a minimum. The minimum power and maximum  endurance occur at a different point.  

# Weight  

Gravity is the pulling force that tends to draw all bodies to  the center of the earth. The CG may be considered as a point  at which all the weight of the aircraft is concentrated. If the  aircraft were supported at its exact CG, it would balance in  any attitude. It will be noted that CG is of major importance in  an aircraft, for its position has a great bearing upon stability. The allowable location of the CG is determined by the general  design of each particular aircraft. The designers determine  how far the center of pressure (CP) will travel. It is important  to understand that an aircraft’s weight is concentrated at the  CG and the aerodynamic forces of lift occur at the CP. When  the CG is forward of the CP, there is a natural tendency for the aircraft to want to pitch nose down. If the CP is forward of  the CG, a nose up pitching moment is created. Therefore,  designers fix the aft limit of the CG forward of the CP for the  corresponding flight speed in order to retain flight equilibrium.  

Weight has a definite relationship to lift. This relationship  is simple, but important in understanding the aerodynamics  of flying. Lift is the upward force on the wing acting  perpendicular to the relative wind and perpendicular to  the aircraft’s lateral axis. Lift is required to counteract the  aircraft’s weight. In stabilized level flight, when the lift force is  equal to the weight force, the aircraft is in a state of equilibrium  and neither accelerates upward or downward. If lift becomes  less than weight, the vertical speed will decrease. When lift is  greater than weight, the vertical speed will increase.  

# Wingtip Vortices  

# Formation of Vortices  

The action of the airfoil that gives an aircraft lift also causes  induced drag. When an airfoil is flown at a positive AOA,  a pressure differential exists between the upper and lower  surfaces of the airfoil. The pressure above the wing is less  than atmospheric pressure and the pressure below the wing  is equal to or greater than atmospheric pressure. Since air  always moves from high pressure toward low pressure,  and the path of least resistance is toward the airfoil’s tips,  there is a spanwise movement of air from the bottom of the  airfoil outward from the fuselage around the tips. This flow  of air results in “spillage” over the tips, thereby setting up a  whirlpool of air called a vortex.  [Figure 5-12]  

At the same time, the air on the upper surface has a tendency  to flow in toward the fuselage and off the trailing edge. This  air current forms a similar vortex at the inboard portion of the  trailing edge of the airfoil, but because the fuselage limits the  inward flow, the vortex is insignificant. Consequently, the  deviation in flow direction is greatest at the outer tips where  the unrestricted lateral flow is the strongest.  

![](images/548d73e4a4dfdbf396260f4bc70026adb10157d54f887855d006af546bb94e1b.jpg)  
Figure 5-12.  Wingtip vortices.  

As the air curls upward around the tip, it combines with the  downwash to form a fast-spinning trailing vortex. These  vortices increase drag because of energy spent in producing  the turbulence. Whenever an airfoil is producing lift, induced  drag occurs and wingtip vortices are created.  

Just as lift increases with an increase in AOA, induced  drag also increases. This occurs because as the AOA is  increased, there is a greater pressure difference between the  top and bottom of the airfoil, and a greater lateral flow of air;  consequently, this causes more violent vortices to be set up,  resulting in more turbulence and more induced drag.  

In  Figure 5-12,  it is easy to see the formation of wingtip  vortices. The intensity or strength of the vortices is directly  proportional to the weight of the aircraft and inversely  proportional to the wingspan and speed of the aircraft. The  heavier and slower the aircraft, the greater the AOA and the  stronger the wingtip vortices. Thus, an aircraft will create  wingtip vortices with maximum strength occurring during  the takeoff, climb, and landing phases of flight. These  vortices lead to a particularly dangerous hazard to flight,  wake turbulence.  

# Avoiding Wake Turbulence  

Wingtip vortices are greatest when the generating aircraft is  “heavy, clean, and slow.” This condition is most commonly  encountered during approaches or departures because an  aircraft’s AOA is at the highest to produce the lift necessary  to land or take off. To minimize the chances of flying through  an aircraft’s wake turbulence:  

•	 Avoid flying through another aircraft’s flight path. •	 Rotate prior to the point at which the preceding aircraft  rotated when taking off behind another aircraft. •	 Avoid following another aircraft on a similar flight  path at an altitude within 1,000 feet.  [Figure 5-13]  •	 Approach the runway above a preceding aircraft’s  path when landing behind another aircraft and touch  down after the point at which the other aircraft wheels  contacted the runway.  [Figure 5-14]  

A hovering helicopter generates a down wash from its main  rotor(s) similar to the vortices of an airplane. Pilots of small  aircraft should avoid a hovering helicopter by at least three  rotor disc diameters to avoid the effects of this down wash. In  forward flight, this energy is transformed into a pair of strong,  high-speed trailing vortices similar to wing-tip vortices of larger  fixed-wing aircraft. Helicopter vortices should be avoided  because helicopter forward flight airspeeds are often very  slow and can generate exceptionally strong wake turbulence.  

Wind is an important factor in avoiding wake turbulence  because wingtip vortices drift with the wind at the speed of the  wind. For example, a wind speed of 10 knots causes the vortices  to drift at about 1,000 feet in a minute in the wind direction.  When following another aircraft, a pilot should consider wind  speed and direction when selecting an intended takeoff or  landing point. If a pilot is unsure of the other aircraft’s takeoff  or landing point, approximately 3 minutes provides a margin of

Figure 5-15.  When the vortices of larger aircraft sink close to the ground (within 100 to 200 feet), they tend to move laterally over the  ground at a speed of 2 or 3 knots (top). A crosswind will decrease the lateral movement of the upwind vortex and increase the movement  of the downwind vortex. Thus a light wind with a cross runway component of 1 to 5 knots could result in the upwind vortex remaining in  the touchdown zone for a period of time and hasten the drift of the downwind vortex toward another runway (bottom).  

safety that allows wake turbulence dissipation.  [Figure 5-15] For more information on wake turbulence, see Advisory  Circular (AC) 90-23, Aircraft Wake Turbulence.  

# Ground Effect  

Ever since the beginning of manned flight, pilots realized  that just before touchdown it would suddenly feel like the  aircraft did not want to go lower, and it would just want to go  on and on. This is due to the air that is trapped between the  wing and the landing surface, as if there were an air cushion.  This phenomenon is called ground effect.  

When an aircraft in flight comes within several feet of the  surface, ground or water, a change occurs in the three- dimensional flow pattern around the aircraft because the  vertical component of the airflow around the wing is  restricted by the surface. This alters the wing’s upwash,  downwash, and wingtip vortices.  [Figure 5-16]  Ground  effect, then, is due to the interference of the ground (or water)  surface with the airflow patterns about the aircraft in flight. While the aerodynamic characteristics of the tail surfaces  and the fuselage are altered by ground effect, the principal  effects due to proximity of the ground are the changes in  the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. As the wing  encounters ground effect and is maintained at a constant  AOA, there is consequent reduction in the upwash,  downwash, and wingtip vortices.  

Induced drag is a result of the airfoil’s work of sustaining  the aircraft, and a wing or rotor lifts the aircraft simply by  accelerating a mass of air downward. It is true that reduced  pressure on top of an airfoil is essential to lift, but that is  only one of the things contributing to the overall effect of  pushing an air mass downward. The more downwash there  is, the harder the wing pushes the mass of air down. At high  angles of attack, the amount of induced drag is high; since this  corresponds to lower airspeeds in actual flight, it can be said  that induced drag predominates at low speed. However, the  reduction of the wingtip vortices due to ground effect alters  

![](images/da3d13d79b9ce9af7004a48ddd318a67bf3aa43b05aeb6f7c1b0bab260d1ec4a.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.  Ground effect changes airflow.  

the spanwise lift distribution and reduces the induced AOA  and induced drag. Therefore, the wing will require a lower  AOA in ground effect to produce the same  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}}$  . If a constant  AOA is maintained, an increase in  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   results.  [Figure 5-17]  

Ground effect also alters the thrust required versus velocity.  Since induced drag predominates at low speeds, the reduction  of induced drag due to ground effect will cause a significant  reduction of thrust required (parasite plus induced drag) at low  speeds. Due to the change in upwash, downwash, and wingtip  vortices, there may be a change in position (installation) error  of the airspeed system associated with ground effect. In the  majority of cases, ground effect causes an increase in the local  pressure at the static source and produces a lower indication  of airspeed and altitude. Thus, an aircraft may be airborne at  an indicated airspeed less than that normally required.  

In order for ground effect to be of significant magnitude, the  wing must be quite close to the ground. One of the direct  results of ground effect is the variation of induced drag with  wing height above the ground at a constant   $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  . When the  wing is at a height equal to its span, the reduction in induced  drag is only 1.4 percent. However, when the wing is at a  height equal to one-fourth its span, the reduction in induced  drag is 23.5 percent and, when the wing is at a height equal  to one-tenth its span, the reduction in induced drag is 47.6  percent. Thus, a large reduction in induced drag takes place  only when the wing is very close to the ground. Because of  this variation, ground effect is most usually recognized during  the liftoff for takeoff or just prior to touchdown when landing.  

![](images/82fc33b8c83715b51559c98d9f60825b426e9121f063ad764801ba148a4765ae.jpg)  
Figure 5-17.  Ground effect changes drag and lift.  

During the takeoff phase of flight, ground effect produces  some important relationships. An aircraft leaving ground  effect after takeoff encounters just the reverse of an aircraft  entering ground effect during landing. The aircraft leaving  ground effect will:  

•	 Require an increase in AOA to maintain the same  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}}$  •	 Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust  required •	 Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up  change in moment •	 Experience a reduction in static source pressure and  increase in indicated airspeed  

Ground effect must be considered during takeoffs and landings.  For example, if a pilot fails to understand the relationship  between the aircraft and ground effect during takeoff, a  hazardous situation is possible because the recommended  takeoff speed may not be achieved. Due to the reduced drag  in ground effect, the aircraft may seem capable of takeoff well  below the recommended speed. As the aircraft rises out of  ground effect with a deficiency of speed, the greater induced  drag may result in marginal initial climb performance. In  extreme conditions, such as high gross weight, high density  altitude, and high temperature, a deficiency of airspeed during  takeoff may permit the aircraft to become airborne but be  incapable of sustaining flight out of ground effect. In this case,  the aircraft may become airborne initially with a deficiency  of speed and then settle back to the runway.  

A pilot should not attempt to force an aircraft to become  airborne with a deficiency of speed. The manufacturer’s  recommended takeoff speed is necessary to provide adequate  initial climb performance. It is also important that a definite  climb be established before a pilot retracts the landing gear  or flaps. Never retract the landing gear or flaps prior to  establishing a positive rate of climb and only after achieving  a safe altitude.  

If, during the landing phase of flight, the aircraft is brought  into ground effect with a constant AOA, the aircraft  experiences an increase in  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   and a reduction in the thrust  required, and a “floating” effect may occur. Because of the  reduced drag and lack of power-off deceleration in ground  effect, any excess speed at the point of flare may incur a  considerable “float” distance. As the aircraft nears the point  of touchdown, ground effect is most realized at altitudes less  than the wingspan. During the final phases of the approach  as the aircraft nears the ground, a reduction of power is  necessary to offset the increase in lift caused from ground  effect otherwise the aircraft will have a tendency to climb  above the desired glidepath (GP).  

# Axes of an Aircraft  

The axes of an aircraft are three imaginary lines that pass  through an aircraft’s CG. The axes can be considered as  imaginary axles around which the aircraft turns. The three  axes pass through the CG at   $90^{\circ}$   angles to each other. The  axis passes through the CG and parallel to a line from nose  to tail is the longitudinal axis, the axis that passes parallel  to a line from wingtip to wingtip is the lateral axis, and the  axis that passes through the CG at right angles to the other  two axes is the vertical axis.   Whenever an aircraft changes  its flight attitude or position in flight, it rotates about one or  more of the three axes.  [Figure 5-18]  

The aircraft’s motion about its longitudinal axis resembles  the roll of a ship from side to side. In fact, the names  used to describe the motion about an aircraft’s three axes  were originally nautical terms. They have been adapted to  aeronautical terminology due to the similarity of motion of  aircraft and seagoing ships. The motion about the aircraft’s  longitudinal axis is “roll,” the motion about its lateral axis is  

![](images/9c290ccd6b32b390b8f8c2a9304944acfbe84f943394bb96380d9516ecbb09e5.jpg)  
Figure 5-18.  Axes of an airplane.  

“pitch,” and the motion about its vertical axis is “yaw.” Yaw  is the left and right movement of the aircraft’s nose.  

The three motions of the conventional airplane (roll, pitch,  and yaw) are controlled by three control surfaces. Roll is  controlled by the ailerons; pitch is controlled by the elevators;  yaw is controlled by the rudder. The use of these controls  is explained in Chapter 6, Flight Controls. Other types of  aircraft may utilize different methods of controlling the  movements about the various axes.  

For example, weight-shift control aircraft control two axes  (roll and pitch) using an “A” frame suspended from the  flexible wing attached to a three-wheeled carriage. These  aircraft are controlled by moving a horizontal bar (called a  control bar) in roughly the same way hang glider pilots fly.  [Figure 5-19]  They are termed weight-shift control aircraft  because the pilot controls the aircraft by shifting the CG.  For more information on weight-shift control aircraft, see  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Weight-Shift  Control Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-5. In the case of  powered parachutes, aircraft control is accomplished by  altering the airfoil via steering lines.  

A powered parachute wing is a parachute that has a cambered  upper surface and a flatter under surface. The two surfaces are  separated by ribs that act as cells, which open to the airflow  at the leading edge and have internal ports to allow lateral  airflow. The principle at work holds that the cell pressure is  greater than the outside pressure, thereby forming a wing that  maintains its airfoil shape in flight. The pilot and passenger  sit in tandem in front of the engine, which is located at the  rear of a vehicle. The airframe is attached to the parachute  via two attachment points and lines. Control is accomplished  by both power and the changing of the airfoil via the control  lines.  [Figure 5-20]

# Moment and Moment Arm  

A study of physics shows that a body that is free to rotate  will always turn about its CG. In aerodynamic terms, the  mathematical measure of an aircraft’s tendency to rotate  about its CG is called a “moment.” A moment is said to be  equal to the product of the force applied and the distance at  which the force is applied. (A moment arm is the distance  from a datum [reference point or line] to the applied force.)  For aircraft weight and balance computations, “moments”  are expressed in terms of the distance of the arm times the  aircraft’s weight, or simply, inch-pounds.  

Aircraft designers locate the fore and aft position of the  aircraft’s CG as nearly as possible to the 20 percent point  of the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC). If the thrust line  is designed to pass horizontally through the CG, it will not  cause the aircraft to pitch when power is changed, and there  will be no difference in moment due to thrust for a power-on  or power-off condition of flight. Although designers have  some control over the location of the drag forces, they are not  always able to make the resultant drag forces pass through the  CG of the aircraft. However, the one item over which they  have the greatest control is the size and location of the tail.  The objective is to make the moments (due to thrust, drag, and  lift) as small as possible and, by proper location of the tail,  to provide the means of balancing an aircraft longitudinally  for any condition of flight.  

The pilot has no direct control over the location of forces  acting on the aircraft in flight, except for controlling the  center of lift by changing the AOA. The pilot can control  the magnitude of the forces. Such a change, however,  immediately involves changes in other forces. Therefore,  the pilot cannot independently change the location of one  force without changing the effect of others. For example,  a change in airspeed involves a change in lift, as well as a  change in drag and a change in the up or down force on the  tail. As forces such as turbulence and gusts act to displace  the aircraft, the pilot reacts by providing opposing control  forces to counteract this displacement.  

Some aircraft are subject to changes in the location of the CG  with variations of load. Trimming devices, such as elevator  trim tabs and adjustable horizontal stabilizers, are used to  counteract the moments set up by fuel burnoff and loading  or off-loading of passengers or cargo.  

# Aircraft Design Characteristics  

Each aircraft handles somewhat differently because each  resists or responds to control pressures in its own way. For  example, a training aircraft is quick to respond to control  applications, while a transport aircraft feels heavy on the  controls and responds to control pressures more slowly.  These features can be designed into an aircraft to facilitate  the particular purpose of the aircraft by considering certain  stability and maneuvering requirements. The following  discussion summarizes the more important aspects of an  aircraft’s stability, maneuverability, and controllability  qualities; how they are analyzed; and their relationship to  various flight conditions.  

# Stability  

Stability is the inherent quality of an aircraft to correct for  conditions that may disturb its equilibrium and to return to  or to continue on the original flight path. It is primarily an  aircraft design characteristic. The flight paths and attitudes an  aircraft flies are limited by the aerodynamic characteristics of  the aircraft, its propulsion system, and its structural strength.  These limitations indicate the maximum performance and  maneuverability of the aircraft. If the aircraft is to provide  maximum utility, it must be safely controllable to the full  extent of these limits without exceeding the pilot’s strength  or requiring exceptional flying ability. If an aircraft is to fly  straight and steady along any arbitrary flight path, the forces  acting on it must be in static equilibrium. The reaction of  any body when its equilibrium is disturbed is referred to as  stability. The two types of stability are static and dynamic.  

# Static Stability  

Static stability refers to the initial tendency, or direction of  movement, back to equilibrium. In aviation, it refers to the  aircraft’s initial response when disturbed from a given pitch,  yaw, or bank.  

•	 Positive static stability—the initial tendency of the  aircraft to return to the original state of equilibrium  after being disturbed.  [Figure 5-21]  •	 Neutral static stability—the initial tendency of  the aircraft to remain in a new condition after its  equilibrium has been disturbed.  [Figure 5-21] •	 Negative static stability—the initial tendency of the  aircraft to continue away from the original state of  equilibrium after being disturbed.  [Figure 5-21]  

# Dynamic Stability  

Static stability has been defined as the initial tendency to  return to equilibrium that the aircraft displays after being  disturbed from its trimmed condition. Occasionally, the  initial tendency is different or opposite from the overall  tendency, so a distinction must be made between the two.  Dynamic stability refers to the aircraft response over time  

![](images/4009b1e22d2c0ad2e69f93dc4721d361237da784b098ee74da28de40d982c492.jpg)  
Figure 5-21.  Types of static stability.  

when disturbed from a given pitch, yaw, or bank. This type  of stability also has three subtypes:  [Figure 5-22]  

•	 Positive dynamic stability—over time, the motion  of the displaced object decreases in amplitude and,  because it is positive, the object displaced returns  toward the equilibrium state. •	 Neutral dynamic stability—once displaced, the  displaced object neither decreases nor increases in  amplitude. A worn automobile shock absorber exhibits  this tendency. •	 Negative dynamic stability—over time, the motion  of the displaced object increases and becomes more  divergent.  

Stability in an aircraft affects two areas significantly:  

•	 Maneuverability—the quality of an aircraft that  permits it to be maneuvered easily and to withstand  the stresses imposed by maneuvers. It is governed by  the aircraft’s weight, inertia, size and location of flight  controls, structural strength, and powerplant. It too is  an aircraft design characteristic. • 	 Controllability—the capability of an aircraft to  respond to the pilot’s control, especially with regard  to flight path and attitude. It is the quality of the  aircraft’s response to the pilot’s control application  when maneuvering the aircraft, regardless of its  stability characteristics.  

# Longitudinal Stability (Pitching)  

In designing an aircraft, a great deal of effort is spent in  developing the desired degree of stability around all three  axes. But longitudinal stability about the lateral axis is  considered to be the most affected by certain variables in  various flight conditions.  

Longitudinal stability is the quality that makes an aircraft  stable about its lateral axis. It involves the pitching motion  as the aircraft’s nose moves up and down in flight. A  longitudinally unstable aircraft has a tendency to dive or  climb progressively into a very steep dive or climb, or even  a stall. Thus, an aircraft with longitudinal instability becomes  difficult and sometimes dangerous to fly.  

Static longitudinal stability, or instability in an aircraft, is  dependent upon three factors:  

1.	 Location of the wing with respect to the CG 2.	 Location of the horizontal tail surfaces with respect  to the CG 3.	 Area or size of the tail surfaces  

In analyzing stability, it should be recalled that a body free  to rotate always turns about its CG.  

To obtain static longitudinal stability, the relation of the  wing and tail moments must be such that, if the moments  are initially balanced and the aircraft is suddenly nose up,  the wing moments and tail moments change so that the sum  of their forces provides an unbalanced but restoring moment  which, in turn, brings the nose down again. Similarly, if the  aircraft is nose down, the resulting change in moments brings  the nose back up.  

The Center of Lift (CL) in most asymmetrical airfoils has a  tendency to change its fore and aft positions with a change in  the AOA. The CL tends to move forward with an increase in  AOA and to move aft with a decrease in AOA. This means  

![](images/ba17b1181b24af94167400f7e4336f76c5d2dbe479fa1bce073038abd1fb0a87.jpg)  
Figure 5-22.  Damped versus undamped stability.  

that when the AOA of an airfoil is increased, the CL, by  moving forward, tends to lift the leading edge of the wing  still more. This tendency gives the wing an inherent quality  of instability. (NOTE: CL is also known as the center of  pressure (CP).)  

Figure 5-23  shows an aircraft in straight-and-level flight. The  line CG-CL-T represents the aircraft’s longitudinal axis from  the CG to a point T on the horizontal stabilizer.  

Most aircraft are designed so that the wing’s CL is to the rear  of the CG. This makes the aircraft “nose heavy” and requires  that there be a slight downward force on the horizontal  stabilizer in order to balance the aircraft and keep the nose  from continually pitching downward. Compensation for this  nose heaviness is provided by setting the horizontal stabilizer  at a slight negative AOA. The downward force thus produced  holds the tail down, counterbalancing the “heavy” nose. It  is as if the line CG-CL-T were a lever with an upward force  at CL and two downward forces balancing each other, one  a strong force at the CG point and the other, a much lesser  force, at point T (downward air pressure on the stabilizer).  To better visualize this physics principle: If an iron bar were  suspended at point CL, with a heavy weight hanging on it at  the CG, it would take downward pressure at point T to keep  the “lever” in balance.  

Even though the horizontal stabilizer may be level when the  aircraft is in level flight, there is a downwash of air from the  wings. This downwash strikes the top of the stabilizer and  produces a downward pressure, which at a certain speed is  just enough to balance the “lever.” The faster the aircraft  is flying, the greater this downwash and the greater the  downward force on the horizontal stabilizer (except T-tails).  [Figure 5-24]  In aircraft with fixed-position horizontal  stabilizers, the aircraft manufacturer sets the stabilizer at an  angle that provides the best stability (or balance) during flight  at the design cruising speed and power setting.  

If the aircraft’s speed decreases, the speed of the airflow  over the wing is decreased. As a result of this decreased

flow of air over the wing, the downwash is reduced, causing  a lesser downward force on the horizontal stabilizer. In turn,  the characteristic nose heaviness is accentuated, causing the  aircraft’s nose to pitch down more.  [Figure 5-25]  This places  the aircraft in a nose-low attitude, lessening the wing’s AOA  and drag and allowing the airspeed to increase. As the aircraft  continues in the nose-low attitude and its speed increases,  the downward force on the horizontal stabilizer is once again  increased. Consequently, the tail is again pushed downward  and the nose rises into a climbing attitude.  

![](images/b32541a5f9df498755a7983483743bc8487b86eec3a2cccd1db438aa7888e781.jpg)  
Figure 5-25.  Reduced power allows pitch down.  

As this climb continues, the airspeed again decreases, causing  the downward force on the tail to decrease until the nose  lowers once more. Because the aircraft is dynamically stable,  the nose does not lower as far this time as it did before. The  aircraft acquires enough speed in this more gradual dive to  start it into another climb, but the climb is not as steep as  the preceding one.  

After several of these diminishing oscillations, in which  the nose alternately rises and lowers, the aircraft finally  settles down to a speed at which the downward force on the  tail exactly counteracts the tendency of the aircraft to dive.  When this condition is attained, the aircraft is once again in  balanced flight and continues in stabilized flight as long as  this attitude and airspeed are not changed.  

A similar effect is noted upon closing the throttle. The  downwash of the wings is reduced and the force at   $\mathrm{T}$   in  Figure 5-23  is not enough to hold the horizontal stabilizer  down. It seems as if the force at T on the lever were allowing  the force of gravity to pull the nose down. This is a desirable  characteristic because the aircraft is inherently trying to  regain airspeed and reestablish the proper balance.  

Power or thrust can also have a destabilizing effect in that  an increase of power may tend to make the nose rise. The  aircraft designer can offset this by establishing a “high  thrust line” wherein the line of thrust passes above the CG.  [Figures 5-26  and  5-27]  In this case, as power or thrust is

increased a moment is produced to counteract the down load  on the tail. On the other hand, a very “low thrust line” would  tend to add to the nose-up effect of the horizontal tail surface. Conclusion: with CG forward of the CL and with an  aerodynamic tail-down force, the aircraft usually tries to  return to a safe flying attitude.  

The following is a simple demonstration of longitudinal  stability. Trim the aircraft for “hands off” control in level  flight. Then, momentarily give the controls a slight push to  nose the aircraft down. If, within a brief period, the nose rises  towards the original position, the aircraft is statically stable.  Ordinarily, the nose passes the original position (that of level  flight) and a series of slow pitching oscillations follows. If the  oscillations gradually cease, the aircraft has positive stability;  if they continue unevenly, the aircraft has neutral stability;  if they increase, the aircraft is unstable.  

# Lateral Stability (Rolling)  

Stability about the aircraft’s longitudinal axis, which extends  from the nose of the aircraft to its tail, is called lateral  stability. Positive lateral stability helps to stabilize the lateral  or “rolling effect” when one wing gets lower than the wing  on the opposite side of the aircraft. There are four main  design factors that make an aircraft laterally stable: dihedral,  sweepback, keel effect, and weight distribution.  

Dihedral  

Some aircraft are designed so that the outer tips of the wings  are higher than the wing roots. The upward angle thus formed  by the wings is called dihedral.  [Figure 5-28]  When a gust  causes a roll, a sideslip will result. This sideslip causes the  relative wind affecting the entire airplane to be from the  direction of the slip. When the relative wind comes from the  side, the wing slipping into the wind is subject to an increase  in AOA and develops an increase in lift. The wing away  from the wind is subject to a decrease in angle of attack, and  develops a decrease in lift. The changes in lift effect a rolling  moment tending to raise the windward wing, hence dihedral  contributes to a stable roll due to sideslip.  [Figure 5-29]  

Sweepback and Wing Location  

Many aspects of an aircraft's configuration can affect its  effective dihedral, but two major components are wing  sweepback and the wing location with respect to the fuselage  (such as a low wing or high wing). As a rough estimation,   $10^{\circ}$   of sweepback on a wing provides about   $1^{\circ}$   of effective  dihedral, while a high wing configuration can provide about   $5^{\circ}$   of effective dihedral over a low wing configuration.  

A sweptback wing is one in which the leading edge slopes  backward.  [Figure 5-30]  When a disturbance causes an  aircraft with sweepback to slip or drop a wing, the low  wing presents its leading edge at an angle that is more  perpendicular to the relative airflow. As a result, the low  wing acquires more lift, rises, and the aircraft is restored to  its original flight attitude.  

# Keel Effect and Weight Distribution  

A high wing aircraft always has the tendency to turn the  longitudinal axis of the aircraft into the relative wind, which  is often referred to as the keel effect. These aircraft are  laterally stable simply because the wings are attached in a  high position on the fuselage, making the fuselage behave like  a keel exerting a steadying influence on the aircraft laterally  about the longitudinal axis. When a high-winged aircraft is  

![](images/7a5373390676406697da0beff2645b0324b40ca9bf8e3aee1193f789ddc4051f.jpg)

disturbed and one wing dips, the fuselage weight acts like a  pendulum returning the aircraft to the horizontal level.  

Laterally stable aircraft are constructed so that the greater  portion of the keel area is above the CG.  [Figure 5-31]  Thus,  when the aircraft slips to one side, the combination of the  

![](images/ff3afe1c99aacb54438d1a2594c870639826da9a8e1ce698885f9b9ccfb4d360.jpg)

Figure 5-31.  Keel area for lateral stability.  

aircraft’s weight and the pressure of the airflow against the  upper portion of the keel area (both acting about the CG)  tends to roll the aircraft back to wings-level flight.  

# Directional Stability (Yawing)  

Stability about the aircraft’s vertical axis (the sideways  moment) is called yawing or directional stability. Yawing  or directional stability is the most easily achieved stability  in aircraft design. The area of the vertical fin and the sides  of the fuselage aft of the CG are the prime contributors that  make the aircraft act like the well known weather vane or  arrow, pointing its nose into the relative wind.  

In examining a weather vane, it can be seen that if exactly the  same amount of surface were exposed to the wind in front  of the pivot point as behind it, the forces fore and aft would  be in balance and little or no directional movement would  result. Consequently, it is necessary to have a greater surface  aft of the pivot point than forward of it.  

Similarly, the aircraft designer must ensure positive  directional stability by making the side surface greater aft  than ahead of the CG.  [Figure 5-32]  To provide additional  positive stability to that provided by the fuselage, a vertical  fin is added. The fin acts similar to the feather on an arrow  in maintaining straight flight. Like the weather vane and the  arrow, the farther aft this fin is placed and the larger its size,  the greater the aircraft’s directional stability.  

If an aircraft is flying in a straight line, and a sideward gust  of air gives the aircraft a slight rotation about its vertical  axis (i.e., the right), the motion is retarded and stopped by  the fin because while the aircraft is rotating to the right, the  air is striking the left side of the fin at an angle. This causes  pressure on the left side of the fin, which resists the turning  motion and slows down the aircraft’s yaw. In doing so, it  acts somewhat like the weather vane by turning the aircraft  into the relative wind. The initial change in direction of the  aircraft’s flight path is generally slightly behind its change  of heading. Therefore, after a slight yawing of the aircraft  

![](images/69bb7255da99940a04a131c0441e0b6d3748b2715a33857b1fe007a727e808a9.jpg)  
Figure 5-32.  Fuselage and fin for directional stability.  

to the right, there is a brief moment when the aircraft is still  moving along its original path, but its longitudinal axis is  pointed slightly to the right.  

The aircraft is then momentarily skidding sideways and,  during that moment (since it is assumed that although the  yawing motion has stopped, the excess pressure on the left  side of the fin still persists), there is necessarily a tendency  for the aircraft to be turned partially back to the left. That is,  there is a momentary restoring tendency caused by the fin.  

This restoring tendency is relatively slow in developing and  ceases when the aircraft stops skidding. When it ceases, the  aircraft is flying in a direction slightly different from the  original direction. In other words, it will not return of its own  accord to the original heading; the pilot must reestablish the  initial heading.  

A minor improvement of directional stability may be obtained  through sweepback. Sweepback is incorporated in the design  of the wing primarily to delay the onset of compressibility  during high-speed flight. In lighter and slower aircraft,  sweepback aids in locating the center of pressure in the  correct relationship with the CG. A longitudinally stable  aircraft is built with the center of pressure aft of the CG.  

Because of structural reasons, aircraft designers sometimes  cannot attach the wings to the fuselage at the exact desired  point. If they had to mount the wings too far forward, and at  right angles to the fuselage, the center of pressure would not  be far enough to the rear to result in the desired amount of  longitudinal stability. By building sweepback into the wings,  however, the designers can move the center of pressure toward  the rear. The amount of sweepback and the position of the  wings then place the center of pressure in the correct location.  

When turbulence or rudder application causes the aircraft to  yaw to one side, the opposite wing presents a longer leading  edge perpendicular to the relative airflow. The airspeed of  the forward wing increases and it acquires more drag than  the back wing. The additional drag on the forward wing pulls  the wing back, turning the aircraft back to its original path.  

The contribution of the wing to static directional stability is  usually small. The swept wing provides a stable contribution  depending on the amount of sweepback, but the contribution  is relatively small when compared with other components.  

# Free Directional Oscillations (Dutch Roll)  

Dutch roll is a coupled lateral/directional oscillation that is  usually dynamically stable but is unsafe in an aircraft because  of the oscillatory nature. The damping of the oscillatory mode  may be weak or strong depending on the properties of the  particular aircraft.  

If the aircraft has a right wing pushed down, the positive  sideslip angle corrects the wing laterally before the nose is  realigned with the relative wind. As the wing corrects the  position, a lateral directional oscillation can occur resulting in  the nose of the aircraft making a figure eight on the horizon as  a result of two oscillations (roll and yaw), which, although of  about the same magnitude, are out of phase with each other.  

In most modern aircraft, except high-speed swept wing  designs, these free directional oscillations usually die out  automatically in very few cycles unless the air continues to  be gusty or turbulent. Those aircraft with continuing Dutch  roll tendencies are usually equipped with gyro-stabilized yaw  dampers. Manufacturers try to reach a midpoint between too  much and too little directional stability. Because it is more  desirable for the aircraft to have “spiral instability” than  Dutch roll tendencies, most aircraft are designed with that  characteristic.  

# Spiral Instability  

Spiral instability exists when the static directional stability  of the aircraft is very strong as compared to the effect of its  dihedral in maintaining lateral equilibrium. When the lateral  equilibrium of the aircraft is disturbed by a gust of air and a  sideslip is introduced, the strong directional stability tends  to yaw the nose into the resultant relative wind while the  comparatively weak dihedral lags in restoring the lateral  balance. Due to this yaw, the wing on the outside of the  turning moment travels forward faster than the inside wing  and, as a consequence, its lift becomes greater. This produces  an overbanking tendency which, if not corrected by the pilot,  results in the bank angle becoming steeper and steeper. At  the same time, the strong directional stability that yaws the  aircraft into the relative wind is actually forcing the nose  to a lower pitch attitude. A slow downward spiral begins  which, if not counteracted by the pilot, gradually increases  into a steep spiral dive. Usually the rate of divergence in the  spiral motion is so gradual the pilot can control the tendency  without any difficulty.  

Many aircraft are affected to some degree by this characteristic,  although they may be inherently stable in all other normal  parameters. This tendency explains why an aircraft cannot  be flown “hands off” indefinitely.  

Much research has gone into the development of control  devices (wing leveler) to correct or eliminate this instability.  The pilot must be careful in application of recovery controls  during advanced stages of this spiral condition or excessive  loads may be imposed on the structure. Improper recovery  from spiral instability leading to inflight structural failures  has probably contributed to more fatalities in general aviation  aircraft than any other factor. Since the airspeed in the spiral  condition builds up rapidly, the application of back elevator  force to reduce this speed and to pull the nose up only  “tightens the turn,” increasing the load factor. The results  of the prolonged uncontrolled spiral are inflight structural  failure, crashing into the ground, or both. Common recorded  causes for pilots who get into this situation are loss of horizon  reference, inability to control the aircraft by reference to  instruments, or a combination of both.  

# Effect of Wing Planform  

Understanding the effects of different wing planforms  is important when learning about wing performance and  airplane flight characteristics. A planform is the shape of the  wing as viewed from directly above and deals with airflow  in three dimensions. Aspect ratio, taper ratio, and sweepback  are factors in planform design that are very important to the  overall aerodynamic characteristic of a wing.  [Figure 5-33]  

Aspect ratio is the ratio of wing span to wing chord. Taper  ratio can be either in planform or thickness, or both. In its  simplest terms, it is a decrease from wing root to wingtip in  wing chord or wing thickness. Sweepback is the rearward  slant of a wing, horizontal tail, or other airfoil surface.  

There are two general means by which the designer can  change the planform of a wing and both will affect the  

![](images/108e80a89c98e1fbbfde52409bd10a79c27387a0d1d31806ff5014fa4e14ad76.jpg)  
Figure 5-33.  Different types of wing planforms.  

aerodynamic characteristics of the wing. The first is to effect  a change in the aspect ratio. Aspect ratio is the primary factor  in determining the three dimensional characteristics of the  ordinary wing and its lift/drag ratio. An increase in aspect  ratio with constant velocity will decrease the drag, especially  at high angles of attack, improving the performance of the  wing when in a climbing attitude.  

A decrease in aspect ratio will give a corresponding increase  in drag. It should be noted, however, that with an increase in  aspect ratio there is an increase in the length of span, with a  corresponding increase in the weight of the wing structure,  which means the wing must be heavier to carry the same load.  For this reason, part of the gain (due to a decrease in drag) is  lost because of the increased weight, and a compromise in  design is necessary to obtain the best results from these two  conflicting conditions.  

The second means of changing the planform is by tapering  (decreasing the length of chord from the root to the tip of the  wing). In general, tapering causes a decrease in drag (most  effective at high speeds) and an increase in lift. There is also  a structural benefit due to a saving in weight of the wing.  

Most training and general aviation type airplanes are operated  at high coefficients of lift, and therefore require comparatively  high aspect ratios. Airplanes that are developed to operate at  very high speeds demand greater aerodynamic cleanness and  greater strength, which require low aspect ratios. Very low  aspect ratios result in high wing loadings and high stall speeds.  When sweepback is combined with low aspect ratio, it results  in flying qualities very different from a more conventional  high aspect ratio airplane configuration. Such airplanes  require very precise and professional flying techniques,  especially at slow speeds, while airplanes with a high aspect  ratio are usually more forgiving of improper pilot techniques.  

The elliptical wing is the ideal subsonic planform since it  provides for a minimum of induced drag for a given aspect  ratio, though as we shall see, its stall characteristics in  some respects are inferior to the rectangular wing. It is also  comparatively difficult to construct. The tapered airfoil is  desirable from the standpoint of weight and stiffness, but  again is not as efficient aerodynamically as the elliptical  wing. In order to preserve the aerodynamic efficiency of the  elliptical wing, rectangular and tapered wings are sometimes  tailored through use of wing twist and variation in airfoil  sections until they provide as nearly as possible the elliptical  wing’s lift distribution. While it is true that the elliptical  wing provides the best coefficients of lift before reaching an  incipient stall, it gives little advance warning of a complete  stall, and lateral control may be difficult because of poor  aileron effectiveness.  

In comparison, the rectangular wing has a tendency to stall  first at the wing root and provides adequate stall warning,  adequate aileron effectiveness, and is usually quite stable.  It is, therefore, favored in the design of low cost, low speed  airplanes.  

# Aerodynamic Forces in Flight Maneuvers  

# Forces in Turns  

If an aircraft were viewed in straight-and-level flight from the  front  [Figure 5-34],  and if the forces acting on the aircraft  could be seen, lift and weight would be apparent: two forces.  If the aircraft were in a bank it would be apparent that lift  did not act directly opposite to the weight, rather it now acts  in the direction of the bank. A basic truth about turns is that  when the aircraft banks, lift acts inward toward the center of  the turn, perpendicular to the lateral axis as well as upward.  

Newton’s First Law of Motion, the Law of Inertia, states that  an object at rest or moving in a straight line remains at rest  or continues to move in a straight line until acted on by some  other force. An aircraft, like any moving object, requires a  sideward force to make it turn. In a normal turn, this force  is supplied by banking the aircraft so that lift is exerted  inward, as well as upward. The force of lift during a turn is  separated into two components at right angles to each other.  One component, which acts vertically and opposite to the  weight (gravity), is called the “vertical component of lift.”  The other, which acts horizontally toward the center of the  turn, is called the “horizontal component of lift” or centripetal  force. The horizontal component of lift is the force that  pulls the aircraft from a straight flight path to make it turn.  Centrifugal force is the “equal and opposite reaction” of the  aircraft to the change in direction and acts equal and opposite  to the horizontal component of lift. This explains why, in a  correctly executed turn, the force that turns the aircraft is  not supplied by the rudder. The rudder is used to correct any  deviation between the straight track of the nose and tail of the  aircraft into the relative wind. A good turn is one in which the  

![](images/65412b07a6ad417984bf9c8cdff0c10e7225251788e435216ffeb1b1e41d81a0.jpg)  
Figure 5-34.  Forces during normal, coordinated turn at constant altitude.  

nose and tail of the aircraft track along the same path. If no  rudder is used in a turn, the nose of the aircraft yaws to the  outside of the turn. The rudder is used rolling into the turn  to bring the nose back in line with the relative wind. Once  in the turn, the rudder should not be needed.  

An aircraft is not steered like a boat or an automobile. In  order for an aircraft to turn, it must be banked. If it is not  banked, there is no force available to cause it to deviate  from a straight flight path. Conversely, when an aircraft is  banked, it turns provided it is not slipping to the inside of the  turn. Good directional control is based on the fact that the  aircraft attempts to turn whenever it is banked. Pilots should  keep this fact in mind when attempting to hold the aircraft  in straight-and-level flight.  

Merely banking the aircraft into a turn produces no change in  the total amount of lift developed. Since the lift during the bank  is divided into vertical and horizontal components, the amount  of lift opposing gravity and supporting the aircraft’s weight  is reduced. Consequently, the aircraft loses altitude unless  additional lift is created. This is done by increasing the AOA  until the vertical component of lift is again equal to the weight.  Since the vertical component of lift decreases as the bank  angle increases, the AOA must be progressively increased  to produce sufficient vertical lift to support the aircraft’s  weight. An important fact for pilots to remember when making  constant altitude turns is that the vertical component of lift  must be equal to the weight to maintain altitude.  

At a given airspeed, the rate at which an aircraft turns  depends upon the magnitude of the horizontal component  of lift. It is found that the horizontal component of lift is  proportional to the angle of bank—that is, it increases or  decreases respectively as the angle of bank increases or  decreases. As the angle of bank is increased, the horizontal  component of lift increases, thereby increasing the rate of  turn (ROT). Consequently, at any given airspeed, the ROT  can be controlled by adjusting the angle of bank.  

To provide a vertical component of lift sufficient to hold  altitude in a level turn, an increase in the AOA is required.  Since the drag of the airfoil is directly proportional to its AOA,  induced drag increases as the lift is increased. This, in turn,  causes a loss of airspeed in proportion to the angle of bank.  A small angle of bank results in a small reduction in airspeed  while a large angle of bank results in a large reduction in  airspeed. Additional thrust (power) must be applied to prevent  a reduction in airspeed in level turns. The required amount of  additional thrust is proportional to the angle of bank.  

To compensate for added lift, which would result if the  airspeed were increased during a turn, the AOA must be  decreased, or the angle of bank increased, if a constant  altitude is to be maintained. If the angle of bank is held  constant and the AOA decreased, the ROT decreases. In order  to maintain a constant ROT as the airspeed is increased, the  AOA must remain constant and the angle of bank increased.  

An increase in airspeed results in an increase of the turn radius,  and centrifugal force is directly proportional to the radius of  the turn. In a correctly executed turn, the horizontal component  of lift must be exactly equal and opposite to the centrifugal  force. As the airspeed is increased in a constant-rate level turn,  the radius of the turn increases. This increase in the radius of  turn causes an increase in the centrifugal force, which must  be balanced by an increase in the horizontal component of lift,  which can only be increased by increasing the angle of bank.  

In a slipping turn, the aircraft is not turning at the rate  appropriate to the bank being used, since the aircraft is yawed  toward the outside of the turning flight path. The aircraft is  banked too much for the ROT, so the horizontal lift component  is greater than the centrifugal force.  [Figure 5-35]  Equilibrium  between the horizontal lift component and centrifugal force  is reestablished by either decreasing the bank, increasing the  ROT, or a combination of the two changes.  

A skidding turn results from an excess of centrifugal force  over the horizontal lift component, pulling the aircraft  toward the outside of the turn. The ROT is too great for the  angle of bank. Correction of a skidding turn thus involves a  reduction in the ROT, an increase in bank, or a combination  of the two changes.  

To maintain a given ROT, the angle of bank must be varied  with the airspeed. This becomes particularly important in  high-speed aircraft. For instance, at 400 miles per hour (mph),  an aircraft must be banked approximately   $44^{\circ}$   to execute a  standard-rate turn (  $3^{\circ}$   per second). At this angle of bank,  only about 79 percent of the lift of the aircraft comprises the  vertical component of the lift. This causes a loss of altitude  unless the AOA is increased sufficiently to compensate for  the loss of vertical lift.  

# Forces in Climbs  

For all practical purposes, the wing’s lift in a steady state  normal climb is the same as it is in a steady level flight at the  same airspeed. Although the aircraft’s flight path changed  when the climb was established, the AOA of the wing with  respect to the inclined flight path reverts to practically the  same values, as does the lift. There is an initial momentary  change as shown in  Figure 5-36.  During the transition from  straight-and-level flight to a climb, a change in lift occurs  when back elevator pressure is first applied. Raising the  aircraft’s nose increases the AOA and momentarily increases  

![](images/0cab500ab04053d8f23471ccb51abda87df80c98533463aad8243e982c790c82.jpg)  
Figure 5-35.  Normal, slipping, and skidding turns at a constant altitude.  

the lift. Lift at this moment is now greater than weight and  starts the aircraft climbing. After the flight path is stabilized  on the upward incline, the AOA and lift again revert to about  the level flight values.  

If the climb is entered with no change in power setting, the  airspeed gradually diminishes because the thrust required  to maintain a given airspeed in level flight is insufficient to  maintain the same airspeed in a climb. When the flight path  is inclined upward, a component of the aircraft’s weight  acts in the same direction as, and parallel to, the total drag  of the aircraft, thereby increasing the total effective drag.  Consequently, the total effective drag is greater than the  power, and the airspeed decreases. The reduction in airspeed  gradually results in a corresponding decrease in drag until  the total drag (including the component of weight acting  in the same direction) equals the thrust.  [Figure 5-37]  Due  to momentum, the change in airspeed is gradual, varying  considerably with differences in aircraft size, weight, total  drag, and other factors. Consequently, the total effective drag  is greater than the thrust, and the airspeed decreases.  

Generally, the forces of thrust and drag, and lift and weight,  again become balanced when the airspeed stabilizes but at  

![](images/2fbfd61d5b049c7df1ba67ba8f6b7ee50889b0f3353b5518e0519c3a3dc4985c.jpg)  
Figure 5-36.  Changes in lift during climb entry.  

a value lower than in straight-and-level flight at the same  power setting. Since the aircraft’s weight is acting not only  downward but rearward with drag while in a climb, additional  power is required to maintain the same airspeed as in level  flight. The amount of power depends on the angle of climb.  When the climb is established steep enough that there is  insufficient power available, a slower speed results.  

The thrust required for a stabilized climb equals drag plus a  percentage of weight dependent on the angle of climb. For  example, a   $10^{\circ}$   climb would require thrust to equal drag plus  17 percent of weight. To climb straight up would require  thrust to equal all of weight and drag. Therefore, the angle  of climb for climb performance is dependent on the amount  of excess thrust available to overcome a portion of weight.  Note that aircraft are able to sustain a climb due to excess  thrust. When the excess thrust is gone, the aircraft is no  longer able to climb. At this point, the aircraft has reached  its “absolute ceiling.”  

# Forces in Descents  

As in climbs, the forces that act on the aircraft go through  definite changes when a descent is entered from straight- and-level flight. For the following example, the aircraft  

![](images/005e2a2f0a159234a886c14aa1593de1498bab17c91ba592418e1e48db376d0d.jpg)  
Figure 5-37.  Changes in speed during climb entry.  

is descending at the same power as used in straight-and-
 level flight.  

As forward pressure is applied to the control yoke to initiate  the descent, the AOA is decreased momentarily. Initially,  the momentum of the aircraft causes the aircraft to briefly  continue along the same flight path. For this instant, the AOA  decreases causing the total lift to decrease. With weight now  being greater than lift, the aircraft begins to descend. At the  same time, the flight path goes from level to a descending  flight path. Do not confuse a reduction in lift with the inability  to generate sufficient lift to maintain level flight. The flight  path is being manipulated with available thrust in reserve  and with the elevator.  

To descend at the same airspeed as used in straight-and- level flight, the power must be reduced as the descent is  entered. Entering the descent, the component of weight  acting forward along the flight path increases as the angle  of descent increases and, conversely, when leveling off, the  component of weight acting along the flight path decreases  as the angle of descent decreases.  

# Stalls  

An aircraft stall results from a rapid decrease in lift caused by  the separation of airflow from the wing’s surface brought on  by exceeding the critical AOA. A stall can occur at any pitch  attitude or airspeed. Stalls are one of the most misunderstood  areas of aerodynamics because pilots often believe an airfoil  stops producing lift when it stalls. In a stall, the wing does  not totally stop producing lift. Rather, it cannot generate  adequate lift to sustain level flight.  

Since the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}}$   increases with an increase in AOA, at some  point the  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   peaks and then begins to drop off. This peak is  called the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}}$  . The amount of lift the wing produces drops  dramatically after exceeding the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}}$   or critical AOA, but  as stated above, it does not completely stop producing lift.  

In most straight-wing aircraft, the wing is designed to stall  the wing root first. The wing root reaches its critical AOA  first making the stall progress outward toward the wingtip.  By having the wing root stall first, aileron effectiveness is  maintained at the wingtips, maintaining controllability of  the aircraft. Various design methods are used to achieve  the stalling of the wing root first. In one design, the wing is  “twisted” to a higher AOA at the wing root. Installing stall  strips on the first 20–25 percent of the wing’s leading edge  is another method to introduce a stall prematurely.  

The wing never completely stops producing lift in a stalled  condition. If it did, the aircraft would fall to the Earth. Most  training aircraft are designed for the nose of the aircraft to  drop during a stall, reducing the AOA and “unstalling” the  wing. The nose-down tendency is due to the CL being aft of  the CG. The CG range is very important when it comes to  stall recovery characteristics. If an aircraft is allowed to be  operated outside of the CG range, the pilot may have difficulty  recovering from a stall. The most critical CG violation would  occur when operating with a CG that exceeds the rear limit.  In this situation, a pilot may not be able to generate sufficient  force with the elevator to counteract the excess weight aft of  the CG. Without the ability to decrease the AOA, the aircraft  continues in a stalled condition until it contacts the ground.  

The stalling speed of a particular aircraft is not a fixed value  for all flight situations, but a given aircraft always stalls at  the same AOA regardless of airspeed, weight, load factor, or  density altitude. Each aircraft has a particular AOA where the  airflow separates from the upper surface of the wing and the  stall occurs. This critical AOA varies from approximately  $16^{\circ}$  to  $20^{\circ}$   depending on the aircraft’s design. But each aircraft  has only one specific AOA where the stall occurs.  

There are three flight situations in which the critical AOA is  most frequently exceeded: low speed, high speed, and turning.  

One way the aircraft can be stalled in straight-and-level flight  by flying too slowly. As the airspeed decreases, the AOA  must be increased to retain the lift required for maintaining  altitude. The lower the airspeed becomes, the more the AOA  must be increased. Eventually, an AOA is reached that results  in the wing not producing enough lift to support the aircraft,  which then starts settling. If the airspeed is reduced further,  the aircraft stalls because the AOA has exceeded the critical  angle and the airflow over the wing is disrupted.  

Low speed is not necessary to produce a stall. The wing  can be brought into an excessive AOA at any speed. For  example, an aircraft is in a dive with an airspeed of 100  knots when the pilot pulls back sharply on the elevator  control.  [Figure 5-38]  Gravity and centrifugal force prevent  an immediate alteration of the flight path, but the aircraft’s  AOA changes abruptly from quite low to very high. Since  the flight path of the aircraft in relation to the oncoming air  determines the direction of the relative wind, the AOA is  suddenly increased, and the aircraft would reach the stalling  angle at a speed much greater than the normal stall speed.  

The stalling speed of an aircraft is also higher in a level turn  than in straight-and-level flight.  [Figure 5-39]  Centrifugal  force is added to the aircraft’s weight and the wing must  produce sufficient additional lift to counterbalance the load  imposed by the combination of centrifugal force and weight.  In a turn, the necessary additional lift is acquired by applying  back pressure to the elevator control. This increases the wing’s

AOA and results in increased lift. The AOA must increase  as the bank angle increases to counteract the increasing load  caused by centrifugal force. If at any time during a turn the  AOA becomes excessive, the aircraft stalls.  

At this point, the action of the aircraft during a stall should be  examined. To balance the aircraft aerodynamically, the CL  is normally located aft of the CG. Although this makes the  aircraft inherently nose-heavy, downwash on the horizontal  stabilizer counteracts this condition. At the point of stall,  when the upward force of the wing’s lift diminishes below  that required for sustained flight and the downward tail  force decreases to a point of ineffectiveness, or causes it to  have an upward force, an unbalanced condition exists. This  causes the aircraft to pitch down abruptly, rotating about its  CG. During this nose-down attitude, the AOA decreases and  the airspeed again increases. The smooth flow of air over  the wing begins again, lift returns, and the aircraft begins  to fly again. Considerable altitude may be lost before this  cycle is complete.  

![](images/5c504e818e7e9bc4a4e76611b35739a76aff09d45b90b0582a6dc4d3ace8f16d.jpg)  
Figure 5-39.  Increase in stall speed and load factor.  

Airfoil shape and degradation of that shape must also be  considered in a discussion of stalls. For example, if ice, snow,  and frost are allowed to accumulate on the surface of an aircraft,  the smooth airflow over the wing is disrupted. This causes the  boundary layer to separate at an AOA lower than that of the  critical angle. Lift is greatly reduced, altering expected aircraft  performance. If ice is allowed to accumulate on the aircraft  during flight ,  the weight of the aircraft is increased while the  ability to generate lift is decreased.  [Figure 5-40]  As little as  0.8 millimeter of ice on the upper wing surface increases drag  and reduces aircraft lift by 25 percent.  

Pilots can encounter icing in any season, anywhere in the  country, at altitudes of up to 18,000 feet and sometimes  higher. Small aircraft, including commuter planes, are most  vulnerable because they fly at lower altitudes where ice is more  prevalent. They also lack mechanisms common on jet aircraft  that prevent ice buildup by heating the front edges of wings.  

Icing can occur in clouds any time the temperature drops  below freezing and super-cooled droplets build up on an  aircraft and freeze. (Super-cooled droplets are still liquid  even though the temperature is below 32 °Fahrenheit (F),  or  $0~^{\circ}$  Celsius (C).  

# Angle of Attack Indicators  

The FAA along with the General Aviation Joint Steering  Committee (GAJSC) is promoting AOA indicators as one  of the many safety initiatives aimed at reducing the general  aviation accident rate. AOA indicators will specifically target  Loss of Control (LOC) accidents. Loss of control is the  number one root cause of fatalities in both general aviation  and commercial aviation. More than 25 percent of general  aviation fatal accidents occur during the maneuvering phase  of flight. Of those accidents, half involve stall/spin scenarios.  Technology such as AOA indicators can have a tremendous  impact on reversing this trend and are increasingly affordable  for general aviation airplanes.  [Figure 5-41]  

The purpose of an AOA indicator is to give the pilot better  situation awareness pertaining to the aerodynamic health  

![](images/63feb071c297354d32bf8873a0dfb79197519b0c6022af9d0680fc096bbe3f0a.jpg)  
Figure 5-40.  Inflight ice formation.  

of the airfoil. This can also be referred to as stall margin  awareness. More simply explained, it is the margin that exists  between the current AOA that the airfoil is operating at, and  the AOA at which the airfoil will stall (critical AOA).  

Angle of attack is taught to student pilots as theory in ground  training. When beginning flight training, students typically  rely solely on airspeed and the published 1G stall speed to  avoid stalls. This creates problems since this speed is only  valid when the following conditions are met:  

• 	 Unaccelerated flight (a 1G load factor) • 	 Coordinated flight (inclinometer centered) • 	 At one weight (typically maximum gross weight)  

Speed by itself is not a reliable parameter to avoid a stall.  An airplane can stall at any speed. Angle of attack is a better  parameter to use to avoid a stall. For a given configuration,  the airplane always stalls at the same AOA, referred to as  the critical AOA. This critical AOA does not change with:  

• 	 Weight • 	 Bank angle • 	 Temperature • 	 Density altitude • 	 Center of gravity  

An AOA indicator can have several benefits when installed  in general aviation aircraft, not the least of which is increased  situational awareness. Without an AOA indicator, the AOA  is “invisible” to pilots. These devices measure several  parameters simultaneously and determine the current AOA  providing a visual image to the pilot of the current AOA along  with representations of the proximity to the critical AOA.  [Figure 5-42]  These devices can give a visual representation  of the energy management state of the airplane. The energy  state of an airplane is the balance between airspeed, altitude,  drag, and thrust and represents how efficiently the airfoil is  operating. The more efficiently the airfoil operates; the larger  stall margin that is present. With this increased situational  awareness pertaining to the energy condition of the airplane,  pilots will have information that they need to aid in preventing  a LOC scenario resulting from a stall/spin. Additionally, the  less energy that is utilized to maintain flight means greater  overall efficiency of the airplane, which is typically realized in  fuel savings. This equates to a lower operating cost to the pilot.  

Just as training is required for any system on an aircraft,  AOA indicators have training considerations also. A more  comprehensive understanding of AOA in general should be  the goal of this training along with the specific operating  characteristics and limitations of the installed AOA indicator.  Ground and flight instructors should make every attempt  to receive training from an instructor knowledgeable about  AOA indicators prior to giving instruction pertaining to or in  airplanes equipped with AOA indicators. Pilot schools should  incorporate training on AOA indicators in their syllabi,  whether their training aircraft are equipped with them or not.  

Installation of AOA indicators not required by type  certification in general aviation airplanes has recently been  streamlined by the FAA. The FAA established policy in  February 2014 pertaining to non-required AOA systems and  how they may be installed as a minor alteration, depending  upon their installation requirements and operational  utilization, and the procedures to take for certification of  these installations. For updated information, reference the  FAA website at www.faa.gov.  

While AOA indicators provide a simple visual representation  of the current AOA and its proximity to the critical AOA, they  are not without their limitations. These limitations should  be understood by operators of general aviation airplanes

equipped with these devices. Like advanced automation,  such as autopilots and moving maps, the misunderstanding  or misuse of the equipment can have disastrous results. Some  items which may limit the effectiveness of an AOA indicator  are listed below:  

• 	 Calibration techniques • 	 Probes or vanes not being heated • 	 The type of indicator itself • 	 Flap setting • 	 Wing contamination  

Pilots of general aviation airplanes equipped with AOA  indicators should contact the manufacturer for specific  limitations applicable to that installation.  

# Basic Propeller Principles  

The aircraft propeller consists of two or more blades and a  central hub to which the blades are attached. Each blade of  an aircraft propeller is essentially a rotating wing. As a result  of their construction, the propeller blades are like airfoils  and produce forces that create the thrust to pull, or push,  the aircraft through the air. The engine furnishes the power  needed to rotate the propeller blades through the air at high  speeds, and the propeller transforms the rotary power of the  engine into forward thrust.  

A cross-section of a typical propeller blade is shown in  Figure 5-43.  This section or blade element is an airfoil  comparable to a cross-section of an aircraft wing. One  surface of the blade is cambered or curved, similar to the  upper surface of an aircraft wing, while the other surface is  flat like the bottom surface of a wing. The chord line is an  imaginary line drawn through the blade from its leading edge  to its trailing edge. As in a wing, the leading edge is the thick  edge of the blade that meets the air as the propeller rotates. Blade angle, usually measured in degrees, is the angle  between the chord of the blade and the plane of rotation  and is measured at a specific point along the length of the  blade.  [Figure 5-44]  Because most propellers have a flat  blade “face,” the chord line is often drawn along the face  of the propeller blade. Pitch is not blade angle, but because  pitch is largely determined by blade angle, the two terms are  

![](images/705d82ac21f27ad92eb0bf8983d079dd19d26dea864ae50e6d3fc507719098b7.jpg)  
Figure 5-43.  Airfoil sections of propeller blade.  

often used interchangeably. An increase or decrease in one is  usually associated with an increase or decrease in the other. The pitch of a propeller may be designated in inches. A  propeller designated as a   $^{\ast74-48^{\ast}}$   would be 74 inches in  length and have an effective pitch of 48 inches. The pitch  is the distance in inches, which the propeller would screw  through the air in one revolution if there were no slippage.  

When specifying a fixed-pitch propeller for a new type of  aircraft, the manufacturer usually selects one with a pitch  that operates efficiently at the expected cruising speed of the  aircraft. Every fixed-pitch propeller must be a compromise  because it can be efficient at only a given combination of  airspeed and revolutions per minute (rpm). Pilots cannot  change this combination in flight.  

When the aircraft is at rest on the ground with the engine  operating, or moving slowly at the beginning of takeoff,  the propeller efficiency is very low because the propeller is  restrained from advancing with sufficient speed to permit  its fixed-pitch blades to reach their full efficiency. In this  situation, each propeller blade is turning through the air at  an AOA that produces relatively little thrust for the amount  of power required to turn it.  

To understand the action of a propeller, consider first its  motion, which is both rotational and forward. As shown by  

![](images/98eceb6bddefba9403da844f911d6cca6804d2a20acd10e6f91e4ce44bc041c1.jpg)  
Figure 5-44.   Propeller blade angle.  

the vectors of propeller forces in  Figure 5-44,  each section of  a propeller blade moves downward and forward. The angle  at which this air (relative wind) strikes the propeller blade  is its AOA. The air deflection produced by this angle causes  the dynamic pressure at the engine side of the propeller blade  to be greater than atmospheric pressure, thus creating thrust.  

The shape of the blade also creates thrust because it is  cambered like the airfoil shape of a wing. As the air flows  past the propeller, the pressure on one side is less than that  on the other. As in a wing, a reaction force is produced in the  direction of the lesser pressure. The airflow over the wing  has less pressure, and the force (lift) is upward. In the case  of the propeller, which is mounted in a vertical instead of a  horizontal plane, the area of decreased pressure is in front of  the propeller, and the force (thrust) is in a forward direction.  Aerodynamically, thrust is the result of the propeller shape  and the AOA of the blade.  

Thrust can be considered also in terms of the mass of air  handled by the propeller. In these terms, thrust equals mass  of air handled multiplied by slipstream velocity minus  velocity of the aircraft. The power expended in producing  thrust depends on the rate of air mass movement. On average,  thrust constitutes approximately 80 percent of the torque (total  horsepower absorbed by the propeller). The other 20 percent  is lost in friction and slippage. For any speed of rotation,  the horsepower absorbed by the propeller balances the  horsepower delivered by the engine. For any single revolution  of the propeller, the amount of air handled depends on the  blade angle, which determines how big a “bite” of air the  propeller takes. Thus, the blade angle is an excellent means of  adjusting the load on the propeller to control the engine rpm.  

The blade angle is also an excellent method of adjusting the  AOA of the propeller. On constant-speed propellers, the blade  angle must be adjusted to provide the most efficient AOA at  all engine and aircraft speeds. Lift versus drag curves, which  are drawn for propellers as well as wings, indicate that the  most efficient AOA is small, varying from  $+2^{\circ}$   to  $+4^{\circ}$  . The  actual blade angle necessary to maintain this small AOA  varies with the forward speed of the aircraft.  

Fixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers are designed  for best efficiency at one rotation and forward speed. They  are designed for a given aircraft and engine combination. A  propeller may be used that provides the maximum efficiency  for takeoff, climb, cruise, or high-speed flight. Any change in  these conditions results in lowering the efficiency of both the  propeller and the engine. Since the efficiency of any machine  is the ratio of the useful power output to the actual power  input, propeller efficiency is the ratio of thrust horsepower  to brake horsepower. Propeller efficiency varies from 50 to  87 percent, depending on how much the propeller “slips.” Propeller slip is the difference between the geometric pitch of  the propeller and its effective pitch.  [Figure 5-45]  Geometric  pitch is the theoretical distance a propeller should advance  in one revolution; effective pitch is the distance it actually  advances. Thus, geometric or theoretical pitch is based on  no slippage, but actual or effective pitch includes propeller  slippage in the air.  

The reason a propeller is “twisted” is that the outer parts of the  propeller blades, like all things that turn about a central point,  travel faster than the portions near the hub.  [Figure 5-46]  If the  blades had the same geometric pitch throughout their lengths,  portions near the hub could have negative AOAs while the  propeller tips would be stalled at cruise speed. Twisting or  variations in the geometric pitch of the blades permits the  propeller to operate with a relatively constant AOA along its  length when in cruising flight. Propeller blades are twisted  to change the blade angle in proportion to the differences in  speed of rotation along the length of the propeller, keeping  thrust more nearly equalized along this length.  

Usually   $1^{\circ}$   to  $4^{\circ}$   provides the most efficient lift/drag ratio,  but in flight the propeller AOA of a fixed-pitch propeller  varies—normally from   $0^{\circ}$   to   $15^{\circ}$  . This variation is caused  by changes in the relative airstream, which in turn results  from changes in aircraft speed. Thus, propeller AOA is the  product of two motions: propeller rotation about its axis and  its forward motion.  

A constant-speed propeller automatically keeps the blade  angle adjusted for maximum efficiency for most conditions  encountered in flight. During takeoff, when maximum power  and thrust are required, the constant-speed propeller is at a  low propeller blade angle or pitch. The low blade angle keeps  the AOA small and efficient with respect to the relative wind.  At the same time, it allows the propeller to handle a smaller  mass of air per revolution. This light load allows the engine to  turn at high rpm and to convert the maximum amount of fuel  into heat energy in a given time. The high rpm also creates  maximum thrust because, although the mass of air handled  per revolution is small, the rpm and slipstream velocity are

high, and with the low aircraft speed, there is maximum thrust. After liftoff, as the speed of the aircraft increases, the constant- speed propeller automatically changes to a higher angle (or  pitch). Again, the higher blade angle keeps the AOA small  and efficient with respect to the relative wind. The higher  blade angle increases the mass of air handled per revolution.  This decreases the engine rpm, reducing fuel consumption  and engine wear, and keeps thrust at a maximum.  

After the takeoff climb is established in an aircraft having a  controllable-pitch propeller, the pilot reduces the power output  of the engine to climb power by first decreasing the manifold  pressure and then increasing the blade angle to lower the rpm.  

At cruising altitude, when the aircraft is in level flight and  less power is required than is used in takeoff or climb, the  pilot again reduces engine power by reducing the manifold  pressure and then increasing the blade angle to decrease the  rpm. Again, this provides a torque requirement to match the  reduced engine power. Although the mass of air handled per  revolution is greater, it is more than offset by a decrease in  slipstream velocity and an increase in airspeed. The AOA is  still small because the blade angle has been increased with  an increase in airspeed.  

# Torque and P-Factor  

To the pilot, “torque” (the left turning tendency of the  airplane) is made up of four elements that cause or produce  a twisting or rotating motion around at least one of the  airplane’s three axes. These four elements are:  

1.	 Torque reaction from engine and propeller  

2.	 Corkscrewing effect of the slipstream 3.	 Gyroscopic action of the propeller 4.	 Asymmetric loading of the propeller (P-factor)  

# Torque Reaction  

Torque reaction involves Newton’s Third Law of Physics— for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. As  applied to the aircraft, this means that as the internal engine  parts and propeller are revolving in one direction, an equal  force is trying to rotate the aircraft in the opposite direction.  [Figure 5-47]  

When the aircraft is airborne, this force is acting around  the longitudinal axis, tending to make the aircraft roll. To  compensate for roll tendency, some of the older aircraft are  rigged in a manner to create more lift on the wing that is being  forced downward. The more modern aircraft are designed  with the engine offset to counteract this effect of torque.  

NOTE: Most United States built aircraft engines rotate the  propeller clockwise, as viewed from the pilot’s seat. The  discussion here is with reference to those engines.  

Generally, the compensating factors are permanently set so  that they compensate for this force at cruising speed, since  most of the aircraft’s operating time is at that speed. However,  aileron trim tabs permit further adjustment for other speeds. When the aircraft’s wheels are on the ground during the  takeoff roll, an additional turning moment around the vertical  axis is induced by torque reaction. As the left side of the  aircraft is being forced down by torque reaction, more weight  is being placed on the left main landing gear. This results in  more ground friction, or drag, on the left tire than on the right,  causing a further turning moment to the left. The magnitude  of this moment is dependent on many variables. Some of  these variables are:  

1.	 Size and horsepower of engine 2.	 Size of propeller and the rpm 3.	 Size of the aircraft 4.	 Condition of the ground surface  

![](images/759b29198455c5cde64485e7ed5b743ba68a586002f69f0b76e4d4e0e2dc8d0e.jpg)  
Figure 5-47.  Torque reaction.  

This yawing moment on the takeoff roll is corrected by the  pilot’s proper use of the rudder or rudder trim.  

# Corkscrew Effect  

The high-speed rotation of an aircraft propeller gives a  corkscrew or spiraling rotation to the slipstream. At high  propeller speeds and low forward speed (as in the takeoffs  and approaches to power-on stalls), this spiraling rotation  is very compact and exerts a strong sideward force on the  aircraft’s vertical tail surface.  [Figure 5-48]  

When this spiraling slipstream strikes the vertical fin, it  causes a yawing moment about the aircraft’s vertical axis.  The more compact the spiral, the more prominent this force  is. As the forward speed increases, however, the spiral  elongates and becomes less effective. The corkscrew flow  of the slipstream also causes a rolling moment around the  longitudinal axis.  

Note that this rolling moment caused by the corkscrew flow  of the slipstream is to the right, while the yawing moment  caused by torque reaction is to the left—in effect one may  be counteracting the other. However, these forces vary  greatly and it is the pilot’s responsibility to apply proper  corrective action by use of the flight controls at all times.  These forces must be counteracted regardless of which is  the most prominent at the time.  

# Gyroscopic Action  

Before the gyroscopic effects of the propeller can be  understood, it is necessary to understand the basic principle  of a gyroscope. All practical applications of the gyroscope  are based upon two fundamental properties of gyroscopic  action: rigidity in space and precession. The one of interest  for this discussion is precession.  

Precession is the resultant action, or deflection, of a spinning  rotor when a deflecting force is applied to its rim. As can be  seen in  Figure 5-49,  when a force is applied, the resulting  force takes effect  $90°$   ahead of and in the direction of rotation. The rotating propeller of an airplane makes a very good  

![](images/7d0da3f85d0da86df9bd6b596d7bf84f22b2630e1714159aa1de22525912efcc.jpg)

Figure 5-49.  Gyroscopic precession.  

gyroscope and thus has similar properties. Any time a force  is applied to deflect the propeller out of its plane of rotation,  the resulting force is   $90°$   ahead of and in the direction of  rotation and in the direction of application, causing a pitching  moment, a yawing moment, or a combination of the two  depending upon the point at which the force was applied.  

This element of torque effect has always been associated with  and considered more prominent in tailwheel-type aircraft  and most often occurs when the tail is being raised during  the takeoff roll.  [Figure 5-50]  This change in pitch attitude  has the same effect as applying a force to the top of the  propeller’s plane of rotation. The resultant force acting  $90^{\circ}$    ahead causes a yawing moment to the left around the vertical  axis. The magnitude of this moment depends on several  variables, one of which is the abruptness with which the tail  is raised (amount of force applied). However, precession,  or gyroscopic action, occurs when a force is applied to any  point on the rim of the propeller’s plane of rotation; the  resultant force will still be  $90°$   from the point of application  in the direction of rotation. Depending on where the force is  applied, the airplane is caused to yaw left or right, to pitch  up or down, or a combination of pitching and yawing.  

It can be said that, as a result of gyroscopic action, any yawing  around the vertical axis results in a pitching moment, and any  pitching around the lateral axis results in a yawing moment.  To correct for the effect of gyroscopic action, it is necessary  for the pilot to properly use elevator and rudder to prevent  undesired pitching and yawing.

Figure 5-50.  Raising tail produces gyroscopic precession.  

# Asymmetric Loading (P-Factor)  

When an aircraft is flying with a high AOA, the “bite” of  the downward moving blade is greater than the “bite” of the  upward moving blade. This moves the center of thrust to the  right of the prop disc area, causing a yawing moment toward  the left around the vertical axis. Proving this explanation is  complex because it would be necessary to work wind vector  problems on each blade while considering both the AOA of  the aircraft and the AOA of each blade.  

This asymmetric loading is caused by the resultant velocity,  which is generated by the combination of the velocity of the  propeller blade in its plane of rotation and the velocity of the  air passing horizontally through the propeller disc. With the  aircraft being flown at positive AOAs, the right (viewed from  the rear) or downswinging blade, is passing through an area of  resultant velocity, which is greater than that affecting the left  or upswinging blade. Since the propeller blade is an airfoil,  increased velocity means increased lift. The downswinging  blade has more lift and tends to pull (yaw) the aircraft’s nose  to the left.  

When the aircraft is flying at a high AOA, the downward  moving blade has a higher resultant velocity, creating more  lift than the upward moving blade.  [Figure 5-51]  This might  be easier to visualize if the propeller shaft was mounted  perpendicular to the ground (like a helicopter). If there  were no air movement at all, except that generated by the  propeller itself, identical sections of each blade would have  the same airspeed. With air moving horizontally across this  vertically mounted propeller, the blade proceeding forward  into the flow of air has a higher airspeed than the blade  retreating with the airflow. Thus, the blade proceeding into  the horizontal airflow is creating more lift, or thrust, moving  the center of thrust toward that blade. Visualize rotating the  vertically mounted propeller shaft to shallower angles relative  to the moving air (as on an aircraft). This unbalanced thrust  then becomes proportionately smaller and continues getting  smaller until it reaches the value of zero when the propeller  shaft is exactly horizontal in relation to the moving air.  

The effects of each of these four elements of torque vary  in value with changes in flight situations. In one phase of  flight, one of these elements may be more prominent than  another. In another phase of flight, another element may be  more prominent. The relationship of these values to each  other varies with different aircraft depending on the airframe,  engine, and propeller combinations, as well as other design  features. To maintain positive control of the aircraft in all  flight conditions, the pilot must apply the flight controls as  necessary to compensate for these varying values.

Figure 5-51.  Asymmetrical loading of propeller (P-factor).  

# Load Factors  

In aerodynamics, the maximum load factor (at given bank  angle) is a proportion between lift and weight and has a  trigonometric relationship. The load factor is measured in  Gs (acceleration of gravity), a unit of force equal to the force  exerted by gravity on a body at rest and indicates the force to  which a body is subjected when it is accelerated. Any force  applied to an aircraft to deflect its flight from a straight line  produces a stress on its structure. The amount of this force  is the load factor. While a course in aerodynamics is not a  prerequisite for obtaining a pilot’s license, the competent  pilot should have a solid understanding of the forces that act  on the aircraft, the advantageous use of these forces, and the  operating limitations of the aircraft being flown.  

For example, a load factor of 3 means the total load on an  aircraft’s structure is three times its weight. Since load factors  are expressed in terms of Gs, a load factor of 3 may be spoken  of as  $3\:\mathrm{fs}$  , or a load factor of 4 as 4 Gs.  

If an aircraft is pulled up from a dive, subjecting the pilot to   $3\;\mathrm{fs}$  , he or she would be pressed down into the seat with a  force equal to three times his or her weight. Since modern  aircraft operate at significantly higher speeds than older  aircraft, increasing the potential for large load factors, this  effect has become a primary consideration in the design of  the structure of all aircraft.  

With the structural design of aircraft planned to withstand  only a certain amount of overload, a knowledge of load  factors has become essential for all pilots. Load factors are  important for two reasons:  

1.	 It is possible for a pilot to impose a dangerous overload  on the aircraft structures. 2.	 An increased load factor increases the stalling speed and  makes stalls possible at seemingly safe flight speeds.  

# Load Factors in Aircraft Design  

The answer to the question “How strong should an aircraft  be?” is determined largely by the use to which the aircraft is  subjected. This is a difficult problem because the maximum  possible loads are much too high for use in efficient design.  It is true that any pilot can make a very hard landing or an  extremely sharp pull up from a dive, which would result in  abnormal loads. However, such extremely abnormal loads  must be dismissed somewhat if aircraft are built that take off  quickly, land slowly, and carry worthwhile payloads.  

The problem of load factors in aircraft design becomes how  to determine the highest load factors that can be expected in  normal operation under various operational situations. These  load factors are called “limit load factors.” For reasons of  safety, it is required that the aircraft be designed to withstand  these load factors without any structural damage. Although  the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) requires the aircraft  structure be capable of supporting one and one-half times  these limit load factors without failure, it is accepted that  parts of the aircraft may bend or twist under these loads and  that some structural damage may occur.  

This 1.5 load limit factor is called the “factor of safety” and  provides, to some extent, for loads higher than those expected  under normal and reasonable operation. This strength reserve  is not something that pilots should willfully abuse; rather, it is  there for protection when encountering unexpected conditions.  

The above considerations apply to all loading conditions,  whether they be due to gusts, maneuvers, or landings. The  gust load factor requirements now in effect are substantially  the same as those that have been in existence for years.  Hundreds of thousands of operational hours have proven  them adequate for safety. Since the pilot has little control over  gust load factors (except to reduce the aircraft’s speed when  rough air is encountered), the gust loading requirements are  substantially the same for most general aviation type aircraft  regardless of their operational use. Generally, the gust load  factors control the design of aircraft which are intended for  strictly nonacrobatic usage.  

An entirely different situation exists in aircraft design with  maneuvering load factors. It is necessary to discuss this matter  separately with respect to: (1) aircraft designed in accordance  with the category system (i.e., normal, utility, acrobatic); and  (2) older designs built according to requirements that did not  provide for operational categories.  

Aircraft designed under the category system are readily  identified by a placard in the flight deck, which states the  operational category (or categories) in which the aircraft  is certificated. The maximum safe load factors (limit load  factors) specified for aircraft in the various categories are:  

![](images/d224a94a49e781e5dd83a2f457511130fb6b008944f213ea02b55864927da014.jpg)  

1  For aircraft with gross weight of more than 4,000 pounds,  the limit load factor is reduced. To the limit loads given  above, a safety factor of 50 percent is added.  

There is an upward graduation in load factor with the  increasing severity of maneuvers. The category system  provides for maximum utility of an aircraft. If normal  operation alone is intended, the required load factor (and  consequently the weight of the aircraft) is less than if the  aircraft is to be employed in training or acrobatic maneuvers  as they result in higher maneuvering loads.  

Aircraft that do not have the category placard are designs that  were constructed under earlier engineering requirements in  which no operational restrictions were specifically given to  the pilots. For aircraft of this type (up to weights of about  4,000 pounds), the required strength is comparable to present- day utility category aircraft, and the same types of operation  are permissible. For aircraft of this type over 4,000 pounds,  the load factors decrease with weight. These aircraft should  be regarded as being comparable to the normal category  aircraft designed under the category system, and they should  be operated accordingly.  

# Load Factors in Steep Turns  

At a constant altitude, during a coordinated turn in any  aircraft, the load factor is the result of two forces: centrifugal  force and weight.  [Figure 5-52]  For any given bank angle,  the ROT varies with the airspeed—the higher the speed, the  

![](images/c223829646e0f8e9e6450d1b9d5302340258b6c4105eb14d50843244cb9e1b5d.jpg)  
Figure 5-52.  Two forces cause load factor during turns.  

slower the ROT. This compensates for added centrifugal  force, allowing the load factor to remain the same.  

Figure 5-53  reveals an important fact about turns—the load  factor increases at a terrific rate after a bank has reached   $45^{\circ}$   or  $50^{\circ}$  . The load factor for any aircraft in a coordinated  level turn at  $60^{\circ}$   bank is  $2\,\mathrm{fs}$  . The load factor in an  $80^{\circ}$   bank  is   $5.76\;\mathrm{fs}$  . The wing must produce lift equal to these load  factors if altitude is to be maintained.  

It should be noted how rapidly the line denoting load factor  rises as it approaches the  $90^{\circ}$   bank line, which it never quite  reaches because a  $90^{\circ}$   banked, constant altitude turn is not  mathematically possible. An aircraft may be banked to  $90^{\circ}$  in a coordinated turn if not trying to hold altitude. An aircraft  that can be held in a  $90^{\circ}$   banked slipping turn is capable of  straight knife-edged flight. At slightly more than   $80^{\circ}$  , the  load factor exceeds the limit of  $6\,\mathrm{{Gs}}$  , the limit load factor of  an acrobatic aircraft.  

For a coordinated, constant altitude turn, the approximate  maximum bank for the average general aviation aircraft is  $60^{\circ}$  .  This bank and its resultant necessary power setting reach the  limit of this type of aircraft. An additional  $10^{\circ}$   bank increases  the load factor by approximately 1 G, bringing it close to the  yield point established for these aircraft.  [Figure 5-54]  

# Load Factors and Stalling Speeds  

Any aircraft, within the limits of its structure, may be stalled  at any airspeed. When a sufficiently high AOA is imposed,  the smooth flow of air over an airfoil breaks up and separates,  producing an abrupt change of flight characteristics and a  sudden loss of lift, which results in a stall.  

A study of this effect has revealed that an aircraft’s stalling  speed increases in proportion to the square root of the  

![](images/1531b28c17b4ab254240af28bb1ec9c825a055a191a30ae89e86f1c4fbe7bf07.jpg)  
Figure 5-53.  Angle of bank changes load factor in level flight.  

load factor. This means that an aircraft with a normal  unaccelerated stalling speed of 50 knots can be stalled at 100  knots by inducing a load factor of 4 Gs. If it were possible  for this aircraft to withstand a load factor of nine, it could  be stalled at a speed of 150 knots. A pilot should be aware  of the following:  

•	 The danger of inadvertently stalling the aircraft by  increasing the load factor, as in a steep turn or spiral;  •	 When intentionally stalling an aircraft above its  design maneuvering speed, a tremendous load factor  is imposed.  

Figures 5-53  and  5-54  show that banking an aircraft greater  than  $72^{\circ}$   in a steep turn produces a load factor of 3, and the  stalling speed is increased significantly. If this turn is made  in an aircraft with a normal unaccelerated stalling speed of  45 knots, the airspeed must be kept greater than 75 knots to  prevent inducing a stall. A similar effect is experienced in a  quick pull up or any maneuver producing load factors above  1 G. This sudden, unexpected loss of control, particularly in  a steep turn or abrupt application of the back elevator control  near the ground, has caused many accidents.  

Since the load factor is squared as the stalling speed doubles,  tremendous loads may be imposed on structures by stalling  an aircraft at relatively high airspeeds.  

The following information primarily applies to fixed-wing  airplanes. The maximum speed at which an airplane may  be stalled safely is now determined for all new designs.  

This speed is called the “design maneuvering speed”   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$  ,  which is the speed below which you can move a single  flight control, one time, to its full deflection, for one axis  of airplane rotation only (pitch, roll or yaw), in smooth  air, without risk of damage to the airplane.   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$   must be  entered in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual/ Pilot’s Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) of all recently  designed airplanes. For older general aviation airplanes,  this speed is approximately 1.7 times the normal stalling  speed. Thus, an older airplane that normally stalls at 60  knots must never be stalled at above 102 knots (60 knots  $\times$   $1.7=102$   knots). An airplane with a normal stalling speed  of 60 knots stalled at 102 knots undergoes a load factor  equal to the square of the increase in speed, or 2.89 Gs (1.7   $\times\:1.7=2.89\:\mathrm{GS})$  ). (The above figures are approximations to  be considered as a guide, and are not the exact answers to  any set of problems. The design maneuvering speed should  be determined from the particular airplane’s operating  limitations provided by the manufacturer.) Operating at or  below design maneuvering speed does not provide structural  protection against multiple full control inputs in one axis or  full control inputs in more than one axis at the same time.  

Since the leverage in the control system varies with different  aircraft (some types employ “balanced” control surfaces while  others do not), the pressure exerted by the pilot on the controls  cannot be accepted as an index of the load factors produced  in different aircraft. In most cases, load factors can be judged  by the experienced pilot from the feel of seat pressure. Load  factors can also be measured by an instrument called an  “accelerometer,” but this instrument is not common in general

aviation training aircraft. The development of the ability to  judge load factors from the feel of their effect on the body is  important. A knowledge of these principles is essential to the  development of the ability to estimate load factors.  

A thorough knowledge of load factors induced by varying  degrees of bank and the   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$   aids in the prevention of two of  the most serious types of accidents:  

1.	 Stalls from steep turns or excessive maneuvering near  the ground 2.	 Structural failures during acrobatics or other violent  maneuvers resulting from loss of control  

# Load Factors and Flight Maneuvers  

Critical load factors apply to all flight maneuvers except  unaccelerated straight flight where a load factor of   $1~\mathrm{G}$   is  always present. Certain maneuvers considered in this section  are known to involve relatively high load factors. Full  application of pitch, roll, or yaw controls should be confined  to speeds below the maneuvering speed. Avoid rapid and  large alternating control inputs, especially in combination  with large changes in pitch, roll, or yaw (e.g., large sideslip  angles) as they may result in structural failures at any speed,  including below   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$  .  

# Turns  

Increased load factors are a characteristic of all banked  turns. As noted in the section on load factors in steep turns,  load factors become significant to both flight performance  and load on wing structure as the bank increases beyond  approximately   $45^{\circ}$  .  

The yield factor of the average light plane is reached  at a bank of approximately   $70^{\circ}$   to   $75^{\circ}$  , and the stalling  speed is increased by approximately one-half at a bank of  approximately   $63^{\circ}$  .  

# Stalls  

The normal stall entered from straight-and-level flight, or an  unaccelerated straight climb, does not produce added load  factors beyond the   $1~\mathrm{G}$   of straight-and-level flight. As the  stall occurs, however, this load factor may be reduced toward  zero, the factor at which nothing seems to have weight. The  pilot experiences a sensation of “floating free in space.” If  recovery is effected by snapping the elevator control forward,  negative load factors (or those that impose a down load on  the wings and raise the pilot from the seat) may be produced.  

During the pull up following stall recovery, significant  load factors are sometimes induced. These may be further  increased inadvertently during excessive diving (and  consequently high airspeed) and abrupt pull ups to level  flight. One usually leads to the other, thus increasing the load  factor. Abrupt pull ups at high diving speeds may impose  critical loads on aircraft structures and may produce recurrent  or secondary stalls by increasing the AOA to that of stalling.  

As a generalization, a recovery from a stall made by diving  only to cruising or design maneuvering airspeed, with a  gradual pull up as soon as the airspeed is safely above stalling,  can be effected with a load factor not to exceed 2 or  $2.5\,\mathrm{fs}$  . A  higher load factor should never be necessary unless recovery  has been effected with the aircraft’s nose near or beyond the  vertical attitude or at extremely low altitudes to avoid diving  into the ground.  

# Spins  

A stabilized spin is not different from a stall in any element  other than rotation and the same load factor considerations  apply to spin recovery as apply to stall recovery. Since spin  recoveries are usually effected with the nose much lower than is  common in stall recoveries, higher airspeeds and consequently  higher load factors are to be expected. The load factor in a  proper spin recovery usually is found to be about  $2.5\,\mathrm{fs}$  .  

The load factor during a spin varies with the spin characteristics  of each aircraft, but is usually found to be slightly above the   $1\,\mathrm{G}$   of level flight. There are two reasons for this:  

1.	 Airspeed in a spin is very low, usually within 2 knots  of the unaccelerated stalling speeds. 2.	 An aircraft pivots, rather than turns, while it is in a spin.  

# High Speed Stalls  

The average light plane is not built to withstand the repeated  application of load factors common to high speed stalls.  The load factor necessary for these maneuvers produces a  stress on the wings and tail structure, which does not leave  a reasonable margin of safety in most light aircraft.  

The only way this stall can be induced at an airspeed above  normal stalling involves the imposition of an added load  factor, which may be accomplished by a severe pull on the  elevator control. A speed of 1.7 times stalling speed (about  102 knots in a light aircraft with a stalling speed of 60 knots)  produces a load factor of 3 Gs. Only a very narrow margin  for error can be allowed for acrobatics in light aircraft. To  illustrate how rapidly the load factor increases with airspeed,  a high-speed stall at 112 knots in the same aircraft would  produce a load factor of  $4\:\mathrm{fs}$  .  

# Chandelles and Lazy Eights  

A chandelle is a maximum performance climbing turn  beginning from approximately straight-and-level flight,  and ending at the completion of a precise   $180^{\circ}$   turn in a  wings-level, nose-high attitude at the minimum controllable  airspeed. In this flight maneuver, the aircraft is in a steep  climbing turn and almost stalls to gain altitude while changing  direction. A lazy eight derives its name from the manner in  which the extended longitudinal axis of the aircraft is made  to trace a flight pattern in the form of a figure “8” lying on  its side. It would be difficult to make a definite statement  concerning load factors in these maneuvers as both involve  smooth, shallow dives and pull-ups. The load factors incurred  depend directly on the speed of the dives and the abruptness  of the pull-ups during these maneuvers.  

Generally, the better the maneuver is performed, the less  extreme the load factor induced. A chandelle or lazy eight  in which the pull-up produces a load factor greater than 2 Gs  will not result in as great a gain in altitude; in low-powered  aircraft, it may result in a net loss of altitude.  

The smoothest pull-up possible, with a moderate load factor,  delivers the greatest gain in altitude in a chandelle and results  in a better overall performance in both chandelles and lazy  eights. The recommended entry speed for these maneuvers  is generally near the manufacturer’s design maneuvering  speed, which allows maximum development of load factors  without exceeding the load limits.  

# Rough Air  

All standard certificated aircraft are designed to withstand  loads imposed by gusts of considerable intensity. Gust load  factors increase with increasing airspeed, and the strength used  for design purposes usually corresponds to the highest level  flight speed. In extremely rough air, as in thunderstorms or  frontal conditions, it is wise to reduce the speed to the design  maneuvering speed. Regardless of the speed held, there may  be gusts that can produce loads that exceed the load limits.  

Each specific aircraft is designed with a specific G loading  that can be imposed on the aircraft without causing structural  damage. There are two types of load factors factored into  aircraft design: limit load and ultimate load. The limit load  is a force applied to an aircraft that causes a bending of the  aircraft structure that does not return to the original shape.  The ultimate load is the load factor applied to the aircraft  beyond the limit load and at which point the aircraft material  experiences structural failure (breakage). Load factors lower  than the limit load can be sustained without compromising  the integrity of the aircraft structure.  

Speeds up to, but not exceeding, the maneuvering speed  allow an aircraft to stall prior to experiencing an increase in  load factor that would exceed the limit load of the aircraft.  

Most AFM/POH now include turbulent air penetration  information, which help today’s pilots safely fly aircraft  capable of a wide range of speeds and altitudes. It is important  for the pilot to remember that the maximum “never-exceed”  placard dive speeds are determined for smooth air only. High  speed dives or acrobatics involving speed above the known  maneuvering speed should never be practiced in rough or  turbulent air.  

# Vg Diagram  

The flight operating strength of an aircraft is presented  on a graph whose vertical scale is based on load factor.  [Figure 5-55]  The diagram is called a  $\mathrm{Vg}$   diagram—velocity  versus G loads or load factor. Each aircraft has its own  $\mathrm{Vg}$  diagram that is valid at a certain weight and altitude.  

The lines of maximum lift capability (curved lines) are the  first items of importance on the  $\mathrm{Vg}$   diagram. The aircraft in  Figure 5-53  is capable of developing no more than  $+1\;\mathrm{G}$   at   $64~\mathrm{mph}$  , the wing level stall speed of the aircraft. Since the  maximum load factor varies with the square of the airspeed,  the maximum positive lift capability of this aircraft is  $_{2\,\mathrm{G}}$   at  92 mph, 3 G at  $112\,\mathrm{mph}$  ,  $4.4\,\mathrm{G}$   at  $137\,\mathrm{mph}$  , and so forth. Any  load factor above this line is unavailable aerodynamically  (i.e., the aircraft cannot fly above the line of maximum lift  capability because it stalls). The same situation exists for  negative lift flight with the exception that the speed necessary  to produce a given negative load factor is higher than that to  produce the same positive load factor.  

If the aircraft is flown at a positive load factor greater than the  positive limit load factor of 4.4, structural damage is possible.  When the aircraft is operated in this region, objectionable  permanent deformation of the primary structure may take place  and a high rate of fatigue damage is incurred. Operation above  the limit load factor must be avoided in normal operation.  

There are two other points of importance on the  $\mathrm{Vg}$   diagram.  One point is the intersection of the positive limit load factor  and the line of maximum positive lift capability. The airspeed  at this point is the minimum airspeed at which the limit load  can be developed aerodynamically. Any airspeed greater than  this provides a positive lift capability sufficient to damage  the aircraft. Conversely, any airspeed less than this does not  provide positive lift capability sufficient to cause damage  from excessive flight loads. The usual term given to this speed  is “maneuvering speed,” since consideration of subsonic  aerodynamics would predict minimum usable turn radius or  maneuverability to occur at this condition. The maneuver  speed is a valuable reference point, since an aircraft operating  below this point cannot produce a damaging positive flight  load. Any combination of maneuver and gust cannot create  damage due to excess airload when the aircraft is below the  maneuver speed.  

![](images/f346830b3493b49b19042ff349bbd603afb91c6aabbafd7b4a224f8b5ea04a1b.jpg)  
Figure 5-55.  Typical  $V g$   diagram.  

The other point of importance on the   $\mathrm{Vg}$   diagram is the  intersection of the negative limit load factor and line of  maximum negative lift capability. Any airspeed greater than  this provides a negative lift capability sufficient to damage  the aircraft; any airspeed less than this does not provide  negative lift capability sufficient to damage the aircraft from  excessive flight loads.  

The limit airspeed (or redline speed) is a design reference point  for the aircraft—this aircraft is limited to  $225~\mathrm{mph}$  . If flight  is attempted beyond the limit airspeed, structural damage or  structural failure may result from a variety of phenomena.  

The aircraft in flight is limited to a regime of airspeeds  and Gs that do not exceed the limit (or redline) speed, do  not exceed the limit load factor, and cannot exceed the  maximum lift capability. The aircraft must be operated  within this “envelope” to prevent structural damage and  ensure the anticipated service lift of the aircraft is obtained.  The pilot must appreciate the  $\mathrm{Vg}$   diagram as describing the  allowable combination of airspeeds and load factors for  safe operation. Any maneuver, gust, or gust plus maneuver  outside the structural envelope can cause structural damage  and effectively shorten the service life of the aircraft.  

# Rate of Turn  

The rate of turn (ROT) is the number of degrees (expressed in  degrees per second) of heading change that an aircraft makes.  The ROT can be determined by taking the constant of 1,091,  multiplying it by the tangent of any bank angle and dividing  that product by a given airspeed in knots as illustrated in  Figure 5-55.  If the airspeed is increased and the ROT desired  is to be constant, the angle of bank must be increased,  otherwise, the ROT decreases. Likewise, if the airspeed is  held constant, an aircraft’s ROT increases if the bank angle  is increased. The formula in  Figures 5-56  through  5-58 depicts the relationship between bank angle and airspeed as  they affect the ROT.  

NOTE: All airspeed discussed in this section is true airspeed  (TAS).  

Airspeed significantly effects an aircraft’s ROT. If airspeed is  increased, the ROT is reduced if using the same angle of bank  used at the lower speed. Therefore, if airspeed is increased  as illustrated in  Figure 5-57,  it can be inferred that the angle  of bank must be increased in order to achieve the same ROT  achieved in  Figure 5-58.  

![](images/a740b7c0f6fbab0edc11a0d788b67b7e628b916d22d31d6bb76dea1265033527.jpg)  
Figure 5-56.  Rate of turn for a given airspeed (knots, TAS) and  bank angle.  

What does this mean on a practicable side? If a given  airspeed and bank angle produces a specific ROT, additional  conclusions can be made. Knowing the ROT is a given number  of degrees of change per second, the number of seconds it  takes to travel   $360^{\circ}$   (a circle) can be determined by simple  division. For example, if moving at 120 knots with a  $30^{\circ}$   bank  angle, the ROT is  $5.25^{\circ}$   per second and it takes 68.6 seconds  (  $360^{\circ}$   divided by  $5.25=68.6$   seconds) to make a complete  circle. Likewise, if flying at 240 knots TAS and using a   $30^{\circ}$  angle of bank, the ROT is only about  $2.63^{\circ}$   per second and it  takes about 137 seconds to complete a  $360^{\circ}$   circle. Looking at  the formula, any increase in airspeed is directly proportional  to the time the aircraft takes to travel an arc.  

So why is this important to understand? Once the ROT is  understood, a pilot can determine the distance required to  make that particular turn, which is explained in radius of turn.  

# Radius of Turn  

The radius of turn is directly linked to the ROT, which  explained earlier is a function of both bank angle and  airspeed. If the bank angle is held constant and the airspeed  is increased, the radius of the turn changes (increases). A  higher airspeed causes the aircraft to travel through a longer  

![](images/454a43112e5c708ea7471eb5f9ec46f1eaa56229f963b04d22862a4dae96a9ae.jpg)

arc due to a greater speed. An aircraft traveling at 120 knots  is able to turn a  $360^{\circ}$   circle in a tighter radius than an aircraft  traveling at 240 knots. In order to compensate for the increase  in airspeed, the bank angle would need to be increased.  

The radius of turn (R) can be computed using a simple  formula. The radius of turn is equal to the velocity squared   $(\mathbf{V}^{2})$   divided by 11.26 times the tangent of the bank angle.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathrm{R}=}&{{}}&{\frac{\mathrm{V}^{2}}{11.26\,\times\,\mathrm{tangent\,of\,bank\,angle}}}\end{array}
$$  

Using the examples provided in  Figures 5-56  through  5-58,  the  turn radius for each of the two speeds can be computed.  

Note that if the speed is doubled, the radius is quadrupled.  [Figures 5-59  and  5-60]  

Another way to determine the radius of turn is speed using  feet per second (fps),  $\pi$   (3.1415), and the ROT. In one of the  previous examples, it was determined that an aircraft with  a ROT of 5.25 degrees per second required 68.6 seconds to  make a complete circle.   An aircraft’s speed (in knots) can

The radius of a turn required by an aircraft traveling at 240 knots  using the same bank angle in Figure 4-51 is 8,861 feet. Speed  is a major factor in a turn.

be converted to fps by multiplying it by a constant of 1.69.  Therefore, an aircraft traveling at 120 knots (TAS) travels  at 202.8 fps. Knowing the speed in fps (202.8) multiplied by  the time an aircraft takes to complete a circle (68.6 seconds)  can determine the size of the circle; 202.8 times 68.6 equals  13,912 feet. Dividing by   $\pi$   yields a diameter of 4,428 feet,  which when divided by 2 equals a radius of 2,214 feet  [Figure 5-61],  a foot within that determined through use of  the formula in  Figure 5-59.  

In  Figure 5-62,  the pilot enters a canyon and decides to turn   $180^{\circ}$   to exit. The pilot uses a  $30^{\circ}$   bank angle in his turn.  

# Weight and Balance  

The aircraft’s weight and balance data is important  information for a pilot that must be frequently reevaluated.  Although the aircraft was weighed during the certification  process, this information is not valid indefinitely. Equipment  changes or modifications affect the weight and balance data.  Too often pilots reduce the aircraft weight and balance into  a rule of thumb, such as: “If I have three passengers, I can  load only 100 gallons of fuel; four passengers, 70 gallons.”  

Weight and balance computations should be part of every  preflight briefing. Never assume three passengers are always

of equal weight. Instead, do a full computation of all items  to be loaded on the aircraft, including baggage, as well as  the pilot and passenger. It is recommended that all bags be  weighed to make a precise computation of how the aircraft  CG is positioned.  

The importance of the CG was stressed in the discussion  of stability, controllability, and performance. Unequal load  distribution causes accidents. A competent pilot understands  and respects the effects of CG on an aircraft.  

Weight and balance are critical components in the utilization  of an aircraft to its fullest potential. The pilot must know  how much fuel can be loaded onto the aircraft without  violating CG limits, as well as weight limits to conduct  long or short flights with or without a full complement of  allowable passengers. For example, an aircraft has four seats  and can carry 60 gallons of fuel. How many passengers can  the aircraft safely carry? Can all those seats be occupied at  all times with the varying fuel loads? Four people who each  weigh 150 pounds leads to a different weight and balance  computation than four people who each weigh 200 pounds.  The second scenario loads an additional 200 pounds onto the  aircraft and is equal to about 30 gallons of fuel.  

The additional weight may or may not place the CG outside  of the CG envelope, but the maximum gross weight could  be exceeded. The excess weight can overstress the aircraft  and degrade the performance.  

Aircraft are certificated for weight and balance for two  principal reasons:  

1.	 The effect of the weight on the aircraft’s primary  structure and its performance characteristics 2.	 The effect of the location of this weight on flight  characteristics, particularly in stall and spin recovery  and stability  

Aircraft, such as balloons and weight-shift control, do not  require weight and balance computations because the load  is suspended below the lifting mechanism. The CG range  in these types of aircraft is such that it is difficult to exceed  loading limits. For example, the rear seat position and fuel  of a weight-shift control aircraft are as close as possible to  the hang point with the aircraft in a suspended attitude. Thus,  load variations have little effect on the CG. This also holds  true for the balloon basket or gondola. While it is difficult  to exceed CG limits in these aircraft, pilots should never  overload an aircraft because overloading causes structural  damage and failures. Weight and balance computations are  not required, but pilots should calculate weight and remain  within the manufacturer’s established limit.

Figure 5-62.   Two aircraft have flown into a canyon by error. The canyon is 5,000 feet across and has sheer cliffs on both sides. The pilot  in the top image is flying at 120 knots. After realizing the error, the pilot banks hard and uses a  $30^{\circ}$   bank angle to reverse course.  This  aircraft requires about 4,000 feet to turn  $I80^{\circ}$  , and makes it out of the canyon safely. The pilot in the bottom image is flying at 140 knots  and also uses a  $30^{\circ}$   angle of bank in an attempt to reverse course. The aircraft, although flying just 20 knots faster than the aircraft in the  top image, requires over 6,000 feet to reverse course to safety. Unfortunately, the canyon is only 5,000 feet across and the aircraft will hit  the canyon wall. The point is that airspeed is the most influential factor in determining how much distance is required to turn. Many pilots  have made the error of increasing the steepness of their bank angle when a simple reduction of speed would have been more appropriate.  

# Effect of Weight on Flight Performance  

The takeoff/climb and landing performance of an aircraft are  determined on the basis of its maximum allowable takeoff and  landing weights. A heavier gross weight results in a longer  takeoff run and shallower climb, and a faster touchdown  speed and longer landing roll. Even a minor overload may  make it impossible for the aircraft to clear an obstacle that  normally would not be a problem during takeoff under more  favorable conditions.  

The detrimental effects of overloading on performance are  not limited to the immediate hazards involved with takeoffs  and landings. Overloading has an adverse effect on all  climb and cruise performance, which leads to overheating  during climbs, added wear on engine parts, increased fuel  consumption, slower cruising speeds, and reduced range.  

The manufacturers of modern aircraft furnish weight and  balance data with each aircraft produced. Generally, this  information may be found in the FAA-approved AFM/POH  and easy-to-read charts for determining weight and balance  data are now provided. Increased performance and load- carrying capability of these aircraft require strict adherence  to the operating limitations prescribed by the manufacturer.  Deviations from the recommendations can result in structural  damage or complete failure of the aircraft’s structure. Even  if an aircraft is loaded well within the maximum weight  limitations, it is imperative that weight distribution be  within the limits of CG location. The preceding brief study  of aerodynamics and load factors points out the reasons for  this precaution. The following discussion is background  information into some of the reasons why weight and balance  conditions are important to the safe flight of an aircraft.  

In some aircraft, it is not possible to fill all seats, baggage  compartments, and fuel tanks, and still remain within  approved weight or balance limits. For example, in several  popular four-place aircraft, the fuel tanks may not be filled to  capacity when four occupants and their baggage are carried.  In a certain two-place aircraft, no baggage may be carried  in the compartment aft of the seats when spins are to be  practiced. It is important for a pilot to be aware of the weight  and balance limitations of the aircraft being flown and the  reasons for these limitations.  

# Effect of Weight on Aircraft Structure  

The effect of additional weight on the wing structure of an  aircraft is not readily apparent. Airworthiness requirements  prescribe that the structure of an aircraft certificated in the  normal category (in which acrobatics are prohibited) must  be strong enough to withstand a load factor of  $3.8\,\mathrm{fs}$   to take  care of dynamic loads caused by maneuvering and gusts. This  means that the primary structure of the aircraft can withstand  a load of 3.8 times the approved gross weight of the aircraft  without structural failure occurring. If this is accepted as  indicative of the load factors that may be imposed during  operations for which the aircraft is intended, a 100-pound  overload imposes a potential structural overload of 380  pounds. The same consideration is even more impressive  in the case of utility and acrobatic category aircraft, which  have load factor requirements of 4.4 and 6.0, respectively.  

Structural failures that result from overloading may be  dramatic and catastrophic, but more often they affect  structural components progressively in a manner that  is difficult to detect and expensive to repair. Habitual  overloading tends to cause cumulative stress and damage  that may not be detected during preflight inspections and  result in structural failure later during completely normal  operations. The additional stress placed on structural parts  by overloading is believed to accelerate the occurrence of  metallic fatigue failures.  

A knowledge of load factors imposed by flight maneuvers  and gusts emphasizes the consequences of an increase in the  gross weight of an aircraft. The structure of an aircraft about to  undergo a load factor of 3 Gs, as in recovery from a steep dive,  must be prepared to withstand an added load of 300 pounds  for each 100-pound increase in weight. It should be noted that  this would be imposed by the addition of about 16 gallons  of unneeded fuel in a particular aircraft. FAA-certificated  civil aircraft have been analyzed structurally and tested for  flight at the maximum gross weight authorized and within the  speeds posted for the type of flights to be performed. Flights at  weights in excess of this amount are quite possible and often  are well within the performance capabilities of an aircraft.  This fact should not mislead the pilot, as the pilot may not  realize that loads for which the aircraft was not designed are  being imposed on all or some part of the structure.  

In loading an aircraft with either passengers or cargo, the  structure must be considered. Seats, baggage compartments,  and cabin floors are designed for a certain load or  concentration of load and no more. For example, a light  plane baggage compartment may be placarded for 20 pounds  because of the limited strength of its supporting structure  even though the aircraft may not be overloaded or out of CG  limits with more weight at that location.  

# Effect of Weight on Stability and Controllability  

Overloading also affects stability. An aircraft that is stable  and controllable when loaded normally may have very  different flight characteristics when overloaded. Although  the distribution of weight has the most direct effect on this,  an increase in the aircraft’s gross weight may be expected  to have an adverse effect on stability, regardless of location  of the CG. The stability of many certificated aircraft is  completely unsatisfactory if the gross weight is exceeded.  

# Effect of Load Distribution  

The effect of the position of the CG on the load imposed  on an aircraft’s wing in flight is significant to climb and  cruising performance. An aircraft with forward loading is  “heavier” and consequently, slower than the same aircraft  with the CG further aft.  

Figure 5-63  illustrates why this is true. With forward loading,  “nose-up” trim is required in most aircraft to maintain level  cruising flight. Nose-up trim involves setting the tail surfaces  to produce a greater down load on the aft portion of the  fuselage, which adds to the wing loading and the total lift  required from the wing if altitude is to be maintained. This  requires a higher AOA of the wing, which results in more  drag and, in turn, produces a higher stalling speed.  

With aft loading and “nose-down” trim, the tail surfaces  exert less down load, relieving the wing of that much wing  loading and lift required to maintain altitude. The required  AOA of the wing is less, so the drag is less, allowing for a  faster cruise speed. Theoretically, a neutral load on the tail  surfaces in cruising flight would produce the most efficient  overall performance and fastest cruising speed, but it would  also result in instability. Modern aircraft are designed to  require a down load on the tail for stability and controllability. A zero indication on the trim tab control is not necessarily  the same as “neutral trim” because of the force exerted by  downwash from the wings and the fuselage on the tail surfaces.  

The effects of the distribution of the aircraft’s useful load  have a significant influence on its flight characteristics, even  when the load is within the CG limits and the maximum  

![](images/344f3397bfcc33827312e4f159761b3761a7da7f9e48f4f6d89a7cf170c41932.jpg)  
Figure 5-63.  Effect of load distribution on balance.  

permissible gross weight. Important among these effects  are changes in controllability, stability, and the actual load  imposed on the wing.  

Generally, an aircraft becomes less controllable, especially  at slow flight speeds, as the CG is moved further aft. An  aircraft that cleanly recovers from a prolonged spin with  the CG at one position may fail completely to respond to  normal recovery attempts when the CG is moved aft by one  or two inches.  

It is common practice for aircraft designers to establish  an aft CG limit that is within one inch of the maximum,  which allows normal recovery from a one-turn spin. When  certificating an aircraft in the utility category to permit  intentional spins, the aft CG limit is usually established  at a point several inches forward of that permissible for  certification in the normal category.  

Another factor affecting controllability, which has become  more important in current designs of large aircraft, is the  effect of long moment arms to the positions of heavy  equipment and cargo. The same aircraft may be loaded to  maximum gross weight within its CG limits by concentrating  fuel, passengers, and cargo near the design CG, or by  dispersing fuel and cargo loads in wingtip tanks and cargo  bins forward and aft of the cabin.  

With the same total weight and CG, maneuvering the  aircraft or maintaining level flight in turbulent air requires  the application of greater control forces when the load is  dispersed. The longer moment arms to the positions of the  heavy fuel and cargo loads must be overcome by the action  of the control surfaces. An aircraft with full outboard wing  tanks or tip tanks tends to be sluggish in roll when control  situations are marginal, while one with full nose and aft cargo  bins tends to be less responsive to the elevator controls.  

The rearward CG limit of an aircraft is determined largely  by considerations of stability. The original airworthiness  requirements for a type certificate specify that an aircraft in  flight at a certain speed dampens out vertical displacement of  the nose within a certain number of oscillations. An aircraft  loaded too far rearward may not do this. Instead, when the  nose is momentarily pulled up, it may alternately climb and  dive becoming steeper with each oscillation. This instability  is not only uncomfortable to occupants, but it could even  become dangerous by making the aircraft unmanageable  under certain conditions.  

The recovery from a stall in any aircraft becomes progressively  more difficult as its CG moves aft. This is particularly  important in spin recovery, as there is a point in rearward  loading of any aircraft at which a “flat” spin develops. A  flat spin is one in which centrifugal force, acting through a  CG located well to the rear, pulls the tail of the aircraft out  away from the axis of the spin, making it impossible to get  the nose down and recover.  

An aircraft loaded to the rear limit of its permissible CG  range handles differently in turns and stall maneuvers and  has different landing characteristics than when it is loaded  near the forward limit.  

The forward CG limit is determined by a number of  considerations. As a safety measure, it is required that the  trimming device, whether tab or adjustable stabilizer, be  capable of holding the aircraft in a normal glide with the power  off. A conventional aircraft must be capable of a full stall,  power-off landing in order to ensure minimum landing speed  in emergencies. A tailwheel-type aircraft loaded excessively  nose-heavy is difficult to taxi, particularly in high winds. It  can be nosed over easily by use of the brakes, and it is difficult  to land without bouncing since it tends to pitch down on the  wheels as it is slowed down and flared for landing. Steering  difficulties on the ground may occur in nosewheel-type  aircraft, particularly during the landing roll and takeoff. The  effects of load distribution are summarized as follows:  

•	 The CG position influences the lift and AOA of the  wing, the amount and direction of force on the tail,  and the degree of deflection of the stabilizer needed  to supply the proper tail force for equilibrium. The  latter is very important because of its relationship to  elevator control force. •	 The aircraft stalls at a higher speed with a forward CG  location. This is because the stalling AOA is reached  at a higher speed due to increased wing loading. •	 Higher elevator control forces normally exist with a  forward CG location due to the increased stabilizer  deflection required to balance the aircraft. •	 The aircraft cruises faster with an aft CG location  because of reduced drag. The drag is reduced because  a smaller AOA and less downward deflection of the  stabilizer are required to support the aircraft and  overcome the nose-down pitching tendency. •	 The aircraft becomes less stable as the CG is moved  rearward. This is because when the CG is moved  rearward, it causes a decrease in the AOA. Therefore,  the wing contribution to the aircraft’s stability is  now decreased, while the tail contribution is still  stabilizing. When the point is reached that the wing  and tail contributions balance, then neutral stability  exists. Any CG movement further aft results in an  unstable aircraft.  

•	 A forward CG location increases the need for greater  back elevator pressure. The elevator may no longer  be able to oppose any increase in nose-down pitching.  Adequate elevator control is needed to control the  aircraft throughout the airspeed range down to the stall.  

A detailed discussion and additional information relating  to weight and balance can be found in Chapter 10, Weight  and Balance.  

# High Speed Flight  

# Subsonic Versus Supersonic Flow  

In subsonic aerodynamics, the theory of lift is based upon the  forces generated on a body and a moving gas (air) in which  it is immersed. At speeds of approximately 260 knots or  less, air can be considered incompressible in that, at a fixed  altitude, its density remains nearly constant while its pressure  varies. Under this assumption, air acts the same as water and  is classified as a fluid. Subsonic aerodynamic theory also  assumes the effects of viscosity (the property of a fluid that  tends to prevent motion of one part of the fluid with respect  to another) are negligible and classifies air as an ideal fluid  conforming to the principles of ideal-fluid aerodynamics such  as continuity, Bernoulli’s principle, and circulation.  

In reality, air is compressible and viscous. While the effects of  these properties are negligible at low speeds, compressibility  effects in particular become increasingly important as speed  increases. Compressibility (and to a lesser extent viscosity) is  of paramount importance at speeds approaching the speed of  sound. In these speed ranges, compressibility causes a change  in the density of the air around an aircraft.  

During flight, a wing produces lift by accelerating the airflow  over the upper surface. This accelerated air can, and does,  reach sonic speeds even though the aircraft itself may be flying  subsonic. At some extreme AOAs, in some aircraft, the speed  of the air over the top surface of the wing may be double the  aircraft’s speed. It is therefore entirely possible to have both  supersonic and subsonic airflow on an aircraft at the same time.  When flow velocities reach sonic speeds at some location on  an aircraft (such as the area of maximum camber on the wing),  further acceleration results in the onset of compressibility  effects, such as shock wave formation, drag increase, buffeting,  stability, and control difficulties. Subsonic flow principles are  invalid at all speeds above this point.  [Figure 5-64]  

# Speed Ranges  

The speed of sound varies with temperature. Under standard  temperature conditions of   $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the speed of sound at sea  level is 661 knots. At 40,000 feet, where the temperature is   $-55~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  , the speed of sound decreases to 574 knots. In high-

Figure 5-64.  Wing airflow.  

speed flight and/or high-altitude flight, the measurement of  speed is expressed in terms of a “Mach number”—the ratio  of the true airspeed of the aircraft to the speed of sound in  the same atmospheric conditions. An aircraft traveling at  the speed of sound is traveling at Mach 1.0. Aircraft speed  regimes are defined approximately as follows:  

Subsonic—Mach numbers below 0.75 Transonic—Mach numbers from 0.75 to 1.20 Supersonic—Mach numbers from 1.20 to 5.00 Hypersonic—Mach numbers above 5.00  

While flights in the transonic and supersonic ranges are  common occurrences for military aircraft, civilian jet aircraft  normally operate in a cruise speed range of Mach 0.7 to  Mach 0.90.  

The speed of an aircraft in which airflow over any part of  the aircraft or structure under consideration first reaches  (but does not exceed) Mach 1.0 is termed “critical Mach  number” or “Mach Crit.” Thus, critical Mach number is  the boundary between subsonic and transonic flight and is  largely dependent on the wing and airfoil design. Critical  Mach number is an important point in transonic flight. When  shock waves form on the aircraft, airflow separation followed  by buffet and aircraft control difficulties can occur. Shock  waves, buffet, and airflow separation take place above critical  Mach number. A jet aircraft typically is most efficient when  cruising at or near its critical Mach number. At speeds 5–10  percent above the critical Mach number, compressibility  effects begin. Drag begins to rise sharply. Associated with  the “drag rise” are buffet, trim, and stability changes and a  decrease in control surface effectiveness. This is the point  of “drag divergence.”  [Figure 5-65]  

$\mathrm{V_{MO}/M_{M O}}$   is defined as the maximum operating limit speed. 

  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$   is expressed in knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS), while   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   is expressed in Mach number. The  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$   limit is usually  associated with operations at lower altitudes and deals with  structural loads and flutter. The  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   limit is associated with  operations at higher altitudes and is usually more concerned  with compressibility effects and flutter. At lower altitudes,  structural loads and flutter are of concern; at higher altitudes,  compressibility effects and flutter are of concern.  

Adherence to these speeds prevents structural problems due  to dynamic pressure or flutter, degradation in aircraft control  response due to compressibility effects (e.g., Mach Tuck,  aileron reversal, or buzz), and separated airflow due to shock  waves resulting in loss of lift or vibration and buffet. Any of  these phenomena could prevent the pilot from being able to  adequately control the aircraft.  

For example, an early civilian jet aircraft had a  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$   limit of  306 KCAS up to approximately FL 310 (on a standard day).  At this altitude (FL 310), an  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   of 0.82 was approximately  equal to 306 KCAS. Above this altitude, an   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   of 0.82  always equaled a KCAS less than   $306~\mathrm{KCAS}$   and, thus,  became the operating limit as you could not reach the  $\mathrm{V_{MO}}$  limit without first reaching the   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   limit. For example, at  FL 380, an  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   of 0.82 is equal to 261 KCAS.  

# Mach Number Versus Airspeed  

It is important to understand how airspeed varies with Mach  number. As an example, consider how the stall speed of a  jet transport aircraft varies with an increase in altitude. The  increase in altitude results in a corresponding drop in air  density and outside temperature. Suppose this jet transport  is in the clean configuration (gear and flaps up) and weighs  550,000 pounds. The aircraft might stall at approximately 152  KCAS at sea level. This is equal to (on a standard day) a true  velocity of 152 KTAS and a Mach number of 0.23. At FL 380,  the aircraft will still stall at approximately 152 KCAS, but the  true velocity is about 287 KTAS with a Mach number of 0.50.  

![](images/628605f2bc6f02a772231d04d03fda03261f4cce306b783e4df7059ff30d72b2.jpg)  
Figure 5-65.  Critical Mach.  

Although the stalling speed has remained the same for our  purposes, both the Mach number and TAS have increased.  With increasing altitude, the air density has decreased; this  requires a faster true airspeed in order to have the same  pressure sensed by the pitot tube for the same KCAS, or KIAS  (for our purposes, KCAS and KIAS are relatively close to  each other). The dynamic pressure the wing experiences at  FL 380 at 287 KTAS is the same as at sea level at 152 KTAS.  However, it is flying at higher Mach number.  

Another factor to consider is the speed of sound. A decrease  in temperature in a gas results in a decrease in the speed of  sound. Thus, as the aircraft climbs in altitude with outside  temperature dropping, the speed of sound is dropping. At  sea level, the speed of sound is approximately 661 KCAS,  while at FL 380 it is 574 KCAS. Thus, for our jet transport  aircraft, the stall speed (in KTAS) has gone from 152 at sea  level to 287 at FL 380. Simultaneously, the speed of sound  (in KCAS) has decreased from 661 to 574 and the Mach  number has increased from 0.23 (152 KTAS divided by 661  KTAS) to 0.50 (287 KTAS divided by 574 KTAS). All the  while, the KCAS for stall has remained constant at 152. This  describes what happens when the aircraft is at a constant  KCAS with increasing altitude, but what happens when the  pilot keeps Mach constant during the climb? In normal jet  flight operations, the climb is at 250 KIAS (or higher (e.g.  heavy)) to 10,000 feet and then at a specified en route climb  airspeed (about 330 if a DC10) until reaching an altitude in  the “mid-twenties” where the pilot then climbs at a constant  Mach number to cruise altitude.  

Assuming for illustration purposes that the pilot climbs at a   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   of 0.82 from sea level up to FL 380. KCAS goes from  543 to 261. The KIAS at each altitude would follow the  same behavior and just differ by a few knots. Recall from  the earlier discussion that the speed of sound is decreasing  with the drop in temperature as the aircraft climbs. The Mach  number is simply the ratio of the true airspeed to the speed  of sound at flight conditions. The significance of this is that  at a constant Mach number climb, the KCAS (and KTAS or  KIAS as well) is falling off.  

If the aircraft climbed high enough at this constant   $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$  with decreasing KIAS, KCAS, and KTAS, it would begin to  approach its stall speed. At some point, the stall speed of the  aircraft in Mach number could equal the  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$   of the aircraft,  and the pilot could neither slow down (without stalling) nor  speed up (without exceeding the max operating speed of the  aircraft). This has been dubbed the “coffin corner.”  

# Boundary Layer  

The viscous nature of airflow reduces the local velocities on  a surface and is responsible for skin friction. As discussed  earlier in the chapter, the layer of air over the wing’s surface  that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity is the boundary  layer. There are two different types of boundary layer flow:  laminar and turbulent.  

# Laminar Boundary Layer Flow  

The laminar boundary layer is a very smooth flow, while  the turbulent boundary layer contains swirls or eddies.  The laminar flow creates less skin friction drag than the  turbulent flow but is less stable. Boundary layer flow over a  wing surface begins as a smooth laminar flow. As the flow  continues back from the leading edge, the laminar boundary  layer increases in thickness.  

# Turbulent Boundary Layer Flow  

At some distance back from the leading edge, the smooth  laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow.  From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition  from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as  possible or have a large amount of the wing surface within  the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy  laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly  than the turbulent layer.  

# Boundary Layer Separation  

Another phenomenon associated with viscous flow is  separation. Separation occurs when the airflow breaks away  from an airfoil. The natural progression is from laminar  boundary layer to turbulent boundary layer and then to  airflow separation. Airflow separation produces high drag  and ultimately destroys lift. The boundary layer separation  point moves forward on the wing as the AOA is increased.  [Figure 5-66]  

Vortex generators are used to delay or prevent shock wave  induced boundary layer separation encountered in transonic  flight. They are small low aspect ratio airfoils placed at a  $12^{\circ}$    to   $15^{\circ}$   AOA to the airstream. Usually spaced a few inches  apart along the wing ahead of the ailerons or other control  surfaces, vortex generators create a vortex that mixes the  boundary airflow with the high energy airflow just above the  surface. This produces higher surface velocities and increases  the energy of the boundary layer. Thus, a stronger shock wave  is necessary to produce airflow separation.  

# Shock Waves  

When an airplane flies at subsonic speeds, the air ahead is  “warned” of the airplane’s coming by a pressure change  transmitted ahead of the airplane at the speed of sound.  Because of this warning, the air begins to move aside before  the airplane arrives and is prepared to let it pass easily. When  the airplane’s speed reaches the speed of sound, the pressure  

![](images/8d190983eed3656967e6a4873e2a544ab98a0920b222510a5850059b44f9624e.jpg)  
Figure 5-66.  Boundary layer.  

change can no longer warn the air ahead because the airplane  is keeping up with its own pressure waves. Rather, the air  particles pile up in front of the airplane causing a sharp  decrease in the flow velocity directly in front of the airplane  with a corresponding increase in air pressure and density.  

As the airplane’s speed increases beyond the speed of sound,  the pressure and density of the compressed air ahead of it  increase, the area of compression extending some distance  ahead of the airplane. At some point in the airstream, the air  particles are completely undisturbed, having had no advanced  warning of the airplane’s approach, and in the next instant the  same air particles are forced to undergo sudden and drastic  changes in temperature, pressure, density, and velocity.  The boundary between the undisturbed air and the region  of compressed air is called a shock or “compression” wave.  This same type of wave is formed whenever a supersonic  airstream is slowed to subsonic without a change in direction,  such as when the airstream is accelerated to sonic speed  over the cambered portion of a wing, and then decelerated  to subsonic speed as the area of maximum camber is passed.  A shock wave forms as a boundary between the supersonic  and subsonic ranges.  

Whenever a shock wave forms perpendicular to the airflow, it  is termed a “normal” shock wave, and the flow immediately  behind the wave is subsonic. A supersonic airstream passing  through a normal shock wave experiences these changes:  

•	 The airstream is slowed to subsonic. •	 The airflow immediately behind the shock wave does  not change direction. •	 The static pressure and density of the airstream behind  the wave is greatly increased.  • 	 The energy of the airstream (indicated by total  pressure—dynamic plus static) is greatly reduced.  

Shock wave formation causes an increase in drag. One of  the principal effects of a shock wave is the formation of a  dense high pressure region immediately behind the wave.  The instability of the high pressure region, and the fact that  part of the velocity energy of the airstream is converted to  heat as it flows through the wave, is a contributing factor  in the drag increase, but the drag resulting from airflow  separation is much greater. If the shock wave is strong,  the boundary layer may not have sufficient kinetic energy  to withstand airflow separation. The drag incurred in the  transonic region due to shock wave formation and airflow  separation is known as “wave drag.” When speed exceeds  the critical Mach number by about 10 percent, wave drag  increases sharply. A considerable increase in thrust (power)  is required to increase flight speed beyond this point into the  supersonic range where, depending on the airfoil shape and  the AOA, the boundary layer may reattach.  

Normal shock waves form on the wing’s upper surface and  form an additional area of supersonic flow and a normal shock  wave on the lower surface. As flight speed approaches the  speed of sound, the areas of supersonic flow enlarge and the  shock waves move nearer the trailing edge.  [Figure 5-67]

Figure 5-67.  Shock waves.  

Associated with “drag rise” are buffet (known as Mach  buffet), trim, and stability changes and a decrease in control  force effectiveness. The loss of lift due to airflow separation  results in a loss of downwash and a change in the position of  the center pressure on the wing. Airflow separation produces  a turbulent wake behind the wing, which causes the tail  surfaces to buffet (vibrate). The nose-up and nose-down pitch  control provided by the horizontal tail is dependent on the  downwash behind the wing. Thus, an increase in downwash  decreases the horizontal tail’s pitch control effectiveness  since it effectively increases the AOA that the tail surface is  seeing. Movement of the wing CP affects the wing pitching  moment. If the CP moves aft, a diving moment referred to  as “Mach tuck” or “tuck under” is produced, and if it moves  forward, a nose-up moment is produced. This is the primary  reason for the development of the T-tail configuration on  many turbine-powered aircraft, which places the horizontal  stabilizer as far as practical from the turbulence of the wings.  

# Sweepback  

Most of the difficulties of transonic flight are associated with  shock wave induced flow separation. Therefore, any means of  delaying or alleviating the shock induced separation improves  aerodynamic performance. One method is wing sweepback.  Sweepback theory is based upon the concept that it is only the  component of the airflow perpendicular to the leading edge  of the wing that affects pressure distribution and formation  of shock waves.  [Figure 5-68]  

On a straight wing aircraft, the airflow strikes the wing  leading edge at  $90^{\circ}$  , and its full impact produces pressure and  lift. A wing with sweepback is struck by the same airflow at  an angle smaller than  $90^{\circ}$  . This airflow on the swept wing has  the effect of persuading the wing into believing that it is flying  slower than it really is; thus the formation of shock waves is  delayed. Advantages of wing sweep include an increase in  critical Mach number, force divergence Mach number, and  the Mach number at which drag rise peaks. In other words,  sweep delays the onset of compressibility effects.  

The Mach number that produces a sharp change in coefficient  of drag is termed the “force divergence” Mach number and,  for most airfoils, usually exceeds the critical Mach number by  5 to 10 percent. At this speed, the airflow separation induced  by shock wave formation can create significant variations in  the drag, lift, or pitching moment coefficients. In addition to  the delay of the onset of compressibility effects, sweepback  reduces the magnitude in the changes of drag, lift, or moment  coefficients. In other words, the use of sweepback “softens”  the force divergence.  

A disadvantage of swept wings is that they tend to stall at the  wingtips rather than at the wing roots.  [Figure 5-69]  This is  

![](images/fbaa7fdb55d4697d326cca30cd8bf84ced0fcf2560e76b8f0b37063c3a9d65ba.jpg)  
Figure 5-68.  Sweepback effect.  

because the boundary layer tends to flow spanwise toward  the tips and to separate near the leading edges. Because the  tips of a swept wing are on the aft part of the wing (behind  the CL), a wingtip stall causes the CL to move forward on  the wing, forcing the nose to rise further. The tendency for  tip stall is greatest when wing sweep and taper are combined.  

The stall situation can be aggravated by a T-tail configuration,  which affords little or no pre-stall warning in the form of tail  control surface buffet.  [Figure 5-70]  The T-tail, being above  the wing wake remains effective even after the wing has begun  to stall, allowing the pilot to inadvertently drive the wing  into a deeper stall at a much greater AOA. If the horizontal  tail surfaces then become buried in the wing’s wake, the  elevator may lose all effectiveness, making it impossible to  reduce pitch attitude and break the stall. In the pre-stall and  immediate post-stall regimes, the lift/drag qualities of a swept  wing aircraft (specifically the enormous increase in drag  at low speeds) can cause an increasingly descending flight  path with no change in pitch attitude, further increasing the  

![](images/82fd852425c354c18b56e042f9c2de6152919f430791961fbdb7f2b82488d870.jpg)

AOA. In this situation, without reliable AOA information,  a nose-down pitch attitude with an increasing airspeed is no  guarantee that recovery has been affected, and up-elevator  movement at this stage may merely keep the aircraft stalled.  

It is a characteristic of T-tail aircraft to pitch up viciously  when stalled in extreme nose-high attitudes, making  recovery difficult or violent. The stick pusher inhibits this  type of stall. At approximately one knot above stall speed,  pre-programmed stick forces automatically move the stick  forward, preventing the stall from developing. A G-limiter  may also be incorporated into the system to prevent the pitch  down generated by the stick pusher from imposing excessive  loads on the aircraft. A “stick shaker,” on the other hand,  provides stall warning when the airspeed is five to seven  percent above stall speed.  

# Mach Buffet Boundaries  

Mach buffet is a function of the speed of the airflow over the  wing—not necessarily the speed of the aircraft. Any time that  too great a lift demand is made on the wing, whether from too  fast an airspeed or from too high an AOA near the  $\bf{M}_{\mathrm{{MO}}}$  , the  “high-speed” buffet occurs. There are also occasions when  the buffet can be experienced at much lower speeds known  as the “low-speed Mach buffet.”  

An aircraft flown at a speed too slow for its weight and  altitude necessitating a high AOA is the most likely situation  to cause a low-speed Mach buffet. This very high AOA has  the effect of increasing airflow velocity over the upper surface  of the wing until the same effects of the shock waves and  buffet occur as in the high-speed buffet situation. The AOA  of the wing has the greatest effect on inducing the Mach  buffet at either the high-speed or low-speed boundaries for  the aircraft. The conditions that increase the AOA, the speed  of the airflow over the wing, and chances of Mach buffet are:  

•	 High altitudes—the higher an aircraft flies, the thinner  the air and the greater the AOA required to produce  the lift needed to maintain level flight. •	 Heavy weights—the heavier the aircraft, the greater  the lift required of the wing, and all other factors being  equal, the greater the AOA. •	 G loading—an increase in the G loading on the aircraft  has the same effect as increasing the weight of the  aircraft. Whether the increase in G forces is caused  by turns, rough control usage, or turbulence, the effect  of increasing the wing’s AOA is the same.  

# High Speed Flight Controls  

On high-speed aircraft, flight controls are divided into  primary flight controls and secondary or auxiliary flight  controls. The primary flight controls maneuver the aircraft  about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes. They include the ailerons,  elevator, and rudder. Secondary or auxiliary flight controls  include tabs, leading edge flaps, trailing edge flaps, spoilers,  and slats.  

Spoilers are used on the upper surface of the wing to spoil or  reduce lift. High speed aircraft, due to their clean low drag  design, use spoilers as speed brakes to slow them down.  Spoilers are extended immediately after touchdown to dump  lift and thus transfer the weight of the aircraft from the wings  onto the wheels for better braking performance.  [Figure 5-71]  

Jet transport aircraft have small ailerons. The space for  ailerons is limited because as much of the wing trailing  edge as possible is needed for flaps. Also, a conventional  size aileron would cause wing twist at high speed. For that  reason, spoilers are used in unison with ailerons to provide  additional roll control.  

Some jet transports have two sets of ailerons, a pair of outboard  low-speed ailerons and a pair of high-speed inboard ailerons.  When the flaps are fully retracted after takeoff, the outboard  ailerons are automatically locked out in the faired position.  

When used for roll control, the spoiler on the side of the  up-going aileron extends and reduces the lift on that side,  causing the wing to drop. If the spoilers are extended as speed  brakes, they can still be used for roll control. If they are the  

![](images/ef5fc8b932480e85601f3317ad66400566de33d1fe589d3c7cd18db4e6246f52.jpg)

differential type, they extend further on one side and retract  on the other side. If they are the non-differential type, they  extend further on one side but do not retract on the other side.  When fully extended as speed brakes, the non-differential  spoilers remain extended and do not supplement the ailerons.  

To obtain a smooth stall and a higher AOA without airflow  separation, the wing’s leading edge should have a well- rounded almost blunt shape that the airflow can adhere to  at the higher AOA. With this shape, the airflow separation  starts at the trailing edge and progresses forward gradually  as AOA is increased.  

around the wing leading edge. The airflow tends to tear loose  rather suddenly from the upper surface at a moderate AOA.  To utilize trailing edge flaps, and thus increase the  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  -MAX the wing must go to a higher AOA without airflow separation.  Therefore, leading edge slots, slats, and flaps are used to  improve the low-speed characteristics during takeoff, climb,  and landing. Although these devices are not as powerful as  trailing edge flaps, they are effective when used full span in  combination with high-lift trailing edge flaps. With the aid  of these sophisticated high-lift devices, airflow separation is  delayed and the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}}$   is increased considerably. In fact, a  50 knot reduction in stall speed is not uncommon.  

The pointed leading edge necessary for high-speed flight  results in an abrupt stall and restricts the use of trailing edge  flaps because the airflow cannot follow the sharp curve  The operational requirements of a large jet transport aircraft  necessitate large pitch trim changes. Some requirements are:  

•	 A large CG range •	 A large speed range •	 The ability to perform large trim changes due to  wing leading edge and trailing edge high-lift devices  without limiting the amount of elevator remaining •	 Maintaining trim drag to a minimum  

# Chapter Summary  

In order to sustain an aircraft in flight, a pilot must understand  how thrust, drag, lift, and weight act on the aircraft. By  understanding the aerodynamics of flight, how design,  weight, load factors, and gravity affect an aircraft during  flight maneuvers from stalls to high speed flight, the pilot  learns how to control the balance between these forces. For  information on stall speeds, load factors, and other important  aircraft data, always consult the AFM/POH for specific  information pertaining to the aircraft being flown.  

These requirements are met by the use of a variable incidence  horizontal stabilizer. Large trim changes on a fixed-tail  aircraft require large elevator deflections. At these large  deflections, little further elevator movement remains in the  same direction. A variable incidence horizontal stabilizer  is designed to take out the trim changes. The stabilizer is  larger than the elevator, and consequently does not need to  be moved through as large an angle. This leaves the elevator  streamlining the tail plane with a full range of movement up  and down. The variable incidence horizontal stabilizer can  be set to handle the bulk of the pitch control demand, with  the elevator handling the rest. On aircraft equipped with a  variable incidence horizontal stabilizer, the elevator is smaller  and less effective in isolation than it is on a fixed-tail aircraft.  In comparison to other flight controls, the variable incidence  horizontal stabilizer is enormously powerful in its effect.  

Because of the size and high speeds of jet transport aircraft,  the forces required to move the control surfaces can be beyond  the strength of the pilot. Consequently, the control surfaces are  actuated by hydraulic or electrical power units. Moving the  controls in the flight deck signals the control angle required,  and the power unit positions the actual control surface. In the  event of complete power unit failure, movement of the control  surface can be affected by manually controlling the control  tabs. Moving the control tab upsets the aerodynamic balance,  which causes the control surface to move.  

# Chapter 6 Flight Controls  

# Introduction  

This chapter focuses on the flight control systems a pilot uses  to control the forces of flight and the aircraft’s direction and  attitude. It should be noted that flight control systems and  characteristics can vary greatly depending on the type of  aircraft flown. The most basic flight control system designs  are mechanical and date back to early aircraft. They operate  with a collection of mechanical parts, such as rods, cables,  pulleys, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces of the  flight deck controls to the control surfaces. Mechanical flight  control systems are still used today in small general and  sport category aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not  excessive.  [Figure 6-1]  

![](images/c3ba764f0db27be4bcfd038280e8552b400ca34efc01c11e2d643e52bafffa2a.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.   Mechanical flight control system.  

As aviation matured and aircraft designers learned more about  aerodynamics, the industry produced larger and faster aircraft.  Therefore, the aerodynamic forces acting upon the control  surfaces increased exponentially. To make the control force  required by pilots manageable, aircraft engineers designed  more complex systems. At first, hydromechanical designs,  consisting of a mechanical circuit and a hydraulic circuit,  were used to reduce the complexity, weight, and limitations  of mechanical flight controls systems.  [Figure 6-2]  

As aircraft became more sophisticated, the control surfaces  were actuated by electric motors, digital computers, or fiber  optic cables. Called “fly-by-wire,” this flight control system  replaces the physical connection between pilot controls and  the flight control surfaces with an electrical interface. In  addition, in some large and fast aircraft, controls are boosted  by hydraulically or electrically actuated systems. In both  the fly-by-wire and boosted controls, the feel of the control  reaction is fed back to the pilot by simulated means.  

Current research at the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center  involves Intelligent Flight Control Systems (IFCS). The goal  

![](images/d8c391858763c55892f7bb518617c9a2ffe4bbdccf6ff7f3b4a0f5363b8865db.jpg)

of this project is to develop an adaptive neural network-based  flight control system. Applied directly to flight control system  feedback errors, IFCS provides adjustments to improve  aircraft performance in normal flight, as well as with system  failures. With IFCS, a pilot is able to maintain control and  safely land an aircraft that has suffered a failure to a control  surface or damage to the airframe. It also improves mission  capability, increases the reliability and safety of flight, and  eases the pilot workload.  

Today’s aircraft employ a variety of flight control systems.  For example, some aircraft in the sport pilot category rely on  weight-shift control to fly while balloons use a standard burn  technique. Helicopters utilize a cyclic to tilt the rotor in the  desired direction along with a collective to manipulate rotor  pitch and anti-torque pedals to control yaw.  [Figure 6-3]  

For additional information on flight control systems, refer  to the appropriate handbook for information related to the  flight control systems and characteristics of specific types  of aircraft.  

# Flight Control Systems  

# Flight Controls  

Aircraft flight control systems consist of primary and  secondary systems. The ailerons, elevator (or stabilator),  and rudder constitute the primary control system and are  required to control an aircraft safely during flight. Wing flaps,  leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems constitute  the secondary control system and improve the performance  characteristics of the airplane or relieve the pilot of excessive  control forces.  

# Primary Flight Controls  

Aircraft control systems are carefully designed to provide  adequate responsiveness to control inputs while allowing a  

![](images/4b107e37ffcba0184e733db75e69698084ebd113e21e3dee76a6086c47d16dcd.jpg)  
Figure 6-3.   Helicopter flight control system.  

natural feel. At low airspeeds, the controls usually feel soft  and sluggish, and the aircraft responds slowly to control  applications. At higher airspeeds, the controls become  increasingly firm and aircraft response is more rapid.  

Movement of any of the three primary flight control surfaces  (ailerons, elevator or stabilator, or rudder), changes the  airflow and pressure distribution over and around the airfoil.  These changes affect the lift and drag produced by the airfoil/ control surface combination, and allow a pilot to control the  aircraft about its three axes of rotation.  

Design features limit the amount of deflection of flight  control surfaces. For example, control-stop mechanisms may  be incorporated into the flight control linkages, or movement  of the control column and/or rudder pedals may be limited.  The purpose of these design limits is to prevent the pilot from  inadvertently overcontrolling and overstressing the aircraft  during normal maneuvers.  

A properly designed aircraft is stable and easily controlled  during normal maneuvering. Control surface inputs cause  movement about the three axes of rotation. The types of  stability an aircraft exhibits also relate to the three axes of  rotation.  [Figure 6-4]  

![](images/cf883d6f4b884883dec6a93e60e9f059cda4f1c6325592e2a2bafc0975d0019a.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.   Airplane controls, movement, axes of rotation, and  type of stability.  

# Ailerons  

Ailerons control roll about the longitudinal axis. The ailerons  are attached to the outboard trailing edge of each wing and  move in the opposite direction from each other. Ailerons are  connected by cables, bellcranks, pulleys, and/or push-pull  tubes to a control wheel or control stick.  

Moving the control wheel, or control stick, to the right  causes the right aileron to deflect upward and the left aileron  to deflect downward. The upward deflection of the right  aileron decreases the camber resulting in decreased lift on  the right wing. The corresponding downward deflection of  the left aileron increases the camber resulting in increased  lift on the left wing. Thus, the increased lift on the left wing  and the decreased lift on the right wing causes the aircraft  to roll to the right.  

# Adverse Yaw  

Since the downward deflected aileron produces more lift as  evidenced by the wing raising, it also produces more drag.  This added drag causes the wing to slow down slightly.  This results in the aircraft yawing toward the wing which  had experienced an increase in lift (and drag). From the  pilot’s perspective, the yaw is opposite the direction of the  bank. The adverse yaw is a result of differential drag and the  slight difference in the velocity of the left and right wings.  [Figure 6-5]  

Adverse yaw becomes more pronounced at low airspeeds.  At these slower airspeeds, aerodynamic pressure on control  surfaces are low, and larger control inputs are required to  

![](images/1e2e35a54f981a0f9b758ddece02e5a72d63f35322083399b49f7b1ab716e85a.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.   Adverse yaw is caused by higher drag on the outside  wing that is producing more lift.  

effectively maneuver the aircraft. As a result, the increase  in aileron deflection causes an increase in adverse yaw. The  yaw is especially evident in aircraft with long wing spans.  

Application of the rudder is used to counteract adverse  yaw. The amount of rudder control required is greatest at  low airspeeds, high angles of attack, and with large aileron  deflections. Like all control surfaces at lower airspeeds,  the vertical stabilizer/rudder becomes less effective and  magnifies the control problems associated with adverse yaw.  

All turns are coordinated by use of ailerons, rudder, and  elevator. Applying aileron pressure is necessary to place  the aircraft in the desired angle of bank, while simultaneous  application of rudder pressure is necessary to counteract the  resultant adverse yaw. Additionally, because more lift is  required during a turn than during straight-and-level flight,  the angle of attack (AOA) must be increased by applying  elevator back pressure. The steeper the turn, the more elevator  back pressure that is needed.  

As the desired angle of bank is established, aileron and  rudder pressures should be relaxed. This stops the angle of  bank from increasing, because the aileron and rudder control  surfaces are in a neutral and streamlined position. Elevator  back pressure should be held constant to maintain altitude.  The roll-out from a turn is similar to the roll-in, except the  flight controls are applied in the opposite direction. The  aileron and rudder are applied in the direction of the roll-out  or toward the high wing. As the angle of bank decreases,  the elevator back pressure should be relaxed as necessary  to maintain altitude.  

In an attempt to reduce the effects of adverse yaw,  manufacturers have engineered four systems: differential  ailerons, frise-type ailerons, coupled ailerons and rudder,  and flaperons.  

# Differential Ailerons  

With differential ailerons, one aileron is raised a greater  distance than the other aileron and is lowered for a given  movement of the control wheel or control stick. This produces  an increase in drag on the descending wing. The greater drag  results from deflecting the up aileron on the descending wing  to a greater angle than the down aileron on the rising wing.  While adverse yaw is reduced, it is not eliminated completely.  [Figure 6-6]  

# Frise-Type Ailerons  

With a frise-type aileron, when pressure is applied to the  control wheel, or control stick, the aileron that is being raised  pivots on an offset hinge. This projects the leading edge of  the aileron into the airflow and creates drag. It helps equalize  

![](images/f25e0e0b56973f85f02de3376558741dab695d565a186569eefdfbe1b8c6dc73.jpg)  
Figure 6-6 .  Differential ailerons.  

the drag created by the lowered aileron on the opposite wing  and reduces adverse yaw.  [Figure 6-7]  

The frise-type aileron also forms a slot so air flows smoothly  over the lowered aileron, making it more effective at high  angles of attack. Frise-type ailerons may also be designed  to function differentially. Like the differential aileron, the  frise-type aileron does not eliminate adverse yaw entirely.  Coordinated rudder application is still needed when ailerons  are applied.  

# Coupled Ailerons and Rudder  

Coupled ailerons and rudder are linked controls. This is  accomplished with rudder-aileron interconnect springs, which  help correct for aileron drag by automatically deflecting  the rudder at the same time the ailerons are deflected. For  

![](images/b5e8faec83f3b7b7a950fac515e495bd78719f656f58dbbad42ff82527232c35.jpg)  
Figure 6-7.   Frise-type ailerons.  

example, when the control wheel, or control stick, is moved  to produce a left roll, the interconnect cable and spring pulls  forward on the left rudder pedal just enough to prevent the  nose of the aircraft from yawing to the right. The force applied  to the rudder by the springs can be overridden if it becomes  necessary to slip the aircraft.  [Figure 6-8]  

# Flaperons  

Flaperons combine both aspects of flaps and ailerons. In  addition to controlling the bank angle of an aircraft like  conventional ailerons, flaperons can be lowered together  to function much the same as a dedicated set of flaps. The  pilot retains separate controls for ailerons and flaps. A mixer  is used to combine the separate pilot inputs into this single  set of control surfaces called flaperons. Many designs that  incorporate flaperons mount the control surfaces away from  the wing to provide undisturbed airflow at high angles of  attack and/or low airspeeds.  [Figure 6-9]  

# Elevator  

The elevator controls pitch about the lateral axis. Like the  ailerons on small aircraft, the elevator is connected to the  control column in the flight deck by a series of mechanical  

![](images/2e753b3c51b01db905e8afb41c6a70d222aa26e13bc85d379580658e5cfe6b32.jpg)

Figure 6-9.   Flaperons on a Skystar Kitfox MK 7.  

linkages. Aft movement of the control column deflects  the trailing edge of the elevator surface up. This is usually  referred to as the up-elevator position.  [Figure 6-10]  

The up-elevator position decreases the camber of the elevator  and creates a downward aerodynamic force, which is greater  than the normal tail-down force that exists in straight-and- level flight. The overall effect causes the tail of the aircraft  to move down and the nose to pitch up. The pitching moment  occurs about the center of gravity (CG). The strength of the  pitching moment is determined by the distance between  the CG and the horizontal tail surface, as well as by the  aerodynamic effectiveness of the horizontal tail surface.  Moving the control column forward has the opposite effect.  In this case, elevator camber increases, creating more lift  (less tail-down force) on the horizontal stabilizer/elevator.  This moves the tail upward and pitches the nose down. Again,  the pitching moment occurs about the CG.  

As mentioned earlier, stability, power, thrustline, and the  position of the horizontal tail surfaces on the empennage  are factors in elevator effectiveness controlling pitch. For  

![](images/364b9d818d2608af564e1eaa69fdcebe5365f40df4cd7f6ed8a19ab35ae9d861.jpg)  
Figure 6-10.  The elevator is the primary control for changing the  pitch attitude of an aircraft.  

example, the horizontal tail surfaces may be attached near  the lower part of the vertical stabilizer, at the midpoint, or  at the high point, as in the T-tail design.  

# T-Tail  

In a T-tail configuration, the elevator is above most of the  effects of downwash from the propeller, as well as airflow  around the fuselage and/or wings during normal flight  conditions. Operation of the elevators in this undisturbed air  allows control movements that are consistent throughout most  flight regimes. T-tail designs have become popular on many  light and large aircraft, especially those with aft fuselage- mounted engines because the T-tail configuration removes  the tail from the exhaust blast of the engines. Seaplanes and  amphibians often have T-tails in order to keep the horizontal  surfaces as far from the water as possible. An additional  benefit is reduced noise and vibration inside the aircraft.  

In comparison with conventional-tail aircraft, the elevator on a  T-tail aircraft must be moved a greater distance to raise the nose  a given amount when traveling at slow speeds. This is because  the conventional-tail aircraft has the downwash from the  propeller pushing down on the tail to assist in raising the nose.  

Aircraft controls are rigged so that an increase in control force  is required to increase control travel. The forces required to  raise the nose of a T-tail aircraft are greater than the forces  required to raise the nose of a conventional-tail aircraft.  Longitudinal stability of a trimmed aircraft is the same for  both types of configuration, but the pilot must be aware that  the required control forces are greater at slow speeds during  takeoffs, landings, or stalls than for similar size aircraft  equipped with conventional tails.  

T-tail aircraft also require additional design considerations  to counter the problem of flutter. Since the weight of the  horizontal surfaces is at the top of the vertical stabilizer, the  moment arm created causes high loads on the vertical stabilizer  that can result in flutter. Engineers must compensate for this by  increasing the design stiffness of the vertical stabilizer, usually  resulting in a weight penalty over conventional tail designs.  

When flying at a very high AOA with a low airspeed and  an aft CG, the T-tail aircraft may be more susceptible to a  deep stall. In this condition, the wake of the wing impinges  on the tail surface and renders it almost ineffective. The  wing, if fully stalled, allows its airflow to separate right after  the leading edge. The wide wake of decelerated, turbulent  air blankets the horizontal tail and hence its effectiveness  diminished significantly. In these circumstances, elevator or  stabilator control is reduced (or perhaps eliminated) making  it difficult to recover from the stall.  It should be noted that an  aft CG is often a contributing factor in these incidents, since  similar recovery problems are also found with conventional  tail aircraft with an aft CG.  [Figure 6-11]  Deep stalls can  occur on any aircraft but are more likely to occur on aircraft  with “T” tails as a high AOA may be more likely to place  the wings separated airflow into the path of the horizontal  surface of the tail.  Additionally, the distance between the  wings and the tail, the position of the engines (such as being  mounted on the tail) may increase the susceptibility of deep  stall events.  Therefore a deep stall may be more prevalent  on transport versus general aviation aircraft.  

Since flight at a high AOA with a low airspeed and an aft  CG position can be dangerous, many aircraft have systems to  compensate for this situation. The systems range from control  stops to elevator down springs. On transport category jets, stick  pushers are commonly used. An elevator down spring assists in  lowering the nose of the aircraft to prevent a stall caused by the  aft CG position. The stall occurs because the properly trimmed  airplane is flying with the elevator in a trailing edge down  position, forcing the tail up and the nose down. In this unstable  condition, if the aircraft encounters turbulence and slows down  further, the trim tab no longer positions the elevator in the nose- down position. The elevator then streamlines, and the nose of  the aircraft pitches upward, possibly resulting in a stall.  

The elevator down spring produces a mechanical load on the  elevator, causing it to move toward the nose-down position if not  otherwise balanced. The elevator trim tab balances the elevator  down spring to position the elevator in a trimmed position.  When the trim tab becomes ineffective, the down spring drives  the elevator to a nose-down position. The nose of the aircraft  lowers, speed builds up, and a stall is prevented.  [Figure 6-12]  

The elevator must also have sufficient authority to hold the  nose of the aircraft up during the roundout for a landing. In  this case, a forward CG may cause a problem. During the  landing flare, power is usually reduced, which decreases the

airflow over the empennage. This, coupled with the reduced  landing speed, makes the elevator less effective.  

As this discussion demonstrates, pilots must understand and  follow proper loading procedures, particularly with regard  to the CG position. More information on aircraft loading,  as well as weight and balance, is included in Chapter 10,  Weight and Balance.  

# Stabilator  

As mentioned in Chapter 3, Aircraft Structure, a stabilator is  essentially a one-piece horizontal stabilizer that pivots from  a central hinge point. When the control column is pulled  back, it raises the stabilator’s trailing edge, pulling the nose  of the aircraft. Pushing the control column forward lowers  the trailing edge of the stabilator and pitches the nose of the  aircraft down.  

Because stabilators pivot around a central hinge point, they  are extremely sensitive to control inputs and aerodynamic  loads. Antiservo tabs are incorporated on the trailing edge to  decrease sensitivity. They deflect in the same direction as the  stabilator. This results in an increase in the force required to  move the stabilator, thus making it less prone to pilot-induced  overcontrolling. In addition, a balance weight is usually  incorporated in front of the main spar. The balance weight  may project into the empennage or may be incorporated on  the forward portion of the stabilator tips.  [Figure 6-13]  

# Canard  

The canard design utilizes the concept of two lifting surfaces.  The canard functions as a horizontal stabilizer located in front  

![](images/83548fb629c8d9480ce80001aeb78090f7745900e659be05f00762e1219e61c0.jpg)  
Figure 6-13.   The stabilator is a one-piece horizontal tail surface  that pivots up and down about a central hinge point.  

of the main wings. In effect, the canard is an airfoil similar to  the horizontal surface on a conventional aft-tail design. The  difference is that the canard actually creates lift and holds  the nose up, as opposed to the aft-tail design which exerts  downward force on the tail to prevent the nose from rotating  downward.  [Figure 6-14]  

The canard design dates back to the pioneer days of aviation.  Most notably, it was used on the Wright Flyer. Recently, the  canard configuration has regained popularity and is appearing  on newer aircraft. Canard designs include two types–one with  a horizontal surface of about the same size as a normal aft-tail  design, and the other with a surface of the same approximate  size and airfoil of the aft-mounted wing known as a tandem  wing configuration. Theoretically, the canard is considered  more efficient because using the horizontal surface to help  lift the weight of the aircraft should result in less drag for a  given amount of lift.  

![](images/dfadea22d75ab857a953587d2154284ad3a2eee7d78531151dd2526c6128e47a.jpg)  
Figure 6-14.   The Piaggio P180 includes a variable-sweep canard  design that provides longitudinal stability about the lateral axis.  

# Rudder  

The rudder controls movement of the aircraft about its vertical  axis. This motion is called yaw. Like the other primary control  surfaces, the rudder is a movable surface hinged to a fixed  surface in this case, to the vertical stabilizer or fin. The rudder  is controlled by the left and right rudder pedals.  

When the rudder is deflected into the airflow, a horizontal  force is exerted in the opposite direction.  [Figure 6-15]  By  pushing the left pedal, the rudder moves left. This alters the  airflow around the vertical stabilizer/rudder and creates a  sideward lift that moves the tail to the right and yaws the nose  of the airplane to the left. Rudder effectiveness increases with  speed; therefore, large deflections at low speeds and small  deflections at high speeds may be required to provide the  desired reaction. In propeller-driven aircraft, any slipstream  flowing over the rudder increases its effectiveness.  

# V-Tail  

The V-tail design utilizes two slanted tail surfaces to perform  the same functions as the surfaces of a conventional elevator  and rudder configuration. The fixed surfaces act as both  horizontal and vertical stabilizers.  [Figure 6-16]  

The movable surfaces, which are usually called ruddervators,  are connected through a special linkage that allows the control  wheel to move both surfaces simultaneously. On the other  hand, displacement of the rudder pedals moves the surfaces  differentially, thereby providing directional control.  

When both rudder and elevator controls are moved by the  pilot, a control mixing mechanism moves each surface the  

![](images/aa6576b94d74a2ae4ff57b461eb0b4275e2488c7717a83287b39c33ab91105b4.jpg)

appropriate amount. The control system for the V-tail is more  complex than the control system for a conventional tail. In  addition, the V-tail design is more susceptible to Dutch roll  tendencies than a conventional tail, and total reduction in  drag is minimal.  

# Secondary Flight Controls  

Secondary flight control systems may consist of wing flaps,  leading edge devices, spoilers, and trim systems.  

# Flaps  

Flaps are the most common high-lift devices used on aircraft.  These surfaces, which are attached to the trailing edge of  the wing, increase both lift and induced drag for any given  AOA. Flaps allow a compromise between high cruising  speed and low landing speed because they may be extended  when needed and retracted into the wing’s structure when not  needed. There are four common types of flaps: plain, split,  slotted, and Fowler flaps.  [Figure 6-17]  

The plain flap is the simplest of the four types. It increases  the airfoil camber, resulting in a significant increase in the  coefficient of lift   $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}})$   at a given AOA. At the same time, it  greatly increases drag and moves the center of pressure (CP)  aft on the airfoil, resulting in a nose-down pitching moment.  

The split flap is deflected from the lower surface of the airfoil  and produces a slightly greater increase in lift than the plain  flap. More drag is created because of the turbulent air pattern  produced behind the airfoil. When fully extended, both plain  and split flaps produce high drag with little additional lift.  

The most popular flap on aircraft today is the slotted flap.  Variations of this design are used for small aircraft, as well  as for large ones. Slotted flaps increase the lift coefficient  significantly more than plain or split flaps. On small aircraft,  the hinge is located below the lower surface of the flap, and  when the flap is lowered, a duct forms between the flap well  in the wing and the leading edge of the flap. When the slotted  flap is lowered, high energy air from the lower surface is  ducted to the flap’s upper surface. The high energy air from  the slot accelerates the upper surface boundary layer and  delays airflow separation, providing a higher   $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  . Thus, the  slotted flap produces much greater increases in maximum  coefficient of lift   $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}})$   than the plain or split flap. While  there are many types of slotted flaps, large aircraft often  have double- and even triple-slotted flaps. These allow the  maximum increase in drag without the airflow over the flaps  separating and destroying the lift they produce.  

![](images/b3a9b5c05d8338b6ad13a37e2060edd0cd98971813d7a6e6af5756690979f162.jpg)  
Figure 6-17.   Five common types of flaps.  

Fowler flaps are a type of slotted flap. This flap design not  only changes the camber of the wing, it also increases the  wing area. Instead of rotating down on a hinge, it slides  backwards on tracks. In the first portion of its extension, it  increases the drag very little, but increases the lift a great  deal as it increases both the area and camber. Pilots should  be aware that flap extension may cause a nose-up or down  pitching moment, depending on the type of aircraft, which  the pilot will need to compensate for, usually with a trim  adjustment. As the extension continues, the flap deflects  downward. During the last portion of its travel, the flap  increases the drag with little additional increase in lift.  

# Leading Edge Devices  

High-lift devices also can be applied to the leading edge of  the airfoil. The most common types are fixed slots, movable  slats, leading edge flaps, and cuffs.  [Figure 6-18]  

Fixed slots direct airflow to the upper wing surface and delay  airflow separation at higher angles of attack. The slot does not  

![](images/c1f39d0965d127f4821fe7001ea6fb1c44b087c6a05c0cbf272204951930fc34.jpg)  
Figure 6-18.   Leading edge high lift devices.  

increase the wing camber, but allows a higher maximum   $\mathrm{C_{L}}$  because the stall is delayed until the wing reaches a greater AOA.  

Movable slats consist of leading edge segments that move on  tracks. At low angles of attack, each slat is held flush against  the wing’s leading edge by the high pressure that forms at  the wing’s leading edge. As the AOA increases, the high- pressure area moves aft below the lower surface of the wing,  allowing the slats to move forward. Some slats, however, are  pilot operated and can be deployed at any AOA. Opening a  slat allows the air below the wing to flow over the wing’s  upper surface, delaying airflow separation.  

Leading edge flaps, like trailing edge flaps, are used to  increase both  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}}$   and the camber of the wings. This type  of leading edge device is frequently used in conjunction with  trailing edge flaps and can reduce the nose-down pitching  movement produced by the latter. As is true with trailing edge  flaps, a small increment of leading edge flaps increases lift  to a much greater extent than drag. As flaps are extended,  drag increases at a greater rate than lift.  

Leading edge cuffs, like leading edge flaps and trailing edge  flaps are used to increase both   $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{L-MAX}}$   and the camber of  the wings. Unlike leading edge flaps and trailing edge flaps,  leading edge cuffs are fixed aerodynamic devices. In most  cases, leading edge cuffs extend the leading edge down and  forward. This causes the airflow to attach better to the upper  surface of the wing at higher angles of attack, thus lowering  an aircraft’s stall speed. The fixed nature of leading edge cuffs  extracts a penalty in maximum cruise airspeed, but recent  advances in design and technology have reduced this penalty.  

# Spoilers  

Found on some fixed-wing aircraft, high drag devices called  spoilers are deployed from the wings to spoil the smooth  airflow, reducing lift and increasing drag. On gliders, spoilers  are most often used to control rate of descent for accurate  landings. On other aircraft, spoilers are often used for roll  control, an advantage of which is the elimination of adverse  yaw. To turn right, for example, the spoiler on the right wing  is raised, destroying some of the lift and creating more drag  on the right. The right wing drops, and the aircraft banks  and yaws to the right. Deploying spoilers on both wings at  the same time allows the aircraft to descend without gaining  speed. Spoilers are also deployed to help reduce ground roll  after landing. By destroying lift, they transfer weight to the  wheels, improving braking effectiveness.  [Figure 6-19]  

# Trim Systems  

Although an aircraft can be operated throughout a wide range  of attitudes, airspeeds, and power settings, it can be designed to  fly hands-off within only a very limited combination of these  

![](images/d7bb377a495648166553290682b4cdc5e1fd6750f1da64dcb544e3b7286a76af.jpg)  
Figure 6-19.   Spoilers reduce lift and increase drag during descent  and landing.  

variables. Trim systems are used to relieve the pilot of the  need to maintain constant pressure on the flight controls, and  usually consist of flight deck controls and small hinged devices  attached to the trailing edge of one or more of the primary flight  control surfaces. Designed to help minimize a pilot’s workload,  trim systems aerodynamically assist movement and position of  the flight control surface to which they are attached. Common  types of trim systems include trim tabs, balance tabs, antiservo  tabs, ground adjustable tabs, and an adjustable stabilizer.  

# Trim Tabs  

The most common installation on small aircraft is a single  trim tab attached to the trailing edge of the elevator. Most trim  tabs are manually operated by a small, vertically mounted  control wheel. However, a trim crank may be found in some  aircraft. The flight deck control includes a trim tab position  indicator. Placing the trim control in the full nose-down  position moves the trim tab to its full up position. With  the trim tab up and into the airstream, the airflow over the  horizontal tail surface tends to force the trailing edge of the  elevator down. This causes the tail of the aircraft to move  up and the nose to move down.  [Figure 6-20]  

If the trim tab is set to the full nose-up position, the tab moves  to its full down position. In this case, the air flowing under the  horizontal tail surface hits the tab and forces the trailing edge  of the elevator up, reducing the elevator’s AOA. This causes  the tail of the aircraft to move down and the nose to move up.  

In spite of the opposing directional movement of the trim  tab and the elevator, control of trim is natural to a pilot. If  the pilot needs to exert constant back pressure on a control  column, the need for nose-up trim is indicated. The normal  trim procedure is to continue trimming until the aircraft is  balanced and the nose-heavy condition is no longer apparent.  Pilots normally establish the desired power, pitch attitude,  and configuration first, and then trim the aircraft to relieve  

![](images/9f801f959d7fb57b87cbc3c91aa08fe22a14e6e0528195c529a2ea4baf20e8d8.jpg)  
Figure 6-20.   The movement of the elevator is opposite to the  direction of movement of the elevator trim tab. The movement of the elevator is opposite to the  

control pressures that may exist for that flight condition. As  power, pitch attitude, or configuration changes, retrimming  is necessary to relieve the control pressures for the new  flight condition.  

# Balance Tabs  

The control forces may be excessively high in some aircraft,  and, in order to decrease them, the manufacturer may use  balance tabs. They look like trim tabs and are hinged in  approximately the same places as trim tabs. The essential  difference between the two is that the balancing tab is coupled  to the control surface rod so that when the primary control  surface is moved in any direction, the tab automatically  moves in the opposite direction. The airflow striking the tab  counterbalances some of the air pressure against the primary  control surface and enables the pilot to move the control more  easily and hold the control surface in position.  

If the linkage between the balance tab and the fixed  surface is adjustable from the flight deck, the tab acts as a  combination trim and balance tab that can be adjusted to a  desired deflection.  

# Servo Tabs  

Servo tabs are very similar in operation and appearance to the  trim tabs previously discussed. A servo tab is a small portion  of a flight control surface that deploys in such a way that it  helps to move the entire flight control surface in the direction  that the pilot wishes it to go. A servo tab is a dynamic device  that deploys to decrease the pilots work load and de-stabilize  the aircraft. Servo tabs are sometimes referred to as flight tabs  and are used primarily on large aircraft. They aid the pilot in  moving the control surface and in holding it in the desired  position. Only the servo tab moves in response to movement  of the pilot’s flight control, and the force of the airflow on  the servo tab then moves the primary control surface.  

# Antiservo Tabs  

Antiservo tabs work in the same manner as balance tabs  except, instead of moving in the opposite direction, they move  in the same direction as the trailing edge of the stabilator.  In addition to decreasing the sensitivity of the stabilator, an  antiservo tab also functions as a trim device to relieve control  pressure and maintain the stabilator in the desired position.  The fixed end of the linkage is on the opposite side of the  surface from the horn on the tab; when the trailing edge of the  stabilator moves up, the linkage forces the trailing edge of the  tab up. When the stabilator moves down, the tab also moves  down. Conversely, trim tabs on elevators move opposite of  the control surface.  [Figure 6-21]  

# Ground Adjustable Tabs  

Many small aircraft have a nonmovable metal trim tab on the  rudder. This tab is bent in one direction or the other while on  the ground to apply a trim force to the rudder. The correct  displacement is determined by trial and error. Usually, small  

![](images/e2f83afdc4a6b4a1e492c53cd37e91cd5f4414c317e81fd4293867dbe9d509a3.jpg)  
Figure 6-21.   An antiservo tab attempts to streamline the control  surface and is used to make the stabilator less sensitive by opposing  the force exerted by the pilot.  

adjustments are necessary until the aircraft no longer skids  left or right during normal cruising flight.  [Figure 6-22]  

# Adjustable Stabilizer  

Rather than using a movable tab on the trailing edge of the  elevator, some aircraft have an adjustable stabilizer. With this  arrangement, linkages pivot the horizontal stabilizer about  its rear spar. This is accomplished by the use of a jackscrew  mounted on the leading edge of the stabilator.  [Figure 6-23] On small aircraft, the jackscrew is cable operated with a trim  wheel or crank. On larger aircraft, it is motor driven. The  trimming effect and flight deck indications for an adjustable  stabilizer are similar to those of a trim tab.  

# Autopilot  

Autopilot is an automatic flight control system that keeps an  aircraft in level flight or on a set course. It can be directed by  the pilot, or it may be coupled to a radio navigation signal.  Autopilot reduces the physical and mental demands on a pilot  and increases safety. The common features available on an  autopilot are altitude and heading hold.  

The simplest systems use gyroscopic attitude indicators and  magnetic compasses to control servos connected to the flight  control system.  [Figure 6-24]  The number and location of  these servos depends on the complexity of the system. For  example, a single-axis autopilot controls the aircraft about the  longitudinal axis and a servo actuates the ailerons. A three-axis  autopilot controls the aircraft about the longitudinal, lateral, and  vertical axes. Three different servos actuate ailerons, elevator,  and rudder. More advanced systems often include a vertical  speed and/or indicated airspeed hold mode. Advanced autopilot  systems are coupled to navigational aids through a flight director.  

![](images/27852876ef0b9f80564187cb828a27408408c0f89cc9dd9def994fcc8643bf11.jpg)  
Figure 6-22.   A ground adjustable tab is used on the rudder of many  small airplanes to correct for a tendency to fly with the fuselage  slightly misaligned with the relative wind.

Figure 6-23.   Some aircraft, including most jet transports, use an  adjustable stabilizer to provide the required pitch trim forces.  

The autopilot system also incorporates a disconnect safety  feature to disengage the system automatically or manually.  These autopilots work with inertial navigation systems,  global positioning systems (GPS), and flight computers to  control the aircraft. In fly-by-wire systems, the autopilot is  an integrated component.  

Additionally, autopilots can be manually overridden. Because  autopilot systems differ widely in their operation, refer to  the autopilot operating instructions in the Airplane Flight  Manual (AFM) or the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH).  

# Chapter Summary  

Because flight control systems and aerodynamic  characteristics vary greatly between aircraft, it is essential  that a pilot become familiar with the primary and secondary  flight control systems of the aircraft being flown. The  primary source of this information is the AFM or the POH.  Various manufacturer and owner group websites can also be  a valuable source of additional information.

# Chapter 7 Aircraft Systems  

# Introduction  

This chapter covers the primary systems found on most  aircraft. These include the engine, propeller, induction,  ignition, as well as the fuel, lubrication, cooling, electrical,  landing gear, and environmental control systems.  

# Powerplant  

An aircraft engine, or powerplant, produces thrust to propel  an aircraft. Reciprocating engines and turboprop engines  work in combination with a propeller to produce thrust.  Turbojet and turbofan engines produce thrust by increasing  the velocity of air flowing through the engine. All of these  powerplants also drive the various systems that support the  operation of an aircraft.  

# Reciprocating Engines  

Most small aircraft are designed with reciprocating  engines. The name is derived from the back-and-forth, or  reciprocating, movement of the pistons that produces the  mechanical energy necessary to accomplish work.  

Driven by a revitalization of the general aviation (GA)  industry and advances in both material and engine design,  reciprocating engine technology has improved dramatically  over the past two decades. The integration of computerized  engine management systems has improved fuel efficiency,  decreased emissions, and reduced pilot workload.  

Reciprocating engines operate on the basic principle of  converting chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy.  This conversion occurs within the cylinders of the engine  through the process of combustion. The two primary  reciprocating engine designs are the spark ignition and the  compression ignition. The spark ignition reciprocating engine  has served as the powerplant of choice for many years. In  an effort to reduce operating costs, simplify design, and  improve reliability, several engine manufacturers are turning  to compression ignition as a viable alternative. Often referred  to as jet fuel piston engines, compression ignition engines  have the added advantage of utilizing readily available and  lower cost diesel or jet fuel.  

The main mechanical components of the spark ignition and  the compression ignition engine are essentially the same.  Both use cylindrical combustion chambers and pistons that  travel the length of the cylinders to convert linear motion  into the rotary motion of the crankshaft. The main difference  between spark ignition and compression ignition is the  process of igniting the fuel. Spark ignition engines use a  spark plug to ignite a pre-mixed fuel-air mixture. (Fuel-air  mixture is the ratio of the “weight” of fuel to the “weight”  of air in the mixture to be burned.) A compression ignition  engine first compresses the air in the cylinder, raising its  temperature to a degree necessary for automatic ignition  when fuel is injected into the cylinder.  

These two engine designs can be further classified as:  

1. 	 Cylinder arrangement with respect to the crankshaft— radial, in-line, v-type, or opposed 2. 	 Operating cycle—two or four 3. 	 Method of cooling—liquid or air  

Radial engines were widely used during World War II and  many are still in service today. With these engines, a row or  rows of cylinders are arranged in a circular pattern around  the crankcase. The main advantage of a radial engine is the  favorable power-to-weight ratio.  [Figure 7-1]  

![](images/c21be2f1dcdbda58af4716bec7172aadcb674a00a501da758be287d365da8256.jpg)  
Figure 7-1.   Radial engine.  

In-line engines have a comparatively small frontal area, but  their power-to-weight ratios are relatively low. In addition,  the rearmost cylinders of an air-cooled, in-line engine  receive very little cooling air, so these engines are normally  limited to four or six cylinders. V-type engines provide  more horsepower than in-line engines and still retain a small  frontal area.  

Continued improvements in engine design led to the  development of the horizontally-opposed engine, which  remains the most popular reciprocating engines used on  smaller aircraft. These engines always have an even number  of cylinders, since a cylinder on one side of the crankcase  “opposes” a cylinder on the other side.  [Figure 7-2]  The  majority of these engines are air cooled and usually are  mounted in a horizontal position when installed on fixed-wing  airplanes. Opposed-type engines have high power-to-weight  ratios because they have a comparatively small, lightweight  crankcase. In addition, the compact cylinder arrangement  reduces the engine’s frontal area and allows a streamlined  installation that minimizes aerodynamic drag.  

![](images/d286470eef465145b65ffe254c1ac046d21477a4a28e28270582572544cb50ba.jpg)  
Figure 7-2.   Horizontally opposed engine.  

Depending on the engine manufacturer, all of these  arrangements can be designed to utilize spark or compression  ignition and operate on either a two- or four-stroke cycle.  

In a two-stroke engine, the conversion of chemical energy  into mechanical energy occurs over a two-stroke operating  cycle. The intake, compression, power, and exhaust processes  occur in only two strokes of the piston rather than the more  common four strokes. Because a two-stroke engine has  a power stroke upon each revolution of the crankshaft, it  typically has higher power-to-weight ratio than a comparable  four-stroke engine. Due to the inherent inefficiency and  disproportionate emissions of the earliest designs, use of the  two-stroke engine has been limited in aviation.  

Recent advances in material and engine design have  reduced many of the negative characteristics associated  with two-stroke engines. Modern two-stroke engines often  use conventional oil sumps, oil pumps, and full pressure  fed lubrication systems. The use of direct fuel injection  and pressurized air, characteristic of advanced compression  ignition engines, make two-stroke compression ignition  engines a viable alternative to the more common four-stroke  spark ignition designs.  [Figure 7-3]  

Spark ignition four-stroke engines remain the most common  design used in GA today.  [Figure 7-4]  The main parts of a  spark ignition reciprocating engine include the cylinders,  crankcase, and accessory housing. The intake/exhaust valves,  spark plugs, and pistons are located in the cylinders. The  crankshaft and connecting rods are located in the crankcase.  The magnetos are normally located on the engine accessory  housing.

Figure 7-4.   Main components of a spark ignition reciprocating  engine.  

In a four-stroke engine, the conversion of chemical energy into  mechanical energy occurs over a four-stroke operating cycle.  The intake, compression, power, and exhaust processes occur  in four separate strokes of the piston in the following order.  

1. 	 The intake stroke begins as the piston starts its  downward travel. When this happens, the intake  valve opens and the fuel-air mixture is drawn into the  cylinder. 2. 	 The compression stroke begins when the intake valve  closes, and the piston starts moving back to the top of  the cylinder. This phase of the cycle is used to obtain  a much greater power output from the fuel-air mixture  once it is ignited. 3. 	 The power stroke begins when the fuel-air mixture is  ignited. This causes a tremendous pressure increase  in the cylinder and forces the piston downward away  from the cylinder head, creating the power that turns  the crankshaft.  

4. 	 The exhaust stroke is used to purge the cylinder of  burned gases. It begins when the exhaust valve opens,  and the piston starts to move toward the cylinder head  once again.  

Even when the engine is operated at a fairly low speed,  the four-stroke cycle takes place several hundred times  each minute.  [Figure 7-5]  In a four-cylinder engine, each  cylinder operates on a different stroke. Continuous rotation  of a crankshaft is maintained by the precise timing of the  power strokes in each cylinder. Continuous operation of the  engine depends on the simultaneous function of auxiliary  systems, including the induction, ignition, fuel, oil, cooling,  and exhaust systems.  

The latest advance in aircraft reciprocating engines was  pioneered in the mid-1960s by Frank Thielert, who looked  to the automotive industry for answers on how to integrate  diesel technology into an aircraft engine. The advantage  

![](images/ee04097ab0e4bdc13b9317a14dcabb91871c130b91a891dbd33b7fa91e12f97f.jpg)  
Figure 7-5.   The arrows in this illustration indicate the direction of  motion of the crankshaft and piston during the four-stroke cycle.  

of a diesel-fueled reciprocating engine lies in the physical  similarity of diesel and kerosene. Aircraft equipped with a  diesel piston engine runs on standard aviation fuel kerosene,  which provides more independence, higher reliability, lower  consumption, and operational cost saving.  

In 1999, Thielert formed Thielert Aircraft Engines (TAE)  to design, develop, certify, and manufacture a brand-new  Jet-A-burning diesel cycle engine (also known as jet-fueled  piston engine) for the GA industry. By March 2001, the first  prototype engine became the first certified diesel engine  since World War II. TAE continues to design and develop  diesel cycle engines and other engine manufacturers, such as  Société de Motorisations Aéronautiques (SMA), now offer  jet-fueled piston engines as well. TAE engines can be found  on the Diamond DA40 single and the DA42 Twin Star; the  first diesel engine to be part of the type certificate of a new  original equipment manufacturer (OEM) aircraft.  

These engines have also gained a toehold in the retrofit  market with a supplemental type certificate (STC) to re- engine the Cessna 172 models and the Piper PA-28 family.  The jet-fueled piston engine’s technology has continued to  progress and a full authority digital engine control (FADEC,  discussed more fully later in the chapter) is standard on such  equipped aircraft, which minimizes complication of engine  control. By 2007, various jet-fueled piston aircraft had logged  well over 600,000 hours of service.  

# Propeller  

The propeller is a rotating airfoil, subject to induced drag,  stalls, and other aerodynamic principles that apply to any  airfoil. It provides the necessary thrust to pull, or in some  cases push, the aircraft through the air. The engine power is  used to rotate the propeller, which in turn generates thrust  very similar to the manner in which a wing produces lift.  The amount of thrust produced depends on the shape of the  airfoil, the angle of attack (AOA) of the propeller blade, and  the revolutions per minute (rpm) of the engine. The propeller  itself is twisted so the blade angle changes from hub to tip.  The greatest angle of incidence, or the highest pitch, is at the  hub while the smallest angle of incidence or smallest pitch  is at the tip.  [Figure 7-6]  

The reason for the twist is to produce uniform lift from the  hub to the tip. As the blade rotates, there is a difference in  the actual speed of the various portions of the blade. The tip  of the blade travels faster than the part near the hub, because  the tip travels a greater distance than the hub in the same  length of time.  [Figure 7-7]  Changing the angle of incidence  (pitch) from the hub to the tip to correspond with the speed  produces uniform lift throughout the length of the blade. A  propeller blade designed with the same angle of incidence  

![](images/118db50a964f2012655ebe9bc560ee26cc46e191fb1bcf426c0ee268f00d875b.jpg)  
Figure 7-6.   Changes in propeller blade angle from hub to tip.  

throughout its entire length would be inefficient because as  airspeed increases in flight, the portion near the hub would  have a negative AOA while the blade tip would be stalled.  Small aircraft are equipped with either one of two types of  propellers: fixed-pitch or adjustable-pitch.  

# Fixed-Pitch Propeller  

A propeller with fixed blade angles is a fixed-pitch propeller.  The pitch of this propeller is set by the manufacturer and  cannot be changed. Since a fixed-pitch propeller achieves  the best efficiency only at a given combination of airspeed  and rpm, the pitch setting is ideal for neither cruise nor  climb. Thus, the aircraft suffers a bit in each performance  category. The fixed-pitch propeller is used when low weight,  simplicity, and low cost are needed.  

There are two types of fixed-pitch propellers: climb and  cruise. Whether the airplane has a climb or cruise propeller  

![](images/b4dc60e41cf13c8b105ac148bd4902146ab0fae32f0c48b47fad9132a913f02f.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.   Relationship of travel distance and speed of various  portions of propeller blade.  

installed depends upon its intended use. The climb propeller  has a lower pitch, therefore less drag. Less drag results in  higher rpm and more horsepower capability, which increases  performance during takeoffs and climbs but decreases  performance during cruising flight.  

The cruise propeller has a higher pitch, therefore more  drag. More drag results in lower rpm and less horsepower  capability, which decreases performance during takeoffs and  climbs but increases efficiency during cruising flight.  

The propeller is usually mounted on a shaft, which may be  an extension of the engine crankshaft. In this case, the rpm  of the propeller would be the same as the crankshaft rpm. On  some engines, the propeller is mounted on a shaft geared to  the engine crankshaft. In this type, the rpm of the propeller  is different than that of the engine.  

In a fixed-pitch propeller, the tachometer is the indicator of  engine power.  [Figure 7-8]  A tachometer is calibrated in  hundreds of rpm and gives a direct indication of the engine  and propeller rpm. The instrument is color coded with a green  arc denoting the maximum continuous operating rpm. Some  tachometers have additional markings to reflect engine and/or  propeller limitations. The manufacturer’s recommendations  should be used as a reference to clarify any misunderstanding  of tachometer markings.  

The rpm is regulated by the throttle, which controls the fuel- air flow to the engine. At a given altitude, the higher the  tachometer reading, the higher the power output of the engine.  

When operating altitude increases, the tachometer may not  show correct power output of the engine. For example, 2,300  rpm at 5,000 feet produces less horsepower than  ${}^{2,300\,\mathrm{rpm}}$    at sea level because power output depends on air density. Air  density decreases as altitude increases and a decrease in air  

![](images/0897e8abda7dda7d7964eac2e416f3000e9f1cd59fd690f8f121303331cb43a0.jpg)  
Figure 7-8.  Engine rpm is indicated on the tachometer.  

density (higher density altitude) decreases the power output  of the engine. As altitude changes, the position of the throttle  must be changed to maintain the same rpm. As altitude is  increased, the throttle must be opened further to indicate the  same rpm as at a lower altitude.  

# Adjustable-Pitch Propeller  

The adjustable-pitch propeller was the forerunner of the  constant-speed propeller. It is a propeller with blades whose  pitch can be adjusted on the ground with the engine not  running, but which cannot be adjusted in flight. It is also  referred to as a ground adjustable propeller. By the 1930s,  pioneer aviation inventors were laying the ground work for  automatic pitch-change mechanisms, which is why the term  sometimes refers to modern constant-speed propellers that  are adjustable in flight.  

The first adjustable-pitch propeller systems provided only two  pitch settings: low and high. Today, most adjustable-pitch  propeller systems are capable of a range of pitch settings.  

A constant-speed propeller is a controllable-pitch propeller  whose pitch is automatically varied in flight by a governor  maintaining constant rpm despite varying air loads. It is the  most common type of adjustable-pitch propeller. The main  advantage of a constant-speed propeller is that it converts  a high percentage of brake horsepower (BHP) into thrust  horsepower (THP) over a wide range of rpm and airspeed  combinations. A constant-speed propeller is more efficient  than other propellers because it allows selection of the most  efficient engine rpm for the given conditions.  

An aircraft with a constant-speed propeller has two controls:  the throttle and the propeller control. The throttle controls  power output, and the propeller control regulates engine  rpm. This regulates propeller rpm, which is registered on  the tachometer.  

Once a specific rpm is selected, a governor automatically  adjusts the propeller blade angle as necessary to maintain  the selected rpm. For example, after setting the desired rpm  during cruising flight, an increase in airspeed or decrease in  propeller load causes the propeller blade angle to increase  as necessary to maintain the selected rpm. A reduction in  airspeed or increase in propeller load causes the propeller  blade angle to decrease.  

The propeller’s constant-speed range, defined by the high  and low pitch stops, is the range of possible blade angles for  a constant-speed propeller. As long as the propeller blade  angle is within the constant-speed range and not against  either pitch stop, a constant engine rpm is maintained. If  the propeller blades contact a pitch stop, the engine rpm  will increase or decrease as appropriate, with changes in  airspeed and propeller load. For example, once a specific  rpm has been selected, if aircraft speed decreases enough to  rotate the propeller blades until they contact the low pitch  stop, any further decrease in airspeed will cause engine rpm  to decrease the same way as if a fixed-pitch propeller were  installed. The same holds true when an aircraft equipped with  a constant-speed propeller accelerates to a faster airspeed. As  the aircraft accelerates, the propeller blade angle increases to  maintain the selected rpm until the high pitch stop is reached.  Once this occurs, the blade angle cannot increase any further  and engine rpm increases.  

On aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller, power  output is controlled by the throttle and indicated by a manifold  pressure gauge. The gauge measures the absolute pressure of  the fuel-air mixture inside the intake manifold and is more  correctly a measure of manifold absolute pressure (MAP). At  a constant rpm and altitude, the amount of power produced  is directly related to the fuel-air mixture being delivered to  the combustion chamber. As the throttle setting is increased,  more fuel and air flows to the engine and MAP increases.  When the engine is not running, the manifold pressure gauge  indicates ambient air pressure (i.e., 29.92 inches mercury   $(29.92\ ^{"}\mathrm{Hg})$  ). When the engine is started, the manifold  pressure indication decreases to a value less than ambient  pressure (i.e., idle at   $12\ "\mathrm{Hg},$  ). Engine failure or power loss  is indicated on the manifold gauge as an increase in manifold  pressure to a value corresponding to the ambient air pressure  at the altitude where the failure occurred.  [Figure 7-9]  

The manifold pressure gauge is color coded to indicate the  engine’s operating range. The face of the manifold pressure  gauge contains a green arc to show the normal operating  range and a red radial line to indicate the upper limit of  manifold pressure.  

![](images/0aab7826292a06639fed6cde4999b381d480c22bf10dc36dbb0c12d97b22bae2.jpg)  
Figure 7-9.   Engine power output is indicated on the manifold  pressure gauge.  

For any given rpm, there is a manifold pressure that should  not be exceeded. If manifold pressure is excessive for a given  rpm, the pressure within the cylinders could be exceeded,  placing undue stress on the cylinders. If repeated too  frequently, this stress can weaken the cylinder components  and eventually cause engine failure.  

A pilot can avoid conditions that overstress the cylinders  by being constantly aware of the rpm, especially when  increasing the manifold pressure. Consult the manufacturer’s  recommendations for power settings of a particular engine to  maintain the proper relationship between manifold pressure  and rpm.  

When both manifold pressure and rpm need to be changed,  avoid engine overstress by making power adjustments in  the proper order:  

•	 When power settings are being decreased, reduce  manifold pressure before reducing rpm. If rpm is  reduced before manifold pressure, manifold pressure  automatically increases, possibly exceeding the  manufacturer’s tolerances. •	 When power settings are being increased, reverse the  order—increase rpm first, then manifold pressure. •	 To prevent damage to radial engines, minimize  operating time at maximum rpm and manifold  pressure, and avoid operation at maximum rpm and  low manifold pressure.  

The engine and/or airframe manufacturer’s recommendations  should be followed to prevent severe wear, fatigue, and  damage to high-performance reciprocating engines.  

# Propeller Overspeed in Piston Engine Aircraft  

On March 17, 2010, the Federal Aviation Administration 

 (FAA) issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin 

 (SAIB) CE-10-21. The subject was Propellers/Propulsers;  Propeller Overspeed in Piston Engine Aircraft to alert  operators, pilots, and aircraft manufacturers of concerns  for an optimum response to a propeller overspeed in piston  engine aircraft with variable pitch propellers. Although a  SAIB is not regulatory in nature, the FAA recommends that  the information be read and taken into consideration for the  safety of flight.  

The document explains that a single-engine aircraft  experienced a propeller overspeed during cruise flight at  7,000 feet. The pilot reported that the application of throttle  resulted in a propeller overspeed with no appreciable thrust.  The pilot attempted to glide to a nearby airport and established  the “best glide” speed of 110 knots, as published in the Pilot’s  Operating Handbook (POH), but was unable to reach the  airport and was forced to conduct an off-field landing.  

It was further explained that a determination was made that the  propeller experienced a failure causing the blade pitch change  mechanism to move to the low pitch stop position. This caused  the propeller to operate as a fixed-pitch propeller such that it  changes rpm with changes in power and airspeed. The low  pitch setting allows for maximum power during takeoff but  can result in a propeller overspeed at a higher airspeed.  

A performance evaluation of the flight condition was  performed for the particular aircraft model involved in this  incident. This evaluation indicated that an airspeed lower  than the best glide speed would have resulted in increased  thrust enabling the pilot to maintain level flight. There are  numerous variables in aircraft, engines, and propellers  that affect aircraft performance. For some aircraft models,  the published best glide speed may not be low enough to  generate adequate thrust for a given propeller installation in  this situation (propeller blades at low pitch stop position).  

The operators of aircraft with variable pitch propellers should  be aware that in certain instances of propeller overspeed, the  airspeed necessary to maintain level flight may be different  than the speed associated with engine-out best glide speed.  The appropriate emergency procedures should be followed to  mitigate the emergency situation in the event of a propeller  overspeed; however, pilots should be aware that some  reduction in airspeed may result in the ability for continued  safe flight and landing. The determination of an airspeed that  is more suitable than engine-out best glide speed should only  be conducted at a safe altitude when the pilot has time to  determine an alternative course of action other than landing  immediately.  

# Induction Systems  

The induction system brings in air from the outside, mixes  it with fuel, and delivers the fuel-air mixture to the cylinder  where combustion occurs. Outside air enters the induction  system through an intake port on the front of the engine  cowling. This port normally contains an air filter that inhibits  the entry of dust and other foreign objects. Since the filter  may occasionally become clogged, an alternate source of  air must be available. Usually, the alternate air comes from  inside the engine cowling, where it bypasses a clogged air  filter. Some alternate air sources function automatically,  while others operate manually.  

Two types of induction systems are commonly used in small  aircraft engines:  

1.	 The carburetor system mixes the fuel and air in  the carburetor before this mixture enters the intake  manifold. 2.	 The fuel injection system mixes the fuel and air  immediately before entry into each cylinder or injects  fuel directly into each cylinder.  

# Carburetor Systems  

Aircraft carburetors are separated into two categories: float- type carburetors and pressure-type carburetors. Float-type  carburetors, complete with idling, accelerating, mixture  control, idle cutoff, and power enrichment systems, are the  most common of the two carburetor types. Pressure-type  carburetors are usually not found on small aircraft. The basic  difference between a float-type and a pressure-type carburetor  is the delivery of fuel. The pressure-type carburetor delivers  fuel under pressure by a fuel pump.  

In the operation of the float-type carburetor system, the  outside air first flows through an air filter, usually located  at an air intake in the front part of the engine cowling. This  filtered air flows into the carburetor and through a venturi, a  narrow throat in the carburetor. When the air flows through  the venturi, a low-pressure area is created that forces the  fuel to flow through a main fuel jet located at the throat. The  fuel then flows into the airstream where it is mixed with the  flowing air.  [Figure 7-10]  

The fuel-air mixture is then drawn through the intake  manifold and into the combustion chambers where it is  ignited. The float-type carburetor acquires its name from a  float that rests on fuel within the float chamber. A needle  attached to the float opens and closes an opening at the  bottom of the carburetor bowl. This meters the amount of  fuel entering into the carburetor, depending upon the position  of the float, which is controlled by the level of fuel in the  float chamber. When the level of the fuel forces the float  to rise, the needle valve closes the fuel opening and shuts  off the fuel flow to the carburetor. The needle valve opens  again when the engine requires additional fuel. The flow of  the fuel-air mixture to the combustion chambers is regulated  by the throttle valve, which is controlled by the throttle in  the flight deck.  

The float-type carburetor has several distinct disadvantages.  First, they do not function well during abrupt maneuvers.  Secondly, the discharge of fuel at low pressure leads to  incomplete vaporization and difficulty in discharging  fuel into some types of supercharged systems. The chief  disadvantage of the float-type carburetor, however, is its  icing tendency. Since the float-type carburetor must discharge  

![](images/17640cb9c0067aa70cccd51c1e82e94670ba589d547583b4aec09e93721b4d56.jpg)  
Figure 7-10.   Float-type carburetor.  

fuel at a point of low pressure, the discharge nozzle must be  located at the venturi throat, and the throttle valve must be  on the engine side of the discharge nozzle. This means that  the drop in temperature due to fuel vaporization takes place  within the venturi. As a result, ice readily forms in the venturi  and on the throttle valve.  

A pressure-type carburetor discharges fuel into the airstream  at a pressure well above atmospheric pressure. This results  in better vaporization and permits the discharge of fuel into  the airstream on the engine side of the throttle valve. With the  discharge nozzle in this position fuel vaporization takes place  after the air has passed through the throttle valve and at a point  where the drop in temperature is offset by heat from the engine.  Thus, the danger of fuel vaporization icing is practically  eliminated. The effects of rapid maneuvers and rough air on  the pressure-type carburetors are negligible, since their fuel  chambers remain filled under all operating conditions.  

# Mixture Control  

Carburetors are normally calibrated at sea-level air pressure  where the correct fuel-air mixture ratio is established with the  mixture control set in the FULL RICH position. However, as  altitude increases, the density of air entering the carburetor  decreases, while the density of the fuel remains the same. This  creates a progressively richer mixture that can result in engine  roughness and an appreciable loss of power. The roughness  normally is due to spark plug fouling from excessive carbon  buildup on the plugs. Carbon buildup occurs because the  rich mixture lowers the temperature inside the cylinder,  inhibiting complete combustion of the fuel. This condition  may occur during the runup prior to takeoff at high-elevation  airports and during climbs or cruise flight at high altitudes.  To maintain the correct fuel-air mixture, the mixture must  be leaned using the mixture control. Leaning the mixture  decreases fuel flow, which compensates for the decreased  air density at high altitude.  

During a descent from high altitude, the fuel-air mixture  must be enriched, or it may become too lean. An overly lean  mixture causes detonation, which may result in rough engine  operation, overheating, and/or a loss of power. The best way  to maintain the proper fuel-air mixture is to monitor the  engine temperature and enrich the mixture as needed. Proper  mixture control and better fuel economy for fuel-injected  engines can be achieved by using an exhaust gas temperature  (EGT) gauge. Since the process of adjusting the mixture can  vary from one aircraft to another, it is important to refer to  the airplane flight manual (AFM) or the POH to determine  the specific procedures for a given aircraft.  

# Carburetor Icing  

As mentioned earlier, one disadvantage of the float-type  carburetor is its icing tendency. Carburetor ice occurs due  to the effect of fuel vaporization and the decrease in air  pressure in the venturi, which causes a sharp temperature  drop in the carburetor. If water vapor in the air condenses  when the carburetor temperature is at or below freezing, ice  may form on internal surfaces of the carburetor, including  the throttle valve.  [Figure 7-11]  

The reduced air pressure, as well as the vaporization of fuel,  contributes to the temperature decrease in the carburetor. Ice  generally forms in the vicinity of the throttle valve and in the  venturi throat. This restricts the flow of the fuel-air mixture  and reduces power. If enough ice builds up, the engine may  cease to operate. Carburetor ice is most likely to occur when  temperatures are below 70 degrees Fahrenheit   $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   or 21  degrees Celsius   $(^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$   and the relative humidity is above 80  percent. Due to the sudden cooling that takes place in the  carburetor, icing can occur even in outside air temperatures  as high as   $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\,(38\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   and humidity as low as 50 percent.  This temperature drop can be as much as 60 to 70 absolute  (versus relative) Fahrenheit degrees   $(70\mathrm{~x~}100/180=38.89$  

![](images/3b837e41b2f649e6e5dfd19b1db439e487711b69af1b9b7d2a979ce35827776b.jpg)  
Figure 7-11.   The formation of carburetor ice may reduce or block  fuel-air flow to the engine.  

Celsius degrees) (Remember there are 180 Fahrenheit degrees  from freezing to boiling versus 100 degrees for the Celsius  scale.) Therefore, an outside air temperature of  $100\,\mathrm{F}\left(38\,\mathrm{C}\right)$  ,  a temperature drop of an absolute  $70\,\mathrm{F}$   degrees (38.89 Celsius  degrees) results in an air temperature in the carburetor of 30  F (-1 C).  [Figure 7-12]  

The first indication of carburetor icing in an aircraft with  a fixed-pitch propeller is a decrease in engine rpm, which  may be followed by engine roughness. In an aircraft with a  constant-speed propeller, carburetor icing is usually indicated  by a decrease in manifold pressure, but no reduction in rpm.  Propeller pitch is automatically adjusted to compensate for  loss of power. Thus, a constant rpm is maintained. Although  carburetor ice can occur during any phase of flight, it is  particularly dangerous when using reduced power during a  descent. Under certain conditions, carburetor ice could build  unnoticed until power is added. To combat the effects of  carburetor ice, engines with float-type carburetors employ a  carburetor heat system.  

# Carburetor Heat  

Carburetor heat is an anti-icing system that preheats the air  before it reaches the carburetor and is intended to keep the  fuel-air mixture above freezing to prevent the formation of  carburetor ice. Carburetor heat can be used to melt ice that has  already formed in the carburetor if the accumulation is not too  great, but using carburetor heat as a preventative measure is  the better option. Additionally, carburetor heat may be used  as an alternate air source if the intake filter clogs, such as in  sudden or unexpected airframe icing conditions. The carburetor  heat should be checked during the engine runup. When using  carburetor heat, follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.  

When conditions are conducive to carburetor icing during  flight, periodic checks should be made to detect its  

![](images/37b934e0b8214db0659d876a5bd8efc3ea528a8405dc76c66c3ee8e6218587d2.jpg)  
Figure 7-12.   Although carburetor ice is most likely to form when  the temperature and humidity are in ranges indicated by this chart,  carburetor icing is possible under conditions not depicted.  

presence. If detected, full carburetor heat should be applied  immediately, and it should be left in the ON position until  the pilot is certain that all the ice has been removed. If ice  is present, applying partial heat or leaving heat on for an  insufficient time might aggravate the situation. In extreme  cases of carburetor icing, even after the ice has been removed,  full carburetor heat should be used to prevent further ice  formation. If installed, a carburetor temperature gauge is  useful in determining when to use carburetor heat.  

Whenever the throttle is closed during flight, the engine cools  rapidly and vaporization of the fuel is less complete than if  the engine is warm. Also, in this condition, the engine is more  susceptible to carburetor icing. If carburetor icing conditions  are suspected and closed-throttle operation anticipated, adjust  the carburetor heat to the full ON position before closing the  throttle and leave it on during the closed-throttle operation.  The heat aids in vaporizing the fuel and helps prevent the  formation of carburetor ice. Periodically, open the throttle  smoothly for a few seconds to keep the engine warm;  otherwise, the carburetor heater may not provide enough  heat to prevent icing.  

The use of carburetor heat causes a decrease in engine  power, sometimes up to 15 percent, because the heated  air is less dense than the outside air that had been entering  the engine. This enriches the mixture. When ice is present  in an aircraft with a fixed-pitch propeller and carburetor  heat is being used, there is a decrease in rpm, followed by  a gradual increase in rpm as the ice melts. The engine also  should run more smoothly after the ice has been removed.  If ice is not present, the rpm decreases and then remains  constant. When carburetor heat is used on an aircraft with a  constant-speed propeller and ice is present, a decrease in the  manifold pressure is noticed, followed by a gradual increase.  If carburetor icing is not present, the gradual increase in  manifold pressure is not apparent until the carburetor heat  is turned off.  

It is imperative for a pilot to recognize carburetor ice when it  forms during flight to prevent a loss in power, altitude, and/or  airspeed. These symptoms may sometimes be accompanied  by vibration or engine roughness. Once a power loss is  noticed, immediate action should be taken to eliminate ice  already formed in the carburetor and to prevent further ice  formation. This is accomplished by applying full carburetor  heat, which will further reduce power and may cause engine  roughness as melted ice goes through the engine. These  symptoms may last from 30 seconds to several minutes,  depending on the severity of the icing. During this period, the  pilot must resist the temptation to decrease the carburetor heat  usage. Carburetor heat must remain in the full-hot position  until normal power returns.  

Since the use of carburetor heat tends to reduce the output  of the engine and to increase the operating temperature,  carburetor heat should not be used when full power is required  (as during takeoff) or during normal engine operation, except  to check for the presence of, or to remove, carburetor ice.  

# Carburetor Air Temperature Gauge  

Some aircraft are equipped with a carburetor air temperature  gauge, which is useful in detecting potential icing conditions.  Usually, the face of the gauge is calibrated in degrees Celsius  with a yellow arc indicating the carburetor air temperatures  where icing may occur. This yellow arc typically ranges  between   $-15\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   and   $+5\,\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  ${5\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}}$   and   $41\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}_{c}$  ). If the air  temperature and moisture content of the air are such that  carburetor icing is improbable, the engine can be operated  with the indicator in the yellow range with no adverse effects.  If the atmospheric conditions are conducive to carburetor  icing, the indicator must be kept outside the yellow arc by  application of carburetor heat.  

Certain carburetor air temperature gauges have a red radial  that indicates the maximum permissible carburetor inlet air  temperature recommended by the engine manufacturer. If  present, a green arc indicates the normal operating range.  

# Outside Air Temperature Gauge  

Most aircraft are also equipped with an outside air  temperature (OAT) gauge calibrated in both degrees  Celsius and Fahrenheit. It provides the outside or ambient  air temperature for calculating true airspeed and is useful in  detecting potential icing conditions.  

# Fuel Injection Systems  

In a fuel injection system, the fuel is injected directly into  the cylinders, or just ahead of the intake valve. The air  intake for the fuel injection system is similar to that used  in a carburetor system, with an alternate air source located  within the engine cowling. This source is used if the external  air source is obstructed. The alternate air source is usually  operated automatically, with a backup manual system that  can be used if the automatic feature malfunctions.  

A fuel injection system usually incorporates six basic  components: an engine-driven fuel pump, a fuel-air control  unit, a fuel manifold (fuel distributor), discharge nozzles,  an auxiliary fuel pump, and fuel pressure/flow indicators.  [Figure 7-13]  

The auxiliary fuel pump provides fuel under pressure to the  fuel-air control unit for engine starting and/or emergency  use. After starting, the engine-driven fuel pump provides fuel  under pressure from the fuel tank to the fuel-air control unit.  

This control unit, which essentially replaces the carburetor,  meters fuel based on the mixture control setting and sends it  to the fuel manifold valve at a rate controlled by the throttle.  

![](images/9886d84e26baaf2da16cfb5f3e2f80fdd40ff3a7a53bbf3d5b6e673f84967a33.jpg)  
Figure 7-13.   Fuel injection system.  

After reaching the fuel manifold valve, the fuel is distributed  to the individual fuel discharge nozzles. The discharge  nozzles, which are located in each cylinder head, inject the  fuel-air mixture directly into each cylinder intake port.  

A fuel injection system is considered to be less susceptible  to icing than a carburetor system, but impact icing on the air  intake is a possibility in either system. Impact icing occurs  when ice forms on the exterior of the aircraft and blocks  openings, such as the air intake for the injection system.  

The following are advantages of using fuel injection:  

•	 Reduction in evaporative icing •	 Better fuel flow •	 Faster throttle response •	 Precise control of mixture •	 Better fuel distribution •	 Easier cold weather starts  

The following are disadvantages of using fuel injection:  

•	 Difficulty in starting a hot engine •	 Vapor locks during ground operations on hot days •	 Problems associated with restarting an engine that  quits because of fuel starvation  

# Superchargers and Turbosupercharger s  

To increase an engine’s horsepower, manufacturers have  developed forced induction systems called supercharger  and turbosupercharger systems. They both compress the  intake air to increase its density. The key difference lies in  the power supply. A supercharger relies on an engine-driven  air pump or compressor, while a turbocharger gets its power  from the exhaust stream that runs through a turbine, which in  turn spins the compressor. Aircraft with these systems have  a manifold pressure gauge, which displays MAP within the  engine’s intake manifold.  

On a standard day at sea level with the engine shut  down, the manifold pressure gauge indicates the ambient  absolute air pressure of   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Because atmospheric  pressure decreases approximately   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   per 1,000 feet of  altitude increase, the manifold pressure gauge indicates  approximately  $24.92\,"\mathrm{Hg}$   at an airport that is 5,000 feet above  sea level with standard day conditions.  

As a normally aspirated aircraft climbs, it eventually reaches  an altitude where the MAP is insufficient for a normal climb.  This altitude limit is known as the aircraft’s service ceiling,  and it is directly affected by the engine’s ability to produce  power. If the induction air entering the engine is pressurized,  or boosted, by either a supercharger or a turbosupercharger,  the aircraft’s service ceiling can be increased. With these  systems, an aircraft can fly at higher altitudes with the  advantage of higher true airspeeds and the increased ability  to circumnavigate adverse weather.  

# Superchargers  

A supercharger is an engine-driven air pump or compressor  that provides compressed air to the engine to provide  additional pressure to the induction air so that the engine can  produce additional power. It increases manifold pressure and  forces the fuel-air mixture into the cylinders. Higher manifold  pressure increases the density of the fuel-air mixture and  increases the power an engine can produce. With a normally  aspirated engine, it is not possible to have manifold pressure  higher than the existing atmospheric pressure. A supercharger  is capable of boosting manifold pressure above  $30\ \mathrm{"Hg}$  .  

For example, at 8,000 feet, a typical engine may be able to  produce 75 percent of the power it could produce at mean  sea level (MSL) because the air is less dense at the higher  altitude. The supercharger compresses the air to a higher  density allowing a supercharged engine to produce the same  manifold pressure at higher altitudes as it could produce  at sea level. Thus, an engine at 8,000 feet MSL could still  produce   $25\ \mathrm{"Hg}$   of manifold pressure whereas, without a  supercharger, it could only produce  $22\ \mathrm{"Hg}$  . Superchargers  are especially valuable at high altitudes (such as 18,000 feet)  where the air density is 50 percent that of sea level. The use  of a supercharger in many cases will supply air to the engine  at the same density it did at sea level.  

The components in a supercharged induction system are similar  to those in a normally aspirated system, with the addition of  a supercharger between the fuel metering device and intake  manifold. A supercharger is driven by the engine through a  gear train at one speed, two speeds, or variable speeds. In  addition, superchargers can have one or more stages. Each  stage also provides an increase in pressure and superchargers  may be classified as single stage, two stage, or multistage,  depending on the number of times compression occurs.  

An early version of a single-stage, single-speed supercharger  may be referred to as a sea-level supercharger. An engine  equipped with this type of supercharger is called a sea-level  engine. With this type of supercharger, a single gear-driven  impeller is used to increase the power produced by an engine  at all altitudes. The drawback with this type of supercharger is  a decrease in engine power output with an increase in altitude.  

Single-stage, single-speed superchargers are found on many  high-powered radial engines and use an air intake that faces  forward so the induction system can take full advantage of  the ram air. Intake air passes through ducts to a carburetor,  where fuel is metered in proportion to the airflow. The  fuel-air charge is then ducted to the supercharger, or blower  impeller, which accelerates the fuel-air mixture outward.  Once accelerated, the fuel-air mixture passes through a  diffuser, where air velocity is traded for pressure energy.  After compression, the resulting high pressure fuel-air  mixture is directed to the cylinders.  

Some of the large radial engines developed during World  War II have a single-stage, two-speed supercharger. With  this type of supercharger, a single impeller may be operated  at two speeds. The low impeller speed is often referred to  as the low blower setting, while the high impeller speed is  called the high blower setting. On engines equipped with a  two-speed supercharger, a lever or switch in the flight deck  activates an oil-operated clutch that switches from one speed  to the other.  

Under normal operations, takeoff is made with the  supercharger in the low blower position. In this mode, the  engine performs as a ground-boosted engine, and the power  output decreases as the aircraft gains altitude. However, once  the aircraft reaches a specified altitude, a power reduction is  made, and the supercharger control is switched to the high  blower position. The throttle is then reset to the desired  manifold pressure. An engine equipped with this type of  supercharger is called an altitude engine.  [Figure 7-14]  

# Turbosupercharger s  

The most efficient method of increasing horsepower in an  engine is by using a turbosupercharger or turbocharger.  

![](images/58a0ba8dccb6506db83fbb7a9721d4a18ac90a9b7f86f5c18bd7fca511c8d1e8.jpg)  
Figure 7-14.  Power output of normally aspirated engine compared  to a single-stage, two-speed supercharged engine.  

Installed on an engine, this booster uses the engine’s exhaust  gases to drive an air compressor to increase the pressure of  the air going into the engine through the carburetor or fuel  injection system to boost power at higher altitude.  

The major disadvantage of the gear-driven supercharger––use  of a large amount of the engine’s power output for the amount  of power increase produced––is avoided with a turbocharger  because turbochargers are powered by an engine’s exhaust  gases. This means a turbocharger recovers energy from hot  exhaust gases that would otherwise be lost.  

A second advantage of turbochargers over superchargers is  the ability to maintain control over an engine’s rated sea- level horsepower from sea level up to the engine’s critical  altitude. Critical altitude is the maximum altitude at which  a turbocharged engine can produce its rated horsepower.  Above the critical altitude, power output begins to decrease  like it does for a normally aspirated engine.  

Turbochargers increase the pressure of the engine’s induction  air, which allows the engine to develop sea level or greater  horsepower at higher altitudes. A turbocharger is comprised  of two main elements: a compressor and turbine. The  compressor section houses an impeller that turns at a high rate  of speed. As induction air is drawn across the impeller blades,  the impeller accelerates the air, allowing a large volume of  air to be drawn into the compressor housing. The impeller’s  action subsequently produces high-pressure, high-density  air that is delivered to the engine. To turn the impeller, the  engine’s exhaust gases are used to drive a turbine wheel  that is mounted on the opposite end of the impeller’s drive  shaft. By directing different amounts of exhaust gases to flow  over the turbine, more energy can be extracted, causing the  impeller to deliver more compressed air to the engine. The  waste gate, essentially an adjustable butterfly valve installed  in the exhaust system, is used to vary the mass of exhaust gas  flowing into the turbine. When closed, most of the exhaust  gases from the engine are forced to flow through the turbine.  When open, the exhaust gases are allowed to bypass the  turbine by flowing directly out through the engine’s exhaust  pipe.  [Figure 7-15]  

Since the temperature of a gas rises when it is compressed,  turbocharging causes the temperature of the induction air to  increase. To reduce this temperature and lower the risk of  detonation, many turbocharged engines use an intercooler.  This small heat exchanger uses outside air to cool the hot  compressed air before it enters the fuel metering device.  

![](images/9a93e28ae79b1bc5e4ee13892d38825c9da17d3c427458eaea06987aa18f3960.jpg)  
Figure 7-15.   Turbocharger components.  

# System Operation  

On most modern turbocharged engines, the position of  the waste gate is governed by a pressure-sensing control  mechanism coupled to an actuator. Engine oil directed into  or away from this actuator moves the waste gate position.  On these systems, the actuator is automatically positioned to  produce the desired MAP simply by changing the position  of the throttle control.  

Other turbocharging system designs use a separate manual  control to position the waste gate. With manual control,  the manifold pressure gauge must be closely monitored to  determine when the desired MAP has been achieved. Manual  systems are often found on aircraft that have been modified  with aftermarket turbocharging systems. These systems  require special operating considerations. For example, if the  waste gate is left closed after descending from a high altitude,  it is possible to produce a manifold pressure that exceeds the  engine’s limitations. This condition, called an overboost,  may produce severe detonation because of the leaning effect  resulting from increased air density during descent.  

Although an automatic waste gate system is less likely to  experience an overboost condition, it can still occur. If takeoff  power is applied while the engine oil temperature is below its  normal operating range, the cold oil may not flow out of the  waste gate actuator quickly enough to prevent an overboost.  To help prevent overboosting, advance the throttle cautiously  to prevent exceeding the maximum manifold pressure limits.  

A pilot flying an aircraft with a turbocharger should be aware  of system limitations. For example, a turbocharger turbine  and impeller can operate at rotational speeds in excess of   $80{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$   while at extremely high temperatures. To achieve  high rotational speed, the bearings within the system must be  constantly supplied with engine oil to reduce the frictional  forces and high temperature. To obtain adequate lubrication,  the oil temperature should be in the normal operating range  before high throttle settings are applied. In addition, allow  the turbocharger to cool and the turbine to slow down before  shutting the engine down. Otherwise, the oil remaining in  the bearing housing will boil, causing hard carbon deposits  to form on the bearings and shaft. These deposits rapidly  deteriorate the turbocharger’s efficiency and service life. For  further limitations, refer to the AFM/POH.  

# High Altitude Performance  

As an aircraft equipped with a turbocharging system climbs,  the waste gate is gradually closed to maintain the maximum  allowable manifold pressure. At some point, the waste gate  is fully closed and further increases in altitude cause the  manifold pressure to decrease. This is the critical altitude,  which is established by the aircraft or engine manufacturer.  When evaluating the performance of the turbocharging  system, be aware that if the manifold pressure begins  decreasing before the specified critical altitude, the engine  and turbocharging system should be inspected by a qualified  aviation maintenance technician (AMT) to verify that the  system is operating properly.  

# Ignition System  

In a spark ignition engine, the ignition system provides a  spark that ignites the fuel-air mixture in the cylinders and is  made up of magnetos, spark plugs, high-tension leads, and  an ignition switch.  [Figure 7-16]  

A magneto uses a permanent magnet to generate an electrical  current completely independent of the aircraft’s electrical  system. The magneto generates sufficiently high voltage  to jump a spark across the spark plug gap in each cylinder.  The system begins to fire when the starter is engaged and the  crankshaft begins to turn. It continues to operate whenever  the crankshaft is rotating.  

Most standard certificated aircraft incorporate a dual ignition  system with two individual magnetos, separate sets of wires,  and spark plugs to increase reliability of the ignition system.  Each magneto operates independently to fire one of the two  spark plugs in each cylinder. The firing of two spark plugs  improves combustion of the fuel-air mixture and results in a  slightly higher power output. If one of the magnetos fails, the  other is unaffected. The engine continues to operate normally,  although a slight decrease in engine power can be expected.  The same is true if one of the two spark plugs in a cylinder fails.  

The operation of the magneto is controlled in the flight deck  by the ignition switch. The switch has five positions:  

1. 	 OFF 2. 	 R (right) 3. 	 L (left) 4. 	 BOTH 5. 	 START  

With RIGHT or LEFT selected, only the associated magneto  is activated. The system operates on both magnetos when  BOTH is selected.  

A malfunctioning ignition system can be identified during  the pretakeoff check by observing the decrease in rpm that  occurs when the ignition switch is first moved from BOTH  to RIGHT and then from BOTH to LEFT. A small decrease  in engine rpm is normal during this check. The permissible  decrease is listed in the AFM or POH. If the engine stops  running when switched to one magneto or if the rpm drop  exceeds the allowable limit, do not fly the aircraft until  the problem is corrected. The cause could be fouled plugs,  

![](images/a831d1969d6a9ef5bd795837fe3f2f972b709463efa0c35305941ac9149c2210.jpg)  
Figure 7-16.   Ignition system components.  

broken or shorted wires between the magneto and the plugs,  or improperly timed firing of the plugs. It should be noted  that “no drop” in rpm is not normal, and in that instance, the  aircraft should not be flown.  

Following engine shutdown, turn the ignition switch to the  OFF position. Even with the battery and master switches  OFF, the engine can fire and turn over if the ignition switch  is left ON and the propeller is moved because the magneto  requires no outside source of electrical power. Be aware of  the potential for serious injury in this situation.  

Even with the ignition switch in the OFF position, if  the ground wire between the magneto and the ignition  switch becomes disconnected or broken, the engine could  accidentally start if the propeller is moved with residual fuel  in the cylinder. If this occurs, the only way to stop the engine  is to move the mixture lever to the idle cutoff position, then  have the system checked by a qualified AMT.  

# Oil Systems  

The engine oil system performs several important functions:  

•	 Lubrication of the engine’s moving parts •	 Cooling of the engine by reducing friction •	 Removing heat from the cylinders •	 Providing a seal between the cylinder walls and pistons •	 Carrying away contaminants  

Reciprocating engines use either a wet-sump or a dry-sump  oil system. In a wet-sump system, the oil is located in a sump  that is an integral part of the engine. In a dry-sump system,  the oil is contained in a separate tank and circulated through  the engine by pumps.  [Figure 7-17]  

The main component of a wet-sump system is the oil pump,  which draws oil from the sump and routes it to the engine. After  the oil passes through the engine, it returns to the sump. In  some engines, additional lubrication is supplied by the rotating  crankshaft, which splashes oil onto portions of the engine.  

An oil pump also supplies oil pressure in a dry-sump  system, but the source of the oil is located external to the  engine in a separate oil tank. After oil is routed through  the engine, it is pumped from the various locations in the  engine back to the oil tank by scavenge pumps. Dry-sump  systems allow for a greater volume of oil to be supplied to  the engine, which makes them more suitable for very large  reciprocating engines.  

The oil pressure gauge provides a direct indication of the oil  system operation. It ensures the pressure in pounds per square  inch (psi) of the oil supplied to the engine. Green indicates  the normal operating range, while red indicates the minimum  and maximum pressures. There should be an indication of  oil pressure during engine start. Refer to the AFM/POH for  manufacturer limitations.  

![](images/f9a3bc152618986a3b5b3139d4e3d130426ff50858ab939f97951288ccf17403.jpg)  
Figure 7-17.  Wet-sump oil system.  

The oil temperature gauge measures the temperature of oil.  A green area shows the normal operating range, and the red  line indicates the maximum allowable temperature. Unlike  oil pressure, changes in oil temperature occur more slowly.  This is particularly noticeable after starting a cold engine,  when it may take several minutes or longer for the gauge to  show any increase in oil temperature.  

Check oil temperature periodically during flight especially  when operating in high or low ambient air temperature.  High oil temperature indications may signal a plugged oil  line, a low oil quantity, a blocked oil cooler, or a defective  temperature gauge. Low oil temperature indications may  signal improper oil viscosity during cold weather operations.  

The oil filler cap and dipstick (for measuring the oil quantity)  are usually accessible through a panel in the engine cowling. If  the quantity does not meet the manufacturer’s recommended  operating levels, oil should be added. The AFM/POH or  placards near the access panel provide information about  the correct oil type and weight, as well as the minimum and  maximum oil quantity.  [Figure 7-18]  

# Engine Cooling Systems  

The burning fuel within the cylinders produces intense  heat, most of which is expelled through the exhaust system.  Much of the remaining heat, however, must be removed, or  at least dissipated, to prevent the engine from overheating.  Otherwise, the extremely high engine temperatures can lead  to loss of power, excessive oil consumption, detonation, and  serious engine damage.  

While the oil system is vital to the internal cooling of the  engine, an additional method of cooling is necessary for the  engine’s external surface. Most small aircraft are air cooled,  although some are liquid cooled.  

![](images/e9988a05d9363687c9f268f2af418bea0459416471bd834ece18149f0656243e.jpg)  
Figure 7-18.  Always check the engine oil level during the preflight  inspection.  

Air cooling is accomplished by air flowing into the engine  compartment through openings in front of the engine  cowling. Baffles route this air over fins attached to the engine  cylinders, and other parts of the engine, where the air absorbs  the engine heat. Expulsion of the hot air takes place through  one or more openings in the lower, aft portion of the engine  cowling.  [Figure 7-19]  

The outside air enters the engine compartment through an  inlet behind the propeller hub. Baffles direct it to the hottest  parts of the engine, primarily the cylinders, which have fins  that increase the area exposed to the airflow.  

The air cooling system is less effective during ground  operations, takeoffs, go-arounds, and other periods of high- power, low-airspeed operation. Conversely, high-speed  descents provide excess air and can shock cool the engine,  subjecting it to abrupt temperature fluctuations.  

Operating the engine at higher than its designed temperature  can cause loss of power, excessive oil consumption, and  detonation. It will also lead to serious permanent damage,  such as scoring the cylinder walls, damaging the pistons and  rings, and burning and warping the valves. Monitoring the  flight deck engine temperature instruments aids in avoiding  high operating temperature.  

Under normal operating conditions in aircraft not equipped  with cowl flaps, the engine temperature can be controlled  

![](images/23f88792089e7a22e496bdc033e2dcb17035617bff2d1e2dd867bd293a475a7e.jpg)  
Figure 7-19.  Outside air aids in cooling the engine.  

by changing the airspeed or the power output of the engine.  High engine temperatures can be decreased by increasing the  airspeed and/or reducing the power.  

The oil temperature gauge gives an indirect and delayed  indication of rising engine temperature, but can be used  for determining engine temperature if this is the only  means available.  

Most aircraft are equipped with a cylinder-head temperature  gauge that indicates a direct and immediate cylinder  temperature change. This instrument is calibrated in degrees  Celsius or Fahrenheit and is usually color coded with a green  arc to indicate the normal operating range. A red line on  the instrument indicates maximum allowable cylinder head  temperature.  

To avoid excessive cylinder head temperatures, increase  airspeed, enrich the fuel-air mixture, and/or reduce  power. Any of these procedures help to reduce the engine  temperature. On aircraft equipped with cowl flaps, use the  cowl flap positions to control the temperature. Cowl flaps  are hinged covers that fit over the opening through which the  hot air is expelled. If the engine temperature is low, the cowl  flaps can be closed, thereby restricting the flow of expelled  hot air and increasing engine temperature. If the engine  temperature is high, the cowl flaps can be opened to permit  a greater flow of air through the system, thereby decreasing  the engine temperature.  

# Exhaust Systems  

Engine exhaust systems vent the burned combustion gases  overboard, provide heat for the cabin, and defrost the  windscreen. An exhaust system has exhaust piping attached  to the cylinders, as well as a muffler and a muffler shroud.  The exhaust gases are pushed out of the cylinder through  the exhaust valve and then through the exhaust pipe system  to the atmosphere.  

For cabin heat, outside air is drawn into the air inlet and is  ducted through a shroud around the muffler. The muffler is  heated by the exiting exhaust gases and, in turn, heats the  air around the muffler. This heated air is then ducted to the  cabin for heat and defrost applications. The heat and defrost  are controlled in the flight deck and can be adjusted to the  desired level.  

Exhaust gases contain large amounts of carbon monoxide,  which is odorless and colorless. Carbon monoxide is deadly,  and its presence is virtually impossible to detect. To ensure  that exhaust gases are properly expelled, the exhaust system  must be in good condition and free of cracks.  

Some exhaust systems have an EGT probe. This probe  transmits the EGT to an instrument in the flight deck. The  EGT gauge measures the temperature of the gases at the  exhaust manifold. This temperature varies with the ratio of  fuel to air entering the cylinders and can be used as a basis  for regulating the fuel-air mixture. The EGT gauge is highly  accurate in indicating the correct fuel-air mixture setting.  When using the EGT to aid in leaning the fuel-air mixture,  fuel consumption can be reduced. For specific procedures,  refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for leaning the  fuel-air mixture.  

# Starting System  

Most small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric starter  system. This system consists of a source of electricity, wiring,  switches, and solenoids to operate the starter and a starter  motor. Most aircraft have starters that automatically engage  and disengage when operated, but some older aircraft have  starters that are mechanically engaged by a lever actuated by  the pilot. The starter engages the aircraft flywheel, rotating  the engine at a speed that allows the engine to start and  maintain operation.  

Electrical power for starting is usually supplied by an onboard  battery, but can also be supplied by external power through  an external power receptacle. When the battery switch is  turned on, electricity is supplied to the main power bus bar  through the battery solenoid. Both the starter and the starter  switch draw current from the main bus bar, but the starter  will not operate until the starting solenoid is energized by  the starter switch being turned to the “start” position. When  the starter switch is released from the “start” position, the  solenoid removes power from the starter motor. The starter  motor is protected from being driven by the engine through a  clutch in the starter drive that allows the engine to run faster  than the starter motor.  [Figure 7-20]  

When starting an engine, the rules of safety and courtesy  should be strictly observed. One of the most important safety  rules is to ensure there is no one near the propeller prior to  starting the engine. In addition, the wheels should be chocked  and the brakes set to avoid hazards caused by unintentional  movement. To avoid damage to the propeller and property,  the aircraft should be in an area where the propeller will not  stir up gravel or dust.  

# Combustion  

During normal combustion, the fuel-air mixture burns in a  very controlled and predictable manner. In a spark ignition  engine, the process occurs in a fraction of a second. The  mixture actually begins to burn at the point where it is ignited  

![](images/e9c51cb4f91e4a91e8cec788e0b147c2a2703faaa0a189f34955d2c144bd6738.jpg)  
Figure 7-20.  Typical starting circuit.  

by the spark plugs. It then burns away from the plugs until it  is completely consumed. This type of combustion causes a  smooth build-up of temperature and pressure and ensures that  the expanding gases deliver the maximum force to the piston  at exactly the right time in the power stroke.  [Figure 7-21] Detonation is an uncontrolled, explosive ignition of the  fuel-air mixture within the cylinder’s combustion chamber.  It causes excessive temperatures and pressures which, if not  corrected, can quickly lead to failure of the piston, cylinder,  or valves. In less severe cases, detonation causes engine  overheating, roughness, or loss of power.  

Detonation is characterized by high cylinder head temperatures  and is most likely to occur when operating at high power  settings. Common operational causes of detonation are:  

•	 Use of a lower fuel grade than that specified by the  aircraft manufacturer •	 Operation of the engine with extremely high manifold  pressures in conjunction with low rpm •	 Operation of the engine at high power settings with  an excessively lean mixture  

![](images/fb9df3f41fe4bb061a4a63fd385610f1762d8314596ced4ce7e7fa8ab325ab33.jpg)  
Figure 7-21.  Normal combustion and explosive combustion.  

•	 Maintaining extended ground operations or steep  climbs in which cylinder cooling is reduced  

Detonation may be avoided by following these basic  guidelines during the various phases of ground and flight  operations:  

•	 Ensure that the proper grade of fuel is used. •	 Keep the cowl flaps (if available) in the full-open  position while on the ground to provide the maximum  airflow through the cowling. •	 Use an enriched fuel mixture, as well as a shallow  climb angle, to increase cylinder cooling during  takeoff and initial climb. •	 Avoid extended, high power, steep climbs. •	 Develop the habit of monitoring the engine instruments  to verify proper operation according to procedures  established by the manufacturer.  

Preignition occurs when the fuel-air mixture ignites prior  to the engine’s normal ignition event. Premature burning  is usually caused by a residual hot spot in the combustion  chamber, often created by a small carbon deposit on a spark  plug, a cracked spark plug insulator, or other damage in the  cylinder that causes a part to heat sufficiently to ignite the  fuel-air charge. Preignition causes the engine to lose power  and produces high operating temperature. As with detonation,  preignition may also cause severe engine damage because  the expanding gases exert excessive pressure on the piston  while still on its compression stroke.  

Detonation and preignition often occur simultaneously and  one may cause the other. Since either condition causes high  engine temperature accompanied by a decrease in engine  performance, it is often difficult to distinguish between the  two. Using the recommended grade of fuel and operating  the engine within its proper temperature, pressure, and rpm  ranges reduce the chance of detonation or preignition.  

# Full Authority Digital Engine Control  (FADEC)  

FADEC is a system consisting of a digital computer and  ancillary components that control an aircraft’s engine  and propeller. First used in turbine-powered aircraft, and  referred to as full authority digital electronic control, these  sophisticated control systems are increasingly being used in  piston powered aircraft.  

In a spark-ignition reciprocating engine, the FADEC uses  speed, temperature, and pressure sensors to monitor the status  of each cylinder. A digital computer calculates the ideal pulse  for each injector and adjusts ignition timing as necessary  to achieve optimal performance. In a compression-ignition  engine, the FADEC operates similarly and performs all of  the same functions, excluding those specifically related to  the spark ignition process.  

FADEC systems eliminate the need for magnetos, carburetor  heat, mixture controls, and engine priming. A single throttle  lever is characteristic of an aircraft equipped with a FADEC  system. The pilot simply positions the throttle lever to a  desired detent, such as start, idle, cruise power, or max power,  and the FADEC system adjusts the engine and propeller  automatically for the mode selected. There is no need for the  pilot to monitor or control the fuel-air mixture.  

During aircraft starting, the FADEC primes the cylinders,  adjusts the mixture, and positions the throttle based on engine  temperature and ambient pressure. During cruise flight, the  FADEC constantly monitors the engine and adjusts fuel flow  and ignition timing individually in each cylinder. This precise  control of the combustion process often results in decreased  fuel consumption and increased horsepower.  

FADEC systems are considered an essential part of the  engine and propeller control and may be powered by the  aircraft’s main electrical system. In many aircraft, FADEC  uses power from a separate generator connected to the engine.  In either case, there must be a backup electrical source  available because failure of a FADEC system could result in a  complete loss of engine thrust. To prevent loss of thrust, two  separate and identical digital channels are incorporated for  redundancy. Each channel is capable of providing all engine  and propeller functions without limitations.  

# Turbine Engines  

An aircraft turbine engine consists of an air inlet, compressor,  combustion chambers, a turbine section, and exhaust. Thrust  is produced by increasing the velocity of the air flowing  through the engine. Turbine engines are highly desirable  aircraft powerplants. They are characterized by smooth  operation and a high power-to-weight ratio, and they  use readily available jet fuel. Prior to recent advances in  material, engine design, and manufacturing processes, the  use of turbine engines in small/light production aircraft was  cost prohibitive. Today, several aviation manufacturers are  producing or plan to produce small/light turbine-powered  aircraft. These smaller turbine-powered aircraft typically  seat between three and seven passengers and are referred to  as very light jets (VLJs) or microjets.  [Figure 7-22]  

# Types of Turbine Engines  

Turbine engines are classified according to the type of  compressors they use. There are three types of compressors— centrifugal flow, axial flow, and centrifugal-axial flow.  Compression of inlet air is achieved in a centrifugal flow  engine by accelerating air outward perpendicular to the  longitudinal axis of the machine. The axial-flow engine  compresses air by a series of rotating and stationary  airfoils moving the air parallel to the longitudinal axis. The  centrifugal-axial flow design uses both kinds of compressors  to achieve the desired compression.  

The path the air takes through the engine and how power is  produced determines the type of engine. There are four types  of aircraft turbine engines—turbojet, turboprop, turbofan,  and turboshaft.  

# Turbojet  

The turbojet engine consists of four sections—compressor,  combustion chamber, turbine section, and exhaust. The  compressor section passes inlet air at a high rate of speed to  

![](images/02e2edbf87418eb8d7e8e3627be00d83e3358600d44007f7bbd4870b8ca6e9fe.jpg)  
Figure 7-22.  Eclipse 500 VLJ.  

the combustion chamber. The combustion chamber contains  the fuel inlet and igniter for combustion. The expanding  air drives a turbine, which is connected by a shaft to the  compressor, sustaining engine operation. The accelerated  exhaust gases from the engine provide thrust. This is a basic  application of compressing air, igniting the fuel-air mixture,  producing power to self-sustain the engine operation, and  exhaust for propulsion.  [Figure 7-23]  

Turbojet engines are limited in range and endurance. They  are also slow to respond to throttle applications at slow  compressor speeds.  

# Turboprop  

A turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives a propeller  through a reduction gear. The exhaust gases drive a power  turbine connected by a shaft that drives the reduction gear  assembly. Reduction gearing is necessary in turboprop  engines because optimum propeller performance is achieved  at much slower speeds than the engine’s operating rpm.  Turboprop engines are a compromise between turbojet  engines and reciprocating powerplants. Turboprop engines  are most efficient at speeds between 250 and   $400\;\mathrm{mph}$   and  altitudes between 18,000 and 30,000 feet. They also perform  well at the slow airspeeds required for takeoff and landing and  are fuel efficient. The minimum specific fuel consumption  of the turboprop engine is normally available in the altitude  range of 25,000 feet to the tropopause.  [Figure 7-24]  

# Turbofan  

Turbofans were developed to combine some of the best  features of the turbojet and the turboprop. Turbofan engines  are designed to create additional thrust by diverting a  secondary airflow around the combustion chamber. The  turbofan bypass air generates increased thrust, cools the  engine, and aids in exhaust noise suppression. This provides  turbojet-type cruise speed and lower fuel consumption.  

The inlet air that passes through a turbofan engine is usually  divided into two separate streams of air. One stream passes  through the engine core, while a second stream bypasses the  engine core. It is this bypass stream of air that is responsible  for the term “bypass engine.” A turbofan’s bypass ratio refers  to the ratio of the mass airflow that passes through the fan  divided by the mass airflow that passes through the engine  core.  [Figure 7-25]  

# Turboshaft  

The fourth common type of jet engine is the turboshaft.  [Figure 7-26]  It delivers power to a shaft that drives  something other than a propeller. The biggest difference  between a turbojet and turboshaft engine is that on a

Figure 7-26.  Turboshaft engine.  

turboshaft engine, most of the energy produced by the  expanding gases is used to drive a turbine rather than produce  thrust. Many helicopters use a turboshaft gas turbine engine.  In addition, turboshaft engines are widely used as auxiliary  power units on large aircraft.  

# Turbine Engine Instruments  

Engine instruments that indicate oil pressure, oil temperature,  engine speed, exhaust gas temperature, and fuel flow are  common to both turbine and reciprocating engines. However,  there are some instruments that are unique to turbine engines.  These instruments provide indications of engine pressure  ratio, turbine discharge pressure, and torque. In addition,  most gas turbine engines have multiple temperature-sensing  instruments, called thermocouples, which provide pilots with  temperature readings in and around the turbine section.  

# Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR)  

An engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge is used to indicate the  power output of a turbojet/turbofan engine. EPR is the ratio  of turbine discharge to compressor inlet pressure. Pressure  measurements are recorded by probes installed in the engine  inlet and at the exhaust. Once collected, the data is sent to  a differential pressure transducer, which is indicated on a  flight deck EPR gauge.  

EPR system design automatically compensates for the effects  of airspeed and altitude. Changes in ambient temperature  require a correction be applied to EPR indications to provide  accurate engine power settings.  

# Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)  

A limiting factor in a gas turbine engine is the temperature  of the turbine section. The temperature of a turbine section  must be monitored closely to prevent overheating the turbine  blades and other exhaust section components. One common  way of monitoring the temperature of a turbine section is  with an EGT gauge. EGT is an engine operating limit used  to monitor overall engine operating conditions.  

Variations of EGT systems bear different names based on  the location of the temperature sensors. Common turbine  temperature sensing gauges include the turbine inlet  temperature (TIT) gauge, turbine outlet temperature (TOT)  gauge, interstage turbine temperature (ITT) gauge, and  turbine gas temperature (TGT) gauge.  

# Torquemeter  

Turboprop/turboshaft engine power output is measured  by the torquemeter. Torque is a twisting force applied to a  shaft. The torquemeter measures power applied to the shaft.  

Turboprop and turboshaft engines are designed to produce  torque for driving a propeller. Torquemeters are calibrated  in percentage units, foot-pounds, or psi.  

#  $N_{I}$   Indicator  

$\mathbf{N}_{1}$   represents the rotational speed of the low pressure  compressor and is presented on the indicator as a percentage  of design rpm. After start, the speed of the low pressure  compressor is governed by the   $\mathbf{N}_{1}$   turbine wheel. The   $\mathbf{N}_{1}$    turbine wheel is connected to the low pressure compressor  through a concentric shaft.  

#  $N_{2}$   Indicator  

$\mathbf{N}_{2}$   represents the rotational speed of the high pressure  compressor and is presented on the indicator as a percentage of  design rpm. The high pressure compressor is governed by the   $\mathbf{N}_{2}$   turbine wheel. The  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$   turbine wheel is connected to the high  pressure compressor through a concentric shaft.  [Figure 7-27]  

# Turbine Engine Operational Considerations  

The great variety of turbine engines makes it impractical to  cover specific operational procedures, but there are certain  operational considerations common to all turbine engines.  They are engine temperature limits, foreign object damage,  hot start, compressor stall, and flameout.  

# Engine Temperature Limitations  

The highest temperature in any turbine engine occurs at the  turbine inlet. TIT is therefore usually the limiting factor in  turbine engine operation.  

# Thrust Variations  

Turbine engine thrust varies directly with air density. As air  density decreases, so does thrust. Additionally, because air  density decreases with an increase in temperature, increased  

![](images/64b570b0d35eba8984ca70878c441c6c5e399d2d1157cadfe0d0e435379467d0.jpg)  
Figure 7-27.  Dual-spool axial-flow compressor.  

temperatures also results in decreased thrust. While both  turbine and reciprocating powered engines are affected to  some degree by high relative humidity, turbine engines will  experience a negligible loss of thrust, while reciprocating  engines a significant loss of brake horsepower.  

# Foreign Object Damage (FOD)  

Due to the design and function of a turbine engine’s air inlet,  the possibility of ingestion of debris always exists. This  causes significant damage, particularly to the compressor  and turbine sections. When ingestion of debris occurs, it is  called foreign object damage (FOD). Typical FOD consists  of small nicks and dents caused by ingestion of small objects  from the ramp, taxiway, or runway, but FOD damage caused  by bird strikes or ice ingestion also occur. Sometimes FOD  results in total destruction of an engine.  

Prevention of FOD is a high priority. Some engine inlets  have a tendency to form a vortex between the ground and  the inlet during ground operations. A vortex dissipater may  be installed on these engines. Other devices, such as screens  and/or deflectors, may also be utilized. Preflight procedures  include a visual inspection for any sign of FOD.  

# Turbine Engine Hot/Hung Start  

When the EGT exceeds the safe limit of an aircraft, it  experiences a “hot start.” This is caused by too much fuel  entering the combustion chamber or insufficient turbine rpm.  Any time an engine has a hot start, refer to the AFM/POH or an  appropriate maintenance manual for inspection requirements.  

If the engine fails to accelerate to the proper speed after  ignition or does not accelerate to idle rpm, a hung or false start  has occurred. A hung start may be caused by an insufficient  starting power source or fuel control malfunction.  

# Compressor Stalls  

Compressor blades are small airfoils and are subject to the  same aerodynamic principles that apply to any airfoil. A  compressor blade has an AOA that is a result of inlet air  velocity and the compressor’s rotational velocity. These two  forces combine to form a vector, which defines the airfoil’s  actual AOA to the approaching inlet air.  

A compressor stall is an imbalance between the two vector  quantities, inlet velocity, and compressor rotational speed.  Compressor stalls occur when the compressor blades’ AOA  exceeds the critical AOA. At this point, smooth airflow  is interrupted and turbulence is created with pressure  fluctuations. Compressor stalls cause air flowing in the  compressor to slow down and stagnate, sometimes reversing  direction.  [Figure 7-28]  

![](images/961d851c3322a54c0fe4a7101e0f27b66b8e5ba574bada3b63258f837e470482.jpg)  
Figure 7-28.  Comparison of normal and distorted airflow into the  compressor section.  

Compressor stalls can be transient and intermittent or steady  and severe. Indications of a transient/intermittent stall are  usually an intermittent “bang” as backfire and flow reversal  take place. If the stall develops and becomes steady, strong  vibration and a loud roar may develop from the continuous  flow reversal. Often, the flight deck gauges do not show  a mild or transient stall, but they do indicate a developed  stall. Typical instrument indications include fluctuations  in rpm and an increase in exhaust gas temperature. Most  transient stalls are not harmful to the engine and often correct  themselves after one or two pulsations. The possibility of  severe engine damage from a steady state stall is immediate.  Recovery must be accomplished by quickly reducing power,  decreasing the aircraft’s AOA, and increasing airspeed.  

Although all gas turbine engines are subject to compressor  stalls, most models have systems that inhibit them. One  system uses a variable inlet guide vane (VIGV) and variable  stator vanes that direct the incoming air into the rotor blades  at an appropriate angle. To prevent air pressure stalls,  operate the aircraft within the parameters established by the  manufacturer. If a compressor stall does develop, follow the  procedures recommended in the AFM/POH.  

# Flameout  

A flameout occurs in the operation of a gas turbine engine in  which the fire in the engine unintentionally goes out. If the  rich limit of the fuel-air ratio is exceeded in the combustion  chamber, the flame will blow out. This condition is often  referred to as a rich flameout. It generally results from  very fast engine acceleration where an overly rich mixture  causes the fuel temperature to drop below the combustion  temperature. It may also be caused by insufficient airflow  to support combustion.  

A more common flameout occurrence is due to low fuel  pressure and low engine speeds, which typically are  associated with high-altitude flight. This situation may also  occur with the engine throttled back during a descent, which  can set up the lean-condition flameout. A weak mixture can  easily cause the flame to die out, even with a normal airflow  through the engine.  

Any interruption of the fuel supply can result in a  flameout. This may be due to prolonged unusual attitudes,  a malfunctioning fuel control system, turbulence, icing, or  running out of fuel.  

Symptoms of a flameout normally are the same as those  following an engine failure. If the flameout is due to a  transitory condition, such as an imbalance between fuel  flow and engine speed, an airstart may be attempted once  the condition is corrected. In any case, pilots must follow  the applicable emergency procedures outlined in the AFM/ POH. Generally these procedures contain recommendations  concerning altitude and airspeed where the airstart is most  likely to be successful.  

# Performance Comparison  

It is possible to compare the performance of a reciprocating  powerplant and different types of turbine engines. For  the comparison to be accurate, thrust horsepower (usable  horsepower) for the reciprocating powerplant must be used  rather than brake horsepower, and net thrust must be used  for the turbine-powered engines. In addition, aircraft design  configuration and size must be approximately the same.  

When comparing performance, the following definitions  are useful:  

•	 Brake horsepower (BHP)—the horsepower actually  delivered to the output shaft. Brake horsepower is the  actual usable horsepower.  •	 Net thrust—the thrust produced by a turbojet or  turbofan engine. •	 Thrust horsepower (THP)—the horsepower equivalent  of the thrust produced by a turbojet or turbofan engine.  

Equivalent shaft horsepower (ESHP)—with respect  to turboprop engines, the sum of the shaft horsepower  (SHP) delivered to the propeller and THP produced by the  exhaust gases.  

Figure 7-29  shows how four types of engines compare in net  thrust as airspeed is increased. This figure is for explanatory  

![](images/5aa1388f44e884f521004e23b9e328b4ba55fe8827e42a6d24a2faa3c84a0df8.jpg)  
Figure 7-29.  Engine net thrust versus aircraft speed and drag. Points  A  through  F  are explained in the text below.  

purposes only and is not for specific models of engines. The  following are the four types of engines:  

•	 Reciprocating powerplant •	 Turbine, propeller combination (turboprop) •	 Turbine engine incorporating a fan (turbofan) •	 Turbojet (pure jet)  

By plotting the performance curve for each engine, a  comparison can be made of maximum aircraft speed variation  with the type of engine used. Since the graph is only a means  of comparison, numerical values for net thrust, aircraft speed,  and drag are not included.  

Comparison of the four powerplants on the basis of net thrust  makes certain performance capabilities evident. In the speed  range shown to the left of line A, the reciprocating powerplant  outperforms the other three types. The turboprop outperforms  the turbofan in the range to the left of line C. The turbofan  engine outperforms the turbojet in the range to the left of  line F. The turbofan engine outperforms the reciprocating  powerplant to the right of line B and the turboprop to the  right of line C. The turbojet outperforms the reciprocating  powerplant to the right of line D, the turboprop to the right  of line E, and the turbofan to the right of line F.  

The points where the aircraft drag curve intersects the net  thrust curves are the maximum aircraft speeds. The vertical  lines from each of the points to the baseline of the graph  indicate that the turbojet aircraft can attain a higher maximum  speed than aircraft equipped with the other types of engines.  Aircraft equipped with the turbofan engine attains a higher  maximum speed than aircraft equipped with a turboprop or  reciprocating powerplant.  

# Airframe Systems  

Fuel, electrical, hydraulic, and oxygen systems make up the  airframe systems.  

# Fuel Systems  

The fuel system is designed to provide an uninterrupted  flow of clean fuel from the fuel tanks to the engine. The  fuel must be available to the engine under all conditions  of engine power, altitude, attitude, and during all approved  flight maneuvers. Two common classifications apply to fuel  systems in small aircraft: gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems.  

# Gravity-Feed System  

The gravity-feed system utilizes the force of gravity to  transfer the fuel from the tanks to the engine. For example, on  high-wing airplanes, the fuel tanks are installed in the wings.  This places the fuel tanks above the carburetor, and the fuel  is gravity fed through the system and into the carburetor. If  the design of the aircraft is such that gravity cannot be used  to transfer fuel, fuel pumps are installed. For example, on  low-wing airplanes, the fuel tanks in the wings are located  below the carburetor.  [Figure 7-30]  

# Fuel-Pump System  

Aircraft with fuel-pump systems have two fuel pumps. The  main pump system is engine driven with an electrically- driven auxiliary pump provided for use in engine starting  and in the event the engine pump fails. The auxiliary pump,  also known as a boost pump, provides added reliability to  the fuel system. The electrically-driven auxiliary pump is  controlled by a switch in the flight deck.  

# Fuel Primer  

Both gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems may incorporate a  fuel primer into the system. The fuel primer is used to draw  fuel from the tanks to vaporize fuel directly into the cylinders  prior to starting the engine. During cold weather, when  engines are difficult to start, the fuel primer helps because  there is not enough heat available to vaporize the fuel in the  carburetor. It is important to lock the primer in place when  it is not in use. If the knob is free to move, it may vibrate  out of position during flight which may cause an excessively  rich fuel-air mixture. To avoid overpriming, read the priming  instructions for the aircraft.  

# Fuel Tanks  

The fuel tanks, normally located inside the wings of an  airplane, have a filler opening on top of the wing through  which they can be filled. A filler cap covers this opening.  

![](images/cf4e26866b8e3501536db7edbe6dd98539b11b387b162f3f60b0e9d041f39e76.jpg)  
Figure 7-30.  Gravity-feed and fuel-pump systems.  

The tanks are vented to the outside to maintain atmospheric  pressure inside the tank. They may be vented through the  filler cap or through a tube extending through the surface  of the wing. Fuel tanks also include an overflow drain that  may stand alone or be collocated with the fuel tank vent.  This allows fuel to expand with increases in temperature  without damage to the tank itself. If the tanks have been  filled on a hot day, it is not unusual to see fuel coming from  the overflow drain.  

# Fuel Gauges  

The fuel quantity gauges indicate the amount of fuel  measured by a sensing unit in each fuel tank and is displayed  in gallons or pounds. Aircraft certification rules require  accuracy in fuel gauges only when they read “empty.” Any  reading other than “empty” should be verified. Do not depend  solely on the accuracy of the fuel quantity gauges. Always  visually check the fuel level in each tank during the preflight  inspection, and then compare it with the corresponding fuel  quantity indication.  

If a fuel pump is installed in the fuel system, a fuel pressure  gauge is also included. This gauge indicates the pressure in  the fuel lines. The normal operating pressure can be found  in the AFM/POH or on the gauge by color coding.  

# Fuel Selectors  

The fuel selector valve allows selection of fuel from various  tanks. A common type of selector valve contains four  positions: LEFT, RIGHT, BOTH, and OFF. Selecting the  LEFT or RIGHT position allows fuel to feed only from the  respective tank, while selecting the BOTH position feeds  fuel from both tanks. The LEFT or RIGHT position may be  used to balance the amount of fuel remaining in each wing  tank.  [Figure 7-31]  

Fuel placards show any limitations on fuel tank usage, such  as “level flight only” and/or “both” for landings and takeoffs.  

Regardless of the type of fuel selector in use, fuel  consumption should be monitored closely to ensure that a  tank does not run completely out of fuel. Running a fuel tank  dry does not only cause the engine to stop, but running for  prolonged periods on one tank causes an unbalanced fuel load  between tanks. Running a tank completely dry may allow air  to enter the fuel system and cause vapor lock, which makes  it difficult to restart the engine. On fuel-injected engines, the  fuel becomes so hot it vaporizes in the fuel line, not allowing  fuel to reach the cylinders.  

![](images/3a6f4595019842cff999ddf52498a9a62aecb29d269300583d37234fd7efc1c9.jpg)  
Figure 7-31.  Fuel selector valve.  

# Fuel Strainers, Sumps, and Drains  

After leaving the fuel tank and before it enters the carburetor,  the fuel passes through a strainer that removes any moisture  and other sediments in the system. Since these contaminants  are heavier than aviation fuel, they settle in a sump at the  bottom of the strainer assembly. A sump is a low point in a fuel  system and/or fuel tank. The fuel system may contain a sump,  a fuel strainer, and fuel tank drains, which may be collocated.  

The fuel strainer should be drained before each flight. Fuel  samples should be drained and checked visually for water  and contaminants.  

Water in the sump is hazardous because in cold weather the  water can freeze and block fuel lines. In warm weather, it  can flow into the carburetor and stop the engine. If water is  present in the sump, more water in the fuel tanks is probable,  and they should be drained until there is no evidence of water.  Never take off until all water and contaminants have been  removed from the engine fuel system.  

Because of the variation in fuel systems, become thoroughly  familiar with the systems that apply to the aircraft being flown.  Consult the AFM/POH for specific operating procedures.  

# Fuel Grades  

Aviation gasoline (AVGAS) is identified by an octane or  performance number (grade), which designates the antiknock  value or knock resistance of the fuel mixture in the engine  cylinder. The higher the grade of gasoline, the more pressure  the fuel can withstand without detonating. Lower grades of  fuel are used in lower-compression engines because these  fuels ignite at a lower temperature. Higher grades are used  in higher-compression engines because they ignite at higher  temperatures, but not prematurely. If the proper grade of fuel  is not available, use the next higher grade as a substitute. Never  use a grade lower than recommended. This can cause the  cylinder head temperature and engine oil temperature to exceed  their normal operating ranges, which may result in detonation.  

Several grades of AVGAS are available. Care must be  exercised to ensure that the correct aviation grade is being  used for the specific type of engine. The proper fuel grade is  stated in the AFM/POH, on placards in the flight deck, and  next to the filler caps. Automobile gas should NEVER be  used in aircraft engines unless the aircraft has been modified  with a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) issued by the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  

The current method identifies AVGAS for aircraft with  reciprocating engines by the octane and performance number,  along with the abbreviation AVGAS. These aircraft use  AVGAS 80, 100, and 100LL. Although AVGAS 100LL  performs the same as grade 100, the “LL” indicates it has  a low lead content. Fuel for aircraft with turbine engines is  classified as JET A, JET A-1, and JET B. Jet fuel is basically  kerosene and has a distinctive kerosene smell. Since use of  the correct fuel is critical, dyes are added to help identify the  type and grade of fuel.  [Figure 7-32]  

In addition to the color of the fuel itself, the color-coding  system extends to decals and various airport fuel handling  equipment. For example, all AVGAS is identified by name,  using white letters on a red background. In contrast, turbine  fuels are identified by white letters on a black background.  

Special Airworthiness Information Bulleting (SAIB)  NE‑11‑15 advises that grade 100VLL AVGAS is acceptable  for use on aircraft and engines. 100VLL meets all  performance requirements of grades 80, 91, 100, and 100LL;  meets the approved operating limitations for aircraft and  engines certificated to operate with these other grades of  AVGAS; and is basically identical to 100LL AVGAS. The  lead content of 100VLL is reduced by about 19 percent.  100VLL is blue like 100LL and virtually indistinguishable.  

# Fuel Contamination  

Accidents attributed to powerplant failure from fuel  contamination have often been traced to:  

•	 Inadequate preflight inspection by the pilot •	 Servicing aircraft with improperly filtered fuel from  small tanks or drums •	 Storing aircraft with partially filled fuel tanks •	 Lack of proper maintenance  

Fuel should be drained from the fuel strainer quick drain and  from each fuel tank sump into a transparent container and  then checked for dirt and water. When the fuel strainer is  being drained, water in the tank may not appear until all the  fuel has been drained from the lines leading to the tank. This  indicates that water remains in the tank and is not forcing the  fuel out of the fuel lines leading to the fuel strainer. Therefore,  drain enough fuel from the fuel strainer to be certain that  fuel is being drained from the tank. The amount depends on  

![](images/f45fbf125c1dbd20f8a4eb4421133fc67d22f9921dc7aea581af20304e060ae0.jpg)  
Figure 7-32.  Aviation fuel color-coding system.  

the length of fuel line from the tank to the drain. If water or  other contaminants are found in the first sample, drain further  samples until no trace appears.  

Water may also remain in the fuel tanks after the drainage  from the fuel strainer has ceased to show any trace of water.  This residual water can be removed only by draining the fuel  tank sump drains.  

Water is the principal fuel contaminant. Suspended water  droplets in the fuel can be identified by a cloudy appearance  of the fuel, or by the clear separation of water from the colored  fuel, which occurs after the water has settled to the bottom  of the tank. As a safety measure, the fuel sumps should be  drained before every flight during the preflight inspection.  

Fuel tanks should be filled after each flight or after the last  flight of the day to prevent moisture condensation within the  tank. To prevent fuel contamination, avoid refueling from  cans and drums.  

In remote areas or in emergency situations, there may be no  alternative to refueling from sources with inadequate anti- contamination systems. While a chamois skin and funnel  may be the only possible means of filtering fuel, using  them is hazardous. Remember, the use of a chamois does  not always ensure decontaminated fuel. Worn-out chamois  do not filter water; neither will a new, clean chamois that is  already water-wet or damp. Most imitation chamois skins  do not filter water.  

# Fuel System Icing  

Ice formation in the aircraft fuel system results from the  presence of water in the fuel system. This water may be  undissolved or dissolved. One condition of undissolved  water is entrained water that consists of minute water  particles suspended in the fuel. This may occur as a result of  mechanical agitation of free water or conversion of dissolved  water through temperature reduction. Entrained water settles  out in time under static conditions and may or may not be  drained during normal servicing, depending on the rate at  which it is converted to free water. In general, it is not likely  that all entrained water can ever be separated from fuel under  field conditions. The settling rate depends on a series of  factors including temperature, quiescence, and droplet size.  

The droplet size varies depending upon the mechanics  of formation. Usually, the particles are so small as to be  invisible to the naked eye, but in extreme cases, can cause  slight haziness in the fuel. Water in solution cannot be  removed except by dehydration or by converting it through  temperature reduction to entrained, then to free water.  

Another condition of undissolved water is free water that  may be introduced as a result of refueling or the settling of  entrained water that collects at the bottom of a fuel tank. Free  water is usually present in easily detected quantities at the  bottom of the tank, separated by a continuous interface from  the fuel above. Free water can be drained from a fuel tank  through the sump drains, which are provided for that purpose.  Free water, frozen on the bottom of reservoirs, such as the  fuel tanks and fuel filter, may render water drains useless  and can later melt releasing the water into the system thereby  causing engine malfunction or stoppage. If such a condition  is detected, the aircraft may be placed in a warm hangar to  reestablish proper draining of these reservoirs, and all sumps  and drains should be activated and checked prior to flight.  

Entrained water (i.e., water in solution with petroleum fuels)  constitutes a relatively small part of the total potential water  in a particular system, the quantity dissolved being dependent  on fuel temperature and the existing pressure and the water  volubility characteristics of the fuel. Entrained water freezes  in mid fuel and tends to stay in suspension longer since the  specific gravity of ice is approximately the same as that of  AVGAS.  

Water in suspension may freeze and form ice crystals of  sufficient size such that fuel screens, strainers, and filters  may be blocked. Some of this water may be cooled further as  the fuel enters carburetor air passages and causes carburetor  metering component icing, when conditions are not otherwise  conducive to this form of icing.  

# Prevention Procedures  

The use of anti-icing additives for some aircraft has been  approved as a means of preventing problems with water  and ice in AVGAS. Some laboratory and flight testing  indicates that the use of hexylene glycol, certain methanol  derivatives, and ethylene glycol mononethyl ether (EGME)  in small concentrations inhibit fuel system icing. These tests  indicate that the use of EGME at a maximum 0.15 percent  by volume concentration substantially inhibits fuel system  icing under most operating conditions. The concentration  of additives in the fuel is critical. Marked deterioration in  additive effectiveness may result from too little or too much  additive. Pilots should recognize that anti-icing additives are  in no way a substitute or replacement for carburetor heat.  Aircraft operating instructions involving the use of carburetor  heat should be adhered to at all times when operating under  atmospheric conditions conducive to icing.  

# Refueling Procedures  

Static electricity is formed by the friction of air passing  over the surfaces of an aircraft in flight and by the flow of  fuel through the hose and nozzle during refueling. Nylon,  Dacron, or wool clothing is especially prone to accumulate  and discharge static electricity from the person to the funnel  or nozzle. To guard against the possibility of static electricity  igniting fuel fumes, a ground wire should be attached to the  aircraft before the fuel cap is removed from the tank. Because  both the aircraft and refueler have different static charges,  bonding both components to each other is critical. By bonding  both components to each other, the static differential charge is  equalized. The refueling nozzle should be bonded to the aircraft  before refueling begins and should remain bonded throughout  the refueling process. When a fuel truck is used, it should be  grounded prior to the fuel nozzle contacting the aircraft.  

If fueling from drums or cans is necessary, proper bonding  and grounding connections are important. Drums should be  placed near grounding posts, and the following sequence of  connections observed:  

1. 	 Drum to ground 2. 	 Ground to aircraft 3. 	 Drum to aircraft or nozzle to aircraft before removing  the fuel cap  

When disconnecting, reverse the order.  

The passage of fuel through a chamois increases the charge  of static electricity and the danger of sparks. The aircraft  must be properly grounded and the nozzle, chamois filter,  and funnel bonded to the aircraft. If a can is used, it should  be connected to either the grounding post or the funnel.  Under no circumstances should a plastic bucket or similar  nonconductive container be used in this operation.  

# Heating System  

There are many different types of aircraft heating systems that  are available depending on the type of aircraft. Regardless of  which type or the safety features that accompany them, it is  always important to reference the specific aircraft operator’s  manual and become knowledgeable about the heating system.  Each has different repair and inspection criteria that should  be precisely followed.  

# Fuel Fired Heaters  

A fuel fired heater is a small mounted or portable space- heating device. The fuel is brought to the heater by using  piping from a fuel tank, or taps into the aircraft’s fuel system.  A fan blows air into a combustion chamber, and a spark plug  or ignition device lights the fuel-air mixture. A built-in safety  switch prevents fuel from flowing unless the fan is working.  Outside the combustion chamber, a second, larger diameter  tube conducts air around the combustion tube’s outer surface,  and a second fan blows the warmed air into tubing to direct  it towards the interior of the aircraft. Most gasoline heaters  can produce between 5,000 and 50,000 British Thermal Units  (BTU) per hour.  

Fuel fired heaters require electricity to operate and are  compatible with a 12-volt and 24-volt aircraft electrical  system. The heater requires routine maintenance, such as  regular inspection of the combustion tube and replacement of  the igniter at periodic intervals. Because gasoline heaters are  required to be vented, special care must be made to ensure the  vents do not leak into the interior of the aircraft. Combustion  byproducts include soot, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and  some carbon monoxide. An improperly adjusted, fueled, or  poorly maintained fuel heater can be dangerous.  

# Exhaust Heating Systems  

Exhaust heating systems are the simplest type of aircraft  heating system and are used on most light aircraft. Exhaust  heating systems are used to route exhaust gases away from  the engine and fuselage while reducing engine noise. The  exhaust systems also serve as a heat source for the cabin  and carburetor.  

The risks of operating an aircraft with a defective exhaust  heating system include carbon monoxide poisoning, a  decrease in engine performance, and an increased potential  for fire. Because of these risks, technicians should be aware  of the rate of exhaust heating system deterioration and should  thoroughly inspect all areas of the exhaust heating system to  look for deficiencies inside and out.  

# Combustion Heater Systems  

Combustion heaters or surface combustion heaters are often  used to heat the cabin of larger, more expensive aircraft.  This type of heater burns the aircraft’s fuel in a combustion  chamber or tube to develop required heat, and the air  flowing around the tube is heated and ducted to the cabin.  A combustion heater is an airtight burner chamber with a  stainless-steel jacket. Fuel from the aircraft fuel system is  ignited and burns to provide heat. Ventilation air is forced  over the airtight burn chamber picking up heat, which is then  dispersed into the cabin area.  

When the heater control switch is turned on, airflow, ignition,  and fuel are supplied to the heater. Airflow and ignition are  constant within the burner chamber while the heater control  switch is on. When heat is required, the temperature control  is advanced, activating the thermostat. The thermostat (which  senses ventilation air temperature) turns on the fuel solenoid  allowing fuel to spray into the burner chamber. Fuel mixes  with air inside the chamber and is ignited by the spark plug,  producing heat.  

The by-product, carbon monoxide, leaves the aircraft through  the heater exhaust pipe. Air flowing over the outside of the  burner chamber and inside the jacket of the heater absorbs  the heat and carries it through ducts into the cabin. As the  thermostat reaches its preset temperature, it turns off the fuel  solenoid and stops the flow of fuel into the burner chamber.  When ventilation air cools to the point that the thermostat  again turns the fuel solenoid on, the burner starts again.  

This method of heat is very safe as an overheat switch is  provided on all combustion heaters, which is wired into  the heater’s electrical system to shut off the fuel in the case  of malfunction. In the unlikely event that the heater fuel  solenoid, located at the heater, remains open or the control  switches fail, the remote fuel solenoid and/or fuel pump is  shut off by the mechanical overheat switch, stopping all fuel  flow to the system.  

As opposed to the fuel fired cabin heaters that are used  on most single-engine aircraft, it is unlikely for carbon  monoxide poisoning to occur in combustion heaters.  Combustion heaters have low pressure in the combustion  tube that is vented through its exhaust into the air stream. The  ventilation air on the outside of the combustion chamber is  of higher pressure than on the inside, and ram air increases  the pressure on the outside of the combustion tube. In the  event a leak would develop in the combustion chamber, the  higher-pressure air outside the chamber would travel into the  chamber and out the exhaust.  

# Bleed Air Heating Systems  

Bleed air heating systems are used on turbine-engine  aircraft. Extremely hot compressor bleed air is ducted into  a chamber where it is mixed with ambient or re-circulated  air to cool the air to a useable temperature. The air mixture  is then ducted into the cabin. This type of system contains  several safety features to include temperature sensors that  prevent excessive heat from entering the cabin, check  valves to prevent a loss of compressor bleed air when  starting the engine and when full power is required, and  engine sensors to eliminate the bleed system if the engine  becomes inoperative.  

# Electrical System  

Most aircraft are equipped with either a 14- or a 28-volt direct  current (DC) electrical system. A basic aircraft electrical  system consists of the following components:  

•	 Alternator/generator  

•	 Battery •	 Master/battery switch •	 Alternator/generator switch •	 Bus bar, fuses, and circuit breakers •	 Voltage regulator •	 Ammeter/loadmeter •	 Associated electrical wiring  

Engine-driven alternators or generators supply electric  current to the electrical system. They also maintain a  sufficient electrical charge in the battery. Electrical energy  stored in a battery provides a source of electrical power for  starting the engine and a limited supply of electrical power  for use in the event the alternator or generator fails.  

Most DC generators do not produce a sufficient amount of  electrical current at low engine rpm to operate the entire  electrical system. During operations at low engine rpm, the  electrical needs must be drawn from the battery, which can  quickly be depleted.  

Alternators have several advantages over generators.  Alternators produce sufficient current to operate the entire  electrical system, even at slower engine speeds, by producing  alternating current (AC), which is converted to DC. The  electrical output of an alternator is more constant throughout  a wide range of engine speeds.  

Some aircraft have receptacles to which an external ground  power unit (GPU) may be connected to provide electrical  energy for starting. These are very useful, especially  during cold weather starting. Follow the manufacturer’s  recommendations for engine starting using a GPU.  

The electrical system is turned on or off with a master switch.  Turning the master switch to the ON position provides  electrical energy to all the electrical equipment circuits  except the ignition system. Equipment that commonly uses  the electrical system for its source of energy includes:  

•	 Position lights •	 Anticollision lights •	 Landing lights •	 Taxi lights •	 Interior cabin lights •	 Instrument lights •	 Radio equipment •	 Turn indicator •	 Fuel gauges  

•	 Electric fuel pump •	 Stall warning system •	 Pitot heat •	 Starting motor  

Many aircraft are equipped with a battery switch that  controls the electrical power to the aircraft in a manner  similar to the master switch. In addition, an alternator switch  is installed that permits the pilot to exclude the alternator  from the electrical system in the event of alternator failure.  [Figure 7-33]  

With the alternator half of the switch in the OFF position, the  entire electrical load is placed on the battery. All nonessential  electrical equipment should be turned off to conserve  battery power.  

A bus bar is used as a terminal in the aircraft electrical system  to connect the main electrical system to the equipment using  electricity as a source of power. This simplifies the wiring  system and provides a common point from which voltage can  be distributed throughout the system.  [Figure 7-34]  

Fuses or circuit breakers are used in the electrical system to  protect the circuits and equipment from electrical overload.  Spare fuses of the proper amperage limit should be carried in  the aircraft to replace defective or blown fuses. Circuit breakers  have the same function as a fuse but can be manually reset,  rather than replaced, if an overload condition occurs in the  electrical system. Placards at the fuse or circuit breaker panel  identify the circuit by name and show the amperage limit.  

![](images/27a4ec9338e3e2a02cca964d616738b2cd6a4e05135eb6f64ec2736a5e984755.jpg)  
Figure 7-33.  On this master switch, the left half is for the alternator  and the right half is for the battery.  

An ammeter is used to monitor the performance of the aircraft  electrical system. The ammeter shows if the alternator/ generator is producing an adequate supply of electrical power.  It also indicates whether or not the battery is receiving an  electrical charge.  

Ammeters are designed with the zero point in the center  of the face and a negative or positive indication on either  side.  [Figure 7-35]  When the pointer of the ammeter is  on the plus side, it shows the charging rate of the battery.  A minus indication means more current is being drawn  from the battery than is being replaced. A full-scale minus  deflection indicates a malfunction of the alternator/generator.  A full-scale positive deflection indicates a malfunction of  the regulator. In either case, consult the AFM/POH for  appropriate action to be taken.  

Not all aircraft are equipped with an ammeter. Some have  a warning light that, when lighted, indicates a discharge in  the system as a generator/alternator malfunction. Refer to the  AFM/POH for appropriate action to be taken.  

Another electrical monitoring indicator is a loadmeter.  This type of gauge has a scale beginning with zero and  shows the load being placed on the alternator/generator.  [Figure 7-35]  The loadmeter reflects the total percentage of  the load placed on the generating capacity of the electrical  system by the electrical accessories and battery. When all  electrical components are turned off, it reflects only the  amount of charging current demanded by the battery.  

A voltage regulator controls the rate of charge to the battery  by stabilizing the generator or alternator electrical output. The  generator/alternator voltage output should be higher than the  battery voltage. For example, a 12-volt battery would be fed  by a generator/alternator system of approximately 14 volts.  The difference in voltage keeps the battery charged.  

# Hydraulic Systems  

There are multiple applications for hydraulic use in aircraft,  depending on the complexity of the aircraft. For example, a  hydraulic system is often used on small airplanes to operate  wheel brakes, retractable landing gear, and some constant- speed propellers. On large airplanes, a hydraulic system is  used for flight control surfaces, wing flaps, spoilers, and  other systems.  

A basic hydraulic system consists of a reservoir, pump  (either hand, electric, or engine-driven), a filter to keep the  fluid clean, a selector valve to control the direction of flow,  a relief valve to relieve excess pressure, and an actuator.  [Figure 7-36]  

![](images/08c1d6dc66f9cad65bcadad8b10d94983d46992c6a06441f1f861056e6d67b4a.jpg)  
Figure 7-34.  Electrical system schematic.  

The hydraulic fluid is pumped through the system to an  actuator or servo. A servo is a cylinder with a piston inside  that turns fluid power into work and creates the power needed  to move an aircraft system or flight control. Servos can be  either single-acting or double-acting, based on the needs of  the system. This means that the fluid can be applied to one  or both sides of the servo, depending on the servo type. A  single-acting servo provides power in one direction. The  selector valve allows the fluid direction to be controlled.  This is necessary for operations such as the extension and  retraction of landing gear during which the fluid must work  in two different directions. The relief valve provides an outlet

Figure 7-35.  Ammeter and loadmeter.  

for the system in the event of excessive fluid pressure in the  system. Each system incorporates different components to  meet the individual needs of different aircraft.  

A mineral-based hydraulic fluid is the most widely used type  for small aircraft. This type of hydraulic fluid, a kerosene-like  petroleum product, has good lubricating properties, as well  as additives to inhibit foaming and prevent the formation  of corrosion. It is chemically stable, has very little viscosity  change with temperature, and is dyed for identification. Since  several types of hydraulic fluids are commonly used, an aircraft  must be serviced with the type specified by the manufacturer.  Refer to the AFM/POH or the Maintenance Manual.  

# Landing Gear  

The landing gear forms the principal support of an aircraft on  the surface. The most common type of landing gear consists  of wheels, but aircraft can also be equipped with floats for  water operations or skis for landing on snow.  [Figure 7-37] The landing gear on small aircraft consists of three wheels:  two main wheels (one located on each side of the fuselage)  and a third wheel positioned either at the front or rear of the  

![](images/dda7580221d756bec7ee16a6189a0fd410e57fdc1101af86732f7cb28e3d7f44.jpg)

Figure 7-37.  The landing gear supports the airplane during the  takeoff run, landing, taxiing, and when parked.  

airplane. Landing gear employing a rear-mounted wheel is  called conventional landing gear. Airplanes with conventional  landing gear are often referred to as tailwheel airplanes. When  the third wheel is located on the nose, it is called a nosewheel,  and the design is referred to as a tricycle gear. A steerable  nosewheel or tailwheel permits the airplane to be controlled  throughout all operations while on the ground.  

# Tricycle Landing Gear  

There are three advantages to using tricycle landing gear:  

1. 	 It allows more forceful application of the brakes during  landings at high speeds without causing the aircraft to  nose over. 2. 	 It permits better forward visibility for the pilot during  takeoff, landing, and taxiing. 3. 	 It tends to prevent ground looping (swerving) by  providing more directional stability during ground  operation since the aircraft’s center of gravity (CG)  is forward of the main wheels. The forward CG keeps  the airplane moving forward in a straight line rather  than ground looping.  

Nosewheels are either steerable or castering. Steerable  nosewheels are linked to the rudders by cables or rods, while  castering nosewheels are free to swivel. In both cases, the  aircraft is steered using the rudder pedals. Airplanes with a  castering nosewheel may require the pilot to combine the  use of the rudder pedals with independent use of the brakes.  

# Tailwheel Landing Gear  

Tailwheel landing gear airplanes have two main wheels  attached to the airframe ahead of its CG that support most of  the weight of the structure. A tailwheel at the very back of the  fuselage provides a third point of support. This arrangement  

maintenance. Retractable landing gear is designed to  streamline the airplane by allowing the landing gear to  be stowed inside the structure during cruising flight.  [Figure 7-39]  

allows adequate ground clearance for a larger propeller  and is more desirable for operations on unimproved fields.  [Figure 7-38]  

With the CG located behind the main landing gear, directional  control using this type of landing gear is more difficult while  on the ground. This is the main disadvantage of the tailwheel  landing gear. For example, if the pilot allows the aircraft to  swerve while rolling on the ground at a low speed, he or  she may not have sufficient rudder control and the CG will  attempt to get ahead of the main gear, which may cause the  airplane to ground loop.  

# Brakes  

Airplane brakes are located on the main wheels and are  applied by either a hand control or by foot pedals (toe or heel).  Foot pedals operate independently and allow for differential  braking. During ground operations, differential braking can  supplement nosewheel/tailwheel steering.  

# Pressurized Aircraft  

Diminished forward visibility when the tailwheel is on or near  the ground is a second disadvantage of tailwheel landing gear  airplanes. Because of these disadvantages, specific training  is required to operate tailwheel airplanes.  

Aircraft are flown at high altitudes for two reasons. First, an  aircraft flown at high altitude consumes less fuel for a given  airspeed than it does for the same speed at a lower altitude  because the aircraft is more efficient at a high altitude.  Second, bad weather and turbulence may be avoided by flying  in relatively smooth air above the storms. Many modern  aircraft are being designed to operate at high altitudes,  taking advantage of that environment. In order to fly at  higher altitudes, the aircraft must be pressurized or suitable  supplemental oxygen must be provided for each occupant.  It is important for pilots who fly these aircraft to be familiar  with the basic operating principles.  

# Fixed and Retractable Landing Gear  

Landing gear can also be classified as either fixed or  retractable. Fixed landing gear always remains extended  and has the advantage of simplicity combined with low  

![](images/ef02e75351ffa69cc731dab798b022bd2a41a434a9fd9596c3be6fa058a2fd9c.jpg)  
Figure 7-38.  Tailwheel landing gear.  

In a typical pressurization system, the cabin, flight  compartment, and baggage compartments are incorporated  into a sealed unit capable of containing air under a pressure  higher than outside atmospheric pressure. On aircraft powered  by turbine engines, bleed air from the engine compressor  section is used to pressurize the cabin. Superchargers may  be used on older model turbine-powered aircraft to pump  air into the sealed fuselage. Piston-powered aircraft may use  air supplied from each engine turbocharger through a sonic  venturi (flow limiter). Air is released from the fuselage by  

![](images/328418003cb97e9b991c5924be777de61fed344c4dc932ab0a82b06815d38ef6.jpg)

a device called an outflow valve. By regulating the air exit,  the outflow valve allows for a constant inflow of air to the  pressurized area.  [Figure 7-40]  

A cabin pressurization system typically maintains a cabin  pressure altitude of approximately 8,000 feet at the maximum  designed cruising altitude of an aircraft. This prevents rapid  changes of cabin altitude that may be uncomfortable or cause  injury to passengers and crew. In addition, the pressurization  system permits a reasonably fast exchange of air from  the inside to the outside of the cabin. This is necessary to  eliminate odors and to remove stale air.  [Figure 7-41]  

Pressurization of the aircraft cabin is necessary in order to  protect occupants against hypoxia. Within a pressurized  cabin, occupants can be transported comfortably and safely  for long periods of time, particularly if the cabin altitude  is maintained at 8,000 feet or below, where the use of  oxygen equipment is not required. The flight crew in this  type of aircraft must be aware of the danger of accidental  loss of cabin pressure and be prepared to deal with such an  emergency whenever it occurs.

Figure 7-41.  Standard atmospheric pressure chart.  

The following terms will aid in understanding the operating  principles of pressurization and air conditioning systems:  

•	 Aircraft altitude—the actual height above sea level at  which the aircraft is flying •	 Ambient temperature—the temperature in the area  immediately surrounding the aircraft •	 Ambient pressure—the pressure in the area  immediately surrounding the aircraft •	 Cabin altitude—cabin pressure in terms of equivalent  altitude above sea level •	 Differential pressure—the difference in pressure  between the pressure acting on one side of a wall  and the pressure acting on the other side of the  wall. In aircraft air-conditioning and pressurizing  systems, it is the difference between cabin pressure  and atmospheric pressure.  

The cabin pressure control system provides cabin pressure  regulation, pressure relief, vacuum relief, and the means  for selecting the desired cabin altitude in the isobaric and  differential range. In addition, dumping of the cabin pressure  is a function of the pressure control system. A cabin pressure  regulator, an outflow valve, and a safety valve are used to  accomplish these functions.  

The cabin pressure regulator controls cabin pressure to a  selected value in the isobaric range and limits cabin pressure  to a preset differential value in the differential range. When an  aircraft reaches the altitude at which the difference between  the pressure inside and outside the cabin is equal to the  highest differential pressure for which the fuselage structure  is designed, a further increase in aircraft altitude will result  in a corresponding increase in cabin altitude. Differential  control is used to prevent the maximum differential pressure,  for which the fuselage was designed, from being exceeded.  This differential pressure is determined by the structural  strength of the cabin and often by the relationship of the  cabin size to the probable areas of rupture, such as window  areas and doors.  

The cabin air pressure safety valve is a combination  pressure relief, vacuum relief, and dump valve. The pressure  relief valve prevents cabin pressure from exceeding a  predetermined differential pressure above ambient pressure.  The vacuum relief prevents ambient pressure from exceeding  cabin pressure by allowing external air to enter the cabin  when ambient pressure exceeds cabin pressure. The flight  deck control switch actuates the dump valve. When this  switch is positioned to ram, a solenoid valve opens, causing  the valve to dump cabin air into the atmosphere.  

The degree of pressurization and the operating altitude of  the aircraft are limited by several critical design factors.  Primarily, the fuselage is designed to withstand a particular  maximum cabin differential pressure.  

Several instruments are used in conjunction with the  pressurization controller. The cabin differential pressure gauge  indicates the difference between inside and outside pressure.  This gauge should be monitored to assure that the cabin does  not exceed the maximum allowable differential pressure. A  cabin altimeter is also provided as a check on the performance  of the system. In some cases, these two instruments are  combined into one. A third instrument indicates the cabin rate  of climb or descent. A cabin rate-of-climb instrument and a  cabin altimeter are illustrated in  Figure 7-42.  

Decompression is defined as the inability of the aircraft’s  pressurization system to maintain its designed pressure  differential. This can be caused by a malfunction in the  pressurization system or structural damage to the aircraft.  

Physiologically, decompressions fall into the following two  categories:  

•	 Explosive decompression—a change in cabin pressure  faster than the lungs can decompress, possibly  resulting in lung damage. Normally, the time required  to release air from the lungs without restrictions, such  as masks, is 0.2 seconds. Most authorities consider any  decompression that occurs in less than 0.5 seconds to  be explosive and potentially dangerous. •	 Rapid decompression—a change in cabin pressure in  which the lungs decompress faster than the cabin.  

During an explosive decompression, there may be noise,  and one may feel dazed for a moment. The cabin air fills  with fog, dust, or flying debris. Fog occurs due to the rapid  drop in temperature and the change of relative humidity.  Normally, the ears clear automatically. Air rushes from the  mouth and nose due to the escape of air from the lungs and  may be noticed by some individuals.  

Rapid decompression decreases the period of useful  consciousness because oxygen in the lungs is exhaled rapidly,  reducing pressure on the body. This decreases the partial  pressure of oxygen in the blood and reduces the pilot’s  effective performance time by one-third to one-fourth its  normal time. For this reason, an oxygen mask should be  worn when flying at very high altitudes (35,000 feet or  higher). It is recommended that the crewmembers select the  100 percent oxygen setting on the oxygen regulator at high  altitude if the aircraft is equipped with a demand or pressure  demand oxygen system.  

![](images/b73e92997a5b7bc41de90ee98c3f1d56769ea35ccdf7fe2da6ffd1a95f5ab956.jpg)  
Figure 7-42.  Cabin pressurization instruments.  

The primary danger of decompression is hypoxia. Quick,  proper utilization of oxygen equipment is necessary to avoid  unconsciousness. Another potential danger that pilots, crew,  and passengers face during high altitude decompressions is  evolved gas decompression sickness. This occurs when the  pressure on the body drops sufficiently, nitrogen comes out  of solution, and forms bubbles inside the person that can have  adverse effects on some body tissues.  

Decompression caused by structural damage to the aircraft  presents another type of danger to pilots, crew, and  passengers––being tossed or blown out of the aircraft if  they are located near openings. Individuals near openings  should wear safety harnesses or seatbelts at all times when  the aircraft is pressurized and they are seated. Structural  damage also has the potential to expose them to wind blasts  and extremely cold temperatures.  

Rapid descent from altitude is necessary in order to minimize  these problems. Automatic visual and aural warning systems  are included in the equipment of all pressurized aircraft.  

# Oxygen Systems  

Crew and passengers use oxygen systems, in conjunction  with pressurization systems, to prevent hypoxia. Regulations  require, at a minimum, flight crews have and use supplemental  oxygen after 30 minutes exposure to cabin pressure altitudes  between 12,500 and 14,000 feet. Use of supplemental  oxygen is required immediately upon exposure to cabin  pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet. Every aircraft occupant,  above 15,000 feet cabin pressure altitude, must have  supplemental oxygen. However, based on a person’s physical  characteristics and condition, a person may feel the effects  of oxygen deprivation at much lower altitudes. Some people  flying above 10,000 feet during the day may experience  disorientation due to the lack of adequate oxygen. At night,  especially when fatigued, these effects may occur as low  as 5,000 feet. Therefore, for optimum protection, pilots are  encouraged to use supplemental oxygen above 10,000 feet  cabin altitude during the day and above 5,000 feet at night.  

Most high altitude aircraft come equipped with some type  of fixed oxygen installation. If the aircraft does not have  a fixed installation, portable oxygen equipment must be  readily accessible during flight. The portable equipment  usually consists of a container, regulator, mask outlet,  and pressure gauge. Aircraft oxygen is usually stored in  high pressure system containers of 1,800–2,200 psi. When  the ambient temperature surrounding an oxygen cylinder  decreases, pressure within that cylinder decreases because  pressure varies directly with temperature if the volume of a  gas remains constant. A drop in the indicated pressure of a  supplemental oxygen cylinder may be due to the container  being stored in an unheated area of the aircraft rather than  an actual depletion of the oxygen supply. High pressure  oxygen containers should be marked with the psi tolerance  (i.e., 1,800 psi) before filling the container to that pressure.  The containers should be supplied with oxygen that meets  or exceeds SAE AS8010 (as revised), Aviator’s Breathing  Oxygen Purity Standard. To assure safety, periodic inspection  and servicing of the oxygen system should be performed.  

An oxygen system consists of a mask or cannula and a  regulator that supplies a flow of oxygen dependent upon  cabin altitude. Most regulators approved for use up to 40,000  feet are designed to provide zero percent cylinder oxygen  and 100 percent cabin air at cabin altitudes of 8,000 feet or  less, with the ratio changing to 100 percent oxygen and zero  percent cabin air at approximately 34,000 feet cabin altitude.  [Figure 7-43]  Most regulators approved up to 45,000 feet  are designed to provide 40 percent cylinder oxygen and 60  percent cabin air at lower altitudes, with the ratio changing  to 100 percent at the higher altitude.  

Pilots should be aware of the danger of fire when using  oxygen. Materials that are nearly fireproof in ordinary air may  be susceptible to combustion in oxygen. Oils and greases may  ignite if exposed to oxygen and cannot be used for sealing  the valves and fittings of oxygen equipment. Smoking during  any kind of oxygen equipment use is prohibited. Before  each flight, the pilot should thoroughly inspect and test all  oxygen equipment. The inspection should include a thorough  examination of the aircraft oxygen equipment, including  available supply, an operational check of the system, and  assurance that the supplemental oxygen is readily accessible.  The inspection should be accomplished with clean hands and  should include a visual inspection of the mask and tubing  for tears, cracks, or deterioration; the regulator for valve  and lever condition and positions; oxygen quantity; and the  location and functioning of oxygen pressure gauges, flow  indicators, and connections. The mask should be donned and  the system should be tested. After any oxygen use, verify that  all components and valves are shut off.

Figure 7-43.  Oxygen system regulator.  

# Oxygen Masks  

There are numerous types and designs of oxygen masks in  use. The most important factor in oxygen mask use is to  ensure that the masks and oxygen system are compatible.  Crew masks are fitted to the user’s face with a minimum of  leakage and usually contain a microphone. Most masks are  the oronasal type that covers only the mouth and nose.  

A passenger mask may be a simple, cup-shaped rubber  molding sufficiently flexible to obviate individual fitting. It  may have a simple elastic head strap or the passenger may  hold it to his or her face.  

All oxygen masks should be kept clean to reduce the danger  of infection and prolong the life of the mask. To clean the  mask, wash it with a mild soap and water solution and rinse  it with clear water. If a microphone is installed, use a clean  swab, instead of running water, to wipe off the soapy solution.  The mask should also be disinfected. A gauze pad that has  been soaked in a water solution of Merthiolate can be used  to swab out the mask. This solution used should contain  one-fifth teaspoon of Merthiolate per quart of water. Wipe  the mask with a clean cloth and air dry.  

# Cannula  

A cannula is an ergonomic piece of plastic tubing that runs  under the nose to administer oxygen to the user.  [Figure 7-44] Cannulas are typically more comfortable than masks, but  may not provide an adequate flow of oxygen as reliably as  masks when operating at higher altitudes. Airplanes certified  to older regulations had cannulas installed with an on-board  

![](images/ab5863e696a5880e4e9474b31d6bcc499492176f0979737a19706c32e8b2d34e.jpg)  
Figure 7-44.  Cannula with green flow detector.  

oxygen system. However, current regulations require aircraft  with oxygen systems installed and certified for operations  above 18,000 feet to be equipped with oxygen masks instead  of cannulas. Many cannulas have a flow meter in the oxygen  supply line. If equipped, a periodic check of the green flow  detector should be a part of the pilot’s regular scan.  

# Diluter-Demand Oxygen Systems  

Diluter-demand oxygen systems supply oxygen only when  the user inhales through the mask. An automix lever allows  the regulators to automatically mix cabin air and oxygen or  supply 100 percent oxygen, depending on the altitude. The  demand mask provides a tight seal over the face to prevent  dilution with outside air and can be used safely up to 40,000  feet. A pilot who has a beard or mustache should be sure it is  trimmed in a manner that will not interfere with the sealing  of the oxygen mask. The fit of the mask around the beard or  mustache should be checked on the ground for proper sealing.  

# Pressure-Demand Oxygen Systems  

Pressure-demand oxygen systems are similar to diluter  demand oxygen equipment, except that oxygen is supplied to  the mask under pressure at cabin altitudes above 34,000 feet.  Pressure-demand regulators create airtight and oxygen-tight  seals, but they also provide a positive pressure application of  oxygen to the mask face piece that allows the user’s lungs  to be pressurized with oxygen. This feature makes pressure  demand regulators safe at altitudes above 40,000 feet. Some  systems may have a pressure demand mask with the regulator  attached directly to the mask, rather than mounted on the  instrument panel or other area within the flight deck. The  mask-mounted regulator eliminates the problem of a long  hose that must be purged of air before 100 percent oxygen  begins flowing into the mask.  

# Continuous-Flow Oxygen System  

Continuous-flow oxygen systems are usually provided for  passengers. The passenger mask typically has a reservoir  bag that collects oxygen from the continuous-flow oxygen  system during the time when the mask user is exhaling.  The oxygen collected in the reservoir bag allows a higher  aspiratory flow rate during the inhalation cycle, which  reduces the amount of air dilution. Ambient air is added to  the supplied oxygen during inhalation after the reservoir bag  oxygen supply is depleted. The exhaled air is released to the  cabin.  [Figure 7-45]  

# Electrical Pulse-Demand Oxygen System  

Portable electrical pulse-demand oxygen systems deliver  oxygen by detecting an individual’s inhalation effort and  provide oxygen flow during the initial portion of inhalation.  Pulse demand systems do not waste oxygen during the

breathing cycle because oxygen is only delivered during  inhalation. Compared to continuous-flow systems, the pulse- demand method of oxygen delivery can reduce the amount  of oxygen needed by 50–85 percent. Most pulse-demand  oxygen systems also incorporate an internal barometer  that automatically compensates for changes in altitude by  increasing the amount of oxygen delivered for each pulse as  altitude is increased.  [Figure 7-46]  

# Pulse Oximeters  

A pulse oximeter is a device that measures the amount of  oxygen in an individual’s blood, in addition to heart rate.  This non-invasive device measures the color changes that  red blood cells undergo when they become saturated with  oxygen. By transmitting a special light beam through a  fingertip to evaluate the color of the red cells, a pulse  oximeter can calculate the degree of oxygen saturation  within one percent of directly measured blood oxygen.  Because of their portability and speed, pulse oximeters are  very useful for pilots operating in nonpressurized aircraft  above 12,500 feet where supplemental oxygen is required.  A pulse oximeter permits crewmembers and passengers of  an aircraft to evaluate their actual need for supplemental  oxygen.  [Figure 7-47]  

# Servicing of Oxygen Systems  

Before servicing any aircraft with oxygen, consult the  specific aircraft service manual to determine the type of  equipment required and procedures to be used. Certain  precautions should be observed whenever aircraft oxygen

systems are to be serviced. Oxygen system servicing should  be accomplished only when the aircraft is located outside  of the hangars. Personal cleanliness and good housekeeping  are imperative when working with oxygen. Oxygen under  pressure creates spontaneous results when brought in contact  with petroleum products. Service people should be certain to  wash dirt, oil, and grease (including lip salves and hair oil)  from their hands before working around oxygen equipment. It  is also essential that clothing and tools are free of oil, grease,  

![](images/e574aa521c488705efdaf5d09e9890d09171679931a650d555b39b58b040746a.jpg)

and dirt. Aircraft with permanently installed oxygen tanks  usually require two persons to accomplish servicing of the  system. One should be stationed at the service equipment  control valves, and the other stationed where he or she  can observe the aircraft system pressure gauges. Oxygen  system servicing is not recommended during aircraft fueling  operations or while other work is performed that could  provide a source of ignition. Oxygen system servicing while  passengers are on board the aircraft is not recommended.  

# Anti-Ice and Deice Systems  

Anti-icing equipment is designed to prevent the formation  of ice, while deicing equipment is designed to remove ice  once it has formed. These systems protect the leading edge  of wing and tail surfaces, pitot and static port openings, fuel  tank vents, stall warning devices, windshields, and propeller  blades. Ice detection lighting may also be installed on some  aircraft to determine the extent of structural icing during  night flights.  

Most light aircraft have only a heated pitot tube and are not  certified for flight in icing. These light aircraft have limited  cross-country capability in the cooler climates during late  fall, winter, and early spring. Noncertificated aircraft must  exit icing conditions immediately. Refer to the AFM/POH  for details.  

# Airfoil Anti-Ice and Deice  

Inflatable deicing boots consist of a rubber sheet bonded to  the leading edge of the airfoil. When ice builds up on the  leading edge, an engine-driven pneumatic pump inflates the  rubber boots. Many turboprop aircraft divert engine bleed  air to the wing to inflate the rubber boots. Upon inflation,  the ice is cracked and should fall off the leading edge of the  wing. Deicing boots are controlled from the flight deck by  a switch and can be operated in a single cycle or allowed to  cycle at automatic, timed intervals.  [Figure 7-48]  

In the past, it was believed that if the boots were cycled  too soon after encountering ice, the ice layer would expand  instead of breaking off, resulting in a condition referred to as  ice “bridging.” Consequently, subsequent deice boot cycles  would be ineffective at removing the ice buildup. Although  some residual ice may remain after a boot cycle, “bridging”  does not occur with any modern boots. Pilots can cycle the  boots as soon as an ice accumulation is observed. Consult  the AFM/POH for information on the operation of deice  boots on an aircraft.  

Many deicing boot systems use the instrument system suction  gauge and a pneumatic pressure gauge to indicate proper boot  operation. These gauges have range markings that indicate  the operating limits for boot operation. Some systems may

Figure 6-48.  Deicing boots on the leading edge of the wing.  

also incorporate an annunciator light to indicate proper boot  operation.  

Proper maintenance and care of deicing boots are important  for continued operation of this system. They need to be  carefully inspected during preflight.  

Another type of leading edge protection is the thermal anti-ice  system. Heat provides one of the most effective methods for  preventing ice accumulation on an airfoil. High performance  turbine aircraft often direct hot air from the compressor  section of the engine to the leading edge surfaces. The hot  air heats the leading edge surfaces sufficiently to prevent the  formation of ice. A newer type of thermal anti-ice system  referred to as ThermaWing uses electrically heated graphite  foil laminate applied to the leading edge of the wing and  horizontal stabilizer. ThermaWing systems typically have  two zones of heat application. One zone on the leading edge  receives continuous heat; the second zone further aft receives  heat in cycles to dislodge the ice allowing aerodynamic forces  to remove it. Thermal anti-ice systems should be activated  prior to entering icing conditions.  

An alternate type of leading edge protection that is not as  common as thermal anti-ice and deicing boots is known  as a weeping wing. The weeping-wing design uses small  holes located in the leading edge of the wing to prevent  the formation and build-up of ice. An antifreeze solution  is pumped to the leading edge and weeps out through the  holes. Additionally, the weeping wing is capable of deicing  an aircraft. When ice has accumulated on the leading edges,  application of the antifreeze solution chemically breaks down  the bond between the ice and airframe, allowing aerodynamic  forces to remove the ice.  [Figure 7-49]  

# Windscreen Anti-Ice  

There are two main types of windscreen anti-ice systems.  The first system directs a flow of alcohol to the windscreen.  If used early enough, the alcohol prevents ice from building  up on the windscreen. The rate of alcohol flow can be  controlled by a dial in the flight deck according to procedures  recommended by the aircraft manufacturer.  

Another effective method of anti-icing equipment is the  electric heating method. Small wires or other conductive  material is imbedded in the windscreen. The heater can be  turned on by a switch in the flight deck, causing an electrical  current to be passed across the shield through the wires to  provide sufficient heat to prevent the formation of ice on  the windscreen. The heated windscreen should only be used  during flight. Do not leave it on during ground operations, as  it can overheat and cause damage to the windscreen. Warning:  the electrical current can cause compass deviation errors by  as much as  $40^{\circ}$  .  

# Propeller Anti-Ice  

Propellers are protected from icing by the use of alcohol or  electrically heated elements. Some propellers are equipped  with a discharge nozzle that is pointed toward the root of the  blade. Alcohol is discharged from the nozzles, and centrifugal  force drives the alcohol down the leading edge of the blade.  The boots are also grooved to help direct the flow of alcohol.  This prevents ice from forming on the leading edge of the  propeller. Propellers can also be fitted with propeller anti-ice  boots. The propeller boot is divided into two sections—the  

![](images/25187701e8c9a2724e61c36935f337b8fa4c0a0d71960b774860929ab8752226.jpg)  
Figure 7-49.  TKS weeping wing anti-ice/deicing system.  

inboard and the outboard sections. The boots are imbedded  with electrical wires that carry current for heating the  propeller. The prop anti-ice system can be monitored for  proper operation by monitoring the prop anti-ice ammeter.  During the preflight inspection, check the propeller boots for  proper operation. If a boot fails to heat one blade, an unequal  blade loading can result and may cause severe propeller  vibration.  [Figure 7-50]  

# Other Anti-Ice and Deice Systems  

Pitot and static ports, fuel vents, stall-warning sensors,  and other optional equipment may be heated by electrical  elements. Operational checks of the electrically heated  systems are to be checked in accordance with the AFM /POH.  

Operation of aircraft anti-icing and deicing systems should be  checked prior to encountering icing conditions. Encounters  with structural ice require immediate action. Anti-icing and  deicing equipment are not intended to sustain long-term flight  in icing conditions.  

# Chapter Summary  

All aircraft have a requirement for essential systems such  as the engine, propeller, induction, ignition systems as well  as the fuel, lubrication, cooling, electrical, landing gear, and

environmental control systems to support flight. Understanding  the aircraft systems of the aircraft being flown is critical to  its safe operation and proper maintenance. Consult the AFM/ POH for specific information pertaining to the aircraft being  flown. Various manufacturer and owners group websites can  also be a valuable source of additional information.  

# Flight   Instruments  

# Introduction  

In order to safely fly any aircraft, a pilot must understand  how to interpret and operate the flight instruments. The  pilot also needs to be able to recognize associated errors and  malfunctions of these instruments. This chapter addresses the  pitot-static system and associated instruments, the vacuum  system and related instruments, gyroscopic instruments, and  the magnetic compass. When a pilot understands how each  instrument works and recognizes when an instrument is  malfunctioning, he or she can safely utilize the instruments  to their fullest potential.  

# Pitot-Static Flight Instruments  

The pitot-static system is a combined system that utilizes the  static air pressure and the dynamic pressure due to the motion  of the aircraft through the air. These combined pressures are  utilized for the operation of the airspeed indicator (ASI),  altimeter, and vertical speed indicator (VSI).  [Figure 8-1]  

![](images/9c65e558707d96471500fdc7cf571e2065856d3996196a204fc3bb9be408d46d.jpg)

Figure 8-1.   Pitot-static system and instruments.  

# Impact Pressure Chamber and Lines  

The pitot tube is utilized to measure the total combined  pressures that are present when an aircraft moves through  the air. Static pressure, also known as ambient pressure, is  always present whether an aircraft is moving or at rest. It is  simply the barometric pressure in the local area. Dynamic  pressure is present only when an aircraft is in motion;  therefore, it can be thought of as a pressure due to motion.  Wind also generates dynamic pressure. It does not matter if  the aircraft is moving through still air at 70 knots or if the  aircraft is facing a wind with a speed of 70 knots, the same  dynamic pressure is generated.  

When the wind blows from an angle less than   $90°$   off the  nose of the aircraft, dynamic pressure can be depicted on the  ASI. The wind moving across the airfoil at 20 knots is the  same as the aircraft moving through calm air at 20 knots.  The pitot tube captures the dynamic pressure, as well as the  static pressure that is always present.  

The pitot tube has a small opening at the front that allows  the total pressure to enter the pressure chamber. The total  pressure is made up of dynamic pressure plus static pressure.  In addition to the larger hole in the front of the pitot tube,  there is a small hole in the back of the chamber that allows  moisture to drain from the system should the aircraft enter  precipitation. Both openings in the pitot tube must be checked  prior to flight to ensure that neither is blocked. Many aircraft  have pitot tube covers installed when they sit for extended  periods of time. This helps to keep bugs and other objects  from becoming lodged in the opening of the pitot tube.  

The one instrument that utilizes the pitot tube is the ASI. The  total pressure is transmitted to the ASI from the pitot tube’s  pressure chamber via a small tube. The static pressure is  also delivered to the opposite side of the ASI, which serves  to cancel out the two static pressures, thereby leaving the  dynamic pressure to be indicated on the instrument. When  the dynamic pressure changes, the ASI shows either increase  or decrease, corresponding to the direction of change. The  two remaining instruments (altimeter and VSI) utilize only  the static pressure that is derived from the static port.  

# Static Pressure Chamber and Lines  

The static chamber is vented through small holes to the  free undisturbed air on the side(s) of the aircraft. As the  atmospheric pressure changes, the pressure is able to move  freely in and out of the instruments through the small lines  that connect the instruments to the static system. An alternate  static source is provided in some aircraft to provide static  pressure should the primary static source become blocked.  The alternate static source is normally found inside the flight  deck. Due to the venturi effect of the air flowing around the  fuselage, the air pressure inside the flight deck is lower than  the exterior pressure.  

When the alternate static source pressure is used, the  following instrument indications are observed:  

1. 	 The altimeter indicates a slightly higher altitude than  actual. 2. 	 The ASI indicates an airspeed greater than the actual  airspeed. 3. 	 The VSI shows a momentary climb and then stabilizes  if the altitude is held constant.  

Each pilot is responsible for consulting the Aircraft Flight  Manual (AFM) or the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)  to determine the amount of error that is introduced into the  system when utilizing the alternate static source. In an aircraft  not equipped with an alternate static source, an alternate  method of introducing static pressure into the system should  a blockage occur is to break the glass face of the VSI. This  most likely renders the VSI inoperative. The reason for  choosing the VSI as the instrument to break is that it is the  least important static source instrument for flight.  

# Altimeter  

The altimeter is an instrument that measures the height of  an aircraft above a given pressure level. Pressure levels  are discussed later in detail. Since the altimeter is the only  instrument that is capable of indicating altitude, this is one of  the most vital instruments installed in the aircraft. To use the  altimeter effectively, the pilot must understand the operation  of the instrument, as well as the errors associated with the  altimeter and how each affect the indication.  

A stack of sealed aneroid wafers comprise the main  component of the altimeter. An aneroid wafer is a sealed  wafer that is evacuated to an internal pressure of 29.92  inches of mercury   $({}^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$  . These wafers are free to expand  and contract with changes to the static pressure. A higher  static pressure presses down on the wafers and causes them  to collapse. A lower static pressure (less than   $29.92\ \mathrm{"Hg})$    allows the wafers to expand. A mechanical linkage connects  the wafer movement to the needles on the indicator face,  which translates compression of the wafers into a decrease  in altitude and translates an expansion of the wafers into an  increase in altitude.  [Figure 8-2]  

Notice how the static pressure is introduced into the rear of the  sealed altimeter case. The altimeter’s outer chamber is sealed,  which allows the static pressure to surround the aneroid  wafers. If the static pressure is higher than the pressure in the  aneroid wafers   $(29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg})$  , then the wafers are compressed  

![](images/94d508edbb1376c9b4b1b6fc34f17fe377f5753f417fe8a6581a1695167be1c0.jpg)  
Figure 8-2.   Altimeter.  

until the pressure inside the wafers is equal to the surrounding  static pressure. Conversely, if the static pressure is less than  the pressure inside of the wafers, the wafers are able to expand  which increases the volume. The expansion and contraction  of the wafers moves the mechanical linkage which drives the  needles on the face of the altimeter.  

# Principle of Operation  

The pressure altimeter is an aneroid barometer that measures  the pressure of the atmosphere at the level where the altimeter is  located and presents an altitude indication in feet. The altimeter  uses static pressure as its source of operation. Air is denser  at sea level than aloft—as altitude increases, atmospheric  pressure decreases. This difference in pressure at various levels  causes the altimeter to indicate changes in altitude.  

The presentation of altitude varies considerably between  different types of altimeters. Some have one pointer while  others have two or more. Only the multipointer type is  discussed in this handbook. The dial of a typical altimeter  is graduated with numerals arranged clockwise from zero  to nine. Movement of the aneroid element is transmitted  through gears to the three hands that indicate altitude. In  Figure 8-2 , the long, thin needle with the inverted triangle  at the end indicates tens of thousands of feet; the short, wide  needle indicates thousands of feet; and the long needle on  top indicates hundreds of feet.  

This indicated altitude is correct, however, only when the  sea level barometric pressure is standard  $(29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg})$  ), the sea  level free air temperature is standard (  $+15$   degrees Celsius   $(^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$   or 59 degrees Fahrenheit   $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ), and the pressure and  temperature decrease at a standard rate with an increase  in altitude. Adjustments for nonstandard pressures are  accomplished by setting the corrected pressure into a  barometric scale located on the face of the altimeter. The  barometric pressure window is sometimes referred to as  the Kollsman window; only after the altimeter is set does it  indicate the correct altitude. The word “correct” will need  to be better explained when referring to types of altitudes,  but is commonly used in this case to denote the approximate  altitude above sea level. In other words, the indicated  altitude refers to the altitude read off of the altitude which is  uncorrected, after the barometric pressure setting is dialed  into the Kollsman window. The additional types of altitudes  are further explained later.  

# Effect of Nonstandard Pressure and Temperature  

It is easy to maintain a consistent height above ground if  the barometric pressure and temperature remain constant,  but this is rarely the case. The pressure and temperature can  change between takeoff and landing even on a local flight.  If these changes are not taken into consideration, flight  becomes dangerous.  

If altimeters could not be adjusted for nonstandard pressure, a  hazardous situation could occur. For example, if an aircraft is  flown from a high pressure area to a low pressure area without  adjusting the altimeter, a constant altitude will be displayed,  but the actual height of the aircraft above the ground would  be lower then the indicated altitude. There is an old aviation  axiom: “GOING FROM A HIGH TO A LOW, LOOK OUT  BELOW.” Conversely, if an aircraft is flown from a low  pressure area to a high pressure area without an adjustment  of the altimeter, the actual altitude of the aircraft is higher  than the indicated altitude. Once in flight, it is important to  frequently obtain current altimeter settings en route to ensure  terrain and obstruction clearance.  

Many altimeters do not have an accurate means of being  adjusted for barometric pressures in excess of 31.00   $"\mathrm{Hg}$  . When the altimeter cannot be set to the higher  pressure setting, the aircraft actual altitude is higher than  the altimeter indicates. When low barometric pressure  conditions occur (below 28.00), flight operations by  aircraft unable to set the actual altimeter setting are  not recommended.  

Adjustments to compensate for nonstandard pressure do  not compensate for nonstandard temperature. Since cold  air is denser than warm air, when operating in temperatures  that are colder than standard, the altitude is lower than the  altimeter indication.  [Figure 8-3]  It is the magnitude of this  “difference” that determines the magnitude of the error. It is  the difference due to colder temperatures that concerns the  pilot. When flying into a cooler air mass while maintaining a  constant indicated altitude, true altitude is lower. If terrain or  obstacle clearance is a factor in selecting a cruising altitude,  particularly in mountainous terrain, remember to anticipate  that a colder-than-standard temperature places the aircraft  lower than the altimeter indicates. Therefore, a higher  indicated altitude may be required to provide adequate terrain  clearance. A variation of the memory aid used for pressure

Figure 8-3.   Effects of nonstandard temperature on an altimeter.  

can be employed: “FROM HOT TO COLD, LOOK OUT  BELOW.” When the air is warmer than standard, the aircraft  is higher than the altimeter indicates. Altitude corrections for  temperature can be computed on the navigation computer.  

Extremely cold temperatures also affect altimeter indications.  Figure 8-4,  which was derived from ICAO formulas,  indicates how much error can exist when the temperature is  extremely cold.  

# Setting the Altimeter  

Most altimeters are equipped with a barometric pressure  setting window (or Kollsman window) providing a means  to adjust the altimeter. A knob is located at the bottom of the  instrument for this adjustment.  

To adjust the altimeter for variation in atmospheric pressure,  the pressure scale in the altimeter setting window, calibrated  in inches of mercury   $({}^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   and/or millibars (mb), is adjusted  to match the given altimeter setting. Altimeter setting is  defined as station pressure reduced to sea level, but an  altimeter setting is accurate only in the vicinity of the  reporting station. Therefore, the altimeter must be adjusted as  the flight progresses from one station to the next. Air traffic  control (ATC) will advise when updated altimeter settings  are available. If a pilot is not utilizing ATC assistance,  local altimeter settings can be obtained by monitoring local  automated weather observing system/automated surface  observation system (AWOS/ASOS) or automatic terminal  information service (ATIS) broadcasts.  

Many pilots confidently expect the current altimeter setting  will compensate for irregularities in atmospheric pressure at  all altitudes, but this is not always true. The altimeter setting  broadcast by ground stations is the station pressure corrected  to mean sea level. It does not account for the irregularities  

![](images/2e4ab39acc9007b5c1434fa5ea845116c3152e514dd2980d0d7cb1aae4cbf9da.jpg)  

at higher levels, particularly the effect of nonstandard  temperature. If each pilot in a given area is using the same  altimeter setting, each altimeter should be equally affected  by temperature and pressure variation errors, making it  possible to maintain the desired vertical separation between  aircraft. This does not guarantee vertical separation though.  It is still imperative to maintain a regimented visual scan for  intruding air traffic.  

When flying over high, mountainous terrain, certain  atmospheric conditions cause the altimeter to indicate an  altitude of 1,000 feet or more higher than the actual altitude.  For this reason, a generous margin of altitude should be  allowed—not only for possible altimeter error, but also for  possible downdrafts that might be associated with high winds.  

To illustrate the use of the altimeter setting system, follow a  flight from Dallas Love Field, Texas, to Abilene Municipal  Airport, Texas, via Mineral Wells. Before taking off from  Love Field, the pilot receives a current altimeter setting of   $29.85~"\mathrm{Hg}$   from the control tower or ATIS and sets this value  in the altimeter setting window. The altimeter indication  should then be compared with the known airport elevation of  487 feet. Since most altimeters are not perfectly calibrated,  an error may exist.  

When over Mineral Wells, assume the pilot receives a current  altimeter setting of   $29.94~"\mathrm{Hg}$   and sets this in the altimeter  window. Before entering the traffic pattern at Abilene  Municipal Airport, a new altimeter setting of   $29.69~"\mathrm{Hg}$  is received from the Abilene Control Tower and set in  the altimeter setting window. If the pilot desires to fly the  traffic pattern at approximately 800 feet above the terrain,  and the field elevation of Abilene is 1,791 feet, an indicated  altitude of 2,600 feet should be maintained (1,791 feet   $^+$  800 feet  $=2{,}591$   feet, rounded to 2,600 feet).  

The importance of properly setting the altimeter cannot  be overemphasized. Assume the pilot did not adjust the  altimeter at Abilene to the current setting and continued using  the Mineral Wells setting of   $29.94~"\mathrm{Hg}$  . When entering the  Abilene traffic pattern at an indicated altitude of 2,600 feet,  the aircraft would be approximately 250 feet below the proper  traffic pattern altitude. Upon landing, the altimeter would  indicate approximately 250 feet higher than the field elevation.  

Mineral Wells altimeter setting 	 29.94 Abilene altimeter setting 	 	 29.69 Difference 	 	 	   0.25  

(Since 1 inch of pressure is equal to approximately 1,000 feet  of altitude,  $0.25\times1\small{,}000$   feet  $=250$   feet.)  

When determining whether to add or subtract the amount of  altimeter error, remember that when the actual pressure is lower  than what is set in the altimeter window, the actual altitude  of the aircraft is lower than what is indicated on the altimeter.  

The following is another method of computing the altitude  deviation. Start by subtracting the current altimeter setting  from  $29.94\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Always remember to place the original setting  as the top number. Then subtract the current altimeter setting.  

Mineral Wells altimeter setting 	 29.94 Abilene altimeter setting 	 	 29.69  $29.94-29.69=$   Difference 	 	   0.25  

(Since 1 inch of pressure is equal to approximately 1,000 feet  of altitude,   $0.25\,\times\,1\small{,}000$   feet  $=250$   feet.) Always subtract  the number from the indicated altitude.  

$$
2{,}600-250=2{,}350
$$  

Now, try a lower pressure setting. Adjust from altimeter  setting 29.94 to  $30.56\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .  

Mineral Wells altimeter setting 	 29.94 Altimeter setting 	 	 	 30.56  $29.94-30.56=\mathrm{Diffvphantom}$  29.94 – 30.56 = Difference 	 	 –0.62  

(Since 1 inch of pressure is equal to approximately 1,000 feet  of altitude,   $0.62\,\times\,1\small{,}000$   feet  $=620$   feet.) Always subtract  the number from the indicated altitude.  

$$
2{,}600-(-620)=3{,}220
$$  

The pilot will be 620 feet high.  

Notice the difference is a negative number. Starting with the  current indicated altitude of 2,600 feet, subtracting a negative  number is the same as adding the two numbers. By utilizing  this method, a pilot will better understand the importance of  using the current altimeter setting (miscalculation of where  and in what direction an error lies can affect safety; if altitude  is lower than indicated altitude, an aircraft could be in danger  of colliding with an obstacle).  

# Altimeter Operation  

There are two means by which the altimeter pointers can  be moved. The first is a change in air pressure, while the  other is an adjustment to the barometric scale. When the  aircraft climbs or descends, changing pressure within the  altimeter case expands or contracts the aneroid barometer.  This movement is transmitted through mechanical linkage  to rotate the pointers.  

A decrease in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate an  increase in altitude, and an increase in pressure causes the  altimeter to indicate a decrease in altitude. Accordingly, if  the aircraft is sitting on the ground with a pressure level of   $29.98~"\mathrm{Hg}$   and the pressure level changes to   $29.68~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , the  altimeter would show an increase of approximately 300 feet  in altitude. This pressure change is most noticeable when the  aircraft is left parked over night. As the pressure falls, the  altimeter interprets this as a climb. The altimeter indicates  an altitude above the actual field elevation. If the barometric  pressure setting is reset to the current altimeter setting of 29.68   $"\mathrm{Hg}$  , then the field elevation is again indicated on the altimeter.  

This pressure change is not as easily noticed in flight since  aircraft fly at specific altitudes. The aircraft steadily decreases  true altitude while the altimeter is held constant through pilot  action as discussed in the previous section.  

Knowing the aircraft’s altitude is vitally important to a  pilot. The pilot must be sure that the aircraft is flying high  enough to clear the highest terrain or obstruction along the  intended route. It is especially important to have accurate  altitude information when visibility is restricted. To clear  obstructions, the pilot must constantly be aware of the altitude  of the aircraft and the elevation of the surrounding terrain. To  reduce the possibility of a midair collision, it is essential to  maintain altitude in accordance with air traffic rules.  

# Types of Altitude  

Altitude in itself is a relevant term only when it is specifically  stated to which type of altitude a pilot is referring. Normally  when the term “altitude” is used, it is referring to altitude  above sea level since this is the altitude which is used to  depict obstacles and airspace, as well as to separate air traffic.  

Altitude is vertical distance above some point or level used as  a reference. There are as many kinds of altitude as there are  reference levels from which altitude is measured, and each  may be used for specific reasons. Pilots are mainly concerned  with five types of altitudes:  

1. 	 Indicated altitude—read directly from the altimeter  (uncorrected) when it is set to the current altimeter  setting.  

2. 	 True altitude—the vertical distance of the aircraft  above sea level—the actual altitude. It is often  expressed as feet above mean sea level (MSL). Airport,  terrain, and obstacle elevations on aeronautical charts  are true altitudes.  

3. 	 Absolute altitude—the vertical distance of an aircraft  above the terrain, or above ground level (AGL).  

4. 	 Pressure altitude—the altitude indicated when  the altimeter setting window (barometric scale) is  adjusted to   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  . This is the altitude above  the standard datum plane, which is a theoretical  plane where air pressure (corrected to   $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ) equals   $29.92\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Pressure altitude is used to compute density  altitude, true altitude, true airspeed (TAS), and other  performance data.  

5. 	 Density altitude—pressure altitude corrected  for variations from standard temperature. When  conditions are standard, pressure altitude and density  altitude are the same. If the temperature is above  standard, the density altitude is higher than pressure  altitude. If the temperature is below standard, the  density altitude is lower than pressure altitude. This  is an important altitude because it is directly related  to the aircraft’s performance.  

A pilot must understand how the performance of the aircraft  is directly related to the density of the air. The density of  the air affects how much power a naturally aspirated engine  produces, as well as how efficient the airfoils are. If there are  fewer air molecules (lower pressure) to accelerate through  the propeller, the acceleration to rotation speed is longer  and thus produces a longer takeoff roll, which translates to  a decrease in performance.  

As an example, consider an airport with a field elevation  of 5,048 feet MSL where the standard temperature is   $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  Under these conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude  are the same—5,048 feet. If the temperature changes to   $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , the density altitude increases to 7,855 feet. This  means an aircraft would perform on takeoff as though the  field elevation were 7,855 feet at standard temperature.  Conversely, a temperature of  $-25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   would result in a density  altitude of 1,232 feet. An aircraft would perform much better  under these conditions.  

# Instrument Check  

Prior to each flight, a pilot should examine the altimeter for  proper indications in order to verify its validity. To determine  the condition of an altimeter, set the barometric scale to the  current reported altimeter setting transmitted by the local  airport traffic control tower, flight service station (FSS), or  any other reliable source, such as ATIS, AWOS, or ASOS.  The altimeter pointers should indicate the surveyed field  elevation of the airport. If the indication is off more than  75 feet from the surveyed field elevation, the instrument  should be referred to a certificated instrument repair station  for recalibration.  

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

The VSI, which is sometimes called a vertical velocity  indicator (VVI), indicates whether the aircraft is climbing,  descending, or in level flight. The rate of climb or descent is  indicated in feet per minute (fpm). If properly calibrated, the  VSI indicates zero in level flight.  [Figure 8-5]  

# Principle of Operation  

Although the VSI operates solely from static pressure, it is a  differential pressure instrument. It contains a diaphragm with  connecting linkage and gearing to the indicator pointer inside  an airtight case. The inside of the diaphragm is connected  directly to the static line of the pitot-static system. The area  outside the diaphragm, which is inside the instrument case,  is also connected to the static line but through a restricted  orifice (calibrated leak).  

Both the diaphragm and the case receive air from the static  line at existing atmospheric pressure. The diaphragm receives  unrestricted air, while the case receives the static pressure via  the metered leak. When the aircraft is on the ground or in level  flight, the pressures inside the diaphragm and the instrument  case are equal, and the pointer is at the zero indication.  When the aircraft climbs or descends, the pressure inside  the diaphragm changes immediately, but due to the metering  action of the restricted passage, the case pressure remains  higher or lower for a short time, causing the diaphragm to  contract or expand. This causes a pressure differential that  is indicated on the instrument needle as a climb or descent.  When the pressure differential stabilizes at a definite ratio,  the needle indicates the rate of altitude change.  

![](images/f0d1c5d6e1fcca6ea7249e0c6de696f648dca395ef55bc60bd5f42e108784cb7.jpg)  
Figure 8-5.   Vertical speed indicator (VSI).  

The VSI displays two different types of information:  

• 	 Trend information shows an immediate indication of  an increase or decrease in the aircraft’s rate of climb  or descent. • 	 Rate information shows a stabilized rate of change in  altitude.  

The trend information is the direction of movement of the  VSI needle. For example, if an aircraft is maintaining level  flight and the pilot pulls back on the control yoke causing the  nose of the aircraft to pitch up, the VSI needle moves upward  to indicate a climb. If the pitch attitude is held constant,  the needle stabilizes after a short period (6–9 seconds) and  indicates the rate of climb in hundreds of fpm. The time  period from the initial change in the rate of climb, until the  VSI displays an accurate indication of the new rate, is called  the lag. Rough control technique and turbulence can extend  the lag period and cause erratic and unstable rate indications.  Some aircraft are equipped with an instantaneous vertical  speed indicator (IVSI), which incorporates accelerometers  to compensate for the lag in the typical VSI.  [Figure 8-6]  

# Instrument Check  

As part of a preflight check, proper operation of the VSI  must be established. Make sure the VSI indicates a near zero  reading prior to leaving the ramp area and again just before  takeoff. If the VSI indicates anything other than zero, that  indication can be referenced as the zero mark. Normally, if the  needle is not exactly zero, it is only slightly above or below  the zero line. After takeoff, the VSI should trend upward to  indicate a positive rate of climb and then, once a stabilized  climb is established, a rate of climb can be referenced.

Figure 8-6.   An IVSI incorporates accelerometers to help the  instrument immediately indicate changes in vertical speed.  

# Airspeed Indicator (ASI)  

The ASI is a sensitive, differential pressure gauge that  measures and promptly indicates the difference between pitot  (impact/dynamic pressure) and static pressure. These two  pressures are equal when the aircraft is parked on the ground  in calm air. When the aircraft moves through the air, the  pressure on the pitot line becomes greater than the pressure  in the static lines. This difference in pressure is registered by  the airspeed pointer on the face of the instrument, which is  calibrated in miles per hour, knots (nautical miles per hour),  or both.  [Figure 8-7]  

The ASI is the one instrument that utilizes both the pitot,  as well as the static system. The ASI introduces the static  pressure into the airspeed case while the pitot pressure  (dynamic) is introduced into the diaphragm. The dynamic  pressure expands or contracts one side of the diaphragm,  which is attached to an indicating system. The system drives  the mechanical linkage and the airspeed needle.  

Just as in altitudes, there are multiple types of airspeeds.  Pilots need to be very familiar with each type.  

• 	 Indicated airspeed (IAS)—the direct instrument  reading obtained from the ASI, uncorrected for  variations in atmospheric density, installation error,  or instrument error. Manufacturers use this airspeed  as the basis for determining aircraft performance.  Takeoff, landing, and stall speeds listed in the AFM/  POH are IAS and do not normally vary with altitude  or temperature.  

![](images/da0b9ee326bd4f7f2bebcd96f4e8bfe69a891a963b903cbb336b9bc73f512e54.jpg)  
Figure 8-7.   Airspeed indicator (ASI).  

• 	 Calibrated airspeed (CAS)—IAS corrected for  installation error and instrument error. Although  manufacturers attempt to keep airspeed errors to a  minimum, it is not possible to eliminate all errors  throughout the airspeed operating range. At certain  airspeeds and with certain flap settings, the installation  and instrument errors may total several knots. This  error is generally greatest at low airspeeds. In the  cruising and higher airspeed ranges, IAS and CAS  are approximately the same. Refer to the airspeed  calibration chart to correct for possible airspeed errors.  

• 	 True airspeed (TAS)—CAS corrected for altitude  and nonstandard temperature. Because air density  decreases with an increase in altitude, an aircraft has  to be flown faster at higher altitudes to cause the same  pressure difference between pitot impact pressure  and static pressure. Therefore, for a given CAS, TAS  increases as altitude increases; or for a given TAS,  CAS decreases as altitude increases. A pilot can find  TAS by two methods. The most accurate method is  to use a flight computer. With this method, the CAS  is corrected for temperature and pressure variation by  using the airspeed correction scale on the computer.  Extremely accurate electronic flight computers are  also available. Just enter the CAS, pressure altitude,  and temperature, and the computer calculates the TAS.  A second method, which is a rule of thumb, provides  the approximate TAS. Simply add 2 percent to the  CAS for each 1,000 feet of altitude. The TAS is the  speed that is used for flight planning and is used when  filing a flight plan. • 	 Groundspeed (GS)—the actual speed of the airplane  over the ground. It is TAS adjusted for wind. GS  decreases with a headwind and increases with a  

# Airspeed Indicator Markings  

Aircraft weighing 12,500 pounds or less, manufactured after  1945, and certificated by the FAA are required to have ASIs  marked in accordance with a standard color-coded marking  system. This system of color-coded markings enables a pilot  to determine at a glance certain airspeed limitations that are  important to the safe operation of the aircraft. For example, if  during the execution of a maneuver, it is noted that the airspeed  needle is in the yellow arc and rapidly approaching the red  line, the immediate reaction should be to reduce airspeed.  

As shown in  Figure 8-8,  ASIs on single-engine small aircraft  include the following standard color-coded markings:  

• 	 White arc—commonly referred to as the flap operating  range since its lower limit represents the full flap stall  speed and its upper limit provides the maximum flap  

![](images/5b684dbc14824b47fa58e7821b444af9dbc9fa0c3e4d38a8fd18ff86d1754352.jpg)  
Figure 8-8.   Single engine airspeed indicator (ASI).  

speed. Approaches and landings are usually flown at  speeds within the white arc. • 	 Lower limit of white arc   $({\bf V}_{S0})$  —the stalling speed  or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing  configuration. In small aircraft, this is the power-off  stall speed at the maximum landing weight in the  landing configuration (gear and flaps down). • 	 Upper limit of the white arc   $(\mathrm{V_{FE}})$  —the maximum  speed with the flaps extended. • 	 Green arc—the normal operating range of the aircraft.  Most flying occurs within this range. • 	 Lower limit of green arc   $(\mathbf{V}_{S1})$  —the stalling speed  or the minimum steady flight speed obtained in a  specified configuration. For most aircraft, this is the  power-off stall speed at the maximum takeoff weight  in the clean configuration (gear up, if retractable, and  flaps up). • 	 Upper limit of green arc   $\mathrm{(V_{N0})}$  —the maximum  structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed  except in smooth air. • 	 Yellow arc—caution range. Fly within this range only  in smooth air and then only with caution. • 	 Red line   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  —never exceed speed. Operating above  this speed is prohibited since it may result in damage  or structural failure.  

# Other Airspeed Limitations  

Some important airspeed limitations are not marked on the  face of the ASI, but are found on placards and in the AFM/ POH. These airspeeds include:  

• 	 Design maneuvering speed   $(\mathrm{V_{A})}$  —the maximum  speed at which the structural design’s limit load can  be imposed (either by gusts or full deflection of the  control surfaces) without causing structural damage.  It is important to consider weight when referencing  this speed. For example,   $\mathrm{V_{A}}$   may be 100 knots when  an airplane is heavily loaded, but only 90 knots when  the load is light. • 	 Landing gear operating speed   $\left({\bf V}_{\mathrm{LO}}\right)$  —the maximum  speed for extending or retracting the landing gear if  flying an aircraft with retractable landing gear. • 	 Landing gear extended speed   $(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{LE}})$  —the maximum  speed at which an aircraft can be safely flown with  the landing gear extended. • 	 Best angle-of-climb speed   $\left(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$  —the airspeed at  which an aircraft gains the greatest amount of altitude  in a given distance. It is used during a short-field  takeoff to clear an obstacle. • 	 Best rate-of-climb speed   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  —the airspeed that  provides the most altitude gain in a given period of time. • 	 Single-engine best rate-of-climb   $(\mathrm{V_{YSE}})$  —the best  rate-of-climb or minimum rate-of-sink in a light  twin-engine aircraft with one engine inoperative. It is  marked on the ASI with a blue line.  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{YSE}}$   is commonly  referred to as “Blue Line.” • 	 Minimum control speed   $\mathrm{(V_{MC})}$  —the minimum flight  speed at which a light, twin-engine aircraft can be  satisfactorily controlled when an engine suddenly  becomes inoperative and the remaining engine is at  takeoff power.  

# Instrument Check  

Prior to takeoff, the ASI should read zero. However, if there  is a strong wind blowing directly into the pitot tube, the ASI  may read higher than zero. When beginning the takeoff,  make sure the airspeed is increasing at an appropriate rate.  

# Blockage of the Pitot-Static System  

Errors almost always indicate blockage of the pitot tube, the  static port(s), or both. Blockage may be caused by moisture  (including ice), dirt, or even insects. During preflight, make  sure the pitot tube cover is removed. Then, check the pitot and  static port openings. A blocked pitot tube affects the accuracy  of the ASI, but a blockage of the static port not only affects  the ASI, but also causes errors in the altimeter and VSI.  

# Blocked Pitot System  

The pitot system can become blocked completely or only  partially if the pitot tube drain hole remains open. If the pitot  tube becomes blocked and its associated drain hole remains  clear, ram air is no longer able to enter the pitot system. Air  already in the system vents through the drain hole, and the  remaining pressure drops to ambient (outside) air pressure.  Under these circumstances, the ASI reading decreases to  zero because the ASI senses no difference between ram and  static air pressure. The ASI no longer operates since dynamic  pressure cannot enter the pitot tube opening. Static pressure  is able to equalize on both sides since the pitot drain hole  is still open. The apparent loss of airspeed is not usually  instantaneous but happens very quickly.  [Figure 8-9]  

If both the pitot tube opening and the drain hole should  become clogged simultaneously, then the pressure in the pitot  tube is trapped. No change is noted on the airspeed indication  should the airspeed increase or decrease. If the static port  is unblocked and the aircraft should change altitude, then a  change is noted on the ASI. The change is not related to a  change in airspeed but a change in static pressure. The total  pressure in the pitot tube does not change due to the blockage;  however, the static pressure will change.  

Because airspeed indications rely upon both static and  dynamic pressure together, the blockage of either of these  systems affects the ASI reading. Remember that the ASI has  a diaphragm in which dynamic air pressure is entered. Behind  this diaphragm is a reference pressure called static pressure  that comes from the static ports. The diaphragm pressurizes  against this static pressure and as a result changes the airspeed  indication via levers and indicators.  [Figure 8-10]  

For example, take an aircraft and slow it down to zero knots  at a given altitude. If the static port (providing static pressure)  and the pitot tube (providing dynamic pressure) are both  unobstructed, the following claims can be made:  

1. 	 The ASI would be zero. 2. 	 Dynamic pressure and static pressure are equal. 3. 	 Because both dynamic and static air pressure are equal  at zero speed with increased speed, dynamic pressure  

![](images/7c0f7e5284ec0339832d37b3312a5d271ba4a23652b43cc99a9f04ec83e08d5c.jpg)

Figure 8-10.  Blocked pitot system with clear static system.  

must include two components: static pressure and  dynamic pressure.  

It can be inferred that airspeed indication must be based upon  a relationship between these two pressures, and indeed it is.  An ASI uses the static pressure as a reference pressure and  as a result, the ASI’s case is kept at this pressure behind the  diaphragm. On the other hand, the dynamic pressure through  the pitot tube is connected to a highly sensitive diaphragm  within the ASI case. Because an aircraft in zero motion  (regardless of altitude) results in a zero airspeed, the pitot tube  always provides static pressure in addition to dynamic pressure.  

Therefore, the airspeed indication is the result of two  pressures: the pitot tube static and dynamic pressure within  the diaphragm as measured against the static pressure in the  ASI’s case.  

diaphragm causing it to compress, thereby resulting in an  indication of decreased airspeed. Conversely, if the aircraft  were to climb, the static pressure would decrease allowing  the diaphragm to expand, thereby showing an indication of  greater airspeed.  [Figure 8-10]  

The pitot tube may become blocked during flight due to  visible moisture. Some aircraft may be equipped with pitot  heat for flight in visible moisture. Consult the AFM/POH for  specific procedures regarding the use of pitot heat.  

# Blocked Static System  

If the static system becomes blocked but the pitot tube  remains clear, the ASI continues to operate; however, it  is inaccurate. The airspeed indicates lower than the actual  airspeed when the aircraft is operated above the altitude  where the static ports became blocked because the trapped  static pressure is higher than normal for that altitude. When  operating at a lower altitude, a faster than actual airspeed is  displayed due to the relatively low static pressure trapped  in the system.  

Revisiting the ratios that were used to explain a blocked pitot  tube, the same principle applies for a blocked static port. If  the aircraft descends, the static pressure increases on the pitot  side showing an increase on the ASI. This assumes that the  aircraft does not actually increase its speed. The increase in  static pressure on the pitot side is equivalent to an increase  in dynamic pressure since the pressure cannot change on  the static side.  

If an aircraft begins to climb after a static port becomes  blocked, the airspeed begins to show a decrease as the  aircraft continues to climb. This is due to the decrease in  static pressure on the pitot side, while the pressure on the  static side is held constant.  

A blockage of the static system also affects the altimeter and  VSI. Trapped static pressure causes the altimeter to freeze  at the altitude where the blockage occurred. In the case of  the VSI, a blocked static system produces a continuous zero  indication.  [Figure 8-11]  

Some aircraft are equipped with an alternate static source in  the flight deck. In the case of a blocked static source, opening  the alternate static source introduces static pressure from the  flight deck into the system. Flight deck static pressure is lower  than outside static pressure. Check the aircraft AOM/POH for  airspeed corrections when utilizing alternate static pressure.  

If the aircraft were to descend while the pitot tube is  obstructed, the pressure in the pitot system, including the  diaphragm, would remain constant. But as the descent  is made, the static pressure would increase against the  

![](images/9650b5b56ed40f29e7359a9ffe0bdc796f933051fc9fe41b1e8a0ce4220ad797.jpg)

# Electronic Flight Display (EFD)  

Advances in technology have brought about changes in the  instrumentation found in all types of aircraft; for example,  Electronic Flight Displays (EFDs) commonly referred to  as “glass cockpits.” EFDs include flight displays such as  primary flight displays (PFD) and multi-function displays  (MFD). This has changed not only what information is  available to a pilot, but also how the information is displayed.  In addition to the improvement in system reliability, which  increases overall safety, EFDs have decreased the overall cost  of equipping aircraft with state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Primary electronic instrumentation packages are less prone  to failure than their analogue counterparts. No longer is it  necessary for aircraft designers to create cluttered panel  layouts in order to accommodate all necessary flight  instruments. Instead, multi-panel digital flight displays  combine all flight instruments onto a single screen that is  called a primary flight display (PFD). The traditional “six  pack” of instruments is now displayed on one liquid crystal  display (LCD) screen.  

# Airspeed Tape  

Configured similarly to traditional panel layouts, the ASI  is located on the left side of the screen and is displayed as  a vertical speed tape. As the aircraft increases in speed, the  larger numbers descend from the top of the tape. The TAS is  displayed at the bottom of the tape through the input to the air  data computer (ADC) from the outside air temperature probe.  Airspeed markings for  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  ,  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , and rotation speed   $({\bf V}_{\mathrm{R}})$   are  displayed for pilot reference. An additional pilot-controlled  airspeed bug is available to set at any desired reference speed.  As on traditional analogue ASIs, the electronic airspeed tape  displays the color-coded ranges for the flap operating range,  

![](images/4e46108eda0c53d76479fc6c4b16e19c412a421c4f1da34b4e0e30d00c70b810.jpg)

normal range, and caution range.  [Figure 8-12]  The number  value changes color to red when the airspeed exceeds  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   to  warn the pilot of exceeding the maximum speed limitation.  

# Attitude Indicator  

One improvement over analogue instrumentation is the  larger attitude indicator on EFD. The artificial horizon spans  the entire width of the PFD.  [Figure 8-12]  This expanded  instrumentation offers better reference through all phases of  flight and all flight maneuvers. The attitude indicator receives  its information from the Attitude Heading and Reference  System (AHRS).  

# Altimeter  

The altimeter is located on the right side of the PFD.  [Figure 8-12]  As the altitude increases, the larger numbers  descend from the top of the display tape, with the current  altitude being displayed in the black box in the center of the  display tape. The altitude is displayed in increments of 20 feet.  

# Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)  

The VSI is displayed to the right of the altimeter tape and can  take the form of an arced indicator or a vertical speed tape.  [Figure 8-12]  Both are equipped with a vertical speed bug.  

# Heading Indicator  

The heading indicator is located below the artificial horizon  and is normally modeled after a Horizontal Situation  Indicator (HSI).  [Figure 8-12]  As in the case of the attitude  indicator, the heading indicator receives its information from  the magnetometer, which feeds information to the AHRS unit  and then out to the PFD.  

# Turn Indicator  

The turn indicator takes a slightly different form than the  traditional instrumentation. A sliding bar moves left and right  below the triangle to indicate deflection from coordinated  flight.  [Figure 8-12]  Reference for coordinated flight comes  from accelerometers contained in the AHRS unit.  

# Tachometer  

The sixth instrument normally associated with the “six pack”  package is the tachometer. This is the only instrument that is  not located on the PFD. The tachometer is normally located  on the multi-function display (MFD). In the event of a display  screen failure, it is displayed on the remaining screen with  the PFD flight instrumentation.  [Figure 8-13]  

# Slip/Skid Indicator  

The slip/skid indicator is the horizontal line below the roll  pointer.  [Figure 8-12]  Like a ball in a turn-and-slip indicator,  a bar width off center is equal to one ball width displacement.  

# Turn Rate Indicator  

The turn rate indicator, illustrated in  Figure 8-12 , is typically  found directly above the rotating compass card. Tick marks to  the left and right of the lubber line denote the turn (standard- rate versus half standard-rate). Typically denoted by a trend  line, if the trend vector is extended to the second tick mark  the aircraft is in a standard-rate turn.  

Individual panel displays can be configured for a variety  of aircraft by installing different software packages.  [Figure 8-14]  Manufacturers are also able to upgrade existing  instrument displays in a similar manner, eliminating the need  to replace individual gauges in order to upgrade.

Figure 8-14.  Chelton’s FlightLogic (top) and Avidyne’s Entegra (bottom) are examples of panel displays that are configurable.  

# Air Data Computer (ADC)  

EFDs utilize the same type of instrument inputs as traditional  analogue gauges; however, the processing system is different.  The pitot static inputs are received by an ADC. The ADC  computes the difference between the total pressure and the  static pressure and generates the information necessary to  display the airspeed on the PFD. Outside air temperatures  are also monitored and introduced into various components  within the system, as well as being displayed on the PFD  screen.  [Figure 8-15]  

The ADC is a separate solid state device that, in addition to  providing data to the PFD, is capable of providing data to the  autopilot control system. In the event of system malfunction, the  ADC can quickly be removed and replaced in order to decrease  downtime and decrease maintenance turn-around times.  

Altitude information is derived from the static pressure port  just as an analogue system does; however, the static pressure

does not enter a diaphragm. The ADC computes the received  barometric pressure and sends a digital signal to the PFD to  display the proper altitude readout. EFDs also show trend  vectors, which show the pilot how the altitude and airspeed  are progressing.  

# Trend Vectors  

Trend vectors are magenta lines that move up and down both  the ASI and the altimeter.  [Figures 8-16 and 8-17]  The ADC  computes the rate of change and displays the 6-second projection  of where the aircraft will be. Pilots can utilize the trend vectors  to better control the aircraft’s attitude. By including the trend  vectors in the instrument scan, pilots are able to precisely control  airspeed and altitude. Additional information can be obtained  by referencing the Instrument Flying Handbook or specific  avionics manufacturer’s training material.

# Gyroscopic Flight Instruments  

Several flight instruments utilize the properties of a gyroscope  for their operation. The most common instruments containing  gyroscopes are the turn coordinator, heading indicator, and  the attitude indicator. To understand how these instruments  operate requires knowledge of the instrument power systems,  gyroscopic principles, and the operating principles of each  instrument.  

# Gyroscopic Principles  

Any spinning object exhibits gyroscopic properties. A wheel  or rotor designed and mounted to utilize these properties is  called a gyroscope. Two important design characteristics  of an instrument gyro are great weight for its size, or high  density, and rotation at high speed with low friction bearings.  

There are two general types of mountings; the type used  depends upon which property of the gyro is utilized. A freely  or universally mounted gyroscope is free to rotate in any  direction about its center of gravity. Such a wheel is said to  have three planes of freedom. The wheel or rotor is free to  rotate in any plane in relation to the base and is balanced so  that, with the gyro wheel at rest, it remains in the position  in which it is placed. Restricted or semi-rigidly mounted  gyroscopes are those mounted so that one of the planes of  freedom is held fixed in relation to the base.  

There are two fundamental properties of gyroscopic action:  rigidity in space and precession.  

# Rigidity in Space  

Rigidity in space refers to the principle that a gyroscope  remains in a fixed position in the plane in which it is spinning.  An example of rigidity in space is that of a bicycle wheel. As  the bicycle wheels increase speed, they become more stable in  their plane of rotation. This is why a bicycle is unstable and  maneuverable at low speeds and stable and less maneuverable  at higher speeds.  

By mounting this wheel, or gyroscope, on a set of gimbal  rings, the gyro is able to rotate freely in any direction. Thus,  if the gimbal rings are tilted, twisted, or otherwise moved,  the gyro remains in the plane in which it was originally  spinning.  [Figure 8-18]  

# Precession  

Precession is the tilting or turning of a gyro in response to a  deflective force. The reaction to this force does not occur at  the point at which it was applied; rather, it occurs at a point  that is  $90^{\circ}$   later in the direction of rotation. This principle  allows the gyro to determine a rate of turn by sensing the  amount of pressure created by a change in direction. The rate  at which the gyro precesses is inversely proportional to the  speed of the rotor and proportional to the deflective force.  

Using the example of the bicycle, precession acts on the  wheels in order to allow the bicycle to turn. While riding  at normal speed, it is not necessary to turn the handle bars  in the direction of the desired turn. A rider simply leans in  the direction that he or she wishes to go. Since the wheels  are rotating in a clockwise direction when viewed from the  right side of the bicycle, if a rider leans to the left, a force is  applied to the top of the wheel to the left. The force actually  acts   $90^{\circ}$   in the direction of rotation, which has the effect of  applying a force to the front of the tire, causing the bicycle

Figure 8-18.  Regardless of the position of its base, a gyro tends to remain rigid in space, with its axis of rotation pointed in a constant  direction.  

to move to the left. There is a need to turn the handlebars at  low speeds because of the instability of the slowly turning  gyros and also to increase the rate of turn.  

Precession can also create some minor errors in some  instruments.  [Figure 8-19]  Precession can cause a freely  spinning gyro to become displaced from its intended plane  of rotation through bearing friction, etc. Certain instruments  may require corrective realignment during flight, such as the  heading indicator.  

# Sources of Power  

In some aircraft, all the gyros are vacuum, pressure, or  electrically operated. In other aircraft, vacuum or pressure  systems provide the power for the heading and attitude  indicators, while the electrical system provides the power for  the turn coordinator. Most aircraft have at least two sources  of power to ensure at least one source of bank information is  available if one power source fails. The vacuum or pressure  system spins the gyro by drawing a stream of air against the  rotor vanes to spin the rotor at high speed, much like the  operation of a waterwheel or turbine. The amount of vacuum  or pressure required for instrument operation varies, but is  usually between  $4.5\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   and   $5.5\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .  

One source of vacuum for the gyros is a vane-type engine- driven pump that is mounted on the accessory case of the  engine. Pump capacity varies in different aircraft, depending  on the number of gyros.  

A typical vacuum system consists of an engine-driven  vacuum pump, relief valve, air filter, gauge, and tubing  necessary to complete the connections. The gauge is mounted  in the aircraft’s instrument panel and indicates the amount  

![](images/262d5c6856ff10959ae80da5f725619dbaebc03ecb66d44cff761ca1a958d5e4.jpg)  
Figure 8-19.  Precession of a gyroscope resulting from an applied deflective force.  

of pressure in the system (vacuum is measured in inches of  mercury less than ambient pressure).  

As shown in  Figure 8-20,  air is drawn into the vacuum  system by the engine-driven vacuum pump. It first goes  through a filter, which prevents foreign matter from entering  the vacuum or pressure system. The air then moves through  the attitude and heading indicators where it causes the gyros  to spin. A relief valve prevents the vacuum pressure, or  suction, from exceeding prescribed limits. After that, the air  is expelled overboard or used in other systems, such as for  inflating pneumatic deicing boots.  

It is important to monitor vacuum pressure during flight,  because the attitude and heading indicators may not provide  reliable information when suction pressure is low. The  vacuum, or suction, gauge is generally marked to indicate  the normal range. Some aircraft are equipped with a warning  light that illuminates when the vacuum pressure drops below  the acceptable level.  

When the vacuum pressure drops below the normal operating  range, the gyroscopic instruments may become unstable and  inaccurate. Cross-checking the instruments routinely is a  good habit to develop.  

# Turn Indicators  

Aircraft use two types of turn indicators: turn-and-slip  indicators and turn coordinators. Because of the way the gyro  is mounted, the turn-and-slip indicator shows only the rate of  turn in degrees per second. The turn coordinator is mounted  at an angle, or canted, so it can initially show roll rate. When  the roll stabilizes, it indicates rate of turn. Both instruments  indicate turn direction and quality (coordination), and also  serve as a backup source of bank information in the event an  attitude indicator fails. Coordination is achieved by referring  to the inclinometer, which consists of a liquid-filled curved  tube with a ball inside.  [Figure 8-21]  

# Turn-and-Slip Indicator  

The gyro in the turn-and-slip indicator rotates in the vertical  plane corresponding to the aircraft’s longitudinal axis. A  single gimbal limits the planes in which the gyro can tilt,  and a spring works to maintain a center position. Because of  precession, a yawing force causes the gyro to tilt left or right,  as viewed from the pilot seat. The turn-and-slip indicator  uses a pointer, called the turn needle, to show the direction  and rate of turn. The turn-and-slip indicator is incapable of  “tumbling” off its rotational axis because of the restraining  springs. When extreme forces are applied to a gyro, the gyro  is displaced from its normal plane of rotation, rendering its  indications invalid. Certain instruments have specific pitch  and bank limits that induce a tumble of the gyro.

Figure 8-20.  Typical vacuum system.  

# Turn Coordinator  

The gimbal in the turn coordinator is canted; therefore, its  gyro can sense both rate of roll and rate of turn. Since turn  coordinators are more prevalent in training aircraft, this  discussion concentrates on that instrument. When rolling into  or out of a turn, the miniature aircraft banks in the direction  the aircraft is rolled. A rapid roll rate causes the miniature  aircraft to bank more steeply than a slow roll rate.  

aircraft with the turn index.  Figure 8-22  shows a picture of a  turn coordinator. There are two marks on each side (left and  right) of the face of the instrument. The first mark is used to  reference a wings level zero rate of turn. The second mark  on the left and right side of the instrument serve to indicate  a standard rate of turn. A standard-rate turn is defined as a  turn rate of  $3^{\circ}$   per second. The turn coordinator indicates only  the rate and direction of turn; it does not display a specific  angle of bank.  

The turn coordinator can be used to establish and maintain  a standard-rate turn by aligning the wing of the miniature

Figure 8-22.  If inadequate right rudder is applied in a right turn,  a slip results. Too much right rudder causes the aircraft to skid  through the turn. Centering the ball results in a coordinated turn.  

# Inclinometer  

The inclinometer is used to depict aircraft yaw, which is  the side-to-side movement of the aircraft’s nose. During  coordinated, straight-and-level flight, the force of gravity  causes the ball to rest in the lowest part of the tube, centered  between the reference lines. Coordinated flight is maintained  by keeping the ball centered. If the ball is not centered, it can  be centered by using the rudder.  

To center the ball, apply rudder pressure on the side to  which the ball is deflected. Use the simple rule, “step on the  ball,” to remember which rudder pedal to press. If aileron  and rudder are coordinated during a turn, the ball remains  centered in the tube. If aerodynamic forces are unbalanced,  the ball moves away from the center of the tube. As shown  in  Figure 8-22,  in a slip, the rate of turn is too slow for the  angle of bank, and the ball moves to the inside of the turn. In  a skid, the rate of turn is too great for the angle of bank, and  the ball moves to the outside of the turn. To correct for these  conditions, and improve the quality of the turn, remember to  “step on the ball.” Varying the angle of bank can also help  restore coordinated flight from a slip or skid. To correct for a  slip, decrease bank and/or increase the rate of turn. To correct  for a skid, increase the bank and/or decrease the rate of turn.  

# Yaw String  

to the center of the wind screen. When in coordinated flight,  the string trails straight back over the top of the wind screen.  When the aircraft is either slipping or skidding, the yaw  string moves to the right or left depending on the direction  of slip or skid.  

# Instrument Check  

During preflight, ensure that the inclinometer is full of fluid  and has no air bubbles. The ball should also be resting at  its lowest point. When taxiing, the turn coordinator should  indicate a turn in the correct direction while the ball moves  opposite the direction of the turn.  

# Attitude Indicator  

The attitude indicator, with its miniature aircraft and horizon  bar, displays a picture of the attitude of the aircraft. The  relationship of the miniature aircraft to the horizon bar is  the same as the relationship of the real aircraft to the actual  horizon. The instrument gives an instantaneous indication of  even the smallest changes in attitude.  

The gyro in the attitude indicator is mounted in a horizontal  plane and depends upon rigidity in space for its operation.  The horizon bar represents the true horizon. This bar is  fixed to the gyro and remains in a horizontal plane as the  aircraft is pitched or banked about its lateral or longitudinal  axis, indicating the attitude of the aircraft relative to the true  horizon.  [Figure 8-23]  

The gyro spins in the horizontal plane and resists deflection  of the rotational path. Since the gyro relies on rigidity in  space, the aircraft actually rotates around the spinning gyro.  

![](images/77ec4d27c581f021b44f0b4b9bc69f5f7dbda151377b9d017c5b9d3195d0ab4a.jpg)  
Figure 8-23.  Attitude indicator.  

One additional tool that can be added to the aircraft is a yaw  string. A yaw string is simply a string or piece of yarn attached  An adjustment knob is provided with which the pilot may move  the miniature aircraft up or down to align the miniature aircraft with  the horizon bar to suit the pilot’s line of vision. Normally, the  miniature aircraft is adjusted so that the wings overlap the horizon  bar when the aircraft is in straight-and-level cruising flight.  

The pitch and bank limits of an attitude indicator depend upon  the make and model of the instrument. Some attitude indicators  have limits in the banking plane from   $100^{\circ}$   to   $110^{\circ}$  , and the pitch  limits can be from   $60^{\circ}$   to   $70^{\circ}$  . For those attitude indicators that  display only pitch information of   $+/-~25^{\circ}$   vertically, the  instrument could "peg" (stop) and remain at this pitch indication  until the pitch no longer exceeds limitation or "tumble" and  provide erroneous pitch and bank indications when the aircraft  exceeds these limits. This may be extremely hazardous when the  aircraft is operating in instrument meteorological conditions or  confuse a pilot during an unusual attitude recovery. A number of  modern attitude indicators do not have this problem.  

Every pilot should be able to interpret the banking scale  illustrated in Figure 8-24. Most banking scale indicators on the  top of the instrument move in the same direction from that in  which the aircraft is actually banked. Some other models move  in the opposite direction from that in which the aircraft is  actually banked. This may confuse the pilot if the indicator is used  to determine the direction of bank. This scale should be used only  to control the degree of desired bank. The relationship of the  miniature aircraft to the horizon bar should be used for an indication  of the direction of bank. The attitude indicator is reliable and the  most realistic flight instrument on the instrument panel. Its  indications are very close approximations of the actual attitude of  the aircraft.  

# Heading Indicator  

The heading indicator is fundamentally a mechanical  instrument designed to facilitate the use of the magnetic  compass. Errors in the magnetic compass are numerous,  

![](images/d4bf95432c5e19ffab00eaa69089690575e8a6691b7ff1a7c59544327b6ce0e3.jpg)  
Figure 8-24.  Attitude representation by the attitude indicator corresponds to the relation of the aircraft to the real horizon.  

making straight flight and precision turns to headings difficult  to accomplish, particularly in turbulent air. A heading  indicator, however, is not affected by the forces that make  the magnetic compass difficult to interpret.  [Figure 8-25]  

The operation of the heading indicator depends upon the  principle of rigidity in space. The rotor turns in a vertical  plane and fixed to the rotor is a compass card. Since the rotor  remains rigid in space, the points on the card hold the same  position in space relative to the vertical plane of the gyro. The  aircraft actually rotates around the rotating gyro, not the other  way around. As the instrument case and the aircraft revolve  around the vertical axis of the gyro, the card provides clear  and accurate heading information.  

Because of precession caused by friction, the heading  indicator creeps or drifts from its set position. Among  other factors, the amount of drift depends largely upon the  condition of the instrument. If the bearings are worn, dirty,  or improperly lubricated, the drift may be excessive. Another  error in the heading indicator is caused by the fact that the  gyro is oriented in space, and the Earth rotates in space at a  rate of   $15^{\circ}$   in 1 hour. Thus, discounting precession caused  by friction, the heading indicator may indicate as much as   $15^{\circ}$   error per every hour of operation.  

Some heading indicators referred to as horizontal situation  indicators (HSI) receive a magnetic north reference from  a magnetic slaving transmitter and generally need no  adjustment. The magnetic slaving transmitter is called  a magnetometer.  

![](images/10c604dde32fb997233c2cfa96968b8718eecb9a418ef5789e001cf9db85b1d4.jpg)  
Figure 8-25.  A heading indicator displays headings based on a  $360^{\circ}$  azimuth, with the final zero omitted. For example, “  $\cdot6^{\cdot,}$   represents   $O6O^{\circ}$  , while   $^{**}2I^{**}$   indicates   $2I O^{\circ}$  . The adjustment knob is used to  align the heading indicator with the magnetic compass.  

# Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)  

Electronic flight displays have replaced free-spinning gyros  with solid-state laser systems that are capable of flight at  any attitude without tumbling. This capability is the result  of the development of the Attitude and Heading Reference  System (AHRS).  

The AHRS sends attitude information to the PFD in order  to generate the pitch and bank information of the attitude  indicator. The heading information is derived from a  magnetometer that senses the earth’s lines of magnetic flux.  This information is then processed and sent out to the PFD  to generate the heading display.  [Figure 8-26]  

# The Flux Gate Compass System  

As mentioned earlier, the lines of flux in the Earth’s magnetic  field have two basic characteristics: a magnet aligns with  them, and an electrical current is induced, or generated, in  any wire crossed by them.  

The flux gate compass that drives slaved gyros uses the  characteristic of current induction. The flux valve is a small,  segmented ring, like the one in  Figure 8-27,  made of soft iron  that readily accepts lines of magnetic flux. An electrical coil  is wound around each of the three legs to accept the current  induced in this ring by the Earth’s magnetic field. A coil  wound around the iron spacer in the center of the frame has   $400\:\mathrm{Hz}$   alternating current (AC) flowing through it. During  the times when this current reaches its peak, twice during  each cycle, there is so much magnetism produced by this  coil that the frame cannot accept the lines of flux from the  Earth’s field.  

![](images/7d4775b31209b1fb0aeb15711a4632606a4b359a5fb46a5ef4148cd2a6859570.jpg)

Figure 8-27.  The soft iron frame of the flux valve accepts the flux from  the Earth’s magnetic field each time the current in the center coil  Figure 3-23.   The soft iron frame of the flux valve accepts the reverses. This flux causes current to flow in the three pickup coils.  

As the current reverses between the peaks, it demagnetizes  the frame so it can accept the flux from the Earth’s field. As  this flux cuts across the windings in the three coils, it causes  current to flow in them. These three coils are connected in  such a way that the current flowing in them changes as the  heading of the aircraft changes.  [Figure 8-28]  

The three coils are connected to three similar but smaller  coils in a synchro inside the instrument case. The synchro  rotates the dial of a radio magnetic indicator (RMI) or a HSI.  

![](images/9486cce2cc6acfd087d5cb0e7a3bcb9f657505930f48243c480d043ee0e44856.jpg)  
Figure 8-28.  The current in each of the three pickup coils changes  with the heading of the aircraft.  

# Remote Indicating Compass  

Remote indicating compasses were developed to compensate  for the errors and limitations of the older type of heading  indicators. The two panel-mounted components of a typical  system are the pictorial navigation indicator and the slaving  control and compensator unit.  [Figure 8-29]  The pictorial  navigation indicator is commonly referred to as an HSI.  

The slaving control and compensator unit has a push button  that provides a means of selecting either the “slaved gyro”  or “free gyro” mode. This unit also has a slaving meter  and two manual heading-drive buttons. The slaving meter  indicates the difference between the displayed heading and  the magnetic heading. A right deflection indicates a clockwise  error of the compass card; a left deflection indicates a  counterclockwise error. Whenever the aircraft is in a turn  and the card rotates, the slaving meter shows a full deflection  to one side or the other. When the system is in “free gyro”  mode, the compass card may be adjusted by depressing the  appropriate heading-drive button.  

A separate unit, the magnetic slaving transmitter, is mounted  remotely, usually in a wingtip to eliminate the possibility of  magnetic interference. It contains the flux valve, which is  the direction-sensing device of the system. A concentration  of lines of magnetic force, after being amplified, becomes  

![](images/1c647e965369b6bbe2e505bf45bd239aaf821fd0c5a9c22f9d636bca2f144169.jpg)  
Figure 8-29.  Pictorial navigation indicator (HSI, top), slaving meter  (lower right), and slaving control compensator unit (lower left).  

a signal relayed to the heading indicator unit, which is also  remotely mounted. This signal operates a torque motor in  the heading indicator unit that processes the gyro unit until  it is aligned with the transmitter signal. The magnetic slaving  transmitter is connected electrically to the HSI.  

There are a number of designs of the remote indicating  compass; therefore, only the basic features of the system are  covered here. Instrument pilots must become familiar with  the characteristics of the equipment in their aircraft.  

As instrument panels become more crowded and the pilot’s  available scan time is reduced by a heavier flight deck  workload, instrument manufacturers have worked toward  combining instruments. One good example of this is the  RMI in  Figure 8-30.  The compass card is driven by signals  from the flux valve, and the two pointers are driven by an  automatic direction finder (ADF) and a very high frequency  (VHF) omni-directional radio range (VOR).  

Heading indicators that do not have this automatic  northseeking capability are called “free” gyros and require  periodic adjustment. It is important to check the indications  frequently (approximately every 15 minutes) and reset the  heading indicator to align it with the magnetic compass  when required. Adjust the heading indicator to the magnetic  compass heading when the aircraft is straight and level at a  constant speed to avoid compass errors.  

The bank and pitch limits of the heading indicator vary  with the particular design and make of instrument. On some  heading indicators found in light aircraft, the limits are  approximately   $55^{\circ}$   of pitch and  $55^{\circ}$   of bank. When either of  these attitude limits is exceeded, the instrument “tumbles”  

![](images/72cb98b405c45bb013312ce065b4e00a388756d36ab2bf055b9e2d21c64f753e.jpg)  
Figure 8-30.  Driven by signals from a flux valve, the compass card  in this RMI indicates the heading of the aircraft opposite the upper  center index mark. The green pointer is driven by the ADF.  

or “spills” and no longer gives the correct indication until  reset. After spilling, it may be reset with the caging knob.  Many of the modern instruments used are designed in such  a manner so that they do not tumble.  

An additional precession error may occur due to a gyro not  spinning fast enough to maintain its alignment. When the  vacuum system stops producing adequate suction to maintain  the gyro speed, the heading indicator and the attitude indicator  gyros begin to slow down. As they slow, they become more  susceptible to deflection from the plane of rotation. Some  aircraft have warning lights to indicate that a low vacuum  situation has occurred. Other aircraft may have only a vacuum  gauge that indicates the suction.  

# Instrument Check  

As the gyro spools up, make sure there are no abnormal  sounds. While taxiing, the instrument should indicate turns in  the correct direction, and precession should be normal. At idle  power settings, the gyroscopic instruments using the vacuum  system might not be up to operating speeds and precession  might occur more rapidly than during flight.  

# Angle of Attack Indicators  

The purpose of an AOA indicator is to give the pilot better  situational awareness pertaining to the aerodynamic health  of the airfoil. This can also be referred to as stall margin  awareness. More simply explained, it is the margin that exists  between the current AOA that the airfoil is operating at, and  the AOA at which the airfoil will stall (critical AOA).  

Speed by itself is not a reliable parameter to avoid a stall.  An airplane can stall at any speed. Angle of attack is a better  parameter to use to avoid a stall. For a given configuration,  the airplane always stalls at the same AOA, referred to as  the critical AOA. This critical AOA does not change with:  

• 	 Weight • 	 Bank Angle • 	 Temperature • 	 Density Altitude • 	 Center of Gravity  

An AOA indicator can have several benefits when installed in  General Aviation aircraft, not the least of which is increased  situational awareness. Without an AOA indicator, the AOA  is “invisible” to pilots. These devices measure several  parameters simultaneously and determine the current AOA  providing a visual image to the pilot of the current AOA along  with representations of the proximity to the critical AOA.  [Figure 8-31]  These devices can give a visual representation  of the energy management state of the airplane. The energy

state of an airplane is the balance between airspeed, altitude,  drag, and thrust and represents how efficiently the airfoil is  operating.  

# Compass Systems  

The Earth is a huge magnet, spinning in space, surrounded  by a magnetic field made up of invisible lines of flux. These  lines leave the surface at the magnetic North Pole and reenter  at the magnetic South Pole.  

Lines of magnetic flux have two important characteristics:  any magnet that is free to rotate will align with them, and  an electrical current is induced into any conductor that cuts  across them. Most direction indicators installed in aircraft  make use of one of these two characteristics.  

# Magnetic Compass  

One of the oldest and simplest instruments for indicating  direction is the magnetic compass. It is also one of the basic  instruments required by Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 for both VFR and IFR flight.  

A magnet is a piece of material, usually a metal containing  iron, that attracts and holds lines of magnetic flux. Regardless  of size, every magnet has two poles: north and south. When  one magnet is placed in the field of another, the unlike poles  attract each other, and like poles repel.  

An aircraft magnetic compass, such as the one in  Figure 8-32, has two small magnets attached to a metal float sealed inside a  bowl of clear compass fluid similar to kerosene. A graduated  scale, called a card, is wrapped around the float and viewed  through a glass window with a lubber line across it. The card  is marked with letters representing the cardinal directions,  north, east, south, and west, and a number for each   $30^{\circ}$  between these letters. The final   $"0"$   is omitted from these  directions. For example,   $3=30^{\circ}$  ,   $6=60^{\circ}$  , and   $33=330^{\circ}$  .  

There are long and short graduation marks between the letters  and numbers, each long mark representing  $10^{\circ}$   and each short  mark representing  $5^{\circ}$  .  

The float and card assembly has a hardened steel pivot in its  center that rides inside a special, spring-loaded, hard glass  jewel cup. The buoyancy of the float takes most of the weight  off of the pivot, and the fluid damps the oscillation of the  float and card. This jewel-and-pivot type mounting allows the  float freedom to rotate and tilt up to approximately  $18^{\circ}$   angle  of bank. At steeper bank angles, the compass indications are  erratic and unpredictable.  

The compass housing is entirely full of compass fluid. To  prevent damage or leakage when the fluid expands and  contracts with temperature changes, the rear of the compass  case is sealed with a flexible diaphragm, or with a metal  bellows in some compasses.  

The magnets align with the Earth’s magnetic field and the  pilot reads the direction on the scale opposite the lubber  line. Note that in  Figure 8-32,  the pilot views the compass  

![](images/aa93217385ee29180af59ccc976ed9bf81a6c00a06ff1b2d03329e08c1fa4542.jpg)

card from its backside. When the pilot is flying north, as the  compass indicates, east is to the pilot’s right. On the card,  “33,” which represents  $330^{\circ}$   (west of north), is to the right of  north. The reason for this apparent backward graduation is  that the card remains stationary, and the compass housing and  the pilot rotate around it. Because of this setup, the magnetic  compass can be confusing to read.  

# Magnetic Compass Induced Errors  

The magnetic compass is the simplest instrument in  the panel, but it is subject to a number of errors that must  be considered.  

Variation  

The Earth rotates about its geographic axis; maps and charts  are drawn using meridians of longitude that pass through the  geographic poles. Directions measured from the geographic  poles are called true directions. The magnetic North Pole to  which the magnetic compass points is not collocated with  the geographic North Pole, but is some 1,300 miles away;  directions measured from the magnetic poles are called  magnetic directions. In aerial navigation, the difference  between true and magnetic directions is called variation. This  same angular difference in surveying and land navigation is  called declination.  

Figure 8-33  shows the isogonic lines that identify the number  of degrees of variation in their area. The line that passes near  Chicago is called the agonic line. Anywhere along this line  the two poles are aligned, and there is no variation. East  of this line, the magnetic North Pole is to the west of the  geographic North Pole and a correction must be applied to  a compass indication to get a true direction.  

Flying in the Washington, D.C., area, for example, the  variation is  $10^{\circ}$   west. If a pilot wants to fly a true course of  south   $(180^{\circ})$  , the variation must be added to this, resulting in  a magnetic course of   $190^{\circ}$   to fly. Flying in the Los Angeles,  California area, the variation is  $14^{\circ}$   east. To fly a true course  of   $180^{\circ}$   there, the pilot would have to subtract the variation  and fly a magnetic course of   $166^{\circ}$  . The variation error does  not change with the heading of the aircraft; it is the same  anywhere along the isogonic line.  

# Deviation  

The magnets in a compass align with any magnetic field.  Some causes for magnetic fields in aircraft include flowing  electrical current, magnetized parts, and conflict with the  Earth’s magnetic field. These aircraft magnetic fields create  a compass error called deviation.  

Deviation, unlike variation, depends on the aircraft heading.  Also unlike variation, the aircraft’s geographic location  does not affect deviation. While no one can reduce or  change variation error, an aviation maintenance technician  (AMT) can provide the means to minimize deviation error  by performing the maintenance task known as “swinging  the compass.”  

![](images/1ff93114fc796aafd68f9ec4d1b106b113cf275ac21cb3251d4ea024df828334.jpg)  
Figure 8-33.  Isogonic lines are lines of equal variation.  

To swing the compass, an AMT positions the aircraft  on a series of known headings, usually at a compass  rose.  [Figure 8-34]  A compass rose consists of a series  of lines marked every   $30^{\circ}$   on an airport ramp, oriented to  magnetic north. There is minimal magnetic interference at  the compass rose. The pilot or the AMT, if authorized, can  taxi the aircraft to the compass rose and maneuver the aircraft  to the headings prescribed by the AMT.  

As the aircraft is “swung” or aligned to each compass rose  heading, the AMT adjusts the compensator assembly located  on the top or bottom of the compass. The compensator  assembly has two shafts whose ends have screwdriver slots  accessible from the front of the compass. Each shaft rotates  one or two small compensating magnets. The end of one shaft  is marked E-W, and its magnets affect the compass when the  aircraft is pointed east or west. The other shaft is marked  N-S and its magnets affect the compass when the aircraft is  pointed north or south.  

The adjustments position the compensating magnets to  minimize the difference between the compass indication and  the actual aircraft magnetic heading. The AMT records any  remaining error on a compass correction card like the one  in  Figure 8-35  and places it in a holder near the compass.  Only AMTs can adjust the compass or complete the compass  correction card. Pilots determine and fly compass headings  using the deviation errors noted on the card. Pilots must also  note the use of any equipment causing operational magnetic  interference such as radios, deicing equipment, pitot heat,  radar, or magnetic cargo.  

The corrections for variation and deviation must be applied  in the correct sequence as shown below, starting from the  true course desired.  

![](images/9ed1911b6453ee33033b49a6ae046e9901b883ec5a75b279065f8d00c42e30a6.jpg)  
Figure 8-34.  Utilization of a compass rose aids compensation for deviation errors.  

![Figure 8-35.  A compass correction card shows the deviation  correction for any heading. ](images/17759eb07cb703ac9d0d730ecaa0061c7f5c98c77fa538dae8ff722f1f1f6310.jpg)  

Step 1: Determine the Magnetic Course True Course   $(180^{\circ})\pm\mathrm{~V~}$  ariation   $(+10^{\circ})=\mathbf{M}\mathbf{a}$  agnetic Course   $(190^{\circ})$  

The magnetic course  $(190^{\circ})$   is steered if there is no deviation  error to be applied. The compass card must now be considered  for the compass course of   $190^{\circ}$  .  

Step 2: Determine the Compass Course Magnetic Course (  $190^{\circ}$  , from step 1)  $\pm$   Deviation   $(-2^{\circ}$  , from  correction card)  $=$  Compass Course   $(188^{\circ})$  )  

NOTE: Intermediate magnetic courses between those listed  on the compass card need to be interpreted. Therefore, to  steer a true course of  $180^{\circ}$  , the pilot would follow a compass  course of   $188^{\circ}$  .  

To find the true course that is being flown when the compass  course is known: Compass Course  $\pm$   Deviation  $=$  Magnetic Course ±  Variation  $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=$   True Course  

# Dip Errors  

The Earth's magnetic field runs parallel to its surface only at  the Magnetic Equator, which is the point halfway between  the Magnetic North and South Poles. As you move away  from the Magnetic Equator towards the magnetic poles, the  angle created by the vertical pull of the Earth's magnetic field  in relation to the Earth’s surface increases gradually. This  angle is known as the dip angle. The dip angle increases in  a downward direction as you move towards the Magnetic  North Pole and increases in an upward direction as you move  towards the Magnetic South Pole.  

If the compass needle were mounted so that it could pivot  freely in three dimensions, it would align itself with the  magnetic field, pointing up or down at the dip angle in the  direction of local Magnetic North. Because the dip angle is  of no navigational interest, the compass is made so that it can  rotate only in the horizontal plane. This is done by lowering  the center of gravity below the pivot point and making the  assembly heavy enough that the vertical component of the  magnetic force is too weak to tilt it significantly out of the  horizontal plane. The compass can then work effectively at  all latitudes without specific compensation for dip. However,  close to the magnetic poles, the horizontal component of  the Earth’s field is too small to align the compass which  makes the compass unusable for navigation. Because of this  constraint, the compass only indicates correctly if the card  is horizontal. Once tilted out of the horizontal plane, it will  be affected by the vertical component of the Earth’s field  which leads to the following discussions on northerly and  southerly turning errors.  

# Northerly Turning Errors  

The center of gravity of the float assembly is located lower  than the pivotal point. As the aircraft turns, the force that  results from the magnetic dip causes the float assembly to  swing in the same direction that the float turns. The result is  a false northerly turn indication. Because of this lead of the  compass card, or float assembly, a northerly turn should be  stopped prior to arrival at the desired heading. This compass  error is amplified with the proximity to either magnetic pole.  One rule of thumb to correct for this leading error is to stop  the turn 15 degrees plus half of the latitude (i.e., if the aircraft  is being operated in a position near 40 degrees latitude, the  turn should be stopped  $15{+}20{=}35$   degrees prior to the desired  heading).  [Figure 8-36A]  

Southerly Turning Errors  

When turning in a southerly direction, the forces are such that  the compass float assembly lags rather than leads. The result  is a false southerly turn indication. The compass card, or float  assembly, should be allowed to pass the desired heading prior  to stopping the turn. As with the northerly error, this error  is amplified with the proximity to either magnetic pole. To  correct this lagging error, the aircraft should be allowed to  pass the desired heading prior to stopping the turn. The same  rule of 15 degrees plus half of the latitude applies here (i.e.,  if the aircraft is being operated in a position near 30 degrees  latitude, the turn should be stopped  $15{+}15{=}30$   degrees after  passing the desired heading).  [Figure 8-36B]  

# Acceleration Error  

The magnetic dip and the forces of inertia cause magnetic  compass errors when accelerating and decelerating on  easterly and westerly headings. Because of the pendulous- type mounting, the aft end of the compass card is tilted  upward when accelerating and downward when decelerating  during changes of airspeed. When accelerating on either  an easterly or westerly heading, the error appears as a  turn indication toward north. When decelerating on either  of these headings, the compass indicates a turn toward  south. A mnemonic, or memory jogger, for the effect of  acceleration error is the word “ANDS” (Acceleration- North/Deceleration-South) may help you to remember the  acceleration error.  [Figure 8-37]  Acceleration causes an

indication toward north; deceleration causes an indication  toward south.  

# Oscillation Error  

Oscillation is a combination of all of the errors previously  mentioned and results in fluctuation of the compass card in  relation to the actual heading direction of the aircraft. When  setting the gyroscopic heading indicator to agree with the  magnetic compass, use the average indication between the  swings.  

# The Vertical Card Magnetic Compass  

The vertical card magnetic compass eliminates some of the  errors and confusion encountered with the magnetic compass.  The dial of this compass is graduated with letters representing  the cardinal directions, numbers every  $30^{\circ}$  , and tick marks  every  $5^{\circ}$  . The dial is rotated by a set of gears from the shaft- mounted magnet, and the nose of the symbolic aircraft on  the instrument glass represents the lubber line for reading the  heading of the aircraft from the dial.  [Figure 8-38]  

# Lags or Leads  

When starting a turn from a northerly heading, the compass  lags behind the turn. When starting a turn from a southerly  heading, the compass leads the turn.  

![](images/753f051970575f8804def5bb359610b3065e369ad41b02bb25b7702f2a8d2abe.jpg)  
Figure 8-38.  Vertical card magnetic compass.  

# Eddy Current Damping  

In the case of a vertical card magnetic compass, flux from  the oscillating permanent magnet produces eddy currents in  a damping disk or cup. The magnetic flux produced by the  eddy currents opposes the flux from the permanent magnet  and decreases the oscillations.  

# Outside Air Temperature (OAT) Gauge  

The outside air temperature (OAT) gauge is a simple and  effective device mounted so that the sensing element is  exposed to the outside air. The sensing element consists  of a bimetallic-type thermometer in which two dissimilar  materials are welded together in a single strip and twisted  into a helix. One end is anchored into protective tube and the  other end is affixed to the pointer, which reads against the  calibration on a circular face. OAT gauges are calibrated in  degrees  $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ,  $^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  , or both. An accurate air temperature provides  the pilot with useful information about temperature lapse rate  with altitude change.  [Figure 8-39]

Flight instruments enable an aircraft to be operated with  maximum performance and enhanced safety, especially when  flying long distances. Manufacturers provide the necessary  flight instruments, but to use them effectively, pilots need  to understand how they operate. As a pilot, it is important to  become very familiar with the operational aspects of the pitot- static system and associated instruments, the vacuum system  and associated instruments, the gyroscopic instruments, and  the magnetic compass.  

# Flight Manuals and  Other Documents  

# Introduction  

Each aircraft comes with documentation and a set of manuals  with which a pilot must be familiar in order to fly that aircraft.  This chapter covers airplane flight manuals (AFM), the  pilot’s operating handbook (POH), and aircraft documents  pertaining to ownership, airworthiness, maintenance, and  operations with inoperative equipment. Knowledge of these  required documents and manuals is essential for a pilot to  conduct a safe flight.  

# Airplane Flight Manuals (AFM)  

Flight manuals and operating handbooks are concise reference  books that provide specific information about a particular  aircraft or subject. They contain basic facts, information,  and/or instructions for the pilot about the operation of an  aircraft, flying techniques, etc., and are intended to be kept  on hand for ready reference.  

The aircraft owner/information manual is a document  developed by the aircraft manufacturer and contains general  information about the make and model of the aircraft.  The manual is not approved by the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) and is not specific to an individual  aircraft. The manual provides general information about the  operation of an aircraft, is not kept current, and cannot be  substituted for the AFM/POH.  

An AFM is a document developed by the aircraft manufacturer  and approved by the FAA. This book contains the information  and instructions required to operate an aircraft safely. A  pilot must comply with this information which is specific  to a particular make and model of aircraft, usually by serial  number. An AFM contains the operating procedures and  limitations of that aircraft. Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 requires that pilots comply  with the operating limitations specified in the approved flight  manuals, markings, and placards.  

Originally, flight manuals followed whatever format and  content the manufacturer felt was appropriate, but this  changed with the acceptance of Specification No. 1 prepared  by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).  Specification No. 1 established a standardized format for all  general aviation airplane and helicopter flight manuals.  

The POH is a document developed by the aircraft  manufacturer and contains FAA-approved AFM information.  If “POH” is used in the main title, a statement must be  included on the title page indicating that sections of the  document are FAA approved as the AFM.  

The POH for most light aircraft built after 1975 is also  designated as the FAA-approved flight manual. The typical  AFM/POH contains the following nine sections: General;  Limitations; Emergency Procedures; Normal Procedures;  Performance; Weight and Balance/Equipment List; Systems  Description; Handling, Service, and Maintenance; and  Supplements. Manufacturers also have the option of including  additional sections, such as one on Safety and Operational  Tips or an alphabetical index at the end of the POH.  

# Preliminary Pages  

While the AFM/POH may appear similar for the same make  and model of aircraft, each manual is unique and contains  specific information about a particular aircraft, such as the  equipment installed and weight and balance information.  Manufacturers are required to include the serial number and  registration on the title page to identify the aircraft to which  the manual belongs. If a manual does not indicate a specific  aircraft registration and serial number, it is limited to general  study purposes only.  

Most manufacturers include a table of contents that identifies  the order of the entire manual by section number and title.  Usually, each section also contains a table of contents for that  section. Page numbers reflect the section and page within that  section (1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 3-1, etc.). If the manual is published  in loose-leaf form, each section is usually marked with a  divider tab indicating the section number, title, or both. The  Emergency Procedures section may have a red tab for quick  identification and reference.  

# General (Section 1)  

The General section provides the basic descriptive  information on the airframe and powerplant(s). Some  manuals include a three-dimensional drawing of the aircraft  that provides dimensions of various components. Included  are such items as wingspan, maximum height, overall length,  wheelbase length, main landing gear track width, diameter  of the rotor system, maximum propeller diameter, propeller  ground clearance, minimum turning radius, and wing area.  This section serves as a quick reference and helps a pilot  become familiar with the aircraft.  

The last segment of the General section contains definitions,  abbreviations, explanations of symbology, and some of  the terminology used in the POH. At the discretion of the  manufacturer, metric and other conversion tables may also  be included.  

# Limitations (Section 2)  

The Limitations section contains only those limitations required  by regulation or that are necessary for the safe operation of  the aircraft, powerplant, systems, and equipment. It includes  operating limitations, instrument markings, color-coding,  and basic placards. Some of the limitation areas are airspeed,  powerplant, weight and loading distribution, and flight.  

# Airspeed  

Airspeed limitations are shown on the airspeed indicator  (ASI) by color coding and on placards or graphs in the  aircraft.  [Figure 9-1]  A red line on the ASI shows the airspeed  limit beyond which structural damage could occur. This is  called the never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  . A yellow arc indicates  the speed range between maximum structural cruising speed   $\mathrm{(V_{N0})}$   and  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  . Operation of an aircraft in the yellow airspeed  arc is for smooth air only and then only with caution. A green  arc depicts the normal operating speed range, with the upper  end at  $\mathrm{V_{N0}}$   and the lower end at stalling speed at maximum  weight with the landing gear and flaps retracted   $(\mathbf{V}_{S1})$  . For  airplanes, the flap operating range is depicted by the white  arc, with the upper end at the maximum flap extended speed   $(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{FE}})$  , and the lower end at the stalling speed with the landing  gear and flaps in the landing configuration   $(\mathbf{V}_{S0})$  .  

![](images/6c864501d6c5010f4275a86463be5a9e6c0b1fc759f0efa7ec637e9d44fea9f2.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.   Single-engine airspeed indicator.  

In addition to the markings listed above, small multi-engine  airplanes have a red radial line to indicate single-engine  minimum controllable airspeed   $\left({{\bf{V}}_{\mathrm{{MC}}}}\right)$  . A blue radial line  is used to indicate single-engine best rate of climb speed at  maximum weight at sea level   $\mathrm{(V_{YSE})}$  ).  [Figure 9-2]  

# Powerplant  

The Powerplant Limitations portion describes operating  limitations on an aircraft’s reciprocating or turbine engine(s).  These include limitations for takeoff power, maximum  continuous power, and maximum normal operating power,  which is the maximum power the engine can produce without  any restrictions and is depicted by a green arc. Other items  that can be included in this area are the minimum and  maximum oil and fuel pressures, oil and fuel grades, and  propeller operating limits.  [Figure 9-3]  

All reciprocating-engine powered aircraft must have a  revolutions per minute (rpm) indicator for each engine.  Aircraft equipped with a constant-speed propeller or rotor  system use a manifold pressure gauge to monitor power  output and a tachometer to monitor propeller or rotor speed.  Both instruments depict the maximum operating limit with  

![](images/6f37b765436e64e02f67c7ab107dc709d3ced4359b1a886f135dd528dda41497.jpg)

a red radial line and the normal operating range with a green  arc.  [Figure 9-4]  Some instruments may have a yellow arc  to indicate a caution area.  

# Weight and Loading Distribution  

Weight and Loading Distribution contains the maximum  certificated weights, as well as the center of gravity (CG)  range. The location of the reference datum used in balance  computations is included in this section. Weight and balance  computations are not provided in this area, but rather in the  weight and balance section of the AFM/POH.  

![](images/25ab6ec2f2ed5dc87d25cfec7b6693616fb7953028ebba9343113831a7d334c6.jpg)  

Figure 9-4.   Manifold pressure gauge (top) and tachometer (bottom).  

# Flight Limits  

Flight Limits list authorized maneuvers with appropriate  entry speeds, flight load factor limits, and types of operation  limits. It also indicates those maneuvers that are prohibited,  such as spins or acrobatic flight, as well as operational  limitations such as flight into known icing conditions.  

# Placards  

Most aircraft display one or more placards that contain  information having a direct bearing on the safe operation of  the aircraft. These placards are located in conspicuous places  and are reproduced in the Limitations section or as directed by  an Airworthiness Directive (AD).  [Figure 9-5]  Airworthiness  Directives are explained in detail later in this chapter.  

# Emergency Procedures (Section 3)  

Checklists describing the recommended procedures and  airspeeds for coping with various types of emergencies or  critical situations are located in the Emergency Procedures  section. Some of the emergencies covered include:  engine failure, fire, and system failure. The procedures  for inflight engine restarting and ditching may also be  included. Manufacturers may first show an emergency  checklist in an abbreviated form with the order of items  reflecting the sequence of action. Amplified checklists that  provide additional information on the procedures follow  the abbreviated checklist. To be prepared for emergency  situations, memorize the immediate action items and, after  completion, refer to the appropriate checklist.  

![](images/a6b153191ebaacc3cc283fb701fef2228638ed977614801f1fc87edb71096a26.jpg)  
Figure 9-5.   Placards are used to depict aircraft limitations.  

Manufacturers may include an optional subsection  entitled Abnormal Procedures. This subsection describes  recommended procedures for handling malfunctions that are  not considered emergencies.  

# Normal Procedures (Section 4)  

This section begins with a list of the airspeeds for normal  operations. The next area consists of several checklists that  may include preflight inspection, before starting procedures,  starting engine, before taxiing, taxiing, before takeoff, climb,  cruise, descent, before landing, balked landing, after landing,  and post flight procedures. An Amplified Procedures area  follows the checklists to provide more detailed information  about the various previously mentioned procedures.  

To avoid missing important steps, always use the appropriate  checklists when available. Consistent adherence to approved  checklists is a sign of a disciplined and competent pilot.  

# Performance (Section 5)  

The Performance section contains all the information required  by the aircraft certification regulations and any additional  performance information the manufacturer deems important  to pilot ability to safely operate the aircraft. Performance  charts, tables, and graphs vary in style, but all contain the  same basic information. Examples of the performance  information found in most flight manuals include a graph or  table for converting calibrated airspeed to true airspeed; stall  speeds in various configurations; and data for determining  takeoff and climb performance, cruise performance, and  landing performance.  Figure 9-6  is an example of a typical  performance graph. For more information on use of the  charts, graphs, and tables, refer to Chapter 10, Aircraft  Performance.  

# Weight and Balance/Equipment List (Section 6)  

The Weight and Balance/Equipment List section contains  all the information required by the FAA to calculate the  weight and balance of an aircraft. Manufacturers include  sample weight and balance problems. Weight and balance is  discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10, Weight and Balance.  

# Systems Description (Section 7)  

This section describes the aircraft systems in a manner  appropriate to the pilot most likely to operate the aircraft.  For example, a manufacturer might assume an experienced  pilot will be reading the information for an advanced aircraft.  For more information on aircraft systems, refer to Chapter  7, Aircraft Systems.  

![](images/dcda3c3fe7ed680e2f4087f626447280e34e69c91f07d2d58485efa06b4b2256.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.   Stall speed chart.  

# Handling, Service, and Maintenance (Section 8)  

The Handling, Service, and Maintenance section describes  the maintenance and inspections recommended by the  manufacturer (and the regulations). Additional maintenance  or inspections may be required by the issuance of ADs  applicable to the airframe, engine, propeller, or components. This section also describes preventive maintenance that  may be accomplished by certificated pilots, as well as the  manufacturer’s recommended ground handling procedures. It  includes considerations for hangaring, tie-down, and general  storage procedures for the aircraft.  

# Supplements (Section 9)  

The Supplements section contains information necessary  to safely and efficiently operate the aircraft when equipped  with optional systems and equipment (not provided with the  standard aircraft). Some of this information may be supplied  by the aircraft manufacturer or by the manufacturer of the  optional equipment. The appropriate information is inserted  into the flight manual at the time the equipment is installed.  Autopilots, navigation systems, and air-conditioning  systems are examples of equipment described in this section.  [Figure 9-7]  

![](images/cef32a74c71ce26ee8a209666af3675e608e8a1a98354b8316c02d760a848b21.jpg)  
Figure 9-7.   Supplements provide information on optional equipment.  

# Safety Tips (Section 10)  

The Safety Tips section is an optional section containing a  review of information that enhances the safe operation of the  aircraft. For example, physiological factors, general weather  information, fuel conservation procedures, high altitude  operations, or cold weather operations might be discussed.  

# Aircraft Documents  

# Certificate of Aircraft Registration  

Before an aircraft can be flown legally, it must be registered  with the FAA Aircraft Registry. The Certificate of Aircraft  Registration, which is issued to the owner as evidence of  the registration, must be carried in the aircraft at all times.  [Figure 9-8]  

The Certificate of Aircraft Registration cannot be used for  operations when:  

•	 The aircraft is registered under the laws of a foreign  country  

•	 The aircraft’s registration is canceled upon written  request of the certificate holder •	 The aircraft is totally destroyed or scrapped •	 The ownership of the aircraft is transferred •	 The certificate holder loses United States citizenship  

For additional information, see 14 CFR part 47, section 47.41.  When one of the events listed in 14 CFR part 47, section  47.41 occurs, the previous owner must notify the FAA by  filling in the back of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration,  and mailing it to:  

FAA Aircraft Registration Branch, AFS-750 P.O. Box 25504 Oklahoma City, OK 73125-0504  

A dealer’s aircraft registration certificate is another form of  registration certificate, but is valid only for required flight  tests by the manufacturer or in flights that are necessary for  

![](images/58d929cf41e6756bf6514e03265e30d81d2db8faa10b390b07e7cf09fda9c5a8.jpg)  
Figure 9-8.   AC Form 8050-3, Certificate of Aircraft Registration.  

the sale of the aircraft by the manufacturer or a dealer. The  dealer must remove the certificate when the aircraft is sold.  

Upon complying with 14 CFR part 47, section 47.31, the  pink copy of the application for an Aircraft Registration  Application, Aeronautical Center (AC) Form 8050-1,  provides authorization to operate an unregistered aircraft  for a period not to exceed 90 days. Since the aircraft is  unregistered, it cannot be operated outside of the United  States until a permanent Certificate of Aircraft Registration  is received and placed in the aircraft.  

The FAA does not issue any certificate of ownership or  endorse any information with respect to ownership on a  Certificate of Aircraft Registration.  

NOTE: For additional information concerning the Aircraft  Registration Application or the Aircraft Bill of Sale, contact  the nearest FAA Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  

# Airworthiness Certificate  

An Airworthiness Certificate is issued by a representative of  the FAA after the aircraft has been inspected, is found to meet  the requirements of 14 CFR part 21, and is in condition for safe  operation. The Airworthiness Certificate must be displayed in  the aircraft so it is legible to the passengers and crew whenever  it is operated. The Airworthiness Certificate must remain with  the aircraft unless it is sold to a foreign purchaser.  

A Standard Airworthiness Certificate is issued for aircraft  type certificated in the normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter,  transport categories, and manned free balloons.  Figure 9-9 illustrates a Standard Airworthiness Certificate, and an  explanation of each item in the certificate follows.  

1. 	  Nationality and Registration Marks.  The “N”  indicates the aircraft is registered in the United States.  Registration marks consist of a series of up to five  numbers or numbers and letters. In this case, N2631A  is the registration number assigned to this aircraft.  

2.	 Manufacturer and Model . Indicates the manufacturer,  make, and model of the aircraft.  

3.	 Aircraft Serial Number . Indicates the manufacturer’s  serial number assigned to the aircraft, as noted on the  aircraft data plate.  

4.	 Category . Indicates the category in which the aircraft  must be operated. In this case, it must be operated  in accordance with the limitations specified for the  “NORMAL” category.  

5.	 Authority and Basis for Issuance . Indicates the aircraft  conforms to its type certificate and is considered in  condition for safe operation at the time of inspection  and issuance of the certificate. Any exemptions from  the applicable airworthiness standards are briefly  noted here and the exemption number given. The word  “NONE” is entered if no exemption exists.  

![](images/512c4eba0037365dbfd47f5f2432ff54a9884628a26a1dcc6de4f702a92af23d.jpg)  

6.	 Terms and Conditions . Indicates the Airworthiness  Certificate is in effect indefinitely if the aircraft is  maintained in accordance with 14 CFR parts 21, 43, and  91, and the aircraft is registered in the United States.  

Also included are the date the certificate was issued and the  signature and office identification of the FAA representative.  

A Standard Airworthiness Certificate remains in effect  if the aircraft receives the required maintenance and is  properly registered in the United States. Flight safety relies  in part on the condition of the aircraft, which is determined  by inspections performed by mechanics, approved repair  stations, or manufacturers that meet specific requirements  of 14 CFR part 43.  

A Special Airworthiness Certificate is issued for all aircraft  certificated in other than the Standard classifications, such  as Experimental, Restricted, Limited, Provisional, and  Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA). LSA receive a pink special  airworthiness certificate; however, there are exceptions.  For example, the Piper Cub is in the LSA category, but it  was certificated as a normal aircraft during its manufacture.  When purchasing an aircraft classified as other than Standard,  it is recommended that the local FSDO be contacted for an  explanation of the pertinent airworthiness requirements and  the limitations of such a certificate.  

# Aircraft Maintenance  

Maintenance is defined as the preservation, inspection,  overhaul, and repair of an aircraft, including the replacement  of parts. Regular and proper maintenance ensures that  an aircraft meets an acceptable standard of airworthiness  throughout its operational life.  

Although maintenance requirements vary for different  types of aircraft, experience shows that aircraft need some  type of preventive maintenance every 25 hours of flying  time or less and minor maintenance at least every 100  hours. This is influenced by the kind of operation, climatic  conditions, storage facilities, age, and construction of the  aircraft. Manufacturers supply maintenance manuals, parts  catalogs, and other service information that should be used  in maintaining the aircraft.  

# Aircraft Inspections  

Under 14 CFR part 91, the primary responsibility for  maintaining an aircraft in an airworthy condition falls on the  owner or operator of the aircraft. Certain inspections must be  performed on the aircraft, and the owner must maintain the  airworthiness of the aircraft during the time between required  inspections by having any defects corrected.  

Under   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$  , part 91, subpart E, all civil aircraft are  required to be inspected at specific intervals to determine  the overall condition. The interval depends upon the type  of operations in which the aircraft is engaged. All aircraft  need to be inspected at least once every 12 calendar months,  while inspection is required for others after every 100 hours  of operation. Some aircraft are inspected in accordance with  an inspection system set up to provide for total inspection  of the aircraft on the basis of calendar time, time in service,  number of system operations, or any combination of these.  

All inspections should follow the current manufacturer’s  maintenance manual, including the Instructions for  Continued Airworthiness concerning inspection intervals,  parts replacement, and life-limited items as applicable to  the aircraft.  

# Annual Inspection  

Any reciprocating engine or single-engine turbojet/ turbopropeller-powered small aircraft (weighing 12,500  pounds or less) flown for business or pleasure and not  flown for compensation or hire is required to be inspected  at least annually. The inspection shall be performed by a  certificated airframe and powerplant (A&P) mechanic who  holds an inspection authorization (IA) by the manufacturer  of the aircraft or by a certificated and appropriately rated  repair station. The aircraft may not be operated unless the  annual inspection has been performed within the preceding  12 calendar months. A period of 12 calendar months extends  from any day of a month to the last day of the same month the  following year. An aircraft overdue for an annual inspection  may be operated under a Special Flight Permit issued by  the FAA for the purpose of flying the aircraft to a location  where the annual inspection can be performed. However, all  applicable ADs that are due must be complied with before  the flight.  

# 100-Hour Inspection  

All aircraft under 12,500 pounds (except turbojet/ turbopropeller-powered multi-engine airplanes and turbine  powered rotorcraft), used to carry passengers for hire, must  receive a 100-hour inspection within the preceding 100 hours  of time in service and must be approved for return to service.  Additionally, an aircraft used for flight instruction for hire,  when provided by the person giving the flight instruction,  must also have received a 100-hour inspection. This inspection  must be performed by an FAA-certificated A&P mechanic,  an appropriately rated FAA-certificated repair station, or  by the aircraft manufacturer. An annual inspection, or an  inspection for the issuance of an Airworthiness Certificate,  may be substituted for a required 100-hour inspection. The  100-hour limitation may be exceeded by no more than 10  hours for the purpose of traveling to a location at which the  required inspection can be performed. Any excess time used  for this purpose must be included in computing the next 100  hours of time in service.  

# Other Inspection Programs  

The annual and 100-hour inspection requirements do not  apply to large (over 12,500 pounds) airplanes, turbojets, or  turbopropeller-powered multi-engine airplanes or to aircraft  for which the owner complies with a progressive inspection  program. Details of these requirements may be determined  by referencing 14 CFR, part 43, section 43.11 and 14 CFR  part 91, subpart E, or by inquiring at a local FSDO.  

# Altimeter System Inspection  

Under 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.411, requires that the  altimeter, encoding altimeter, and related system must be  tested and inspected within the 24 months prior to operating in  controlled airspace under instrument flight rules (IFR). This  applies to all aircraft being operated in controlled airspace.  

# Transponder Inspection  

Title 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.413, requires that before  a transponder can be used under 14 CFR, part 91, section  91.215(a), it shall be tested and inspected within the 24  months prior to operation of the aircraft regardless of airspace  restrictions.  

# Emergency Locator Transmitter  

An emergency locator transmitter (ELT) is required by 14  CFR, part 91, section 91.207, and must be inspected within  12 calendar months after the last inspection for the following:  

•	 Proper installation •	 Battery corrosion •	 Operation of the controls and crash sensor •	 The presence of a sufficient signal radiated from its  antenna  

The ELT must be attached to the airplane in such a manner  that the probability of damage to the transmitter in the event  of crash impact is minimized. Fixed and deployable automatic  type transmitters must be attached to the airplane as far aft  as practicable. Batteries used in the ELTs must be replaced  (or recharged, if the batteries are rechargeable):  

•	 When the transmitter has been in use for more than 1  cumulative hour •	 When 50 percent of the battery useful life or, for  rechargeable batteries, 50 percent of useful life of the  charge has expired  

An expiration date for replacing (or recharging) the battery  must be legibly marked on the outside of the transmitter  and entered in the aircraft maintenance record. This does  not apply to batteries that are essentially unaffected during  storage intervals, such as water-activated batteries.  

# Preflight Inspections  

The preflight inspection is a thorough and systematic means  by which a pilot determines if an aircraft is airworthy and in  condition for safe operation. POHs and owner/information  manuals contain a section devoted to a systematic method  of performing a preflight inspection.  

# Minimum Equipment Lists (MEL) and  Operations With Inoperative Equipment  

Under 14 CFR, all aircraft instruments and installed equipment  are required to be operative prior to each departure. When the  FAA adopted the minimum equipment list (MEL) concept for  14 CFR part 91 operations, it allowed aircraft to be operated  with inoperative equipment determined to be nonessential for  safe flight. At the same time, it allowed part 91 operators,  without an MEL, to defer repairs on nonessential equipment  within the guidelines of part 91.  

The FAA has two acceptable methods of deferring  maintenance on small rotorcraft, non-turbine powered  airplanes, gliders, or lighter-than-air aircraft operated under  part 91. They are the deferral provision of 14 CFR, part 91,  section 91.213(d) and an FAA-approved MEL.  

The deferral provision of 14 CFR, part 91, section 91.213(d)  is widely used by most pilot/operators. Its popularity is due  to simplicity and minimal paperwork. When inoperative  equipment is found during a preflight inspection or prior to  departure, the decision should be to cancel the flight, obtain  maintenance prior to flight, or to defer the item or equipment.  

Maintenance deferrals are not used for inflight discrepancies.  The manufacturer’s AFM/POH procedures are to be used in  those situations. The discussion that follows assumes that  the pilot wishes to defer maintenance that would ordinarily  be required prior to flight.  

Using the deferral provision of 14 CFR, part 91, section  91.213(d), the pilot determines whether the inoperative  equipment is required by type design, 14 CFR, or ADs. If  the inoperative item is not required, and the aircraft can be  safely operated without it, the deferral may be made. The  inoperative item shall be deactivated or removed and an  INOPERATIVE placard placed near the appropriate switch,  control, or indicator. If deactivation or removal involves  maintenance (removal always will), it must be accomplished  by certificated maintenance personnel and recorded in  accordance with 14 CFR part 43.  

For example, if the position lights (installed equipment)  were discovered to be inoperative prior to a daytime flight,  the pilot would follow the requirements of 14 CFR, part 91,  section 91.213(d).  

The deactivation may be a process as simple as the pilot  positioning a circuit breaker to the OFF position or as  complex as rendering instruments or equipment totally  inoperable. Complex maintenance tasks require a certificated  and appropriately rated maintenance person to perform the  deactivation. In all cases, the item or equipment must be  placarded INOPERATIVE.  

All small rotorcraft, non-turbine powered airplanes, gliders,  or lighter-than-air aircraft operated under 14 CFR part 91  are eligible to use the maintenance deferral provisions of 14  CFR, part 91, section 91.213(d). However, once an operator  requests an MEL, and a Letter of Authorization (LOA)  is issued by the FAA, then the use of the MEL becomes  mandatory for that aircraft. All maintenance deferrals must  be accomplished in accordance with the terms and conditions  of the MEL and the operator-generated procedures document.  

The use of an MEL for an aircraft operated under 14  CFR part 91 also allows for the deferral of inoperative  items or equipment. The primary guidance becomes the  FAA-approved MEL issued to that specific operator and  N-numbered aircraft.  

The FAA has developed master minimum equipment lists  (MMELs) for aircraft in current use. Upon written request by  an operator, the local FSDO may issue the appropriate make  and model MMEL, along with an LOA, and the preamble.  The operator then develops operations and maintenance  (O&M) procedures from the MMEL. This MMEL with O&M  procedures now becomes the operator’s MEL. The MEL,  LOA, preamble, and procedures document developed by the  operator must be on board the aircraft during each operation.  The FAA considers an approved MEL to be a supplemental  type certificate (STC) issued to an aircraft by serial number  and registration number. It, therefore, becomes the authority  to operate that aircraft in a condition other than originally  type certificated.  

With an approved MEL, if the position lights were discovered  inoperative prior to a daytime flight, the pilot would make  an entry in the maintenance record or discrepancy record  provided for that purpose. The item would then either be  repaired or deferred in accordance with the MEL. Upon  confirming that daytime flight with inoperative position  lights is acceptable in accordance with the provisions of the  MEL, the pilot would leave the position lights switch OFF,  open the circuit breaker (or whatever action is called for in  the procedures document), and placard the position light  switch as INOPERATIVE.  

There are exceptions to the use of the MEL for deferral. For  example, should a component fail that is not listed in the MEL  as deferrable (the tachometer, flaps, or stall warning device,  for example), then repairs are required to be performed prior  to departure. If maintenance or parts are not readily available  at that location, a special flight permit can be obtained from  the nearest FSDO. This permit allows the aircraft to be  flown to another location for maintenance. This allows an  aircraft that may not currently meet applicable airworthiness  requirements, but is capable of safe flight, to be operated  under the restrictive special terms and conditions attached  to the special flight permit.  

Deferral of maintenance is not to be taken lightly, and due  consideration should be given to the effect an inoperative  component may have on the operation of an aircraft,  particularly if other items are inoperative. Further information  regarding MELs and operations with inoperative equipment  can be found in AC 91-67, Minimum Equipment Requirements  for General Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91.  

# Preventive Maintenance  

Preventive maintenance is regarded as simple or minor  preservation operations and the replacement of small standard  parts, not involving complex assembly operations. Allowed  items of preventative maintenance are listed and limited to  the items of 14 CFR part 43, appendix A(c).  

# Maintenance Entries  

All pilots who perform preventive maintenance must make  an entry in the maintenance record of the aircraft. The entry  must include the following information:  

1. 	 A description of the work, such as “changed oil (Shell  Aero-50) at 2,345 hours” 2. 	 The date of completion of the work performed 3. 	 The pilot’s name, signature, certificate number, and  type of certificate held  

# Examples of Preventive Maintenance  

The following examples of preventive maintenance are taken  from 14 CFR, part 43, Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance,  Rebuilding, and Alternation, which should be consulted for a  more in-depth look at the preventive maintenance a pilot can  perform on an aircraft. Remember, preventive maintenance  is limited to work that does not involve complex assembly  operations including the following:  

•	 Removal, installation, and repair of landing gear  tires and shock cords; servicing landing gear shock  struts by adding oil, air, or both; servicing gear wheel  bearings; replacing defective safety wiring or cotter  keys; lubrication not requiring disassembly other than  removal of nonstructural items, such as cover plates,  cowlings, and fairings; making simple fabric patches  not requiring rib stitching or the removal of structural  parts or control surfaces. In the case of balloons,  the making of small fabric repairs to envelopes  (as defined in, and in accordance with, the balloon  manufacturer’s instructions) not requiring load tape  repair or replacement.  

•	 Replenishing hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic  reservoir; refinishing decorative coating of fuselage,  balloon baskets, wings, tail group surfaces (excluding  balanced control surfaces), fairings, cowlings,  landing gear, cabin, or flight deck interior when  removal or disassembly of any primary structure  or operating system is not required; applying  preservative or protective material to components  where no disassembly of any primary structure or  operating system is involved and where such coating  is not prohibited or is not contrary to good practices;  repairing upholstery and decorative furnishings of the  cabin, flight deck, or balloon basket interior when the  repair does not require disassembly of any primary  structure or operating system or interfere with an  operating system or affect the primary structure of  the aircraft; making small, simple repairs to fairings,  nonstructural cover plates, cowlings, and small  patches and reinforcements not changing the contour  to interfere with proper air flow; replacing side  windows where that work does not interfere with the  structure or any operating system, such as controls,  electrical equipment, etc.  •	 Replacing safety belts, seats or seat parts with  replacement parts approved for the aircraft, not  involving disassembly of any primary structure or  operating system, bulbs, reflectors, and lenses of  position and landing lights. •	 Replacing wheels and skis where no weight-and- balance computation is involved; replacing any  cowling not requiring removal of the propeller or  disconnection of flight controls; replacing or cleaning  spark plugs and setting of spark plug gap clearance;  replacing any hose connection, except hydraulic  connections; however, prefabricated fuel lines may  be replaced.  

elements; servicing batteries, cleaning balloon burner  pilot and main nozzles in accordance with the balloon  manufacturer’s instructions.

 •	 The interchange of balloon baskets and burners on  envelopes when the basket or burner is designated as  interchangeable in the balloon type certificate data  and the baskets and burners are specifically designed  for quick removal and installation; adjustment  of nonstructural standard fasteners incidental to  operations.

 •	 The installations of anti-misfueling devices to reduce  the diameter of fuel tank filler openings only if the  specific device has been made a part of the aircraft type  certificate data by the aircraft manufacturer, the aircraft  manufacturer has provided FAA-approved instructions  for installation of the specific device, and installation  does not involve the disassembly of the existing tank  filler opening; troubleshooting and repairing broken  circuits in landing light wiring circuits. 

 • 	 Removing and replacing self-contained, front  instrument panel-mounted navigation and  communication devices that employ tray-mounted  connectors which connect the unit when the unit  is installed into the instrument panel (excluding  automatic flight control systems, transponders, and  microwave frequency distance measuring equipment  (DME)). The approved unit must be designed to be  readily and repeatedly removed and replaced, and  pertinent instructions must be provided. Prior to the  unit’s intended use, an operational check must be  performed in accordance with the applicable sections  of 14 CFR part 91 on checking, removing, and  replacing magnetic chip detectors.

 •	 Inspection and maintenance tasks prescribed and  specifically identified as preventive maintenance in  a primary category aircraft type certificate or STC  holder’s approved special inspection and preventive  maintenance program when accomplished on a  primary category aircraft.

 •	 Updating self-contained, front instrument panel- mounted air traffic control (ATC) navigational  software databases (excluding those of automatic  flight control systems, transponders, and microwave  frequency DME), only if no disassembly of the unit is  required and pertinent instructions are provided; prior  to the unit’s intended use, an operational check must  be performed in accordance with applicable sections  of 14 CFR part 91.  

Certificated pilots, excluding student pilots, sport pilots, and  recreational pilots, may perform preventive maintenance on  any aircraft that is owned or operated by them provided that  the aircraft is not used in air carrier service and does not  qualify under 14 CFR parts 121, 129, or 135. A pilot holding  a sport pilot certificate may perform preventive maintenance  on an aircraft owned or operated by that pilot if that aircraft is  issued a special airworthiness certificate in the LSA category.  (Sport pilots operating LSA should refer to 14 CFR part 65  for maintenance privileges.) 14 CFR part 43, appendix A,  contains a list of the operations that are considered to be  preventive maintenance.  

# Repairs and Alterations  

Repairs and alterations are classified as either major or minor.  14 CFR part 43, appendix A, describes the alterations and  repairs considered major. Major repairs or alterations shall  be approved for return to service on FAA Form 337, Major  Repair and Alteration, by an appropriately rated certificated  repair station, an FAA-certificated A&P mechanic holding an  IA, or a representative of the Administrator. Minor repairs and  minor alterations may be approved for return to service with a  proper entry in the maintenance records by an FAA-certificated  A&P mechanic or an appropriately certificated repair station.  

For modifications of experimental aircraft, refer to the  operating limitations issued to that aircraft. Modifications  in accordance with FAA Order 8130.2, Airworthiness  Certification of Aircraft and Related Products, may require  the notification of the issuing authority.  

# Special Flight Permits  

A special flight permit is a Special Airworthiness Certificate  authorizing operation of an aircraft that does not currently  meet applicable airworthiness requirements but is safe  for a specific flight. Before the permit is issued, an FAA  inspector may personally inspect the aircraft or require it to  be inspected by an FAA-certificated A&P mechanic or an  appropriately certificated repair station to determine its safety  for the intended flight. The inspection shall be recorded in  the aircraft records.  

The special flight permit is issued to allow the aircraft to be  flown to a base where repairs, alterations, or maintenance  can be performed; for delivering or exporting the aircraft; or  for evacuating an aircraft from an area of impending danger.  A special flight permit may be issued to allow the operation  of an overweight aircraft for flight beyond its normal range  over water or land areas where adequate landing facilities  or fuel is not available.  

If a special flight permit is needed, assistance and the  necessary forms may be obtained from the local FSDO  or Designated Airworthiness Representative (DAR).  [Figure 9-10]  

# Airworthiness Directives (ADs)  

A primary safety function of the FAA is to require correction  of unsafe conditions found in an aircraft, aircraft engine,  propeller, or appliance when such conditions exist and are  likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.  The unsafe condition may exist because of a design defect,  maintenance, or other causes. Airworthiness Directives  (ADs), under 14 CFR, part 39, define the authority and  responsibility of the Administrator for requiring the necessary  corrective action. ADs are used to notify aircraft owners and  other interested persons of unsafe conditions and to specify  the conditions under which the product may continue to be  operated. ADs are divided into two categories:  

1.	 Those of an emergency nature requiring immediate  compliance prior to further flight 2.	 Those of a less urgent nature requiring compliance  within a specified period of time  

ADs are regulatory and shall be complied with unless a  specific exemption is granted. It is the responsibility of the  aircraft owner or operator to ensure compliance with all  pertinent ADs, including those ADs that require recurrent  or continuing action. For example, an AD may require a  repetitive inspection each 50 hours of operation, meaning  the particular inspection shall be accomplished and recorded  every 50 hours of time in service. Owners/operators are  reminded that there is no provision to overfly the maximum  hour requirement of an AD unless it is specifically written  into the AD. To help determine if an AD applies to an  amateur-built aircraft, contact the local FSDO.  

14 CFR, part 91, section 91.417 requires a record to be  maintained that shows the current status of applicable  ADs, including the method of compliance; the AD number  and revision date, if recurring; next due date and time; the  signature; type of certificate; and certificate number of the  repair station or mechanic who performed the work. For ready  reference, many aircraft owners have a chronological listing  of the pertinent ADs in the back of their aircraft, engine, and  propeller maintenance records.  

All ADs and the AD Biweekly are free on the Internet  at http://rgl.faa.gov and are available through e-mail.  Individuals can enroll for the e-mail service at the website  above. Paper copies of the Summary of Airworthiness  Directives and the AD Biweekly may be purchased from  the Superintendent of Documents. The Summary contains  all the valid ADs previously published and is divided into

# Aircraft Owner/Operator Responsibilities  

The registered owner/operator of an aircraft is responsible for:  

•	 Having a current Airworthiness Certificate and a  Certificate of Aircraft Registration in the aircraft. •	 Maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition,  including compliance with all applicable ADs and  assuring that maintenance is properly recorded. •	 Keeping abreast of current regulations concerning the  operation and maintenance of the aircraft. •	 Notifying the FAA Aircraft Registry immediately of  any change of permanent mailing address, of the sale  or export of the aircraft, or of the loss of the eligibility  to register an aircraft. (Refer to 14 CFR, part 47,  section 47.41.)  

•	 Having a current Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) radio station license if equipped with radios,  including emergency locator transmitter (ELT), if  operated outside of the United States.  

# Chapter Summary  

Knowledge of an aircraft’s AFM/POH and documents,  such as ADs, provide pilots with ready access to pertinent  information needed to safely fly a particular aircraft. By  understanding the operations, limitations, and performance  characteristics of the aircraft, the pilot can make educated  flight decisions. By learning what preventive maintenance  is allowed on the aircraft, a pilot can maintain his or her  aircraft in an airworthy condition. The goal of every pilot is  a safe flight. Flight manuals and aircraft documentation are  essential tools used to reach that goal.  

Chapter 10  

# Weight and Balance  

# Introduction  

Compliance with the weight and balance limits of any aircraft  is critical to flight safety. Operating above the maximum  weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of  an aircraft and adversely affects its performance. Operation  with the center of gravity (CG) outside the approved limits  results in control difficulty.  

# Weight Control  

As discussed in Chapter 5, Aerodynamics of Flight, weight  is the force with which gravity attracts a body toward the  center of the Earth. It is a product of the mass of a body and  the acceleration acting on the body. Weight is a major factor  in aircraft construction and operation and demands respect  from all pilots.  

The force of gravity continuously attempts to pull an aircraft  down toward Earth. The force of lift is the only force that  counteracts weight and sustains an aircraft in flight. The  amount of lift produced by an airfoil is limited by the airfoil  design, angle of attack (AOA), airspeed, and air density. To  assure that the lift generated is sufficient to counteract weight,  loading an aircraft beyond the manufacturer’s recommended  weight must be avoided. If the weight is greater than the lift  generated, the aircraft may be incapable of flight.  

# Effects of Weight  

Any item aboard an aircraft that increases the total weight is  undesirable for performance. Manufacturers attempt to make  an aircraft as light as possible without sacrificing strength  or safety.  

The pilot should always be aware of the consequences of  overloading. An overloaded aircraft may not be able to leave  the ground, or if it does become airborne, it may exhibit  unexpected and unusually poor flight characteristics. If not  properly loaded, the initial indication of poor performance  usually takes place during takeoff.  

Excessive weight reduces the flight performance in almost  every respect. For example, the most important performance  deficiencies of an overloaded aircraft are:  

• 	 Higher takeoff speed • 	 Longer takeoff run • 	 Reduced rate and angle of climb • 	 Lower maximum altitude • 	 Shorter range • 	 Reduced cruising speed • 	 Reduced maneuverability • 	 Higher stalling speed • 	 Higher approach and landing speed • 	 Longer landing roll • 	 Excessive weight on the nose wheel or tail wheel  

The pilot must be knowledgeable about the effect of weight  on the performance of the particular aircraft being flown.  Preflight planning should include a check of performance  charts to determine if the aircraft’s weight may contribute  to hazardous flight operations. Excessive weight in itself  reduces the safety margins available to the pilot and becomes  even more hazardous when other performance-reducing  factors are combined with excess weight. The pilot must  also consider the consequences of an overweight aircraft if  an emergency condition arises. If an engine fails on takeoff  or airframe ice forms at low altitude, it is usually too late to  reduce an aircraft’s weight to keep it in the air.  

# Weight Changes  

The operating weight of an aircraft can be changed by  simply altering the fuel load. Gasoline has considerable  weight—6 pounds per gallon. Thirty gallons of fuel may  weigh more than one passenger. If a pilot lowers airplane  weight by reducing fuel, the resulting decrease in the range  of the airplane must be taken into consideration during flight  planning. During flight, fuel burn is normally the only weight  change that takes place. As fuel is used, an aircraft becomes  lighter and performance is improved.  

Changes of fixed equipment have a major effect upon the  weight of an aircraft. The installation of extra radios or  instruments, as well as repairs or modifications, may also  affect the weight of an aircraft.  

# Balance, Stability, and Center of Gravity  

Balance refers to the location of the CG of an aircraft, and is  important to stability and safety in flight. The CG is a point  at which the aircraft would balance if it were suspended at  that point.  

The primary concern in balancing an aircraft is the fore  and aft location of the CG along the longitudinal axis. The  CG is not necessarily a fixed point; its location depends on  the distribution of weight in the aircraft. As variable load  items are shifted or expended, there is a resultant shift in  CG location. The distance between the forward and back  limits for the position of the center for gravity or CG range  is certified for an aircraft by the manufacturer. The pilot  should realize that if the CG is displaced too far forward  on the longitudinal axis, a nose-heavy condition will  result. Conversely, if the CG is displaced too far aft on the  longitudinal axis, a tail heavy condition results. It is possible  that the pilot could not control the aircraft if the CG location  produced an unstable condition.  [Figure 10-1]  

Location of the CG with reference to the lateral axis is also  important. For each item of weight existing to the left of  

![](images/fd21427c5fb391207af560b301ea035cc24f3260be041e23bf5bae399e7e1589.jpg)  
Figure 10-1.  Lateral and longitudinal unbalance.  

the fuselage centerline, there is an equal weight existing at  a corresponding location on the right. This may be upset  by unbalanced lateral loading. The position of the lateral  CG is not computed in all aircraft, but the pilot must be  aware that adverse effects arise as a result of a laterally  unbalanced condition. In an airplane, lateral unbalance occurs  if the fuel load is mismanaged by supplying the engine(s)  unevenly from tanks on one side of the airplane. The pilot  can compensate for the resulting wing-heavy condition by  adjusting the trim or by holding a constant control pressure.  This action places the aircraft controls in an out-of-streamline  condition, increases drag, and results in decreased operating  efficiency. Since lateral balance is addressed when needed in  the aircraft flight manual (AFM) and longitudinal balance is  more critical, further reference to balance in this handbook  means longitudinal location of the CG.  

Flying an aircraft that is out of balance can produce increased  pilot fatigue with obvious effects on the safety and efficiency  of flight. The pilot’s natural correction for longitudinal  unbalance is a change of trim to remove the excessive control  pressure. Excessive trim, however, has the effect of reducing  not only aerodynamic efficiency but also primary control  travel distance in the direction the trim is applied.  

# Effects of Adverse Balance  

Adverse balance conditions affect flight characteristics in  much the same manner as those mentioned for an excess  weight condition. It is vital to comply with weight and  balance limits established for all aircraft. Operating above  the maximum weight limitation compromises the structural  integrity of the aircraft and can adversely affect performance.  Stability and control are also affected by improper balance.  

# Stability  

Loading in a nose-heavy condition causes problems in  controlling and raising the nose, especially during takeoff  and landing. Loading in a tail heavy condition has a serious  effect upon longitudinal stability, and reduces the capability  to recover from stalls and spins. Tail heavy loading also  produces very light control forces, another undesirable  characteristic. This makes it easy for the pilot to inadvertently  overstress an aircraft.  

# Stability and Center of Gravity  

Limits for the location of the CG are established by the  manufacturer. These are the fore and aft limits beyond  which the CG should not be located for flight. These limits  are published for each aircraft in the Type Certificate Data  Sheet (TCDS), or aircraft specification and the AFM or  pilot’s operating handbook (POH). If the CG is not within the  allowable limits after loading, it will be necessary to relocate  some items before flight is attempted.  

The forward CG limit is often established at a location that  is determined by the landing characteristics of an aircraft.  During landing, one of the most critical phases of flight,  exceeding the forward CG limit may result in excessive loads  on the nosewheel, a tendency to nose over on tailwheel type  airplanes, decreased performance, higher stalling speeds, and  higher control forces.  

# Control  

In extreme cases, a CG location that is beyond the forward  limit may result in nose heaviness, making it difficult or  impossible to flare for landing. Manufacturers purposely  place the forward CG limit as far rearward as possible to  aid pilots in avoiding damage when landing. In addition to  decreased static and dynamic longitudinal stability, other  undesirable effects caused by a CG location aft of the  allowable range may include extreme control difficulty,  violent stall characteristics, and very light control forces  which make it easy to overstress an aircraft inadvertently.  

A restricted forward CG limit is also specified to assure  that sufficient elevator/control deflection is available at  minimum airspeed. When structural limitations do not limit  the forward CG position, it is located at the position where  full-up elevator/control deflection is required to obtain a high  AOA for landing.  

The aft CG limit is the most rearward position at which the  CG can be located for the most critical maneuver or operation.  As the CG moves aft, a less stable condition occurs, which  decreases the ability of the aircraft to right itself after  maneuvering or turbulence.  

For some aircraft, both fore and aft CG limits may be  specified to vary as gross weight changes. They may also  be changed for certain operations, such as acrobatic flight,  retraction of the landing gear, or the installation of special  loads and devices that change the flight characteristics.  

The actual location of the CG can be altered by many variable  factors and is usually controlled by the pilot. Placement of  baggage and cargo items determines the CG location. The  assignment of seats to passengers can also be used as a means  of obtaining a favorable balance. If an aircraft is tail heavy,  it is only logical to place heavy passengers in forward seats.  Fuel burn can also affect the CG based on the location of the  fuel tanks. For example, most small aircraft carry fuel in the  wings very near the CG and burning off fuel has little effect  on the loaded CG.  

# Management of Weight and Balance Control  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 23,  section 23.23 requires establishment of the ranges of weights  and CGs within which an aircraft may be operated safely. The  manufacturer provides this information, which is included in  the approved AFM, TCDS, or aircraft specifications.  

While there are no specified requirements for a pilot operating  under 14 CFR part 91 to conduct weight and balance  calculations prior to each flight, 14 CFR part 91, section  91.9 requires the pilot in command (PIC) to comply with the  operating limits in the approved AFM. These limits include  the weight and balance of the aircraft. To enable pilots to  make weight and balance computations, charts and graphs  are provided in the approved AFM.  

Weight and balance control should be a matter of concern to  all pilots. The pilot controls loading and fuel management  (the two variable factors that can change both total weight  and CG location) of a particular aircraft. The aircraft owner  or operator should make certain that up-to-date information  is available for pilot use, and should ensure that appropriate  entries are made in the records when repairs or modifications  have been accomplished. The removal or addition of  equipment results in changes to the CG.  

Weight changes must be accounted for and the proper  notations made in weight and balance records. The  equipment list must be updated, if appropriate. Without such  information, the pilot has no foundation upon which to base  the necessary calculations and decisions.  

Standard parts with negligible weight or the addition of minor  items of equipment such as nuts, bolts, washers, rivets, and  similar standard parts of negligible weight on fixed-wing  aircraft do not require a weight and balance check. The  following criteria for negligible weight change is outlined  in Advisory Circular (AC) 43.13-1 (as revised), Methods  Techniques and Practices—Aircraft Inspection and Repair:  

•	 One pound or less for an aircraft whose weight empty  is less than 5,000 pounds •	 Two pounds or less for aircraft with an empty weight  of more than 5,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds •	 Five pounds or less for aircraft with an empty weight  of more than 50,000 pounds  

Negligible CG change is any change of less than 0.05 percent  Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC) for fixed-wing aircraft  or 0.2 percent for rotary wing aircraft. MAC is the average  distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the  wing. Exceeding these limits would require a weight and  balance check.  

Before any flight, the pilot should determine the weight  and balance condition of the aircraft. Simple and orderly  procedures based on sound principles have been devised  by the manufacturer for the determination of loading  conditions. The pilot uses these procedures and exercises  good judgment when determining weight and balance. In  many modern aircraft, it is not possible to fill all seats,  baggage compartments, and fuel tanks, and still remain within  the approved weight and balance limits. If the maximum  passenger load is carried, the pilot must often reduce the fuel  load or reduce the amount of baggage.  

14 CFR part 125 requires aircraft with 20 or more seats  or maximum payload capacity of 6,000 pounds or more  to be weighed every 36 calendar months. Multi-engine  aircraft operated under   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   part 135 are also required  to be weighed every 36 months. Aircraft operated under 14  CFR part 135 are exempt from the 36 month requirement  if operated under a weight and balance system approved in  the operations specifications of the certificate holder. For  additional information on approved weight and balance  control programs for operations under parts 121 and 135,  reference the current edition of AC 120-27, Aircraft Weight  and Balance Control. AC 43.13-l, Acceptable Methods,  Techniques and Practices—Aircraft Inspection and Repair  also requires that the aircraft mechanic ensure that the weight  and balance data in the aircraft records is current and accurate  after a 100-hour or annual inspection.  

# Terms and Definitions  

The pilot should be familiar with the appropriate terms  regarding weight and balance. The following list of terms  and their definitions is standardized, and knowledge of these  terms aids the pilot to better understand weight and balance  calculations of any aircraft. Terms defined by the General  Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) as industry  standard are marked in the titles with GAMA.  

• 	 Arm (moment arm)—the horizontal distance in inches  from the reference datum line to the CG of an item.  The algebraic sign is plus   $(+)$   if measured aft of the  datum and minus  $(-)$   if measured forward of the datum. • 	 Basic empty weight (GAMA)—the standard empty  weight plus the weight of optional and special  equipment that have been installed. • 	 Center of gravity (CG)—the point about which an  aircraft would balance if it were possible to suspend it  at that point. It is the mass center of the aircraft or the  theoretical point at which the entire weight of the aircraft  is assumed to be concentrated. It may be expressed in  inches from the reference datum or in percent of MAC.  The CG is a three-dimensional point with longitudinal,  lateral, and vertical positioning in the aircraft.  

• 	 CG limits—the specified forward and aft points within  which the CG must be located during flight. These  limits are indicated on pertinent aircraft specifications.

 • 	 CG range—the distance between the forward and aft  CG limits indicated on pertinent aircraft specifications.

 • 	 Datum (reference datum)—an imaginary vertical  plane or line from which all measurements of arm are  taken. The datum is established by the manufacturer.  Once the datum has been selected, all moment arms  and the location of CG range are measured from this  point.

 • 	 Delta—a Greek letter expressed by the symbol   $\triangle$   to  indicate a change of values. As an example,   $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$    indicates a change (or movement) of the CG.

 • 	 Floor load limit—the maximum weight the floor  can sustain per square inch/foot as provided by the  manufacturer.

 • 	 Fuel load—the expendable part of the load of the  aircraft. It includes only usable fuel, not fuel required  to fill the lines or that which remains trapped in the  tank sumps.

 • 	 Licensed empty weight—the empty weight that  consists of the airframe, engine(s), unusable fuel, and  undrainable oil plus standard and optional equipment  as specified in the equipment list. Some manufacturers  used this term prior to GAMA standardization.

 • 	 Maximum landing weight—the greatest weight that  an aircraft is normally allowed to have at landing.

 • 	 Maximum ramp weight—the total weight of a loaded  aircraft including all fuel. It is greater than the takeoff  weight due to the fuel that will be burned during the  taxi and run-up operations. Ramp weight may also be  referred to as taxi weight.

 • 	 Maximum takeoff weight—the maximum allowable  weight for takeoff.

 • 	 Maximum weight—the maximum authorized weight  of the aircraft and all of its equipment as specified in  the TCDS for the aircraft.

 • 	 Maximum zero fuel weight (GAMA)—the maximum  weight, exclusive of usable fuel.

 • 	 Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC)—the average  distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge of  the wing.

 • 	 Moment—the product of the weight of an item  multiplied by its arm. Moments are expressed in  pound-inches (in-lb). Total moment is the weight of  the airplane multiplied by the distance between the  datum and the CG.  

• 	 Moment index (or index)—a moment divided by a  constant such as 100, 1,000, or 10,000. The purpose  of using a moment index is to simplify weight and  balance computations of aircraft where heavy items  and long arms result in large, unmanageable numbers. • 	 Payload (GAMA)—the weight of occupants, cargo,  and baggage. • 	 Standard empty weight (GAMA)—aircraft weight  that consists of the airframe, engines, and all items of  operating equipment that have fixed locations and are  permanently installed in the aircraft, including fixed  ballast, hydraulic fluid, unusable fuel, and full engine  oil. • 	 Standard weights—established weights for numerous  items involved in weight and balance computations.  These weights should not be used if actual weights  are available. Some of the standard weights are: 	 Gasoline.................................................. 6 lb/US gal 	 Jet A, Jet A-1. ....................................... 6.8 lb/US gal 	 Jet B. ......................................................6.5 lb/US gal 	 Oil. .........................................................7.5 lb/US gal 	 Water.................................................. 8.35 lb/US gal • 	 Station—a location in the aircraft that is identified by  a number designating its distance in inches from the  datum. The datum is, therefore, identified as station  zero. An item located at station   $+50$   would have an  arm of 50 inches. • 	 Useful load—the weight of the pilot, copilot,  passengers, baggage, usable fuel, and drainable oil.  It is the basic empty weight subtracted from the  maximum allowable gross weight. This term applies  to general aviation (GA) aircraft only.  

# Principles of Weight and Balance Computations  

It is imperative that all pilots understand the basic principles  of weight and balance determination. The following methods  of computation can be applied to any object or vehicle for  which weight and balance information is essential.  

By determining the weight of the empty aircraft and adding  the weight of everything loaded on the aircraft, a total weight  can be determined—a simple concept. A greater problem,  particularly if the basic principles of weight and balance are  not understood, is distributing this weight in such a manner  that the entire mass of the loaded aircraft is balanced around  a point (CG) that must be located within specified limits.  

The point at which an aircraft balances can be determined by  locating the CG, which is, as stated in the definitions of terms,  the imaginary point at which all the weight is concentrated.  To provide the necessary balance between longitudinal  stability and elevator control, the CG is usually located  slightly forward of the center of lift. This loading condition  causes a nose-down tendency in flight, which is desirable  during flight at a high AOA and slow speeds.  

As mentioned earlier, a safe zone within which the balance  point (CG) must fall is called the CG range. The extremities  of the range are called the forward CG limits and aft CG  limits. These limits are usually specified in inches, along the  longitudinal axis of the airplane, measured from a reference  point called a datum reference. The datum is an arbitrary  point, established by aircraft designers that may vary in  location between different aircraft.  [Figure 10-2]  

The distance from the datum to any component part or any  object loaded on the aircraft is called the arm. When the  object or component is located aft of the datum, it is measured  in positive inches; if located forward of the datum, it is  measured as negative inches or minus inches. The location  of the object or part is often referred to as the station. If  the weight of any object or component is multiplied by the  distance from the datum (arm), the product is the moment.  The moment is the measurement of the gravitational force  that causes a tendency of the weight to rotate about a point  or axis and is expressed in inch-pounds (in-lb).  

To illustrate, assume a weight of 50 pounds is placed on  the board at a station or point 100 inches from the datum.  The downward force of the weight can be determined by  multiplying 50 pounds by 100 inches, which produces a  moment of 5,000 in-lb.  [Figure 10-3]  

To establish a balance, a total of 5,000 in-lb must be applied  to the other end of the board. Any combination of weight  and distance which, when multiplied, produces a 5,000 in- lb moment will balance the board. For example (illustrated  

![](images/9efcde851332fa5bf14cb02d7a0edb48bbf60dbd15d5793378c1754509d4223d.jpg)

Figure 10-3.   Determining moment.  

in  Figure 10-4) , if a 100-pound weight is placed at a point  (station) 25 inches from the datum, and another 50-pound  weight is placed at a point (station) 50 inches from the datum,  the sum of the product of the two weights and their distances  total a moment of 5,000 in-lb, which will balance the board.  

# Weight and Balance Restrictions  

An aircraft’s weight and balance restrictions should be  closely followed. The loading conditions and empty weight  of a particular aircraft may differ from that found in the  AFM/POH because modifications or equipment changes  may have been made. Sample loading problems in the  AFM/POH are intended for guidance only; therefore, each  aircraft must be treated separately. Although an aircraft is  certified for a specified maximum gross takeoff weight, it  may not safely take off at this weight under all conditions.  Conditions that affect takeoff and climb performance, such as  high elevations, high temperatures, and high humidity (high  density altitudes), may require a reduction in weight before  flight is attempted. Other factors to consider when computing  

![](images/52ee538e05c8be50a589d9d0f5192113f686d13b12798cb0746861367c5b58bf.jpg)  
Figure 10-4.  Establishing a balance.  

weight and balance distribution prior to takeoff are runway  length, runway surface, runway slope, surface wind, and the  presence of obstacles. These factors may require a reduction  in or redistribution of weight prior to flight.  

Some aircraft are designed so that it is difficult to load them  in a manner that places the CG out of limits. These are  usually small aircraft with the seats, fuel, and baggage areas  located near the CG limit. Pilots must be aware that while  within CG limits these aircraft can be overloaded in weight.  Other aircraft can be loaded in such a manner that they will  be out of CG limits even though the useful load has not been  exceeded. Because of the effects of an out-of-balance or  overweight condition, a pilot should always be sure that an  aircraft is properly loaded.  

# Determining Loaded Weight and CG  

There are various methods for determining the loaded weight  and CG of an aircraft. There is the computational method as  well as methods that utilize graphs and tables provided by  the aircraft manufacturer.  

# Computational Method  

The following is an example of the computational method  involving the application of basic math functions.  

Aircraft Allowances:  

Maximum gross weight......................3,400 pounds CG range.............................................78–86 inches  

Given:  

Weight of front seat occupants.............340 pounds 	 Weight of rear seat occupants..............350 pounds 	 Fuel...........................................................75 gallons 	 Weight of baggage in area 1....................80 pounds 1.	 List the weight of the aircraft, occupants, fuel, and  baggage. Remember that aviation gas (AVGAS)  weighs 6 pounds per gallon and is used in this  example. 2.	 Enter the moment for each item listed. Remember  “weight  x  arm  $=$   moment.” 3.	 Find the total weight and total moment. 4.	 To determine the CG, divide the total moment by the  total weight.  

NOTE: The weight and balance records for a particular  aircraft provide the empty weight and moment, as well as the  information on the arm distance.  [Figure 10-5]  

The total loaded weight of 3,320 pounds does not exceed  the maximum gross weight of 3,400 pounds, and the CG of  

![Figure 10-5.   Example of weight and balance computations. ](images/5f0db4a011ba611a066fda7989dcc6cf26a3bd9f56cf854cd22dfbb3dc63547d.jpg)  

84.8 is within the 78–86 inch range; therefore, the aircraft is  loaded within limits.  

# Graph Method  

Another method for determining the loaded weight and CG is  the use of graphs provided by the manufacturers. To simplify  calculations, the moment may sometimes be divided by 100,  1,000, or 10,000.  [Figures 10-6, 10-7, and 10-8]  

Front seat occupants....................................340 pounds Rear seat occupants.......................................300 pounds Fuel	 .................................................................40 gallons Baggage area 1................................................20 pounds  

The same steps should be followed in the graph method as  were used in the computational method except the graphs  provided will calculate the moments and allow the pilot to  determine if the aircraft is loaded within limits. To determine  the moment using the loading graph, find the weight and draw  a line straight across until it intercepts the item for which the  moment is to be calculated. Then draw a line straight down  to determine the moment. (The red line on the loading graph  in  Figure 10-7  represents the moment for the pilot and front  passenger. All other moments were determined the same  

![Figure 10-6.  Weight and balance data. ](images/40045f2c11ec7ceadaf67958bbad9997dda445a6be1449d615d3d8e590cd1f00.jpg)

way.) Once this has been done for each item, total the weight  and moments and draw a line for both weight and moment  on the CG envelope graph. If the lines intersect within the  envelope, the aircraft is loaded within limits. In this sample  loading problem, the aircraft is loaded within limits.  

# Table Method  

The table method applies the same principles as the  computational and graph methods. The information  and limitations are contained in tables provided by the  manufacturer.  Figure 10-9  is an example of a table and a  

![](images/e4760e1922cf60ea969c0b9ee029fc71cc31c0c1b57123fdf70b26daa3a1940b.jpg)  
Figure 10-9.  Loading schedule placard.  

weight and balance calculation based on that table. In this  problem, the total weight of 2,799 pounds and moment of  2,278/100 are within the limits of the table.  

# Computations With a Negative Arm  

Figure 10-10  is a sample of weight and balance computation  using an aircraft with a negative arm. It is important to  remember that a positive times a negative equals a negative,  and a negative would be subtracted from the total moments.  

# Computations With Zero Fuel Weight  

Figure 10-11  is a sample of weight and balance computation  using an aircraft with a zero fuel weight. In this example,  the total weight of the aircraft less fuel is 4,240 pounds,  which is under the zero fuel weight of 4,400 pounds. If the  total weight of the aircraft without fuel had exceeded 4,400  pounds, passengers or cargo would have needed to be reduced  to bring the weight at or below the max zero fuel weight.  

# Shifting, Adding, and Removing Weight  

A pilot must be able to solve any problems accurately that  involve the shift, addition, or removal of weight. For example,  the pilot may load the aircraft within the allowable takeoff  weight limit, then find that the CG limit has been exceeded.  The most satisfactory solution to this problem is to shift  baggage, passengers, or both. The pilot should be able to  determine the minimum load shift needed to make the aircraft  safe for flight. Pilots should be able to determine if shifting a  load to a new location will correct an out-of-limit condition.  There are some standardized calculations that can help make  these determinations.  

# Weight Shifting  

When weight is shifted from one location to another, the  total weight of the aircraft is unchanged. The total moments,  however, do change in relation and proportion to the  direction and distance the weight is moved. When weight is  moved forward, the total moments decrease; when weight  is moved aft, total moments increase. The moment change  is proportional to the amount of weight moved. Since many  

![Figure 10-10.  Sample weight and balance using a negative. ](images/842c6e5651ade05e3a7f766702bc00ca09a3ac9ad475d8beb1f350cef1d32454.jpg)  

![Figure 10-11.  Sample weight and balance using an aircraft with a  published zero fuel weight. ](images/6a2b40efedfe6db6b95158c40197186c05448aebdd86925caaabd5fb0b2d5634.jpg)  
\*Fuel for start, taxi, and takeoff is normally 24 pounds.  

aircraft have forward and aft baggage compartments, weight  may be shifted from one to the other to change the CG. If  starting with a known aircraft weight, CG, and total moments,  calculate the new CG (after the weight shift) by dividing the  new total moments by the total aircraft weight.  

To determine the new total moments, find out how many  moments are gained or lost when the weight is shifted.  Assume that 100 pounds has been shifted from station 30 to  station 150. This movement increases the total moments of  the aircraft by 12,000 in-lb.  

Moment when at station 150	  $=100\;\mathrm{lb}\times150\;\mathrm{in}=15{,}000\;\mathrm{in}{.}$  -lb  

Moment when  

at station 30	  $\mathrm{\Gamma=100\;lb\times30\;i n=3,000\;i n-}$  lb Moment change  	= [15,000 –  $=[15,\!000-3,\!000]=12{,}000{\mathrm{~in}}{\cdot}{\mathrm{l}}$  

By adding the moment change to the original moment (or  subtracting if the weight has been moved forward instead of  aft), the new total moments are obtained. Then determine the  new CG by dividing the new moments by the total weight:  

$$
\mathrm{616,000\;in{\mathrm{-}}l b+12,000\;in{\mathrm{-}}l b=628,000\;in{\mathrm{-}}l b}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{CG}=\frac{628{,}000\;\mathrm{in}{\cdot}\mathrm{db}}{8{,}000\;\mathrm{lb}}\!=\!78.5\;\mathrm{in}
$$  

The shift has caused the CG to shift to station 78.5.  

![](images/f2fdaabec10aa59a99443b86f076063899eccab289242eedc155f8fa5f56c4ea.jpg)  

The change of CG is added to (or subtracted from when appropriate)   the original CG to determine the new CG:    $77+1.5=78.5$   inches aft of datum  

The shifting weight proportion formula can also be used to determine   how much weight must be shifted to achieve a particular shift of the CG.   The following problem illustrates a solution of this type.  

# Example  

Aircraft total weight . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,800 lb  CG station. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  81.5 in  Aft CG limit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   80.5 in  

Determine how much cargo must be shifted from the aft cargo compart-  ment at station 150 to the forward cargo compartment at station 30 to   move the CG to exactly the aft limit.  

# Solution:  

![](images/a3c02e352677d6f2fd094db4aa25c827cc2f4612c9d0c48fff27bef4235c5cdf.jpg)  

A simpler solution may be obtained by using a computer  or calculator and a proportional formula. This can be done  because the CG will shift a distance that is proportional to  the distance the weight is shifted.  

# Weight Addition or Removal  

In many instances, the weight and balance of the aircraft will  be changed by the addition or removal of weight. When this  happens, a new CG must be calculated and checked against  the limitations to see if the location is acceptable. This type  of weight and balance problem is commonly encountered  when the aircraft burns fuel in flight, thereby reducing the  weight located at the fuel tanks. Most small aircraft are  designed with the fuel tanks positioned close to the CG;  therefore, the consumption of fuel does not affect the CG to  any great extent.  

The addition or removal of cargo presents a CG change  problem that must be calculated before flight. The problem  may always be solved by calculations involving total  moments. A typical problem may involve the calculation  of a new CG for an aircraft which, when loaded and ready  for flight, receives some additional cargo or passengers just  before departure time.  

![](images/deb512df8992ba4e107a4ef260f76bea6db8316eefe1ce1c713dde32ebebc043.jpg)  

![](images/bbc36578be08500a7d270bc5847e399ded4d0f3e82c5df669c334274dac67c3b.jpg)  

In the previous examples, the   $\triangle\mathbf{C}\mathbf{G}$   is either added or  subtracted from the old CG. Deciding which to accomplish is  best handled by mentally calculating which way the CG will  shift for the particular weight change. If the CG is shifting  aft, the   $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$   is added to the old CG; if the CG is shifting  forward, the  $\triangle\mathrm{CG}$   is subtracted from the old CG.  

# Chapter Summary  

Operating an aircraft within the weight and balance limits  is critical to flight safety. Pilots must ensure that the CG is  and remains within approved limits throughout all phases of  a flight. For additional information on weight, balance, CG,  and aircraft stability refer to the FAA handbook appropriate  to the specific aircraft category.  

# Aircraft  Performance  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses the factors that affect aircraft  performance, which include the aircraft weight, atmospheric  conditions, runway environment, and the fundamental  physical laws governing the forces acting on an aircraft.  

# Importance of Performance Data  

The performance or operational information section of the  Aircraft Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook (AFM/ POH) contains the operating data for the aircraft; that is, the  data pertaining to takeoff, climb, range, endurance, descent,  and landing. The use of this data in flying operations is  mandatory for safe and efficient operation. Considerable  knowledge and familiarity of the aircraft can be gained by  studying this material.  

![](images/2b8cde41c5c50db12ac8dd8038f3eb5f5427d614938479169464e76b2a46f53b.jpg)  

It must be emphasized that the manufacturers’ information  and data furnished in the AFM/POH is not standardized.  Some provide the data in tabular form, while others use  graphs. In addition, the performance data may be presented  on the basis of standard atmospheric conditions, pressure  altitude, or density altitude. The performance information in  the AFM/POH has little or no value unless the user recognizes  those variations and makes the necessary adjustments.  

To be able to make practical use of the aircraft’s capabilities  and limitations, it is essential to understand the significance  of the operational data. The pilot must be cognizant of the  basis for the performance data, as well as the meanings of  the various terms used in expressing performance capabilities  and limitations.  

Since the characteristics of the atmosphere have a major  effect on performance, it is necessary to review two dominant  factors—pressure and temperature.  

# Structure of the Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is an envelope of air that surrounds the  Earth and rests upon its surface. It is as much a part of the  Earth as is land and water. However, air differs from land  and water in that it is a mixture of gases. It has mass, weight,  and indefinite shape.  

Air, like any other fluid, is able to flow and change its shape  when subjected to even minute pressures because of the  lack of strong molecular cohesion. For example, gas will  completely fill any container into which it is placed, expanding  or contracting to adjust its shape to the limits of the container.  

The atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21  percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases, such as argon  or helium. Most of the oxygen is contained below 35,000  feet altitude.  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

Though there are various kinds of pressure, pilots are mainly  concerned with atmospheric pressure. It is one of the basic  factors in weather changes, helps to lift the aircraft, and  actuates some of the most important flight instruments in the  aircraft. These instruments often include the altimeter, the  airspeed indicator (ASI), the vertical speed indicator (VSI),  and the manifold pressure gauge.  

Though air is very light, it has mass and is affected by the  attraction of gravity. Therefore, like any other substance, it  has weight; because it has weight, it has force. Since it is a  fluid substance, this force is exerted equally in all directions,  and its effect on bodies within the air is called pressure.  Under standard conditions at sea level, the average pressure  exerted by the weight of the atmosphere is approximately 14.7  pounds per square inch (psi). The density of air has significant  effects on the aircraft’s performance. As air becomes less  dense, it reduces:  

•	 Power, because the engine takes in less air •	 Thrust, because the propeller is less efficient in thin air •	 Lift, because the thin air exerts less force on the airfoils  

The pressure of the atmosphere may vary with time but more  importantly, it varies with altitude and temperature. Due to  the changing atmospheric pressure, a standard reference  was developed. The standard atmosphere at sea level has  a surface temperature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit   $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   or 15  degrees Celsius   $(^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$   and a surface pressure of 29.92 inches  of mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   or 1013.2 millibars (mb).  [Figure 11-1]  

A standard temperature lapse rate is one in which the  temperature decreases at the rate of approximately  $3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or   $2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per thousand feet up to 36,000 feet. Above this point,  the temperature is considered constant up to 80,000 feet. A  standard pressure lapse rate is one in which pressure decreases  at a rate of approximately 1 "Hg per 1,000 feet of altitude gain  to 10,000 feet.  [Figure 11-2]  The International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) has established this as a worldwide  standard, and it is often referred to as International Standard  Atmosphere (ISA) or ICAO Standard Atmosphere. Any  temperature or pressure that differs from the standard lapse  rates is considered nonstandard temperature and pressure.  Adjustments for nonstandard temperatures and pressures are  provided on the manufacturer’s performance charts.

Since all aircraft performance is compared and evaluated  using the standard atmosphere, all aircraft instruments  are calibrated for the standard atmosphere. Thus, certain  corrections must apply to the instrumentation, as well as the  aircraft performance, if the actual operating conditions do  not fit the standard atmosphere. In order to account properly  for the nonstandard atmosphere, certain related terms must  be defined.  

# Pressure Altitude  

Pressure altitude is the height above the standard datum  plane (SDP). The aircraft altimeter is essentially a sensitive  barometer calibrated to indicate altitude in the standard  atmosphere. If the altimeter is set for   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   SDP, the  altitude indicated is the pressure altitude—the altitude in the  standard atmosphere corresponding to the sensed pressure.  

The SDP is a theoretical level at which the pressure of the  atmosphere is  $29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}$   and the weight of air is 14.7 psi. As  atmospheric pressure changes, the SDP may be below, at, or  above sea level. Pressure altitude is important as a basis for  determining aircraft performance, as well as for assigning  flight levels to aircraft operating at above 18,000 feet.  

The pressure altitude can be determined by any of the three  following methods:  

1. 	 By setting the barometric scale of the altimeter to   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   and reading the indicated altitude,  

2. 	 By applying a correction factor to the indicated  altitude according to the reported “altimeter setting,”  [Figure 11-3]  

# Density Altitude  

The more appropriate term for correlating aerodynamic  performance in the nonstandard atmosphere is density  altitude—the altitude in the standard atmosphere  corresponding to a particular value of air density.  

Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard  temperature. As the density of the air increases (lower  density altitude), aircraft performance increases. Conversely,  

![](images/30cc2dfbf7e51cc3d24e2c13eb1f2af0434f4f1c2208a20dc3120231f18bd6e8.jpg)

as air density decreases (higher density altitude), aircraft  performance decreases. A decrease in air density means a  high density altitude; an increase in air density means a lower  density altitude. Density altitude is used in calculating aircraft  performance. Under standard atmospheric condition, air at  each level in the atmosphere has a specific density; under  standard conditions, pressure altitude and density altitude  identify the same level. Density altitude, then, is the vertical  distance above sea level in the standard atmosphere at which  a given density is to be found.  

Density altitude is computed using pressure altitude and  temperature. Since aircraft performance data at any level is  based upon air density under standard day conditions, such  performance data apply to air density levels that may not be  identical to altimeter indications. Under conditions higher  or lower than standard, these levels cannot be determined  directly from the altimeter.  

Density altitude is determined by first finding pressure  altitude and then correcting this altitude for nonstandard  temperature variations. Since density varies directly with  pressure, and inversely with temperature, a given pressure  altitude may exist for a wide range of temperature by allowing  the density to vary. However, a known density occurs for  any one temperature and pressure altitude. The density of the  air, of course, has a pronounced effect on aircraft and engine  performance. Regardless of the actual altitude at which  the aircraft is operating, it will perform as though it were  operating at an altitude equal to the existing density altitude.  

For example, when set at   $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  , the altimeter may  indicate a pressure altitude of 5,000 feet. According to the  AFM/POH, the ground run on takeoff may require a distance  of 790 feet under standard temperature conditions. However,  if the temperature is  $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   above standard, the expansion of  air raises the density level. Using temperature correction data  from tables or graphs, or by deriving the density altitude with  a computer, it may be found that the density level is above  7,000 feet, and the ground run may be closer to 1,000 feet.  

Air density is affected by changes in altitude, temperature,  and humidity. High density altitude refers to thin air while  low density altitude refers to dense air. The conditions that  result in a high density altitude are high elevations, low  atmospheric pressures, high temperatures, high humidity, or  some combination of these factors. Lower elevations, high  atmospheric pressure, low temperatures, and low humidity  are more indicative of low density altitude.  

Using a flight computer, density altitude can be computed by  inputting the pressure altitude and outside air temperature at  flight level. Density altitude can also be determined by referring  to the table and chart in  Figures 11-3 and 11-4  respectively.  

# Effects of Pressure on Density  

Since air is a gas, it can be compressed or expanded. When  air is compressed, a greater amount of air can occupy a  given volume. Conversely, when pressure on a given volume  of air is decreased, the air expands and occupies a greater  space. That is, the original column of air at a lower pressure  

![](images/73ee94d487615fc9d762ee7afccb22d290a6eba38fdd23a81cdbc93502366404.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.  Density altitude chart.  

contains a smaller mass of air. In other words, the density is  decreased. In fact, density is directly proportional to pressure.  If the pressure is doubled, the density is doubled, and if the  pressure is lowered, so is the density. This statement is true  only at a constant temperature.  

# Effects of Temperature on Density  

Increasing the temperature of a substance decreases its  density. Conversely, decreasing the temperature increases  the density. Thus, the density of air varies inversely with  temperature. This statement is true only at a constant pressure.  

In the atmosphere, both temperature and pressure decrease  with altitude and have conflicting effects upon density.  However, the fairly rapid drop in pressure as altitude is  increased usually has the dominant effect. Hence, pilots can  expect the density to decrease with altitude.  

# Effects of Humidity (Moisture) on Density  

The preceding paragraphs are based on the presupposition of  perfectly dry air. In reality, it is never completely dry. The  small amount of water vapor suspended in the atmosphere  may be negligible under certain conditions, but in other  conditions humidity may become an important factor in the  performance of an aircraft. Water vapor is lighter than air;  consequently, moist air is lighter than dry air. Therefore, as the  water content of the air increases, the air becomes less dense,  increasing density altitude and decreasing performance. It is  lightest or least dense when, in a given set of conditions, it  contains the maximum amount of water vapor.  

Humidity, also called relative humidity, refers to the amount  of water vapor contained in the atmosphere and is expressed  as a percentage of the maximum amount of water vapor  the air can hold. This amount varies with the temperature;  warm air can hold more water vapor, while colder air can  hold less. Perfectly dry air that contains no water vapor has  a relative humidity of zero percent, while saturated air that  cannot hold any more water vapor has a relative humidity  of 100 percent. Humidity alone is usually not considered an  essential factor in calculating density altitude and aircraft  performance; however, it does contribute.  

The higher the temperature, the greater amount of water  vapor that the air can hold. When comparing two separate air  masses, the first warm and moist (both qualities making air  lighter) and the second cold and dry (both qualities making  it heavier), the first must be less dense than the second.  Pressure, temperature, and humidity have a great influence  on aircraft performance because of their effect upon density.  There is no rule-of-thumb or chart used to compute the effects  of humidity on density altitude, but it must be taken into  consideration. Expect a decrease in overall performance in  high humidity conditions.  

# Performance  

Performance is a term used to describe the ability of an  aircraft to accomplish certain things that make it useful for  certain purposes. For example, the ability of an aircraft to land  and take off in a very short distance is an important factor  to the pilot who operates in and out of short, unimproved  airfields. The ability to carry heavy loads, fly at high altitudes  at fast speeds, and/or travel long distances is essential for the  performance of airline and executive type aircraft.  

The primary factors most affected by performance are the  takeoff and landing distance, rate of climb, ceiling, payload,  range, speed, maneuverability, stability, and fuel economy.  Some of these factors are often directly opposed: for example,  high speed versus short landing distance, long range versus  great payload, and high rate of climb versus fuel economy.  It is the preeminence of one or more of these factors that  dictates differences between aircraft and explains the high  degree of specialization found in modern aircraft.  

The various items of aircraft performance result from the  combination of aircraft and powerplant characteristics. The  aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft generally define  the power and thrust requirements at various conditions of  flight, while powerplant characteristics generally define the  power and thrust available at various conditions of flight.  The matching of the aerodynamic configuration with the  powerplant is accomplished by the manufacturer to provide  maximum performance at the specific design condition (e.g.,  range, endurance, and climb).  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

All of the principal components of flight performance involve  steady-state flight conditions and equilibrium of the aircraft.  For the aircraft to remain in steady, level flight, equilibrium  must be obtained by a lift equal to the aircraft weight and a  powerplant thrust equal to the aircraft drag. Thus, the aircraft  drag defines the thrust required to maintain steady, level  flight. As presented in Chapter 4, Aerodynamics of Flight,  all parts of an aircraft contribute to the drag, either induced  (from lifting surfaces) or parasite drag.  

While parasite drag predominates at high speed, induced drag  predominates at low speed.  [Figure 11-5]  For example, if  an aircraft in a steady flight condition at 100 knots is then  accelerated to 200 knots, the parasite drag becomes four  times as great, but the power required to overcome that  drag is eight times the original value. Conversely, when the  

![](images/0d0b3521f0d7194218464c0640a5cac97f982db04a8047c649d821dcd2c49cf2.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.  Drag versus speed.  

aircraft is operated in steady, level flight at twice as great a  speed, the induced drag is one-fourth the original value, and  the power required to overcome that drag is only one-half  the original value.  

When an aircraft is in steady, level flight, the condition of  equilibrium must prevail. The unaccelerated condition of  flight is achieved with the aircraft trimmed for lift equal  to weight and the powerplant set for a thrust to equal the  aircraft drag.  

The maximum level flight speed for the aircraft is obtained  when the power or thrust required equals the maximum power  or thrust available from the powerplant.  [Figure 11-6]  The  minimum level flight airspeed is not usually defined by thrust  or power requirement since conditions of stall or stability and  control problems generally predominate.  

# Climb Performance  

If an aircraft is to move, fly, and perform, work must act  upon it. Work involves force moving the aircraft. The aircraft  acquires mechanical energy when it moves. Mechanical  

![](images/961dd6d218de136375e71c38cb962c779564a8ed57f30163a2723d389eea472b.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.  Power versus speed.  

energy comes in two forms: (1) Kinetic Energy (KE), the  energy of speed; (2) Potential Energy (PE), the stored energy  of position.  

Aircraft motion (KE) is described by its velocity (airspeed).  Aircraft position (PE) is described by its height (altitude).  Both KE and PE are directly proportional to the object’s  mass. KE is directly proportional to the square of the object’s  velocity (airspeed). PE is directly proportional to the object’s  height (altitude). The formulas below summarize these  energy relationships:  

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\mathrm{KE}=\mathrm{1}\gamma_{\mathrm{2}}\times\mathrm{m}\times\mathrm{v}^{\mathrm{2}}\quad\quad}}&{{\mathrm{m}=\mathrm{object}\;\mathrm{mass}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}&{{\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{object}\;\mathrm{velocity}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}&{{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{PE}=\mathrm{m}\times\mathrm{g}\times\mathrm{h}\quad\quad}}&{{\mathrm{g}=\mathrm{gravity}\;\mathrm{field}\;\mathrm{strength}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}&{{\mathrm{h}=\mathrm{object}\;\mathrm{height}}}\end{array}
$$  

We sometimes use the terms “power” and “thrust”  interchangeably when discussing climb performance. This  erroneously implies the terms are synonymous. It is important  to distinguish between these terms. Thrust is a force or  pressure exerted on an object. Thrust is measured in pounds  (lb) or newtons (N). Power, however, is a measurement of  the rate of performing work or transferring energy (KE and  PE). Power is typically measured in horsepower (hp) or  kilowatts (kw). We can think of power as the motion (KE  and PE) a force (thrust) creates when exerted on an object  over a period of time.  

Positive climb performance occurs when an aircraft gains PE  by increasing altitude. Two basic factors, or a combination  of the two factors, contribute to positive climb performance  in most aircraft:  

1. 	 The aircraft climbs (gains PE) using excess power  above that required to maintain level flight, or  2. 	 The aircraft climbs by converting airspeed (KE) to  altitude (PE).  

As an example of factor 1 above, an aircraft with an engine  capable of producing 200 horsepower (at a given altitude)  is using only 130 horsepower to maintain level flight at that  altitude. This leaves 70 horsepower available to climb. The  pilot holds airspeed constant and increases power to perform  the climb.  

As an example of factor 2, an aircraft is flying level at 120  knots. The pilot leaves the engine power setting constant but  applies other control inputs to perform a climb. The climb,  sometimes called a zoom climb, converts the airspeed (KE)  

to altitude (PE); the airspeed decreases to something less  than 120 knots as the altitude increases.  

There are two primary reasons to evaluate climb performance.  First, aircraft must climb over obstacles to avoid hitting  them. Second, climbing to higher altitudes can provide  better weather, fuel economy, and other benefits. Maximum  Angle of Climb (AOC), obtained at  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  , may provide climb  performance to ensure an aircraft will clear obstacles.  Maximum Rate of Climb (ROC), obtained at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  , provides  climb performance to achieve the greatest altitude gain over  time. Maximum ROC may not be sufficient to avoid obstacles  in some situations, while maximum AOC may be sufficient  to avoid the same obstacles.  [Figure 11-7]  

# Angle of Climb (AOC)  

AOC is a comparison of altitude gained relative to distance  traveled. AOC is the inclination (angle) of the flight path. For  maximum AOC performance, a pilot flies the aircraft at  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  

![](images/95ca528b6427abeec245383bebd62e9ab30cd7f0808cd0930f6ac62938af0ccc.jpg)  
Figure 11-7.  Maximum angle of climb  $(A O C)$   versus maximum rate  of climb (ROC).  

so as to achieve maximum altitude increase with minimum  horizontal travel over the ground. A good use of maximum  AOC is when taking off from a short airfield surrounded by  high obstacles, such as trees or power lines. The objective is  to gain sufficient altitude to clear the obstacle while traveling  the least horizontal distance over the surface.  

One method to climb (have positive AOC performance) is  to have excess thrust available. Essentially, the greater the  force that pushes the aircraft upward, the steeper it can climb. Maximum AOC occurs at the airspeed and angle of attack  (AOA) combination which allows the maximum excess  thrust. The airspeed and AOA combination where excess  thrust exists varies amongst aircraft types. As an example,  Figure 11-8  provides a comparison between jet and propeller  airplanes as to where maximum excess thrust (for maximum  AOC) occurs. In a jet, maximum excess thrust normally  occurs at the airspeed where the thrust required is at a  minimum (approximately  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  ). In a propeller airplane,  maximum excess thrust normally occurs at an airspeed below   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$   and frequently just above stall speed.  

# Rate of Climb (ROC)  

ROC is a comparison of altitude gained relative to the time  needed to reach that altitude. ROC is simply the vertical  component of the aircraft’s flight path velocity vector. For  maximum ROC performance, a pilot flies the aircraft at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  so as to achieve a maximum gain in altitude over a given  period of time.  

Maximum ROC expedites a climb to an assigned altitude.  This gains the greatest vertical distance over a period of  time. For example, in a maximum AOC profile, a certain  aircraft takes 30 seconds to reach 1,000 feet AGL, but  covers only 3,000 feet over the ground. By comparison,  using its maximum ROC profile, the same aircraft climbs  

![](images/ed8e84f01b045041efefec105b6c6737328eb82f0a9f6c1576ca01ffc7467ed9.jpg)  
Figure 11-8.  Comparison of maximum AOC between jet and propeller airplanes.  

to 1,500 feet in 30 seconds but covers 6,000 feet across the  ground. Note that both ROC and AOC maximum climb  profiles use the aircraft’s maximum throttle setting. Any  differences between max ROC and max AOC lie primarily  in the velocity (airspeed) and AOA combination the aircraft  manual specifies.  [Figure 11-7]  

ROC performance depends upon excess power. Since  climbing is work and power is the rate of performing work,  a pilot can increase the climb rate by using any power not  used to maintain level flight. Maximum ROC occurs at an  airspeed and AOA combination that produces the maximum  excess power. Therefore, maximum ROC for a typical jet  airplane occurs at an airspeed greater than  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$   and at an  AOA less than  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}\,A O A}$  . In contrast, maximum ROC for  a typical propeller airplane occurs at an airspeed and AOA  combination closer to  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  .  [Figure 11-9]  

# Climb Performance Factors  

Since weight, altitude and configuration changes affect  excess thrust and power, they also affect climb performance.  Climb performance is directly dependent upon the ability to  produce either excess thrust or excess power. Earlier in the  book it was shown that an increase in weight, an increase in  altitude, lowering the landing gear, or lowering the flaps all  decrease both excess thrust and excess power for all aircraft.  Therefore, maximum AOC and maximum ROC performance  decreases under any of these conditions.  

Weight has a very pronounced effect on aircraft performance.  If weight is added to an aircraft, it must fly at a higher AOA  to maintain a given altitude and speed. This increases the  induced drag of the wings, as well as the parasite drag of the  aircraft. Increased drag means that additional thrust is needed  to overcome it, which in turn means that less reserve thrust is  available for climbing. Aircraft designers go to great lengths  to minimize the weight, since it has such a marked effect on  the factors pertaining to performance.  

A change in an aircraft’s weight produces a twofold effect  on climb performance. First, a change in weight changes the  drag and the power required. This alters the reserve power  available, which in turn, affects both the climb angle and  the climb rate. Secondly, an increase in weight reduces the  maximum ROC, but the aircraft must be operated at a higher  climb speed to achieve the smaller peak climb rate.  

An increase in altitude also increases the power required  and decreases the power available. Therefore, the climb  performance of an aircraft diminishes with altitude. The  speeds for maximum ROC, maximum AOC, and maximum  and minimum level flight airspeeds vary with altitude. As  altitude is increased, these various speeds finally converge  at the absolute ceiling of the aircraft. At the absolute ceiling,  there is no excess of power and only one speed allows steady,  level flight. Consequently, the absolute ceiling of an aircraft  produces zero ROC. The service ceiling is the altitude at  which the aircraft is unable to climb at a rate greater than 100  feet per minute (fpm). Usually, these specific performance  reference points are provided for the aircraft at a specific  design configuration.  [Figure 11-10]  

The terms “power loading,” “wing loading,” “blade loading,”  and “disk loading” are commonly used in reference to  performance. Power loading is expressed in pounds per  horsepower and is obtained by dividing the total weight  of the aircraft by the rated horsepower of the engine. It  is a significant factor in an aircraft’s takeoff and climb  capabilities. Wing loading is expressed in pounds per square  foot and is obtained by dividing the total weight of an airplane  in pounds by the wing area (including ailerons) in square feet.  It is the airplane’s wing loading that determines the landing  

![](images/5659b9bbb119308f8e39e48ab6c423ec88605c37e816821bf4d495798912f89e.jpg)

speed. Blade loading is expressed in pounds per square foot  and is obtained by dividing the total weight of a helicopter by  the area of the rotor blades. Blade loading is not to be confused  with disk loading, which is the total weight of a helicopter  divided by the area of the disk swept by the rotor blades.  

# Range Performance  

The ability of an aircraft to convert fuel energy into flying  distance is one of the most important items of aircraft  performance. In flying operations, the problem of efficient  range operation of an aircraft appears in two general forms:  

1. 	 To extract the maximum flying distance from a given  fuel load 2. 	 To fly a specified distance with a minimum  expenditure of fuel  

A common element for each of these operating problems  is the specific range; that is, nautical miles (NM) of flying  distance versus the amount of fuel consumed. Range must  be clearly distinguished from the item of endurance. Range  involves consideration of flying distance, while endurance  involves consideration of flying time. Thus, it is appropriate  to define a separate term, specific endurance.  

![](images/74e08e819413ab785e88038cd71f789618692c6f297c79ff5ea45b815072b2f9.jpg)  

Fuel flow can be defined in either pounds or gallons. If  maximum endurance is desired, the flight condition must  provide a minimum fuel flow. In  Figure 11-11  at point A,  the airspeed is low and fuel flow is high. This would occur  during ground operations or when taking off and climbing.  As airspeed is increased, power requirements decrease due  to aerodynamic factors, and fuel flow decreases to point B.  This is the point of maximum endurance. Beyond this point,  increases in airspeed come at a cost. Airspeed increases  require additional power and fuel flow increases with  additional power.  

Cruise flight operations for maximum range should be  conducted so that the aircraft obtains maximum specific range  throughout the flight. The specific range can be defined by  the following relationship.  

![](images/6564b650e354fc76e6c163bc0c6a86e15243f7f1ddd4515b9ab7df30ce97be8c.jpg)

# specific range  $=$  

If maximum specific range is desired, the flight condition  must provide a maximum of speed per fuel flow. While  the peak value of specific range would provide maximum  range operation, long-range cruise operation is generally  recommended at a slightly higher airspeed. Most long-range  cruise operations are conducted at the flight condition that  provides 99 percent of the absolute maximum specific range.  The advantage of such operation is that one percent of range  is traded for three to five percent higher cruise speed. Since  the higher cruise speed has a great number of advantages, the  small sacrifice of range is a fair bargain. The values of specific  range versus speed are affected by three principal variables:  

1. 	 Aircraft gross weight  

2. 	 Altitude 3. 	 The external aerodynamic configuration of the aircraft.  

These are the source of range and endurance operating data  included in the performance section of the AFM/POH.  

Cruise control of an aircraft implies that the aircraft is  operated to maintain the recommended long-range cruise  condition throughout the flight. Since fuel is consumed during  cruise, the gross weight of the aircraft varies and optimum  airspeed, altitude, and power setting can also vary. Cruise  control means the control of the optimum airspeed, altitude,  and power setting to maintain the 99 percent maximum  specific range condition. At the beginning of cruise flight, the  relatively high initial weight of the aircraft requires specific  values of airspeed, altitude, and power setting to produce the  recommended cruise condition. As fuel is consumed and the  aircraft’s gross weight decreases, the optimum airspeed and  power setting may decrease, or the optimum altitude may  increase. In addition, the optimum specific range increases.  Therefore, the pilot must provide the proper cruise control  procedure to ensure that optimum conditions are maintained.  

Total range is dependent on both fuel available and specific  range. When range and economy of operation are the principal  goals, the pilot must ensure that the aircraft is operated at the  recommended long-range cruise condition. By this procedure,  the aircraft is capable of its maximum design-operating radius  or can achieve flight distances less than the maximum with  a maximum of fuel reserve at the destination.  

A propeller-driven aircraft combines the propeller with the  reciprocating engine for propulsive power. Fuel flow is  determined mainly by the shaft power put into the propeller  rather than thrust. Thus, the fuel flow can be related directly  to the power required to maintain the aircraft in steady, level  flight, and on performance charts power can be substituted  for fuel flow. This fact allows for the determination of range  through analysis of power required versus speed.  

The maximum endurance condition would be obtained at the  point of minimum power required since this would require the  lowest fuel flow to keep the airplane in steady, level flight.  Maximum range condition would occur where the ratio of  speed to power required is greatest.  [Figure 11-11]  

The maximum range condition is obtained at maximum lift/ drag ratio  $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$  , and it is important to note that for a given  aircraft configuration, the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$   occurs at a particular AOA  and lift coefficient and is unaffected by weight or altitude. A  variation in weight alters the values of airspeed and power  required to obtain the   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  .  [Figure 11-12]  Different  theories exist on how to achieve max range when there is a  headwind or tailwind present. Many say that speeding up in  a headwind or slowing down in a tail wind helps to achieve  max range. While this theory may be true in a lot of cases,  it is not always true as there are different variables to every  situation. Each aircraft configuration is different, and there  is not a rule of thumb that encompasses all of them as to how  to achieve the max range.  

![](images/b88eebb82486b4a97e20b61c43ad2eb3edbe1187832b70768b7a0d59df7a4689.jpg)  
Figure 11-12.  Effect of weight.  

The variations of speed and power required must be  monitored by the pilot as part of the cruise control procedure  to maintain the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  . When the aircraft’s fuel weight is a  small part of the gross weight and the aircraft’s range is small,  the cruise control procedure can be simplified to essentially  maintaining a constant speed and power setting throughout  the time of cruise flight. However, a long-range aircraft has a  fuel weight that is a considerable part of the gross weight, and  cruise control procedures must employ scheduled airspeed  and power changes to maintain optimum range conditions.  

The effect of altitude on the range of a propeller-driven  aircraft is illustrated in  Figure 11-13.  A flight conducted at  high altitude has a greater true airspeed (TAS), and the power  required is proportionately greater than when conducted at  sea level. The drag of the aircraft at altitude is the same as the  drag at sea level, but the higher TAS causes a proportionately  greater power required.  

NOTE: The straight line that is tangent to the sea level power  curve is also tangent to the altitude power curve.  

The effect of altitude on specific range can also be appreciated  from the previous relationships. If a change in altitude causes  identical changes in speed and power required, the proportion  of speed to power required would be unchanged. The fact  implies that the specific range of a propeller-driven aircraft  would be unaffected by altitude. Actually, this is true to the  extent that specific fuel consumption and propeller efficiency  are the principal factors that could cause a variation of  specific range with altitude. If compressibility effects are  negligible, any variation of specific range with altitude is  strictly a function of engine/propeller performance.  

An aircraft equipped with a reciprocating engine experiences  very little, if any, variation of specific range up to its  absolute altitude. There is negligible variation of brake

specific fuel consumption for values of brake horsepower  below the maximum cruise power rating of the engine that  is the lean range of engine operation. Thus, an increase in  altitude produces a decrease in specific range only when the  increased power requirement exceeds the maximum cruise  power rating of the engine. One advantage of supercharging  is that the cruise power may be maintained at high altitude,  and the aircraft may achieve the range at high altitude with  the corresponding increase in TAS. The principal differences  in the high altitude cruise and low altitude cruise are the TAS  and climb fuel requirements.  

# Region of Reversed Command  

The aerodynamic properties of an aircraft generally determine  the power requirements at various conditions of flight, while  the powerplant capabilities generally determine the power  available at various conditions of flight. When an aircraft  is in steady, level flight, a condition of equilibrium must  prevail. An unaccelerated condition of flight is achieved  when lift equals weight, and the powerplant is set for thrust  equal to drag. The power required to achieve equilibrium in  constant-altitude flight at various airspeeds is depicted on a  power required curve. The power required curve illustrates  the fact that at low airspeeds near the stall or minimum  controllable airspeed, the power setting required for steady,  level flight is quite high.  

Flight in the region of normal command means that while  holding a constant altitude, a higher airspeed requires a higher  power setting and a lower airspeed requires a lower power  setting. The majority of aircraft flying (climb, cruise, and  maneuvers) is conducted in the region of normal command.  

Flight in the region of reversed command means flight in  which a higher airspeed requires a lower power setting  and a lower airspeed requires a higher power setting to  hold altitude. It does not imply that a decrease in power  produces lower airspeed. The region of reversed command is  encountered in the low speed phases of flight. Flight speeds  below the speed for maximum endurance (lowest point  on the power curve) require higher power settings with a  decrease in airspeed. Since the need to increase the required  power setting with decreased speed is contrary to the normal  command of flight, the regime of flight speeds between the  speed for minimum required power setting and the stall speed  (or minimum control speed) is termed the region of reversed  command. In the region of reversed command, a decrease in  airspeed must be accompanied by an increased power setting  in order to maintain steady flight.  

Figure 11-14  shows the maximum power available as a  curved line. Lower power settings, such as cruise power,  would also appear in a similar curve. The lowest point on  

![](images/fd21d96930fea8f4d28b258c5459c758c0974703a0c8ff8c36c5212853fd4969.jpg)  
Figure 11-14.  Power required curve.  

the power required curve represents the speed at which the  lowest brake horsepower sustains level flight. This is termed  the best endurance airspeed.  

An airplane performing a low airspeed, high pitch attitude  power approach for a short-field landing is an example  of operating in the region of reversed command. If an  unacceptably high sink rate should develop, it may be  possible for the pilot to reduce or stop the descent by applying  power. But without further use of power, the airplane would  probably stall or be incapable of flaring for the landing.  Merely lowering the nose of the airplane to regain flying  speed in this situation, without the use of power, would  result in a rapid sink rate and corresponding loss of altitude.  

If during a soft-field takeoff and climb, for example, the pilot  attempts to climb out of ground effect without first attaining  normal climb pitch attitude and airspeed, the airplane may  inadvertently enter the region of reversed command at a  dangerously low altitude. Even with full power, the airplane  may be incapable of climbing or even maintaining altitude.  The pilot’s only recourse in this situation is to lower the pitch  attitude in order to increase airspeed, which inevitably results  in a loss of altitude.  

Airplane pilots must give particular attention to precise  control of airspeed when operating in the low flight speeds  of the region of reversed command.  

# Takeoff and Landing Performance  

The majority of pilot-caused aircraft accidents occur during  the takeoff and landing phase of flight. Because of this fact,  the pilot must be familiar with all the variables that influence  the takeoff and landing performance of an aircraft and must  strive for exacting, professional procedures of operation  during these phases of flight.  

Takeoff and landing performance is a condition of  accelerated and decelerated motion. For instance, during  takeoff an aircraft starts at zero speed and accelerates to  the takeoff speed to become airborne. During landing, the  aircraft touches down at the landing speed and decelerates  to zero speed. The important factors of takeoff or landing  performance are:  

•	 The takeoff or landing speed is generally a function  of the stall speed or minimum flying speed. •	 The rate of acceleration/deceleration during the  takeoff or landing roll. The speed (acceleration and  deceleration) experienced by any object varies directly  with the imbalance of force and inversely with the  mass of the object. An airplane on the runway moving  at 75 knots has four times the energy it has traveling  at 37 knots. Thus, an airplane requires four times as  much distance to stop as required at half the speed. •	 The takeoff or landing roll distance is a function of  both acceleration/deceleration and speed.  

# Runway Surface and Gradient  

Runway conditions affect takeoff and landing performance.  Typically, performance chart information assumes paved,  level, smooth, and dry runway surfaces. Since no two  runways are alike, the runway surface differs from one  runway to another, as does the runway gradient or slope.  [Figure 11-15]  

Runway surfaces vary widely from one airport to another.  The runway surface encountered may be concrete, asphalt,  gravel, dirt, or grass. The runway surface for a specific  airport is noted in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly  Airport/Facility Directory). Any surface that is not hard  and smooth increases the ground roll during takeoff. This  is due to the inability of the tires to roll smoothly along the  runway. Tires can sink into soft, grassy, or muddy runways.  Potholes or other ruts in the pavement can be the cause of  poor tire movement along the runway. Obstructions such  as mud, snow, or standing water reduce the airplane’s  acceleration down the runway. Although muddy and wet  surface conditions can reduce friction between the runway  and the tires, they can also act as obstructions and reduce  the landing distance.  [Figure 11-16]  Braking effectiveness  is another consideration when dealing with various runway  types. The condition of the surface affects the braking ability  of the aircraft.  

The amount of power that is applied to the brakes without  skidding the tires is referred to as braking effectiveness.  Ensure that runways are adequate in length for takeoff  acceleration and landing deceleration when less than ideal  surface conditions are being reported.

Figure 11-15.  Takeoff distance chart.  

The gradient or slope of the runway is the amount of change  in runway height over the length of the runway. The gradient  is expressed as a percentage, such as a 3 percent gradient. This  means that for every 100 feet of runway length, the runway  height changes by 3 feet. A positive gradient indicates the  runway height increases, and a negative gradient indicates the  runway decreases in height. An upsloping runway impedes  acceleration and results in a longer ground run during takeoff.  However, landing on an upsloping runway typically reduces  the landing roll. A downsloping runway aids in acceleration  on takeoff resulting in shorter takeoff distances. The opposite  is true when landing, as landing on a downsloping runway  increases landing distances. Runway slope information is  contained in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/ Facility Directory).  [Figure 11-17]  

Water on the Runway and Dynamic Hydroplaning Water on the runways reduces the friction between the tires  and the ground and can reduce braking effectiveness. The  ability to brake can be completely lost when the tires are  hydroplaning because a layer of water separates the tires from  the runway surface. This is also true of braking effectiveness  when runways are covered in ice.  

When the runway is wet, the pilot may be confronted with  dynamic hydroplaning. Dynamic hydroplaning is a condition  in which the aircraft tires ride on a thin sheet of water rather  than on the runway’s surface. Because hydroplaning wheels  are not touching the runway, braking and directional control  are almost nil. To help minimize dynamic hydroplaning,  some runways are grooved to help drain off water; most  runways are not.  

![](images/62b3814c53c7e4dc30796aef61c5d743dfe1ed76091f32ac4615f9086c118196.jpg)  
Figure 11-16.  An aircraft’s performance during takeoff depends greatly on the runway surface.

Figure 11-17.  Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) information.  

Tire pressure is a factor in dynamic hydroplaning. Using  the simple formula in  Figure 11-18,  a pilot can calculate  the minimum speed, in knots, at which hydroplaning begins.  In plain language, the minimum hydroplaning speed is  determined by multiplying the square root of the main gear  tire pressure in psi by nine. For example, if the main gear tire  pressure is at 36 psi, the aircraft would begin hydroplaning  at 54 knots.  

Landing at higher than recommended touchdown speeds  exposes the aircraft to a greater potential for hydroplaning.  And once hydroplaning starts, it can continue well below the  minimum initial hydroplaning speed.  

On wet runways, directional control can be maximized  by landing into the wind. Abrupt control inputs should be  avoided. When the runway is wet, anticipate braking problems  

![](images/2a24aae429ac555574b200e64553fc412a09d112fc169695beca99d0c297582d.jpg)

well before landing and be prepared for hydroplaning. Opt for  a suitable runway most aligned with the wind. Mechanical  braking may be ineffective, so aerodynamic braking should  be used to its fullest advantage.  

# Takeoff Performance  

The minimum takeoff distance is of primary interest in  the operation of any aircraft because it defines the runway  requirements. The minimum takeoff distance is obtained by  taking off at some minimum safe speed that allows sufficient  margin above stall and provides satisfactory control and  initial ROC. Generally, the lift-off speed is some fixed  percentage of the stall speed or minimum control speed for  the aircraft in the takeoff configuration. As such, the lift-off is  accomplished at some particular value of lift coefficient and  AOA. Depending on the aircraft characteristics, the lift-off  speed is anywhere from 1.05 to 1.25 times the stall speed or  minimum control speed.  

To obtain minimum takeoff distance at the specific lift-off  speed, the forces that act on the aircraft must provide the  maximum acceleration during the takeoff roll. The various  forces acting on the aircraft may or may not be under the  control of the pilot, and various procedures may be necessary  in certain aircraft to maintain takeoff acceleration at the  highest value.  

The powerplant thrust is the principal force to provide the  acceleration and, for minimum takeoff distance, the output  thrust should be at a maximum. Lift and drag are produced  as soon as the aircraft has speed, and the values of lift and  drag depend on the AOA and dynamic pressure.  

As discussed in Chapter 6, engine pressure ratio (EPR) is the  ratio between exhaust pressure (jet blast) and inlet (static)  pressure on a turbo jet or turbo fan engine. An EPR gauge  tells the pilot how much power the engines are generating.  The higher the EPR, the higher the engine thrust. EPR is  used to avoid over-boosting an engine and to set takeoff and  go around power if needed. This information is important to  know before taking off as it helps determine the performance  of the aircraft.  

In addition to the important factors of proper procedures,  many other variables affect the takeoff performance of an  aircraft. Any item that alters the takeoff speed or acceleration  rate during the takeoff roll affects the takeoff distance.  

For example, the effect of gross weight on takeoff distance  is significant, and proper consideration of this item must be  made in predicting the aircraft’s takeoff distance. Increased  gross weight can be considered to produce a threefold effect  on takeoff performance:  

1. 	 Higher lift-off speed 2. 	 Greater mass to accelerate 3. 	 Increased retarding force (drag and ground friction)  

If the gross weight increases, a greater speed is necessary to  produce the greater lift necessary to get the aircraft airborne  at the takeoff lift coefficient. As an example of the effect of  a change in gross weight, a 21 percent increase in takeoff  weight requires a 10 percent increase in lift-off speed to  support the greater weight.  

A change in gross weight changes the net accelerating force  and changes the mass that is being accelerated. If the aircraft  has a relatively high thrust-to-weight ratio, the change in the  net accelerating force is slight and the principal effect on  acceleration is due to the change in mass.  

For example, a 10 percent increase in takeoff gross weight  would cause:  

•	 A 5 percent increase in takeoff velocity •	 At least a 9 percent decrease in rate of acceleration •	 At least a 21 percent increase in takeoff distance  

With ISA conditions, increasing the takeoff weight of the  average Cessna 182 from 2,400 pounds to 2,700 pounds (11  percent increase) results in an increased takeoff distance from  440 feet to 575 feet (23 percent increase).  

For the aircraft with a high thrust-to-weight ratio, the increase  in takeoff distance might be approximately 21 to 22 percent,  but for the aircraft with a relatively low thrust-to-weight  ratio, the increase in takeoff distance would be approximately  25 to 30 percent. Such a powerful effect requires proper  consideration of gross weight in predicting takeoff distance.  

The effect of wind on takeoff distance is large, and proper  consideration must also be provided when predicting takeoff  distance. The effect of a headwind is to allow the aircraft to  reach the lift-off speed at a lower groundspeed, while the  effect of a tailwind is to require the aircraft to achieve a  greater groundspeed to attain the lift-off speed.  

A headwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff airspeed reduces  the takeoff distance approximately 19 percent. However, a  tailwind that is 10 percent of the takeoff airspeed increases  the takeoff distance approximately 21 percent. In the case  where the headwind speed is 50 percent of the takeoff speed,  the takeoff distance would be approximately 25 percent of  the zero wind takeoff distance (75 percent reduction).  

The effect of wind on landing distance is identical to its  effect on takeoff distance.  Figure 11-19  illustrates the general  effect of wind by the percent change in takeoff or landing  distance as a function of the ratio of wind velocity to takeoff  or landing speed.  

The effect of proper takeoff speed is especially important  when runway lengths and takeoff distances are critical. The  takeoff speeds specified in the AFM/POH are generally  the minimum safe speeds at which the aircraft can become  airborne. Any attempt to take off below the recommended  speed means that the aircraft could stall, be difficult to  control, or have a very low initial ROC. In some cases, an  

![](images/bc0ff2ce009d7fc18d976603f94d056edf6bdd4bef6cc149fbc25945b7f19ae9.jpg)  
Figure 11-19.   Effect of wind on takeoff and landing.  

excessive AOA may not allow the aircraft to climb out of  ground effect. On the other hand, an excessive airspeed at  takeoff may improve the initial ROC and “feel” of the aircraft  but produces an undesirable increase in takeoff distance.  Assuming that the acceleration is essentially unaffected, the  takeoff distance varies with the square of the takeoff velocity.  

Thus, ten percent excess airspeed would increase the takeoff  distance 21 percent. In most critical takeoff conditions, such  an increase in takeoff distance would be prohibitive, and the  pilot must adhere to the recommended takeoff speeds.  

The effect of pressure altitude and ambient temperature  is to define the density altitude and its effect on takeoff  performance. While subsequent corrections are appropriate  for the effect of temperature on certain items of powerplant  performance, density altitude defines specific effects on  takeoff performance. An increase in density altitude can  produce a twofold effect on takeoff performance:  

1. 	 Greater takeoff speed 2. 	 Decreased thrust and reduced net accelerating force  

If an aircraft of given weight and configuration is operated at  greater heights above standard sea level, the aircraft requires  the same dynamic pressure to become airborne at the takeoff  lift coefficient. Thus, the aircraft at altitude takes off at the  same indicated airspeed (IAS) as at sea level, but because of  the reduced air density, the TAS is greater.  

The effect of density altitude on powerplant thrust depends  much on the type of powerplant. An increase in altitude  above standard sea level brings an immediate decrease in  power output for the unsupercharged reciprocating engine.  However, an increase in altitude above standard sea level does  not cause a decrease in power output for the supercharged  reciprocating engine until the altitude exceeds the critical  operating altitude. For those powerplants that experience  a decay in thrust with an increase in altitude, the effect  on the net accelerating force and acceleration rate can be  approximated by assuming a direct variation with density.  Actually, this assumed variation would closely approximate  the effect on aircraft with high thrust-to-weight ratios.  

Proper accounting of pressure altitude and temperature is  mandatory for accurate prediction of takeoff roll distance.  The most critical conditions of takeoff performance are the  result of some combination of high gross weight, altitude,  temperature, and unfavorable wind. In all cases, the pilot  must make an accurate prediction of takeoff distance from  the performance data of the AFM/POH, regardless of the  runway available, and strive for a polished, professional  takeoff procedure.  

In the prediction of takeoff distance from the AFM/POH  data, the following primary considerations must be given:  

•	 Pressure altitude and temperature—to define the effect  of density altitude on distance  •	 Gross weight—a large effect on distance  •	 Wind—a large effect due to the wind or wind  component along the runway  •	 Runway slope and condition—the effect of an incline  and retarding effect of factors such as snow or ice  

# Landing Performance  

In many cases, the landing distance of an aircraft defines the  runway requirements for flight operations. The minimum  landing distance is obtained by landing at some minimum safe  speed, that allows sufficient margin above stall and provides  satisfactory control and capability for a go-around. Generally,  the landing speed is some fixed percentage of the stall speed  or minimum control speed for the aircraft in the landing  configuration. As such, the landing is accomplished at some  particular value of lift coefficient and AOA. The exact values  depend on the aircraft characteristics but, once defined, the  values are independent of weight, altitude, and wind.  

To obtain minimum landing distance at the specified landing  speed, the forces that act on the aircraft must provide  maximum deceleration during the landing roll. The forces  acting on the aircraft during the landing roll may require  various procedures to maintain landing deceleration at the  peak value.  

A distinction should be made between the procedures for  minimum landing distance and an ordinary landing roll  with considerable excess runway available. Minimum  landing distance is obtained by creating a continuous peak  deceleration of the aircraft; that is, extensive use of the brakes  for maximum deceleration. On the other hand, an ordinary  landing roll with considerable excess runway may allow  extensive use of aerodynamic drag to minimize wear and tear  on the tires and brakes. If aerodynamic drag is sufficient to  cause deceleration, it can be used in deference to the brakes  in the early stages of the landing roll (i.e., brakes and tires  suffer from continuous hard use, but aircraft aerodynamic  drag is free and does not wear out with use). The use of  aerodynamic drag is applicable only for deceleration to 60  or 70 percent of the touchdown speed. At speeds less than  60 to 70 percent of the touchdown speed, aerodynamic drag  is so slight as to be of little use, and braking must be utilized  to produce continued deceleration. Since the objective during  the landing roll is to decelerate, the powerplant thrust should  be the smallest possible positive value (or largest possible  negative value in the case of thrust reversers).  

In addition to the important factors of proper procedures,  many other variables affect the landing performance. Any  item that alters the landing speed or deceleration rate during  the landing roll affects the landing distance.  

The effect of gross weight on landing distance is one of the  principal items determining the landing distance. One effect  of an increased gross weight is that a greater speed is required  to support the aircraft at the landing AOA and lift coefficient.  For an example of the effect of a change in gross weight, a  21 percent increase in landing weight requires a ten percent  increase in landing speed to support the greater weight.  

When minimum landing distances are considered, braking  friction forces predominate during the landing roll and, for  the majority of aircraft configurations, braking friction is the  main source of deceleration.  

The minimum landing distance varies in direct proportion  to the gross weight. For example, a ten percent increase in  gross weight at landing would cause a:  

•	 Five percent increase in landing velocity •	 Ten percent increase in landing distance  

A contingency of this is the relationship between weight and  braking friction force.  

The effect of wind on landing distance is large and deserves  proper consideration when predicting landing distance. Since  the aircraft lands at a particular airspeed independent of the  wind, the principal effect of wind on landing distance is  the change in the groundspeed at which the aircraft touches  down. The effect of wind on deceleration during the landing  is identical to the effect on acceleration during the takeoff.  

The effect of pressure altitude and ambient temperature is to  define density altitude and its effect on landing performance.  An increase in density altitude increases the landing speed  but does not alter the net retarding force. Thus, the aircraft  at altitude lands at the same IAS as at sea level but, because  of the reduced density, the TAS is greater. Since the aircraft  lands at altitude with the same weight and dynamic pressure,  the drag and braking friction throughout the landing roll have  the same values as at sea level. As long as the condition is  within the capability of the brakes, the net retarding force  is unchanged, and the deceleration is the same as with the  landing at sea level. Since an increase in altitude does not  alter deceleration, the effect of density altitude on landing  distance is due to the greater TAS.  

The minimum landing distance at 5,000 feet is 16 percent  greater than the minimum landing distance at sea level. The  approximate increase in landing distance with altitude is  approximately three and one-half percent for each 1,000 feet  of altitude. Proper accounting of density altitude is necessary  to accurately predict landing distance.  

The effect of proper landing speed is important when runway  lengths and landing distances are critical. The landing speeds  specified in the AFM/POH are generally the minimum safe  speeds at which the aircraft can be landed. Any attempt to  land at below the specified speed may mean that the aircraft  may stall, be difficult to control, or develop high rates of  descent. On the other hand, an excessive speed at landing may  improve the controllability slightly (especially in crosswinds)  but causes an undesirable increase in landing distance.  

A ten percent excess landing speed causes at least a 21  percent increase in landing distance. The excess speed  places a greater working load on the brakes because of the  additional kinetic energy to be dissipated. Also, the additional  speed causes increased drag and lift in the normal ground  attitude, and the increased lift reduces the normal force on  the braking surfaces. The deceleration during this range of  speed immediately after touchdown may suffer, and it is more  probable for a tire to be blown out from braking at this point.  

The most critical conditions of landing performance are  combinations of high gross weight, high density altitude,  and unfavorable wind. These conditions produce the greatest  required landing distances and critical levels of energy  dissipation on the brakes. In all cases, it is necessary to  make an accurate prediction of minimum landing distance to  compare with the available runway. A polished, professional  landing procedure is necessary because the landing phase of  flight accounts for more pilot-caused aircraft accidents than  any other single phase of flight.  

In the prediction of minimum landing distance from the  AFM/POH data, the following considerations must be given:  

•	 Pressure altitude and temperature—to define the effect  of density altitude •	 Gross weight—which defines the CAS for landing •	 Wind—a large effect due to wind or wind component  along the runway •	 Runway slope and condition—relatively small  correction for ordinary values of runway slope, but a  significant effect of snow, ice, or soft ground  

A tail wind of ten knots increases the landing distance by  about 21 percent. An increase of landing speed by ten percent  increases the landing distance by 20 percent. Hydroplaning  makes braking ineffective until a decrease of speed that can  be determined by using  Figure 11-18 .  

For instance, a pilot is downwind for runway 18, and the  tower asks if runway 27 could be accepted. There is a light  rain and the winds are out of the east at ten knots. The pilot  accepts because he or she is approaching the extended  centerline of runway 27. The turn is tight and the pilot must  descend (dive) to get to runway 27. After becoming aligned  with the runway and at 50 feet AGL, the pilot is already 1,000  feet down the 3,500 feet runway. The airspeed is still high  by about ten percent (should be at 70 knots and is at about  80 knots). The wind of ten knots is blowing from behind.  

First, the airspeed being high by about ten percent (80 knots  versus 70 knots), as presented in the performance chapter,  results in a 20 percent increase in the landing distance.  In performance planning, the pilot determined that at 70  knots the distance would be 1,600 feet. However, now it  is increased by 20 percent and the required distance is now  1,920 feet.  

The newly revised landing distance of 1,920 feet is also  affected by the wind. In looking at  Figure 11-19 , the affect  of the wind is an additional 20 percent for every ten miles  per hour (mph) in wind. This is computed not on the original  estimate but on the estimate based upon the increased  airspeed. Now the landing distance is increased by another  320 feet for a total requirement of 2,240 feet to land the  airplane after reaching 50 feet AGL.  

That is the original estimate of 1,600 under planned conditions  plus the additional 640 feet for excess speed and the tailwind.  Given the pilot overshot the threshhold by 1,000 feet, the  total length required is 3,240 on a 3,500 foot runway; 260  feet to spare. But this is in a perfect environment. Most pilots  become fearful as the end of the runway is facing them just  ahead. A typical pilot reaction is to brake—and brake hard.  Because the aircraft does not have antilock braking features  like a car, the brakes lock, and the aircraft hydroplanes on  the wet surface of the runway until decreasing to a speed of  about 54 knots (the square root of the tire pressure   $({\sqrt{36}})\;\times$  9). Braking is ineffective when hydroplaning.  

The 260 feet that a pilot might feel is left over has long since  evaporated as the aircraft hydroplaned the first 300–500 feet  when the brakes locked. This is an example of a true story,  but one which only changes from year to year because of new  participants and aircraft with different N-numbers.  

In this example, the pilot actually made many bad decisions.  Bad decisions, when combined, have a synergy greater  than the individual errors. Therefore, the corrective  actions become larger and larger until correction is almost  impossible. Aeronautical decision-making is discussed more  fully in Chapter 2, Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM).  

# Performance Speeds  

True airspeed (TAS)—the speed of the aircraft in relation to  the air mass in which it is flying.  

Indicated airspeed (IAS)—the speed of the aircraft as  observed on the ASI. It is the airspeed without correction for  indicator, position (or installation), or compressibility errors.  

Calibrated airspeed (CAS)—the ASI reading corrected for  position (or installation) and instrument errors. (CAS is  equal to TAS at sea level in standard atmosphere.) The color  coding for various design speeds marked on ASIs may be  IAS or CAS.  

Equivalent airspeed (EAS)—the ASI reading corrected  for position (or installation), for instrument error, and for  adiabatic compressible flow for the particular altitude. (EAS  is equal to CAS at sea level in standard atmosphere.)  

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S0}}$  —the calibrated power-off stalling speed or the minimum  steady flight speed at which the aircraft is controllable in the  landing configuration.  

$\mathrm{V}_{S1}$  —the calibrated power-off stalling speed or the minimum  steady flight speed at which the aircraft is controllable in a  specified configuration.  

$\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  —the speed at which the aircraft obtains the maximum  increase in altitude per unit of time. This best ROC speed  normally decreases slightly with altitude.  

$\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{X}}$  —the speed at which the aircraft obtains the highest  altitude in a given horizontal distance. This best AOC speed  normally increases slightly with altitude.  

$\mathrm{V_{LE}}$  —the maximum speed at which the aircraft can be safely  flown with the landing gear extended. This is a problem  involving stability and controllability.  

$\mathrm{V_{LO}}$  —the maximum speed at which the landing gear can  be safely extended or retracted. This is a problem involving  the air loads imposed on the operating mechanism during  extension or retraction of the gear.  

$\mathrm{V_{FE}}$  —the highest speed permissible with the wing flaps in a  prescribed extended position. This is because of the air loads  imposed on the structure of the flaps.  

$\mathrm{V_{A}}$  —the calibrated design maneuvering airspeed. This is  the maximum speed at which the limit load can be imposed  (either by gusts or full deflection of the control surfaces)  without causing structural damage. Operating at or below  maneuvering speed does not provide structural protection  against multiple full control inputs in one axis or full control  inputs in more than one axis at the same time.  

$\mathrm{V_{N0}}$  —the maximum speed for normal operation or the  maximum structural cruising speed. This is the speed at  which exceeding the limit load factor may cause permanent  deformation of the aircraft structure.  

$\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  —the speed that should  never  be exceeded. If flight is  attempted above this speed, structural damage or structural  failure may result.  

# Performance Charts  

Performance charts allow a pilot to predict the takeoff, climb,  cruise, and landing performance of an aircraft. These charts,  provided by the manufacturer, are included in the AFM/POH.  Information the manufacturer provides on these charts has  been gathered from test flights conducted in a new aircraft,  under normal operating conditions while using average  piloting skills, and with the aircraft and engine in good  working order. Engineers record the flight data and create  performance charts based on the behavior of the aircraft  during the test flights. By using these performance charts,  a pilot can determine the runway length needed to take off  and land, the amount of fuel to be used during flight, and the  time required to arrive at the destination. It is important to  remember that the data from the charts will not be accurate  if the aircraft is not in good working order or when operating  under adverse conditions. Always consider the necessity to  compensate for the performance numbers if the aircraft is not  in good working order or piloting skills are below average.  

Each aircraft performs differently and, therefore, has different  performance numbers. Compute the performance of the  aircraft prior to every flight, as every flight is different. (See  appendix for examples of performance charts for a Cessna  Model 172R and Challenger 605.)  

Every chart is based on certain conditions and contains  notes on how to adapt the information for flight conditions.  It is important to read every chart and understand how to  use it. Read the instructions provided by the manufacturer.  For an explanation on how to use the charts, refer to the  example provided by the manufacturer for that specific chart.  [Figure 11-20]  

The information manufacturers furnish is not standardized.  Information may be contained in a table format and  other information may be contained in a graph format.  Sometimes combined graphs incorporate two or more graphs  into one chart to compensate for multiple conditions of  flight. Combined graphs allow the pilot to predict aircraft  performance for variations in density altitude, weight,  and winds all on one chart. Because of the vast amount of  information that can be extracted from this type of chart, it  is important to be very accurate in reading the chart. A small  error in the beginning can lead to a large error at the end.  

The remainder of this section covers performance information  for aircraft in general and discusses what information the  charts contain and how to extract information from the charts  by direct reading and interpolation methods. Every chart  contains a wealth of information that should be used when  flight planning. Examples of the table, graph, and combined  graph formats for all aspects of flight are discussed.

Figure 11-20.  Conditions notes chart.  

# Interpolation  

Not all of the information on the charts is easily extracted.  Some charts require interpolation to find the information for  specific flight conditions. Interpolating information means  that by taking the known information, a pilot can compute  intermediate information. However, pilots sometimes round  off values from charts to a more conservative figure.  

Using values that reflect slightly more adverse conditions  provides a reasonable estimate of performance information  and gives a slight margin of safety. The following illustration  is an example of interpolating information from a takeoff  distance chart.  [Figure 11-21]  

# Density Altitude Charts  

Use a density altitude chart to figure the density altitude at the  departing airport. Using  Figure 11-22 , determine the density  altitude based on the given information.  

# Sample Problem 1  

Airport Elevation...............................................5,883 feet OAT..........................................................................  $.70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Altimeter...........................................................30.10 "Hg  

First, compute the pressure altitude conversion. Find 30.10  under the altimeter heading. Read across to the second  column. It reads “–165.” Therefore, it is necessary to subtract  165 from the airport elevation giving a pressure altitude of  5,718 feet. Next, locate the outside air temperature on the  scale along the bottom of the graph. From  $70^{\circ}$  , draw a line up  to the 5,718 feet pressure altitude line, which is about two- thirds of the way up between the 5,000 and 6,000 foot lines.  Draw a line straight across to the far left side of the graph  and read the approximate density altitude. The approximate  density altitude in thousands of feet is 7,700 feet.  

# Takeoff Charts  

Takeoff charts are typically provided in several forms and  allow a pilot to compute the takeoff distance of the aircraft  with no flaps or with a specific flap configuration. A pilot can  also compute distances for a no flap takeoff over a 50 foot  obstacle scenario, as well as with flaps over a 50 foot obstacle.  The takeoff distance chart provides for various aircraft  weights, altitudes, temperatures, winds, and obstacle heights.  

# Sample Problem 2  

Pressure Altitude...............................................2,000 feet OAT.........................................................................  $.22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Takeoff Weight.............................................2,600 pounds Headwind...............................................................6 knots Obstacle Height.......................................50 foot obstacle  

Refer to  Figure 11-23 . This chart is an example of a combined  takeoff distance graph. It takes into consideration pressure  altitude, temperature, weight, wind, and obstacles all on one  chart. First, find the correct temperature on the bottom left  side of the graph. Follow the line from  $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   straight up until  it intersects the 2,000 foot altitude line. From that point, draw  a line straight across to the first dark reference line. Continue  to draw the line from the reference point in a diagonal  direction following the surrounding lines until it intersects  the corresponding weight line. From the intersection of 2,600  pounds, draw a line straight across until it reaches the second  reference line. Once again, follow the lines in a diagonal  manner until it reaches the six knot headwind mark. Follow  

![](images/c07a5dc863dd9e02b4411dba00ab132fcad77832bb4128492464831e976ce42f.jpg)  

To find the takeoff distance for a pressure altitude of 2,500 feet  at   $\sf{20~^{\circ}C}$  , average the ground roll for 2,000 feet and 3,000 feet.  $\begin{array}{r l}{\frac{1,115+1,\!230}{2}}&{{}=1,\!173\,\mathsf{f e e t}}\end{array}$  

![](images/e03ba4864b863cdcd7828d70f5b1de33c134cb3bd35d13c9450069dc9afe5bb2.jpg)  
Figure 11-22.  Density altitude chart.  

straight across to the third reference line and from here, draw  a line in two directions. First, draw a line straight across to  figure the ground roll distance. Next, follow the diagonal lines  again until they reach the corresponding obstacle height. In  this case, it is a 50 foot obstacle. Therefore, draw the diagonal  line to the far edge of the chart. This results in a 700 foot  ground roll distance and a total distance of 1,400 feet over a  50 foot obstacle. To find the corresponding takeoff speeds  at lift-off and over the 50 foot obstacle, refer to the table on  the top of the chart. In this case, the lift-off speed at 2,600  pounds would be 63 knots and over the 50 foot obstacle  would be 68 knots.  

# Sample Problem 3  

Pressure Altitude...............................................3,000 feet OAT........................................................................  $.30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Takeoff Weight............................................2,400 pounds Headwind............................................................18 knots  

Refer to  Figure 11-24 . This chart is an example of a takeoff  distance table for short-field takeoffs. For this table, first find  the takeoff weight. Once at 2,400 pounds, begin reading from  left to right across the table. The takeoff speed is in the second  column and, in the third column under pressure altitude, find  the pressure altitude of 3,000 feet. Carefully follow that line  to the right until it is under the correct temperature column  of  $30\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The ground roll total reads 1,325 feet and the total  required to clear a 50 foot obstacle is 2,480 feet. At this point,  there is an 18 knot headwind. According to the notes section  under point number two, decrease the distances by ten percent  for each 9 knots of headwind. With an 18 knot headwind, it  is necessary to decrease the distance by 20 percent. Multiply  1,325 feet by 20 percent (  $^{1,325\ \times}$   .  $20=265)$  ), subtract the  product from the total distance   $(1,325-265=1,060)$  ). Repeat  this process for the total distance over a 50 foot obstacle. The  ground roll distance is 1,060 feet and the total distance over  a 50 foot obstacle is 1,984 feet.  

# Climb and Cruise Charts  

Climb and cruise chart information is based on actual flight  tests conducted in an aircraft of the same type. This information  is extremely useful when planning a cross-country flight to  predict the performance and fuel consumption of the aircraft.  Manufacturers produce several different charts for climb and  cruise performance. These charts include everything from  fuel, time, and distance to climb to best power setting during  cruise to cruise range performance.  

The first chart to check for climb performance is a fuel,  time, and distance-to-climb chart. This chart gives the fuel  amount used during the climb, the time it takes to accomplish  the climb, and the ground distance that is covered during  the climb. To use this chart, obtain the information for  the departing airport and for the cruise altitude. Using  Figure 11-25,  calculate the fuel, time, and distance to climb  based on the information provided.  

# Sample Problem 4  

Departing Airport Pressure Altitude.................6,000 feet Departing Airport OAT...........................................  $.25~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Cruise Pressure Altitude..................................10,000 feet  Cruise OAT.............................................................  $10~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$

Figure 11-25.  Fuel, time, and distance climb chart.  

First, find the information for the departing airport. Find the  OAT for the departing airport along the bottom, left side of the  graph. Follow the line from  $25\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   straight up until it intersects  the line corresponding to the pressure altitude of 6,000 feet.  Continue this line straight across until it intersects all three  lines for fuel, time, and distance. Draw a line straight down  from the intersection of altitude and fuel, altitude and time, and  a third line at altitude and distance. It should read three and  one-half gallons of fuel, 6 minutes of time, and nine NM. Next,  repeat the steps to find the information for the cruise altitude.  It should read six gallons of fuel, 10.5 minutes of time, and   $15\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  . Take each set of numbers for fuel, time, and distance  and subtract them from one another   $6.0\,{-}\,3.5\,{=}\,2.5$   gallons of  fuel). It takes two and one-half gallons of fuel and 4 minutes  of time to climb to 10,000 feet. During that climb, the distance  covered is six NM. Remember, according to the notes at the  top of the chart, these numbers do not take into account wind,  and it is assumed maximum continuous power is being used.  

The next example is a fuel, time, and distance-to-climb table.  For this table, use the same basic criteria as for the previous  chart. However, it is necessary to figure the information in a  different manner. Refer to  Figure 11-26  to work the following  sample problem.  

# Sample Problem 5  

Departing Airport Pressure Altitude..................Sea level Departing Airport OAT...........................................  $.22\,^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  Cruise Pressure Altitude....................................8,000 feet Takeoff Weight.............................................3,400 pounds To begin, find the given weight of 3,400 in the first column of  the chart. Move across to the pressure altitude column to find  the sea level altitude numbers. At sea level, the numbers read  zero. Next, read the line that corresponds with the cruising  altitude of 8,000 feet. Normally, a pilot would subtract these  

![](images/6fd578ed4a443567ce33b59d64a032343676f63b5b3a6e6cb54851e93ac8e334.jpg)  

two sets of numbers from one another, but given the fact that  the numbers read zero at sea level, it is known that the time  to climb from sea level to 8,000 feet is 10 minutes. It is also  known that 21 pounds of fuel is used and 20 NM is covered  during the climb. However, the temperature is  $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  , which is   $7^{\circ}$   above the standard temperature of  $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The notes section  of this chart indicate that the findings must be increased by ten  percent for each  $7^{\circ}$   above standard. Multiply the findings by  ten percent or .1  $0\,(10\times.10\,{=}\,1,1+10\,{=}\,11$   minutes). After  accounting for the additional ten percent, the findings should  read 11 minutes, 23.1 pounds of fuel, and 22 NM. Notice that  the fuel is reported in pounds of fuel, not gallons. Aviation  fuel weighs six pounds per gallon, so 23.1 pounds of fuel is  equal to 3.85 gallons of fuel   $(23.1\div6=3.85)$  ).  

The next example is a cruise and range performance chart.  This type of table is designed to give TAS, fuel consumption,  endurance in hours, and range in miles at specific cruise  configurations. Use  Figure 11-27  to determine the cruise and  range performance under the given conditions.  

# Sample Problem 6  

Pressure Altitude...............................................5,000 feet RPM..................................................................2,400 rpm Fuel Carrying Capacity..................38 gallons, no reserve  

Find 5,000 feet pressure altitude in the first column on the  left side of the table. Next, find the correct rpm of 2,400  in the second column. Follow that line straight across and  read the TAS of   $116\,\mathrm{mph}$   and a fuel burn rate of 6.9 gallons  per hour. As per the example, the aircraft is equipped with  a fuel carrying capacity of 38 gallons. Under this column,  read that the endurance in hours is 5.5 hours and the range  in miles is 635 miles.  

Cruise power setting tables are useful when planning cross- country flights. The table gives the correct cruise power  settings, as well as the fuel flow and airspeed performance  numbers at that altitude and airspeed.  

# Sample Problem 7  

Pressure Altitude at Cruise................................6,000 feet  OAT.................................................  $.36\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   above standard  

Refer to  Figure 11-28  for this sample problem. First, locate  the pressure altitude of 6,000 feet on the far left side of the  table. Follow that line across to the far right side of the table  under the  $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (or   $36~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ) column. At 6,000 feet, the rpm  setting of 2,450 will maintain 65 percent continuous power  at  $21.0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{Hg}$   with a fuel flow rate of 11.5 gallons per hour and  airspeed of 161 knots.  

![Figure 11-27.  Cruise and range performance. ](images/525d70d88cf0bddc614fb4c3f20443e390e71ae0cd6bad48d97175a2060a3d66.jpg)  

Another type of cruise chart is a best power mixture range  graph. This graph gives the best range based on power  setting and altitude. Using  Figure 11-29,  find the range at  65 percent power with and without a reserve based on the  provided conditions.  

# Sample Problem 8  

OAT....................................................................Standard Pressure Altitude...............................................5,000 feet  

First, move up the left side of the graph to 5,000 feet and  standard temperature. Follow the line straight across the  graph until it intersects the 65 percent line under both the  reserve and no reserve categories. Draw a line straight down  from both intersections to the bottom of the graph. At 65  percent power with a reserve, the range is approximately  522 miles. At 65 percent power with no reserve, the range  should be 581 miles.  

The last cruise chart referenced is a cruise performance graph.  This graph is designed to tell the TAS performance of the  airplane depending on the altitude, temperature, and power  setting. Using  Figure 11-30,  find the TAS performance based  on the given information.  

![](images/b04a6ffc47e15cf6ce8a18de52750961d879340b92e50546d96d7e82aca9057c.jpg)  
1.  Full throttle manifold pressure settings are approximate. 2.         Shaded area represents operation with full throttle.

# Sample Problem 9  

OAT.........................................................................  $16~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Pressure Altitude...............................................6,000 feet Power Setting................................65 percent, best power Wheel Fairings..............................................Not installed  

Begin by finding the correct OAT on the bottom left side of  the graph. Move up that line until it intersects the pressure  altitude of 6,000 feet. Draw a line straight across to the  

![](images/c86daa5f71f7d53df18901f883837554b3cfe3487ae190e91f9e729d9643ff1b.jpg)  
Figure 11-29.  Best power mixture range.  

65 percent, best power line. This is the solid line, that  represents best economy. Draw a line straight down from  this intersection to the bottom of the graph. The TAS at 65  percent best power is 140 knots. However, it is necessary  to subtract 8 knots from the speed since there are no wheel  fairings. This note is listed under the title and conditions.  The TAS is 132 knots.  

# Crosswind and Headwind Component Chart  

Every aircraft is tested according to Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) regulations prior to certification. The  aircraft is tested by a pilot with average piloting skills in   $90^{\circ}$   crosswinds with a velocity up to  $0.2~\mathrm{V}_{S0}$   or two-tenths  of the aircraft’s stalling speed with power off, gear down,  and flaps down. This means that if the stalling speed of the  aircraft is 45 knots, it must be capable of landing in a 9-knot,   $90^{\circ}$   crosswind. The maximum demonstrated crosswind  component is published in the AFM/POH. The crosswind and  headwind component chart allows for figuring the headwind  and crosswind component for any given wind direction and  velocity.  

# Sample Problem 10  

Runway..........................................................................17 Wind........................................................  $140^{\circ}$   at 25 knots  

Refer to  Figure 11-31  to solve this problem. First, determine  how many degrees difference there is between the runway  and the wind direction. It is known that runway 17 means  a direction of   $170^{\circ}$  ; from that subtract the wind direction  of   $140^{\circ}$  . This gives a  $30^{\circ}$   angular difference or wind angle.  Next, locate the  $30^{\circ}$   mark and draw a line from there until  it intersects the correct wind velocity of 25 knots. From  

![](images/eeb652e85ff67c591a1f4be804c77fa31527133ef354a1b7bc4ac10b44b5b3a6.jpg)  
Figure 11-30.  Cruise performance graph.  

there, draw a line straight down and a line straight across.  The headwind component is 22 knots and the crosswind  component is 13 knots. This information is important when  taking off and landing so that, first of all, the appropriate  runway can be picked if more than one exists at a particular  airport, but also so that the aircraft is not pushed beyond its  tested limits.  

# Landing Charts  

Landing performance is affected by variables similar to those  affecting takeoff performance. It is necessary to compensate  for differences in density altitude, weight of the airplane, and  headwinds. Like takeoff performance charts, landing distance  information is available as normal landing information,  as well as landing distance over a 50 foot obstacle. As  

![](images/98311d88f950696f8cf217af38440a4d87b6f3a110cc4f9d532293be78a1df66.jpg)  
Figure 10-31.  Crosswind component chart.  

usual, read the associated conditions and notes in order to  ascertain the basis of the chart information. Remember, when  calculating landing distance that the landing weight is not the  same as the takeoff weight. The weight must be recalculated  to compensate for the fuel that was used during the flight.  

# Sample Problem 11  

Pressure Altitude...............................................1,250 feet Temperature.........................................................Standard  

Refer to  Figure 10-32 . This example makes use of a landing  distance table. Notice that the altitude of 1,250 feet is not  on this table. It is, therefore, necessary to interpolate to find  the correct landing distance. The pressure altitude of 1,250  is halfway between sea level and 2,500 feet. First, find the  column for sea level and the column for 2,500 feet. Take the  total distance of 1,075 for sea level and the total distance of  1,135 for 2,500 and add them together. Divide the total by  two to obtain the distance for 1,250 feet. The distance is 1,105  feet total landing distance to clear a 50 foot obstacle. Repeat  this process to obtain the ground roll distance for the pressure  altitude. The ground roll should be 457.5 feet.  

# Sample Problem 12  

OAT.......................................................................... 57 °F Pressure Altitude.............................................. 4,000 feet Landing Weight...........................................2,400 pounds Headwind.............................................................. 6 knots Obstacle Height..................................................... 50 feet  

Using the given conditions and  Figure 11-33,  determine the  landing distance for the aircraft. This graph is an example of  

![](images/bdd01e0c086123464cd136b04d92dad16d81d8c1178599e0c23925768b060c93.jpg)  
1.   Decrease the distances shown by  $10\%$   for each 4 knots of headwind. Note 2.   Increase the distance by  $10\%$   for each  $60~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   temperature increase above standard. 3.   For operation on a dry, grass runway, increase distances (both “ground roll” and “total to clear 50 ft obstacle”) by  $z0\%$   of the “total to clear 50 ft obstacle” figure.  

# Figure 11-32.  Landing distance table.  

a combined landing distance graph and allows compensation  for temperature, weight, headwinds, tailwinds, and varying  obstacle height. Begin by finding the correct OAT on the  scale on the left side of the chart. Move up in a straight  line to the correct pressure altitude of 4,000 feet. From this  intersection, move straight across to the first dark reference  line. Follow the lines in the same diagonal fashion until the  correct landing weight is reached. At 2,400 pounds, continue  in a straight line across to the second dark reference line.  Once again, draw a line in a diagonal manner to the correct  wind component and then straight across to the third dark  reference line. From this point, draw a line in two separate  directions: one straight across to figure the ground roll and  one in a diagonal manner to the correct obstacle height. This  should be 975 feet for the total ground roll and 1,500 feet for  the total distance over a 50 foot obstacle.  

# Stall Speed Performance Charts  

Stall speed performance charts are designed to give an  understanding of the speed at which the aircraft stalls in  a given configuration. This type of chart typically takes  into account the angle of bank, the position of the gear and  flaps, and the throttle position. Use  Figure   $\mathit{l l}.34$   and the  accompanying conditions to find the speed at which the  airplane stalls.  

# Sample Problem 13  

Power........................................................................ OFF Flaps....................................................................... Down  Gear........................................................................ Down Angle of Bank.............................................................  $45^{\circ}$  First, locate the correct flap and gear configuration. The  bottom half of the chart should be used since the gear and  

![](images/bea6d54908b0088eea9e3c2d6b5b67dac280377211e7b585f59cf9b00f26ee67.jpg)  
Figure 11-33.  Landing distance graph.  

![Figure 11-34.  Stall speed table. ](images/5179c85064d06c5d79049046a8f6a66f0caab9f0e9e6e45898fe7c0ca43b96c8.jpg)  

flaps are down. Next, choose the row corresponding to a  power-off situation. Now, find the correct angle of bank  column, which is   $45^{\circ}$  . The stall speed is   $78~\mathrm{mph}$  , and the  stall speed in knots would be 68 knots.  

Performance charts provide valuable information to the pilot.  By using these charts, a pilot can predict the performance of  the aircraft under most flying conditions, providing a better  plan for every flight. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)  requires that a pilot be familiar with all information available  prior to any flight. Pilots should use the information to their  advantage as it can only contribute to safety in flight.  

# Air Carrier Obstacle Clearance  Requirements  

For information on air carrier obstacle clearance  requirements consult the Instrument Procedures Handbook,  FAA-H-8083-16 (as revised).  

# Chapter Summary  

Performance characteristics and capabilities vary greatly  among aircraft. As transport aircraft become more capable  and more complex, most operators find themselves having  to rely increasingly on computerized flight mission planning  systems. These systems may be on board or used during  the planning phase of the flight. Moreover, aircraft weight,  atmospheric conditions, and external environmental factors  can significantly affect aircraft performance. It is essential  that a pilot become intimately familiar with the mission  planning programs, performance characteristics, and  capabilities of the aircraft being flown, as well as all of the  onboard computerized systems in today’s complex aircraft.  The primary source of this information is the AFM/POH.  

# Transport Category Aircraft Performance  

Transport category aircraft are certificated under Title 14  of the CFR (14 CFR) part 25. For additional information  concerning transport category airplanes, consult the Airplane  Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3 (as revised).  

Transport category helicopters are certificated under 14  CFR part 29.  

# Chapter 12 Weather Theory  

# Introduction  

Weather is an important factor that influences aircraft  performance and flying safety. It is the state of the atmosphere  at a given time and place with respect to variables, such as  temperature (heat or cold), moisture (wetness or dryness),  wind velocity (calm or storm), visibility (clearness or  cloudiness), and barometric pressure (high or low). The  term “weather” can also apply to adverse or destructive  atmospheric conditions, such as high winds.  

This chapter explains basic weather theory and offers pilots  background knowledge of weather principles. It is designed  to help them gain a good understanding of how weather  affects daily flying activities. Understanding the theories  behind weather helps a pilot make sound weather decisions  based on the reports and forecasts obtained from a Flight  Service Station (FSS) weather specialist and other aviation  weather services.  

Be it a local flight or a long cross-country flight, decisions  based on weather can dramatically affect the safety of the flight.  

# Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is a blanket of air made up of a mixture of  gases that surrounds the Earth and reaches almost 350 miles  from the surface of the Earth. This mixture is in constant  motion. If the atmosphere were visible, it might look like  an ocean with swirls and eddies, rising and falling air, and  waves that travel for great distances.  

Life on Earth is supported by the atmosphere, solar energy,  and the planet’s magnetic fields. The atmosphere absorbs  energy from the sun, recycles water and other chemicals, and  works with the electrical and magnetic forces to provide a  moderate climate. The atmosphere also protects life on Earth  from high energy radiation and the frigid vacuum of space.  

# Composition of the Atmosphere  

In any given volume of air, nitrogen accounts for 78 percent  of the gases that comprise the atmosphere, while oxygen  makes up 21 percent. Argon, carbon dioxide, and traces  of other gases make up the remaining one percent. This  volume of air also contains some water vapor, varying from  zero to about five percent by volume. This small amount of  water vapor is responsible for major changes in the weather.  [Figure 12-1]  

The envelope of gases surrounding the Earth changes  from the ground up. Four distinct layers or spheres of the  

![](images/f05878bc8f6d5cd6356e12c69fe26f1fa6e652312958e821b7390299b5860fc4.jpg)  
Figure 12-1.  Composition of the atmosphere.  

atmosphere have been identified using thermal characteristics  (temperature changes), chemical composition, movement,  and density.  [Figure 12-2]  

The first layer, known as the troposphere, extends from 6  to 20 kilometers   $(\mathrm{km})$   (4 to 12 miles) over the northern and  southern poles and up to 48,000 feet   $14.5\ \mathrm{km})$   over the  equatorial regions. The vast majority of weather, clouds,  storms, and temperature variances occur within this first  layer of the atmosphere. Inside the troposphere, the average  temperature decreases at a rate of about  $2\,^{\circ}$  Celsius (C) every

1,000 feet of altitude gain, and the pressure decreases at a rate  of about one inch per 1,000 feet of altitude gain.  

At the top of the troposphere is a boundary known as the  tropopause, which traps moisture and the associated weather  in the troposphere. The altitude of the tropopause varies with  latitude and with the season of the year; therefore, it takes  on an elliptical shape as opposed to round. Location of the  tropopause is important because it is commonly associated with  the location of the jet stream and possible clear air turbulence.  

Above the tropopause are three more atmospheric levels. The  first is the stratosphere, which extends from the tropopause to  a height of about 160,000 feet   $(50\,\mathrm{km})$  ). Little weather exists  in this layer and the air remains stable, although certain types  of clouds occasionally extend in it. Above the stratosphere  are the mesosphere and thermosphere, which have little  influence over weather.  

# Atmospheric Circulation  

As noted earlier, the atmosphere is in constant motion.  Certain factors combine to set the atmosphere in motion, but a  major factor is the uneven heating of the Earth’s surface. This  heating upsets the equilibrium of the atmosphere, creating  changes in air movement and atmospheric pressure. The  movement of air around the surface of the Earth is called  atmospheric circulation.  

Heating of the Earth’s surface is accomplished by several  processes, but in the simple convection-only model used for  this discussion, the Earth is warmed by energy radiating from  the sun. The process causes a circular motion that results  when warm air rises and is replaced by cooler air.  

Warm air rises because heat causes air molecules to spread  apart. As the air expands, it becomes less dense and lighter  than the surrounding air. As air cools, the molecules pack  together more closely, becoming denser and heavier than  warm air. As a result, cool, heavy air tends to sink and replace  warmer, rising air.  

Because the Earth has a curved surface that rotates on a tilted  axis while orbiting the sun, the equatorial regions of the Earth  receive a greater amount of heat from the sun than the polar  regions. The amount of solar energy that heats the Earth  depends on the time of year and the latitude of the specific  region. All of these factors affect the length of time and the  angle at which sunlight strikes the surface.  

Solar heating causes higher temperatures in equatorial areas,  which causes the air to be less dense and rise. As the warm  air flows toward the poles, it cools, becoming denser and  sinks back toward the surface.  [Figure 12-3]

Figure 12-3.   Circulation pattern in a static environment.  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

The unequal heating of the Earth’s surface not only modifies  air density and creates circulation patterns; it also causes  changes in air pressure or the force exerted by the weight  of air molecules. Although air molecules are invisible, they  still have weight and take up space.  

Imagine a sealed column of air that has a footprint of one  square inch and is 350 miles high. It would take 14.7 pounds  of effort to lift that column. This represents the air’s weight;  if the column is shortened, the pressure exerted at the bottom  (and its weight) would be less.  

The weight of the shortened column of air at 18,000 feet is  approximately 7.4 pounds; almost 50 percent that at sea level.  For instance, if a bathroom scale (calibrated for sea level)  were raised to 18,000 feet, the column of air weighing 14.7  pounds at sea level would be 18,000 feet shorter and would  weigh approximately 7.3 pounds (50 percent) less than at  sea level.  [Figure 12-4]  

The actual pressure at a given place and time differs with  altitude, temperature, and density of the air. These conditions  also affect aircraft performance, especially with regard to  takeoff, rate of climb, and landings.  

# Coriolis Force  

In general atmospheric circulation theory, areas of low  pressure exist over the equatorial regions and areas of high  pressure exist over the polar regions due to a difference in  temperature. The resulting low pressure allows the high- pressure air at the poles to flow along the planet’s surface  toward the equator. While this pattern of air circulation is  

![](images/1a54c6284b7fc08bacc1daf2c768a81c84e2d48b7dd5e6dd35b8636a96f70821.jpg)  
Figure 12-4.  Atmosphere weights.  

correct in theory, the circulation of air is modified by several  forces, the most important of which is the rotation of the Earth.  

The force created by the rotation of the Earth is known as  the Coriolis force. This force is not perceptible to humans as  they walk around because humans move slowly and travel  relatively short distances compared to the size and rotation  rate of the Earth. However, the Coriolis force significantly  affects motion over large distances, such as an air mass or  body of water.  

The Coriolis force deflects air to the right in the Northern  Hemisphere, causing it to follow a curved path instead of a  straight line. The amount of deflection differs depending on  the latitude. It is greatest at the poles and diminishes to zero  at the equator. The magnitude of Coriolis force also differs  with the speed of the moving body—the greater the speed,  the greater the deviation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the  rotation of the Earth deflects moving air to the right and  changes the general circulation pattern of the air.  

The Coriolis force causes the general flow to break up into  three distinct cells in each hemisphere.  [Figure 12-5]  In  the Northern Hemisphere, the warm air at the equator rises  upward from the surface, travels northward, and is deflected  eastward by the rotation of the Earth. By the time it has  traveled one-third of the distance from the equator to the  North Pole, it is no longer moving northward, but eastward.  This air cools and sinks in a belt-like area at about   $30^{\circ}$  latitude, creating an area of high pressure as it sinks toward  

![](images/4728c20d753ad1d920673c513d6400d2b8ff666a953731232c7c4c8a1134c436.jpg)  
Figure 12-5.   Three-cell circulation pattern due to the rotation of  the Earth.  

the surface. Then, it flows southward along the surface back  toward the equator. Coriolis force bends the flow to the right,  thus creating the northeasterly trade winds that prevail from   $30^{\circ}$   latitude to the equator. Similar forces create circulation  cells that encircle the Earth between  $30^{\circ}$   and  $60^{\circ}$   latitude and  between  $60^{\circ}$   and the poles. This circulation pattern results in  the prevailing upper level westerly winds in the conterminous  United States.  

Circulation patterns are further complicated by seasonal  changes, differences between the surfaces of continents and  oceans, and other factors such as frictional forces caused  by the topography of the Earth’s surface that modify the  movement of the air in the atmosphere. For example, within  2,000 feet of the ground, the friction between the surface and  the atmosphere slows the moving air. The wind is diverted  from its path because of the frictional force. Thus, the wind  direction at the surface varies somewhat from the wind  direction just a few thousand feet above the Earth.  

# Measurement of Atmosphere Pressure  

Atmospheric pressure historically was  measured in inches of  mercury  $({}^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   by a mercurial barometer.  [Figure 12-6]  The  barometer measures the height of a column of mercury inside a  glass tube. A section of the mercury is exposed to the pressure  of the atmosphere, which exerts a force on the mercury. An  increase in pressure forces the mercury to rise inside the tube.  When the pressure drops, mercury drains out of the tube  decreasing the height of the column. This type of barometer is  typically used in a laboratory or weather observation station,  is not easily transported, and difficult to read.  

![](images/819ae84d6f8c7aea7496284cf8aa257d42799a54fca7d0126f715a7f5f20f7ee.jpg)  
Figure 12-6.  Although mercurial barometers are no longer used  in the U. S., they are still a good historical reference for where the  altimeter setting came from (inches of mercury).  

An aneroid barometer is the standard instrument used  to measure pressure; it is easier to read and transport.  [Figure 12-7]  The aneroid barometer contains a closed vessel  called an aneroid cell that contracts or expands with changes  in pressure. The aneroid cell attaches to a pressure indicator  with a mechanical linkage to provide pressure readings. The  pressure sensing part of an aircraft altimeter is essentially  an aneroid barometer. It is important to note that due to  

![](images/054a3cd87c18d8c8e32911e696b1948738271bbe3e2cfff9d351b773b48a5c1b.jpg)  
Figure 12-7.  Aneroid barometer.  

the linkage mechanism of an aneroid barometer, it is not as  accurate as a mercurial barometer.  

To provide a common reference, the International Standard  Atmosphere (ISA) has been established. These standard  conditions are the basis for certain flight instruments and  most aircraft performance data. Standard sea level pressure  is defined as  $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   and a standard temperature of  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   

 (  $.15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  . Atmospheric pressure is also reported in millibars 

 (mb), with  $1\,^{\mathrm{"Hg}}$   equal to approximately  $34\,\mathrm{mb}$  . Standard sea  level pressure is   $1{,}013{.}2~\mathrm{mb}$  . Typical mb pressure readings  range from 950.0 to  $1{,}040{.}0\,\mathrm{mb}$  . Surface charts, high and low  pressure centers, and hurricane data are reported using mb.  

Since weather stations are located around the globe, all local  barometric pressure readings are converted to a sea level  pressure to provide a standard for records and reports. To  achieve this, each station converts its barometric pressure by  adding approximately  $1\,^{\mathrm{"Hg}}$   for every 1,000 feet of elevation.  For example, a station at 5,000 feet above sea level, with a  reading of  $24.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  , reports a sea level pressure reading of   $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .  [Figure 12-8]  Using common sea level pressure  readings helps ensure aircraft altimeters are set correctly,  based on the current pressure readings.  

By tracking barometric pressure trends across a large area,  weather forecasters can more accurately predict movement  of pressure systems and the associated weather. For example,  tracking a pattern of rising pressure at a single weather station  generally indicates the approach of fair weather. Conversely,  decreasing or rapidly falling pressure usually indicates  approaching bad weather and, possibly, severe storms.  

# Altitude and Atmospheric Pressure  

As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. On  average, with every 1,000 feet of increase in altitude, the  atmospheric pressure decreases 1 "Hg. As pressure decreases,  the air becomes less dense or thinner. This is the equivalent of  being at a higher altitude and is referred to as density altitude.  As pressure decreases, density altitude increases and has a  pronounced effect on aircraft performance.  

Differences in air density caused by changes in temperature  result in a change in pressure. This, in turn, creates motion in  the atmosphere, both vertically and horizontally, in the form  of currents and wind. The atmosphere is almost constantly in  motion as it strives to reach equilibrium. These never-ending  air movements set up chain reactions that cause a continuing  variety in the weather.  

![](images/8386e6daf3590c8a6c1d037644150ae4d3841769d5da09f6db4b2c8560e97814.jpg)  
Figure 12-8.  Station pressure is converted to and reported in sea level pressure.  

# Altitude and Flight  

Altitude affects every aspect of flight from aircraft  performance to human performance. At higher altitudes,  with a decreased atmospheric pressure, takeoff and landing  distances are increased, while climb rates decrease.  

When an aircraft takes off, lift is created by the flow of air  around the wings. If the air is thin, more speed is required  to obtain enough lift for takeoff; therefore, the ground run  is longer. An aircraft that requires 745 feet of ground run at  sea level requires more than double that at a pressure altitude  of 8,000 feet.  [Figure 12-9] . It is also true that at higher  altitudes, due to the decreased density of the air, aircraft  engines and propellers are less efficient. This leads to reduced  rates of climb and a greater ground run for obstacle clearance.  

# Altitude and the Human Body  

As discussed earlier, nitrogen and other trace gases make  up 79 percent of the atmosphere, while the remaining 21  

![](images/a5e66d0ab1cefb33f62aa22a2ab3b089a8153205f83e3817f1d5138b10815e11.jpg)  
Figure 12-9.  Takeoff distances increase with increased altitude.  

percent is life sustaining atmospheric oxygen. At sea level,  atmospheric pressure is great enough to support normal  growth, activity, and life. By 18,000 feet, the partial pressure  of oxygen is reduced and adversely affects the normal  activities and functions of the human body.  

The reactions of the average person become impaired at an  altitude of about 10,000 feet, but for some people impairment  can occur at an altitude as low as 5,000 feet. The physiological  reactions to hypoxia or oxygen deprivation are insidious and  affect people in different ways. These symptoms range from  mild disorientation to total incapacitation, depending on  body tolerance and altitude. Supplemental oxygen or cabin  pressurization systems help pilots fly at higher altitudes and  overcome the effects of oxygen deprivation.  

# Wind and Currents  

Air flows from areas of high pressure into areas of low  pressure because air always seeks out lower pressure. The  combination of atmospheric pressure differences, Coriolis  force, friction, and temperature differences of the air near  the earth cause two kinds of atmospheric motion: convective  currents (upward and downward motion) and wind  (horizontal motion). Currents and winds are important as  they affect takeoff, landing, and cruise flight operations. Most  importantly, currents and winds or atmospheric circulation  cause weather changes.  

# Wind Patterns  

In the Northern Hemisphere, the flow of air from areas of  high to low pressure is deflected to the right and produces  a clockwise circulation around an area of high pressure.  This is known as anticyclonic circulation. The opposite  is true of low-pressure areas; the air flows toward a low  and is deflected to create a counterclockwise or cyclonic  circulation.  [Figure 12-10]  

High-pressure systems are generally areas of dry, descending  air. Good weather is typically associated with high-pressure  systems for this reason. Conversely, air flows into a low- pressure area to replace rising air. This air usually brings  increasing cloudiness and precipitation. Thus, bad weather  is commonly associated with areas of low pressure.  

A good understanding of high- and low-pressure wind patterns  can be of great help when planning a flight because a pilot can  take advantage of beneficial tailwinds.  [Figure 12-11]  When  planning a flight from west to east, favorable winds would  be encountered along the northern side of a high-pressure  system or the southern side of a low-pressure system. On  the return flight, the most favorable winds would be along  the southern side of the same high-pressure system or the  northern side of a low-pressure system. An added advantage

Figure 12-10.   Circulation pattern about areas of high and low  pressure.  

is a better understanding of what type of weather to expect  in a given area along a route of flight based on the prevailing  areas of highs and lows.  

While the theory of circulation and wind patterns is accurate for  large scale atmospheric circulation, it does not take into account  changes to the circulation on a local scale. Local conditions,  geological features, and other anomalies can change the wind  direction and speed close to the Earth’s surface.  

# Convective Currents  

Plowed ground, rocks, sand, and barren land absorb solar  energy quickly and can therefore give off a large amount  of heat; whereas, water, trees, and other areas of vegetation  tend to more slowly absorb heat and give off heat. The  resulting uneven heating of the air creates small areas of  local circulation called convective currents.  

Convective currents cause the bumpy, turbulent air sometimes  experienced when flying at lower altitudes during warmer  weather. On a low-altitude flight over varying surfaces,  updrafts are likely to occur over pavement or barren places,  and downdrafts often occur over water or expansive areas  of vegetation like a group of trees. Typically, these turbulent  conditions can be avoided by flying at higher altitudes, even  above cumulus cloud layers.  [Figure 12-12]  

Convective currents are particularly noticeable in areas with a  land mass directly adjacent to a large body of water, such as an  ocean, large lake, or other appreciable area of water. During  the day, land heats faster than water, so the air over the land  becomes warmer and less dense. It rises and is replaced by  

![](images/151fe38e50a906154809eaa5be34309a935652a014c4c0f703cce3fa5d687544.jpg)

Figure 12-12.  Convective turbulence avoidance.  

cooler, denser air flowing in from over the water. This causes  an onshore wind called a sea breeze. Conversely, at night land  cools faster than water, as does the corresponding air. In this  case, the warmer air over the water rises and is replaced by  the cooler, denser air from the land, creating an offshore wind  called a land breeze. This reverses the local wind circulation  pattern. Convective currents can occur anywhere there is an  uneven heating of the Earth’s surface.  [Figure 12-13]  

Convective currents close to the ground can affect a pilot’s  ability to control the aircraft. For example, on final approach,  the rising air from terrain devoid of vegetation sometimes  produces a ballooning effect that can cause a pilot to overshoot  the intended landing spot. On the other hand, an approach over  a large body of water or an area of thick vegetation tends to  create a sinking effect that can cause an unwary pilot to land  short of the intended landing spot.  [Figure 12-14]  

# Effect of Obstructions on Wind  

Another atmospheric hazard exists that can create problems  for pilots. Obstructions on the ground affect the flow of  wind and can be an unseen danger. Ground topography and  large buildings can break up the flow of the wind and create  wind gusts that change rapidly in direction and speed. These  obstructions range from man-made structures, like hangars,  to large natural obstructions, such as mountains, bluffs, or  canyons. It is especially important to be vigilant when flying  in or out of airports that have large buildings or natural  obstructions located near the runway.  [Figure 12-15]  

The intensity of the turbulence associated with ground  obstructions depends on the size of the obstacle and the  primary velocity of the wind. This can affect the takeoff and  landing performance of any aircraft and can present a very  serious hazard. During the landing phase of flight, an aircraft  

![](images/16884f3b60b7546d608239f16db16f28dc184b3acdb652778964c6a957e81280.jpg)

Figure 12-15.  Turbulence caused by manmade obstructions.  

may “drop in” due to the turbulent air and be too low to clear  obstacles during the approach.  

This same condition is even more noticeable when flying in  mountainous regions.  [Figure 12-16]  While the wind flows  smoothly up the windward side of the mountain and the  upward currents help to carry an aircraft over the peak of  the mountain, the wind on the leeward side does not act in  a similar manner. As the air flows down the leeward side of  the mountain, the air follows the contour of the terrain and  is increasingly turbulent. This tends to push an aircraft into  the side of a mountain. The stronger the wind, the greater the  downward pressure and turbulence become.  

Due to the effect terrain has on the wind in valleys or canyons,  downdrafts can be severe. Before conducting a flight in or  

![](images/0bc9d5df0e452ffcb124da9cf288443879a109f2c2c653c5756955bae3578fd6.jpg)  
Figure 12-16.  Turbulence in mountainous regions.  

near mountainous terrain, it is helpful for a pilot unfamiliar  with a mountainous area to get a checkout with a mountain  qualified flight instructor.  

# Low-Level Wind Shear  

Wind shear is a sudden, drastic change in wind speed and/or  direction over a very small area. Wind shear can subject an  aircraft to violent updrafts and downdrafts, as well as abrupt  changes to the horizontal movement of the aircraft. While  wind shear can occur at any altitude, low-level wind shear is  especially hazardous due to the proximity of an aircraft to the  ground. Low-level wind shear is commonly associated with  passing frontal systems, thunderstorms, temperature inversions,  and strong upper level winds (greater than 25 knots).  

Wind shear is dangerous to an aircraft. It can rapidly change  the performance of the aircraft and disrupt the normal flight  attitude. For example, a tailwind quickly changing to a  headwind causes an increase in airspeed and performance.  Conversely, a headwind changing to a tailwind causes a  decrease in airspeed and performance. In either case, a pilot  must be prepared to react immediately to these changes to  maintain control of the aircraft.  

The most severe type of low-level wind shear, a microburst,  is associated with convective precipitation into dry air at  cloud base. Microburst activity may be indicated by an  intense rain shaft at the surface but virga at cloud base  and a ring of blowing dust is often the only visible clue.  A typical microburst has a horizontal diameter of 1–2  miles and a nominal depth of 1,000 feet. The lifespan of a  microburst is about 5–15 minutes during which time it can  produce downdrafts of up to 6,000 feet per minute (fpm)  

and headwind losses of 30–90 knots, seriously degrading  performance. It can also produce strong turbulence and  hazardous wind direction changes. Consider  Figure 12-17 :  During an inadvertent takeoff into a microburst, the plane  may first experience a performance-increasing headwind  (1), followed by performance-decreasing downdrafts (2),  followed by a rapidly increasing tailwind (3). This can result  in terrain impact or flight dangerously close to the ground (4).  An encounter during approach involves the same sequence  of wind changes and could force the plane to the ground  short of the runway.  

The FAA has made a substantial investment in microburst  accident prevention. The totally redesigned LLWAS-NE, the  TDWR, and the ASR-9 WSP are skillful microburst alerting  systems installed at major airports. These three systems were  extensively evaluated over a 3-year period. Each was seen  to issue very few false alerts and to detect microbursts well  above the 90 percent detection requirement established by  Congress. Many flights involve airports that lack microburst  alert equipment, so the FAA has also prepared wind shear  training material: Advisory Circular (AC) 00-54, FAA  Pilot Wind Shear Guide. Included is information on how to  recognize the risk of a microburst encounter, how to avoid an  encounter, and the best flight strategy for successful escape  should an encounter occur.  

It is important to remember that wind shear can affect any  flight and any pilot at any altitude. While wind shear may be  reported, it often remains undetected and is a silent danger  to aviation. Always be alert to the possibility of wind shear,  especially when flying in and around thunderstorms and  frontal systems.

# Wind and Pressure Representation on Surface  Weather Maps  

Surface weather maps provide information about fronts, areas  of high and low pressure, and surface winds and pressures  for each station. This type of weather map allows pilots to  see the locations of fronts and pressure systems, but more  importantly, it depicts the wind and pressure at the surface  for each location. For more information on surface analysis  and weather depiction charts, see Chapter 13, Aviation  Weather Services.  

Wind conditions are reported by an arrow attached to the  station location circle.  [Figure 12-18]  The station circle  represents the head of the arrow, with the arrow pointing  in the direction from which the wind is blowing. Winds  are described by the direction from which they blow, thus  a northwest wind means that the wind is blowing from the  northwest toward the southeast. The speed of the wind is  depicted by barbs or pennants placed on the wind line. Each  barb represents a speed of ten knots, while half a barb is equal  to five knots, and a pennant is equal to 50 knots.  

The pressure for each station is recorded on the weather chart  and is shown in mb. Isobars are lines drawn on the chart to  depict lines of equal pressure. These lines result in a pattern  that reveals the pressure gradient or change in pressure over  distance.  [Figure 12-19]  Isobars are similar to contour lines  on a topographic map that indicate terrain altitudes and  slope steepness. For example, isobars that are closely spaced  indicate a steep pressure gradient and strong winds prevail.  Shallow gradients, on the other hand, are represented by  isobars that are spaced far apart and are indicative of light  winds. Isobars help identify low- and high-pressure systems,  as well as the location of ridges and troughs. A high is an  area of high pressure surrounded by lower pressure; a low  is an area of low pressure surrounded by higher pressure. A  ridge is an elongated area of high pressure, and a trough is  an elongated area of low pressure.  

Isobars furnish valuable information about winds in the first  few thousand feet above the surface. Close to the ground,

Figure 12-19.   Isobars reveal the pressure gradient of an area of  high- or low-pressure areas.  

wind direction is modified by the friction and wind speed  decreases due to friction with the surface. At levels 2,000 to  3,000 feet above the surface, however, the speed is greater  and the direction becomes more parallel to the isobars.  

Generally, the wind 2,000 feet above ground level (AGL) is   $20^{\circ}$   to  $40^{\circ}$   to the right of surface winds, and the wind speed is  greater. The change of wind direction is greatest over rough  terrain and least over flat surfaces, such as open water. In the  absence of winds aloft information, this rule of thumb allows  for a rough estimate of the wind conditions a few thousand  feet above the surface.  

# Atmospheric Stability  

The stability of the atmosphere depends on its ability to  resist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes vertical  movement difficult, and small vertical disturbances dampen  out and disappear. In an unstable atmosphere, small vertical air  movements tend to become larger, resulting in turbulent airflow  and convective activity. Instability can lead to significant  turbulence, extensive vertical clouds, and severe weather.  

Rising air expands and cools due to the decrease in air  pressure as altitude increases. The opposite is true of  descending air; as atmospheric pressure increases, the  temperature of descending air increases as it is compressed.  Adiabatic heating and adiabatic cooling are terms used to  describe this temperature change.  

The adiabatic process takes place in all upward and  downward moving air. When air rises into an area of lower  pressure, it expands to a larger volume. As the molecules  of air expand, the temperature of the air lowers. As a result,  when a parcel of air rises, pressure decreases, volume  increases, and temperature decreases. When air descends,  the opposite is true. The rate at which temperature decreases  with an increase in altitude is referred to as its lapse rate.  As air ascends through the atmosphere, the average rate of  temperature change is  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $3.5\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ) per 1,000 feet.  

Since water vapor is lighter than air, moisture decreases air  density, causing it to rise. Conversely, as moisture decreases,  air becomes denser and tends to sink. Since moist air cools  at a slower rate, it is generally less stable than dry air since  the moist air must rise higher before its temperature cools  to that of the surrounding air. The dry adiabatic lapse rate  (unsaturated air) is  $3\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$     $(5.4~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   per 1,000 feet. The moist  adiabatic lapse rate varies from   $1.1~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   to   $2.8~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   (  $2\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $5\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ) per 1,000 feet.  

The combination of moisture and temperature determine the  stability of the air and the resulting weather. Cool, dry air  is very stable and resists vertical movement, which leads to  good and generally clear weather. The greatest instability  occurs when the air is moist and warm, as it is in the tropical  regions in the summer. Typically, thunderstorms appear on  a daily basis in these regions due to the instability of the  surrounding air.  

# Inversion  

As air rises and expands in the atmosphere, the temperature  decreases. There is an atmospheric anomaly that can occur;  however, that changes this typical pattern of atmospheric  behavior. When the temperature of the air rises with altitude, a  temperature inversion exists. Inversion layers are commonly  shallow layers of smooth, stable air close to the ground. The  temperature of the air increases with altitude to a certain  point, which is the top of the inversion. The air at the top  of the layer acts as a lid, keeping weather and pollutants  trapped below. If the relative humidity of the air is high, it  can contribute to the formation of clouds, fog, haze, or smoke  resulting in diminished visibility in the inversion layer.  

Surface-based temperature inversions occur on clear, cool  nights when the air close to the ground is cooled by the  lowering temperature of the ground. The air within a few  hundred feet of the surface becomes cooler than the air above  it. Frontal inversions occur when warm air spreads over a  layer of cooler air, or cooler air is forced under a layer of  warmer air.  

# Moisture and Temperature  

The atmosphere, by nature, contains moisture in the form  of water vapor. The amount of moisture present in the  atmosphere is dependent upon the temperature of the air.  Every  $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   increase in temperature doubles the amount of  moisture the air can hold. Conversely, a decrease of   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  cuts the capacity in half.  

Water is present in the atmosphere in three states: liquid,  solid, and gaseous. All three forms can readily change to  another, and all are present within the temperature ranges of  the atmosphere. As water changes from one state to another,  an exchange of heat takes place. These changes occur through  the processes of evaporation, sublimation, condensation,  deposition, melting, or freezing. However, water vapor  is added into the atmosphere only by the processes of  evaporation and sublimation.  

Evaporation is the changing of liquid water to water vapor.  As water vapor forms, it absorbs heat from the nearest  available source. This heat exchange is known as the latent  heat of evaporation. A good example is the evaporation of  human perspiration. The net effect is a cooling sensation  as heat is extracted from the body. Similarly, sublimation  is the changing of ice directly to water vapor, completely  bypassing the liquid stage. Though dry ice is not made of  water, but rather carbon dioxide, it demonstrates the principle  of sublimation when a solid turns directly into vapor.  

# Relative Humidity  

Humidity refers to the amount of water vapor present in the  atmosphere at a given time. Relative humidity is the actual  amount of moisture in the air compared to the total amount of  moisture the air could hold at that temperature. For example,  if the current relative humidity is 65 percent, the air is  holding 65 percent of the total amount of moisture that it is  capable of holding at that temperature and pressure. While  much of the western United States rarely sees days of high  humidity, relative humidity readings of 75 to 90 percent are  not uncommon in the southern United States during warmer  months.  [Figure 12-20]  

# Temperature/Dew Point Relationship  

The relationship between dew point and temperature defines  the concept of relative humidity. The dew point, given in  degrees, is the temperature at which the air can hold no  more moisture. When the temperature of the air is reduced  to the dew point, the air is completely saturated and moisture  begins to condense out of the air in the form of fog, dew,  frost, clouds, rain, or snow.  

![](images/63f56baeaad95045b9d332b9bc87d960c232c96cdcf7fcc33bd26aaac887e812.jpg)  
Figure 12-20.  Relationship between relative humidity, temperature, and dewpoint.  

As moist, unstable air rises, clouds often form at the altitude  where temperature and dew point reach the same value. When  lifted, unsaturated air cools at a rate of  $5.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   per 1,000 feet  and the dew point temperature decreases at a rate of   $1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   per  1,000 feet. This results in a convergence of temperature and  dew point at a rate of   $4.4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Apply the convergence rate  to the reported temperature and dew point to determine the  height of the cloud base.  

Given:  

Temperature  $(\mathrm{T})=85\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Dew point  $(\mathrm{DP})=71~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  Convergence Rate   $\mathrm{(CR)}=4.4^{\circ}

$   $\mathrm{T}-\mathrm{DP}=$   Temperature Dew Point Spread (TDS) 

  $\mathrm{TDS}\div\mathrm{CR}=\mathrm{X}

$   $\mathrm{X}\times1{,}000$   feet  $=$   height of cloud base AGL  

Example:  

$\begin{array}{l}{85\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}-71\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}=14\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}}\\ {14\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\div4.4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}=3.18}\end{array}

$   $3.18\times1{,}000=3{,}180$   feet AGL The height of the cloud base is 3,180 feet AGL.  

Explanation:  

With an outside air temperature (OAT) of  $85\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   at the surface  and dew point at the surface of  $71\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  , the spread is   $14^{\circ}$  . Divide  the temperature dew point spread by the convergence rate of   $4.4~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  , and multiply by 1,000 to determine the approximate  height of the cloud base.  

# Methods by Which Air Reaches the Saturation Point  

If air reaches the saturation point while temperature and  dew point are close together, it is highly likely that fog, low  clouds, and precipitation will form. There are four methods  by which air can reach the saturation point. First, when warm  air moves over a cold surface, the air temperature drops and  reaches the saturation point. Second, the saturation point may  be reached when cold air and warm air mix. Third, when air  cools at night through contact with the cooler ground, air  reaches its saturation point. The fourth method occurs when  air is lifted or is forced upward in the atmosphere.  

As air rises, it uses heat energy to expand. As a result, the rising  air loses heat rapidly. Unsaturated air loses heat at a rate of   $3.0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\,(5.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   for every 1,000 feet of altitude gain. No matter  what causes the air to reach its saturation point, saturated air  brings clouds, rain, and other critical weather situations.  

# Dew and Frost  

On cool, clear, calm nights, the temperature of the ground  and objects on the surface can cause temperatures of the  surrounding air to drop below the dew point. When this  occurs, the moisture in the air condenses and deposits itself on  the ground, buildings, and other objects like cars and aircraft.  This moisture is known as dew and sometimes can be seen  on grass and other objects in the morning. If the temperature  is below freezing, the moisture is deposited in the form of  frost. While dew poses no threat to an aircraft, frost poses a  definite flight safety hazard. Frost disrupts the flow of air over  the wing and can drastically reduce the production of lift. It  also increases drag, which when combined with lowered lift  production, can adversely affect the ability to take off. An  aircraft must be thoroughly cleaned and free of frost prior  to beginning a flight.  

# Fog  

Fog is a cloud that is on the surface. It typically occurs when  the temperature of air near the ground is cooled to the air’s  dew point. At this point, water vapor in the air condenses and  becomes visible in the form of fog. Fog is classified according  to the manner in which it forms and is dependent upon the  current temperature and the amount of water vapor in the air.  

On clear nights, with relatively little to no wind present,  radiation fog may develop.  [Figure 12-21]  Usually, it forms  in low-lying areas like mountain valleys. This type of fog  occurs when the ground cools rapidly due to terrestrial  radiation, and the surrounding air temperature reaches its  dew point. As the sun rises and the temperature increases,  radiation fog lifts and eventually burns off. Any increase in  wind also speeds the dissipation of radiation fog. If radiation  fog is less than 20 feet thick, it is known as ground fog.  

When a layer of warm, moist air moves over a cold surface,  advection fog is likely to occur. Unlike radiation fog, wind  is required to form advection fog. Winds of up to 15 knots  

![](images/73d8958f9438b0f2245541388f0b18adf24c80c766c0a1f9c334a3fc742abb61.jpg)  
Figure 12-21.  Radiation fog.  

allow the fog to form and intensify; above a speed of 15 knots,  the fog usually lifts and forms low stratus clouds. Advection  fog is common in coastal areas where sea breezes can blow  the air over cooler landmasses.  

Upslope fog occurs when moist, stable air is forced up sloping  land features like a mountain range. This type of fog also  requires wind for formation and continued existence. Upslope  and advection fog, unlike radiation fog, may not burn off with  the morning sun but instead can persist for days. They can  also extend to greater heights than radiation fog.  

Steam fog, or sea smoke, forms when cold, dry air moves over  warm water. As the water evaporates, it rises and resembles  smoke. This type of fog is common over bodies of water  during the coldest times of the year. Low-level turbulence  and icing are commonly associated with steam fog.  

Ice fog occurs in cold weather when the temperature is  much below freezing and water vapor forms directly into ice  crystals. Conditions favorable for its formation are the same  as for radiation fog except for cold temperature, usually  $-25$   $^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or colder. It occurs mostly in the arctic regions but is not  unknown in middle latitudes during the cold season.  

# Clouds  

Clouds are visible indicators and are often indicative of  future weather. For clouds to form, there must be adequate  water vapor and condensation nuclei, as well as a method by  which the air can be cooled. When the air cools and reaches  its saturation point, the invisible water vapor changes into  a visible state. Through the processes of deposition (also  referred to as sublimation) and condensation, moisture  condenses or sublimates onto miniscule particles of matter  like dust, salt, and smoke known as condensation nuclei. The  nuclei are important because they provide a means for the  moisture to change from one state to another.  

Cloud type is determined by its height, shape, and  characteristics. They are classified according to the height of  their bases as low, middle, or high clouds, as well as clouds  with vertical development.  [Figure 12-22]  

Low clouds are those that form near the Earth’s surface and  extend up to about 6,500 feet AGL. They are made primarily  of water droplets but can include supercooled water droplets  that induce hazardous aircraft icing. Typical low clouds  are stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus. Fog is also  classified as a type of low cloud formation. Clouds in this  family create low ceilings, hamper visibility, and can change  rapidly. Because of this, they influence flight planning and  can make visual flight rules (VFR) flight impossible.  

![](images/db3a4178786ce42bf12f44b8a6e849f7a614fab1f2719bad0c8ccec1a04306c9.jpg)  
Figure 12-22.  Basic cloud types.  

Middle clouds form around 6,500 feet AGL and extend up to  20,000 feet AGL. They are composed of water, ice crystals,  and supercooled water droplets. Typical middle-level clouds  include altostratus and altocumulus. These types of clouds  may be encountered on cross-country flights at higher  altitudes. Altostratus clouds can produce turbulence and may  contain moderate icing. Altocumulus clouds, which usually  form when altostratus clouds are breaking apart, also may  contain light turbulence and icing.  

High clouds form above 20,000 feet AGL and usually form  only in stable air. They are made up of ice crystals and pose  no real threat of turbulence or aircraft icing. Typical high  level clouds are cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus.  

Clouds with extensive vertical development are cumulus  clouds that build vertically into towering cumulus or  cumulonimbus clouds. The bases of these clouds form in  the low to middle cloud base region but can extend into high  altitude cloud levels. Towering cumulus clouds indicate areas  of instability in the atmosphere, and the air around and inside  them is turbulent. These types of clouds often develop into  cumulonimbus clouds or thunderstorms. Cumulonimbus  clouds contain large amounts of moisture and unstable air  and usually produce hazardous weather phenomena, such  as lightning, hail, tornadoes, gusty winds, and wind shear.  These extensive vertical clouds can be obscured by other  cloud formations and are not always visible from the ground  or while in flight. When this happens, these clouds are said  to be embedded, hence the term, embedded thunderstorms.  

To pilots, the cumulonimbus cloud is perhaps the most  dangerous cloud type. It appears individually or in groups and  is known as either an air mass or orographic thunderstorm.  Heating of the air near the Earth’s surface creates an air mass  thunderstorm; the upslope motion of air in the mountainous  regions causes orographic thunderstorms. Cumulonimbus  clouds that form in a continuous line are nonfrontal bands  of thunderstorms or squall lines.  

Since rising air currents cause cumulonimbus clouds, they  are extremely turbulent and pose a significant hazard to flight  safety. For example, if an aircraft enters a thunderstorm,  the aircraft could experience updrafts and downdrafts that  exceed   $3{,}000~\mathrm{fpm}$  . In addition, thunderstorms can produce  large hailstones, damaging lightning, tornadoes, and large  quantities of water, all of which are potentially hazardous  to aircraft.  

Cloud classification can be further broken down into specific  cloud types according to the outward appearance and cloud  composition. Knowing these terms can help a pilot identify  visible clouds.  

The following is a list of cloud classifications:  

•	 Cumulus—heaped or piled clouds •	 Stratus—formed in layers •	 Cirrus—ringlets, fibrous clouds, also high level clouds  above 20,000 feet •	 Castellanus—common base with separate vertical  development, castle-like •	 Lenticularus—lens-shaped, formed over mountains  in strong winds •	 Nimbus—rain-bearing clouds •	 Fracto—ragged or broken •	 Alto—middle level clouds existing at 5,000 to 20,000  feet  

# Ceiling  

For aviation purposes, a ceiling is the lowest layer of clouds  reported as being broken or overcast, or the vertical visibility  into an obscuration like fog or haze. Clouds are reported  as broken when five-eighths to seven-eighths of the sky is  covered with clouds. Overcast means the entire sky is covered  with clouds. Current ceiling information is reported by the  aviation routine weather report (METAR) and automated  weather stations of various types.  

# Visibility  

Closely related to cloud cover and reported ceilings is  visibility information. Visibility refers to the greatest  horizontal distance at which prominent objects can be  viewed with the naked eye. Current visibility is also reported  in METAR and other aviation weather reports, as well as  by automated weather systems. Visibility information, as  predicted by meteorologists, is available for a pilot during a  preflight weather briefing.  

# Precipitation  

Precipitation refers to any type of water particles that  form in the atmosphere and fall to the ground. It has a  profound impact on flight safety. Depending on the form of  precipitation, it can reduce visibility, create icing situations,  and affect landing and takeoff performance of an aircraft.  

Precipitation occurs because water or ice particles in clouds  grow in size until the atmosphere can no longer support  them. It can occur in several forms as it falls toward the  Earth, including drizzle, rain, ice pellets, hail, snow, and ice.  

Drizzle is classified as very small water droplets, smaller  than 0.02 inches in diameter. Drizzle usually accompanies  fog or low stratus clouds. Water droplets of larger size are  referred to as rain. Rain that falls through the atmosphere but  evaporates prior to striking the ground is known as virga.  Freezing rain and freezing drizzle occur when the temperature  of the surface is below freezing; the rain freezes on contact  with the cooler surface.  

If rain falls through a temperature inversion, it may freeze  as it passes through the underlying cold air and fall to the  ground in the form of ice pellets. Ice pellets are an indication  of a temperature inversion and that freezing rain exists at a  higher altitude. In the case of hail, freezing water droplets are  carried up and down by drafts inside cumulonimbus clouds,  growing larger in size as they come in contact with more  moisture. Once the updrafts can no longer hold the freezing  water, it falls to the Earth in the form of hail. Hail can be  pea sized, or it can grow as large as five inches in diameter,  larger than a softball.  

Snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals that falls  at a steady rate or in snow showers that begin, change in  intensity, and end rapidly. Snow also varies in size, from very  small grains to large flakes. Snow grains are the equivalent  of drizzle in size.  

Precipitation in any form poses a threat to safety of flight.  Often, precipitation is accompanied by low ceilings and  reduced visibility. Aircraft that have ice, snow, or frost on  their surfaces must be carefully cleaned prior to beginning  a flight because of the possible airflow disruption and  loss of lift. Rain can contribute to water in the fuel tanks.  Precipitation can create hazards on the runway surface itself,  making takeoffs and landings difficult, if not impossible,  due to snow, ice, or pooling water and very slick surfaces.  

# Air Masses  

Air masses are classified according to the regions where  they originate. They are large bodies of air that take on the  characteristics of the surrounding area or source region. A  source region is typically an area in which the air remains  relatively stagnant for a period of days or longer. During  this time of stagnation, the air mass takes on the temperature  and moisture characteristics of the source region. Areas of  stagnation can be found in polar regions, tropical oceans, and  dry deserts. Air masses are generally identified as polar or  tropical based on temperature characteristics and maritime  or continental based on moisture content.  

A continental polar air mass forms over a polar region and  brings cool, dry air with it. Maritime tropical air masses form  over warm tropical waters like the Caribbean Sea and bring  warm, moist air. As the air mass moves from its source region  and passes over land or water, the air mass is subjected to  the varying conditions of the land or water which modify the  nature of the air mass.  [Figure 12-23]  

An air mass passing over a warmer surface is warmed from  below, and convective currents form, causing the air to rise.  This creates an unstable air mass with good surface visibility.  Moist, unstable air causes cumulus clouds, showers, and  turbulence to form.  

Conversely, an air mass passing over a colder surface does not  form convective currents but instead creates a stable air mass  with poor surface visibility. The poor surface visibility is due  to the fact that smoke, dust, and other particles cannot rise  out of the air mass and are instead trapped near the surface.  A stable air mass can produce low stratus clouds and fog.  

# Fronts  

As an air mass moves across bodies of water and land, it  eventually comes in contact with another air mass with  different characteristics. The boundary layer between two  types of air masses is known as a front. An approaching  front of any type always means changes to the weather  are imminent.  

There are four types of fronts that are named according to the  temperature of the advancing air relative to the temperature  of the air it is replacing:  [Figure 12-24]  

•	 Warm  •	 Cold  •	 Stationary  •	 Occluded  

Any discussion of frontal systems must be tempered with  the knowledge that no two fronts are the same. However,  generalized weather conditions are associated with a specific  type of front that helps identify the front.  

# Warm Front  

A warm front occurs when a warm mass of air advances and  replaces a body of colder air. Warm fronts move slowly,  typically 10 to 25 miles per hour (mph). The slope of the  advancing front slides over the top of the cooler air and  gradually pushes it out of the area. Warm fronts contain  warm air that often has very high humidity. As the warm  air is lifted, the temperature drops and condensation occurs.  

Generally, prior to the passage of a warm front, cirriform  or stratiform clouds, along with fog, can be expected to  form along the frontal boundary. In the summer months,  cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) are likely to develop.

Light to moderate precipitation is probable, usually in the  form of rain, sleet, snow, or drizzle, accentuated by poor  visibility. The wind blows from the south-southeast, and the  outside temperature is cool or cold with an increasing dew  point. Finally, as the warm front approaches, the barometric  pressure continues to fall until the front passes completely.  

During the passage of a warm front, stratiform clouds are  visible and drizzle may be falling. The visibility is generally  poor, but improves with variable winds. The temperature rises  steadily from the inflow of relatively warmer air. For the most  part, the dew point remains steady and the pressure levels off. After the passage of a warm front, stratocumulus clouds  predominate and rain showers are possible. The visibility  eventually improves, but hazy conditions may exist for a  short period after passage. The wind blows from the south- southwest. With warming temperatures, the dew point  rises and then levels off. There is generally a slight rise in  barometric pressure, followed by a decrease of barometric  pressure.  

# Flight Toward an Approaching Warm Front  

By studying a typical warm front, much can be learned  about the general patterns and atmospheric conditions  that exist when a warm front is encountered in flight.  Figure 12-25  depicts a warm front advancing eastward from  St. Louis, Missouri, toward Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during  a flight from Pittsburgh to St. Louis.  

At the time of departure from Pittsburgh, the weather is good  VFR with a scattered layer of cirrus clouds at 15,000 feet.  As the flight progresses westward to Columbus and closer  to the oncoming warm front, the clouds deepen and become  increasingly stratiform in appearance with a ceiling of 6,000  feet. The visibility decreases to six miles in haze with a falling  

![](images/7e3639cfae79f573916d12d7856b74978d7db7e41af9b234fcdc8ebebb57b9be.jpg)  
Figure 12-25.  Warm front cross-section with surface weather chart depiction and associated METAR.  

barometric pressure. Approaching Indianapolis, the weather  deteriorates to broken clouds at 2,000 feet with three miles  visibility and rain. With the temperature and dew point the  same, fog is likely to develop. At St. Louis, the sky is overcast  with low clouds and drizzle and the visibility is one mile.  Beyond Indianapolis, the ceiling and visibility are too low  to continue VFR. Therefore, it would be wise to remain in  Indianapolis until the warm front passes, which may take  up to two days.  

# Cold Front  

A cold front occurs when a mass of cold, dense, and stable  air advances and replaces a body of warmer air.  

Cold fronts move more rapidly than warm fronts, progressing  at a rate of 25 to   $30~\mathrm{{mph}}$  . However, extreme cold fronts  have been recorded moving at speeds of up to   $60\ \mathrm{mph}$  .  A typical cold front moves in a manner opposite that of a  warm front. It is so dense, it stays close to the ground and  acts like a snowplow, sliding under the warmer air and  forcing the less dense air aloft. The rapidly ascending air  causes the temperature to decrease suddenly, forcing the  creation of clouds. The type of clouds that form depends  on the stability of the warmer air mass. A cold front in the  Northern Hemisphere is normally oriented in a northeast to  southwest manner and can be several hundred miles long,  encompassing a large area of land.  

Prior to the passage of a typical cold front, cirriform or  towering cumulus clouds are present, and cumulonimbus  clouds may develop. Rain showers may also develop due  to the rapid development of clouds. A high dew point and  falling barometric pressure are indicative of imminent cold  front passage.  

As the cold front passes, towering cumulus or cumulonimbus  clouds continue to dominate the sky. Depending on the  intensity of the cold front, heavy rain showers form and may  be accompanied by lightning, thunder, and/or hail. More  severe cold fronts can also produce tornadoes. During cold  front passage, the visibility is poor with winds variable and  gusty, and the temperature and dew point drop rapidly. A  quickly falling barometric pressure bottoms out during frontal  passage, then begins a gradual increase.  

After frontal passage, the towering cumulus and  cumulonimbus clouds begin to dissipate to cumulus clouds  with a corresponding decrease in the precipitation. Good  visibility eventually prevails with the winds from the west- northwest. Temperatures remain cooler and the barometric  pressure continues to rise.  

# Fast-Moving Cold Front  

Fast-moving cold fronts are pushed by intense pressure  systems far behind the actual front. The friction between  the ground and the cold front retards the movement of the  front and creates a steeper frontal surface. This results in a  very narrow band of weather, concentrated along the leading  edge of the front. If the warm air being overtaken by the  cold front is relatively stable, overcast skies and rain may  occur for some distance behind the front. If the warm air  is unstable, scattered thunderstorms and rain showers may  form. A continuous line of thunderstorms, or squall line,  may form along or ahead of the front. Squall lines present  a serious hazard to pilots as squall-type thunderstorms are  intense and move quickly. Behind a fast-moving cold front,  the skies usually clear rapidly, and the front leaves behind  gusty, turbulent winds and colder temperatures.  

# Flight Toward an Approaching Cold Front  

Like warm fronts, not all cold fronts are the same. Examining  a flight toward an approaching cold front, pilots can get a  better understanding of the type of conditions that can be  encountered in flight.  Figure 12-26  depicts a flight from  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, toward St. Louis, Missouri.  

At the time of departure from Pittsburgh, the weather is VFR  with three miles visibility in smoke and a scattered layer of  clouds at 3,500 feet. As the flight progresses westward to  Columbus and closer to the oncoming cold front, the clouds  show signs of vertical development with a broken layer at  2,500 feet. The visibility is six miles in haze with a falling  barometric pressure. Approaching Indianapolis, the weather  has deteriorated to overcast clouds at 1,000 feet and three  miles visibility with thunderstorms and heavy rain showers.  At St. Louis, the weather gets better with scattered clouds at  1,000 feet and a ten mile visibility.  

A pilot using sound judgment based on the knowledge of  frontal conditions will likely remain in Indianapolis until the  front has passed. Trying to fly below a line of thunderstorms  or a squall line is hazardous, and flight over the top of or  around the storm is not an option. Thunderstorms can extend  up to well over the capability of small airplanes and can  extend in a line for 300 to 500 miles.  

# Comparison of Cold and Warm Fronts  

Warm fronts and cold fronts are very different in nature as are  the hazards associated with each front. They vary in speed,  composition, weather phenomenon, and prediction. Cold fronts,  which move at 20 to   $35~\mathrm{mph}$  , travel faster than warm fronts,  which move at only 10 to  $25\,\mathrm{mph}$  . Cold fronts also possess a  

![](images/c604bf319f13f5e3a17d5e4a49d878e0c689b40c32318ec064f3ed9e0265b54f.jpg)  
Figure 12-26.  Cold front cross-section with surface weather chart depiction and associated METAR.  

steeper frontal slope. Violent weather activity is associated with  cold fronts, and the weather usually occurs along the frontal  boundary, not in advance. However, squall lines can form  during the summer months as far as 200 miles in advance of  a strong cold front. Whereas warm fronts bring low ceilings,  poor visibility, and rain, cold fronts bring sudden storms, gusty  winds, turbulence, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.  

Cold fronts are fast approaching with little or no warning,  and they bring about a complete weather change in just a  few hours. The weather clears rapidly after passage and drier  air with unlimited visibilities prevail. Warm fronts, on the  other hand, provide advance warning of their approach and  can take days to pass through a region.  

# Wind Shifts  

Wind around a high-pressure system rotates clockwise, while  low-pressure winds rotate counter-clockwise. When two  high pressure systems are adjacent, the winds are almost in  direct opposition to each other at the point of contact. Fronts  are the boundaries between two areas of high pressure, and  therefore, wind shifts are continually occurring within a front.  Shifting wind direction is most pronounced in conjunction  with cold fronts.  

# Stationary Front  

When the forces of two air masses are relatively equal, the  boundary or front that separates them remains stationary and  influences the local weather for days. This front is called a  stationary front. The weather associated with a stationary  front is typically a mixture that can be found in both warm  and cold fronts.  

# Occluded Front  

An occluded front occurs when a fast-moving cold front  catches up with a slow-moving warm front. As the occluded  front approaches, warm front weather prevails but is  immediately followed by cold front weather. There are two  types of occluded fronts that can occur, and the temperatures  of the colliding frontal systems play a large part in defining  the type of front and the resulting weather. A cold front  occlusion occurs when a fast moving cold front is colder  than the air ahead of the slow moving warm front. When  this occurs, the cold air replaces the cool air and forces the  warm front aloft into the atmosphere. Typically, the cold  front occlusion creates a mixture of weather found in both  warm and cold fronts, providing the air is relatively stable.  A warm front occlusion occurs when the air ahead of the  warm front is colder than the air of the cold front. When this  is the case, the cold front rides up and over the warm front. If  the air forced aloft by the warm front occlusion is unstable,  the weather is more severe than the weather found in a cold  front occlusion. Embedded thunderstorms, rain, and fog are  likely to occur.  

Figure 12-27  depicts a cross-section of a typical cold  front occlusion. The warm front slopes over the prevailing  cooler air and produces the warm front type weather. Prior  to the passage of the typical occluded front, cirriform and  stratiform clouds prevail, light to heavy precipitation falls,  visibility is poor, dew point is steady, and barometric pressure  drops. During the passage of the front, nimbostratus and  cumulonimbus clouds predominate, and towering cumulus  clouds may also form. Light to heavy precipitation falls,  visibility is poor, winds are variable, and the barometric  pressure levels off. After the passage of the front, nimbostratus  and altostratus clouds are visible, precipitation decreases, and  visibility improves.  

# Thunderstorms  

A thunderstorm makes its way through three distinct stages  before dissipating. It begins with the cumulus stage, in  which lifting action of the air begins. If sufficient moisture  and instability are present, the clouds continue to increase  in vertical height. Continuous, strong updrafts prohibit  moisture from falling. Within approximately 15 minutes,  the thunderstorm reaches the mature stage, which is the most  violent time period of the thunderstorm’s life cycle. At this  point, drops of moisture, whether rain or ice, are too heavy  for the cloud to support and begin falling in the form of rain  or hail. This creates a downward motion of the air. Warm,  rising air; cool, precipitation-induced descending air; and  violent turbulence all exist within and near the cloud. Below  the cloud, the down-rushing air increases surface winds and  decreases the temperature. Once the vertical motion near the  top of the cloud slows down, the top of the cloud spreads  out and takes on an anvil-like shape. At this point, the storm  enters the dissipating stage. This is when the downdrafts  spread out and replace the updrafts needed to sustain the  storm.  [Figure 12-28]  

It is impossible to fly over thunderstorms in light aircraft.  Severe thunderstorms can punch through the tropopause and  reach staggering heights of 50,000 to 60,000 feet depending  on latitude. Flying under thunderstorms can subject aircraft  to rain, hail, damaging lightning, and violent turbulence.  A good rule of thumb is to circumnavigate thunderstorms  identified as severe or giving an extreme radar echo by at

least 20 nautical miles (NM) since hail may fall for miles  outside of the clouds. If flying around a thunderstorm is not  an option, stay on the ground until it passes.  

For a thunderstorm to form, the air must have sufficient water  vapor, an unstable lapse rate, and an initial lifting action to  start the storm process. Some storms occur at random in  unstable air, last for only an hour or two, and produce only  moderate wind gusts and rainfall. These are known as air  mass thunderstorms and are generally a result of surface  heating. Steady-state thunderstorms are associated with  weather systems. Fronts, converging winds, and troughs  aloft force upward motion spawning these storms that often  form into squall lines. In the mature stage, updrafts become  stronger and last much longer than in air mass storms, hence  the name steady state.  [Figure 12-29]  

Knowledge of thunderstorms and the hazards associated with  them is critical to the safety of flight.  

# Hazards  

All thunderstorms have conditions that are a hazard to aviation.  These hazards occur in numerous combinations. While not  every thunderstorm contains all hazards, it is not possible to  visually determine which hazards a thunderstorm contains.  

# Squall Line  

A squall line is a narrow band of active thunderstorms. Often  it develops on or ahead of a cold front in moist, unstable  air, but it may develop in unstable air far removed from  any front. The line may be too long to detour easily and too  wide and severe to penetrate. It often contains steady-state  thunderstorms and presents the single most intense weather  hazard to aircraft. It usually forms rapidly, generally reaching  maximum intensity during the late afternoon and the first  few hours of darkness.  

# Tornadoes  

The most violent thunderstorms draw air into their cloud  bases with great vigor. If the incoming air has any initial  rotating motion, it often forms an extremely concentrated  vortex from the surface well into the cloud. Meteorologists  have estimated that wind in such a vortex can exceed 200  knots  with pressure inside the vortex quite low. The strong  winds gather dust and debris and the low pressure generates  a funnel-shaped cloud extending downward from the  cumulonimbus base. If the cloud does not reach the surface,  it is a funnel cloud; if it touches a land surface, it is a tornado;  and if it touches water, it is a “waterspout.”  

![](images/99ec0457fab15ade2b28f92fb64c1fcbc4a70bc6ad889e3b0e3c66b3a99db887.jpg)  
Figure 12-29.  Movement and turbulence of a maturing thunderstorm.  

Tornadoes occur with both isolated and squall line  thunderstorms. Reports for forecasts of tornadoes indicate  that atmospheric conditions are favorable for violent  turbulence. An aircraft entering a tornado vortex is almost  certain to suffer loss of control and structural damage. Since  the vortex extends well into the cloud, any pilot inadvertently  caught on instruments in a severe thunderstorm could  encounter a hidden vortex.  

Families of tornadoes have been observed as appendages of  the main cloud extending several miles outward from the area  of lightning and precipitation. Thus, any cloud connected to  a severe thunderstorm carries a threat of violence.  

# Turbulence  

Potentially hazardous turbulence is present in all  thunderstorms, and a severe thunderstorm can destroy an  aircraft. Strongest turbulence within the cloud occurs with  shear between updrafts and downdrafts. Outside the cloud,  shear turbulence has been encountered several thousand feet  above and 20 miles laterally from a severe storm. A low-level  turbulent area is the shear zone associated with the gust front.  Often, a “roll cloud” on the leading edge of a storm marks the  top of the eddies in this shear, and it signifies an extremely  turbulent zone. Gust fronts often move far ahead (up to 15  miles) of associated precipitation. The gust front causes a  rapid, and sometimes drastic, change in surface wind ahead  of an approaching storm. Advisory Circular (AC) 00-54, Pilot  Windshear Guide, explains gust front hazards associated with  thunderstorms. Figure 2 in the AC shows a cross section of a  mature stage thunderstorm with a gust front area where very  serious turbulence may be encountered.  

# Icing  

Updrafts in a thunderstorm support abundant liquid water  with relatively large droplet sizes. When carried above  the freezing level, the water becomes supercooled. When  temperature in the upward current cools to about  $-15\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  much of the remaining water vapor sublimates as ice crystals.  Above this level, at lower temperatures, the amount of  supercooled water decreases.  

Supercooled water freezes on impact with an aircraft. Clear  icing can occur at any altitude above the freezing level, but at  high levels, icing from smaller droplets may be rime or mixed  rime and clear ice. The abundance of large, supercooled  water droplets makes clear icing very rapid between  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and   $-15~^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   and encounters can be frequent in a cluster of cells.  Thunderstorm icing can be extremely hazardous.  

Thunderstorms are not the only area where pilots could  encounter icing conditions. Pilots should be alert for icing  anytime the temperature approaches  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and visible moisture  is present.  

# Engine Water Ingestion  

Hail competes with turbulence as the greatest thunderstorm  hazard to aircraft. Supercooled drops above the freezing level  begin to freeze. Once a drop has frozen, other drops latch on  and freeze to it, so the hailstone grows—sometimes into a  huge ice ball. Large hail occurs with severe thunderstorms  with strong updrafts that have built to great heights.  Eventually, the hailstones fall, possibly some distance from  the storm core. Hail may be encountered in clear air several  miles from thunderstorm clouds.  

As hailstones fall through air whose temperature is above 0   $^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  , they begin to melt and precipitation may reach the ground  as either hail or rain. Rain at the surface does not mean the  absence of hail aloft. Possible hail should be anticipated  with any thunderstorm, especially beneath the anvil of a  large cumulonimbus. Hailstones larger than one-half inch  in diameter can significantly damage an aircraft in a few  seconds.  

# Ceiling and Visibility  

Generally, visibility is near zero within a thunderstorm  cloud. Ceiling and visibility also may be restricted in  precipitation and dust between the cloud base and the ground.  The restrictions create the same problem as all ceiling and  visibility restrictions; but the hazards are multiplied when  associated with the other thunderstorm hazards of turbulence,  hail, and lightning.  

Turbine engines have a limit on the amount of water they  can ingest. Updrafts are present in many thunderstorms,  particularly those in the developing stages. If the updraft  velocity in the thunderstorm approaches or exceeds the  terminal velocity of the falling raindrops, very high  concentrations of water may occur. It is possible that these  concentrations can be in excess of the quantity of water  turbine engines are designed to ingest. Therefore, severe  thunderstorms may contain areas of high water concentration,  which could result in flameout and/or structural failure of  one or more engines.  

# Chapter Summary  

Knowledge of the atmosphere and the forces acting within  it to create weather is essential to understand how weather  affects a flight. By understanding basic weather theories, a  pilot can make sound decisions during flight planning after  receiving weather briefings. For additional information on the  topics discussed in this chapter, see the following publications  as amended: AC 00-6, Aviation Weather For Pilots and Flight  Operations Personnel; AC 00‑24, Thunderstorms; AC 00-45,  Aviation Weather Services; AC 91-74, Pilot Guide: Flight in  Icing Conditions; and chapter 7, section 2 of the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM).  

# Effect on Altimeters  

Pressure usually falls rapidly with the approach of a  thunderstorm, rises sharply with the onset of the first gust  and arrival of the cold downdraft and heavy rain showers,  and then falls back to normal as the storm moves on. This  cycle of pressure change may occur in 15 minutes. If the pilot  does not receive a corrected altimeter setting, the altimeter  may be more than 100 feet in error.  

# Lightning  

A lightning strike can puncture the skin of an aircraft  and damage communications and electronic navigational  equipment. Although lightning has been suspected of igniting  fuel vapors and causing an explosion, serious accidents due  to lightning strikes are rare. Nearby lightning can blind the  pilot, rendering him or her momentarily unable to navigate  either by instrument or by visual reference. Nearby lightning  can also induce permanent errors in the magnetic compass.  Lightning discharges, even distant ones, can disrupt radio  communications on low and medium frequencies. Though  lightning intensity and frequency have no simple relationship  to other storm parameters, severe storms, as a rule, have a  high frequency of lightning.  

# Chapter 13 Aviation Weather Services  

# Introduction  

In aviation, weather service is a combined effort of the  National Weather Service (NWS), Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DOD), other  aviation groups, and individuals. Because of the increasing  need for worldwide weather services, foreign weather  organizations also provide vital input.  

While weather forecasts are not 100 percent accurate,  meteorologists, through careful scientific study and computer  modeling, have the ability to predict weather patterns, trends,  and characteristics with increasing accuracy. Through a  complex system of weather services, government agencies,  and independent weather observers, pilots and other aviation  professionals receive the benefit of this vast knowledge base  in the form of up-to-date weather reports and forecasts.  These reports and forecasts enable pilots to make informed  decisions regarding weather and flight safety before and  during a flight.  

![](images/31cd84e13508d02b51bb6d51d0ff5ac75e5b23e188a3bd6075c24bd1e6a3d6d8.jpg)  

# Observations  

The data gathered from surface and upper altitude  observations form the basis of all weather forecasts,  advisories, and briefings. There are four types of weather  observations: surface, upper air, radar, and satellite.  

# Surface Aviation Weather Observations  

Surface aviation weather observations (METARs) are a  compilation of elements of the current weather at individual  ground stations across the United States. The network is  made up of government and privately contracted facilities  that provide continuous up-to-date weather information.  Automated weather sources, such as the Automated Weather  Observing Systems (AWOS), Automated Surface Observing  Systems (ASOS), as well as other automated facilities, also  play a major role in the gathering of surface observations.  

Surface observations provide local weather conditions  and other relevant information for a specific airport. This  information includes the type of report, station identifier,  date and time, modifier (as required), wind, visibility,  runway visual range (RVR), weather phenomena, sky  condition, temperature/dew point, altimeter reading, and  applicable remarks. The information gathered for the surface  observation may be from a person, an automated station, or  an automated station that is updated or enhanced by a weather  observer. In any form, the surface observation provides  valuable information about individual airports around the  country. Although the reports cover only a small radius, the  pilot can generate a good picture of the weather over a wide  area when many reporting stations are viewed together.  

# Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)  

The Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) facilities  are responsible for maintaining separation between flights  conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR) in the en  route structure. Center radars (Air Route Surveillance Radar  (ARSR)) acquire and track transponder returns using the same  basic technology as terminal radars. Earlier center radars  displayed weather as an area of slashes (light precipitation)  and Hs (moderate rainfall). Because the controller could not  detect higher levels of precipitation, pilots had to be wary  of areas showing moderate rainfall. Newer radar displays  show weather as three shades of blue. Controllers can select  the level of weather to be displayed. Weather displays of  higher levels of intensity make it difficult for controllers to  see aircraft data blocks, so pilots should not expect air traffic  control (ATC) to keep weather displayed continuously.  

# Upper Air Observations  

Observations of upper air weather are more challenging  than surface observations. There are several methods by  which upper air weather phenomena can be observed:  

radiosonde observations, pilot weather reports (PIREPs),  Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) and the  Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System  (MDCRS). A radiosonde is a small cubic instrumentation  package that is suspended below a six foot hydrogen- or  helium-filled balloon. Once released, the balloon rises at a rate  of approximately 1,000 feet per minute (fpm). As it ascends,  the instrumentation gathers various pieces of data, such as air  temperature, moisture, and pressure, as well as wind speed  and direction. Once the information is gathered, it is relayed  to ground stations via a 300 milliwatt radio transmitter.  

The balloon flight can last as long as 2 hours or more and  can ascend to altitudes as high as 115,000 feet and drift as  far as 125 miles. The temperatures and pressures experienced  during the flight can be as low as  ${-130~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}}$   and pressures as  low as a few thousandths of what is experienced at sea level.  

Since the pressure decreases as the balloon rises in the  atmosphere, the balloon expands until it reaches the limits  of its elasticity. This point is reached when the diameter has  increased to over 20 feet. At this point, the balloon pops and  the radiosonde falls back to Earth. The descent is slowed by  means of a parachute. The parachute aids in protecting people  and objects on the ground. Each year over 75,000 balloons  are launched. Of that number, 20 percent are recovered and  returned for reconditioning. Return instructions are printed  on the side of each radiosonde.  

Pilots also provide vital information regarding upper air  weather observations and remain the only real-time source  of information regarding turbulence, icing, and cloud  heights. This information is gathered and filed by pilots  in flight. Together, PIREPs and radiosonde observations  provide information on upper air conditions important for  flight planning. Many domestic and international airlines  have equipped their aircraft with instrumentation that  automatically transmits in flight weather observations  through the DataLink system.  

The Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay (AMDAR) is  an international program utilizing commercial aircraft to  provide automated weather observations. The AMDAR  program provides approximately 220,000-230,000 aircraft  observations per day on a worldwide basis utilizing aircraft  onboard sensors and probes that measure wind, temperature,  humidity/water vapor, turbulence and icing data. AMDAR  vertical profiles and en route observations provide significant  benefits to the aviation community by enhancing aircraft  safety and operating efficiency through improved weather  analysis and forecasting. The AMDAR program also  contributes to improved short and medium term numerical  weather forecasts for a wide range of services including  severe weather, defense, marine, public weather and  environmental monitoring. The information is down linked  either via Very High Frequency (VHF) communications  through the Aircraft Communications Addressing and  Reporting System (ACARS) or via satellite link through the  Aircraft to Satellite Data Acquisition and Relay (ASDAR).  

The Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System  (MDCRS) is an automated airborne weather observation  program that is used in the U.S. This program collects and  disseminates real-time upper-air weather observations from  participating airlines. The weather elements are down linked  via ACARS and are managed by Aeronautical Radio, Inc.  (ARINC) who then forwards them in Binary Universal Form  for the Representation of Meteorological Data (BUFR)  format to the NWS and in raw data form to the Earth Science  Research Laboratory (ESRL) and the participating airline.  More than 1,500 aircraft report wind and temperature data  with some of these same aircraft also providing turbulence  and humidity/water vapor information. In conjunction with  avionics manufacturers, each participating airline programs  their equipment to provide certain levels of meteorological  data. The monitoring and collection of climb, en route, and  descent data is accomplished through the aircraft’s Flight Data  Acquisition and Monitoring System (FDAMS) and is then  transmitted via ACARS. When aircraft are out of ACARS  range, reports can be relayed through ASDAR. However, in  most cases, the reports are buffered until the aircraft comes  within ACARS range, at which point they are downloaded.  

# Radar Observations  

There are four types of radars which provide information  about precipitation and wind.  

1.	 The WSR-88D NEXRAD radar, commonly called  Doppler radar, provides in-depth observations that  inform surrounding communities of impending  weather. Doppler radar has two operational modes:  clear air and precipitation. In clear air mode, the radar  is in its most sensitive operational mode because a  slow antenna rotation allows the radar to sample the  atmosphere longer. Images are updated about every  10 minutes in this mode.  

Precipitation targets provide stronger return signals;  therefore, the radar is operated in the Precipitation  mode when precipitation is present. A faster antenna  rotation in this mode allows images to update at  a faster rate, approximately every 4 to 6 minutes.  Intensity values in both modes are measured in  dBZ (decibels of Z) and are depicted in color on the  radar image.  [Figure 13-1]  Intensities are correlated  to intensity terminology (phraseology) for ATC  purposes.  [Figures 13-2  and  13-3]  

![](images/f396a04262059e1505246e8e0251a0da37e5f0b28b691d49d1db078df14bee76.jpg)

2.	 FAA terminal Doppler weather radar (TDWR),  installed at some major airports around the country,  also aids in providing severe weather alerts and  warnings to ATC. Terminal radar ensures pilots  are aware of wind shear, gust fronts, and heavy  precipitation, all of which are dangerous to arriving  and departing aircraft.  3.	 The third type of radar commonly used in the detection  of precipitation is the FAA airport surveillance radar.  This radar is used primarily to detect aircraft, but it  also detects the location and intensity of precipitation,  which is used to route aircraft traffic around severe  weather in an airport environment. 4. 	 Airborne radar is equipment carried by aircraft to  locate weather disturbances. The airborne radars  generally operate in the C or   $\mathrm{X}$   bands (around 6  GHz or around   $10\ \mathrm{GHz}$  , respectively) permitting  both penetration of heavy precipitation, required for  determining the extent of thunderstorms, and sufficient  reflection from less intense precipitation.  

# Satellite  

Advancement in satellite technologies has recently allowed  for commercial use to include weather uplinks. Through the  use of satellite subscription services, individuals are now able  to receive satellite transmitted signals that provide near real- time weather information for the North American continent.  

# Service Outlets  

Service outlets are government, government contract, or  private facilities that provide aviation weather services. Several  different government agencies, including the FAA, National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the  NWS work in conjunction with private aviation companies  to provide different means of accessing weather information.  

# Flight Service Station (FSS)  

The FSS is the primary source for preflight weather  information. A preflight weather briefing from an FSS can be  obtained 24 hours a day by calling 1-800-WX BRIEF from  anywhere in the United States and Puerto Rico. Telephone  numbers for FSS can be found in the Chart Supplement U.S.  (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) or in the United States  Government section of the telephone book.  

The FSS also provides inflight weather briefing services  and weather advisories to flights within the FSS area of  responsibility.  

# Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS)  

The Telephone Information Briefing Service (TIBS),  provided by FSS, is a system of automated telephone  recordings of meteorological and aeronautical information.  TIBS provides area and route briefings, airspace procedures,  and special announcements. The recordings are automatically  updated as changes occur. It is designed to be a preliminary  briefing tool and is not intended to replace a standard briefing  from a FSS specialist. The TIBS service can only be accessed  by a touchtone phone. The phone numbers for the TIBS  service are listed in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly  Airport/Facility Directory).  

# Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service  (HIWAS)  

Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS),  available in the 48 conterminous states, is an automated  continuous broadcast of hazardous weather information  over selected VOR navigational aids (NAVAIDs). The  broadcasts include advisories such as AIRMETS, SIGMETS,  convective SIGMETS, and urgent PIREPs. The broadcasts  are automatically updated as changes occur. Pilots should  contact a FSS or EFAS for additional information. VORs that  have HIWAS capability are depicted on aeronautical charts  with an “H” in the upper right corner of the identification  box.  [Figure 13-4]  

# Transcribed Weather Broadcast (TWEB) (Alaska  Only)  

A continuous automated broadcast of meteorological and  aeronautical data over selected low or medium frequency (L/ MF) and very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range  (VOR) NAVAID facilities. The broadcasts are automatically  updated as changes occur. The broadcast contains adverse  conditions, surface weather observations, PIREPS, and  a density altitude statement (if applicable). Recordings  may also include a synopsis, winds aloft forecast, en route  and terminal forecast data, and radar reports. At selected  locations, telephone access to the TWEB has been provided  (TEL-TWEB). Telephone numbers for this service are found  

![](images/35e14b9d6d4baf1b4714fb5c7fb1e2f82990c73f8c7f8957e0eece0c555fad12.jpg)  
Figure 13-4.  HIWAS availability is shown on sectional chart.  

in the Alaska Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/ Facility Directory). These broadcasts are made available  primarily for preflight and inflight planning, and as such,  should not be considered as a substitute for specialist- provided preflight briefings.  

# Weather Briefings  

Prior to every flight, pilots should gather all information  vital to the nature of the flight. This includes an appropriate  weather briefing obtained from a specialist at a FSS.  

For weather specialists to provide an appropriate weather  briefing, they need to know which of the three types of  briefings is needed—standard, abbreviated, or outlook. Other  helpful information is whether the flight is visual flight rules  (VFR) or IFR, aircraft identification and type, departure  point, estimated time of departure (ETD), flight altitude, route  of flight, destination, and estimated time en route (ETE).  

This information is recorded in the flight plan system and a  note is made regarding the type of weather briefing provided.  If necessary, it can be referenced later to file or amend a  flight plan. It is also used when an aircraft is overdue or is  reported missing.  

# Standard Briefing  

A standard briefing provides the most complete information  and a more complete weather picture. This type of briefing  should be obtained prior to the departure of any flight and  should be used during flight planning. A standard briefing  provides the following information in sequential order if it  is applicable to the route of flight.  

1.	 Adverse conditions—this includes information about  adverse conditions that may influence a decision to  cancel or alter the route of flight. Adverse conditions  include significant weather, such as thunderstorms or  aircraft icing, or other important items such as airport  closings. 2.	 VFR flight not recommended—if the weather for  the route of flight is below VFR minimums, or if  it is doubtful the flight could be made under VFR  conditions due to the forecast weather, the briefer may  state “VFR flight not recommended.” It is the pilot’s  decision whether or not to continue the flight under  VFR, but this advisory should be weighed carefully. 3.	 Synopsis—an overview of the larger weather picture.  Fronts and major weather systems that affect the  general area are provided. 4.	 Current conditions—the current ceilings, visibility,  winds, and temperatures. If the departure time is more  than 2 hours away, current conditions are not included  in the briefing.  

5.	 En route forecast—a summary of the weather forecast  for the proposed route of flight. 6.	 Destination forecast—a summary of the expected  weather for the destination airport at the estimated  time of arrival (ETA). 7.	 Forecast winds and temperatures aloft—a forecast of  the winds at specific altitudes for the route of flight.  The forecast temperature information aloft is provided  only upon request. 8.	 Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)—information pertinent  to the route of flight that has not been published in the  NOTAM publication. Published NOTAM information  is provided during the briefing only when requested. 9.	 ATC delays—an advisory of any known ATC delays  that may affect the flight. 10.	 Other information—at the end of the standard briefing,  the FSS specialist provides the radio frequencies  needed to open a flight plan and to contact EFAS. Any  additional information requested is also provided at  this time.  

# Abbreviated Briefing  

An abbreviated briefing is a shortened version of the standard  briefing. It should be requested when a departure has been  delayed or when weather information is needed to update  the previous briefing. When this is the case, the weather  specialist needs to know the time and source of the previous  briefing so the necessary weather information is not omitted  inadvertently. It is always a good idea for the pilot to update  the weather information whenever he/she has additional time.  

# Outlook Briefing  

An outlook briefing should be requested when a planned  departure is 6 hours or more away. It provides initial forecast  information that is limited in scope due to the time frame  of the planned flight. This type of briefing is a good source  of flight planning information that can influence decisions  regarding route of flight, altitude, and ultimately the go/no-go  decision. A prudent pilot requests a follow-up briefing prior  to departure since an outlook briefing generally only contains  information based on weather trends and existing weather in  geographical areas at or near the departure airport. A standard  briefing near the time of departure ensures that the pilot has  the latest information available prior to his/her flight.  

# Aviation Weather Reports  

Aviation weather reports are designed to give accurate  depictions of current weather conditions. Each report  provides current information that is updated at different times.  Some typical reports are METARs and PIREPs.  

# Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)  

A METAR is an observation of current surface weather  reported in a standard international format. While the  METAR code has been adopted worldwide, each country is  allowed to make modifications to the code. Normally, these  differences are minor but necessary to accommodate local  procedures or particular units of measure. This discussion of  METAR covers elements used in the United States.  

METARs are issued on a regularly scheduled basis unless  significant weather changes have occurred. A special  METAR (SPECI) can be issued at any time between routine  METAR reports.  

Example: METAR KGGG 161753Z AUTO 14021G26KT 3/4SM $+\dot{}$  TSRA BR BKN008 OVC012CB 18/17 A2970 RMK PRESFR  

A typical METAR report contains the following information  in sequential order:  

1.	 Type of report—there are two types of METAR  reports. The first is the routine METAR report that is  transmitted on a regular time interval. The second is  the aviation selected SPECI. This is a special report  that can be given at any time to update the METAR for  rapidly changing weather conditions, aircraft mishaps,  or other critical information.  

2.	 Station identifier—a four-letter code as established by  the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  In the 48 contiguous states, a unique three-letter  identifier is preceded by the letter “K.” For example,  Gregg County Airport in Longview, Texas, is  identified by the letters “KGGG,” K being the country  designation and GGG being the airport identifier.  In other regions of the world, including Alaska and  Hawaii, the first two letters of the four-letter ICAO  identifier indicate the region, country, or state. Alaska  identifiers always begin with the letters “PA” and  Hawaii identifiers always begin with the letters “PH.”  Station identifiers can be found by calling the FSS, a  NWS office, or by searching various websites such  as DUATS and NOAA's Aviation Weather Aviation  Digital Data Services (ADDS).  

3.	 Date and time of report—depicted in a six-digit group  (161753Z). The first two digits are the date. The last  four digits are the time of the METAR/SPECI, which  is always given in coordinated universal time (UTC).  A “Z” is appended to the end of the time to denote  the time is given in Zulu time (UTC) as opposed to  local time.  

4.	 Modifier—denotes that the METAR/SPECI came from  an automated source or that the report was corrected. If  the notation “AUTO” is listed in the METAR/SPECI,  the report came from an automated source. It also lists  “AO1” (for no precipitation discriminator) or “AO2”  (with precipitation discriminator) in the “Remarks”  section to indicate the type of precipitation sensors  employed at the automated station.  

When the modifier “COR” is used, it identifies a  corrected report sent out to replace an earlier report  that contained an error (for example:   METAR KGGG  161753Z COR).  

5.	 Wind—reported with five digits (14021KT) unless  the speed is greater than 99 knots, in which case the  wind is reported with six digits. The first three digits  indicate the direction the true wind is blowing from in  tens of degrees. If the wind is variable, it is reported  as “VRB.” The last two digits indicate the speed of  the wind in knots unless the wind is greater than 99  knots, in which case it is indicated by three digits. If  the winds are gusting, the letter “G” follows the wind  speed (G26KT). After the letter “G,” the peak gust  recorded is provided. If the wind direction varies more  than  $60^{\circ}$   and the wind speed is greater than six knots,  a separate group of numbers, separated by a “V,” will  indicate the extremes of the wind directions.  

6.	 Visibility—the prevailing visibility  $(\%\,\mathrm{SM})$   is reported  in statute miles as denoted by the letters “SM.” It is  reported in both miles and fractions of miles. At times,  runway visual range (RVR) is reported following the  prevailing visibility. RVR is the distance a pilot can  see down the runway in a moving aircraft. When RVR  is reported, it is shown with an R, then the runway  number followed by a slant, then the visual range  in feet. For example, when the RVR is reported as  R17L/1400FT, it translates to a visual range of 1,400  feet on runway 17 left.  

7.	 Weather—can be broken down into two different  categories: qualifiers and weather phenomenon  (  $^+$  TSRA BR). First, the qualifiers of intensity,  proximity, and the descriptor of the weather are given.  The intensity may be light  $(-)$  , moderate ( ), or heavy   $(+)$  . Proximity only depicts weather phenomena that  are in the airport vicinity. The notation “VC” indicates  a specific weather phenomenon is in the vicinity  of five to ten miles from the airport. Descriptors  are used to describe certain types of precipitation  and obscurations. Weather phenomena may be  reported as being precipitation, obscurations, and  other phenomena, such as squalls or funnel clouds.  Descriptions of weather phenomena as they begin or  end and hailstone size are also listed in the “Remarks”  sections of the report.  [Figure 13-5]  

8.	 Sky condition—always reported in the sequence of amount, height, and type or indefinite ceiling/height (vertical visibility) (BKN008 OVC012CB, VV003). The heights of the cloud bases are reported with a three-digit number in hundreds of feet AGL. Clouds above 12,000 feet are not detected or reported by an automated station. The types of clouds, specifically towering cumulus (TCU) or cumulonimbus (CB) clouds, are reported with their height. Contractions are used to describe the amount of cloud coverage and  obscuring phenomena. The amount of sky coverage is  reported in eighths of the sky from horizon to horizon.  [Figure 13-6]  

9.	 Temperature and dew point—the air temperature and dew point are always given in degrees Celsius (C) or (18/17). Temperatures below   $0\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$   are preceded by the letter “M” to indicate minus.  

10.	 Altimeter setting—reported as inches of mercury  $({}^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   in a four-digit number group (A2970). It is always preceded by the letter “A.” Rising or falling pressure may also be denoted in the “Remarks” sections as “PRESRR” or “PRESFR,” respectively.  

11.	 Zulu time—a term used in aviation for UTC, which places the entire world on one time standard.  

![Figure 13-6.  Reportable contractions for sky condition. ](images/a926b1e936b7e9694e49e863112bab6c480c591d95460ae302f9bd8271694c6e.jpg)  

12.	 Remarks—the remarks section always begins with the  letters “RMK.” Comments may or may not appear in this section of the METAR. The information contained  in this section may include wind data, variable visibility, beginning and ending times of particular phenomenon, pressure information, and various other  information deemed necessary. An example of a remark regarding weather phenomenon that does not fit in any other category would be: OCNL LTGICCG.  This translates as occasional lightning in the clouds and from cloud to ground. Automated stations also use  the remarks section to indicate the equipment needs maintenance.  

Example: METAR KGGG 161753Z AUTO 14021G26KT 3/4SM+TSRA BR BKN008 OVC012CB 18/17 A2970 RMK PRESFR

Explanation:  

Routine METAR for Gregg County Airport for the 16th  day of the month at 1753Z automated source. Winds are  140 at 21 knots gusting to 26. Visibility is   $\%$   statute mile.  Thunderstorms with heavy rain and mist. Ceiling is broken  at 800 feet, overcast at 1,200 feet with cumulonimbus clouds.  Temperature  $18\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and dew point  $17\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Barometric pressure  is   $29.70~"\mathrm{Hg}$   and falling rapidly.  

# Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs)  

PIREPs provide valuable information regarding the  conditions as they actually exist in the air, which cannot be  gathered from any other source. Pilots can confirm the height  of bases and tops of clouds, locations of wind shear and  turbulence, and the location of inflight icing. If the ceiling is  below 5,000 feet, or visibility is at or below five miles, ATC  facilities are required to solicit PIREPs from pilots in the area.  When unexpected weather conditions are encountered, pilots  are encouraged to make a report to a FSS or ATC. When a  pilot weather report is filed, the ATC facility or FSS adds it  to the distribution system to brief other pilots and provide  inflight advisories.  

PIREPs are easy to file and a standard reporting form outlines  the manner in which they should be filed.  Figure 13-7  shows  the elements of a PIREP form. Item numbers 1 through 5 are  required information when making a report, as well as at least  one weather phenomenon encountered. A PIREP is normally  transmitted as an individual report but may be appended to  a surface report. Pilot reports are easily decoded, and most  contractions used in the reports are self-explanatory.  

Example: UA/OV GGG 090025/TM 1450/FL 060/TP C182/SK 080 OVC/WX FV04SM RA/TA 05/WV 270030KT/TB  LGT/RM HVY RAIN

# Aviation Forecasts  

Observed weather condition reports are often used in the  creation of forecasts for the same area. A variety of different  forecast products are produced and designed to be used in the  preflight planning stage. The printed forecasts that pilots need  to be familiar with are the terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF),  aviation area forecast (FA), inflight weather advisories  (SIGMET, AIRMET), and the winds and temperatures aloft  forecast (FB).  

# Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF)  

A TAF is a report established for the five statute mile  radius around an airport. TAF reports are usually given for  larger airports. Each TAF is valid for a 24 or 30-hour time  period and is updated four times a day at 0000Z, 0600Z,  1200Z, and 1800Z. The TAF utilizes the same descriptors  and abbreviations as used in the METAR report. The TAF  includes the following information in sequential order:  

1.	 Type of report—a TAF can be either a routine forecast  (TAF) or an amended forecast (TAF AMD). 2.	 ICAO station identifier—the station identifier is the  same as that used in a METAR. 3.	 Date and time of origin—time and date (081125Z)  of TAF origination is given in the six-number code  with the first two being the date, the last four being  the time. Time is always given in UTC as denoted by  the Z following the time block. 4.	 Valid period dates and times—The TAF valid period  (0812/0912) follows the date/time of forecast origin  group. Scheduled 24 and 30 hour TAFs are issued  four times per day, at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800Z.  The first two digits (08) are the day of the month for  the start of the TAF. The next two digits (12) are the  starting hour (UTC). 09 is the day of the month for  the end of the TAF, and the last two digits (12) are  the ending hour (UTC) of the valid period. A forecast  period that begins at midnight UTC is annotated as 00.  If the end time of a valid period is at midnight UTC,  it is annotated as 24. For example, a 00Z TAF issued  on the 9th of the month and valid for 24 hours would  have a valid period of 0900/0924. 5.	 Forecast wind—the wind direction and speed forecast  are coded in a five-digit number group. An example  would be 15011KT. The first three digits indicate the  direction of the wind in reference to true north. The  last two digits state the windspeed in knots appended  with “KT.” Like the METAR, winds greater than 99  knots are given in three digits. 6.	 Forecast visibility—given in statute miles and may  be in whole numbers or fractions. If the forecast is  greater than six miles, it is coded as “P6SM.”  

7.	 Forecast significant weather—weather phenomena  are coded in the TAF reports in the same format as  the METAR.  8.	 Forecast sky condition—given in the same format as  the METAR. Only cumulonimbus (CB) clouds are  forecast in this portion of the TAF report as opposed  to CBs and towering cumulus in the METAR. 9.	 Forecast change group—for any significant weather  change forecast to occur during the TAF time period,  the expected conditions and time period are included  in this group. This information may be shown as from  (FM), and temporary (TEMPO). “FM” is used when a  rapid and significant change, usually within an hour, is  expected. “TEMPO” is used for temporary fluctuations  of weather, expected to last less than 1 hour.  10.	 PROB30—a given percentage that describes the  probability of thunderstorms and precipitation  occurring in the coming hours. This forecast is not  used for the first 6 hours of the 24-hour forecast.

# Area Forecasts (FA)  

The FA gives a picture of clouds, general weather conditions,  and visual meteorological conditions (VMC) expected over  a large area encompassing several states. There are six areas  for which area forecasts are published in the contiguous 48  states. Area forecasts are issued three times a day and are  valid for 18 hours. This type of forecast gives information  vital to en route operations, as well as forecast information  for smaller airports that do not have terminal forecasts.  

Area forecasts are typically disseminated in four sections and  include the following information:  

1.	 Header—gives the location identifier of the source of  the FA, the date and time of issuance, the valid forecast  time, and the area of coverage.  

Example: DFWC FA 120945 SYNOPSIS AND VFR CLDS/WX SYNOPSIS VALID UNTIL 130400 CLDS/WX VALID UNTIL 122200…OTLK VALID 122200-130400 OK TX AR LA MS AL AND CSTL WTRS  

# Explanation:  

The area forecast shows information given by Dallas Fort  Worth, for the region of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas,  Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, as well as a portion  of the Gulf coastal waters. It was issued on the 12th day  of the month at 0945. The synopsis is valid from the time  of issuance until 0400 hours on the 13th. VFR clouds and  weather information on this area forecast are valid until 2200  hours on the 12th and the outlook is valid from 2200Z on the  12th to 0400Z on the 13th.  

2.	 Precautionary statements—IFR conditions, mountain  obscurations, and thunderstorm hazards are described  in this section. Statements made here regarding height  are given in MSL, and if given otherwise, AGL or  ceiling (CIG) is noted.  

Example:  

SEE AIRMET SIERRA FOR IFR CONDS AND MTN  

OBSCN. TS IMPLY SEV OR GTR TURB SEV ICE LLWS AND  IFR CONDS. NON MSL HGTS DENOTED BYAGL OR CIG.  

# Explanation:  

The area forecast covers VFR clouds and weather, so the  precautionary statement warns that AIRMET Sierra should  be referenced for IFR conditions and mountain obscuration.  The code TS indicates the possibility of thunderstorms  and implies there may be occurrences of severe or greater  turbulence, severe icing, low-level wind shear, and IFR  conditions. The final line of the precautionary statement alerts  the user that heights, for the most part, are MSL. Those that  are not MSL will state AGL or CIG.  

3.	 Synopsis—gives a brief summary identifying the  location and movement of pressure systems, fronts,  and circulation patterns.  

Example:  

SYNOPSIS…LOW PRES TROF 10Z OK/TX PNHDL AREA  FCST MOV EWD INTO CNTRL-SWRN OK BY 04Z.  WRMFNT 10Z CNTRL OK-SRN AR-NRN MS FCST LIFT  NWD INTO NERN OK-NRN AR EXTRM NRN MS BY 04Z.  

# Explanation:  

As of 1000Z, there is a low pressure trough over the Oklahoma  and Texas panhandle area, which is forecast to move eastward  into central to southwestern Oklahoma by 0400Z. A warm  front located over central Oklahoma, southern Arkansas, and  northern Mississippi at 1000Z is forecast to lift northwestward  into northeastern Oklahoma, northern Arkansas, and extreme  northern Mississippi by 0400Z.  

4.	 VFR Clouds and Weather—This section lists expected  sky conditions, visibility, and weather for the next 12  hours and an outlook for the following 6 hours.  

Example: S CNTRL AND SERN TX AGL SCT-BKN010. TOPS 030. VIS 3-5SM BR. 14-16Z BECMG AGL SCT030. 19Z AGL SCT050. OTLK…VFR OK PNDLAND NW…AGL SCT030 SCT-BKN100. TOPS FL200. 15Z AGL SCT040 SCT100. AFT 20Z SCT TSRA DVLPG.. FEW POSS SEV. CB TOPS FL450. OTLK…VFR  

Explanation:  

In south central and southeastern Texas, there is a scattered  to broken layer of clouds from 1,000 feet AGL with tops at  3,000 feet, visibility is 3 to 5 SM in mist. Between 1400Z and  1600Z, the cloud bases are expected to increase to 3,000 feet  AGL. After 1900Z, the cloud bases are expected to continue  to increase to 5,000 feet AGL and the outlook is VFR.  

In northwestern Oklahoma and panhandle, the clouds are  scattered at 3,000 feet with another scattered to broken layer  at 10,000 feet AGL, with the tops at 20,000 feet. At 1500  Z, the lowest cloud base is expected to increase to 4,000  feet AGL with a scattered layer at 10,000 feet AGL. After  2000Z, the forecast calls for scattered thunderstorms with rain  developing and a few becoming severe; the CB clouds have  tops at flight level (FL) 450 or 45,000 feet MSL.  

It should be noted that when information is given in the area  forecast, locations may be given by states, regions, or specific  geological features such as mountain ranges.  Figure 13-8 shows an area forecast chart with six regions of forecast,  states, regional areas, and common geographical features.  

# Inflight Weather Advisories  

Inflight weather advisories, which are provided to en route  aircraft, are forecasts that detail potentially hazardous  weather. These advisories are also available to pilots prior  to departure for flight planning purposes. An inflight  weather advisory is issued in the form of either an AIRMET,  SIGMET, or convective SIGMET.  

# AIRMET  

AIRMETs (WAs) are examples of inflight weather advisories  that are issued every 6 hours with intermediate updates  issued as needed for a particular area forecast region. The  information contained in an AIRMET is of operational  interest to all aircraft, but the weather section concerns  phenomena considered potentially hazardous to light aircraft  and aircraft with limited operational capabilities.  

An AIRMET includes forecast of moderate icing, moderate  turbulence, sustained surface winds of 30 knots or  greater, widespread areas of ceilings less than 1,000 feet  and/or visibilities less than three miles, and extensive  mountain obscurement.  

Each AIRMET bulletin has a fixed alphanumeric designator,  numbered sequentially for easy identification, beginning with  the first issuance of the day. Sierra is the AIRMET code used  to denote IFR and mountain obscuration; Tango is used to  denote turbulence, strong surface winds, and low-level wind  shear; and Zulu is used to denote icing and freezing levels.

# Explanation:  

AIRMET SIERRA was issued for the Boston area at 1945Z  on the 21st day of the month. SIERRA contains information  on IFR and/or mountain obscurations. This is the third  updated issuance of this Boston AIRMET series as indicated  by “SIERRA UPDT   $_{3}{\mathrm{"}}$   and is valid until 0200Z on the   $22{\mathrm{nd}}$  . The affected states within the BOS area are: Maine,  New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, and  Pennsylvania. Within an area bounded by: Caribou, ME;  to Saint Johns, New Brunswick; to 150 nautical miles east  of Nantucket, MA; to Newark, NJ; to Ottawa, Ontario;  to Caribou, ME. The effected states within Caribou, ME  to Millinocket, ME to Concord, NH to Slate Run, PA to  Syracuse, NY to Caribou, ME will experience ceilings  below 1,000 feet/visibility below 3 SM, precipitation/mist.  Conditions will continue beyond 0200Z through 0800Z.  

# SIGMET  

SIGMETs (WSs) are inflight advisories concerning non- convective weather that is potentially hazardous to all  aircraft. They report weather forecasts that include severe  icing not associated with thunderstorms, severe or extreme  turbulence or clear air turbulence (CAT) not associated with  thunderstorms, dust storms or sandstorms that lower surface  or inflight visibilities to below three miles, and volcanic ash.  SIGMETs are unscheduled forecasts that are valid for 4 hours  unless the SIGMET relates to a hurricane, in which case it  is valid for 6 hours.  

A SIGMET is issued under an alphabetic identifier, from  November through Yankee. The first issuance of a SIGMET  is designated as an Urgent Weather SIGMET (UWS).  Reissued SIGMETs for the same weather phenomenon are  sequentially numbered until the weather phenomenon ends.  

Example: SFOR WS 100130 SIGMET ROME02 VALID UNTIL 100530 OR WA FROM SEA TO PDT TO EUG TO SEA OCNL SEV CAT BTN FL280 AND FL350 EXPCD DUE TO JTSTR.  CONDS BGNG AFT 0200Z CONTG BYD 0530Z .  

Explanation: This is SIGMET Romeo 2, the second issuance for this  weather phenomenon. It is valid until the 10th day of the  month at 0530Z time. This SIGMET is for Oregon and  Washington, for a defined area from Seattle to Portland to  Eugene to Seattle. It calls for occasional severe clear air  turbulence between FL280 and FL350 due to the location of  the jet stream. These conditions will begin after 0200Z and  continue beyond the forecast scope of this SIGMET of 0530Z.  

# Convective Significant Meteorological Information  (WST)  

A Convective SIGMET (WST) is an inflight weather  advisory issued for hazardous convective weather that affects  the safety of every flight. Convective SIGMETs are issued  for severe thunderstorms with surface winds greater than 50  knots, hail at the surface greater than or equal to  $\%$   inch in  diameter, or tornadoes. They are also issued to advise pilots  of embedded thunderstorms, lines of thunderstorms, or  thunderstorms with heavy or greater precipitation that affect  40 percent or more of a 3,000 square mile or greater region.  

Convective SIGMETs are issued for each area of the  contiguous 48 states but not Alaska or Hawaii. Convective  SIGMETs are issued for the eastern (E), western (W), and  central (C) United States. Each report is issued at 55 minutes  past the hour, but special Convective SIGMETs can be  issued during the interim for any reason. Each forecast is  valid for 2 hours. They are numbered sequentially each day  from 1–99, beginning at 00Z time. If no hazardous weather  exists, the convective SIGMET is still issued; however, it  states “CONVECTIVE SIGMET…NONE.”  

Example: MKCC WST 221855 CONVECTIVE SIGMET 20C VALID UNTIL 2055Z ND SD FROM 90W MOT-GFK-ABR-90W MOT INTSFYG AREA SEV TS MOVG FROM 24045KT. TOPS ABV FL450. WIND GUSTS TO 60KTS RPRTD. TORNADOES…HAIL TO 2 IN… WIND GUSTS TO  65KTS POSS ND PTN  

# Explanation:  

Convective SIGMET was issued for the central portion of  the United States on the   $22\mathrm{nd}$   at 1855Z. This is the 20th  Convective SIGMET issued on the 22nd for the central  United States as indicated by  $^{**}\!{}^{20C^{*}}\!$   and is valid until 2055Z.  The affected states are North and South Dakota, from 90  nautical miles west of Minot, ND; to Grand Forks, ND; to  Aberdeen, SD; to 90 nautical miles west of Minot, ND. An  intensifying area of severe thunderstorms moving from 240  degrees at 45 knots (to the northeast). Thunderstorm tops will  be above FL 450. Wind gusts up to 60 knots were reported.  

Also reported were tornadoes, hail to 2 inches in diameter, and  wind gusts to 65 knots possible in the North Dakota portion.  

# Winds and Temperature Aloft Forecast (FB)  

Winds and temperatures aloft forecasts (FB) provide wind  and temperature forecasts for specific locations throughout  the United States, including network locations in Hawaii  and Alaska. The forecasts are made twice a day based on the  radiosonde upper air observations taken at 0000Z and 1200Z.  

Altitudes through 12,000 feet are classified as true altitudes,  while altitudes 18,000 feet and above are classified as  altitudes and are termed flight levels. Wind direction is  always in reference to true north, and wind speed is given in  knots. The temperature is given in degrees Celsius. No winds  are forecast when a given level is within 1,500 feet of the  station elevation. Similarly, temperatures are not forecast for  any station within 2,500 feet of the station elevation.  

If the wind speed is forecast to be greater than 99 knots but  less than 199 knots, the computer adds 50 to the direction  and subtracts 100 from the speed. To decode this type of data  group, the reverse must be accomplished. For example, when  the data appears as “731960,” subtract 50 from the 73 and  add 100 to the 19, and the wind would be  $230^{\circ}$   at 119 knots  with a temperature of  $-60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . If the wind speed is forecast to  be 200 knots or greater, the wind group is coded as 99 knots.  For example, when the data appears as “7799,” subtract 50  from 77 and add 100 to 99, and the wind is  $270^{\circ}$   at 199 knots  or greater. When the forecast wind speed is calm, or less than  5 knots, the data group is coded “9900,” which means light  and variable.  [Figure 13-9]  

# Explanation of  Figure 13-9:  

The heading indicates that this FB was transmitted on the  15th of the month at 1640Z and is based on the 1200Z upper  air data. The valid time is 1800Z on the same day and should  be used for the period between 1400Z and 2100Z. The  heading also indicates that the temperatures above FL240  are negative. Therefore, the minus sign will be omitted for  all forecast temperatures above FL240.  

A four-digit data group shows the wind direction in reference  to true north and the wind speed in knots. The elevation at  Amarillo, Texas (AMA) is 3,605 feet, so the lowest reportable

altitude is 6,000 feet for the forecast winds. In this case,  “2714” means the wind is forecast to be from  $270^{\circ}$   at a speed  of 14 knots.  

A six-digit group includes the forecast temperature aloft.  The elevation at Denver (DEN) is 5,431 feet, so the lowest  reportable altitude is 9,000 feet for the winds and temperature  forecast. In this case, “2321-04” indicates the wind is forecast to  be from  $230^{\circ}$   at a speed of 21 knots with a temperature of  $-4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  

# Weather Charts  

Weather charts are graphic charts that depict current or  forecast weather. They provide an overall picture of the  United States and should be used in the beginning stages of  flight planning. Typically, weather charts show the movement  of major weather systems and fronts. Surface analysis,  weather depiction, and significant weather prognostic charts  are sources of current weather information. Significant  weather prognostic charts provide an overall forecast weather  picture.  

# Surface Analysis Chart  

The surface analysis chart depicts an analysis of the current  surface weather.  [Figure 13-10]  This chart is transmitted  every 3 hours and covers the contiguous 48 states and  adjacent areas. A surface analysis chart shows the areas of  high and low pressure, fronts, temperatures, dew points, wind  directions and speeds, local weather, and visual obstructions. Surface weather observations for reporting points across  the United States are also depicted on this chart. Each of  these reporting points is illustrated by a station model.  [Figure 13-11]  A station model includes:  

•	 Sky cover—the station model depicts total sky cover  and is shown as clear, scattered, broken, overcast, or  obscured/partially obscured. •	 Sea level pressure—given in three digits to the nearest  tenth of a millibar (mb). For   $1{,}000~\mathrm{{mbs}}$   or greater,  prefix a 10 to the three digits. For less than   $1{,}000\,\mathrm{mbs}$  ,  prefix a 9 to the three digits. •	 Pressure change/tendency—pressure change in tenths  of mb over the past 3 hours. This is depicted directly  below the sea level pressure. •	 Dew point—given in degrees Fahrenheit.  •	 Present weather—over 100 different standard weather  symbols are used to describe the current weather. •	 Temperature—given in degrees Fahrenheit. •	 Wind—true direction of wind is given by the wind  pointer line, indicating the direction from which the  wind is blowing. A short barb is equal to 5 knots of  wind, a long barb is equal to 10 knots of wind, and a  pennant is equal to 50 knots.

Figure 13-11.  Sample station model and weather chart symbols.  

# Weather Depiction Chart  

A weather depiction chart details surface conditions as  derived from METAR and other surface observations. The  weather depiction chart is prepared and transmitted by  computer every 3 hours beginning at 0100Z time and is valid  data for the forecast period. It is designed to be used for flight  planning by giving an overall picture of the weather across  the United States.  [Figure 13-12]  

The weather depiction chart also provides a graphic display  of IFR, VFR, and marginal VFR (MVFR) weather. Areas of  IFR conditions (ceilings less than 1,000 feet and visibility  less than three miles) are shown by a hatched area outlined  by a smooth line. MVFR regions (ceilings 1,000 to 3,000  feet, visibility 3 to 5 miles) are shown by a nonhatched area  outlined by a smooth line. Areas of VFR (no ceiling or ceiling  greater than 3,000 feet and visibility greater than five miles)  are not outlined. Also plotted are fronts, troughs, and squall  lines from the previous hours surface analysis chart.  

Weather depiction charts show a modified station model  that provides sky conditions in the form of total sky cover,  ceiling height, weather, and obstructions to visibility, but  does not include winds or pressure readings like the surface  analysis chart. A bracket ( ] ) symbol to the right of the station  indicates the observation was made by an automated station.  

# Significant Weather Prognostic Charts  

Significant weather prognostic charts are available for low- level significant weather from the surface to FL 240 (24,000  feet), also referred to as the   $400~\mathrm{{mb}}$   level and high-level  significant weather from FL 250 to FL 630 (25,000 to 63,000  feet). The primary concern of this discussion is the low-level  significant weather prognostic chart.  

The low-level chart is is a forecast of aviation weather  hazards, primarily intended to be used as a guidance product  for briefing the VFR pilot. The forecast domain covers the 48  contiguous states, southern Canada and the coastal waters for  altitudes below 24,000 ft. Low altitude Significant Weather  charts are issued four times daily and are valid at fixed times:  0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. Each chart is divided on  the left and right into 12 and 24 hour forecast intervals (based  on the current NAM model available).  

![](images/a080a0f67b9994b14fc553f37335035e7bbdf980910930a4fa9b7daf7489e915.jpg)  

Effective September 1, 2015, the four-panel Low Level  SFC-240 chart was replaced with a two-panel chart. The new  two-panel chart will be the same as the top two panels in the  former four-panel chart, depicting the freezing level and areas  of IFR, MVFR, and moderate or greater turbulence. The bottom  two panels of the chart have been removed. In lieu of these  bottom two panels, an enhanced surface chart that includes  fronts, pressure, precipitation type, precipitation intensity, and  weather type, is displayed. The green precipitation polygons  will be replaced by shaded precipitation areas using the  National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) weather grid.  

Figure 13-13  depicts the new two-panel significant weather  prognostic chart, as well as the symbols typically used to  depict precipitation. The two panels depict freezing levels,  turbulence, and low cloud ceilings and/or restrictions to  visibility (shown as contoured areas of MVFR and IFR  conditions). These charts enable the pilot to pictorially  evaluate existing and potential weather hazards they may  encounter. Pilots can balance weather phenomena with  their aircraft capability and skill set resulting in aeronautical  decision-making appropriate to the flight. Prognostic charts  are an excellent source of information for preflight planning;  however, this chart should be viewed in light of current  conditions and specific local area forecasts.  

The 36- and 48-hour significant weather prognostic chart is  an extension of the 12- and 24-hour forecast. This chart is  issued twice a day. It typically contains forecast positions and  characteristics of pressure patterns, fronts, and precipitation.  An example of a 36- and 48-hour surface prognostic chart is  shown in  Figure 13-14 .  

# ATC Radar Weather Displays  

Although ATC systems cannot always detect the presence  or absence of clouds, they can often determine the intensity  of a precipitation area, but the specific character of that area  (snow, rain, hail, VIRGA, etc.) cannot be determined. For  this reason, ATC refers to all weather areas displayed on ATC  radar scopes as “precipitation.”  

ARTCC facilities normally use a Weather and Radar  Processor (WARP) to display a mosaic of data obtained  from multiple NEXRAD sites. There is a time delay between  actual conditions and those displayed to the controller.  The precipitation data on the ARTCC controller’s display  could be up to 6 minutes old. The WARP processor is only  used in ARTCC facilities. All ATC facilities using radar  weather processors with the ability to determine precipitation  intensity, describe the intensity to pilots as:  

•	 Light • 	 Moderate • 	 Heavy •	 Extreme  

When the WARP is not available, a second system, the  narrowband Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) can  display two distinct levels of precipitation intensity that  is described to pilots as “MODERATE and “HEAVY TO  EXTREME.”  

ATC facilities that cannot display the intensity levels of  precipitation due to equipment limitations describe the  location of the precipitation area by geographic position or  position relative to the aircraft. Since the intensity level is not  available, the controller states “INTENSITY UNKNOWN.”  

ATC radar is not able to detect turbulence. Generally,  turbulence can be expected to occur as the rate of rainfall or  intensity of precipitation increases. Turbulence associated  with greater rates of precipitation is normally more severe than  

![](images/1c637ae63d4bb3ced32eb80673fa540203c99441548c5e1b9f36510b42c3f36e.jpg)  
Figure 13-13.   Significant weather prognostic chart.

Figure 13-14.  36- (top) and 48-hour (bottom) surface prognostic chart.  

any associated with lesser rates of precipitation. Turbulence  should be expected to occur near convective activity, even  in clear air. Thunderstorms are a form of convective activity  that imply severe or greater turbulence. Operation within  20 miles of thunderstorms should be approached with great  caution, as the severity of turbulence can be much greater than  the precipitation intensity might indicate.  

# Weather Avoidance Assistance  

To the extent possible, controllers will issue pertinent  information on weather and assist pilots in avoiding such  areas when requested. Pilots should respond to a weather  advisory by either acknowledging the advisory or by  acknowledging the advisory and requesting an alternative  course of action as follows:  

•	 Request to deviate off course by stating the number  of miles and the direction of the requested deviation.   •	 Request a new route to avoid the affected area.   •	 Request a change of altitude.   •	 Request radar vectors around the affected areas.  

The controller’s primary function is to provide safe separation  between aircraft. Any additional service, such as weather  avoidance assistance, can only be provided to the extent  that it does not detract from the primary function. It’s also  worth noting that the separation workload is generally greater  than normal when weather disrupts the usual flow of traffic.  ATC radar limitations and frequency congestion may also  be a factor in limiting the controller’s capability to provide  additional service.  

# Electronic Flight Displays (EFD) /Multi- Function Display (MFD) Weather  

Many aircraft manufacturers now include data link weather  services with new electronic flight display (EFD) systems.  EFDs give a pilot access to many of the data link weather  services available.  

Products available to a pilot on the display pictured in  Figure 13-15  are listed as follows. The letters in parentheses  indicate the soft key to press in order to access the data.  

•	 Graphical NEXRAD data (NEXRAD) •	 Graphical METAR data (METAR) •	 Textual METAR data •	 Textual terminal aerodrome forecasts (TAF) •	 City forecast data •	 Graphical wind data (WIND) •	 Graphical echo tops (ECHO T,,,OPS)  

•	 Graphical cloud tops (CLD TOPS) •	 Graphical lightning strikes (LTNG) •	 Graphical storm cell movement (CELL MOV) •	 NEXRAD radar coverage (information displayed with  the NEXRAD data) •	 SIGMETs/AIRMETs (SIG/AIR) •	 Surface analysis to include city forecasts (SFC) •	 County warnings (COUNTY) •	 Freezing levels (FRZ LVL) •	 Hurricane track (CYCLONE) •	 Temporary flight restrictions (TFR)  

Pilots must be familiar with any EFD or MFD used and the  data link weather products available on the display.  

# Weather Products Age and Expiration  

The information displayed using a data link weather link is  near real time but should not be thought of as instantaneous,  up-to-date information. Each type of weather display is  stamped with the age information on the MFD. The time is  referenced from Zulu when the information was assembled at  the ground station. The age should not be assumed to be the  time when the FIS received the information from the data link.  

Two types of weather are displayed on the screen: “current”  weather and forecast data. Current information is displayed  by an age while the forecast data has a data stamp in the form  of “__ / __ __ : __.”  [Figure 13-16]  

# The Next Generation Weather Radar System  (NEXRAD)  

The NEXRAD system is comprised of a series of 159 Weather  Surveillance Radar–1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) sites situated  throughout the United States, as well as selected overseas  sites. The NEXRAD system is a joint venture between the  United States Department of Commerce (DOC), the United  States DOD, as well as the United States Department of  Transportation (DOT). The individual agencies that have  control over the system are the NWS, Air Force Weather  Agency (AFWA) and the FAA.  [Figure 13-17]  

NEXRAD data for up to a 2,000 mile range can be displayed.  It is important to realize that the radar image is not real time  and can be up to 5 minutes old. The NTSB has reported on 2  fatal accidents where in-cockpit NEXRAD mosaic imagery  was available to pilots operating near quickly-developing and  fast-moving convective weather. In one of these accidents,  the images were from 6 to 8 minutes old. In some cases,  NEXRAD data can age significantly by the time the mosaic  image is created. In some extreme latency cases, the actual  

![](images/20c1ab3a52be5cc46e1e1132c68c41ff7070c7dba1349c8ffcbb34364d44ef72.jpg)  
Figure 13-15.  Information page.  

age of the oldest NEXRAD data in the mosaic can exceed  the age indication in the cockpit by 15 to 20 minutes. Even  small-time differences between the age indicator and actual  conditions can be important for safety of flight, especially  when considering fast-moving weather hazards, quickly  developing weather scenarios, and/or fast-moving aircraft.  At no time should the images be used as storm penetrating  radar nor to navigate through a line of storms. The images  display should only be used as a reference.  

NEXRAD radar is mutually exclusive of Topographic  (TOPO), TERRAIN and STORMSCOPE. When NEXRAD  is turned on, TOPO, TERRAIN, and STORMSCOPE are  turned off because the colors used to display intensities are  very similar.  

Lightning information is available to assist when NEXRAD  is enabled. This presents a more comprehensive picture of  the weather in the surrounding area.  

In addition to utilizing the soft keys to activate the NEXRAD  display, the pilot also has the option of setting the desired  range. It is possible to zoom in on a specific area of the  display in order to gain a more detailed picture of the radar  display.  [Figure 13-18]  

# What Can Pilots Do?  

Remember that the in-cockpit NEXRAD display depicts  where the weather WAS, not where it IS. The age indicator  does not show the age of the actual weather conditions,  but rather the age of the mosaic image. The actual weather  conditions could be up to 15 to 20 minutes OLDER than  the age indicated on the display. You should consider this

potential delay when using in-cockpit NEXRAD capabilities,  as the movement and/or intensification of weather could  adversely affect safety of flight.  

•   	 Understand that the common perception of a “5-minute  latency” with radar data is not always correct. •   	 Get your preflight weather briefing! Having in-cockpit  weather capabilities does not circumvent the need for  a complete weather briefing before takeoff. •   	 Use all appropriate sources of weather information to  make in-flight decisions. •   	 Let your fellow pilots know about the limitations of  in-cockpit NEXRAD.  

# NEXRAD Abnormalities  

Although NEXRAD is a compilation of stations across  the country, there can be abnormalities associated with the  system. Some of the abnormalities are listed below.  

•	 Ground clutter •	 Strobes and spurious radar data •	 Sun strobes, when the radar antenna points directly at  the sun •	 Interference from buildings or mountains that may  cause shadows •	 Military aircraft that deploy metallic dust and may  reflect the radar signature  

# NEXRAD Limitations  

In addition to the abnormalities listed, the NEXRAD system  does have some specific limitations.  

# Base Reflectivity  

The NEXRAD base reflectivity does not provide adequate  information from which to determine cloud layers or type  of precipitation with respect to hail versus rain. Therefore, a  pilot may mistake rain for hail.  

In addition, the base reflectivity is sampled at the minimum  antenna elevation angle. With this minimum angle, an  individual site cannot depict high altitude storms directly  over the station. This leaves an area of null coverage if an  adjacent site does not also cover the affected area.  

# Resolution Display  

The resolution of the displayed data poses additional concerns  when the range is decreased. The minimum resolution for  NEXRAD returns is 1.24 miles. This means that when the  display range is zoomed in to approximately ten miles, the  individual square return boxes are more prevalent. Each  square indicates the strongest display return within that 1.24  mile square area.  

# AIRMET/SIGMET Display  

AIRMET/SIGMET information is available for the displayed  viewing range on the MFD. Some displays are capable of  displaying weather information for a 2,000 mile range.  AIRMETS/SIGMETS are displayed by dashed lines on the  map.  [Figure 13-19]  

The legend box denotes the various colors used to depict the  AIRMETs, such as icing, turbulence, IFR weather, mountain  obscuration, and surface winds.  [Figure 13-20]  The great  advantage of the graphically displayed AIRMET/SIGMET  boundary box is the pilot can see the extent of the area that  the advisory covers. The pilot does not need to manually plot  the points to determine the full extent of the coverage area.  

# Graphical METARs  

METARs can be displayed on the MFD. Each reporting  station that has a METAR/TAF available is depicted by a flag  from the center of the airport symbol. Each flag is color coded  to depict the type of weather that is currently reported at that  station. A legend is available to assist users in determining  what each flag color represents.  [Figure 13-21]  

The graphical METAR display shows all available reporting  stations within the set viewing range. By setting the range  knob up to a 2,000 mile range, pilots can pan around the  display map to check the current conditions of various  airports along the route of flight.  

By understanding what each colored flag indicates, a pilot can  quickly determine where weather patterns display marginal  weather, IFR, or areas of VFR. These flags make it easy to  determine weather at a specific airport should the need arise  to divert from the intended airport of landing.  

# Data Link Weather  

Pilots now have the capability of receiving continuously  updated weather across the entire country at any altitude.  No longer are pilots restricted by radio range or geographic  isolations, such as mountains or valleys.  

In addition, pilots no longer have to request specific  information from weather briefing personnel directly. When  the weather becomes questionable, radio congestion often  increases, delaying the timely exchange of valuable inflight  weather updates for a pilot’s specific route of flight. Flight  Service Station (FSS) personnel can communicate with only  one pilot at a time, which leaves other pilots waiting and  flying in uncertain weather conditions. Data link weather  

![](images/03c9f7f0eb536ea8a7c7731e1760ebc50e0cbf190cf1e61292156aaf97708dc5.jpg)  
Figure 13-19.  The AIRMET information box instructs the pilot to press the ENTER button soft key (ENT) to gain additional information  on the selected area of weather. Once the ENTER soft key (ENT) is depressed, the specific textual information is displayed on the right  side of the screen.

provides the pilot with a powerful resource for enhanced  situational awareness at any time. Due to continuous data link  broadcasts, pilots can obtain a weather briefing by looking at  a display screen. Pilots have a choice between FAA-certified  devices or portable receivers as a source of weather data.  

# Data Link Weather Products Flight Information Service- Broadcast (FIS-B)  

Flight Information Service–Broadcast (FIS-B) is a ground  broadcast service provided through the Automatic Dependent  Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) Services network over  the   $978\,\mathrm{MHz}$   UAT data link. The FAA FIS-B system  provides pilots and flight crews of properly-equipped aircraft  with a flightdeck display of certain aviation weather and  aeronautical information which are listed below.  

•	 Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) •	 Special Aviation Reports (SPECIs) •	 Terminal Area Forecasts (TAFs) and their amendments •	 NEXRAD (regional and CONUS) precipitation maps •	 Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) Distant and Flight Data  Center •	 Airmen’s Meteorological Conditions (AIRMET)  

•	 Significant Meteorological Conditions (SIGMET) and  Convective SIGMET •	 Status of Special Use Airspace (SUA) •	 Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs) •	 Winds and Temperatures Aloft. •	 Pilot Reports (PIREPS) •	 TIS-B service status  

The weather products provided by FIS-B are for information  only. Therefore, these products do not meet the safety and  regulatory requirements of official weather products. The  weather products displayed on FIS-B should not be used  as primary weather products (i.e., aviation weather to meet  operational and safety requirements). Each aircraft system is  different and some of the data that is rendered can be up to  20 or 30 minutes old and not current. Pilots should consult  the individual equipment manuals for specific delay times.  

# Pilot Responsibility  

It is important for pilots to understand the realization that the  derived safety benefits of data link depends heavily upon the  pilot’s understanding of the specific system’s capabilities and  limitations which are listed below.  

• 	 Product latency—be aware of the time stamp or “valid  until” time on the particular data link information  displayed in the flightdeck.  For example, since initial  processing and transmission of NEXRAD data can  take several minutes, pilots must assume that data  link weather information will always be a minimum  of seven to eight minutes older than shown on the time  stamp and only use data link weather radar images for  broad strategic avoidance of adverse weather. • 	 Product update cycles—be aware of when and how  often a product is updated as well as the Data Link  Service Providers (DLSP) update rate for particular  products. • 	 Indication of system failure—be aware of partial or  total system failure indications. • 	 Coverage areas/service volume—coverage limitations  are associated with the type of data link network  being used. For example, ground-based systems that  require a line-of-sight may have relatively limited  coverage below 5,000 feet AGL. Satellite-based data  link weather systems can have limitations stemming  from whether the network is in geosynchronous orbit  or low earth orbit. Also, NWS NEXRAD coverage  has gaps, especially in the western states. • 	 Content/format—since service providers often refine  or enhance data link products for flightdeck display,  pilots must be familiar with the content, format, and  meaning of symbols and displays (i.e., the legend) in  the specific system. • 	 Data integrity/limitations to use—reliability of  information depicted.  Be aware of any applicable  disclaimer provided by the service provider. • 	 Use of equipment/avionics display—pilots remain  responsible for the proper use of an electronic flight  bag (EFB) or installed avionics. Pilots should be  cognizant that, per the FAA Practical Test Standards,  they may be evaluated on the use and interpretation  of an EFB or installed avionics on the aircraft. • 	 Overload of Information—most DLSPs offer  numerous products with information that can be  layered on top of each other. Pilots need to be aware  that too much information can have a negative effect  on their cognitive work load. Pilots need to manage the  amount of information to a level that offers the most  pertinent information to that specific flight without  

creating a distraction. Pilots may need to adjust the  amount of information based on numerous factors  including, but not limited to, the phase of flight, single  pilot operation, autopilot availability, class of airspace,  and the weather conditions encountered.  

# Chapter Summary  

While no weather forecast is guaranteed to be 100 percent  accurate, pilots have access to a myriad of weather information  on which to base flight decisions. Weather products available  for preflight planning to en route information received over  the radio or via data link provide the pilot with the most  accurate and up-to-date information available. Each report  provides a piece of the weather puzzle. Pilots must use several  reports to get an overall picture and gain an understanding  of the weather that affects the safe completion of a flight.  

# Airport  Operations  

# Introduction  

Each time a pilot operates an aircraft, the flight normally  begins and ends at an airport. An airport may be a small sod  field or a large complex utilized by air carriers. This chapter  examines airport operations, identifies features of an airport  complex, and provides information on operating on or in the  vicinity of an airport.  

# Airport Categories  

The definition for airports refers to any area of land or water  used or intended for landing or takeoff of aircraft. This  includes, within the five categories of airports listed below,  special types of facilities including seaplane bases, heliports,  and facilities to accommodate tilt rotor aircraft. An airport  includes an area used or intended for airport buildings,  facilities, as well as rights of way together with the buildings  and facilities.  

![](images/d3af012af1f6fb0d23738670bdc1ef790c9217782c65da4141f5bf1d705397ad.jpg)  

The law defines airports by categories of airport activities,  including commercial service, primary, cargo service,  reliever, and general aviation airports, as shown below:  

•	 Commercial Service Airports—publicly owned airports that have at least 2,500 passenger boardings each calendar year and receive scheduled passenger service. Passenger boardings refer to revenue passenger  boardings on an aircraft in service in air commerce whether or not in scheduled service. The definition also includes passengers who continue on an aircraft in international flight that stops at an airport in any of the 50 States for a non-traffic purpose, such as refueling  or aircraft maintenance rather than passenger activity. Passenger boardings at airports that receive scheduled  passenger service are also referred to as Enplanements. •	 Cargo Service Airports—airports that, in addition to any other air transportation services that may be available,  are served by aircraft providing air transportation of only cargo with a total annual landed weight of more than 100 million pounds. “Landed weight” means the weight of aircraft transporting only cargo in intrastate,  interstate, and foreign air transportation. An airport may be both a commercial service and a cargo service airport. •	 Reliever Airports—airports designated by the FAA to relieve congestion at Commercial Service Airports and to provide improved general aviation access to the  overall community. These may be publicly or privately- owned. •	 General Aviation Airports — the remaining airports are commonly described as General Aviation Airports.  This airport type is the largest single group of airports in the U.S. system. The category also includes privately  owned, public use airports that enplane 2500 or more passengers annually and receive scheduled airline service.  

# Types of Airports  

There are two types of airports—towered and nontowered.  These types can be further subdivided to:  

•	 Civil Airports—airports that are open to the general public. •	 Military/Federal Government airports—airports operated by the military, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), or other agencies of the Federal Government. •	 Private Airports—airports designated for private or restricted use only, not open to the general public.  

# Towered Airport  

A towered airport has an operating control tower. Air traffic  control (ATC) is responsible for providing the safe, orderly,  and expeditious flow of air traffic at airports where the  type of operations and/or volume of traffic requires such a  service. Pilots operating from a towered airport are required  to maintain two-way radio communication with ATC and to  acknowledge and comply with their instructions. Pilots must  advise ATC if they cannot comply with the instructions issued  and request amended instructions. A pilot may deviate from  an air traffic instruction in an emergency, but must advise  ATC of the deviation as soon as possible.  

# Nontowered Airport  

A nontowered airport does not have an operating control  tower. Two-way radio communications are not required,  although it is a good operating practice for pilots to transmit  their intentions on the specified frequency for the benefit  of other traffic in the area. The key to communicating at an  airport without an operating control tower is selection of the  correct common frequency. The acronym CTAF, which stands  for Common Traffic Advisory Frequency, is synonymous  with this program. A CTAF is a frequency designated for  the purpose of carrying out airport advisory practices while  operating to or from an airport without an operating control  tower. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community  (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or  tower frequency and is identified in appropriate aeronautical  publications. UNICOM is a nongovernment air/ground radio  communication station that may provide airport information  at public use airports where there is no tower or FSS. On pilot  request, UNICOM stations may provide pilots with weather  information, wind direction, the recommended runway, or  other necessary information. If the UNICOM frequency  is designated as the CTAF, it is identified in appropriate  aeronautical publications.  Figure 14-1  lists recommended  communication procedures. More information regarding  radio communications is provided later in this chapter.  

Nontowered airport traffic patterns are always entered at  pattern altitude. How you enter the pattern depends upon the  direction of arrival. The preferred method for entering from  the downwind side of the pattern is to approach the pattern  on a course 45 degrees to the downwind leg and join the  pattern at midfield.  

There are several ways to enter the pattern if you’re coming  from the upwind leg side of the airport. One method of entry  from the opposite side of the pattern is to announce your  intentions and cross over midfield at least 500 feet above  

![Figure 14-1.   Recommended communication procedures. ](images/6efa619bcec717ef4c2e76b212d245b238ded5217fe9644e4d9ca4ebb879bd70.jpg)  

pattern altitude (normally 1,500 feet AGL.) However, if large or  turbine aircraft operate at your airport, it is best to remain 2,000  feet AGL so you are not in conflict with their traffic pattern.  When well clear of the pattern—approximately 2 miles–scan  carefully for traffic, descend to pattern altitude, then turn right  to enter at  $45^{\circ}$   to the downwind leg at midfield.  [Figure 14-2]  

An alternate method is to enter on a midfield crosswind at  pattern altitude, carefully scan for traffic, announce your  intentions, and then turn downwind.  [Figure 14-3]  This  technique should not be used if the pattern is busy. Always  remember to give way to aircraft on the preferred   $45^{\circ}$   entry  and to aircraft already established on downwind.  

In either case, it is vital to announce your intentions, and  remember to scan outside. Before joining the downwind  leg, adjust your course or speed to blend into the traffic.  Adjust power on the downwind leg, or sooner, to fit into  the flow of traffic. Avoid flying too fast or too slow. Speeds  recommended by the airplane manufacturer should be used.  They will generally fall between 70 to 80 knots for fixed-gear  singles and 80 to 90 knots for high-performance retractable.  

# Sources for Airport Data  

When a pilot flies into a different airport, it is important to  review the current data for that airport. This data provides the  pilot with information, such as communication frequencies,  services available, closed runways, or airport construction.  Three common sources of information are:  

•	 Aeronautical Charts •	 Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) •	 Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) •	 Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS)  

# Aeronautical Charts  

Aeronautical charts provide specific information on airports.  Chapter 16, “Navigation,” contains an excerpt from an  aeronautical chart and an aeronautical chart legend, which  provides guidance on interpreting the information on the chart.  

# Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility  Directory)  

The Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility  Directory) provides the most comprehensive information on  a given airport. It contains information on airports, heliports,  and seaplane bases that are open to the public. The Chart  Supplement U.S. is published in seven books, which are  organized by regions and are revised every 56 days. The  Chart Supplement U.S. is also available digitally at www.faa.  

![](images/30c1e52c38a9fd810373dc36538169ba293e12db27c7311181248e60b7985834.jpg)

gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav.  Figure 14-4  contains an  excerpt from a directory. For a complete listing of information  provided in a Chart Supplement U.S. and how the information  may be decoded, refer to the “Legend Sample” located in the  front of each Chart Supplement U.S.  

In addition to airport information, each Chart Supplement  U.S. contains information such as special notices, Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Weather  Service (NWS) telephone numbers, preferred instrument  flight rules (IFR) routing, visual flight rules (VFR) waypoints,  a listing of very high frequency (VHF) omnidirectional range  (VOR) receiver checkpoints, aeronautical chart bulletins, land  and hold short operations (LAHSO) for selected airports,  airport diagrams for selected towered airports, en route  flight advisory service (EFAS) outlets, parachute jumping  areas, and facility telephone numbers. It is beneficial to  review a Chart Supplement U.S. to become familiar with the  information it contains.  

# Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)  

Time-critical aeronautical information, which is of a temporary  nature or not sufficiently known in advance to permit  publication, on aeronautical charts or in other operational  

![](images/307325395e6a76b446cf598fe64fd82c3ef6f011373e986653ed645e1435f6e8.jpg)

publications receives immediate dissemination by the  NOTAM system. The NOTAM information could affect your  decision to make the flight. It includes such information as  taxiway and runway closures, construction, communications,  changes in status of navigational aids, and other information  essential to planned en route, terminal, or landing operations.  Exercise good judgment and common sense by carefully  regarding the information readily available in NOTAMs.  

Prior to any flight, pilots should check for any NOTAMs that  could affect their intended flight. For more information on  NOTAMs, refer back to Chapter 1, “Pilot and Aeronautical  Information” section.  

# Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS)  

The Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) is a  recording of the local weather conditions and other pertinent  non-control information broadcast on a local frequency in a  looped format. It is normally updated once per hour but is  updated more often when changing local conditions warrant.  Important information is broadcast on ATIS including  weather, runways in use, specific ATC procedures, and any  airport construction activity that could affect taxi planning.  

When the ATIS is recorded, it is given a code. This code is  changed with every ATIS update. For example, ATIS Alpha  is replaced by ATIS Bravo. The next hour, ATIS Charlie is  recorded, followed by ATIS Delta and progresses down the  alphabet.  

Prior to calling ATC, tune to the ATIS frequency and listen to  the recorded broadcast. The broadcast ends with a statement  containing the ATIS code. For example, “Advise on initial  contact, you have information Bravo.” Upon contacting the  tower controller, state information Bravo was received. This  allows the tower controller to verify the pilot has the current  local weather and airport information without having to  state it all to each pilot who calls. This also clears the tower  frequency from being overtaken by the constant relay of  the same information, which would result without an ATIS  broadcast. The use of ATIS broadcasts at departure and arrival  airports is not only a sound practice but a wise decision.  

# Airport Markings and Signs  

There are markings and signs used at airports that provide  directions and assist pilots in airport operations. It is important  for you to know the meanings of the signs, markings, and lights  that are used on airports as surface navigational aids. All airport  markings are painted on the surface, whereas some signs are  vertical and some are painted on the surface. An overview of the  most common signs and markings are described on the following  pages. Additional information may be found in Chapter 2,  “Aeronautical Lighting and Other Airport Visual Aids,” of  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

# Runway Markings and Signs  

Runway markings vary depending on the type of operations  conducted at the airport. A basic VFR runway may only  have centerline markings and runway numbers. Refer to  Appendix C of this publication for an example of the most  common runway markings that are found at airports.  

Since aircraft are affected by the wind during takeoffs and  landings, runways are laid out according to the local prevailing  winds. Runway numbers are in reference to magnetic north.  Certain airports have two or even three runways laid out in the  same direction. These are referred to as parallel runways and  are distinguished by a letter added to the runway number (e.g.,  runway 36L (left), 36C (center), and 36R (right)).  

# Relocated Runway Threshold  

It is sometimes necessary, due to construction or runway  maintenance, to close only a portion of a runway. When  a portion of a runway is closed, the runway threshold is  relocated as necessary. It is referred to as a relocated threshold  and methods for identifying the relocated threshold vary. A  common way for the relocated threshold to be marked is  a ten foot wide white bar across the width of the runway.  [Figure 14-5A  and  B]  

When the threshold is relocated, the closed portion of the  runway is not available for use by aircraft for takeoff or  landing, but it is available for taxi. When a threshold is  relocated, it closes not only a set portion of the approach  end of a runway, but also shortens the length of the opposite  direction runway. Yellow arrow heads are placed across the  width of the runway just prior to the threshold bar.  

# Displaced Threshold  

A displaced threshold is a threshold located at a point on  the runway other than the designated beginning of the  runway. Displacement of a threshold reduces the length  of runway available for landings. The portion of runway  behind a displaced threshold is available for takeoffs in either  direction, or landings from the opposite direction. A ten feet  wide white threshold bar is located across the width of the  runway at the displaced threshold, and white arrows are  located along the centerline in the area between the beginning  of the runway and displaced threshold. White arrow heads  are located across the width of the runway just prior to the  threshold bar.  [Figure 14-6A  and  $B J$  

![](images/4781f788282d4e92dcbf98ba2be1bd65add6afc269824c968bda392f65f94632.jpg)  
Figure 14-5.  (A) Relocated runway threshold drawing. (B) Relocated threshold for Runway 36 at Joplin Regional Airport (JLN).  

# Runway Safety Area  

The runway safety area (RSA) is a defined surface  surrounding the runway prepared, or suitable, for reducing  the risk of damage to airplanes in the event of an undershoot,  overshoot, or excursion from the runway. The dimensions  of the RSA vary and can be determined by using the  criteria contained within AC 150/5300-13, Airport Design,  Chapter 3. Figure 3-1 in AC 150/5300-13 depicts the RSA.  Additionally, it provides greater accessibility for firefighting  and rescue equipment in emergency situations.  

The RSA is typically graded and mowed. The lateral  boundaries are usually identified by the presence of the  runway holding position signs and markings on the adjoining  taxiway stubs. Aircraft should not enter the RSA without  making sure of adequate separation from other aircraft during  operations at uncontrolled airports.  [Figure 14-7]  

# Runway Safety Area Boundary Sign  

Some taxiway stubs also have a runway safety area boundary  sign that faces the runway and is visible to you only when  exiting the runway. This sign has a yellow background with  black markings and is typically used at towered airports  where a controller commonly requests you to report clear of  a runway. This sign is intended to provide you with another  visual cue that is used as a guide to determine when you are  clear of the runway safety boundary area. The sign shown in  Figure 14-8  is what you would see when exiting the runway at  Taxiway Kilo. You are out of the runway safety area boundary  when the entire aircraft passes the sign and the accompanying  surface painted marking.  

# Runway Holding Position Sign  

Noncompliance with a runway holding position sign may  result in the FAA filing a Pilot Deviation against you. A  

![](images/4912c3fb5d9da3145dfd51a947b4044bf750d340846d393c91a0bf84d948f0f9.jpg)  
Figure 14-6.  (A) Displaced runway threshold drawing. (B) Displaced threshold for Runway 17 at Albuquerque International Airport   $(A B Q)$  .  

runway holding position sign is an airport version of a  stop sign.  [Figure 14-9]  It may be seen as a sign and/or its  characters painted on the airport pavement. The sign has  white characters outlined in black on a red background. It is  always collocated with the surface painted holding position  markings and is located where taxiways intersect runways.  On taxiways that intersect the threshold of the takeoff runway,  only the designation of the runway may appear on the sign.  

If a taxiway intersects a runway somewhere other than at  the threshold, the sign has the designation of the intersecting  runway. The runway numbers on the sign are arranged to  correspond to the relative location of the respective runway  thresholds.  Figure 14-10  shows   $^{\circ}18–36^{\circ}$   to indicate the  threshold for Runway 18 is to the left and the threshold for  

![](images/7acbe615769879e64a3d069a9c736efd27a32636c1204462e2d112a8375d50b6.jpg)

Figure 14-10.  Runway holding position sign at a location other  than the takeoff end of Runway 18-36 with collocated Taxiway  Alpha location sign.  

Runway 36 is to the right. The sign also indicates that you  are located on Taxiway Alpha.  

If the runway holding position sign is located on a taxiway  at the intersection of two runways, the designations for  both runways are shown on the sign along with arrows  showing the approximate alignment of each runway.  [Figure 14-11A  and    $B J$   In addition to showing the  approximate runway alignment, the arrows indicate the  direction(s) to the threshold of the runway whose designation  is immediately next to each corresponding arrow.  

This type of taxiway and runway/runway intersection  geometry can be very confusing and create navigational  challenges. Extreme caution must be exercised when taxiing  onto or crossing this type of intersection.  Figure 14-11A  and   $B$   shows a depiction of a taxiway, runway/runway intersection  and is also designated as a “ hot spot ” on the airport diagram.  In the example, Taxiway Bravo intersects with two runways,  31-13 and 35-17, which cross each other.  

Surface painted runway holding position signs may also be  used to aid you in determining the holding position. These  markings consist of white characters on a red background  and are painted on the left side of the taxiway centerline.  Figure 14-12  shows a surface painted runway holding  position sign that is the holding point for Runway 32R-14L.  

You should never allow any part of your aircraft to cross the  runway holding position sign (either a vertical or surface  painted sign) without a clearance from ATC. Doing so poses  a hazard to yourself and others.  

When the tower is closed or you are operating at a nontowered  airport, you may taxi past a runway holding position sign only  when the runway is clear of aircraft, and there are no aircraft on  final approach. You may then proceed with extreme caution.  

# Runway Holding Position Marking  

Noncompliance with a runway holding position marking  may result in the FAA filing a Pilot Deviation against you. Runway holding position markings consist of four yellow  lines, two solid and two dashed, that are painted on the surface  and extend across the width of the taxiway to indicate where  the aircraft should stop when approaching a runway. These  markings are painted across the entire taxiway pavement, are  in alignment, and are collocated with the holding position  sign as described above.  

As you approach the runway, two solid yellow lines and two  dashed lines will be visible. Prior to reaching the solid lines, it  is imperative to stop and ensure that no portion of the aircraft  intersects the first solid yellow line. Do not cross the double  solid lines until a clearance from ATC has been received.  [Figure 14-13]  When the tower is closed or when operating at  a nontowered airport, you may taxi onto or across the runway  only when the runway is clear and there are no aircraft on final  approach. You should use extreme caution when crossing or  taxiing onto the runway and always look both ways.  

When exiting the runway, the same markings will be seen  except the aircraft will be approaching the double dashed  lines.  [Figure 14-14]  In order to be clear of the runway, the  entire aircraft must cross both the dashed and solid lines.  An ATC clearance is not needed to cross this marking when  exiting the runway.  

# Runway Distance Remaining Signs  

Runway distance remaining signs have a black background  with a white number and may be installed along one or both  sides of the runway.  [Figure 14-15]  The number on the  signs indicates the distance, in thousands of feet, of landing  runway remaining. The last sign, which has the numeral “1,”  is located at least 950 feet from the runway end.  

# Runway Designation Marking  

Runway numbers and letters are determined from the  approach direction. The runway number is the whole number  nearest one-tenth the magnetic azimuth of the centerline of the  runway, measured clockwise from the magnetic north. In the  case where there are parallel runways, the letters differentiate  between left (L), right (R), or center (C).  [Figure 14-16]  For  example, if there are two parallel runways, they would show  the designation number and then either L or R beneath it.  For three parallel runways, the designation number would  be presented with L, C, or R beneath it.  

![](images/e1ee7769b883984d44dfe1df903ea4e49843a483ac930830b185b25856c2663f.jpg)

# Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)  

When simultaneous operations (takeoffs and landings) are  being conducted on intersecting runways, Land and Hold  Short Operations (LAHSO) may also be in effect. LAHSO  is an ATC procedure that may require your participation and  

![](images/8c1c49fffbc626cb6fb9ca9f669fc8beb98eb05bc0cb8e0bd6b477b44a03089e.jpg)  
Figure 14-15.  Runway distance remaining sign indicating that there  is 2,000 feet of runway remaining.  

compliance. As pilot in command (PIC), you have the final  authority to accept or decline any LAHSO clearance.  

If issued a land and hold short clearance, you must be aware  of the reduced runway distances and whether or not you can  comply before accepting the clearance. You do not have  to accept a LAHSO clearance. Pilots should only receive a  LAHSO clearance when there is a minimum ceiling of 1,000  feet and 3 statute miles of visibility.  

Runway holding position signs and markings are installed  on those runways used for LAHSO. The signs and markings  are placed at the LAHSO point to aid you in determining  where to stop and hold the aircraft and are located prior to  the runway/runway intersection.  [Figure 14-17]  

The holding position sign has a white inscription with black  border around the numbers on a red background and is installed  adjacent to the holding position markings. If you accept a land  and hold short clearance, you must comply so that no portion  of the aircraft extends beyond these hold markings.  

If receiving “cleared to land” instructions from ATC, you  are authorized to use the entire landing length of the runway  and should disregard any LAHSO holding position markings  located on the runway. If you receive and accept LAHSO  instructions, you must stop short of the intersecting runway  prior to the LAHSO signs and markings.  

Below is a list of items which, if thoroughly understood  and complied with, will ensure that LAHSO operations are  conducted properly.  

•	 Know landing distance available. •	 Be advised by ATC as to why LAHSO are being  conducted.  

![](images/60c71cf52cb216ef0bf2334d8d4dc535366540ee007850bb00980f30cd3691b4.jpg)  
Figure 14-16.  Two of three parallel runways.  

•	 Advise ATC if you cannot comply with LAHSO.

 •	 Know what signs and markings are at the LAHSO point.

 •	 LAHSO are not authorized for student pilots who are performing a solo flight.

 •	 At many airports air carrier aircraft are not authorized  to participate in LAHSO if the other aircraft is a general aviation aircraft.

 •	 Generally, LAHSO are not authorized at night.

 •	 LAHSO are not authorized on wet runways.

Figure 14-17.  Runway holding position sign and marking for LAHSO.  

If you accept the following clearance from ATC: “Cleared to  land Runway 36 hold short of Runway 23,” you must either exit  Runway 36 or stop at the holding position prior to Runway 23.  

# Taxiway Markings and Signs  

Taxiway direction signs have a yellow background and  black characters, which identifies the designation or  intersecting taxiways. Arrows indicate the direction of turn  that would place the aircraft on the designated taxiway.  [Figure 14-18]  Direction signs are normally located on  the left side of the taxiway and prior to the intersection.  These signs and markings (with a yellow background and  black characters) indicate the direction toward a different  taxiway, leading off a runway, or out of an intersection.  Figure 14-18  shows Taxiway Delta and how Taxiway Bravo  intersects ahead at  $90°$   both left and right.  

Taxiway direction signs can also be displayed as surface  painted markings.  Figure 14-19  shows Taxiway Bravo as  proceeding straight ahead while Taxiway Alpha turns to the  right at approximately  $45^{\circ}$  .  

![](images/cf571e1e0fff0f109725de750b232f72d0af0eaee74a4eb87a20d9bff435c7fb.jpg)  
Figure 14-18.  Taxiway Bravo direction sign with a collocated  Taxiway Delta location sign. When the arrow on the direction  sign indicates a turn, the sign is located prior to the intersection.  

Figure 14-20A  and  $B$    shows an example of a direction sign at  a complex taxiway intersection.  Figure  $_{I4-20A}$    and  $B$   shows  Taxiway Bravo intersects with Taxiway Sierra at  $90^{\circ}$  , but at   $45^{\circ}$   with Taxiway Foxtrot. This type of array can be displayed  with or without the taxiway location sign, which in this case  would be Taxiway Bravo.  

# Enhanced Taxiway Centerline Markings  

At most towered airports, the enhanced taxiway centerline  marking is used to warn you of an upcoming runway. It consists  of yellow dashed lines on either side of the normal solid taxiway  centerline and the dashes extend up to 150 feet prior to a  runway holding position marking.  [Figure 14-21A  and  $B J$    They  are used to aid you in maintaining awareness during surface  movement to reduce runway incursions.  

# Destination Signs  

Destination signs have black characters on a yellow  background indicating a destination at the airport. These  

![](images/0f1c96ea7f570fdbd7afcefd558f4da2349edf0a46efdf1bdb796f40f8a0f42e.jpg)  
Figure 14-19.  Surface painted taxiway direction signs.  

signs always have an arrow showing the direction of the taxi  route to that destination.  [Figure 14-22]  When the arrow on  the destination sign indicates a turn, the sign is located prior  to the intersection. Destinations commonly shown on these  types of signs include runways, aprons, terminals, military  areas, civil aviation areas, cargo areas, international areas,  and fixed-base operators. When the inscription for two or  more destinations having a common taxi route are placed  on a sign, the destinations are separated by a “dot” (•) and  one arrow would be used as shown in  Figure 14-22.  When  the inscription on a sign contains two or more destinations  having different taxi routes, each destination is accompanied  by an arrow and separated from the other destination(s) on  the sign with a vertical black message divider as shown in  Figure 14-23.  The example shown in  Figure 14-23  shows  two signs. The sign in the foreground explains that Runway  20 threshold is to the left, and Runways 32, 2, and 14 are to  the right. The sign in the background indicates that you are  located on Taxiway Bravo and Taxiway November will take  you to those runways.  

# Holding Position Signs and Markings for an  Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Area  

The instrument landing system (ILS) broadcasts signals to  arriving instrument aircraft to guide them to the runway. Each  of these ILSs have critical areas that must be kept clear of all  obstacles in order to ensure quality of the broadcast signal. At  many airports, taxiways extend into the ILS critical area. Most  of the time, this is of no concern; however, during times of  poor weather, an aircraft on approach may depend on a good  signal quality. When necessary, ATC will protect the ILS  critical area for arrival instrument traffic by instructing taxiing  aircraft to “ hold short ” of Runway (XX) ILS critical area.  

The ILS critical area hold sign has white characters, outlined  in black, on a red background and is installed adjacent to the  ILS holding position markings.  [Figure 14-24]  The holding  position markings for the ILS critical area appear on the  pavement as a horizontal yellow ladder extending across the  width of the taxiway.  

When instructed to “hold short of Runway (XX) ILS critical  area,” you must ensure no portion of the aircraft extends  beyond these markings.  [Figure 14-25]  If ATC does not  instruct you to hold at this point, then you may bypass the ILS  critical area hold position markings and continue with your  taxi.  Figure 14-24  shows that the ILS hold sign is located  on Taxiway Golf and the ILS ladder hold position marking  is adjacent to the hold sign.

# Holding Position Markings for Taxiway/Taxiway  Intersections  

Holding position markings for taxiway/taxiway intersections  consist of a single dashed yellow line extending across the  width of the taxiway.  [Figure 14-26]  They are painted on  taxiways where ATC normally holds aircraft short of a  taxiway intersection. When instructed by ATC “hold short  of Taxiway X,” you should stop so that no part of your  aircraft extends beyond the holding position marking. When  the marking is not present, you should stop your aircraft at  a point that provides adequate clearance from an aircraft on  the intersecting taxiway.  

# Marking and Lighting of Permanently Closed  Runways and Taxiways  

For runways and taxiways that are permanently closed, the  lighting circuits are disconnected. The runway threshold,  runway designation, and touchdown markings are obliterated  and yellow “Xs” are placed at each end of the runway and  at 1,000-foot intervals.  

![](images/2141047ad0e45be879d1db7fea3ab2229df57683a4ae2e9e7e73a74d17856c23.jpg)  
Figure 14-26.  Holding position marking on a taxiway.  

# Temporarily Closed Runways and Taxiways  

For temporarily closed runways and taxiways, a visual  indication is often provided with yellow “Xs” or raised  lighted yellow “Xs” placed at each end of the runway.  Depending on the reason for the closure, duration of closure,  airfield configuration, and the existence and the hours of  operation of an ATC tower, a visual indication may not be  present. As discussed previously in the chapter, you must  always check NOTAMs and ATIS for runway and taxiway  closure information.  

Figure 14-27A  shows an example of a yellow “X” laid flat  with an adequate number of heavy sand bags to keep the  wind from getting under and displacing the vinyl material.  

A very effective and preferable visual aid to depict temporary  closure is the lighted “X” placed on or near the runway  designation numbers.  [Figure  $_{I4-27B}$    and  $C J$    This device is  much more discernible to approaching aircraft than the other  materials described above.  

# Other Markings  

Some other markings found on the airport include vehicle  roadway markings, VOR receiver checkpoint markings, and  non-movement area boundary markings.  

# Airport Signs  

There are six types of signs that may be found at airports. The  more complex the layout of an airport, the more important  the signs become to pilots. Appendix C of this publication  shows examples of some signs that are found at most airports,  their purpose, and appropriate pilot action. The six types of  signs are:  

•	 Mandatory instruction signs—red background with white inscription. These signs denote an entrance to a runway, critical area, or prohibited area.  

![](images/eb4e9480b39d84ae2335d092e350992e14b562becdaa1336edabe1852ec3d8e0.jpg)  
Figure 14-27.  (A) Yellow “X” placed on surface of temporarily closed  runways. (B) Lighted “X” placed on temporarily closed runways.  (C) Lighted “X” at night showing a temporarily closed runway.  

•	 Location signs—black with yellow inscription and a yellow border, no arrows. They are used to identify a taxiway or runway location, to identify the boundary of the runway, or identify an instrument landing system (ILS) critical area.  

•	 Direction signs—yellow background with black inscription. The inscription identifies the designation of the intersecting taxiway(s) leading out of an intersection. •	 Destination signs—yellow background with black inscription and arrows. These signs provide information on locating areas, such as runways, terminals, cargo areas, and civil aviation areas. •	 Information signs—yellow background with black inscription. These signs are used to provide the pilot with information on areas that cannot be seen from the  control tower, applicable radio frequencies, and noise  abatement procedures. The airport operator determines  the need, size, and location of these signs. •	 Runway distance remaining signs—black background  with white numbers. The numbers indicate the distance of the remaining runway in thousands of feet.  

# Airport Lighting  

The majority of airports have some type of lighting for night  operations. The variety and type of lighting systems depends  on the volume and complexity of operations at a given airport.  Airport lighting is standardized so that airports use the same  light colors for runways and taxiways.  

# Airport Beacon  

Airport beacons help a pilot identify an airport at night.  The beacons are normally operated from dusk until dawn.  Sometimes they are turned on if the ceiling is less than 1,000  feet and/or the ground visibility is less than 3 statute miles (VFR  minimums). However, there is no requirement for this, so a  pilot has the responsibility of determining if the weather meets  VFR requirements. The beacon has a vertical light distribution  to make it most effective from   $1{-}10^{\circ}$   above the horizon,  although it can be seen well above or below this spread. The  beacon may be an omnidirectional capacitor-discharge device,  or it may rotate at a constant speed, that produces the visual  effect of flashes at regular intervals. The combination of light  colors from an airport beacon indicates the type of airport.  [Figure 14-28]  Some of the most common beacons are:  

•	 Flashing white and green for civilian land airports •	 Flashing white and yellow for a water airport •	 Flashing white, yellow, and green for a heliport •	 Two quick white flashes alternating with a green flash identifying a military airport  

# Approach Light Systems  

Approach light systems are primarily intended to provide a  means to transition from instrument flight to visual flight for  landing. The system configuration depends on whether the  

![](images/87f5b52e9c37f26155dff2cbf4b79eabf2797982f0667b744565375887a6d47b.jpg)  
Figure 14-28.  Airport rotating beacons.  

runway is a precision or nonprecision instrument runway.  Some systems include sequenced flashing lights that appear  to the pilot as a ball of light traveling toward the runway at  high speed. Approach lights can also aid pilots operating  under VFR at night.  

# Visual Glideslope Indicators  

Visual glideslope indicators provide the pilot with glidepath  information that can be used for day or night approaches. By  maintaining the proper glidepath as provided by the system,  a pilot should have adequate obstacle clearance and should  touch down within a specified portion of the runway.  

# Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI)  

VASI installations are the most common visual glidepath  systems in use. The VASI provides obstruction clearance  within   $10^{\circ}$   of the extended runway centerline and up to four  nautical miles (NM) from the runway threshold.  

The VASI consists of light units arranged in bars. There are  2-bar and 3-bar VASIs. The 2-bar VASI has near and far light  bars and the 3-bar VASI has near, middle, and far light bars. Two-bar VASI installations provide one visual glidepath that is normally set at   $3^{\circ}$  . The 3-bar system provides two glidepaths, the lower glidepath normally set at   $3^{\circ}$   and the upper glidepath  $\%$   degree above the lower glidepath.  

The basic principle of the VASI is that of color differentiation  between red and white. Each light unit projects a beam of  light, a white segment in the upper part of the beam and a  red segment in the lower part of the beam. The lights are  arranged so the pilot sees the combination of lights shown in  Figure 14-29  to indicate below, on, or above the glidepath.  

# Other Glidepath Systems  

A precision approach path indicator (PAPI) uses lights similar  to the VASI system, except they are installed in a single row,  normally on the left side of the runway.  [Figure 14-30]  

![](images/cc6f90c22139406f7e9f0450bc8416e1245eea21465b49847f48d05d16cd6d0c.jpg)  
Figure 14-29.  Two-bar VASI system.  

A tri-color system consists of a single-light unit projecting  a three-color visual approach path. Below the glidepath is  indicated by red, on the glidepath is indicated by green, and  above the glidepath is indicated by amber. When descending  below the glidepath, there is a small area of dark amber. Pilots  should not mistake this area for an “above the glidepath”  indication.  [Figure 14-31]  

Pulsating VASIs normally consist of a single-light unit  projecting a two-color visual approach path into the final  approach area of the runway upon which the indicator is  installed. The “on glidepath” indication is a steady white  light. The “slightly below glidepath” indication is a steady red  light. If the aircraft descends further below the glidepath, the  red light starts to pulsate. The “above glidepath” indication  is a pulsating white light. The pulsating rate increases as the  aircraft gets further above or below the desired glideslope.  The useful range of the system is about four miles during the  day and up to ten miles at night.  [Figure 14-32]  

# Runway Lighting  

There are various lights that identify parts of the runway  complex. These assist a pilot in safely making a takeoff or  landing during night operations.  

# Runway End Identifier Lights (REIL)  

Runway end identifier lights (REIL) are installed at many  airfields to provide rapid and positive identification of the  approach end of a particular runway. The system consists  of a pair of synchronized flashing lights located laterally  on each side of the runway threshold. REILs may be either  omnidirectional or unidirectional facing the approach area.  

# Runway Edge Lights  

Runway edge lights are used to outline the edges of  runways at night or during low visibility conditions.  [Figure 14-33]  These lights are classified according to the  intensity they are capable of producing: high intensity runway  lights (HIRL), medium intensity runway lights (MIRL), and  

![](images/de851da037b17227e558ddc3ebcc6384a5dba3df49576a7697f192f710098565.jpg)

Figure 14-32.  Pulsating visual approach slope indicator.  

low intensity runway lights (LIRL). The HIRL and MIRL  have variable intensity settings. These lights are white, except  on instrument runways where amber lights are used on the  last 2,000 feet or half the length of the runway, whichever  is less. The lights marking the end of the runway are red.  

# In-Runway Lighting  

Runway centerline lighting system (RCLS)—installed on some  precision approach runways to facilitate landing under adverse  visibility conditions. They are located along the runway  centerline and are spaced at 50-foot intervals. When viewed  from the landing threshold, the runway centerline lights are  white until the last 3,000 feet of the runway. The white lights  begin to alternate with red for the next 2,000 feet. For the  remaining 1,000 feet of the runway, all centerline lights are red.  

Touchdown zone lights (TDZL)—installed on some precision  approach runways to indicate the touchdown zone when  landing under adverse visibility conditions. They consist of  two rows of transverse light bars disposed symmetrically  about the runway centerline. The system consists of steady- burning white lights that start 100 feet beyond the landing  threshold and extend to 3,000 feet beyond the landing  threshold or to the midpoint of the runway, whichever is less.  

![](images/7f3eba85ccf65818f401aa6d633b7ba4ac11d6fb4d3b08da256820c657c073fb.jpg)  
Figure 14-33.  Runway lights.  

Taxiway centerline lead-off lights—provide visual guidance  to persons exiting the runway. They are color-coded to warn  pilots and vehicle drivers that they are within the runway  environment or ILS critical area, whichever is more restrictive.  Alternate green and yellow lights are installed, beginning  with green, from the runway centerline to one centerline light  position beyond the runway holding position or ILS critical  area holding position.  

Taxiway centerline lead-on lights—provide visual guidance  to persons entering the runway. These “lead-on” lights are  also color-coded with the same color pattern as lead-off  lights to warn pilots and vehicle drivers that they are within  the runway environment or ILS critical area, whichever is  more conservative. The fixtures used for lead-on lights are  bidirectional (i.e., one side emits light for the lead-on function  while the other side emits light for the lead-off function). Any  fixture that emits yellow light for the lead-off function also  emits yellow light for the lead-on function.  

Land and hold short lights—used to indicate the hold short  point on certain runways which are approved for LAHSO.  Land and hold short lights consist of a row of pulsing white  lights installed across the runway at the hold short point.  Where installed, the lights are on anytime LAHSO is in effect.  These lights are off when LAHSO is not in effect.  

# Control of Airport Lighting  

Airport lighting is controlled by ATC at towered airports. At  nontowered airports, the lights may be on a timer, or where an  FSS is located at an airport, the FSS personnel may control the  lighting. A pilot may request various light systems be turned  on or off and also request a specified intensity, if available,  from ATC or FSS personnel. At selected nontowered airports,  the pilot may control the lighting by using the radio. This  is done by selecting a specified frequency and clicking the  radio microphone.  [Figure 14-34]  For information on pilot  controlled lighting at various airports, refer to the Chart  Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory).  

![Figure 14-34.  Radio controlled runway lighting. ](images/78b33430d889761983451a57224ca42adf18e0e9641fa88f106191cf4e908404.jpg)  

# Taxiway Lights  

Similar to runway lighting, taxiways also have various lights  which help pilots identify areas of the taxiway and any  surrounding runways.  

# Omnidirectional  

Omnidirectional taxiway lights outline the edges of the  taxiway and are blue in color. At many airports, these  edge lights may have variable intensity settings that may  be adjusted by an ATC when deemed necessary or when  requested by the pilot. Some airports also have taxiway  centerline lights that are green in color.  

# Clearance Bar Lights  

Clearance bar lights are installed at holding positions on  taxiways in order to increase the conspicuity of the holding  position in low visibility conditions. They may also be  installed to indicate the location of an intersecting taxiway  during periods of darkness. Clearance bars consist of three  in-pavement steady-burning yellow lights.  

# Runway Guard Lights  

Runway guard lights are installed at taxiway/runway  intersections. They are primarily used to enhance the  conspicuity of taxiway/runway intersections during low  visibility conditions, but may be used in all weather conditions.  Runway guard lights consist of either a pair of elevated flashing  yellow lights installed on either side of the taxiway, or a row of  in-pavement yellow lights installed across the entire taxiway,  at the runway holding position marking.  

Note: Some airports may have a row of three or five  in-pavement yellow lights installed at taxiway/runway  intersections. They should not be confused with clearance  bar lights described previously in this section.  

# Stop Bar Lights  

Stop bar lights, when installed, are used to confirm the ATC  clearance to enter or cross the active runway in low visibility  conditions (below 1,200 ft Runway Visual Range (RVR)).  A stop bar consists of a row of red, unidirectional, steady- burning in-pavement lights installed across the entire taxiway  at the runway holding position, and elevated steady-burning  red lights on each side. A controlled stop bar is operated in  conjunction with the taxiway centerline lead-on lights which  extend from the stop bar toward the runway. Following the  ATC clearance to proceed, the stop bar is turned off and the  lead-on lights are turned on. The stop bar and lead-on lights  are automatically reset by a sensor or backup timer.  

# Obstruction Lights  

Obstructions are marked or lighted to warn pilots of  their presence during daytime and nighttime conditions.  Obstruction lighting can be found both on and off an airport  to identify obstructions. They may be marked or lighted in  any of the following conditions.  

•	 Red obstruction lights—flash or emit a steady red color during nighttime operations, and the obstructions are painted orange and white for daytime operations. •	 High intensity white obstruction lights—flash high intensity white lights during the daytime with the intensity reduced for nighttime. •	 Dual lighting—a combination of flashing red beacons and steady red lights for nighttime operation and high intensity white lights for daytime operations.  

# New Lighting Technologies  

A top priority of the FAA is to continue to enhance airport  safety while maintaining airport capacity. Reducing runway  incursions is a major component of this effort. Runway  incursions develop quickly and without warning during routine  traffic situations on the airport surface, leaving little time for  corrective action. The Runway Status Lights (RWSL) System  is designed to provide a direct indication to you that it is unsafe  to enter a runway, cross a runway, or takeoff from or land on  a runway when the system is activated.  

Runway status lights are red in color and indicate runway  status only; they do not indicate clearance to enter a runway  or clearance to takeoff. The RWSL system provides warning  lights on runways and taxiways, illuminating when it is unsafe  to enter, cross, or begin takeoff on a runway. Currently, there  are two types: Runway Entrance Lights (REL) and Takeoff  Hold Lights (THL).  [Figures 14-35  and  14-36]  

REL provide a warning to aircraft crossing or entering a  runway from intersecting taxiways that there is conflicting  traffic on the runway. THL provide a warning signal to  aircraft in position for takeoff that the runway is occupied  and it is unsafe to take off. As of 2016, the RWSL system is  operational at 14 of the nation’s busiest airports with 3 more  airports scheduled to receive the system by 2017.

Figure 14-36.  Takeoff Hold Lights (THL).  

# Wind Direction Indicators  

It is important for a pilot to know the direction of the wind. At  facilities with an operating control tower, this information is  provided by ATC. Information may also be provided by FSS  personnel either located at a particular airport or remotely  available through a remote communication outlet (RCO), or  by requesting information on a CTAF at airports that have the  capacity to receive and broadcast on this frequency.  

When none of these services is available, it is possible  to determine wind direction and runway in use by visual  wind indicators. A pilot should check these wind indicators  even when information is provided on the CTAF at a given  airport because there is no assurance that the information  provided is accurate.  

The wind direction indicator can be a wind cone, wind sock,  tetrahedron, or wind tee. These are usually located in a central  location near the runway and may be placed in the center  of a segmented circle, which identifies the traffic pattern  direction if it is other than the standard left-hand pattern.  [Figures 14-37  and  14-38]  

The wind sock is a good source of information since it not  only indicates wind direction but allows the pilot to estimate  the wind velocity and/or gust factor. The wind sock extends  out straighter in strong winds and tends to move back and  forth when the wind is gusting. Wind tees and tetrahedrons  can swing freely and align themselves with the wind direction.  Since a wind tee or tetrahedron can also be manually set to  align with the runway in use, a pilot should also look at the  wind sock for wind information, if one is available.  

# Traffic Patterns  

At airports without an operating control tower, a segmented  circle visual indicator system ,  if installed, is designed to  provide traffic pattern information.  [Figure 14-38]  Usually  located in a position affording maximum visibility to pilots in  the air and on the ground and providing a centralized location  for other elements of the system, the segmented circle consists  of the following components: wind direction indicators,  landing direction indicators, landing strip indicators, and  traffic pattern indicators.  

A tetrahedron is installed to indicate the direction of landings  and takeoffs when conditions at the airport warrant its use.  It may be located at the center of a segmented circle and  may be lighted for night operations. The small end of the  tetrahedron points in the direction of landing. Pilots are  cautioned against using a tetrahedron for any purpose other  than as an indicator of landing direction. At airports with  control towers, the tetrahedron should only be referenced  when the control tower is not in operation. Tower instructions  supersede tetrahedron indications.  

Landing strip indicators are installed in pairs and are used to  show the alignment of landing strips.  [Figure 14-38]  Traffic  pattern indicators are arranged in pairs in conjunction with  landing strip indicators and used to indicate the direction of  turns when there is a variation from the normal left traffic  pattern. (If there is no segmented circle installed at the airport,  traffic pattern indicators may be installed on or near the end  of the runway.)  

At most airports and military air bases, traffic pattern altitudes  for propeller-driven aircraft generally extend from 600 feet  to as high as 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL). Pilots  can obtain the traffic pattern altitude for an airport from the
 Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory).  Also, traffic pattern altitudes for military turbojet aircraft  sometimes extend up to 2,500 feet AGL. Therefore, pilots of  en route aircraft should be constantly on alert for other aircraft  in traffic patterns and avoid these areas whenever possible.  When operating at an airport, traffic pattern altitudes should  be maintained unless otherwise required by the applicable  distance from cloud criteria according to Title 14 of the Code  of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.155.  Additional information on airport traffic pattern operations

can be found in Chapter 4, “Air Traffic Control,” of the AIM.  Pilots can find traffic pattern information and restrictions, such  as noise abatement in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly  Airport/Facility Directory).  

# Example: Key to Traffic Pattern Operations— Single Runway  

1.	 Enter pattern in level flight, abeam the midpoint of the runway, at pattern altitude. (1,000' AGL is recommended pattern altitude unless otherwise established.)  [Figure 14-39]  

2.	 Maintain pattern altitude until abeam approach end of  the landing runway on downwind leg.  [Figure 14-39]

 3. 	 Complete turn to final at least  $\%$   mile from the runway. [Figure 14-39]

 4.	 After takeoff or go-around, continue straight ahead until beyond departure end of runway.  [Figure 14-39]

 5.	 If remaining in the traffic pattern, commence turn to crosswind leg beyond the departure end of the runway within 300 feet of pattern altitude.  [Figure 14-39]

 6.	 If departing the traffic pattern, continue straight out, or exit with a  $45^{\circ}$   turn (to the left when in a left-hand traffic pattern; to the right when in a right-hand traffic  pattern) beyond the departure end of the runway, after  reaching pattern altitude.  [Figure 14-39]  

# Example: Key to Traffic Pattern Operations— Parallel Runways

# Radio Communications  

Operating in and out of a towered airport, as well as in a good  portion of the airspace system, requires that an aircraft have two- way radio communication capability. For this reason, a pilot  should be knowledgeable of radio station license requirements  and radio communications equipment and procedures.  

# Radio License  

There is no license requirement for a pilot operating in the  United States; however, a pilot who operates internationally  is required to hold a restricted radiotelephone permit issued  by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). There  is also no station license requirement for most general  aviation aircraft operating in the United States. A station  license is required, however, for an aircraft that is operating  internationally, that uses other than a VHF radio, and that  meets other criteria.  

# Radio Equipment  

In general aviation, the most common types of radios are  VHF. A VHF radio operates on frequencies between 118.0  megahertz (MHz) and   $136.975~\mathrm{MHz}$   and is classified as  720 or 760 depending on the number of channels it can  accommodate. The 720 and 760 use .  $.025\,\mathrm{MHz}$   (25 kilohertz  (KHz) spacing (118.025, 118.050) with the 720 having a  frequency range up to   $135.975~\mathrm{MHz}$   and the 760 reaching  up to   $136.975\:\mathrm{MHz}$  . VHF radios are limited to line of sight  transmissions; therefore, aircraft at higher altitudes are able  to transmit and receive at greater distances.  

In March of 1997, the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) amended its International Standards and Recommended  Practices to incorporate a channel plan specifying   $8.33\;\mathrm{kHz}$  channel spacings in the Aeronautical Mobile Service. The   $8.33\,\mathrm{kHz}$   channel plan was adopted to alleviate the shortage of  VHF ATC channels experienced in western Europe and in the  United Kingdom. Seven western European countries and the  United Kingdom implemented the  $8.33\,\mathrm{kHz}$   channel plan on  January 1, 1999. Accordingly, aircraft operating in the airspace  of these countries must have the capability of transmitting and  receiving on the   $8.33\,\mathrm{kHz}$   spaced channels.  

# Using Proper Radio Procedures  

Using proper radio phraseology and procedures contribute to  a pilot’s ability to operate safely and efficiently in the airspace  system. A review of the Pilot/Controller Glossary contained  in the AIM assists a pilot in the use and understanding of  

![](images/cb57acc5c23a603dcc8eee8364d9329c41a6a6c1cc68ead574b003047195468e.jpg)  
Figure 14-40.  Traffic pattern operation—parallel runways.  

standard terminology. The AIM also contains many examples  of radio communications.  

ICAO has adopted a phonetic alphabet that should be used in  radio communications. When communicating with ATC, pilots  should use this alphabet to identify their aircraft.  [Figure 14-41]  

# Lost Communication Procedures  

It is possible that a pilot might experience a malfunction of  the radio. This might cause the transmitter, receiver, or both  to become inoperative. If a receiver becomes inoperative and a  pilot needs to land at a towered airport, it is advisable to remain  outside or above Class D airspace until the direction and flow  of traffic is determined. A pilot should then advise the tower of  the aircraft type, position, altitude, and intention to land. The  pilot should continue, enter the pattern, report a position as  appropriate, and watch for light signals from the tower. Light  signal colors and their meanings are contained in  Figure 14-42 .  

If the transmitter becomes inoperative, a pilot should follow  the previously stated procedures and also monitor the  appropriate ATC frequency. During daylight hours, ATC  transmissions may be acknowledged by rocking the wings  and at night by blinking the landing light.  

When both receiver and transmitter are inoperative, the pilot  should remain outside of Class D airspace until the flow of  traffic has been determined and then enter the pattern and  watch for light signals.  

Radio malfunctions should be repaired before further  flight. If this is not possible, ATC may be contacted by  telephone requesting a VFR departure without two-way radio  communications. No radio (NORDO) procedure arrivals  are not accepted at busy airports. If authorization is given  to depart, the pilot is advised to monitor the appropriate  frequency and/or watch for light signals as appropriate.

If radio communication is lost, it may be a prudent decision  to land at a non-towered airport with lower traffic volume, if  practical. When operating at a non-towered airport, no radio  communication is necessary. However, pilots should be extra  vigilant when not using the radio. Other traffic may not as  easily be aware of your presence when they are expecting  the standard radio calls.  

# Air Traffic Control (ATC) Services  

Besides the services provided by an FSS as discussed in  Chapter 12, “Aviation Weather Services,” numerous other  services are provided by ATC. In many instances a pilot  is required to have contact with ATC, but even when not  required, a pilot may find their services helpful.  

# Primary Radar  

Radar is a device that provides information on range, azimuth,  and/or elevation of objects in the path of the transmitted  pulses. It measures the time interval between transmission and  reception of radio pulses and correlates the angular orientation  of the radiated antenna beam or beams in azimuth and/or  elevation. Range is determined by measuring the time it takes  for the radio wave to go out to the object and then return to the  receiving antenna. The direction of a detected object from a  radar site is determined by the position of the rotating antenna  when the reflected portion of the radio wave is received.  

Modern radar is very reliable and there are seldom outages.  This is due to reliable maintenance and improved equipment.  There are, however, some limitations that may affect ATC  services and prevent a controller from issuing advisories  concerning aircraft that are not under his or her control and  cannot be seen on radar.  

The characteristics of radio waves are such that they normally  travel in a continuous straight line unless they are “bent” by  atmospheric phenomena, such as temperature inversions,  reflected or attenuated by dense objects such as heavy clouds  and precipitation, or screened by high terrain features. Radar  signals degrade over distance, cannot penetrate through solid  objects such as mountains, and the fastest radar updates every  4.7 seconds.  By contrast, the satellite signals used with  Automatic Dependent Surveillance−Broadcast (ADS−B) do  not degrade over distance, provide better visibility around  mountainous terrain and allows equipped aircraft to update  their own position once a second with better accuracy.  

# ATC Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS)  

The ATC radar beacon system (ATCRBS) is often referred to  as “secondary surveillance radar.” This system consists of three  components and helps in alleviating some of the limitations  associated with primary radar. The three components are an  interrogator, transponder, and radarscope. The advantages of  ATCRBS are the reinforcement of radar targets, rapid target  identification, and a unique display of selected codes.  

Growing air traffic in the National Airspace System (NAS) will be addressed through the use of ADS-B, which not only  

![](images/ecc07ad86a413c4644ed3a7729a9f5a633481fa045d4ce5043a7d5597b8845a8.jpg)  

provides all the same information the ATCRBS, but will do  so more rapidly and with significantly more accuracy. By  broadcasting aircraft position information to a ground station,  ADS–B can also provide coverage in areas that do not have  radar coverage. In addition, ADS–B provides trajectory  information that includes speed and direction of motion.  

# Transponder  

The transponder is the airborne portion of the secondary  surveillance radar system and a system with which a pilot  should be familiar. The ATCRBS cannot display the secondary  information unless an aircraft is equipped with a transponder.  A transponder is also required to operate in certain controlled  airspace as discussed in Chapter 15, “Airspace.”  

A transponder code consists of four numbers from 0 to 7  (4,096 possible codes). There are some standard codes or ATC  may issue a four-digit code to an aircraft. When a controller  requests a code or function on the transponder, the word  “squawk” may be used.  Figure 14-43  lists some standard  transponder phraseology. Additional information concerning  transponder operation can be found in the AIM, Chapter 4.  

![Figure 14-43.  Transponder phraseology. ](images/f6f0ced2530b6f8b882e7d01f25b4f2c0b4b9abb7c9b1a545defbc1a1fe8848a.jpg)  

# Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast  (ADS-B)  

Automatic Dependent Surveillance−Broadcast (ADS−B) is a  surveillance technology being deployed throughout the NAS  to facilitate improvements needed to increase the capacity  and efficiency of the NAS, while maintaining safety. ADS-B  supports these improvements by providing a higher update rate  and enhanced accuracy of surveillance information over the  current radar-based surveillance system. In addition, ADS-B  enables the expansion of air traffic control (ATC) surveillance  services into areas where none existed previously. The ADS-B  ground system also provides Traffic Information Services- Broadcast (TIS-B) and Flight Information Services-Broadcast  (FIS-B) for use on appropriately equipped aircraft, enhancing  the user’s situational awareness (SA) and improving the  overall safety of the NAS.  

The ADS−B system is composed of aircraft avionics and a  ground infrastructure. Onboard avionics determine the position  of the aircraft by using the GPS and transmit its position,  along with additional information about the aircraft, to ground  stations for use by ATC and nearby ADS-B equipped aircraft.  

In the United States, ADS−B equipped aircraft exchange  information on one of two frequencies:  978 or   $1090\;\mathrm{MHz}$  .  The 1090 MHz frequency is associated with Mode A, C, and S  transponder operations.  ${1090}\,\mathrm{MHz}$   transponders with integrated  ADS−B functionality extend the transponder message sets with  additional ADS−B information. This additional information  is known as an “extended squitter” message and referred to as  1090ES. ADS−B equipment operating on  $978\,\mathrm{MHz}$   is known  as the Universal Access Transceiver (UAT).  

# Radar Traffic Advisories  

Radar equipped ATC facilities provide radar assistance  to aircraft on instrument flight plans and VFR aircraft  provided the aircraft can communicate with the facility and  are within radar coverage. This basic service includes safety  alerts, traffic advisories, limited vectoring when requested,  and sequencing at locations where this procedure has been  established. ATC issues traffic advisories based on observed  radar targets. The traffic is referenced by azimuth from the  aircraft in terms of the 12-hour clock. Also, distance in  nautical miles, direction in which the target is moving, and  type and altitude of the aircraft, if known, are given.  

An example would be: “Traffic 10 o’clock 5 miles east  bound, Cessna 152, 3,000 feet.” The pilot should note that  traffic position is based on the aircraft track and that wind  correction can affect the clock position at which a pilot locates  traffic. This service is not intended to relieve the pilot of the  responsibility to see and avoid other aircraft.  [Figure 14-44] In addition to basic radar service, terminal radar service  

![](images/303629cc2235fb11460ecdc906d41a77e14e85107b9c07d2e464f39bfb07cd4a.jpg)  
Figure 14-44.  Traffic advisories.  

area (TRSA) has been implemented at certain terminal  locations. TRSAs are depicted on sectional aeronautical  charts and listed in the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly  Airport/Facility Directory). The purpose of this service is to  provide separation between all participating VFR aircraft and  all IFR aircraft operating within the TRSA. Class C service  provides approved separation between IFR and VFR aircraft  and sequencing of VFR aircraft to the primary airport. Class  B service provides approved separation of aircraft based on  IFR, VFR, and/or weight and sequencing of VFR arrivals to  the primary airport(s).  

# Wake Turbulence  

All aircraft generate wake turbulence during flight. This  disturbance is caused by a pair of counter-rotating vortices  trailing from the wingtips. The vortices from larger aircraft  pose problems to encountering aircraft. The wake of these  aircraft can impose rolling moments exceeding the roll- control authority of the encountering aircraft. Also, the  turbulence generated within the vortices can damage aircraft  components and equipment if encountered at close range. For  this reason, a pilot must envision the location of the vortex  wake and adjust the flight path accordingly.  

# Vortex Generation  

Lift is generated by the creation of a pressure differential over  the wing surface. The lowest pressure occurs over the upper  wing surface and the highest pressure under the wing. This  pressure differential triggers the rollup of the airflow aft of  the wing resulting in swirling air masses trailing downstream  of the wingtips. After the rollup is completed, the wake  consists of two counter rotating cylindrical vortices. Most of  the energy lies within a few feet of the center of each vortex.  [Figure 14-45]  

![](images/bd49e2b8fa88982bd9ef710fc111b0ff132d9c5e5a31e6a8f9d12b06b866041b.jpg)  
Figure 14-45.  Vortex generation.  

# Vortex Strength Terminal Area  

Wake turbulence has historically been thought of as only  a function of aircraft weight, but recent research considers  additional parameters, such as  speed, aspects of the wing, wake  decay rates, and aircraft resistance to wake, just to name a few.  The vortex characteristics of any aircraft will be changed with  the extension of flaps or other wing configuration devices, as  well as changing speed. However, as the basic factors are weight  and speed, the vortex strength increases proportionately with  an increase in aircraft operating weight or decrease in aircraft  speed. The greatest vortex strength occurs when the generating  aircraft is heavy, slow, and clean, since the turbulence from a  “dirty” aircraft configuration hastens wake decay.  

# En Route  

En route wake turbulence events have been influenced by  changes to the aircraft fleet mix that have more “Super”  (A380) and “Heavy” (B-747, B-777, A340, etc.) aircraft  operating in the NAS. There have been wake turbulence  events in excess of 30NM and 2000 feet lower than the wake  generating aircraft. Air density is also a factor in wake strength.  Even though the speeds are higher in cruise at high altitude,  the reduced air density may result in wake strength comparable  to that in the terminal area. In addition, for a given separation  distance, the higher speeds in cruise result in less time for the  wake to decay before being encountered by a trailing aircraft.  

# Vortex Behavior  

Trailing vortices have certain behavioral characteristics  that can help a pilot visualize the wake location and take  avoidance precautions.  

Vortices are generated from the moment an aircraft leaves the  ground (until it touches down), since trailing vortices are the  byproduct of wing lift.  [Figure 14-46]  The vortex circulation  is outward, upward, and around the wingtips when viewed  from either ahead or behind the aircraft. Tests with large  

![](images/009ba635dfa8575f2d753d004366785ff8750a0e2336c7c83ef3fd5da0fa24a7.jpg)  
Figure 14-46.  Vortex behavior.  

aircraft have shown that vortices remain spaced a bit less than  a wingspan apart, drifting with the wind, at altitudes greater  than a wingspan from the ground. Tests have also shown that  the vortices sink at a rate of several hundred feet per minute,  slowing their descent and diminishing in strength with time  and distance behind the generating aircraft.  

When the vortices of larger aircraft sink close to the ground  (within 100 to 200 feet), they tend to move laterally over  the ground at a speed of 2–3 knots. A crosswind decreases  the lateral movement of the upwind vortex and increases  the movement of the downwind vortex. A light quartering  tailwind presents the worst case scenario as the wake  vortices could be all present along a significant portion of  the final approach and extended centerline and not just in the  touchdown zone as typically expected.  

# Vortex Avoidance Procedures  

The following procedures are in place to assist pilots in vortex  avoidance in the given scenario.  

•	 Landing behind a larger aircraft on the same runway— stay at or above the larger aircraft’s approach flight path and land beyond its touchdown point. [Figure 14-47A] •	 Landing behind a larger aircraft on a parallel runway closer than 2,500 feet—consider the possibility of drift and stay at or above the larger aircraft’s final approach flight path and note its touchdown point.  [Figure 14-47B] •	 Landing behind a larger aircraft on crossing runway— cross above the larger aircraft’s flight path. •	 Landing behind a departing aircraft on the same runway—land prior to the departing aircraft’s rotating point. •	 Landing behind a larger aircraft on a crossing runway—note the aircraft’s rotation point and, if that point is past the intersection, continue and land prior to the intersection. If the larger aircraft rotates prior to the intersection, avoid flight below its flight path. Abandon the approach unless a landing is ensured well  before reaching the intersection.  [Figure 14-47C] •	 Departing behind a large aircraft—rotate prior to the large aircraft’s rotation point and climb above its climb  path until turning clear of the wake. •	 For intersection takeoffs on the same runway— be alert to adjacent larger aircraft operations, particularly upwind of the runway of intended use. If an intersection takeoff clearance is received, avoid headings that cross below the larger aircraft’s path. •	 If departing or landing after a large aircraft executing a low approach, missed approach, or touch-and-go  

landing (since vortices settle and move laterally  near the ground, the vortex hazard may exist along  the runway and in the flight path, particularly in a  quartering tailwind), it is prudent to wait at least 2  minutes prior to a takeoff or landing. En route, it is advisable to avoid a path below and behind a large aircraft, and if a large aircraft is observed above on the same track, change the aircraft  position laterally and preferably upwind.  

# Collision Avoidance  

Title 14 of the CFR part 91 has established right-of-way  rules, minimum safe altitudes, and VFR cruising altitudes  to enhance flight safety. The pilot can contribute to collision  avoidance by being alert and scanning for other aircraft. This  is particularly important in the vicinity of an airport.  

Effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short,  regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive areas of  the sky into the central visual field. Each movement should not  exceed  $10^{\circ}$  , and each should be observed for at least 1 second  to enable detection. Although back and forth eye movements  seem preferred by most pilots, each pilot should develop a  scanning pattern that is most comfortable and then adhere to  it to assure optimum scanning. Even if entitled to the right-of- way, a pilot should yield if another aircraft seems too close.  

# Clearing Procedures  

The following procedures and considerations are in place to  assist pilots in collision avoidance under various situations:  

• Before takeoff—prior to taxiing onto a runway or landing area in preparation for takeoff, pilots should scan the approach area for possible landing traffic, executing appropriate maneuvers to provide a clear view of the approach areas. • Climbs and descents—during climbs and descents in flight conditions that permit visual detection of other traffic, pilots should execute gentle banks left and right at a  frequency that permits continuous visual scanning of the airspace. • Straight and level—during sustained periods of straight-and-level flight, a pilot should execute appropriate clearing procedures at periodic intervals. • Traffic patterns—entries into traffic patterns while descending should be avoided. • Traffic at VOR sites—due to converging traffic, sustained vigilance should be maintained in the vicinity of VORs and intersections. • Training operations—vigilance should be maintained and clearing turns should be made prior to a practice maneuver. During instruction, the pilot should be asked to verbalize the clearing procedures (call out “clear left, right, above, and below”).  

![](images/8c7f86cd9f35f1b39a2a1b8ee830da90434252e9c93bafe56fc2394fb36daf3d.jpg)  
Figure 14-47.  Vortex avoidance procedures.  

High-wing and low-wing aircraft have their respective  blind spots. The pilot of a high-wing aircraft should  momentarily raise the wing in the direction of the intended  turn and look for traffic prior to commencing the turn. The  pilot of a low- wing aircraft should momentarily lower the  wing and look for traffic prior to commencing the turn.  

# Training Operations  

Operators of pilot training programs are urged to adopt the  following practices:  

• Pilots undergoing flight instruction at all levels should be requested to verbalize clearing procedures (call out “clear” left, right, above, or below) to instill and sustain the habit of vigilance during maneuvering. • High-wing airplane. Momentarily raise the wing in the direction of the intended turn and look. • Low-wing airplane. Momentarily lower the wing in the direction of the intended turn and look. • Appropriate clearing procedures should precede the execution of all turns including chandelles, lazy eights, stalls, slow flight, climbs, straight and level, spins, and other combination maneuvers.  

# Scanning Techniques for Traffic Avoidance  

• Pilots must be aware of the limitations inherent in the visual scanning process. These limitations may include: • Reduced scan frequency due to concentration on flight instruments or tablets and distraction with passengers. • Blind spots related to high-wing and low-wing aircraft in addition to windshield posts and sun visors.  

• Prevailing weather conditions including reduced visibility and the position of the sun.

 • The attitude of the aircraft will create additional blind spots.

 • The physical limitations of the human eye, including the time required to (re)focus on near and far objects, from the instruments to the horizon for example; empty field myopia, narrow field of vision and atmospheric lighting all affect our ability to detect another aircraft.  

# Best practices to see and avoid:  

• ADS-B In is an effective system to help pilots see and avoid other aircraft. If your aircraft is equipped with ADS-B In, it is important to understand its features and how to use it properly. Many units provide visual and/or audio alerts to supplement the system's traffic display. Pilots should incorporate the traffic display in their normal traffic scan to provide awareness of nearby aircraft. Prior to taxiing onto an airport movement area, ADS-B In can provide advance indication of arriving aircraft and aircraft in the traffic pattern. Systems that incorporate a traffic-  alerting feature can help minimize the pilot's inclination to fixate on the display. Refer to 4-5- 7e, ADS-B Limitations.

 • Understand the limitations of ADS-B In. In certain airspace, not all aircraft will be equipped with ADS-B Out or transponders and will not be visible on your ADS-B In display.

 • Limit the amount of time that you focus on flight instruments or tablets.

 • Develop a strategic approach to scanning for traffic. Scan the entire sky and try not to focus straight ahead.  

# Pilot Deviations (PDs)  

A pilot deviation (PD) is an action of a pilot that violates any  Federal Aviation Regulation. While PDs should be avoided,  the regulations do authorize deviations from a clearance in  response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance  system resolution advisory. You must notify ATC as soon as  possible following a deviation.  

Pilot deviations can occur in several different  ways. Airborne deviations result when a pilot  strays from an assigned heading or altitude or from  an instrument procedure, or if the pilot penetrates  controlled or restricted airspace without ATC clearance.  

To prevent airborne deviations, follow these steps:  

• Plan each flight—you may have flown the flight many times before but conditions and situations can change rapidly, such as in the case of a pop-up temporary flight restriction (TFR). Take a few minutes prior to each flight to plan accordingly. • Talk and squawk—Proper communication with ATC has its benefits. Flight following often makes the controller’s job easier because they can better integrate VFR and IFR traffic. • Give yourself some room—GPS is usually more precise than ATC radar. Using your GPS to fly up to and along the line of the airspace you are trying to avoid could result in a pilot deviation because ATC radar may show you within the restricted airspace.  

Ground deviations (also called surface deviations) include  taxiing, taking off, or landing without clearance, deviating  from an assigned taxi route, or failing to hold short of an  assigned clearance limit. To prevent ground deviations, stay  alert during ground operations. Pilot deviations can and  frequently do occur on the ground. Many strategies and tactics  pilots use to avoid airborne deviations also work on the ground.  

Pilots should also remain vigilant about vehicle/pedestrian  deviations  (V/PDs).  A  vehicle  or  pedestrian  deviation includes pedestrians, vehicles or other objects  interfering with aircraft operations by entering or  moving  on  the  runway  movement  area  without  authorization from air traffic control. In serious  instances, any ground deviation (PD or VPD) can result  in a runway incursion. Best practices in preventing  ground deviations can be found in the following section  under runway incursion avoidance.  

# Runway Incursion Avoidance  

A runway incursion is “any occurrence in the airport runway  environment involving an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object  on the ground that creates a collision hazard or results in a loss  of required separation with an aircraft taking off, intending  to take off, landing, or intending to land.” It is important  to give the same attention to operating on the surface as in  other phases of flights. Proper planning can prevent runway  incursions and the possibility of a ground collision. A pilot  should always be aware of the aircraft’s position on the  surface at all times and be aware of other aircraft and vehicle  operations on the airport. At times, towered airports can be  busy and taxi instructions complex. In this situation, it may  be advisable to write down taxi instructions. The following  are some practices to help prevent a runway incursion:  

• Read back all runway crossing and/or hold instructions. • Review airport layouts as part of preflight planning, before descending to land and while taxiing, as needed. • Know airport signage. • Review NOTAM for information on runway/ taxiway closures and construction areas. • Request progressive taxi instructions from ATC when unsure of the taxi route. • Check for traffic before crossing any runway hold line and before entering a taxiway. • Turn on aircraft lights and the rotating beacon or strobe lights while taxing. • When landing, clear the active runway as soon as possible, then wait for taxi instructions before further movement. • Study and use proper phraseology in order to understand and respond to ground control instructions. • Write down complex taxi instructions at unfamiliar airports.  

Approximately three runway incursions occur each day at  towered airports within the United States. The potential  that these numbers present for a catastrophic accident  is unacceptable. The following are examples of pilot  deviations, operational incidents (OI), and vehicle (driver)  deviations that may lead to runway incursions.  

Pilot Deviations:  

•	 Crossing a runway hold marking without clearance from ATC •	 Taking off without clearance •	 Landing without clearance  

Operational Incidents (OI):  

•	 Clearing an aircraft onto a runway while another aircraft is landing on the same runway •	 Issuing a takeoff clearance while the runway is occupied by another aircraft or vehicle  

Vehicle (Driver) Deviations:  

•	 Crossing a runway hold marking without ATC clearance  

According to FAA data, approximately 65 percent of all  runway incursions are caused by pilots.  Of the pilot runway  incursions, FAA data shows almost half of those incursions  are caused by GA pilots.  

# Causal Factors of Runway Incursions  

Detailed investigations of runway incursions over the past  10 years have identified three major areas contributing to  these events:  

•	 Failure to comply with ATC instructions •	 Lack of airport familiarity •	 Nonconformance with standard operating procedures  

Clear, concise, and effective pilot/controller communication is  paramount to safe airport surface operations. You must fully  understand and comply with all ATC instructions. It is mandatory  to read back all runway “ hold short ” instructions verbatim.  

Taxiing on an unfamiliar airport can be very challenging,  especially during hours of darkness or low visibility. A  request may be made for progressive taxi instructions which  include step by step taxi routing instructions. Ensure you  have a current airport diagram, remain “heads-up” with eyes  outside, and devote your entire attention to surface navigation  per ATC clearance. All checklists should be completed while  the aircraft is stopped. There is no place for non-essential  chatter or other activities while maintaining vigilance during  taxi.  [Figure 14-48]  

# Runway Confusion  

Runway confusion is a subset of runway incursions and  often results in you unintentionally taking off or landing on  a taxiway or wrong runway. Generally, you are unaware of  the mistake until after it has occurred.  

![](images/564dc96da0aad96bf6fb29df274222d4eed66ea448540bca415b7c28f7b63c8e.jpg)  
Figure 14-48.  Heads-up, eyes outside.  

In August 2006, the flight crew of a commercial regional jet  was cleared for takeoff on Runway 22 but mistakenly lined  up and departed on Runway 26, a much shorter runway. As  a result, the aircraft crashed off the end of the runway.  

# Causal Factors of Runway Confusion  

There are three major factors that increase the risk of runway  confusion and can lead to a wrong runway departure:  

•	 Airport complexity •	 Close proximity of runway thresholds •	 Joint use of a runway as a taxiway  

Not only can airport complexity contribute to a runway  incursion; it can also play a significant role in runway  confusion. If you are operating at an unfamiliar airport and  need assistance in executing the taxi clearance, do not hesitate  to ask ATC for help. Always carry a current airport diagram  and trace or highlight your taxi route to the departure runway  prior to leaving the ramp.  

If you are operating from an airport with runway thresholds  in close proximity to one another, exercise extreme caution  when taxiing onto the runway.  Figure 14-49  shows a perfect  example of a taxiway leading to multiple runways that may  cause confusion. If departing on Runway 36, ensure that you  set your aircraft heading “bug” to  $360^{\circ}$  , and align your aircraft  to the runway heading to avoid departing from the wrong  runway. Before adding power, make one last instrument scan  to ensure the aircraft heading and runway heading are aligned. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to  use a runway as a taxiway. For example, during airport  construction some taxiways may be closed requiring re- routing of traffic onto runways. In other cases, departing  traffic may be required to back taxi on the runway in order  to utilize the full runway length.  

![](images/d0ea7d7b97dda84e23c3529208469a57ab0ab1c050cae41518b4015f8ace734a.jpg)  
Figure 14-49.  Confusing runway/runway intersection.  

Since inattention and confusion often are factors contributing to  runway incursion, it is important to remain extremely cautious  and maintain situational awareness (SA). When instructed to  use a runway as a taxiway, do not become confused and take  off on the runway you are using as a taxiway.  

# ATC Instructions  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part  91, section 91.123 requires you to follow all ATC clearances  and instructions. Request clarification if you are unsure of the  clearance or instruction to be followed. If you are unfamiliar  with the airport or unsure of a taxi route, ask ATC for a  “progressive taxi.” Progressive taxi requires the controller  to provide step-by-step taxi instructions.  

The final decision to act on ATC’s instruction rests with you.  If you cannot safely comply with any of ATC’s instructions,  inform them immediately by using the word “UNABLE.”  There is nothing wrong with telling a controller that you are  unable to safely comply with the clearance.  

Another way to mitigate the risk of runway incursions is to  write down all taxi instructions as soon as they are received  from ATC.  [Figure 14-50]  It is also helpful to monitor ATC  clearances and instructions that are issued to other aircraft.  You should be especially vigilant if another aircraft has a  similar sounding call sign so there is no mistake about who  ATC is contacting or to whom they are giving instructions  and clearances.  

Read back your complete ATC clearance with your aircraft  call sign. This gives ATC the opportunity to clarify any  misunderstandings and ensure that instructions were given to  the correct aircraft. If, at any time, there is uncertainty about  any ATC instructions or clearances, ask ATC to “say again”  or ask for progressive taxi instructions.  

# ATC Instructions — “ Hold Short”  

The most important sign and marking on the airport is the  hold sign and hold marking. These are located on a stub  taxiway leading directly to a runway. They depict the holding  position or the location where the aircraft is to stop so as not to  enter the runway environment.  [Figure 14-51]  For example,  Figure 14-52  shows the holding position sign and marking  for Runway 13 and Runway 31.  

When ATC issues a “ hold short ” clearance, you are  expected to taxi up to, but not cross any part of the runway  holding marking. At a towered airport, runway hold  markings should never be crossed without explicit ATC  instructions. Do not enter a runway at a towered airport  unless instructions are given from ATC to cross, takeoff  from, or “line up and wait” on that specific runway.  

ATC is required to obtain a read-back from the pilot of  all runway “ hold short ” instructions. Therefore, you  must read back the entire clearance and “ hold short ”  instruction, to include runway identifier and your call sign.  

![](images/2f562b525790cba1e4c70dea922566a3acf82e10633067bb7b1cf8b813d07486.jpg)  
Figure 14-50.  A sound practice is to write down taxi instructions  from ATC.

Figure 14-51.  Do NOT cross a runway holding position marking  without ATC clearance. If the tower is closed or you are operating  from a non-towered airport, check both directions for conflicting  traffic before crossing the hold position marking.  

Figure 14-53  shows an example of a controller’s taxi and “ hold  short ” instructions and the reply from the pilot.  

# ATC Instructions—Explicit Runway Crossing  

As of June 30, 2010, ATC is required to issue explicit  instructions to “ cross ” or “ hold short ” of each runway.  Instructions to “ cross ” a runway are normally issued one at a  time, and an aircraft must have crossed the previous runway  before another runway crossing is issued. Exceptions may  apply for closely spaced runways that have less than 1,000  feet between centerlines. This applies to all runways to include  active, inactive, or closed.  Figure 14-54  shows communication  between ATC and a pilot who is requesting a taxi clearance.  Extra caution should be used when directed by ATC to  taxi onto or across a runway, especially at night and during  reduced visibility conditions. Always comply with “ hold

short ” or crossing instructions when approaching an entrance  to a runway. Scan the full length of the runway and the final  approaches before entering or crossing any runway, even if  ATC has issued a clearance.  

# ATC Instructions—“Line Up and Wait” (LUAW)  

ATC now uses the “line up and wait” (LUAW) instruction  when a takeoff clearance cannot be issued immediately due  to traffic or other reasons. The words “line up and wait” have  replaced “position and hold” in directing you to taxi onto a  runway and await takeoff clearance.  

An ATC instruction to “line up and wait” is not a clearance  for takeoff. It is only a clearance to enter the runway and  hold in position for takeoff. Under LUAW phraseology, the  controller states the aircraft call sign, departure runway, and  “line up and wait.” Be aware that “traffic holding in position”  will continue to be used to advise other aircraft that traffic  has been authorized to line up and wait on an active runway.  Pay close attention when instructed to “line up and wait,”  especially at night or during periods of low visibility. Before

entering the runway, remember to scan the full length of the  runway and its approach end for other aircraft.  

There have been collisions and incidents involving aircraft  instructed to “line up and wait” while ATC waits for the  necessary conditions to issue a takeoff clearance. An OI  caused a 737 to land on a runway occupied by a twin-engine  turboprop. The turboprop was holding in position awaiting  takeoff clearance. Upon landing, the 737 collided with the  twin-engine turboprop.  

When ATC instructs you to “line up and wait,” they should  advise you of any anticipated delay in receiving your takeoff  clearance. Possible reasons for ATC takeoff clearance delays  may include other aircraft landing and/or departing, wake  turbulence, or traffic crossing an intersecting runway.  

•	 If advised of a reason for the delay, or the reason is clearly visible, expect an imminent takeoff clearance once the reason is no longer an issue. •	 If a takeoff clearance is not received within 90 seconds after receiving the “line up and wait” instruction, contact ATC immediately. •	 When ATC issues “line up and wait” instructions and takeoff clearances from taxiway intersection, the taxiway designator is included.	 Example – “N123AG Runway One-Eight, at Charlie Three, line up and wait.”	 Example – “N123AG Runway One-Eight, at Charlie Three, cleared for takeoff.”  

If LUAW procedures are being used and landing traffic is a  factor, ATC is required to:  

•	 Inform the aircraft in the LUAW position of the closest aircraft that is requesting a full-stop, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, option, or unrestricted low approach.	 Example – “N123AG, Runway One-Eight, line up and wait, traffic a Cessna 210 on a six-mile final.” •	 In some cases, where safety logic is being used, ATC is permitted to issue landing clearances with traffic in  the LUAW position. Traffic information is issued to the landing traffic.	 Example – “N456HK, Runway One-Eight, cleared to  land, traffic a DeHavilland Otter holding in position.”	 NOTE: ATC will/must issue a takeoff clearance to the  traffic holding in position in sufficient time to ensure no conflict exists with landing aircraft. Prescribed runway separation must exist no later than when the landing aircraft crosses the threshold.  

•	 In cases where ATC is not permitted to issue landing clearances with traffic in the LUAW position, traffic information is issued to the closest aircraft that is requesting a full-stop, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, option, or unrestricted low approach.	 Example – “N456HK, Runway One-Eight, continue, traffic holding in position.”  

# ATC Instructions — “ Runway Shortened”  

You should review NOTAMs in your preflight planning to  determine any airport changes that will affect your departure  or arrival. When the available runway length has been  temporarily or permanently shortened due to construction,  the ATIS includes the words “warning” and “shortened” in  the text of the message. For the duration of the construction  when the runway is temporarily shortened, ATC will  include the word “shortened” in their clearance instructions.  Furthermore, the use of the term “full length” will not be used  by ATC during this period of the construction.  

Some examples of ATC instructions are:  

•	 “Runway three six shortened, line up and wait.” •	 “Runway three six shortened, cleared for takeoff.” •	 “Runway three six shortened, cleared to land.”  

When an intersection departure is requested on a temporarily  or permanently shortened runway during the construction,  the remaining length of runway is included in the clearance.  For example, “Runway three six at Echo, intersection  departure, 5,600 feet available.” If following the construction,  the runway is permanently shortened, ATC will include  the word “shortened” until the Chart Supplement U.S.  (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) is updated to include  the permanent changes to the runway length.  

# Pre-Landing, Landing, and After-Landing  

While en route and after receiving the destination airport  ATIS/landing information, review the airport diagram and  brief yourself as to your exit taxiway. Determine the following:  

•	 Are there any runway hold markings in close proximity to the exit taxiway? •	 Do not cross any hold markings or exit onto any runways without ATC clearance.  

After landing, use the utmost caution where the exit taxiways  intersect another runway, and do not exit onto another runway  without ATC authorization. Do not accept last minute  turnoff instructions from the control tower unless you clearly  understand the instructions and are at a speed that ensures you  can safely comply. Finally, after landing and upon exiting  the runway, ensure your aircraft has completely crossed over  the runway hold markings. Once all parts of the aircraft have  crossed the runway holding position markings, you must hold  unless further instructions have been issued by ATC. Do not  initiate non-essential communications or actions until the  aircraft has stopped and the brakes set.  

# Engineered Materials Arresting Systems  (EMAS)  

Aircraft can and do overrun the ends of runways and  sometimes with devastating results. An overrun occurs  when an aircraft passes beyond the end of a runway during  an aborted takeoff or on landing rollout. To minimize the  hazards of overruns, the FAA incorporated the concept of  a runway safety area (RSA) beyond the runway end into  airport design standards. At most commercial airports, the  RSA is 500 feet wide and extends 1,000 feet beyond each  end of the runway. The FAA implemented this requirement  in the event that an aircraft overruns, undershoots, or veers  off the side of the runway.  

The most dangerous of these incidents are overruns, but  since many airports were built before the 1,000-foot RSA  length was adopted some 20 years ago, the area beyond the  end of the runway is where many airports cannot achieve the  full standard RSA. This is due to obstacles, such as bodies  of water, highways, railroads, populated areas, or severe  drop-off of terrain. Under these specific circumstances, the  installation of an Engineered Materials Arresting System  (EMAS) is an acceptable alternative to a RSA beyond the  runway end. It provides a level of safety that is generally  equivalent to a full RSA.  [Figure 14-55]  

An EMAS uses materials of closely controlled strength and  density placed at the end of a runway to stop or greatly slow  an aircraft that overruns the runway. The best material found  to date is a lightweight, crushable concrete. When an aircraft  rolls into an EMAS arrestor bed, the tires of the aircraft sink  into the lightweight concrete and the aircraft is decelerated  by having to roll through the material.  [Figure 14-56]  

# Incidents  

To date, there have been several incidents listed below where the EMAS technology has worked successfully to arrest  aircraft that overrun the runway. All cases have resulted in minimal to do damage to the aircraft. The only known injury was an ankle injury to a passenger during egress following the arrestment.  [Figure 14-57]

[Figure 14-58] •	 October 2010—A G-4 Gulfstream overran the runway at Teterboro Airport (KTEB) in Teterboro, New Jersey (NJ). •	 November 2011—A Cessna Citation 550 overran the runway at Key West International Airport (KEYW) in Key West, Florida.  

# EMAS Installations and Information  

Currently, EMAS is installed at 63 runway ends at 42 airports  in the United States with plans to install more throughout the  next few years.  

EMAS information is available in the Chart Supplement  U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory) under the specific  airport information.  Figure 14-59  shows airport information  for Boston Logan International Airport. At the bottom of the  page, it shows which runways are equipped with arresting  systems and the type that they have. It is important for pilots  to study airport information, become familiar with the details  and limitations of the arresting system, and the runways that  are equipped with them.  [Figure 14-60]  

•	 May 1999—A Saab 340 commuter aircraft overran the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).  

![](images/d1f81546c9d07a2b9e97e34ee28b31e7c831eeb94a45f8ee7c0992bb810d6609.jpg)  
An EMASMAX bed is typically the full width of the runway and the arrestor bed is set-back from the end of the runway.  

![](images/cb67650b5c856191aefc0f880ca1153c795e06dbcc7ff03fe1232fff9129b9b0.jpg)  
The front of an EMASMAX bed includes a lead-in ramp to transition the aircraft into the material.

Figure 14-56.  Diagram of an EMASMAX system.  

# Pilot Considerations  

Although engaging an EMAS should not be a desired  outcome for the end of a flight, pilots need to know what  EMAS is, how to identify it on the airfield diagram and  on the airfield, as well as knowing what to do should they  find themselves approaching an installation in an overrun  situation.  [Figure 14-59  and  Figure 14-60]  Pilots also need  to know that an EMAS may not stop lightweight general  aviation aircraft that are not heavy enough to sink into the  crushable concrete. The time to discuss whether or not a  runway has an EMAS at the end is during the pre-departure  briefing prior to takeoff or during the approach briefing prior  to commencing the approach. Following the guidance below  ensures that the aircraft engages the EMAS according to the  design entry parameters.  

During the takeoff or landing phase, if a pilot determines that  the aircraft will exit the runway end and enter the EMAS, the  following guidance should be adhered to:  

1.	 Continue deceleration - Regardless of aircraft speed upon exiting the runway, continue to follow Rejected/  Aborted Takeoff procedures, or if landing, Maximum  Braking procedures outlined in the Flight Manual.  

![](images/4983c09667779713cd49f7198bff3637a93a7d981c2ebd93bba8d7d7651ad7c8.jpg)  
Figure 14-57.  There have been several incidents where the EMAS  has successfully arrested the aircraft.  

2.	 Maintain runway centerline - Not veering left or right of the bed and continuing straight ahead will maximize stopping capability of the EMAS bed. The quality of deceleration will be best within the confines of the bed. 3.	 Maintain deceleration efforts - The arrestor bed is a passive system, so this is the only action required by the pilot. 4.	 Once stopped, do not attempt to taxi or otherwise move the aircraft.

# Chapter 15 Airspace  

# Introduction  

The two categories of airspace are: regulatory and  nonregulatory. Within these two categories, there are four  types: controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and other  airspace. The categories and types of airspace are dictated  by the complexity or density of aircraft movements, nature  of the operations conducted within the airspace, the level of  safety required, and national and public interest.  Figure 15-1   presents a profile view of the dimensions of various classes  of airspace. Also, there are excerpts from sectional charts  that are discussed in Chapter 16, Navigation, that are used  to illustrate how airspace is depicted.  

![](images/ca76ef1ed837da79cbecdc77cf845486e0784c2905fc2623c0b2dbfcfa6761d7.jpg)  
Figure 15-1.  Airspace profile.  

# Controlled Airspace  

Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the  different classifications of airspace and defined dimensions  within which air traffic control (ATC) service is provided  in accordance with the airspace classification. Controlled  airspace consists of:  

• 	 Class A • 	 Class B • 	 Class C • 	 Class D • 	 Class E  

# Class A Airspace  

Class A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000 feet  mean sea level (MSL) up to and including flight level (FL)  600, including the airspace overlying the waters within 12  nautical miles (NM) of the coast of the 48 contiguous states  and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized, all operation in Class  A airspace is conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR).  

# Class B Airspace  

Class B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to  10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports in  terms of airport operations or passenger enplanements. The  configuration of each Class B airspace area is individually  tailored, consists of a surface area and two or more layers  (some Class B airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding  cakes), and is designed to contain all published instrument  procedures once an aircraft enters the airspace. ATC  clearance is required for all aircraft to operate in the area,  and all aircraft that are so cleared receive separation services  within the airspace.  

# Class C Airspace  

Class C airspace is generally airspace from the surface to  4,000 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL)  surrounding those airports that have an operational control  tower, are serviced by a radar approach control, and have a  certain number of IFR operations or passenger enplanements.  Although the configuration of each Class C area is  individually tailored, the airspace usually consists of a surface  area with a five NM radius, an outer circle with a ten NM  radius that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet above the  airport elevation. Each aircraft must establish two-way radio  communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic  services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter must  maintain those communications while within the airspace.  

# Class D Airspace  

Class D airspace is generally airspace from the surface to  2,500 feet above the airport elevation (charted in MSL)  surrounding those airports that have an operational control  tower. The configuration of each Class D airspace area is  individually tailored and, when instrument procedures are  published, the airspace is normally designed to contain the  procedures. Arrival extensions for instrument approach  procedures (IAPs) may be Class D or Class E airspace. Unless  otherwise authorized, each aircraft must establish two-way  radio communications with the ATC facility providing air  traffic services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter  maintain those communications while in the airspace.  

# Class E Airspace  

Class E airspace is the controlled airspace not classified as  Class A, B, C, or D airspace. A large amount of the airspace  over the United States is designated as Class   $\mathrm{E}$   airspace.  

This provides sufficient airspace for the safe control and  separation of aircraft during IFR operations. Chapter 3 of  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) explains the  various types of Class E airspace.  

Sectional and other charts depict all locations of Class E  airspace with bases below 14,500 feet MSL. In areas where  charts do not depict a class E base, class E begins at 14,500  feet MSL.  

In most areas, the Class E airspace base is 1,200 feet AGL. In  many other areas, the Class E airspace base is either the surface  or 700 feet AGL. Some Class E airspace begins at an MSL  altitude depicted on the charts, instead of an AGL altitude.  

Class E airspace typically extends up to, but not including,  18,000 feet MSL (the lower limit of Class A airspace). All  airspace above FL 600 is Class E airspace.  

# Uncontrolled Airspace  

# Class G Airspace  

Uncontrolled airspace or Class G airspace is the portion of  the airspace that has not been designated as Class A, B, C,  D, or E. It is therefore designated uncontrolled airspace.  Class G airspace extends from the surface to the base of the  overlying Class E airspace. Although ATC has no authority  or responsibility to control air traffic, pilots should remember  there are visual flight rules (VFR) minimums that apply to  Class G airspace.  

# Special Use Airspace  

Special use airspace or special area of operation (SAO)  is the designation for airspace in which certain activities  must be confined, or where limitations may be imposed  on aircraft operations that are not part of those activities.  Certain special use airspace areas can create limitations on  the mixed use of airspace. The special use airspace depicted  on instrument charts includes the area name or number,  effective altitude, time and weather conditions of operation,  the controlling agency, and the chart panel location. On  National Aeronautical Charting Group (NACG) en route  charts, this information is available on one of the end panels.  Special use airspace usually consists of:  

• 	 Prohibited areas • 	 Restricted areas • 	 Warning areas • 	 Military operation areas (MOAs) • 	 Alert areas • 	 Controlled firing areas (CFAs)  

# Prohibited Areas  

Prohibited areas contain airspace of defined dimensions  within which the flight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas  are established for security or other reasons associated with  the national welfare. These areas are published in the Federal  Register and are depicted on aeronautical charts. The area is  charted as a “P” followed by a number (e.g., P-40). Examples  of prohibited areas include Camp David and the National  Mall in Washington, D.C., where the White House and the  Congressional buildings are located.  [Figure 15-2]  

# Restricted Areas  

Restricted areas are areas where operations are hazardous to  non participating aircraft and contain airspace within which  the flight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject  to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be confined  because of their nature, or limitations may be imposed upon  aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or  both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often  invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g., artillery firing, aerial  gunnery, or guided missiles). IFR flights may be authorized  to transit the airspace and are routed accordingly. Penetration  of restricted areas without authorization from the using  or controlling agency may be extremely hazardous to the  aircraft and its occupants. ATC facilities apply the following  procedures when aircraft are operating on an IFR clearance  (including those cleared by ATC to maintain VFR on top) via  a route that lies within joint-use restricted airspace:  

1. 	 If the restricted area is not active and has been released  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the  ATC facility allows the aircraft to operate in the  restricted airspace without issuing specific clearance  for it to do so. 2. 	 If the restricted area is active and has not been released  to the FAA, the ATC facility issues a clearance that  ensures the aircraft avoids the restricted airspace.  

![](images/f4bfdf7cf9eb4f5da573e8e56e1547b02490180e386b87ee1b36425b525e39ab.jpg)  
Figure 15-2.  An example of a prohibited area, P-40 around Camp  David.  

Restricted areas are charted with an “R” followed by a  number (e.g., R-4401) and are depicted on the en route  chart appropriate for use at the altitude or FL being flown.  [Figure 15-3]  Restricted area information can be obtained  on the back of the chart.  

# Warning Areas  

Warning areas are similar in nature to restricted areas;  however, the United States government does not have sole  jurisdiction over the airspace. A warning area is airspace of  defined dimensions, extending from 3 NM outward from  the coast of the United States, containing activity that may  be hazardous to non participating aircraft. The purpose of  such areas is to warn non participating pilots of the potential  danger. A warning area may be located over domestic or  international waters or both. The airspace is designated with  a “W” followed by a number (e.g., W-237).  [Figure 15-4]  

# Military Operation Areas (MOAs)  

MOAs consist of airspace with defined vertical and lateral  limits established for the purpose of separating certain  military training activities from IFR traffic. Whenever an  MOA is being used, non participating IFR traffic may be  cleared through an MOA if IFR separation can be provided by  ATC. Otherwise, ATC reroutes or restricts non participating  IFR traffic. MOAs are depicted on sectional, VFR terminal  area, and en route low altitude charts and are not numbered  (e.g., “Camden Ridge MOA”).  [Figure 15-5]  However, the  MOA is also further defined on the back of the sectional  charts with times of operation, altitudes affected, and the  controlling agency.  

# Alert Areas  

Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts with an “A”  followed by a number (e.g., A-211) to inform non participating  

![](images/e0468ebec1ad38ad72b04e9337c02146ae5c12342925cec5ee4cc503ba1c5e5e.jpg)

pilots of areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training  or an unusual type of aerial activity. Pilots should exercise  caution in alert areas. All activity within an alert area shall  be conducted in accordance with regulations, without waiver,  and pilots of participating aircraft, as well as pilots transiting  the area, shall be equally responsible for collision avoidance.  [Figure 15-6]  

# Controlled Firing Areas (CFAs)  

CFAs contain activities that, if not conducted in a controlled  environment, could be hazardous to non participating aircraft.  The difference between CFAs and other special use airspace  is that activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft,  radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraft might  be approaching the area. There is no need to chart CFAs  since they do not cause a non participating aircraft to change  its flight path.  

# Other Airspace Areas  

“Other airspace areas” is a general term referring to the  majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:  

• 	 Local airport advisory (LAA) • 	 Military training route (MTR) • 	 Temporary flight restriction (TFR) • 	 Parachute jump aircraft operations • 	 Published VFR routes • 	 Terminal radar service area (TRSA) • 	 National security area (NSA) • 	 Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ) land and  water based and need for Defense VFR (DVFR) flight  plan to operate VFR in this airspace • 	 Intercept Procedures and use of 121.5 for  communication if not on ATC already

• 	 Flight Restricted Zones (FRZ) in vicinity of Capitol  and White House • 	 Special Awareness Training required by  14 CFR 91.161 for pilots to operate VFR within 60  NM of the Washington, DC VOR/DME • 	 Wildlife Areas/Wilderness Areas/National Parks and  request to operate above 2,000 AGL • 	 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA) Marine Areas off the coast with requirement  to operate above 2,000 AGL • 	 Tethered Balloons for observation and weather  recordings that extend on cables up to 60,000  

# Local Airport Advisory (LAA)  

An advisory service provided by Flight Service Station  (FSS) facilities, which are located on the landing airport,  using a discrete ground-to-air frequency or the tower  frequency when the tower is closed. LAA services include  local airport advisories, automated weather reporting with  voice broadcasting, and a continuous Automated Surface  Observing System (ASOS)/Automated Weather Observing  Station (AWOS) data display, other continuous direct reading  instruments, or manual observations available to the specialist.  

# Military Training Routes (MTRs)  

MTRs are routes used by military aircraft to maintain  proficiency in tactical flying. These routes are usually  established below 10,000 feet MSL for operations at speeds  in excess of 250 knots. Some route segments may be defined  at higher altitudes for purposes of route continuity. Routes  are identified as IFR (IR), and VFR (VR), followed by  a number.  [Figure 15-7]  MTRs with no segment above  1,500 feet AGL are identified by four number characters  (e.g., IR1206, VR1207). MTRs that include one or more  segments above 1,500 feet AGL are identified by three  number characters (e.g., IR206, VR207). IFR low altitude  en route charts depict all IR routes and all VR routes that

accommodate operations above 1,500 feet AGL. IR routes  are conducted in accordance with IFR regardless of weather  conditions. VFR sectional charts depict military training  activities, such as IR, VR, MOA, restricted area, warning  area, and alert area information.  

# Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR)  

A flight data center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)  is issued to designate a TFR. The NOTAM begins with  the phrase “FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS” followed by the  location of the temporary restriction, effective time period,  area defined in statute miles, and altitudes affected. The  NOTAM also contains the FAA coordination facility and  telephone number, the reason for the restriction, and any other  information deemed appropriate. The pilot should check the  NOTAMs as part of flight planning.  

Some of the purposes for establishing a TFR are:  

• 	 Protect persons and property in the air or on the surface  from an existing or imminent hazard. • 	 Provide a safe environment for the operation of  disaster relief aircraft. • 	 Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft  above an incident or event, that may generate a high  degree of public interest. • 	 Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian  reasons in the State of Hawaii. • 	 Protect the President, Vice President, or other public  figures. • 	 Provide a safe environment for space agency  operations.  

Since the events of September 11, 2001, the use of TFRs has  become much more common. There have been a number of  incidents of aircraft incursions into TFRs that have resulted  in pilots undergoing security investigations and certificate  suspensions. It is a pilot’s responsibility to be aware of TFRs  in their proposed area of flight. One way to check is to visit  the FAA website, www.tfr.faa.gov, and verify that there is  not a TFR in the area.  

# Parachute Jump Aircraft Operations  

Parachute jump aircraft operations are published in the Chart  Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility Directory). Sites  that are used frequently are depicted on sectional charts.  

# Published VFR Routes  

Published VFR routes are for transitioning around, under, or  through some complex airspace. Terms such as VFR flyway,  VFR corridor, Class B airspace VFR transition route, and  terminal area VFR route have been applied to such routes.  

These routes are generally found on VFR terminal area  planning charts.  

# Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSAs)  

TRSAs are areas where participating pilots can receive  additional radar services. The purpose of the service is  to provide separation between all IFR operations and  participating VFR aircraft.  

The primary airport(s) within the TRSA become(s) Class D  airspace. The remaining portion of the TRSA overlies other  controlled airspace, which is normally Class E airspace  beginning at 700 or 1,200 feet and established to transition to/ from the en route/terminal environment. TRSAs are depicted  on VFR sectional charts and terminal area charts with a solid  black line and altitudes for each segment. The Class D portion  is charted with a blue segmented line. Participation in TRSA  services is voluntary; however, pilots operating under VFR  are encouraged to contact the radar approach control and take  advantage of TRSA service.  

# National Security Areas (NSAs)  

NSAs consist of airspace of defined vertical and lateral  dimensions established at locations where there is a  requirement for increased security and safety of ground  facilities. Flight in NSAs may be temporarily prohibited by  regulation under the provisions of Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 99, and prohibitions are  disseminated via NOTAM. Pilots are requested to voluntarily  avoid flying through these depicted areas.  

# Air Traffic Control and the National  Airspace System  

The primary purpose of the ATC system is to prevent a  collision between aircraft operating in the system and to  organize and expedite the flow of traffic. In addition to  its primary function, the ATC system has the capability to  provide (with certain limitations) additional services. The  ability to provide additional services is limited by many  factors, such as the volume of traffic, frequency congestion,  quality of radar, controller workload, higher priority duties,  and the pure physical inability to scan and detect those  situations that fall in this category. It is recognized that these  services cannot be provided in cases in which the provision  of services is precluded by the above factors.  

Consistent with the aforementioned conditions, controllers  shall provide additional service procedures to the extent  permitted by higher priority duties and other circumstances.  The provision of additional services is not optional on the  part of the controller, but rather is required when the work  situation permits. Provide ATC service in accordance with  the procedures and minima in this order except when:  

1. 	 A deviation is necessary to conform to ICAO  Documents, National Rules of the Air, or special  agreements where the United States provides ATC  service in airspace outside the country and its  possessions 2. 	 Other procedures/minima are prescribed in a letter of  agreement, FAA directive, or a military document  3. 	 A deviation is necessary to assist an aircraft when an  emergency has been declared  

# Coordinating the Use of Airspace  

ATC is responsible for ensuring that the necessary  coordination has been accomplished before allowing an  aircraft under their control to enter another controller’s area  of jurisdiction.  

Before issuing control instructions directly or relaying  through another source to an aircraft that is within another  controller’s area of jurisdiction that will change that  aircraft’s heading, route, speed, or altitude, ATC ensures  that coordination has been accomplished with each of the  controllers listed below whose area of jurisdiction is affected  by those instructions unless otherwise specified by a letter  of agreement or a facility directive:  

1. 	 The controller within whose area of jurisdiction the  control instructions are issued 2. 	 The controller receiving the transfer of control 3. 	 Any intervening controller(s) through whose area of  jurisdiction the aircraft will pass  

If ATC issues control instructions to an aircraft through a  source other than another controller (e.g., Aeronautical Radio,  Incorporated (ARINC), FSS, another pilot), they ensure that  the necessary coordination has been accomplished with any  controllers listed above, whose area of jurisdiction is affected  by those instructions unless otherwise specified by a letter  of agreement or a facility directive.  

# Operating in the Various Types of Airspace  

It is important that pilots be familiar with the operational  requirements for each of the various types or classes of  airspace. Subsequent sections cover each class in sufficient  detail to facilitate understanding regarding weather, type of  pilot certificate held, and equipment required.  

# Basic VFR Weather Minimums  

No pilot may operate an aircraft under basic VFR when the  flight visibility is less, or at a distance from clouds that is  less, than that prescribed for the corresponding altitude and  class of airspace.  [Figure 15-8]  Except as provided in 14 CFR  part 91, section 91.157, “Special VFR Weather Minimums,”  

![](images/1d8e7e8e700706c5d1f2ef72c97614c10aa51580c6f8e9610e5e7752beb6df1f.jpg)  

no person may operate an aircraft beneath the ceiling under  VFR within the lateral boundaries of controlled airspace  designated to the surface for an airport when the ceiling is  less than 1,000 feet. Additional information can be found in  14 CFR part 91, section 91.155(c).  

# Operating Rules and Pilot/Equipment Requirements  

The safety of flight is a top priority of all pilots and the  responsibilities associated with operating an aircraft  should always be taken seriously. The air traffic system  maintains a high degree of safety and efficiency with strict  regulatory oversight of the FAA. Pilots fly in accordance  with regulations that have served the United States well, as  evidenced by the fact that the country has the safest aviation  system in the world.  

All aircraft operating in today’s National Airspace System  (NAS) has complied with the CFR governing its certification  and maintenance; all pilots operating today have completed  rigorous pilot certification training and testing. Of equal  importance is the proper execution of preflight planning,  aeronautical decision-making (ADM) and risk management.  ADM involves a systematic approach to risk assessment  and stress management in aviation, illustrates how personal  attitudes can influence decision-making, and how those  attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the flight  deck. More detailed information regarding ADM and  risk mitigation can be found in Chapter 2, “Aeronautical  Decision-Making.”  

Pilots also comply with very strict FAA general operating  and flight rules as outlined in the CFR, including the FAA’s  important “see and avoid” mandate. These regulations provide  the historical foundation of the FAA regulations governing  the aviation system and the individual classes of airspace.  Figure 15-9  lists the operational and equipment requirements  for these various classes of airspace. It is helpful to refer to this  figure as the specific classes are discussed in greater detail.  

# Class A  

Pilots operating an aircraft in Class A airspace must conduct  that operation under IFR and only under an ATC clearance  received prior to entering the airspace. Unless otherwise  authorized by ATC, each aircraft operating in Class A  airspace must be equipped with a two-way radio capable of  communicating with ATC on a frequency assigned by ATC.  Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all aircraft within  Class A airspace must be equipped with the appropriate  transponder equipment meeting all applicable specifications  found in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.215. Additionally,  beginning January 1, 2020, aircraft operating in the Class  A airspace described in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.225,  must have ADS-B Out equipment installed, which meets the  performance requirements of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.227.  

Class B  

All pilots operating an aircraft within a Class B airspace area  must receive an ATC clearance from the ATC facility having  jurisdiction for that area. The pilot in command (PIC) may  not take off or land an aircraft at an airport within a Class  B airspace unless he or she has met one of the following  requirements:  

2. 	 A recreational pilot certificate and all requirements  contained within 14 CFR part 61, section 61.101(d), or  the requirements for a student pilot seeking a recreational  pilot certificate in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.94.  

3. 	 A sport pilot certificate and all requirements contained  within 14 CFR part 61, section 61.325, or the  requirements for a student pilot seeking a recreational  pilot certificate in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.94, or  the aircraft is operated by a student pilot who has met  the requirements of 14 CFR part 61, sections 61.94  and 61.95, as applicable.  

Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, all aircraft within Class  B airspace must be equipped with the applicable operating  transponder and automatic altitude reporting equipment  specified in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.215(a) and an  operable two-way radio capable of communications with  ATC on appropriate frequencies for that Class B airspace  area. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, aircraft  operating in the Class B airspace described in 14 CFR part 91,  section 91.225, must have ADS-B Out equipment installed,  which meets the performance requirements of 14 CFR part  91, section 91.227.  

# Class   $C$  

For the purpose of this section, the primary airport is the  airport for which the Class C airspace area is designated. A  satellite airport is any other airport within the Class C airspace  area. No pilot may take off or land an aircraft at a satellite  airport within a Class C airspace area except in compliance  with FAA arrival and departure traffic patterns.  

Two-way radio communications must be established and  maintained with the ATC facility providing air traffic services  

![Figure 15-9.  Requirements for airspace operations. ](images/8ba76a4246b5b6f95adee00219d18274432cac8c29487f5fe71516bb29206b2a.jpg)  

prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintained while  within the airspace.  

A pilot departing from the primary airport or satellite airport  with an operating control tower must establish and maintain  two-way radio communications with the control tower,  and thereafter as instructed by ATC while operating in the  Class C airspace area. If departing from a satellite airport  without an operating control tower, the pilot must establish  and maintain two-way radio communications with the ATC  facility having jurisdiction over the Class C airspace area as  soon as practicable after departing.  

Unless otherwise authorized by the ATC having jurisdiction  over the Class C airspace area, all aircraft within Class C  airspace must be equipped with the appropriate transponder  equipment meeting all applicable specifications found in 14  CFR part 91, section 91.215. Additionally, beginning January  1, 2020, aircraft operating in the Class C airspace described  in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.225, must have ADS-B  Out equipment installed, which meets the performance  requirements of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.227.  

# Class D  

No pilot may take off or land an aircraft at a satellite airport  within a Class D airspace area except in compliance with  FAA arrival and departure traffic patterns. A pilot departing  from the primary airport or satellite airport with an operating  control tower must establish and maintain two-way radio  communications with the control tower, and thereafter as  instructed by ATC while operating in the Class D airspace  area. If departing from a satellite airport without an operating  control tower, the pilot must establish and maintain two- way radio communications with the ATC facility having  jurisdiction over the Class D airspace area as soon as  practicable after departing.  

Two-way radio communications must be established and  maintained with the ATC facility providing air traffic services  prior to entering the airspace and thereafter maintained while  within the airspace.  

If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot should  continue the flight by the route assigned in the last ATC  clearance received; or, if being radar vectored, by the direct  route from the point of radio failure to the fix, route, or  airway specified in the vector clearance. In the absence of  an assigned route, the pilot should continue by the route  that ATC advised may be expected in a further clearance;  or, if a route had not been advised, by the route filed in the  flight plan.  

If the aircraft radio fails in flight under VFR, the PIC may  operate that aircraft and land if weather conditions are at or  above basic VFR weather minimums, visual contact with  the tower is maintained, and a clearance to land is received.  

# Class  $E$  

Unless otherwise required by 14 CFR part 93 or unless  otherwise authorized or required by the ATC facility having  jurisdiction over the Class E airspace area, each pilot  operating an aircraft on or in the vicinity of an airport in a  Class E airspace area must comply with the requirements  of Class G airspace. Each pilot must also comply with any  traffic patterns established for that airport in 14 CFR part 93.  

Unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC, no person  may operate an aircraft to, from, through, or on an airport  having an operational control tower unless two-way radio  communications are maintained between that aircraft and the  control tower. Communications must be established within  four nautical miles from the airport, up to and including 2,500  feet AGL. However, if the aircraft radio fails in flight, the PIC  may operate that aircraft and land if weather conditions are at  or above basic VFR weather minimums, visual contact with  the tower is maintained, and a clearance to land is received.  

If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot should  continue the flight by the route assigned in the last ATC  clearance received; or, if being radar vectored, by the direct  route from the point of radio failure to the fix, route, or  airway specified in the vector clearance. In the absence of  an assigned route, the pilot should continue by the route  that ATC advised may be expected in a further clearance;  or, if a route had not been advised, by the route filed in the  flight plan. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, aircraft  operating in the Class E airspace described in 14 CFR part 91,  section 91.225, must have ADS-B Out equipment installed,  which meets the performance requirements of 14 CFR part  91, section 91.227.  

# Class   $G$  

When approaching to land at an airport without an operating  control tower in Class G airspace:  

1. 	 Each pilot of an airplane must make all turns of that  airplane to the left unless the airport displays approved  light signals or visual markings indicating that turns  should be made to the right, in which case the pilot  must make all turns to the right. 2. 	 Each pilot of a helicopter or a powered parachute must  avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft.  

Unless otherwise authorized or required by ATC, no person  may operate an aircraft to, from, through, or on an airport  having an operational control tower unless two-way radio  communications are maintained between that aircraft and the  control tower. Communications must be established within  four nautical miles from the airport, up to and including 2,500  feet AGL. However, if the aircraft radio fails in flight, the PIC  may operate that aircraft and land if weather conditions are at  or above basic VFR weather minimums, visual contact with  the tower is maintained, and a clearance to land is received.  

If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot should  continue the flight by the route assigned in the last ATC  clearance received; or, if being radar vectored, by the direct  route from the point of radio failure to the fix, route, or airway  specified in the vector clearance. In the absence of an assigned  route, the pilot should continue by the route that ATC advised  may be expected in a further clearance; or, if a route had not  been advised, by the route filed in the flight plan.  

Uncontrolled Airspace  

It is possible for some airports within Class G airspace to  have a control tower (Lake City, FL, for example). Be sure to  check the Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility  Directory) to be familiar with the airport and associated  airspace prior to flight.  

# Unmanned Free Balloons  

Unless otherwise authorized by ATC, no person may operate  an unmanned free balloon below 2,000 feet above the surface  within the lateral boundaries of Class B, Class C, Class D,  or Class E airspace designated for an airport. (See 14 CFR  part  101.)  

# Unmanned Aircraft Systems  

Regulations regarding unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are  currently being developed and are expected to be published  by summer 2016 as 14 CFR part 107.  

# Parachute Jumps  

No person may make a parachute jump, and no PIC may  allow a parachute jump to be made from an aircraft, in or  into Class A, Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace without,  or in violation of, the terms of an ATC authorization issued  by the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the airspace.  (See 14 CFR part 105.)  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter introduces the various classifications of airspace  and provides information on the requirements to operate in  such airspace. For further information, consult the AIM and  14 CFR parts 71, 73, and 91.  

# Ultralight Vehicles  

No person may operate an ultralight vehicle within Class A,  Class B, Class C, or Class D airspace or within the lateral  boundaries of the surface area of Class E airspace designated  for an airport unless that person has prior authorization from  the ATC facility having jurisdiction over that airspace. (See  14 CFR part 103.)  

# Chapter 16 Navigation  

# Introduction  

This chapter provides an introduction to cross-country  flying under visual flight rules (VFR). It contains practical  information for planning and executing cross-country flights  for the beginning pilot.  

Air navigation is the process of piloting an aircraft from  one geographic position to another while monitoring one’s  position as the flight progresses. It introduces the need for  planning, which includes plotting the course on an aeronautical  chart, selecting checkpoints, measuring distances, obtaining  pertinent weather information, and computing flight time,  headings, and fuel requirements. The methods used in this  chapter include pilotage—navigating by reference to visible  landmarks, dead reckoning—computations of direction and  distance from a known position, and radio navigation—by  use of radio aids.  

# Aeronautical Charts  

An aeronautical chart is the road map for a pilot flying under  VFR. The chart provides information that allows pilots to track  their position and provides available information that enhances  safety. The three aeronautical charts used by VFR pilots are:  

•	 Sectional  •	VFR Terminal Area •	 World Aeronautical  

A free catalog listing aeronautical charts and related  publications including prices and instructions for ordering is  available at the Aeronautical Navigation Products website:  www.aeronav.faa.gov.  

# Sectional Charts  

Sectional charts are the most common charts used by pilots  today. The charts have a scale of 1:500,000 (1 inch  $=6.86$  nautical miles (NM) or approximately 8 statute miles (SM)),  which allows for more detailed information to be included  on the chart.  

The charts provide an abundance of information, including  airport data, navigational aids, airspace, and topography.  Figure 16-1  is an excerpt from the legend of a sectional  chart. By referring to the chart legend, a pilot can interpret  most of the information on the chart. A pilot should also  check the chart for other legend information, which includes  air traffic control (ATC) frequencies and information on  airspace. These charts are revised semiannually except for  some areas outside the conterminous United States where  they are revised annually.  

# VFR Terminal Area Charts  

VFR terminal area charts are helpful when flying in or near  Class B airspace. They have a scale of 1:250,000 (1 inch   $=3.43$   NM or approximately 4 SM). These charts provide  a more detailed display of topographical information and  are revised semiannually, except for several Alaskan and  Caribbean charts.  [Figure 16-2]  

# World Aeronautical Charts  

World aeronautical charts are designed to provide a standard  series of aeronautical charts, covering land areas of the world,  

![](images/d3bab877bd42299ce7bc4113a66f24ea666b1b942fda5432d622b87384b40f7d.jpg)

at a size and scale convenient for navigation by moderate speed  aircraft. They are produced at a scale of 1:1,000,000 (1 inch  $=$   $13.7\,\mathrm{NM}$   or approximately 16 SM). These charts are similar to  sectional charts, and the symbols are the same except there is  less detail due to the smaller scale.  [Figure 16-3]  These charts  are revised annually except several Alaskan charts and the  Mexican/Caribbean charts, which are revised every 2 years.  

# Latitude and Longitude (Meridians and  Parallels)  

The equator is an imaginary circle equidistant from the poles  of the Earth. Circles parallel to the equator (lines running east  and west) are parallels of latitude. They are used to measure  degrees of latitude north (N) or south (S) of the equator. The  angular distance from the equator to the pole is one-fourth  of a circle or   $90°$  . The 48 conterminous states of the United  States are located between  $25^{\circ}$   and  $49^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$   latitude. The arrows  in  Figure 16-4  labeled “Latitude” point to lines of latitude. Meridians of longitude are drawn from the North Pole to the  South Pole and are at right angles to the Equator. The “Prime  Meridian,” which passes through Greenwich, England, is  used as the zero line from which measurements are made in  degrees east (E) and west (W) to   $180^{\circ}$  . The 48 conterminous  states of the United States are between   $67^{\circ}$   and   $125^{\circ}$   W  longitude. The arrows in  Figure 16-4  labeled “Longitude”  point to lines of longitude.  

Any specific geographical point can be located by reference  to its longitude and latitude. Washington, D.C., for example,  is approximately  $39^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$   latitude,  $77^{\circ}$   W longitude. Chicago  is approximately  $42^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$   latitude,  $88^{\circ}$   W longitude.  

# Time Zones  

The meridians are also useful for designating time zones. A  day is defined as the time required for the Earth to make one  complete rotation of   $360^{\circ}$  . Since the day is divided into 24  hours, the Earth revolves at the rate of  $15^{\circ}$   an hour. Noon is  the time when the sun is directly above a meridian; to the  west of that meridian is morning, to the east is afternoon.  

![](images/d32c49974871cb93e063b741140929f71652e41297ab44b3f5aeeb3fabb1b12b.jpg)  
Figure 16-3.   World aeronautical chart.  

![](images/cd3ec2083a24eed84b113e78384bbd382445d7ff4a7b72c419bf6eb781a293d7.jpg)  
Figure 16-4.   Meridians and parallels—the basis of measuring time,  distance, and direction.  

The standard practice is to establish a time zone for each   $15^{\circ}$   of longitude. This makes a difference of exactly 1 hour  between each zone. In the conterminous United States,  there are four time zones. The time zones are Eastern   $(75^{\circ})$  ,  Central   $(90^{\circ})$  , Mountain   $(105^{\circ})$  , and Pacific   $(120^{\circ})$  . The  dividing lines are somewhat irregular because communities  near the boundaries often find it more convenient to use time  designations of neighboring communities or trade centers.  

Figure 16-5  shows the time zones in the conterminous United  States. When the sun is directly above the 90th meridian, it  is noon Central Standard Time. At the same time, it is  $1\,\mathrm{p.m}$  .  Eastern Standard Time, 11 a.m. Mountain Standard Time,  and   $10\;\mathrm{a.m}$  . Pacific Standard Time. When Daylight Saving  Time is in effect, generally between the second Sunday in  March and the first Sunday in November, the sun is directly  above the 75th meridian at noon, Central Daylight Time.  

These time zone differences must be taken into account  during long flights eastward—especially if the flight must  be completed before dark. Remember, an hour is lost when  

![](images/e60d932ca0216981993d52a63c69f0fd214e55915b5333673527854d912d44c3.jpg)  
Figure 16-5.   Time zones in the conterminous United States.  

flying eastward from one time zone to another, or perhaps  even when flying from the western edge to the eastern edge  of the same time zone. Determine the time of sunset at the  destination by consulting the flight service station (FSS) and  take this into account when planning an eastbound flight.  

In most aviation operations, time is expressed in terms of  the 24-hour clock. ATC instructions, weather reports and  broadcasts, and estimated times of arrival are all based on  this system. For example: 9 a.m. is expressed as  $0900,1\,\mathrm{p.m}$  .  is 1300, and   $10\,\mathrm{p.m}$  . is 2200.  

Because a pilot may cross several time zones during a flight, a  standard time system has been adopted. It is called Universal  Coordinated Time (UTC) and is often referred to as Zulu  time. UTC is the time at the  $0^{\circ}$   line of longitude which passes  through Greenwich, England. All of the time zones around  the world are based on this reference. To convert to this time,  a pilot should do the following:  

Eastern Standard Time...........Add 5 hours Central Standard Time...........Add 6 hours Mountain Standard Time.......Add 7 hours Pacific Standard Time............Add 8 hours  

For Daylight Saving Time, 1 hour should be subtracted from  the calculated times.  

# Measurement of Direction  

By using the meridians, direction from one point to another  can be measured in degrees, in a clockwise direction from  true north. To indicate a course to be followed in flight,  draw a line on the chart from the point of departure to the  destination and measure the angle that this line forms with  a meridian. Direction is expressed in degrees, as shown by  the compass rose in  Figure 16-6.  

Because meridians converge toward the poles, course  measurement should be taken at a meridian near the midpoint  of the course rather than at the point of departure. The course  measured on the chart is known as the true course (TC). This  is the direction measured by reference to a meridian or true  north (TN). It is the direction of intended flight as measured  in degrees clockwise from TN.  

As shown in  Figure 16-7,  the direction from A to B would be  a TC of  $065^{\circ}$  , whereas the return trip (called the reciprocal)  would be a TC of  $245^{\circ}$  .  

![](images/488cc8f1b7ff49a12fc28c59608095bf4371eacbad3c40252c2fff8ced345694.jpg)  
Figure 16-6.   Compass rose.  

The true heading (TH) is the direction in which the nose of  the aircraft points during a flight when measured in degrees  clockwise from TN. Usually, it is necessary to head the  aircraft in a direction slightly different from the TC to offset  the effect of wind. Consequently, numerical value of the TH  may not correspond with that of the TC. This is discussed  more fully in subsequent sections in this chapter. For the  purpose of this discussion, assume a no-wind condition exists  under which heading and course would coincide. Thus, for  a TC of  $065^{\circ}$  , the TH would be  $065^{\circ}$  . To use the compass  accurately, however, corrections must be made for magnetic  variation and compass deviation.  

# Variation  

Variation is the angle between TN and magnetic north (MN).  It is expressed as east variation or west variation depending  upon whether MN is to the east or west of TN.  

![](images/521b091e10ad0b21132bfdccfc313ef714cffdbc94205a9e61dfba1df4a5ad04.jpg)  
Figure 16-7.   Courses are determined by reference to meridians on  aeronautical charts.  

The north magnetic pole is located close to  $71^{\circ}\,\mathrm{N}$   latitude,  $96^{\circ}$  W longitude and is about 1,300 miles from the geographic  or true north pole, as indicated in  Figure 16-8.  If the Earth  were uniformly magnetized, the compass needle would point  toward the magnetic pole, in which case the variation between  TN (as shown by the geographical meridians) and MN (as  shown by the magnetic meridians) could be measured at any  intersection of the meridians.  

Actually, the Earth is not uniformly magnetized. In the United  States, the needle usually points in the general direction of  the magnetic pole, but it may vary in certain geographical  localities by many degrees. Consequently, the exact amount  of variation at thousands of selected locations in the United  States has been carefully determined. The amount and the  direction of variation, which change slightly from time  to time, are shown on most aeronautical charts as broken  magenta lines called isogonic lines that connect points of  equal magnetic variation. (The line connecting points at  which there is no variation between TN and MN is the agonic  line.) An isogonic chart is shown in  Figure 16-9 . Minor  bends and turns in the isogonic and agonic lines are caused  by unusual geological conditions affecting magnetic forces  in these areas.  

On the west coast of the United States, the compass needle  points to the east of TN; on the east coast, the compass needle  points to the west of TN.

Figure 16-8.   Magnetic meridians are in red while the lines of  longitude and latitude are in blue. From these lines of variation  (magnetic meridians), one can determine the effect of local magnetic  variations on a magnetic compass.

Figure 16-9.   Note the agonic line where magnetic variation is zero.  

Zero degree variation exists on the agonic line where  MN and TN coincide. This line runs roughly west of the  Great Lakes, south through Wisconsin, Illinois, western  Tennessee, and along the border of Mississippi and Alabama.  Compare  Figures 16-9  and  16-10.  

Because courses are measured in reference to geographical  meridians that point toward TN, and these courses are  maintained by reference to the compass that points along a  magnetic meridian in the general direction of MN, the true  direction must be converted into magnetic direction for the  purpose of flight. This conversion is made by adding or  subtracting the variation indicated by the nearest isogonic  line on the chart.  

For example, a line drawn between two points on a chart  is called a TC as it is measured from TN. However, flying  this course off the magnetic compass would not provide an  accurate course between the two points due to three elements  that must be considered. The first is magnetic variation, the  second is compass deviation, and the third is wind correction.  All three must be considered for accurate navigation.  

# Magnetic Variation  

As mentioned in the paragraph discussing variation, the  appropriate variation for the geographical location of  the flight must be considered and added or subtracted as  appropriate. If flying across an area where the variation  changes, then the values must be applied along the route of  flight appropriately. Once applied, this new course is called  the magnetic course.  

# Magnetic Deviation  

Because each aircraft has its own internal effect upon the  onboard compass systems from its own localized magnetic  influencers, the pilot must add or subtract these influencers  based upon the direction he or she is flying. The application of  deviation (taken from a compass deviation card) compensates  the magnetic course unique to that aircraft’s compass system  (as affected by localized magnetic influencers) and it now  becomes the compass course. Therefore, the compass course,  when followed (in a no wind condition), takes the aircraft  from point A to point B even though the aircraft heading  may not match the original course line drawn on the chart.  

If the variation is shown as   ${}^{\bullet}9^{\circ}\mathrm{~E~}$  ,” this means that MN is   $9^{\circ}$   east of TN. If a TC of   $360^{\circ}$   is to be flown,   $9^{\circ}$   must be  subtracted from   $360^{\circ}$  , which results in a magnetic heading  of   $351^{\circ}$  . To fly east, a magnetic course of   $081^{\circ}\left(090^{\circ}-9^{\circ}\right)$    would be flown. To fly south, the magnetic course would be   $171^{\circ}\,(180^{\circ}-9^{\circ})$  . To fly west, it would be  $261^{\circ}$     $(270^{\circ}-9^{\circ})$  .  To fly a TH of   $060^{\circ}$  , a magnetic course of  $151^{\circ}\left(060^{\circ}-9^{\circ}\right)$    would be flown.

Figure 16-10.   Effect of variation on the compass.  

Remember, if variation is west, add; if east, subtract. One  method for remembering whether to add or subtract variation  is the phrase “east is least (subtract) and west is best (add).”  

# Deviation  

Determining the magnetic heading is an intermediate step  necessary to obtain the correct compass heading for the flight.  To determine compass heading, a correction for deviation  must be made. Because of magnetic influences within an  aircraft, such as electrical circuits, radio, lights, tools, engine,  and magnetized metal parts, the compass needle is frequently  deflected from its normal reading. This deflection is called  deviation. The deviation is different for each aircraft, and  it also may vary for different headings in the same aircraft.  For instance, if magnetism in the engine attracts the north  end of the compass, there would be no effect when the plane  is on a heading of MN. On easterly or westerly headings,  however, the compass indications would be in error, as shown  in  Figure 16-11 . Magnetic attraction can come from many  other parts of the aircraft; the assumption of attraction in the  engine is merely used for the purpose of illustration.  

Some adjustment of the compass, referred to as compensation,  can be made to reduce this error, but the remaining correction  must be applied by the pilot.  

Proper compensation of the compass is best performed by  a competent technician. Since the magnetic forces within  the aircraft change because of landing shocks, vibration,  mechanical work, or changes in equipment, the pilot should  occasionally have the deviation of the compass checked. The  procedure used to check the deviation is called “swinging the  compass” and is briefly outlined as follows.  

![](images/d979b138625b060b0662e711e097695c69f53e2c020bc3353a0f5eab07348502.jpg)  
Figure 16-11.   Magnetized portions of the airplane cause the  compass to deviate from its normal indications.  

The aircraft is placed on a magnetic compass rose, the engine  started, and electrical devices normally used (such as radio)  are turned on. Tailwheel-type aircraft should be jacked up into  flying position. The aircraft is aligned with MN indicated on  the compass rose and the reading shown on the compass is  recorded on a deviation card. The aircraft is then aligned at   $30^{\circ}$   intervals and each reading is recorded. If the aircraft is to  be flown at night, the lights are turned on and any significant  changes in the readings are noted. If so, additional entries  are made for use at night. The accuracy of the compass can  also be checked by comparing the compass reading with the  known runway headings.  

A deviation card, similar to  Figure 16-12,  is mounted near  the compass showing the addition or subtraction required to  correct for deviation on various headings, usually at intervals  of  $30^{\circ}$  . For intermediate readings, the pilot should be able to  interpolate mentally with sufficient accuracy. For example,  if the pilot needed the correction for   $195^{\circ}$   and noted the  correction for   $180^{\circ}$   to be  $0^{\circ}$   and for  $210^{\circ}$   to be  $+2^{\circ}$  , it could  be assumed that the correction for   $195^{\circ}$   would be  $+1^{\circ}$  . The  magnetic heading, when corrected for deviation, is known  as compass heading.  

# Effect of Wind  

The preceding discussion explained how to measure a TC  on the aeronautical chart and how to make corrections for  variation and deviation, but one important factor has not  been considered—wind. As discussed in the study of the  atmosphere, wind is a mass of air moving over the surface of  the Earth in a definite direction. When the wind is blowing  from the north at 25 knots, it simply means that air is moving  southward over the Earth’s surface at the rate of   $25~\mathrm{{NM}}$   in  1 hour.  

Under these conditions, any inert object free from contact  with the Earth is carried   $25~\mathrm{{NM}}$   southward in 1 hour. This  effect becomes apparent when such things as clouds, dust,  and toy balloons are observed being blown along by the wind.  Obviously, an aircraft flying within the moving mass of air  is similarly affected. Even though the aircraft does not float  freely with the wind, it moves through the air at the same  time the air is moving over the ground, and thus is affected  by wind. Consequently, at the end of 1 hour of flight, the  aircraft is in a position that results from a combination of  the following two motions:  

![Figure 16-12.   Compass deviation card. ](images/ca3dd4875d91bbf3f01d26612ee2073711b268f598d99a2a97bd7cfe68948e4d.jpg)  

•	 Movement of the air mass in reference to the ground •	 Forward movement of the aircraft through the air mass  

Actually, these two motions are independent. It makes no  difference whether the mass of air through which the aircraft  is flying is moving or is stationary. A pilot flying in a 70-  knot gale would be totally unaware of any wind (except for  possible turbulence) unless the ground were observed. In  reference to the ground, however, the aircraft would appear  to fly faster with a tailwind or slower with a headwind, or to  drift right or left with a crosswind.  

As shown in  Figure 16-13,  an aircraft flying eastward at  an airspeed of 120 knots in still air has a groundspeed (GS)  exactly the same—120 knots. If the mass of air is moving  eastward at 20 knots, the airspeed of the aircraft is not  affected, but the progress of the aircraft over the ground is  120 plus 20 or a GS of 140 knots. On the other hand, if the  

![](images/b690c9328d3628d232c740331521f77e238dc45158e83b4023041d1ddd25e383.jpg)  
Figure 16-13.   Motion of the air affects the speed with which aircraft  move over the Earth’s surface. Airspeed, the rate at which an  aircraft moves through the air, is not affected by air motion.  

mass of air is moving westward at 20 knots, the airspeed of  the aircraft remains the same, but GS becomes 120 minus  20 or 100 knots.  

Assuming no correction is made for wind effect, if an aircraft  is heading eastward at 120 knots and the air mass moving  southward at 20 knots, the aircraft at the end of 1 hour is  almost 120 miles east of its point of departure because of its  progress through the air. It is 20 miles south because of the  motion of the air. Under these circumstances, the airspeed  remains 120 knots, but the GS is determined by combining  the movement of the aircraft with that of the air mass. GS can  be measured as the distance from the point of departure to  the position of the aircraft at the end of 1 hour. The GS can  be computed by the time required to fly between two points a  known distance apart. It also can be determined before flight  by constructing a wind triangle, which is explained later in  this chapter.  [Figure 16-14]  

The direction in which the aircraft is pointing as it flies is  called heading. Its actual path over the ground, which is a  combination of the motion of the aircraft and the motion of  the air, is called track. The angle between the heading and  the track is called drift angle. If the aircraft heading coincides  with the TC and the wind is blowing from the left, the track  does not coincide with the TC. The wind causes the aircraft  to drift to the right, so the track falls to the right of the desired  course or TC.  [Figure 16-15]  

The following method is used by many pilots to determine  compass heading: after the TC is measured, and wind  correction applied resulting in a TH, the sequence   $\mathrm{TH}\ \pm$  variation   $\mathrm{(V)=}$  magnetic heading (MH)  $\pm$  deviation (D)   $=$  compass heading (CH) is followed to arrive at compass  heading.  [Figure 16-16]  

By determining the amount of drift, the pilot can counteract  the effect of the wind and make the track of the aircraft  coincide with the desired course. If the mass of air is moving  across the course from the left, the aircraft drifts to the  right, and a correction must be made by heading the aircraft  sufficiently to the left to offset this drift. In other words, if  the wind is from the left, the correction is made by pointing  the aircraft to the left a certain number of degrees, therefore  correcting for wind drift. This is the wind correction angle  (WCA) and is expressed in terms of degrees right or left of  the TC.  [Figure 16-17]

To summarize:  

•	 Course—intended path of an aircraft over the ground  or the direction of a line drawn on a chart representing  the intended aircraft path, expressed as the angle  measured from a specific reference datum clockwise  from  $0^{\circ}$   through   $360^{\circ}$   to the line.  •	 Heading—direction in which the nose of the aircraft  points during flight. •	 Track—actual path made over the ground in flight. (If  proper correction has been made for the wind, track  and course are identical.)  •	 Drift angle—angle between heading and track. •	 WCA—correction applied to the course to establish  a heading so that track coincides with course.  •	 Airspeed—rate of the aircraft’s progress through  the air. •	 GS—rate of the aircraft’s inflight progress over  the ground.

# Basic Calculations  

Before a cross-country flight, a pilot should make common  calculations for time, speed, and distance, and the amount  of fuel required.  

# Converting Minutes to Equivalent Hours  

Frequently, it is necessary to convert minutes into equivalent  hours when solving speed, time, and distance problems. To  convert minutes to hours, divide by 60 (60 minutes  $=1$   hour).  Thus, 30 minutes is   $30/60=0.5\$   hour. To convert hours to  minutes, multiply by 60. Thus, 0.75 hour equals   $0.75\,\times\,60$   $=45$   minutes.  

# Time  $\scriptstyle{T\;=\;D/G S}$  

To find the time (T) in flight, divide the distance (D) by the  GS. The time to fly   $210\;\mathrm{{NM}}$   at a GS of 140 knots is  $210\div$  140 or 1.5 hours. (The 0.5 hour multiplied by 60 minutes  equals 30 minutes.) Answer: 1:30.  

# Distance  $D=G S\,X\,T$  

To find the distance flown in a given time, multiply GS by  time. The distance flown in 1 hour 45 minutes at a GS of 120  knots is   $120\times1.75$   or  $210\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  .  

#  ${\cal G S}\,{\cal G S}={\cal D}/T$  

To find the GS, divide the distance flown by the time  required. If an aircraft flies   $270~\mathrm{{NM}}$   in 3 hours, the GS is   $270\div3=90$   knots.  

# Converting Knots to Miles Per Hour  

Another conversion is that of changing knots to miles per hour  (mph). The aviation industry is using knots more frequently  than mph, but is important to understand the conversion for  those that use mph when working with speed problems. The  NWS reports both surface winds and winds aloft in knots.  However, airspeed indicators in some aircraft are calibrated  in mph (although many are now calibrated in both mph and  knots). Pilots, therefore, should learn to convert wind speeds  that are reported in knots to mph.  

A knot is 1 nautical mile per hour (NMPH). Because there are  6,076.1 feet in 1 NM and 5,280 feet in 1 SM, the conversion  factor is 1.15. To convert knots to mph, multiply speed in  knots by 1.15. For example: a wind speed of 20 knots is  equivalent to  $23\;\mathrm{mph}$  .  

Most flight computers or electronic calculators have a  means of making this conversion. Another quick method of  conversion is to use the scales of NM and SM at the bottom  of aeronautical charts.  

# Fuel Consumption  

To ensure that sufficient fuel is available for your intended  flight, you must be able to accurately compute aircraft fuel  consumption during preflight planning. Typically, fuel  consumption in gasoline-fueled aircraft is measured in  gallons per hour. Since turbine engines consume much more  fuel than reciprocating engines, turbine-powered aircraft  require much more fuel, and thus much larger fuel tanks.  When determining these large fuel quantities, using a volume  measurement such as gallons presents a problem because  the volume of fuel varies greatly in relation to temperature.  In contrast, density (weight) is less affected by temperature  and therefore, provides a more uniform and repeatable  measurement. For this reason, jet fuel is generally quantified  by its density and volume.  

This standard industry convention yields a pounds-of-fuel- per-hour value which, when divided into the nautical miles  (NM) per hour of travel   $\mathrm{TAS\pm}$   winds) value, results in a  specific range value. The typical label for specific range is  NM per pound of fuel, or often NM per 1,000 pounds of fuel. Preflight planning should be supported by proper monitoring  of past fuel consumption as well as use of specified fuel  management and mixture adjustment procedures in flight.  

For simple aircraft with reciprocating engines, the Aircraft  Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook (AFM/POH)  supplied by the aircraft manufacturer provides gallons-per- hour values to assist with preflight planning.  

When planning a flight, you must determine how much  fuel is needed to reach your destination by calculating the  distance the aircraft can travel (with winds considered) at  a known rate of fuel consumption (gal/hr or lbs/hr) for the  expected groundspeed (GS) and ensure this amount, plus an  adequate reserve, is available on board.  GS determines the  time the flight will take.  The amount of fuel needed for a  given flight can be calculated by multiplying the estimated  flight time by the rate of consumption.  For example, a flight  of  $400\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   at 100 knots GS takes 4 hours to complete.  If an  aircraft consumes 5 gallons of fuel per hour, the total fuel  consumption is 20 gallons (4 hours times 5 gallons).  In this  example, there is no wind; therefore, true airspeed (TAS)  is also 100 knots, the same as GS.  Since the rate of fuel  consumption remains relatively constant at a given TAS,  you must use GS to calculate fuel consumption when wind  is present. Specific range (NM/lb or   $\mathrm{{NM}/\mathrm{{Gal}}}$  ) is also useful  in calculating fuel consumption when wind is a factor.  

You should always plan to be on the surface before any of  the following occur:  

•	 Your flight time exceeds the amount of flight time  you calculated for the consumption of your preflight  fuel amount •	 Your fuel gauge indicates low fuel level  

The rate of fuel consumption depends on many factors:  condition of the engine, propeller/rotor pitch, propeller/ rotor revolutions per minute (rpm), richness of the mixture,  and the percentage of horsepower used for flight at cruising  speed. The pilot should know the approximate consumption  rate from cruise performance charts or from experience.  In addition to the amount of fuel required for the flight,  there should be sufficient fuel for reserve. When estimating  consumption you must plan for cruise flight as well as startup  and taxi, and higher fuel burn during climb. Remember that  ground speed during climb is less than during cruise flight  at the same airspeed. Additional fuel for adequate reserve  should also be added as a safety measure.  

# Flight Computers  

Up to this point, only mathematical formulas have been used  to determine such items as time, distance, speed, and fuel  consumption. In reality, most pilots use a mechanical flight  computer called an E6B or electronic flight calculator. These  devices can compute numerous problems associated with  flight planning and navigation. The mechanical or electronic  computer has an instruction book that probably includes  sample problems so the pilot can become familiar with its  functions and operation.  [Figure 16-18]  

# Plotter  

Another aid in flight planning is a plotter, which is a protractor  and ruler. The pilot can use this when determining TC and  measuring distance. Most plotters have a ruler that measures  in both NM and SM and has a scale for a sectional chart on one  side and a world aeronautical chart on the other.  [Figure 16-18]  

# Pilotage  

Pilotage is navigation by reference to landmarks or  checkpoints. It is a method of navigation that can be used  on any course that has adequate checkpoints, but it is more  commonly used in conjunction with dead reckoning and  VFR radio navigation.  

The checkpoints selected should be prominent features  common to the area of the flight. Choose checkpoints that can  be readily identified by other features, such as roads, rivers,  railroad tracks, lakes, and power lines. If possible, select  features that make useful boundaries or brackets on each  side of the course, such as highways, rivers, railroads, and  mountains. A pilot can keep from drifting too far off course  by referring to and not crossing the selected brackets. Never  place complete reliance on any single checkpoint. Choose  ample checkpoints. If one is missed, look for the next one while  maintaining the heading. When determining position from  checkpoints, remember that the scale of a sectional chart is 1  inch  $=\!8$   SM or 6.86 NM. For example, if a checkpoint selected  was approximately one-half inch from the course line on the  chart, it is 4 SM or   $3.43\;\mathrm{{NM}}$   from the course on the ground.  In the more congested areas, some of the smaller features are  not included on the chart. If confused, hold the heading. If a  turn is made away from the heading, it is easy to become lost.  

Roads shown on the chart are primarily the well-traveled  roads or those most apparent when viewed from the air.  New roads and structures are constantly being built and  may not be shown on the chart until the next chart is issued.  Some structures, such as antennas, may be difficult to see.  Sometimes TV antennas are grouped together in an area near  a town. They are supported by almost invisible guy wires.  Never approach an area of antennas less than 500 feet above  the tallest one. Most of the taller structures are marked with  strobe lights to make them more visible to pilots. However,  some weather conditions or background lighting may make  them difficult to see. Aeronautical charts display the best  information available at the time of printing, but a pilot should  be cautious for new structures or changes that have occurred  since the chart was printed.

# Dead Reckoning  

Dead reckoning is navigation solely by means of computations  based on time, airspeed, distance, and direction. The products  derived from these variables, when adjusted by wind speed  and velocity, are heading and GS. The predicted heading  takes the aircraft along the intended path and the GS  establishes the time to arrive at each checkpoint and the  destination. Except for flights over water, dead reckoning  is usually used with pilotage for cross-country flying. The  heading and GS, as calculated, is constantly monitored and  corrected by pilotage as observed from checkpoints.  

# Wind Triangle or Vector Analysis  

If there is no wind, the aircraft’s ground track is the same as  the heading and the GS is the same as the true airspeed. This  condition rarely exists. A wind triangle, the pilot’s version  of vector analysis, is the basis of dead reckoning.  

The wind triangle is a graphic explanation of the effect of  wind upon flight. GS, heading, and time for any flight can be  determined by using the wind triangle. It can be applied to  the simplest kind of cross-country flight, as well as the most  complicated instrument flight. The experienced pilot becomes  so familiar with the fundamental principles that estimates can  be made that are adequate for visual flight without actually  drawing the diagrams. The beginning student, however, needs  to develop skill in constructing these diagrams as an aid to the  complete understanding of wind effect. Either consciously or  unconsciously, every good pilot thinks of the flight in terms  of wind triangle.  

If flight is to be made on a course to the east, with a wind  blowing from the northeast, the aircraft must be headed  somewhat to the north of east to counteract drift. This can  be represented by a diagram as shown in  Figure 16-19.  Each  line represents direction and speed. The long blue and white  hashed line shows the direction the aircraft is heading, and  its length represents the distance traveled at the indicated  airspeed for 1 hour. The short blue arrow at the right shows  the wind direction, and its length represents the wind velocity  for 1 hour. The solid yellow line shows the direction of the  track or the path of the aircraft as measured over the earth, and  its length represents the distance traveled in 1 hour or the GS.  

In actual practice, the triangle illustrated in  Figure 16-19  is  not drawn; instead, construct a similar triangle as shown by  the blue, yellow, and black lines in  Figure 16-20,  which is  explained in the following example.  

Suppose a flight is to be flown from E to P. Draw a line on  the aeronautical chart connecting these two points; measure  its direction with a protractor, or plotter, in reference to a  meridian. This is the TC, which in this example is assumed  to be   $090^{\circ}$   (east). From the NWS, it is learned that the wind  at the altitude of the intended flight is 40 knots from the  northeast   $(045^{\circ})$  . Since the NWS reports the wind speed in  knots, if the true airspeed of the aircraft is 120 knots, there is  no need to convert speeds from knots to mph or vice versa.  

Now, on a plain sheet of paper draw a vertical line representing  north to south. (The various steps are shown in  Figure 16-21. )  

# Step 1  

Place the protractor with the base resting on the vertical line  and the curved edge facing east. At the center point of the  base, make a dot labeled “E” (point of departure) and at the  curved edge, make a dot at  $90^{\circ}$   (indicating the direction of the  true course) and another at   $45^{\circ}$   (indicating wind direction).

Figure 16-21.   Steps in drawing the wind triangle.  

# Step 2  

With the ruler, draw the true course line from E, extending it  somewhat beyond the dot by  $90^{\circ}$  , and labeling it “TC  $090^{\circ}$  .”  

# Step 3  

Next, align the ruler with E and the dot at   $45^{\circ}$  , and draw  the wind arrow from E, not toward  $045^{\circ}$  , but downwind in  the direction the wind is blowing making it 40 units long to  correspond with the wind velocity of 40 knots. Identify this  line as the wind line by placing the letter “W” at the end to  show the wind direction.  

# Step 4  

Finally, measure 120 units on the ruler to represent the  airspeed, making a dot on the ruler at this point. The units  used may be of any convenient scale or value (such as  $\%$  inch  $=10$   knots), but once selected, the same scale must  be used for each of the linear movements involved. Then  place the ruler so that the end is on the arrowhead (W) and  the 120-knot dot intercepts the TC line. Draw the line and  label it “AS 120.” The point “P” placed at the intersection  represents the position of the aircraft at the end of 1 hour.  The diagram is now complete.  

The distance flown in 1 hour (GS) is measured as the numbers  of units on the TC line (88 NMPH or 88 knots). The TH  necessary to offset drift is indicated by the direction of the  airspeed line, which can be determined in one of two ways:  

•	 By placing the straight side of the protractor along  the north-south line, with its center point at the  intersection of the airspeed line and north-south line,  read the TH directly in degrees   $(076^{\circ})$  .  [Figure 16-22] •	 By placing the straight side of the protractor along the  TC line, with its center at P, read the angle between  the TC and the airspeed line. This is the WCA, which  must be applied to the TC to obtain the TH. If the wind  blows from the right of TC, the angle is added; if from  the left, it is subtracted. In the example given, the  WCA is   $14^{\circ}$   and the wind is from the left; therefore,  subtract   $14^{\circ}$   from TC of   $090^{\circ}$  , making the TH   $076^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 16-23]  

After obtaining the TH, apply the correction for magnetic  variation to obtain magnetic heading and the correction  for compass deviation to obtain a compass heading. The  compass heading can be used to fly to the destination by  dead reckoning.  

To determine the time and fuel required for the flight, first  find the distance to your destination by measuring the length  of the course line drawn on the aeronautical chart (using the  appropriate scale at the bottom of the chart). If the distance  measures  $220\,\mathrm{{NM}}$  , divide by the GS of 88 knots, which gives  2.5 hours, or 2:30, as the time required. If fuel consumption  is 8 gallons an hour,   $8\,\times\,2.5$   or about 20 gallons is used.

Figure 16-23.   Finding true heading by direct measurement.  

Briefly summarized, the steps in obtaining flight information  are as follows:  

•	 TC—direction of the line connecting two desired  points, drawn on the chart and measured clockwise  in degrees from TN on the mid-meridian •	 WCA—determined from the wind triangle. (Added  to TC if the wind is from the right; subtracted if wind  is from the left) •	 TH—direction measured in degrees clockwise from  TN, in which the nose of the plane should point to  remain on the desired course  

•	 Variation—obtained from the isogonic line on the  chart (added to TH if west; subtracted if east)

 •	 MH—an intermediate step in the conversion (obtained  by applying variation to TH)

 •	 Deviation—obtained from the deviation card on the  aircraft (added to or subtracted from MH, as indicated)

 •	 Compass heading—reading on the compass (found by  applying deviation to MH) that is followed to remain  on the desired course  

•	 Total distance—obtained by measuring the length of  the TC line on the chart (using the scale at the bottom  of the chart) •	 GS—obtained by measuring the length of the TC line  on the wind triangle (using the scale employed for  drawing the diagram) •	 Estimated time en route (ETE)—total distance divided  by GS •	 Fuel rate—predetermined gallons per hour used at  cruising speed  

NOTE: Additional fuel for adequate reserve should be added  as a safety measure.  

# Flight Planning  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part  91 states, in part, that before beginning a flight, the pilot in  command (PIC) of an aircraft shall become familiar with all  available information concerning that flight. For flights not  in the vicinity of an airport, this must include information  on available current weather reports and forecasts, fuel  requirements, alternatives available if the planned flight  cannot be completed, and any known traffic delays of which  the PIC has been advised by ATC.  

# Assembling Necessary Material  

The pilot should collect the necessary material well before  beginning the flight. An appropriate current sectional chart  and charts for areas adjoining the flight route should be among  this material if the route of flight is near the border of a chart.  

Additional equipment should include a flight computer or  electronic calculator, plotter, and any other item appropriate  to the particular flight. For example, if a night flight is to  be undertaken, carry a flashlight; if a flight is over desert  country, carry a supply of water and other necessities.  

# Weather Check  

It is wise to check the weather before continuing with other  aspects of flight planning to see, first of all, if the flight is  feasible and, if it is, which route is best. Chapter 12, “Aviation  Weather Services,” discusses obtaining a weather briefing.  

# Use of Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/ Facility Directory)  

Study available information about each airport at which a  landing is intended. This should include a study of the Notices  to Airmen (NOTAMs) and the Chart Supplement U.S.  (formerly Airport/Facility Directory).  [Figure 16-24]  This  includes location, elevation, runway and lighting facilities,  available services, availability of aeronautical advisory  station frequency (UNICOM), types of fuel available (use to  

![](images/0044a446e31d113bfd9379108d57ed7635e5b053b97ef1b5bb69ad8d7a924bb5.jpg)  
Figure 16-24.   Chart Supplement U.S. (formerly Airport/Facility  Directory).  

decide on refueling stops), FSS located on the airport, control  tower and ground control frequencies, traffic information,  remarks, and other pertinent information. The NOTAMs,  issued every 28 days, should be checked for additional  information on hazardous conditions or changes that have  been made since issuance of the Chart Supplement U.S.  

The sectional chart bulletin subsection should be checked for  major changes that have occurred since the last publication date  of each sectional chart being used. Remember, the chart may  be up to 6 months old. The effective date of the chart appears  at the top of the front of the chart. The Chart Supplement U.S.  generally has the latest information pertaining to such matters  and should be used in preference to the information on the  back of the chart, if there are differences.  

# Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot’s Operating  Handbook (AFM/POH)  

The Aircraft Flight Manual or Pilot’s Operating Handbook  (AFM/POH) should be checked to determine the proper  loading of the aircraft (weight and balance data). The weight  of the usable fuel and drainable oil aboard must be known.  Also, check the weight of the passengers, the weight of all  baggage to be carried, and the empty weight of the aircraft to  be sure that the total weight does not exceed the maximum  allowable weight. The distribution of the load must be known  to tell if the resulting center of gravity (CG) is within limits.  

Be sure to use the latest weight and balance information in  the FAA-approved AFM or other permanent aircraft records,  as appropriate, to obtain empty weight and empty weight  CG information.  

Determine the takeoff and landing distances from the  appropriate charts, based on the calculated load, elevation  of the airport, and temperature; then compare these distances  with the amount of runway available. Remember, the  heavier the load and the higher the elevation, temperature,  or humidity, the longer the takeoff roll and landing roll and  the lower the rate of climb.  

Check the fuel consumption charts to determine the rate of  fuel consumption at the estimated flight altitude and power  settings. Calculate the rate of fuel consumption, and compare  it with the estimated time for the flight so that refueling points  along the route can be included in the plan.  

# Charting the Course  

Once the weather has been checked and some preliminary  planning completed, it is time to chart the course and  determine the data needed to accomplish the flight. The  following sections provide a logical sequence to follow in  charting the course, complete a flight log, and filing a flight  plan. In the following example, a trip is planned based on the  following data and the sectional chart excerpt in  Figure 16-25.  

Route of flight: Chickasha Airport direct to Guthrie Airport  

True airspeed (TAS)........................................115 knots  Winds aloft..........................................  $.360^{\circ}$   at 10 knots  Usable fuel.....................................................38 gallons  Fuel rate...............................................................8 GPH  Deviation..................................................................  $+2^{\circ}$  

# Steps in Charting the Course  

The following is a suggested sequence for arriving at the  pertinent information for the trip. As information is determined,  it may be noted as illustrated in the example of a flight log in  Figure 16-26.  Where calculations are required, the pilot may  use a mathematical formula or a manual or electronic flight  computer. If unfamiliar with the use of a manual or electronic  computer, it would be advantageous to read the operation  manual and work several practice problems at this point.  

First, draw a line from Chickasha Airport (point A) directly  to Guthrie Airport (point F). The course line should begin at  the center of the airport of departure and end at the center of  the destination airport. If the route is direct, the course line  consists of a single straight line. If the route is not direct, it  consists of two or more straight line segments. For example, a  VOR station that is off the direct route, but makes navigating  easier, may be chosen (radio navigation is discussed later in  this chapter).  

Appropriate checkpoints should be selected along the route  and noted in some way. These should be easy-to-locate  points, such as large towns, large lakes and rivers, or  combinations of recognizable points, such as towns with  an airport, towns with a network of highways, and railroads  entering and departing.  

Normally, choose only towns indicated by splashes of yellow  on the chart. Do not choose towns represented by a small  circle—these may turn out to be only a half-dozen houses. (In  isolated areas, however, towns represented by a small circle  can be prominent checkpoints.) For this trip, four checkpoints  have been selected. Checkpoint 1 consists of a tower located  east of the course and can be further identified by the highway  and railroad track, which almost parallels the course at this  point. Checkpoint 2 is the obstruction just to the west of the  course and can be further identified by Will Rogers World  Airport, which is directly to the east. Checkpoint 3 is Wiley  Post Airport, which the aircraft should fly directly over.  Checkpoint 4 is a private, non-surfaced airport to the west of  the course and can be further identified by the railroad track  and highway to the east of the course.  

The course and areas on either side of the planned route  should be checked to determine if there is any type of airspace  with which the pilot should be concerned or which has  special operational requirements. For this trip, it should be  noted that the course passes through a segment of the Class  C airspace surrounding Will Rogers World Airport where the  floor of the airspace is 2,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) and  the ceiling is 5,300 feet MSL (point B). Also, there is Class  D airspace from the surface to 3,800 feet MSL surrounding  Wiley Post Airport (point C) during the time the control  tower is in operation.  

Study the terrain and obstructions along the route. This is  necessary to determine the highest and lowest elevations,  as well as the highest obstruction to be encountered so  an appropriate altitude that conforms to 14 CFR part 91  regulations can be selected. If the flight is to be flown  at an altitude of more than 3,000 feet above the terrain,  conformance to the cruising altitude appropriate to the  direction of flight is required. Check the route for particularly  rugged terrain so it can be avoided. Areas where a takeoff  or landing is made should be carefully checked for tall  obstructions. Television transmitting towers may extend to  altitudes over 1,500 feet above the surrounding terrain. It is  essential that pilots be aware of their presence and location.  For this trip, it should be noted that the tallest obstruction is

![Figure 16-26.   Pilot’s planning sheet and visual flight log. ](images/329f09ba1b2278c3e1688ec758cbd62ce595752daa4634b322797da79966af0e.jpg)  

part of a series of antennas with a height of 2,749 feet MSL  (point D). The highest elevation should be located in the  northeast quadrant and is 2,900 feet MSL (point E).  

Since the wind is no factor and it is desirable and within the  aircraft’s capability to fly above the Class C and  $\mathrm{D}$   airspace  to be encountered, an altitude of 5,500 feet MSL is chosen.  This altitude also gives adequate clearance of all obstructions,  as well as conforms to the 14 CFR part 91 requirement to  fly at an altitude of odd thousand plus 500 feet when on a  magnetic course between 0 and   $179^{\circ}$  .  

Next, the pilot should measure the total distance of the  course, as well as the distance between checkpoints. The total  distance is  $53\;\mathrm{{NM}}$  , and the distance between checkpoints is  as noted on the flight log in  Figure 16-26.  

After determining the distance, the TC should be measured.  If using a plotter, follow the directions on the plotter. The TC  is  $031^{\circ}$  . Once the TH is established, the pilot can determine  the compass heading. This is done by following the formula  given earlier in this chapter.  

The formula is:  

#  $\mathrm{TC}\pm\mathrm{WCA}=\mathrm{TH}\pm\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{MHz}\pm\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{CH}$  

The WCA can be determined by using a manual or electronic  flight computer. Using a wind of   $360^{\circ}$   at 10 knots, it is  determined the WCA is   $3^{\circ}$   left. This is subtracted from the  TC making the   $\mathrm{TH}~28^{\circ}$  . Next, the pilot should locate the  isogonic line closest to the route of the flight to determine  variation.  Figure 16-25  shows the variation to be   $6.30^{\circ}\mathrm{~E~}$  (rounded to  $7^{\circ}\,\mathrm{E}$  ), which means it should be subtracted from  the TH, giving an MH of  $21^{\circ}$  . Next, add  $2^{\circ}$   to the MH for  the deviation correction. This gives the pilot the compass  heading of   $23^{\circ}$  .  

Now, the GS can be determined. This is done using a manual  or electronic calculator. The GS is determined to be 106  knots. Based on this information, the total trip time, as well  as time between checkpoints, and the fuel burned can be  determined. These numbers can be calculated by using a  manual or electronic calculator.  

For this trip, the GS is 106 knots and the total time is 35  minutes (30 minutes plus 5 minutes for climb) with a fuel  burn of 4.7 gallons. Refer to the flight log in  Figure 16-26 for the time between checkpoints.  

As the trip progresses, the pilot can note headings and time  and make adjustments in heading, GS, and time.  

# Filing a VFR Flight Plan  

Filing a flight plan is not required by regulations; however, it  is a good operating practice since the information contained  in the flight plan can be used in search and rescue in the  event of an emergency.  

Flight plans can be filed in the air by radio, but it is best to  file a flight plan by phone just before departing. After takeoff,  contact the FSS by radio and give them the takeoff time so  the flight plan can be activated.  

When a VFR flight plan is filed, it is held by the FSS until  1 hour after the proposed departure time and then canceled  unless: the actual departure time is received; a revised  proposed departure time is received; or at the time of filing,  the FSS is informed that the proposed departure time is  met, but actual time cannot be given because of inadequate  communication. The FSS specialist who accepts the flight  plan does not inform the pilot of this procedure, however.  

Figure 16-27  shows the flight plan form a pilot files with the  FSS. When filing a flight plan by telephone or radio, give  the information in the order of the numbered spaces. This  enables the FSS specialist to copy the information more  efficiently. Most of the fields are either self-explanatory  or non-applicable to the VFR flight plan (such as item 13).  However, some fields may need explanation.  

•	 Item 3 is the aircraft type and special equipment. An  example would be C-150/X, which means the aircraft  has no transponder. A listing of special equipment  codes is found in the Aeronautical Information Manual  (AIM). •	 Item 6 is the proposed departure time in UTC  (indicated by the “Z”).  •	 Item 7 is the cruising altitude. Normally, “VFR” can be  entered in this block since the pilot chooses a cruising  altitude to conform to FAA regulations.  

![](images/7f60367f8239b5b302371649dfd026c93bb0af64238dda15eafa8f13a657cca5.jpg)  
Figure 16-27.   Domestic flight plan form.  

•	 Item 8 is the route of flight. If the flight is to be direct,  enter the word “direct;” if not, enter the actual route to  be followed, such as via certain towns or navigation  aids. •	 Item 10 is the estimated time en route. In the sample  flight plan, 5 minutes was added to the total time to  allow for the climb. •	 Item 12 is the fuel on board in hours and minutes. This  is determined by dividing the total usable fuel aboard  in gallons by the estimated rate of fuel consumption  in gallons.  

Remember, there is every advantage in filing a flight plan;  but do not forget to close the flight plan upon arrival. This  should be done via telephone to avoid radio congestion.  

# Ground-Based Navigation  

Advances in navigational radio receivers installed in aircraft,  the development of aeronautical charts that show the exact  location of ground transmitting stations and their frequencies,  along with refined flight deck instrumentation make it  possible for pilots to navigate with precision to almost any  point desired. Although precision in navigation is obtainable  through the proper use of this equipment, beginning pilots  should use this equipment to supplement navigation by visual  reference to the ground (pilotage). This method provides the  pilot with an effective safeguard against disorientation in the  event of radio malfunction.  

There are three radio navigation systems available for use  for VFR navigation. These are:  

•	 VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) •	 Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB) •	 Global Positioning System (GPS)  

# Very High Frequency (VHF) Omnidirectional  Range (VOR)  

The VOR system is present in three slightly different  navigation aids (NAVAIDs): VOR, VOR/distance measuring  equipment (DME)(discussed in a later section), and  VORTAC. By itself it is known as a VOR, and it provides  magnetic bearing information to and from the station. When  DME is also installed with a VOR, the NAVAID is referred  to as a VOR/DME. When military tactical air navigation  (TACAN) equipment is installed with a VOR, the NAVAID  is known as a VORTAC. DME is always an integral part of  a VORTAC. Regardless of the type of NAVAID utilized  (VOR, VOR/DME, or VORTAC), the VOR indicator  behaves the same. Unless otherwise noted in this section,  VOR, VOR/DME, and VORTAC NAVAIDs are all referred  to hereafter as VORs.  

The prefix “omni-” means all, and an omnidirectional range  is a VHF radio transmitting ground station that projects  straight line courses (radials) from the station in all directions.  From a top view, it can be visualized as being similar to the  spokes from the hub of a wheel. The distance VOR radials are  projected depends upon the power output of the transmitter.  

The course or radials projected from the station are referenced  to MN. Therefore, a radial is defined as a line of magnetic  bearing extending outward from the VOR station. Radials are  identified by numbers beginning with 001, which is  $1^{\circ}$   east  of MN and progress in sequence through all the degrees of a  circle until reaching 360. To aid in orientation, a compass rose  reference to magnetic north is superimposed on aeronautical  charts at the station location.  

VOR ground stations transmit within a VHF frequency band  of 108.0–117.95 MHz. Because the equipment is VHF, the  signals transmitted are subject to line-of-sight restrictions.  Therefore, its range varies in direct proportion to the altitude  of receiving equipment. Generally, the reception range of  the signals at an altitude of 1,000 feet above ground level  (AGL) is about 40 to 45 miles. This distance increases with  altitude.  [Figure 16-28]  

![](images/3abbd1bcd4d27803bb960b1b1968794f891186a2e9afb61a7127de86648a5ad3.jpg)  
Figure 16-28.   VHF transmissions follow a line-of-sight course.  

VORs and VORTACs are classed according to operational  use. There are three classes:  

•	 T (Terminal) •	 L (Low altitude) •	 H (High altitude)  

The normal useful range for the various classes is shown in  the following table:  

# VOR/VORTAC NAVAIDS  

Normal Usable Altitudes and Radius Distances  

![](images/283c4a29d944d99b2e3db58c0903ab26e52b795bca382cc1d9e5379daa8d7597.jpg)  

The useful range of certain facilities may be less than 50  miles. For further information concerning these restrictions,  refer to the Communication/NAVAID Remarks in the Chart  Supplement U.S.  

The accuracy of course alignment of VOR radials is  considered to be excellent. It is generally within plus or minus   $1^{\circ}$  . However, certain parts of the VOR receiver equipment  deteriorate, affecting its accuracy. This is particularly true  at great distances from the VOR station. The best assurance  of maintaining an accurate VOR receiver is periodic checks  and calibrations. VOR accuracy checks are not a regulatory  requirement for VFR flight. However, to assure accuracy of  the equipment, these checks should be accomplished quite  frequently and a complete calibration should be performed  each year. The following means are provided for pilots to  check VOR accuracy:  

•	 FAA VOR test facility (VOT) •	 Certified airborne checkpoints •	 Certified ground checkpoints located on airport  surfaces  

If an aircraft has two VOR receivers installed, a dual VOR  receiver check can be made. To accomplish the dual receiver  check, a pilot must tune both VOR receivers to the same VOR  ground facility. The maximum permissible variation between  the two indicated bearings is   $4^{\circ}$  . A list of the airborne and  ground checkpoints is published in the Chart Supplement U.S.  

Basically, these checks consist of verifying that the VOR  radials the aircraft equipment receives are aligned with the  radials the station transmits. There are not specific tolerances  in VOR checks required for VFR flight. But as a guide to  assure acceptable accuracy, the required IFR tolerances can  be used—  $\pm4^{\circ}$   for ground checks and  $\pm6^{\circ}$   for airborne checks.  These checks can be performed by the pilot.  

The VOR transmitting station can be positively identified  by its Morse code identification or by a recorded voice  identification that states the name of the station followed by  “VOR.” Many FSSs transmit voice messages on the same  frequency that the VOR operates. Voice transmissions should  not be relied upon to identify stations because many FSSs  remotely transmit over several omniranges that have names  different from that of the transmitting FSS. If the VOR is  out of service for maintenance, the coded identification is  removed and not transmitted. This serves to alert pilots that  this station should not be used for navigation. VOR receivers  are designed with an alarm flag to indicate when signal  strength is inadequate to operate the navigational equipment.  This happens if the aircraft is too far from the VOR or the  aircraft is too low and, therefore, is out of the line of sight  of the transmitting signals.  

# Using the VOR  

In review, for VOR radio navigation, there are two  components required: ground transmitter and aircraft  receiving equipment. The ground transmitter is located at a  specific position on the ground and transmits on an assigned  frequency. The aircraft equipment includes a receiver with  a tuning device and a VOR or omninavigation instrument.  The navigation instrument could be a course deviation  indicator (CDI), horizontal situation indicator (HSI), or a  radio magnetic indicator (RMI). Each of these instruments  indicates the course to the tuned VOR.  

# Course Deviation Indicator (CDI)  

The CDI is found in most training aircraft. It consists of an  omnibearing selector (OBS) sometimes referred to as the  course selector, a CDI needle (left-right needle), and a TO/ FROM indicator.  

The course selector is an azimuth dial that can be rotated to  select a desired radial or to determine the radial over which  the aircraft is flying. In addition, the magnetic course “TO”  or “FROM” the station can be determined.  

When the course selector is rotated, it moves the CDI or  needle to indicate the position of the radial relative to the  aircraft. If the course selector is rotated until the deviation  needle is centered, the radial (magnetic course “FROM” the  station) or its reciprocal (magnetic course “TO” the station)  can be determined. The course deviation needle also moves  to the right or left if the aircraft is flown or drifting away  from the radial which is set in the course selector.  

By centering the needle, the course selector indicates either  the course “FROM” the station or the course “TO” the station.  If the flag displays a “TO,” the course shown on the course  selector must be flown to the station.  [Figure 16-29]  If  “FROM” is displayed and the course shown is followed, the  aircraft is flown away from the station.  

# Horizontal Situation Indicator  

The HSI is a direction indicator that uses the output  from a flux valve to drive the compass card. The HSI  [Figure 16-30]  combines the magnetic compass with  navigation signals and a glideslope. The HSI gives the pilot  an indication of the location of the aircraft in relation to the  chosen course or radial.  

In  Figure 16-30,  the aircraft magnetic heading displayed  on the compass card under the lubber line is   $184^{\circ}$  . The  course select pointer shown is set to   $295^{\circ}$  ; the tail of the  pointer indicates the reciprocal,   $115^{\circ}$  . The course deviation  bar operates with a VOR/Localizer (VOR/LOC) or GPS  navigation receiver to indicate left or right deviations from  the course selected with the course select pointer; operating  in the same manner, the angular movement of a conventional  VOR/LOC needle indicates deviation from course.  

The desired course is selected by rotating the course select  pointer, in relation to the compass card, by means of the  

![](images/9320a61c023aaf5149b5045048b4994ab7e2bd54e1b9a1c0ce49de8211c29791.jpg)

course select knob. The HSI has a fixed aircraft symbol  and the course deviation bar displays the aircraft’s position  relative to the selected course. The TO/FROM indicator is a  triangular pointer. When the indicator points to the head of the  course select pointer, the arrow shows the course selected. If  properly intercepted and flown, the course  takes the aircraft  to the chosen facility. When the indicator points to the tail  of the course, the arrow shows that the course selected, if  properly intercepted and flown, takes the aircraft directly  away from the chosen facility.  

When the NAV warning flag appears, it indicates no reliable  signal is being received. The appearance of the HDG flag  indicates the compass card is not functioning properly.  

# Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI)  

The RMI is a navigational aid providing aircraft magnetic  or directional gyro heading and very high frequency  omnidirectional range (VOR), GPS, and automatic direction  

![](images/49e7c115b1c13424ae0586c03f8327676fbb7a9acf9b46bb40e65aaec22f2162.jpg)

finder (ADF) bearing information.  [Figure 16-31]  Remote  indicating compasses were developed to compensate for  errors in and limitations of older types of heading indicators. The remote compass transmitter is a separate unit usually  mounted in a wingtip to eliminate the possibility of magnetic  interference. The RMI consists of a compass card, a heading  index, two bearing pointers, and pointer function switches.  The two pointers are driven by any two combinations of a  GPS, an ADF, and/or a VOR. The pilot has the ability to select  the navigation aid to be indicated. The pointer indicates the  course to the selected NAVAID or waypoint. In  Figure 16-31,   the green pointer is indicating the station tuned on the ADF.  The yellow pointer is indicating the course to a VOR or GPS  waypoint. Note that there is no requirement for a pilot to  select a course with the RMI. Only the selected navigation  source is pointed to by the needle(s).  

# Tracking With VOR  

The following describes a step-by-step procedure for tracking  to and from a VOR station using a CDI.  Figure 16-32 illustrates the procedure.  

First, tune the VOR receiver to the frequency of the selected  VOR station. For example, 115.0 to receive Bravo VOR.  Next, check the identifiers to verify that the desired VOR  is being received. As soon as the VOR is properly tuned,  the course deviation needle deflects either left or right.  Then, rotate the azimuth dial to the course selector until the  course deviation needle centers and the TO-FROM indicator  indicates “TO.” If the needle centers with a “FROM”  indication, the azimuth should be rotated   $180^{\circ}$   because, in  this case, it is desired to fly “TO” the station. Now, turn the  aircraft to the heading indicated on the VOR azimuth dial or  course selector,  $350^{\circ}$   in this example.  

![](images/4985044c2946920f0dca775aa545306afb38b348615ddd96d16ce21d832b61f4.jpg)  
Figure 16-32.   Tracking a radial in a crosswind.  

If a heading of  $350^{\circ}$   is maintained with a wind from the right  as shown, the aircraft drifts to the left of the intended track.  As the aircraft drifts off course, the VOR course deviation  needle gradually moves to the right of center or indicates the  direction of the desired radial or track.  

To return to the desired radial, the aircraft heading must be  altered to the right. As the aircraft returns to the desired track,  the deviation needle slowly returns to center. When centered,  the aircraft is on the desired radial and a left turn must be  made toward, but not to the original heading of  $350^{\circ}$   because  a wind drift correction must be established. The amount of  correction depends upon the strength of the wind. If the wind  velocity is unknown, a trial-and-error method can be used  to find the correct heading. Assume, for this example, a   $10^{\circ}$  correction for a heading of   $360^{\circ}$   is maintained.  

While maintaining a heading of  $360^{\circ}$  , assume that the course  deviation begins to move to the left. This means that the wind  correction of   $10^{\circ}$   is too great and the aircraft is flying to the  right of course. A slight turn to the left should be made to  permit the aircraft to return to the desired radial.  

When the deviation needle centers, a small wind drift  correction of   $5^{\circ}$   or a heading correction of   $355^{\circ}$   should be  flown. If this correction is adequate, the aircraft remains  on the radial. If not, small variations in heading should be  made to keep the needle centered and consequently keep the  aircraft on the radial.  

As the VOR station is passed, the course deviation needle  fluctuates, then settles down, and the “TO” indication  changes to “FROM.” If the aircraft passes to one side of the  station, the needle deflects in the direction of the station as  the indicator changes to “FROM.”  

Generally, the same techniques apply when tracking  outbound as those used for tracking inbound. If the intent is  to fly over the station and track outbound on the reciprocal of  the inbound radial, the course selector should not be changed.  Corrections are made in the same manner to keep the needle  centered. The only difference is that the omnidirectional  range indicator indicates “FROM.”  

If tracking outbound on a course other than the reciprocal of  the inbound radial, this new course or radial must be set in  the course selector and a turn made to intercept this course.  After this course is reached, tracking procedures are the same  as previously discussed.  

# Tips on Using the VOR  

•	 Positively identify the station by its code or voice  identification. •	 Remember that VOR signals are “line-of-sight.” A  weak signal or no signal at all is received if the aircraft  is too low or too far from the station. •	 When navigating to a station, determine the inbound  radial and use this radial. Fly a heading that will  

maintain the course. If the aircraft drifts, fly a heading  to re-intercept the course then apply a correction to  

compensate for wind drift. •	 If minor needle fluctuations occur, avoid changing  headings immediately. Wait a moment to see if the  needle recenters; if it does not, then you must correctly  recenter the course to the needle. •	 When flying “TO” a station, always fly the selected  course with a “TO” indication. When flying “FROM” a  station, always fly the selected course with a “FROM”  indication. If this is not done, the action of the course  deviation needle is reversed. To further explain this  reverse action, if the aircraft is flown toward a station  with a “FROM” indication or away from a station  with a “TO” indication, the course deviation needle  indicates in a direction opposite to that which it should  indicate. For example, if the aircraft drifts to the right  of a radial being flown, the needle moves to the right  or points away from the radial. If the aircraft drifts to  the left of the radial being flown, the needle moves  left or in the direction opposite of the radial. •	 When navigating using the VOR, it is important to  fly headings that maintain or re-intercept the course.  Just turning toward the needle will cause overshooting  the radial and flying an S turn to the left and right of  course.  

# Time and Distance Check From a Station Using a  RMI  

To compute time and distance from a station, first turn the  aircraft to place the RMI bearing pointer on the nearest  $90^{\circ}$  index. Note the time and maintain the heading. When the  RMI bearing pointer has moved   $10^{\circ}$  , note the elapsed time  in seconds and apply the formulas in the following example  to determine the approximate time and distance from a given  station.  [Figure 16-33]  

The time from station may also be calculated by using a short  method based on the above formula, if a  $10^{\circ}$   bearing change  is flown. If the elapsed time for the bearing change is noted  

![](images/c0a946380ec82abcb1fa45b559e9e48f5f8c5cd2020afd2ae421e7cde4a1a01f.jpg)  
Figure 16-33.   Time-distance check example.  

in seconds and a   $10^{\circ}$   bearing change is made, the time from  the station, in minutes, is determined by counting off one  decimal point. Thus, if 75 seconds are required to fly a   $10^{\circ}$  bearing change, the aircraft is 7.5 minutes from the station.  When the RMI bearing pointer is moving rapidly or when  several corrections are required to place the pointer on the  wingtip position, the aircraft is at station passage.  

The distance from the station is computed by multiplying TAS  or GS (in miles per minute) by the previously determined time  in minutes. For example, if the aircraft is 7.5 minutes from  station, flying at a TAS of 120 knots or 2 NM per minute,  the distance from station is   $15~\mathrm{{NM}}$     $7.5\times2=15$  ).  

The accuracy of time and distance checks is governed by  existing wind, degree of bearing change, and accuracy of  timing. The number of variables involved causes the result  to be only an approximation. However, by flying an accurate  heading and checking the time and bearing closely, the pilot  can make a reasonable estimate of time and distance from  the station.  

# Time and Distance Check From a Station Using a  CDI  

To compute time and distance from a station using a CDI,  first tune and identify the VOR station and determine the  radial on which you are located. Then turn inbound and  re-center the needle if necessary. Turn   $90^{\circ}$   left or right, of  the inbound course, rotating the OBS to the nearest   $10^{\circ}$  increment opposite the direction of turn. Maintain heading  and when the CDI centers, note the time. Maintaining the  same heading, rotate the OBS   $10^{\circ}$   in the same direction as  was done previously and note the elapsed time when the  CDI again centers. Time and distance from the station is  determined from the formula shown in  Figure 16-34.  

# Course Intercept  

Course interceptions are performed in most phases of  instrument navigation. The equipment used varies, but an  intercept heading must be flown that results in an angle or  rate of intercept sufficient for solving a particular problem.  

![](images/57d08598e8023d00c0a1f9db88d90378b5efd423969131d1fe70ab7be52e9705.jpg)  
Figure 16-34.   Time-distance check formula using a CDI.  

# Rate of Intercept  

Rate of intercept, seen by the aviator as bearing pointer or  HSI movement, is a result of the following factors:  

•	 The angle at which the aircraft is flown toward a  desired course (angle of intercept) •	 True airspeed and wind (GS) •	 Distance from the station  

# Angle of Intercept  

The angle of intercept is the angle between the heading  of the aircraft (intercept heading) and the desired course.  Controlling this angle by selection/adjustment of the intercept  heading is the easiest and most effective way to control  course interceptions. Angle of intercept must be greater than  the degrees from course, but should not exceed  $90°$  . Within  this limit, make adjustments as needed, to achieve the most  desirable rate of intercept.  

When selecting an intercept heading, the key factor is the  relationship between distance from the station and degrees  from the course. Each degree, or radial, is   $1\ \mathrm{{NM}}$   wide at  a distance of   $60~\mathrm{{NM}}$   from the station. Width increases or  decreases in proportion to the  $60\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   distance. For example,  1 degree is 2 NM wide at   $120\;\mathrm{{NM}}.$  —and  $\%$   NM wide at 30  NM. For a given GS and angle of intercept, the resultant rate  of intercept varies according to the distance from the station.  When selecting an intercept heading to form an angle of  intercept, consider the following factors:  

•	 Degrees from course •	 Distance from the station •	 True airspeed and wind (GS)  

# Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)  

Distance measuring equipment (DME) consists of an ultra  high frequency (UHF) navigational aid with VOR/DMEs and  VORTACs. It measures, in NM, the slant range distance of  an aircraft from a VOR/DME or VORTAC (both hereafter  referred to as a VORTAC). Although DME equipment is  very popular, not all aircraft are DME equipped.  

To utilize DME, the pilot should select, tune, and identify  a VORTAC, as previously described. The DME receiver,  utilizing what is called a “paired frequency” concept,  automatically selects and tunes the UHF DME frequency  associated with the VHF VORTAC frequency selected by  the pilot. This process is entirely transparent to the pilot.  After a brief pause, the DME display shows the slant range  distance to or from the VORTAC. Slant range distance is the  direct distance between the aircraft and the VORTAC and  is therefore affected by aircraft altitude. (Station passage  directly over a VORTAC from an altitude of 6,076 feet AGL  would show approximately  $1.0\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   on the DME.) DME is a  very useful adjunct to VOR navigation. A VOR radial alone  merely gives line of position information. With DME, a pilot  may precisely locate the aircraft on a given line (radial).  

Most DME receivers also provide GS and time-to-station  modes of operation. The GS is displayed in knots (NMPH).  The time-to-station mode displays the minutes remaining to  VORTAC station passage, predicated upon the present GS.  GS and time-to-station information is only accurate when  tracking directly to or from a VORTAC. DME receivers  typically need a minute or two of stabilized flight directly  to or from a VORTAC before displaying accurate GS or  time-to-station information.  

Some DME installations have a hold feature that permits a  DME signal to be retained from one VORTAC while the  course indicator displays course deviation information from  an ILS or another VORTAC.  

# VOR/DME RNAV  

Area navigation (RNAV) permits electronic course guidance  on any direct route between points established by the pilot.  While RNAV is a generic term that applies to a variety  of NAVAIDS, such as GPS and others, this section deals  with VOR/DME-based RNAV. VOR/DME RNAV is not a  separate ground-based NAVAID, but a method of navigation  using VOR/DME and VORTAC signals specially processed  by the aircraft’s RNAV computer.  [Figure 16-35]  

NOTE: In this section, the term “VORTAC” also includes  VOR/DME NAVAIDs.  

In its simplest form, VOR/DME RNAV allows the pilot to  electronically move VORTACs around to more convenient  locations. Once electronically relocated, they are referred  to as waypoints. These waypoints are described as a  combination of a selected radial and distance within the  service volume of the VORTAC to be used. These waypoints  allow a straight course to be flown between almost any  origin and destination, without regard to the orientation of  VORTACs or the existence of airways.  

![](images/9e3e9bb4f87c291e158896148753c5b4e9af157561574560bce96a9af3b0805c.jpg)  
Figure 16-35.   Flying an RNAV course.  

While the capabilities and methods of operation of VOR/ DME RNAV units differ, there are basic principles of  operation that are common to all. Pilots are urged to study  the manufacturer’s operating guide and receive instruction  prior to the use of VOR/DME RNAV or any unfamiliar  navigational system. Operational information and limitations  should also be sought from placards and the supplement  section of the AFM/POH.  

VOR/DME-based RNAV units operate in at least three  modes: VOR, en route, and approach. A fourth mode, VOR  Parallel, may also be found on some models. The units need  both VOR and DME signals to operate in any RNAV mode.  If the NAVAID selected is a VOR without DME, RNAV  mode will not function.  

In the VOR (or non-RNAV) mode, the unit simply functions  as a VOR receiver with DME capability.  [Figure 16-36]  The  unit’s display on the VOR indicator is conventional in all  respects. For operation on established airways or any other  ordinary VOR navigation, the VOR mode is used.  

To utilize the unit’s RNAV capability, the pilot selects and  establishes a waypoint or a series of waypoints to define a  course. A VORTAC (or VOR/DME) needs to be selected  as a NAVAID, since both radial and distance signals are  available from these stations. To establish a waypoint, a  point somewhere within the service range of a VORTAC is  defined on the basis of radial and distance. Once the waypoint  is entered into the unit and the RNAV en route mode is  selected, the CDI displays course guidance to the waypoint,  not the original VORTAC. DME also displays distance to  the waypoint. Many units have the capability to store several  waypoints, allowing them to be programmed prior to flight,  if desired, and called up in flight.  

RNAV waypoints are entered into the unit in magnetic  bearings (radials) of degrees and tenths (i.e.,   $275.5^{\circ})$  ) and  distances in NM and tenths (i.e.,  $25.2\;\mathrm{NM})$  ). When plotting  RNAV waypoints on an aeronautical chart, pilots find it  

![](images/2256766e4c59bf66a69698bf78bb1c969bfe170c8a2a36589a7de8b6b38d3f3d.jpg)  
Figure 16-36.   RNAV controls.  

difficult to measure to that level of accuracy, and in practical  application, it is rarely necessary. A number of flight planning  publications publish airport coordinates and waypoints with  this precision and the unit accepts those figures. There is a  subtle but important difference in CDI operation and display  in the RNAV modes.  

In the RNAV modes, course deviation is displayed in terms  of linear deviation. In the RNAV en route mode, maximum  deflection of the CDI typically represents 5 NM on either  side of the selected course without regard to distance from the  waypoint. In the RNAV approach mode, maximum deflection  of the CDI typically represents   $1\%$   NM on either side of the  selected course. There is no increase in CDI sensitivity as the  aircraft approaches a waypoint in RNAV mode.  

The RNAV approach mode is used for instrument approaches.  Its narrow scale width (  $\%$   of the en route mode) permits very  precise tracking to or from the selected waypoint. In VFR  cross-country navigation, tracking a course in the approach  mode is not desirable because it requires a great deal of  attention and soon becomes tedious.  

A fourth, lesser-used mode on some units is the VOR  Parallel mode. This permits the CDI to display linear  (not angular) deviation as the aircraft tracks to and from  VORTACs. It derives its name from permitting the pilot  to offset (or parallel) a selected course or airway at a fixed  distance of the pilot’s choosing, if desired. The VOR parallel  mode has the same effect as placing a waypoint directly  over an existing VORTAC. Some pilots select the VOR  parallel mode when utilizing the navigation (NAV) tracking  function of their autopilot for smoother course following  near the VORTAC.  

Navigating an aircraft with VOR/DME-based RNAV can be  confusing, and it is essential that the pilot become familiar  with the equipment installed. It is not unknown for pilots to  operate inadvertently in one of the RNAV modes when the  operation was not intended, by overlooking switch positions  or annunciators. The reverse has also occurred with a pilot  neglecting to place the unit into one of the RNAV modes by  overlooking switch positions or annunciators. As always, the  prudent pilot is not only familiar with the equipment used,  but never places complete reliance in just one method of  navigation when others are available for cross-check.  

# Automatic Direction Finder (ADF)  

Many general aviation-type aircraft are equipped with ADF  radio receiving equipment. To navigate using the ADF,  the pilot tunes the receiving equipment to a ground station  known as a nondirectional radio beacon (NDB). The NDB  stations normally operate in a low or medium frequency band  of 200 to  $415\:\mathrm{kHz}$  . The frequencies are readily available on  aeronautical charts or in the Chart Supplement U.S.  

All radio beacons, except compass locators, transmit  a continuous three-letter identification in code, except  during voice transmissions. A compass locator, which is  associated with an instrument landing system, transmits a  two-letter identification.  

Standard broadcast stations can also be used in conjunction  with ADF. Positive identification of all radio stations is  extremely important and this is particularly true when using  standard broadcast stations for navigation.  

NDBs have one advantage over the VOR in that low or  medium frequencies are not affected by line-of-sight. The  signals follow the curvature of the Earth; therefore, if the  aircraft is within the range of the station, the signals can be  received regardless of altitude.  

The following table gives the class of NDB stations, their  power, and their usable range:  

![NONDIRECTIONAL RADIO BEACON (NDB) (Usable radius distances for all altitudes) ](images/dfcce1824653fbc9be5c4f342cb13c7b16707fd09286f9da2bb932c56341cc85.jpg)  
\* Service range of individual facilities may be less than  50 miles.  

One of the disadvantages that should be considered when  using low frequency (LF) for navigation is that LF signals are  very susceptible to electrical disturbances, such as lightning.  These disturbances create excessive static, needle deviations,  and signal fades. There may be interference from distant  stations. Pilots should know the conditions under which these  disturbances can occur so they can be more alert to possible  interference when using the ADF.  

Basically, the ADF aircraft equipment consists of a tuner,  which is used to set the desired station frequency, and the  navigational display.  

The navigational display consists of a dial upon which the  azimuth is printed and a needle which rotates around the  dial and points to the station to which the receiver is tuned.  

Some of the ADF dials can be rotated to align the  azimuth with the aircraft heading; others are fixed with  $0^{\circ}$  representing the nose of the aircraft and   $180^{\circ}$   representing  the tail. Only the fixed azimuth dial is discussed in this  handbook.  [Figure 16-37]  

Figure 16-38  illustrates terms that are used with the ADF  and should be understood by the pilot.  

To determine the magnetic bearing “FROM” the station,   $180^{\circ}$   is added to or subtracted from the magnetic bearing to  the station. This is the reciprocal bearing and is used when  plotting position fixes.  

![](images/e9bed626eebd69458764d98f024881c88c6e8d3d4c9a3c50aa4eef1e552ed0c3.jpg)

Figure 16-38.   ADF terms.  

Keep in mind that the needle of fixed azimuth points to the  station in relation to the nose of the aircraft. If the needle  is deflected   $30^{\circ}$   to the left for a relative bearing of   $330^{\circ}$  ,  this means that the station is located  $30^{\circ}$   left. If the aircraft  is turned left   $30^{\circ}$  , the needle moves to the right   $30^{\circ}$   and  indicates a relative bearing of   $0^{\circ}$   meaning that the aircraft  is pointing toward the station. If the pilot continues flight  toward the station keeping the needle on   $0^{\circ}$  , the procedure  is called homing to the station. If a crosswind exists, the  ADF needle continues to drift away from zero. To keep the  needle on zero, the aircraft must be turned slightly resulting  in a curved flight path to the station. Homing to the station  is a common procedure but may result in drifting downwind,  thus lengthening the distance to the station.  

Tracking to the station requires correcting for wind drift and  results in maintaining flight along a straight track or bearing  to the station. When the wind drift correction is established,  the ADF needle indicates the amount of correction to the  right or left. For instance, if the magnetic bearing to the  station is   $340^{\circ}$  , a correction for a left crosswind would  result in a magnetic heading of   $330^{\circ}$  , and the ADF needle  would indicate  $10^{\circ}$   to the right or a relative bearing of  $010^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 16-39]  

When tracking away from the station, wind corrections are  made similar to tracking to the station, but the ADF needle  points toward the tail of the aircraft or the   $180^{\circ}$   position on  the azimuth dial. Attempting to keep the ADF needle on  the   $180^{\circ}$   position during winds results in the aircraft flying  a curved flight leading further and further from the desired  track. When tracking outbound, corrections for wind should  be made in the direction opposite of that in which the needle  is pointing.  

Although the ADF is not as popular as the VOR for radio  navigation, with proper precautions and intelligent use, the  ADF can be a valuable aid to navigation.  

# Global Positioning System  

The GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system.  Its RNAV guidance is worldwide in scope. There are no  symbols for GPS on aeronautical charts as it is a space-based  system with global coverage. Development of the system is  underway so that GPS is capable of providing the primary  means of electronic navigation. Portable and yoke-mounted  units are proving to be very popular in addition to those  permanently installed in the aircraft. Extensive navigation  databases are common features in aircraft GPS receivers.  

![](images/88593a08f562cd9fed2c05a2940f314ea8604721f80b2680a78196cd2ed249d2.jpg)  
Figure 16-39.   ADF tracking.  

The GPS is a satellite radio navigation and time dissemination  system developed and operated by the U.S. Department of  Defense (DOD). Civilian interface and GPS system status  is available from the U.S. Coast Guard.  

It is not necessary to understand the technical aspects of  GPS operation to use it in VFR/IFR navigation. It does differ  significantly from conventional, ground-based electronic  navigation and awareness of those differences is important.  Awareness of equipment approvals and limitations is critical  to the safety of flight.  

The GPS navigation system broadcasts a signal that is used  by receivers to determine precise position anywhere in the  world. The receiver tracks multiple satellites and determines  a pseudorange measurement to determine the user location.  A minimum of four satellites is necessary to establish an  accurate three-dimensional position. The Department of  Defense (DOD) is responsible for operating the GPS satellite  constellation and monitors the GPS satellites to ensure proper  operation.  

The status of a GPS satellite is broadcast as part of the data  message transmitted by the satellite. GPS status information  is also available from the U.S. Coast Guard navigation  information service at (703) 313-5907 or online at www. navcen.uscg.gov. Additionally, satellite status is available  through the NOTAM system.  

The GPS receiver verifies the integrity (usability) of the  signals received from the GPS constellation through receiver  autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) to determine if  a satellite is providing corrupted information. At least one  satellite, in addition to those required for navigation, must  be in view for the receiver to perform the RAIM function;  thus, RAIM needs a minimum of five satellites in view or  four satellites and a barometric altimeter (baro-aiding) to  detect an integrity anomaly. For receivers capable of doing  so, RAIM needs six satellites in view (or five satellites with  baro-aiding) to isolate the corrupt satellite signal and remove  it from the navigation solution. Baro-aiding is a method of  augmenting the GPS integrity solution by using a nonsatellite  input source. GPS derived altitude should not be relied upon  to determine aircraft altitude since the vertical error can  be quite large and no integrity is provided. To ensure that  baro-aiding is available, the current altimeter setting must be  entered into the receiver as described in the operating manual.  

RAIM messages vary somewhat between receivers; however,  generally there are two types. One type indicates that there  are not enough satellites available to provide RAIM integrity  monitoring and another type indicates that the RAIM integrity  monitor has detected a potential error that exceeds the limit  for the current phase of flight. Without RAIM capability, the  pilot has no assurance of the accuracy of the GPS position.  

# Selective Availability  

Selective Availability (SA) is a method by which the accuracy  of GPS is intentionally degraded. This feature is designed  to deny hostile use of precise GPS positioning data. SA was  discontinued on May 1, 2000, but many GPS receivers are  designed to assume that SA is still active.  

The baseline GPS satellite constellation consists of 24  satellites positioned in six earth-centered orbital planes  with four operation satellites and a spare satellite slot in  each orbital plane. The system can support a constellation  of up to thirty satellites in orbit. The orbital period of a GPS  satellite is one-half of a sidereal day or 11 hours 58 minutes.  The orbits are nearly circular and equally spaced about the  equator at a 60-degree separation with an inclination of  55 degrees relative to the equator. The orbital radius (i.e.  distance from the center of mass of the earth to the satellite)  is approximately  $26{,}600\,\mathrm{km}$  .  

With the baseline satellite constellation, users with a clear  view of the sky have a minimum of four satellites in view.  It is more likely that a user would see six to eight satellites.  The satellites broadcast ranging signals and navigation data  allowing users to measure their pseudoranges in order to  estimate their position, velocity and time, in a passive, listen- only mode. The receiver uses data from a minimum of four  satellites above the mask angle (the lowest angle above the  horizon at which a receiver can use a satellite). The exact  number of satellites operating at any one particular time  varies depending on the number of satellite outages and  operational spares in orbit. For current status of the GPS  constellation, please visit http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpscurr. html.  [Figure 16-40]  

# VFR Use of GPS  

GPS navigation has become a great asset to VFR pilots  providing increased navigation capability and enhanced  situational awareness while reducing operating costs due  to greater ease in flying direct routes. While GPS has many  benefits to the VFR pilot, care must be exercised to ensure  that system capabilities are not exceeded.  

Types of receivers used for GPS navigation under VFR are  varied from a full IFR installation being used to support a  VFR flight to a VFR only installation (in either a VFR or IFR  capable aircraft) to a hand-held receiver. The limitations of  

![](images/8b1592e88c0ed60b69605ab3181880affa8f897113b409ba7367796f1e522bcc.jpg)  
Figure 16-40.   Satellite constellation.  

each type of receiver installation or use must be understood  by the pilot to avoid misusing navigation information. In all  cases, VFR pilots should never rely solely on one system  of navigation. GPS navigation must be integrated with  other forms of electronic navigation, as well as pilotage  and dead reckoning. Only through the integration of these  techniques can the VFR pilot ensure accuracy in navigation.  Some critical concerns in VFR use of GPS include RAIM  capability, database currency, and antenna location.  

# RAIM Capability  

Many VFR GPS receivers and all hand-held units are not  equipped with RAIM alerting capability. Loss of the required  number of satellites in view, or the detection of a position  error, cannot be displayed to the pilot by such receivers.  In receivers with no RAIM capability, no alert would  be provided to the pilot that the navigation solution had  deteriorated and an undetected navigation error could occur.  A systematic cross-check with other navigation techniques  would identify this failure and prevent a serious deviation.  

In many receivers, an updatable database is used for  navigation fixes, airports, and instrument procedures.  These databases must be maintained to the current update  for IFR operation, but no such requirement exists for VFR  use. However, in many cases, the database drives a moving  map display that indicates Special Use Airspace and the  various classes of airspace in addition to other operational  information. Without a current database, the moving map  display may be outdated and offer erroneous information  to VFR pilots wishing to fly around critical airspace areas,  such as a Restricted Area or a Class B airspace segment.  Numerous pilots have ventured into airspace they were trying  to avoid by using an outdated database. If there is not a current  database in the receiver, disregard the moving map display  when making critical navigation decisions.  

In addition, waypoints are added, removed, relocated, or re- named as required to meet operational needs. When using  GPS to navigate relative to a named fix, a current database  must be used to properly locate a named waypoint. Without  the update, it is the pilot’s responsibility to verify the  waypoint location referencing to an official current source,  such as the Chart Supplement U.S., sectional chart, or en  route chart.  

In many VFR installations of GPS receivers, antenna location  is more a matter of convenience than performance. In IFR  installations, care is exercised to ensure that an adequate  clear view is provided for the antenna to communicate with  satellites. If an alternate location is used, some portion of  the aircraft may block the view of the antenna increasing the  possibility of losing navigation signal.  

This is especially true in the case of hand-held receivers. The  use of hand-held receivers for VFR operations is a growing  trend, especially among rental pilots. Typically, suction cups  are used to place the GPS antennas on the inside of aircraft  windows. While this method has great utility, the antenna  location is limited by aircraft structure for optimal reception  of available satellites. Consequently, signal loss may occur  in certain situations where aircraft-satellite geometry causes  a loss of navigation signal. These losses, coupled with a lack  of RAIM capability, could present erroneous position and  navigation information with no warning to the pilot.  

While the use of hand-held GPS receivers for VFR operations  is not limited by regulation, modification of the aircraft, such  as installing a panel- or yoke-mounted holder, is governed by  14 CFR part 43. Pilots should consult a mechanic to ensure  compliance with the regulation and a safe installation.  

# Tips for Using GPS for VFR Operations  

Always check to see if the unit has RAIM capability. If no  RAIM capability exists, be suspicious of a GPS displayed  position when any disagreement exists with the position  derived from other radio navigation systems, pilotage, or  dead reckoning.  

Check the currency of the database, if any. If expired, update  the database using the current revision. If an update of an  expired database is not possible, disregard any moving map  display of airspace for critical navigation decisions. Be aware  that named waypoints may no longer exist or may have been  relocated since the database expired. At a minimum, the  waypoints to be used should be verified against a current  official source, such as the Chart Supplement U.S. or a  Sectional Aeronautical Chart.  

While a hand-held GPS receiver can provide excellent  navigation capability to VFR pilots, be prepared for  intermittent loss of navigation signal, possibly with no RAIM  warning to the pilot. If mounting the receiver in the aircraft,  be sure to comply with 14 CFR part 43.  

Plan flights carefully before taking off. If navigating to user- defined waypoints, enter them prior to flight, not on the fly.  Verify the planned flight against a current source, such as a  current sectional chart. There have been cases in which one  pilot used waypoints created by another pilot that were not  where the pilot flying was expecting. This generally resulted  in a navigation error. Minimize head-down time in the aircraft  and maintain a sharp lookout for traffic, terrain, and obstacles.  Just a few minutes of preparation and planning on the ground  makes a great difference in the air.  

Another way to minimize head-down time is to become very  familiar with the receiver’s operation. Most receivers are not  intuitive. The pilot must take the time to learn the various  keystrokes, knob functions, and displays that are used in  the operation of the receiver. Some manufacturers provide  computer-based tutorials or simulations of their receivers.  Take the time to learn about the particular unit before using  it in flight.  

In summary, be careful not to rely on GPS to solve all VFR  navigational problems. Unless an IFR receiver is installed in  accordance with IFR requirements, no standard of accuracy  or integrity can be assured. While the practicality of GPS is  compelling, the fact remains that only the pilot can navigate the  aircraft, and GPS is just one of the pilot’s tools to do the job.  

# VFR Waypoints  

VFR waypoints provide VFR pilots with a supplementary  tool to assist with position awareness while navigating  visually in aircraft equipped with area navigation receivers.  VFR waypoints should be used as a tool to supplement current  navigation procedures. The use of VFR waypoints include  providing navigational aids for pilots unfamiliar with an area,  waypoint definition of existing reporting points, enhanced  navigation in and around Class B and Class C airspace, and  enhanced navigation around Special Use Airspace. VFR  pilots should rely on appropriate and current aeronautical  charts published specifically for visual navigation. If  operating in a terminal area, pilots should take advantage of  the Terminal Area Chart available for the area, if published.  The use of VFR waypoints does not relieve the pilot of any  responsibility to comply with the operational requirements  of 14 CFR part 91.  

VFR waypoint names (for computer entry and flight plans)  consist of five letters beginning with the letters “VP” and are  retrievable from navigation databases. The VFR waypoint  names are not intended to be pronounceable, and they are not  for use in ATC communications. On VFR charts, a stand- alone VFR waypoint is portrayed using the same four-point  star symbol used for IFR waypoints. VFR waypoint collocated  with a visual checkpoint on the chart is identified by a small  magenta flag symbol. A VFR waypoint collocated with a  visual checkpoint is pronounceable based on the name of the  visual checkpoint and may be used for ATC communications.  Each VFR waypoint name appears in parentheses adjacent  to the geographic location on the chart. Latitude/longitude  data for all established VFR waypoints may be found in the  appropriate regional Chart Supplement U.S.  

When filing VFR flight plans, use the five-letter identifier as  a waypoint in the route of flight section if there is an intended  course change at that point or if used to describe the planned  route of flight. This VFR filing would be similar to VOR use  in a route of flight. Pilots must use the VFR waypoints only  when operating under VFR conditions.  

Any VFR waypoints intended for use during a flight should  be loaded into the receiver while on the ground and prior to  departure. Once airborne, pilots should avoid programming  routes or VFR waypoint chains into their receivers.  

Pilots should be especially vigilant for other traffic while  operating near VFR waypoints. The same effort to see and  avoid other aircraft near VFR waypoints is necessary, as  is the case when operating near VORs and NDBs. In fact,  the increased accuracy of navigation through the use of  GPS demands even greater vigilance as there are fewer  off-course deviations among different pilots and receivers.  When operating near a VFR waypoint, use all available  ATC services, even if outside a class of airspace where  communications are required. Regardless of the class of  airspace, monitor the available ATC frequency closely for  information on other aircraft operating in the vicinity. It is  also a good idea to turn on landing light(s) when operating  near a VFR waypoint to make the aircraft more conspicuous  to other pilots, especially when visibility is reduced.  

# Lost Procedures  

Getting lost in flight is a potentially dangerous situation,  especially when low on fuel. If a pilot becomes lost, there  are some good common sense procedures to follow. If a town  or city cannot be seen, the first thing to do is climb, being  mindful of traffic and weather conditions. An increase in  altitude increases radio and navigation reception range and  also increases radar coverage. If flying near a town or city, it  may be possible to read the name of the town on a water tower.  

If the aircraft has a navigational radio, such as a VOR or ADF  receiver, it can be possible to determine position by plotting  an azimuth from two or more navigational facilities. If GPS  is installed, or a pilot has a portable aviation GPS on board,  it can be used to determine the position and the location of  the nearest airport.  

Communicate with any available facility using frequencies  shown on the sectional chart. If contact is made with a  controller, radar vectors may be offered. Other facilities may  offer direction finding (DF) assistance. To use this procedure,  the controller requests the pilot to hold down the transmit  button for a few seconds and then release it. The controller  may ask the pilot to change directions a few times and repeat  the transmit procedure. This gives the controller enough  information to plot the aircraft position and then give vectors  to a suitable landing site. If the situation becomes threatening,  transmit the situation on the emergency frequency   $121.5\,\mathrm{MHz}$  and set the transponder to 7700. Most facilities, and even  airliners, monitor the emergency frequency.  

# Flight Diversion  

There may come a time when a pilot is not able to make it to  the planned destination. This can be the result of unpredicted  weather conditions, a system malfunction, or poor preflight  planning. In any case, the pilot needs to be able to safely  and efficiently divert to an alternate destination. Risk  management procedures become a priority during any type  of flight diversion and should be used the pilot. For example,  the hazards of inadvertent VFR into IMC involve a risk that  the pilot can identify and assess and then mitigate through a  pre-planned or in-flight diversion around hazardous weather.  Before any cross-country flight, check the charts for airports  or suitable landing areas along or near the route of flight.  Also, check for navigational aids that can be used during a  diversion. Risk management is explained in greater detail in  Chapter 2, Aeronautical Decision-making.  

Computing course, time, speed, and distance information in  flight requires the same computations used during preflight  planning. However, because of the limited flight deck space  and because attention must be divided between flying the  aircraft, making calculations, and scanning for other aircraft,  take advantage of all possible shortcuts and rule-of-thumb  computations.  

When in flight, it is rarely practical to actually plot a course  on a sectional chart and mark checkpoints and distances.  Furthermore, because an alternate airport is usually not very far  from your original course, actual plotting is seldom necessary.  

The course to an alternate destination can be measured  accurately with a protractor or plotter but can also be  measured with reasonable accuracy using a straightedge  and the compass rose depicted around VOR stations. This  approximation can be made on the basis of a radial from a  nearby VOR or an airway that closely parallels the course  to your alternate destination. However, remember that the  magnetic heading associated with a VOR radial or printed  airway is outbound from the station. To find the course to  the station, it may be necessary to determine the reciprocal of  that heading. It is typically easier to navigate to an alternate  airport that has a VOR or NDB facility on the field.  

After selecting the most appropriate alternate destination,  approximate the magnetic course to the alternate using a  compass rose or airway on the sectional chart. If time permits,  try to start the diversion over a prominent ground feature.  

However, in an emergency, divert promptly toward your  alternate destination. Attempting to complete all plotting,  measuring, and computations involved before diverting to the  alternate destination may only aggravate an actual emergency.  

Once established on course, note the time, and then use the  winds aloft nearest to your diversion point to calculate a  heading and GS. Once a GS has been calculated, determine a  new arrival time and fuel consumption. Give priority to flying  the aircraft while dividing attention between navigation and  planning. When determining an altitude to use while diverting,  consider cloud heights, winds, terrain, and radio reception.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter has discussed the fundamentals of VFR  navigation. Beginning with an introduction to the charts that  can be used for navigation to the more technically advanced  concept of GPS, there is one aspect of navigation that remains  the same—the pilot is responsible for proper planning and  the execution of that planning to ensure a safe flight.  

# Chapter 17 Aeromedical  Factors  

# Introduction  

It is important for a pilot to be aware of the mental and  physical standards required for the type of flying performed.  This chapter provides information on medical certification and  on a variety of aeromedical factors related to flight activities.  

#  

#  

# Obtaining a Medical Certificate  

Most pilots must have a valid medical certificate to exercise  the privileges of their airman certificates. Glider and free  balloon pilots are not required to hold a medical certificate.  Sport pilots may hold either a medical certificate or a valid  state driver’s license. Regardless of whether a medical  certificate or drivers license is required, 14 CFR 61.53  requires every pilot not to act as a crewmember if they know,  or have reason to know, of any medical condition that would  make them unable to operate the aircraft in a safe manner.  

Acquisition of a medical certificate requires an examination  by an aviation medical examiner (AME), a physician  with training in aviation medicine designated by the Civil  Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI). There are three classes  of medical certificates. The class of certificate needed  depends on the type of flying the pilot plans to perform.  

A third-class medical certificate is required for a private or  recreational pilot certificate. It is valid for 5 years for those  individuals who have not reached the age of 40; otherwise it  is valid for 2 years. A commercial pilot certificate requires at  least a second-class medical certificate, which is valid for 1  year. First-class medical certificates are required for airline  transport pilots and are valid for one year if the airman is 40  or younger; 40 and older it is valid for 6 months.  

The standards are more rigorous for the higher classes of  certificates. A pilot with a higher class medical certificate  has met the requirements for the lower classes as well. Since  the required medical class applies only when exercising the  privileges of the pilot certificate for which it is required, a  first-class medical certificate would be valid for 1 year if  exercising the privileges of a commercial certificate and 2 or 5  years, as appropriate, for exercising the privileges of a private  or recreational certificate. The same applies for a second-class  medical certificate. The standards for medical certification  are contained in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 67 and the requirements for obtaining medical  certificates can be found in 14 CFR part 61.  

Students who have physical limitations, such as impaired  vision, loss of a limb, or hearing impairment may be issued  a medical certificate valid for “student pilot privileges only”  while learning to fly. Pilots with disabilities may require  special equipment to be installed in the aircraft, such as  hand controls for pilots with paraplegia. Some disabilities  necessitate a limitation on the individual’s certificate; for  example, impaired hearing would require the limitation  “not valid for flight requiring the use of radio.” When all the  knowledge, experience, and proficiency requirements have  been met and a student can demonstrate the ability to operate  the aircraft with the normal level of safety, a “statement of  demonstrated ability” (SODA) can be issued. This waiver,  or SODA, is valid as long as the physical impairment does  not worsen. Contact the local Flight Standards District Office  (FSDO) for more information on this subject.  

The FAA medical standards, 14 CFR part 67, specify fifteen  medical conditions that are considered disqualifying by  “history or clinical diagnosis.” Regardless of when one of  these conditions was diagnosed and treated, an airman may  not be issued a medical certificate except through a process  called a “Special Issuance Authorization,” as explained  in 14 CFR part 67, section 67.401. A special issuance is a  discretionary issuance by the FAA Federal Air Surgeon and  requires satisfactory completion of special testing determined  by the FAA to demonstrate that an airman is safe to fly for  the duration of the medical certificate issued. The specific  disqualifying conditions include:  

• 	 Diabetes mellitus requiring oral hypoglycemic  medication or insulin • 	 Angina pectoris • 	 Coronary heart disease that has been treated or, if  untreated, that has been symptomatic or clinically  significant • 	 Myocardial infarction • 	 Cardiac valve replacement • 	 Permanent cardiac pacemaker • 	 Heart replacement • 	 Psychosis • 	 Bipolar disorder • 	 Personality disorder that is severe enough to have  repeatedly manifested itself by overt acts • 	 Substance dependence (including alcohol) • 	 Substance abuse • 	 Epilepsy • 	 Disturbance of consciousness and without satisfactory  explanation of cause • 	 Transient loss of control of nervous system function(s)  without satisfactory explanation of cause  

However, this list includes only the mandatory disqualifying  conditions. There are many other medical conditions that fall  into the General Medical Condition section of the regulations  that are considered by the FAA to be disqualifying even  though they are not stated in the regulations. Conditions  such as cancer, kidney stones, neurologic and neuromuscular  conditions including Parkinson’s disease and multiple  sclerosis, certain blood disorders, and other conditions that  may progress over time require review by the FAA before a  medical certificate may be issued.  

The important thing to remember is that with very few  exceptions, all disqualifying medical conditions may  be considered for special issuance. If you can present  satisfactory medical documentation to the FAA that your  condition is stable, the chances are good that you will be  able to qualify for an Authorization.  

# Health and Physiological Factors  Affecting Pilot Performance  

A number of health factors and physiological effects can be  linked to flying. Some are minor, while others are important  enough to require special attention to ensure safety of flight.  In some cases, physiological factors can lead to inflight  emergencies. Some important medical factors that a pilot  should be aware of include hypoxia, hyperventilation,  middle ear and sinus problems, spatial disorientation, motion  sickness, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, stress and  fatigue, dehydration, and heatstroke. Other subjects include  the effects of alcohol and drugs, anxiety, and excess nitrogen  in the blood after scuba diving.  

# Hypoxia  

Hypoxia means “reduced oxygen” or “not enough oxygen.”  Although any tissue will die if deprived of oxygen long  enough, the greatest concern regarding hypoxia during  flight is lack of oxygen to the brain, since it is particularly  vulnerable to oxygen deprivation. Any reduction in mental  function while flying can result in life-threatening errors.  Hypoxia can be caused by several factors, including an  insufficient supply of oxygen, inadequate transportation of  oxygen, or the inability of the body tissues to use oxygen.  The forms of hypoxia are based on their causes:  

•	 Hypoxic hypoxia  •	 Hypemic hypoxia  •	 Stagnant hypoxia  •	 Histotoxic hypoxia  

# Hypoxic Hypoxia  

Hypoxic hypoxia is a result of insufficient oxygen available  to the body as a whole. A blocked airway and drowning  are obvious examples of how the lungs can be deprived of  oxygen, but the reduction in partial pressure of oxygen at high  altitude is an appropriate example for pilots. Although the  percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere is constant, its partial  pressure decreases proportionately as atmospheric pressure  decreases. As an aircraft ascends during flight, the percentage  of each gas in the atmosphere remains the same, but there are  fewer molecules available at the pressure required for them  to pass between the membranes in the respiratory system.  This decrease in number of oxygen molecules at sufficient  pressure can lead to hypoxic hypoxia.  

# Dangers of Transporting Dry Ice  

Sublimation is a process in which a substance transitions  from a solid to a gaseous state without passing through  an intermediate liquid state. Dry ice sublimates into large  quantities of   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   gas, which can rapidly displace oxygen- containing air and potentially cause hypoxia via carbon  dioxide intoxication. Case studies have shown that both illness  and death can be caused by occupational and/or unintentional  exposure when transporting dry ice in small, confined  spaces such as a flightdeck or airplane. Exposure to high  concentration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   gas may lead to increased respiration,  tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, and unconsciousness.  Exposure to concentration of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   gas in excess of 10 percent  may cause convulsions, coma, and/or death.  

The tendency of dry ice to rapidly sublimate also means that  without proper ventilation, it can rapidly pressurize. For  this reason, dry ice should never be placed inside a sealed  transport container (i.e., leak-proof secondary container)  and must be placed within an outer shipping container or  storage container that allows adequate ventilation to release  the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   gas and avoid pressurization. Sealing dry ice within a  leak-proof container may result in explosion of the container  potentially leading to serious physical injury or death.  

# Hypemic Hypoxia  

Hypemic hypoxia occurs when the blood is not able to take  up and transport a sufficient amount of oxygen to the cells  in the body. Hypemic means “not enough blood.” This type  of hypoxia is a result of oxygen deficiency in the blood,  rather than a lack of inhaled oxygen, and can be caused by  a variety of factors. It may be due to reduced blood volume  (from severe bleeding), or it may result from certain blood  diseases, such as anemia. More often, hypemic hypoxia  occurs because hemoglobin, the actual blood molecule that  transports oxygen, is chemically unable to bind oxygen  molecules. The most common form of hypemic hypoxia is  CO poisoning. This is explained in greater detail later in this  chapter. Hypemic hypoxia can also be caused by the loss  of blood due to blood donation. Blood volume can require  several weeks to return to normal following a donation.  Although the effects of the blood loss are slight at ground  level, there are risks when flying during this time.  

# Stagnant Hypoxia  

Stagnant means “not flowing,” and stagnant hypoxia or  ischemia results when the oxygen-rich blood in the lungs  is not moving, for one reason or another, to the tissues that  need it. An arm or leg “going to sleep” because the blood  flow has accidentally been shut off is one form of stagnant  hypoxia. This kind of hypoxia can also result from shock,  the heart failing to pump blood effectively, or a constricted  artery. During flight, stagnant hypoxia can occur with  excessive acceleration of gravity (Gs). Cold temperatures  can also reduce circulation and decrease the blood supplied  to extremities.  

# Histotoxic Hypoxia  

The inability of the cells to effectively use oxygen is defined  as histotoxic hypoxia. “Histo” refers to tissues or cells, and  “toxic” means poisonous. In this case, enough oxygen is being  transported to the cells that need it, but they are unable to make  use of it. This impairment of cellular respiration can be caused  by alcohol and other drugs, such as narcotics and poisons.  Research has shown that drinking one ounce of alcohol can  equate to an additional 2,000 feet of physiological altitude.  

# Symptoms of Hypoxia  

High-altitude flying can place a pilot in danger of becoming  hypoxic. Oxygen starvation causes the brain and other vital  organs to become impaired. The first symptoms of hypoxia  can include euphoria and a carefree feeling. With increased  oxygen starvation, the extremities become less responsive and  flying becomes less coordinated. The symptoms of hypoxia  vary with the individual, but common symptoms include:  

•	 Cyanosis (blue fingernails and lips) •	 Headache •	 Decreased response to stimuli and increased reaction  time •	 Impaired judgment •	 Euphoria •	 Visual impairment •	 Drowsiness •	 Lightheaded or dizzy sensation •	 Tingling in fingers and toes •	 Numbness  

As hypoxia worsens, the field of vision begins to narrow and  instrument interpretation can become difficult. Even with all  these symptoms, the effects of hypoxia can cause a pilot to  have a false sense of security and be deceived into believing  everything is normal.  

# Treatment of Hypoxia  

Treatment for hypoxia includes flying at lower altitudes and/ or using supplemental oxygen. All pilots are susceptible  to the effects of oxygen starvation, regardless of physical  endurance or acclimatization. When flying at high altitudes,  it is paramount that oxygen be used to avoid the effects of  hypoxia. The term “time of useful consciousness” describes  the maximum time the pilot has to make rational, life-saving  decisions and carry them out at a given altitude without  supplemental oxygen. As altitude increases above 10,000  feet, the symptoms of hypoxia increase in severity, and the  time of useful consciousness rapidly decreases.  [Figure 17-1]  Since symptoms of hypoxia can be different for each  individual, the ability to recognize hypoxia can be greatly  improved by experiencing and witnessing the effects of it  during an altitude chamber “flight.” The Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) provides this opportunity through  aviation physiology training, which is conducted at the FAA  CAMI in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and at many military  facilities across the United States. For information about the  FAA’s one-day physiological training course with altitude  chamber and vertigo demonstrations, visit the FAA website  at www.faa.gov.  

# Hyperventilation  

Hyperventilation is the excessive rate and depth of respiration  leading to abnormal loss of carbon dioxide from the blood.  This condition occurs more often among pilots than is  generally recognized. It seldom incapacitates completely, but  it causes disturbing symptoms that can alarm the uninformed  pilot. In such cases, increased breathing rate and anxiety  further aggravate the problem. Hyperventilation can lead to  unconsciousness due to the respiratory system’s overriding  mechanism to regain control of breathing.  

Pilots encountering an unexpected stressful situation may  subconsciously increase their breathing rate. If flying at  higher altitudes, either with or without oxygen, a pilot may  have a tendency to breathe more rapidly than normal, which  often leads to hyperventilation.  

Since many of the symptoms of hyperventilation are similar  to those of hypoxia, it is important to correctly diagnose and  treat the proper condition. If using supplemental oxygen,  check the equipment and flow rate to ensure the symptoms are  

![Figure 17-1.  Time of useful consciousness. ](images/707bdf559f1e59ba0af85294feb6d5c27c94ea8bec533ca6087422d33444c8f9.jpg)  

not hypoxia related. Common symptoms of hyperventilation  include:  

•	 Visual impairment •	 Unconsciousness •	 Lightheaded or dizzy sensation •	 Tingling sensations •	 Hot and cold sensations •	 Muscle spasms  

The treatment for hyperventilation involves restoring  the proper carbon dioxide level in the body. Breathing  normally is both the best prevention and the best cure  for hyperventilation. In addition to slowing the breathing  rate, breathing into a paper bag or talking aloud helps to  overcome hyperventilation. Recovery is usually rapid once  the breathing rate is returned to normal.  

# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems  

During climbs and descents, the free gas formerly present in  various body cavities expands due to a difference between  the pressure of the air outside the body and that of the air  inside the body. If the escape of the expanded gas is impeded,  pressure builds up within the cavity and pain is experienced.  Trapped gas expansion accounts for ear pain and sinus pain,  as well as a temporary reduction in the ability to hear.  

The middle ear is a small cavity located in the bone of the  skull. It is closed off from the external ear canal by the  eardrum. Normally, pressure differences between the middle  ear and the outside world are equalized by a tube leading  from inside each ear to the back of the throat on each side  called the Eustachian tube. These tubes are usually closed but  open during chewing, yawning, or swallowing to equalize  pressure. Even a slight difference between external pressure  and middle ear pressure can cause discomfort.  [Figure 17-2]  

During a climb, middle ear air pressure may exceed the  pressure of the air in the external ear canal causing the  eardrum to bulge outward. Pilots become aware of this  pressure change when they experience alternate sensations  of “fullness” and “clearing.” During descent, the reverse  happens. While the pressure of the air in the external ear  canal increases, the middle ear cavity, which equalized with  the lower pressure at altitude, is at lower pressure than the  external ear canal. This results in the higher outside pressure  causing the eardrum to bulge inward.  

This condition can be more difficult to relieve due to the  fact that the partial vacuum tends to constrict the walls of  the Eustachian tube. To remedy this often painful condition,  which also causes a temporary reduction in hearing  

![](images/cdbeb77b8e871a54059dd8df216a09755de4817dbe6743d26cc8f39896b6540a.jpg)  
Figure 17-2.   The Eustachian tube allows air pressure to equalize  in the middle ear.  

sensitivity, pinch the nostrils shut, close the mouth and lips,  and blow slowly and gently into the mouth and nose.  

This procedure forces air through the Eustachian tube into the  middle ear. It may not be possible to equalize the pressure in  the ears if a pilot has a cold, an ear infection, or sore throat.  A flight in this condition can be extremely painful, as well as  damaging to the eardrums. If experiencing minor congestion,  nose drops or nasal sprays may reduce the risk of a painful  ear blockage. Before using any medication, check with an  AME to ensure that it will not affect the ability to fly.  

In a similar way, air pressure in the sinuses equalizes with  the pressure in the flight deck through small openings  that connect the sinuses to the nasal passages. An upper  respiratory infection, such as a cold or sinusitis, or a nasal  allergic condition can produce enough congestion around an  opening to slow equalization. As the difference in pressure  between the sinuses and the flight deck increases, congestion  may plug the opening. This “sinus block” occurs most  frequently during descent. Slow descent rates can reduce the  associated pain. A sinus block can occur in the frontal sinuses,  located above each eyebrow, or in the maxillary sinuses,  located in each upper cheek. It usually produces excruciating  pain over the sinus area. A maxillary sinus block can also  make the upper teeth ache. Bloody mucus may discharge  from the nasal passages.  

Sinus block can be avoided by not flying with an upper  respiratory infection or nasal allergic condition. Adequate  protection is usually not provided by decongestant sprays  or drops to reduce congestion around the sinus openings.  Oral decongestants have side effects that can impair pilot  performance. If a sinus block does not clear shortly after  landing, a physician should be consulted.  

# Spatial Disorientation and Illusions  

Spatial disorientation specifically refers to the lack of  orientation with regard to the position, attitude, or movement  of the airplane in space. The body uses three integrated  systems that work together to ascertain orientation and  movement in space.  

• 	 Vestibular system—organs found in the inner ear that  sense position by the way we are balanced • 	 Somatosensory system—nerves in the skin, muscles,  and joints that, along with hearing, sense position  based on gravity, feeling, and sound •	 Visual system—eyes, which sense position based on  what is seen  

All this information comes together in the brain and, most  of the time, the three streams of information agree, giving  a clear idea of where and how the body is moving. Flying  can sometimes cause these systems to supply conflicting  information to the brain, which can lead to disorientation.  During flight in visual meteorological conditions (VMC),  the eyes are the major orientation source and usually prevail  over false sensations from other sensory systems. When  these visual cues are removed, as they are in instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC), false sensations can cause  a pilot to quickly become disoriented.  

The vestibular system in the inner ear allows the pilot to  sense movement and determine orientation in the surrounding  environment. In both the left and right inner ear, three  semicircular canals are positioned at approximate right angles  to each other.  [Figure  $I7–3J$    Each canal is filled with fluid  and has a section full of fine hairs. Acceleration of the inner  ear in any direction causes the tiny hairs to deflect, which  in turn stimulates nerve impulses, sending messages to the  brain. The vestibular nerve transmits the impulses from  the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals to the brain to  interpret motion.  

The somatosensory system sends signals from the skin, joints,  and muscles to the brain that are interpreted in relation to the  Earth’s gravitational pull. These signals determine posture.  Inputs from each movement update the body’s position to the  brain on a constant basis. “Seat of the pants” flying is largely  dependent upon these signals. Used in conjunction with visual  and vestibular clues, these sensations can be fairly reliable.  However, the body cannot distinguish between acceleration  forces due to gravity and those resulting from maneuvering  the aircraft, which can lead to sensory illusions and false  impressions of an aircraft’s orientation and movement.  

Under normal flight conditions, when there is a visual  reference to the horizon and ground, the sensory system in the  inner ear helps to identify the pitch, roll, and yaw movements  of the aircraft. When visual contact with the horizon is lost,  the vestibular system becomes unreliable. Without visual  references outside the aircraft, there are many situations in  which combinations of normal motions and forces create  convincing illusions that are difficult to overcome.  

Prevention is usually the best remedy for spatial disorientation.  Unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight,  flight should be avoided in reduced visibility or at night when  the horizon is not visible. A pilot can reduce susceptibility  to disorienting illusions through training and awareness and  learning to rely totally on flight instruments.  

![](images/21425f248ea33c5fee18969606f1602e1bcfac939e56a56219b4f0ac61d277b0.jpg)  
Figure 17-3.   The semicircular canals lie in three planes and sense motions of roll, pitch, and yaw.  

# Vestibular Illusions  

# The Leans  

A condition called the leans, is the most common illusion  during flight and is caused by a sudden return to level flight  following a gradual and prolonged turn that went unnoticed by  the pilot. The reason a pilot can be unaware of such a gradual  turn is that human exposure to a rotational acceleration of 2  degrees per second or lower is below the detection threshold  of the semicircular canals.  [Figure 17-4]  Leveling the wings  after such a turn may cause an illusion that the aircraft is  banking in the opposite direction. In response to such an  illusion, a pilot may lean in the direction of the original turn  in a corrective attempt to regain the perception of a correct  vertical posture.  

# Coriolis Illusion  

The “coriolis illusion” occurs when a pilot has been in a turn  long enough for the fluid in the ear canal to move at the same  speed as the canal. A movement of the head in a different  plane, such as looking at something in a different part of the  flight deck, may set the fluid moving, creating the illusion  of turning or accelerating on an entirely different axis. This  action causes the pilot to think the aircraft is performing a  maneuver it is not. The disoriented pilot may maneuver the  aircraft into a dangerous attitude in an attempt to correct the  aircraft’s perceived attitude.  

For this reason, it is important that pilots develop an  instrument cross-check or scan that involves minimal head  movement. Take care when retrieving charts and other objects  in the flight deck—if something is dropped, retrieve it with  minimal head movement and be alert for the coriolis illusion.  

# Graveyard Spiral  

As in other illusions, a pilot in a prolonged coordinated,  constant-rate turn may experience the illusion of not  turning. During the recovery to level flight, the pilot will  then experience the sensation of turning in the opposite  direction causing the disoriented pilot to return the aircraft  to its original turn. Because an aircraft tends to lose altitude  in turns unless the pilot compensates for the loss in lift,  the pilot may notice a loss of altitude. The absence of any  sensation of turning creates the illusion of being in a level  descent. The pilot may pull back on the controls in an attempt  to climb or stop the descent. This action tightens the spiral  and increases the loss of altitude; this illusion is referred to  as a “graveyard spiral.”  [Figure 17-5]  This may lead to a  loss of aircraft control.  

# Somatogravic Illusion  

A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff,  stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the  head backwards. This action may create what is known as  the “somatogravic illusion” of being in a nose-up attitude,  especially in conditions with poor visual references. The  disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low or  dive attitude. A rapid deceleration by quick reduction of the  throttle(s) can have the opposite effect, with the disoriented  pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose-up or stall attitude.

# Inversion Illusion  

An abrupt change from climb to straight-and-level flight can  stimulate the otolith organs enough to create the illusion of  tumbling backwards, known as “inversion illusion.” The  disoriented pilot may push the aircraft abruptly into a nose- low attitude, which may intensify this illusion.  

# Elevator Illusion  

An abrupt upward vertical acceleration, as can occur in an  updraft, can stimulate the otolith organs to create the illusion  of being in a climb. This is known as “elevator illusion.”  The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low  attitude. An abrupt downward vertical acceleration, usually  in a downdraft, has the opposite effect with the disoriented  pilot pulling the aircraft into a nose-up attitude.  

# Visual Illusions  

Visual illusions are especially hazardous because pilots rely  on their eyes for correct information. Two illusions that lead  to spatial disorientation, false horizon and autokinesis, affect  the visual system only.  

# False Horizon  

A sloping cloud formation, an obscured horizon, an aurora  borealis, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars,  and certain geometric patterns of ground lights can provide  inaccurate visual information, or “false horizon,” when  attempting to align the aircraft with the actual horizon.  The disoriented pilots as a result may place the aircraft in a  dangerous attitude.  

Autokinesis  

When flying in the dark, a stationary light may appear to  move if it is stared at for a prolonged period of time. As  a result, a pilot may attempt to align the aircraft with the  perceived moving light potentially causing him/her to lose  control of the aircraft. This illusion is known as “autokinesis.”  

# Postural Considerations  

The postural system sends signals from the skin, joints, and  muscles to the brain that are interpreted in relation to the  Earth’s gravitational pull. These signals determine posture.  Inputs from each movement update the body’s position to  the brain on a constant basis. “Seat of the pants” flying is  largely dependent upon these signals. Used in conjunction  with visual and vestibular clues, these sensations can be  fairly reliable. However, because of the forces acting upon  the body in certain flight situations, many false sensations  can occur due to acceleration forces overpowering gravity.  [Figure 17-6]  These situations include uncoordinated turns,  climbing turns, and turbulence.  

# Demonstration of Spatial Disorientation  

There are a number of controlled aircraft maneuvers a pilot  can perform to experiment with spatial disorientation. While  each maneuver normally creates a specific illusion, any false  sensation is an effective demonstration of disorientation.  Thus, even if there is no sensation during any of these  maneuvers, the absence of sensation is still an effective  demonstration because it illustrates the inability to detect  bank or roll.  

![](images/0d4cd306b1640588fc03b335d2ebc6128e6d0c00f6c34bc337e59a17057bde04.jpg)  
Skid, slip, and uncoordinated turns feel similar.  Pilots feel they are being forced sideways in their seat.  

There are several objectives in demonstrating these various  maneuvers.  

1.	 They teach pilots to understand the susceptibility of  the human system to spatial disorientation. 2.	 They demonstrate that judgments of aircraft attitude  based on bodily sensations are frequently false. 3.	 They help decrease the occurrence and degree  of disorientation through a better understanding  of the relationship between aircraft motion, head  movements, and resulting disorientation. 4.	 They help instill a greater confidence in relying on  flight instruments for assessing true aircraft attitude.  

A pilot should not attempt any of these maneuvers at  low altitudes or in the absence of an instructor pilot or an  appropriate safety pilot.  

# Climbing While Accelerating  

With the pilot’s eyes closed, the instructor pilot maintains  approach airspeed in a straight-and-level attitude for several  seconds, then accelerates while maintaining straight-and- level attitude. The usual illusion during this maneuver,  without visual references, is that the aircraft is climbing.  

# Climbing While Turning  

With the pilot’s eyes still closed and the aircraft in a straight- and-level attitude, the instructor pilot now executes, with a  relatively slow entry, a well coordinated turn of about 1.5  positive G (approximately   $50^{\circ}$   bank) for   $90^{\circ}$  . While in the  turn, without outside visual references and under the effect of  the slight positive G, the usual illusion produced is that of a  climb. Upon sensing the climb, the pilot should immediately  open the eyes to see that a slowly established, coordinated  turn produces the same sensation as a climb.  

# Diving While Turning  

Repeating the previous procedure, but with the pilot’s  eyes should be kept closed until recovery from the turn is  approximately one-half completed, can create the illusion of  diving while turning.  

# Tilting to Right or Left  

While in a straight-and-level attitude, with the pilot’s eyes  closed, the instructor pilot executes a moderate or slight skid  to the left with wings level. This creates the illusion of the  body being tilted to the right.  

# Reversal of Motion  

This illusion can be demonstrated in any of the three planes  of motion. While straight and level, with the pilot’s eyes  closed, the instructor pilot smoothly and positively rolls the  aircraft to approximately  $45^{\circ}$   bank attitude while maintaining  heading and pitch attitude. This creates the illusion of a strong  sense of rotation in the opposite direction. After this illusion  is noted, the pilot should open his or her eyes and observe  that the aircraft is in a banked attitude.  

# Diving or Rolling Beyond the Vertical Plane  

This maneuver may produce extreme disorientation. While  in straight-and-level flight, the pilot should sit normally,  either with eyes closed or gaze lowered to the floor. The  instructor pilot starts a positive, coordinated roll toward a   $30^{\circ}$   or   $40^{\circ}$   angle of bank. As this is in progress, the pilot  tilts his or her head forward, looks to the right or left, then  immediately returns his or her head to an upright position.  The instructor pilot should time the maneuver so the roll is  stopped as the pilot returns his or her head upright. An intense  disorientation is usually produced by this maneuver, and the  pilot experiences the sensation of falling downward into the  direction of the roll.  

In the descriptions of these maneuvers, the instructor pilot is  doing the flying, but having the pilot do the flying can also  be a very effective demonstration. The pilot should close his  or her eyes and tilt the head to one side. The instructor pilot  tells the pilot what control inputs to perform. The pilot then  attempts to establish the correct attitude or control input with  eyes closed and head tilted. While it is clear the pilot has no  idea of the actual attitude, he or she will react to what the  senses are saying. After a short time, the pilot will become  disoriented and the instructor pilot will tell the pilot to look  up and recover. This exercise allows the pilot to experience  the disorientation while flying the aircraft.  

# Coping with Spatial Disorientation  

To prevent illusions and their potentially disastrous  consequences, pilots can:  

1.	 Understand the causes of these illusions and remain  constantly alert for them. Take the opportunity to  experience spatial disorientation illusions in a device,  such as a Barany chair, a Vertigon, or a Virtual Reality  Spatial Disorientation Demonstrator. 2.	 Always obtain and understand preflight weather  briefings. 3.	 Before flying in marginal visibility (less than 3 miles)  or where a visible horizon is not evident, such as flight  over open water during the night, obtain training and  maintain proficiency in aircraft control by reference  to instruments.  4.	 Do not fly into adverse weather conditions or into  dusk or darkness unless proficient in the use of flight  instruments. If intending to fly at night, maintain  

night-flight currency and proficiency. Include cross- country and local operations at various airfields. 5.	 Ensure that when outside visual references are used,  they are reliable, fixed points on the Earth’s surface. 6.	 Avoid sudden head movement, particularly during  takeoffs, turns, and approaches to landing. 7.	 Be physically tuned for flight into reduced visibility.  Ensure proper rest, adequate diet, and, if flying at  night, allow for night adaptation. Remember that  illness, medication, alcohol, fatigue, sleep loss, and  mild hypoxia are likely to increase susceptibility to  spatial disorientation. 8.	 Most importantly, become proficient in the use of  flight instruments and rely upon them. Trust the  instruments and disregard your sensory perceptions.  

The sensations that lead to illusions during instrument  flight conditions are normal perceptions experienced by  pilots. These undesirable sensations cannot be completely  prevented, but through training and awareness, pilots can  ignore or suppress them by developing absolute reliance  on the flight instruments. As pilots gain proficiency in  instrument flying, they become less susceptible to these  illusions and their effects.  

# Optical Illusions  

Of the senses, vision is the most important for safe flight.  However, various terrain features and atmospheric conditions  can create optical illusions. These illusions are primarily  associated with landing. Since pilots must transition from  reliance on instruments to visual cues outside the flight  deck for landing at the end of an instrument approach, it  is imperative that they be aware of the potential problems  associated with these illusions and take appropriate corrective  action. The major illusions leading to landing errors are  described below.  

# Runway Width Illusion  

A narrower-than-usual runway can create an illusion that the  aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is, especially  when runway length-to-width relationships are comparable.  [Figure 17-7]  The pilot who does not recognize this illusion  will fly a lower approach, with the risk of striking objects  along the approach path or landing short. A wider-than- usual runway can have the opposite effect with the risk of  the pilot leveling out the aircraft high and landing hard or  overshooting the runway.  

# Runway and Terrain Slopes Illusion  

An upsloping runway, upsloping terrain, or both can create an  illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually  is.  [Figure 17-7]  The pilot who does not recognize this  illusion will fly a lower approach. Downsloping runways and  downsloping approach terrain can have the opposite effect.  

# Featureless Terrain Illusion  

An absence of surrounding ground features, as in an  overwater approach over darkened areas or terrain made  featureless by snow, can create an illusion that the aircraft is  at a higher altitude than it actually is. This illusion, sometimes  referred to as the “black hole approach,” causes pilots to fly  a lower approach than is desired.  

# Water Refraction  

Rain on the windscreen can create an illusion of being at a  higher altitude due to the horizon appearing lower than it is.  This can result in the pilot flying a lower approach.  

# Haze  

Atmospheric haze can create an illusion of being at a greater  distance and height from the runway. As a result, the pilot  has a tendency to be low on the approach. Conversely,  extremely clear air (clear bright conditions of a high attitude  airport) can give the pilot the illusion of being closer than  he or she actually is, resulting in a high approach that may  result in an overshoot or go around. The diffusion of light  due to water particles on the windshield can adversely affect  depth perception. The lights and terrain features normally  used to gauge height during landing become less effective  for the pilot.  

# Fog  

Flying into fog can create an illusion of pitching up. Pilots  who do not recognize this illusion often steepen the approach  abruptly.  

# Ground Lighting Illusions  

Lights along a straight path, such as a road or lights on moving  trains, can be mistaken for runway and approach lights. Bright  runway and approach lighting systems, especially where  few lights illuminate the surrounding terrain, may create the  illusion of less distance to the runway. The pilot who does  not recognize this illusion will often fly a higher approach.  

# How To Prevent Landing Errors Due to Optical  Illusions  

To prevent these illusions and their potentially hazardous  consequences, pilots can:  

1.	 Anticipate the possibility of visual illusions during  approaches to unfamiliar airports, particularly at night  or in adverse weather conditions. Consult airport  

![](images/43320e94add9748cc7c1bc574e67d6d7feb3cc4aeb9df125652d67fc64b27565.jpg)  
Figure 17-7.   Runway illusions.  

# Runway width illusion  

• A narrower-than-usual runway can     create an illusion that the aircraft     is higher than it actually is, leading     to a lower approach.  

•  A wider-than-usual runway can     create an illusion that the aircraft is     lower than it actually is, leading to     a higher approach.  

# Runway slope illusion  

•  A downsloping runway can create     the illusion that the aircraft is lower     than it actually is, leading to a     higher approach.  

• An upsloping runway can create     the illusion that the aircraft is higher     than it actually is, leading to a lower     approach.

 2.	 Make frequent reference to the altimeter, especially  during all approaches, day and night.

 3.	 If possible, conduct an aerial visual inspection of  unfamiliar airports before landing.  

4.	 Use Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) or  Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) systems  for a visual reference, or an electronic glideslope,  whenever they are available. 5.	 Utilize the visual descent point (VDP) found on many  nonprecision instrument approach procedure charts.  

6.	 Recognize that the chances of being involved in an  approach accident increase when an emergency or  other activity distracts from usual procedures. 7.	 Maintain optimum proficiency in landing procedures.  

In addition to the sensory illusions due to misleading inputs to  the vestibular system, a pilot may also encounter various visual  illusions during flight. Illusions rank among the most common  factors cited as contributing to fatal aviation accidents.  

Sloping cloud formations, an obscured horizon, a dark scene  spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric  patterns of ground light can create illusions of not being  aligned correctly with the actual horizon. Various surface  features and atmospheric conditions encountered in landing  can create illusions of being on the wrong approach path.  Landing errors due to these illusions can be prevented by  anticipating them during approaches, inspecting unfamiliar  airports before landing, using electronic glideslope or VASI  systems when available, and maintaining proficiency in  landing procedures.  

# Motion Sickness  

Motion sickness, or airsickness, is caused by the brain  receiving conflicting messages about the state of the body. A  pilot may experience motion sickness during initial flights, but  it generally goes away within the first few lessons. Anxiety  and stress, which may be experienced at the beginning of  flight training, can contribute to motion sickness. Symptoms  of motion sickness include general discomfort, nausea,  dizziness, paleness, sweating, and vomiting.  

It is important to remember that experiencing airsickness is  no reflection on one’s ability as a pilot. If prone to motion  sickness, let the flight instructor know, there are techniques  that can be used to overcome this problem. For example,  avoid lessons in turbulent conditions until becoming more  comfortable in the aircraft or start with shorter flights and  graduate to longer instruction periods. If symptoms of motion  sickness are experienced during a lesson, opening fresh air  vents, focusing on objects outside the airplane, and avoiding  unnecessary head movements may help alleviate some of the  discomfort. Although medications like Dramamine can prevent  airsickness in passengers, they are not recommended while  flying since they can cause drowsiness and other problems.  

# Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning  

CO is a colorless and odorless gas produced by all internal  combustion engines. Attaching itself to the hemoglobin in  the blood about 200 times more easily than oxygen, CO  prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen to the cells,  resulting in hypemic hypoxia. The body requires up to 48  hours to dispose of CO. If severe enough, the CO poisoning  can result in death. Aircraft heater vents and defrost vents  may provide CO a passageway into the cabin, particularly if  the engine exhaust system has a leak or is damaged. If a strong  odor of exhaust gases is detected, assume that CO is present.  However, CO may be present in dangerous amounts even  if no exhaust odor is detected. Disposable, inexpensive CO  detectors are widely available. In the presence of CO, these  detectors change color to alert the pilot of the presence of CO.  Some effects of CO poisoning are headache, blurred vision,  dizziness, drowsiness, and/or loss of muscle power. Any time  a pilot smells exhaust odor, or any time these symptoms are  experienced, immediate corrective action should be taken  including turning off the heater, opening fresh air vents and  windows, and using supplemental oxygen, if available.  

Tobacco smoke also causes CO poisoning. Smoking at  sea level can raise the CO concentration in the blood and  result in physiological effects similar to flying at 8,000 feet.  Besides hypoxia, tobacco causes diseases and physiological  debilitation that can be medically disqualifying for pilots.  

# Stress  

Stress is the body’s response to physical and psychological  demands placed upon it. The body’s reaction to stress includes  releasing chemical hormones (such as adrenaline) into the  blood and increasing metabolism to provide more energy  to the muscles. Blood sugar, heart rate, respiration, blood  pressure, and perspiration all increase. The term “stressor”  is used to describe an element that causes an individual to  experience stress. Examples of stressors include physical  stress (noise or vibration), physiological stress (fatigue), and  psychological stress (difficult work or personal situations).  

Stress falls into two broad categories: acute (short term) and  chronic (long term). Acute stress involves an immediate  threat that is perceived as danger. This is the type of stress that  triggers a “fight or flight” response in an individual, whether  the threat is real or imagined. Normally, a healthy person can  cope with acute stress and prevent stress overload. However,  ongoing acute stress can develop into chronic stress.  

Chronic stress can be defined as a level of stress that presents  an intolerable burden, exceeds the ability of an individual  to cope, and causes individual performance to fall sharply.  Unrelenting psychological pressures, such as loneliness,  financial worries, and relationship or work problems can  produce a cumulative level of stress that exceeds a person’s  ability to cope with the situation. When stress reaches these  levels, performance falls off rapidly. Pilots experiencing  this level of stress are not safe and should not exercise their  airman privileges. Pilots who suspect they are suffering from  chronic stress should consult a physician.  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is frequently associated with pilot error. Some of  the effects of fatigue include degradation of attention and  concentration, impaired coordination, and decreased ability  to communicate. These factors seriously influence the  ability to make effective decisions. Physical fatigue results  from sleep loss, exercise, or physical work. Factors such as  stress and prolonged performance of cognitive work result  in mental fatigue.  

Like stress, fatigue falls into two broad categories: acute  and chronic. Acute fatigue is short term and is a normal  occurrence in everyday living. It is the kind of tiredness  people feel after a period of strenuous effort, excitement, or  lack of sleep. Rest after exertion and 8 hours of sound sleep  ordinarily cures this condition.  

A special type of acute fatigue is skill fatigue. This type of  fatigue has two main effects on performance:  

•	 Timing disruption—appearing to perform a task as  usual, but the timing of each component is slightly off.  This makes the pattern of the operation less smooth  because the pilot performs each component as though it  were separate, instead of part of an integrated activity. •	 Disruption of the perceptual field—concentrating  attention upon movements or objects in the center of  vision and neglecting those in the periphery. This is  accompanied by loss of accuracy and smoothness in  control movements.  

Acute fatigue has many causes, but the following are among  the most important for the pilot:  

•	 Mild hypoxia (oxygen deficiency) •	 Physical stress •	 Psychological stress •	 Depletion of physical energy resulting from  psychological stress  •	 Sustained psychological stress  

Sustained psychological stress accelerates the glandular  secretions that prepare the body for quick reactions during  an emergency. These secretions make the circulatory and  respiratory systems work harder, and the liver releases energy  to provide the extra fuel needed for brain and muscle work.  When this reserve energy supply is depleted, the body lapses  into generalized and severe fatigue.  

Acute fatigue can be prevented by proper diet and adequate  rest and sleep. A well-balanced diet prevents the body from  needing to consume its own tissues as an energy source.  Adequate rest maintains the body’s store of vital energy.  

Chronic fatigue, extending over a long period of time, usually  has psychological roots, although an underlying disease is  sometimes responsible. Continuous high-stress levels produce  chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue is not relieved by proper diet  and adequate rest and sleep and usually requires treatment  by a physician. An individual may experience this condition  in the form of weakness, tiredness, palpitations of the heart,  breathlessness, headaches, or irritability. Sometimes chronic  fatigue even creates stomach or intestinal problems and  generalized aches and pains throughout the body. When the  condition becomes serious enough, it leads to emotional illness.  

If suffering from acute fatigue, stay on the ground. If fatigue  occurs in the flight deck, no amount of training or experience  can overcome the detrimental effects. Getting adequate rest  is the only way to prevent fatigue from occurring. Avoid  flying without a full night’s rest, after working excessive  hours, or after an especially exhausting or stressful day. Pilots  who suspect they are suffering from chronic fatigue should  consult a physician.  

# Exposure to Chemicals  

When conducting preflight and post-flight inspections, pilots  must verify that the fluid levels in their aircraft meet the  levels specified for safe operations as stated in the Pilot's  Operating Handbook. These fluids include, but are not limited  to hydraulic fluid, engine oil, and fuel.  

It is important that every pilot recognize the potential hazards  of working with these fluids as well as the recommended first  aid measures to follow should any of these fluids come in  contact with their eyes, skin, and/or respiratory system. As  the specific first aid measures for dealing with exposure to  these chemicals can vary by chemical type, it is important that  every pilot be familiar with the location and use of the Material  Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each chemical they encounter.  

The procedures described in the following sections are  minimum guideline for first aid for each of the indicated  scenarios. Ultimately, the pilot should consult the MSDS  for first aid procedures specific to the type of chemical and  exposure scenario.  

# Hydraulic Fluid  

•	 Eye Contact—immediately flush the eyes with clean  water and seek medical attention if irritation occurs. •	 Skin Contact—remove all contaminated clothing and  thoroughly cleanse the affected areas with mild soap  and water or a waterless hand cleaner. If irritation or  redness develops and persists, seek medical attention.  Should the hydraulic fluid get into or under the skin,  or into any other part of the body, regardless of the  

appearance of the wound or its size, seek medical  attention immediately.

 •	 Inhalation—if respiratory symptoms develop, move  away from the source of exposure and into fresh air  in a position comfortable for breathing. If symptoms  persist, seek medical attention.

 •	 Ingestion—first aid is not normally required; however,  if swallowed and symptoms develop, seek medical  attention.  

# Engine Oil  

•	 Eye Contact—immediately flush the eyes with clean  water and seek medical attention if irritation occurs.

 •	 Skin Contact—remove all contaminated clothing and  thoroughly cleanse the affected areas with soap and  water. Launder contaminated clothing before reuse.

 •	 Inhalation—move away from the source of exposure  and into fresh air. If respiratory irritation, dizziness,  nausea, or unconsciousness occurs, seek immediate  medical attention. If breathing stops, assisted  ventilation is required via a bag-valve-mask or  cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

 •	 Ingestion—seek immediate medical attention. If  immediate medical attention is not available, contact  a regional poison control center or emergency medical  professional regarding the induction of vomiting or  use of activated charcoal. Vomiting should never be  induced to a person who is groggy or unconscious.  

# Fuel  

•	 Eye Contact—immediately flush the eyes with  clean water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical  attention immediately.

 •	 Skin Contact—remove all contaminated clothing  and thoroughly cleanse the affected areas with mild  soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner. If skin  surface is damaged, apply a clean dressing and seek  medical attention. If irritation or redness develops,  seek medical attention. Launder contaminated clothing  before reuse.

 •	 Inhalation—move away from the source of exposure  and into fresh air. If breathing stops, assisted  ventilation is required via a bag-valve-mask or  cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Once breathing  is restored, the use of additional oxygen may be  necessary. Seek medical attention immediately.

 •	 Ingestion—seek immediate medical attention. Do not  induce vomiting or take anything by mouth as this may  cause the material to enter the lungs and cause severe  lung damage. Should vomiting occur, keep head below  the hips to reduce the risks of aspiration. Monitor for  breathing difficulties. Rinse out any material which  enters the mouth until the taste is dissipated.  

# Dehydration and Heatstroke  

Dehydration is the term given to a critical loss of water from  the body. Causes of dehydration are hot flight decks and  flight lines, wind, humidity, and diuretic drinks—coffee, tea,  alcohol, and caffeinated soft drinks. Some common signs of  dehydration are headache, fatigue, cramps, sleepiness, and  dizziness.  

The first noticeable effect of dehydration is fatigue, which  in turn makes top physical and mental performance difficult,  if not impossible. Flying for long periods in hot summer  temperatures or at high altitudes increases the susceptibility  to dehydration because these conditions tend to increase the  rate of water loss from the body.  

To help prevent dehydration, drink two to four quarts of  water every 24 hours. Since each person is physiologically  different, this is only a guide. Most people are aware of the  eight-glasses-a-day guide: If each glass of water is eight  ounces, this equates to 64 ounces, which is two quarts. If  this fluid is not replaced, fatigue progresses to dizziness,  weakness, nausea, tingling of hands and feet, abdominal  cramps, and extreme thirst.  

The key for pilots is to be continually aware of their condition.  Most people become thirsty with a 1.5 quart deficit or a loss  of 2 percent of total body weight. This level of dehydration  triggers the “thirst mechanism.” The problem is that the thirst  mechanism arrives too late and is turned off too easily. A  small amount of fluid in the mouth turns this mechanism off  and the replacement of needed body fluid is delayed.  

Other steps to prevent dehydration include:  

•	 Carrying a container in order to measure daily water  intake. •	 Staying ahead—not relying on the thirst sensation as  an alarm. If plain water is not preferred, add some  sport drink flavoring to make it more acceptable. •	 Limiting daily intake of caffeine and alcohol (both are  diuretics and stimulate increased production of urine).  

Heatstroke is a condition caused by any inability of the body  to control its temperature. Onset of this condition may be  recognized by the symptoms of dehydration, but also has  been known to be recognized only upon complete collapse.  

To prevent these symptoms, it is recommended that an  ample supply of water be carried and used at frequent  intervals on any long flight, whether thirsty or not. The body  normally absorbs water at a rate of 1.2 to 1.5 quarts per hour.  Individuals should drink one quart per hour for severe heat  stress conditions or one pint per hour for moderate stress  conditions. If the aircraft has a canopy or roof window,  wearing light-colored, porous clothing and a hat will help  provide protection from the sun. Keeping the flight deck well  ventilated aids in dissipating excess heat.  

# Alcohol  

Alcohol impairs the efficiency of the human body.  [Figure 17-8]  Studies have shown that consuming alcohol  is closely linked to performance deterioration. Pilots must  make hundreds of decisions, some of them time-critical,  during the course of a flight. The safe outcome of any flight  depends on the ability to make the correct decisions and take  

![Figure 17-8.   Impairment scale with alcohol use. ](images/4dbf011baa28296c2ef7c01171390848bda43a653e3363d588aa43b255ead6d4.jpg)  

the appropriate actions during routine occurrences, as well  as abnormal situations. The influence of alcohol drastically  reduces the chances of completing a flight without incident.  Even in small amounts, alcohol can impair judgment,  decrease sense of responsibility, affect coordination, constrict  visual field, diminish memory, reduce reasoning ability, and  lower attention span. As little as one ounce of alcohol can  decrease the speed and strength of muscular reflexes, lessen  the efficiency of eye movements while reading, and increase  the frequency at which errors are committed. Impairments  in vision and hearing can occur from consuming as little as  one drink.  

The alcohol consumed in beer and mixed drinks is ethyl  alcohol, a central nervous system depressant. From a medical  point of view, it acts on the body much like a general  anesthetic. The “dose” is generally much lower and more  slowly consumed in the case of alcohol, but the basic effects  on the human body are similar. Alcohol is easily and quickly  absorbed by the digestive tract. The bloodstream absorbs  about 80 to 90 percent of the alcohol in a drink within 30  minutes when ingested on an empty stomach. The body  requires about 3 hours to rid itself of all the alcohol contained  in one mixed drink or one beer.  

While experiencing a hangover, a pilot is still under the  influence of alcohol. Although a pilot may think he or she is  functioning normally, motor and mental response impairment  is still present. Considerable amounts of alcohol can remain  in the body for over 16 hours, so pilots should be cautious  about flying too soon after drinking.  

Altitude multiplies the effects of alcohol on the brain. When  combined with altitude, the alcohol from two drinks may have  the same effect as three or four drinks. Alcohol interferes  with the brain’s ability to utilize oxygen, producing a form  of histotoxic hypoxia. The effects are rapid because alcohol  passes quickly into the bloodstream. In addition, the brain  is a highly vascular organ that is immediately sensitive to  changes in the blood’s composition. For a pilot, the lower  oxygen availability at altitude and the lower capability of  the brain to use the oxygen that is available can add up to a  deadly combination.  

Intoxication is determined by the amount of alcohol in the  bloodstream. This is usually measured as a percentage by  weight in the blood. 14 CFR part 91 requires that blood  alcohol level be less than .04 percent and that 8 hours pass  between drinking alcohol and piloting an aircraft. A pilot with  a blood alcohol level of .04 percent or greater after 8 hours  cannot fly until the blood alcohol falls below that amount.  Even though blood alcohol may be well below .04 percent,  a pilot cannot fly sooner than 8 hours after drinking alcohol.  

Although the regulations are quite specific, it is a good idea  to be more conservative than the regulations.  

# Drugs  

The Federal Aviation Regulations include no specific  references to medication usage. Two regulations, though,  are important to keep in mind. Title 14 of the CFR part 61,  section 61.53 prohibits acting as pilot-in-command or in any  other capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember, while  that person:  

1.	 Knows or has reason to know of any medical condition that would make the person unable to meet the requirement for the medical certificate necessary for the pilot operation, or 2.	 Is taking medication or receiving other treatment for a medical condition that results in the person being unable to meet the requirements for the medical certificate necessary for the pilot operation.  

Further, 14 CFR part 91, section 91.17 prohibits the use  of any drug that affects the person’s faculties in any way  contrary to safety.  

There are several thousand medications currently approved  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), not  including OTC (over the counter) drugs. Virtually all  medications have the potential for adverse side effects in  some people. Additionally, herbal and dietary supplements,  sport and energy boosters, and some other “natural” products  are derived from substances often found in medications that  could also have adverse side effects. While some individuals  experience no side effects with a particular drug or product,  others may be noticeably affected. The FAA regularly  reviews FDA and other data to assure that medications found  acceptable for aviation duties do not pose an adverse safety  risk. Drugs that cause no apparent side effects on the ground  can create serious problems at even relatively low altitudes.  Even at typical general aviation altitudes, the changes in  concentrations of atmospheric gases in the blood can enhance  the effects of seemingly innocuous drugs that can result in  impaired judgment, decision-making, and performance. In  addition, fatigue, stress, dehydration, and inadequate nutrition  can increase an airman’s susceptibility to adverse effects from  various drugs, even if they appeared to tolerate them in the  past. If multiple medications are being taken at the same time,  the adverse effects can be even more pronounced.  

Another important consideration is that the medical  condition for which a medication is prescribed may itself be  disqualifying. The FAA will consider the condition in the  context of risk for medical incapacitation, and the medication as well for cognitive impairment, and either or both could be  found unacceptable for medical certification.  

Some of the most commonly used OTC drugs, antihistamines  and decongestants, have the potential to cause noticeable  adverse side effects, including drowsiness and cognitive  deficits. The symptoms associated with common  upper respiratory infections, including the common  cold, often suppress a pilot’s desire to fly, and treating  symptoms with a drug that causes adverse side effects  only  compounds  the  problem.  Particularly,  medications  containing  diphenhydramine  (e.g.,  Benadryl) are known to cause drowsiness and have a  prolonged half-life, meaning the drugs stay in one’s system  for an extended time, which lengthens the time that side  effects are present.  

Many medications, such as tranquilizers, sedatives, strong  pain relievers, and cough suppressants, have primary  effects that may impair judgment, memory, alertness,  coordination, vision, and the ability to make calculations.  [Figure 17-9]  Others, such as antihistamines, blood pressure  drugs, muscle relaxants, and agents to control diarrhea and  motion sickness, have side effects that may impair the same  critical functions. Any medication that depresses the nervous  system, such as a sedative, tranquilizer, or antihistamine, can  make a pilot more susceptible to hypoxia.  

Painkillers are grouped into two broad categories: analgesics  and anesthetics. Analgesics are drugs that reduce pain,  while anesthetics are drugs that deaden pain or cause loss  of consciousness.  

Over-the-counter analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic  acid (aspirin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and ibuprofen  (Advil), have few side effects when taken in the  correct dosage. Although some people are allergic to certain  analgesics or may suffer from stomach irritation, flying  usually is not restricted when taking these drugs. However,  flying is almost always precluded while using prescription  analgesics, such as drugs containing propoxyphene (e.g.,  Darvon), oxycodone (e.g., Percodan), meperidine (e.g.,  Demerol), and codeine, since these drugs are known to  cause side effects, such as mental confusion, dizziness,  headaches, nausea, and vision problems.  

Anesthetic drugs are commonly used for dental and surgical  procedures. Most local anesthetics used for minor dental and  outpatient procedures wear off within a relatively short period  of time. The anesthetic itself may not limit flying as much  as the actual procedure and subsequent pain.  

There is evidence taking illicit drugs significantly elevates  the risk of having an aviation accident.  Even though the  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (DEA)  defines  marijuana as a Schedule I drug on its controlled substances  list, states have taken steps to allow the possession, sale,  

and use of marijuana withing their border. The  F A A has stated, "Marijuana is an illicit drug per  federal law and its use by airmen is prohibited."  

Stimulants are drugs that excite the central nervous  system and produce an increase in alertness and activity.  Amphetamines, caffeine, and nicotine are all forms of  stimulants. Common uses of these drugs include appetite  suppression, fatigue reduction, and mood elevation. Some  of these drugs may cause a stimulant reaction, even though this reaction is not their primary function. In some cases,  stimulants can produce anxiety and mood swings, both of  which are dangerous when flying.  

Depressants are drugs that reduce the body’s functioning in  many areas. These drugs lower blood pressure, reduce mental  processing, and slow motor and reaction responses. There are  several types of drugs that can cause a depressing effect on the  body, including tranquilizers, motion sickness medication,  some types of stomach medication, decongestants, and  antihistamines. The most common depressant is alcohol.  

![Figure 17-9.   Adverse affects of various drugs. ](images/5c77f517e8500778682ab4549c5faff0ae4492ac390c090518bda14786cca058.jpg)  

Some drugs that are classified as neither stimulants nor  depressants have adverse effects on flying. For example,  some antibiotics can produce dangerous side effects, such  as balance disorders, hearing loss, nausea, and vomiting.  While many antibiotics are safe for use while flying, the  infection requiring the antibiotic may prohibit flying. In  addition, unless specifically prescribed by a physician, do  not take more than one drug at a time, and never mix drugs  with alcohol because the effects are often unpredictable.  

The dangers of illegal drugs also are well documented.  Certain illegal drugs can have hallucinatory effects that occur  days or weeks after the drug is taken. Obviously, these drugs  have no place in the aviation community.  

14 CFR prohibits pilots from performing crewmember  duties while using any medication that affects the body in  any way contrary to safety. The safest rule is not to fly as a  crewmember while taking any medication, unless approved to  do so by the FAA. If there is any doubt regarding the effects  of any medication, consult an AME before flying.  

Prior to each and every flight, all pilots must do a proper  physical self-assessment to ensure safety. A great mnemonic,  covered in Chapter 2 on Aeronautical Decision-Making,  is IMSAFE, which stands for Illness, Medication, Stress,  Alcohol, Fatigue, and Emotion.  

For the medication component of IMSAFE, pilots need to  ask themselves, “Am I taking any medicines that might affect  my judgment or make me drowsy? For any new medication,  OTC or prescribed, you should wait at least 48 hours after  the first dose before flying to determine you do not have any  adverse side effects that would make it unsafe to operate an  aircraft. In addition to medication questions, pilots should  also consider the following –  

•	 Do not take any unnecessary or elective medications; •	 Make sure you eat regular balanced meals; •	 Bring a snack for both you and your passengers for the flight; •	 Maintain good hydration - bring plenty of water; •	 Ensure adequate sleep the night prior to the flight; and •	 Stay physically fit.  

Additionally, you should wait at least five maximal dosing  intervals, the time between recommended or prescribed  dosing, (e.g., a dosing interval of 5 to 6 hours would require  you to wait 30 hours) before flying after taking any medication  that has potentially adverse side effects (e.g., sedating or  dizziness). Observing the recommended dosing interval  doesn’t eliminate the risk for adverse side effects because  everyone metabolizes medications differently. However,  five times the dosing interval is a reasonable rule of thumb.  

# Altitude-Induced Decompression Sickness (DCS)  

Decompression sickness (DCS) describes a condition  characterized by a variety of symptoms resulting from  exposure to low barometric pressures that cause inert gases  (mainly nitrogen), normally dissolved in body fluids and  tissues, to come out of physical solution and form bubbles.  Nitrogen is an inert gas normally stored throughout the  human body (tissues and fluids) in physical solution. When  the body is exposed to decreased barometric pressures (as in  flying an unpressurized aircraft to altitude or during a rapid  decompression), the nitrogen dissolved in the body comes out  of solution. If the nitrogen is forced to leave the solution too  rapidly, bubbles form in different areas of the body causing a  variety of signs and symptoms. The most common symptom  is joint pain, which is known as “the bends.”  [Figure 17-10]  

What to do when altitude-induced DCS occurs:  

•	 Put on oxygen mask immediately and switch the regulator to 100 percent oxygen. •	 Begin an emergency descent and land as soon as possible. Even if the symptoms disappear during descent, land and seek medical evaluation while continuing to breathe oxygen. •	 If one of the symptoms is joint pain, keep the affected  area still; do not try to work pain out by moving the joint around. •	 Upon landing, seek medical assistance from an FAA medical officer, AME, military flight surgeon, or a hyperbaric medicine specialist. Be aware that a physician not specialized in aviation or hypobaric medicine may not be familiar with this type of medical  problem. •	 Definitive medical treatment may involve the use of a hyperbaric chamber operated by specially-trained personnel. •	 Delayed signs and symptoms of altitude-induced DCS can occur after return to ground level regardless of presence during flight.  

# DCS After Scuba Diving  

Scuba diving subjects the body to increased pressure, which  allows more nitrogen to dissolve in body tissues and fluids.  [Figure 17-11]  The reduction of atmospheric pressure that  accompanies flying can produce physical problems for scuba  divers. A pilot or passenger who intends to fly after scuba  diving should allow the body sufficient time to rid itself of  excess nitrogen absorbed during diving. If not, DCS due to  

![Figure 17-10.   Signs and symptoms of altitude decompression sickness. ](images/7ce3b06b7c0af9a86596287f5cc7628d9175812a624ab2b69b28f577d35d9039.jpg)  

evolved gas can occur during exposure to low altitude and  create a serious inflight emergency.  

The recommended waiting time before going to flight  altitudes of up to 8,000 feet is at least 12 hours after diving  that does not require controlled ascent (non decompression  stop diving), and at least 24 hours after diving that does  require controlled ascent (decompression stop diving). The  waiting time before going to flight altitudes above 8,000  feet should be at least 24 hours after any scuba dive. These  recommended altitudes are actual flight altitudes above  mean sea level (MSL) and not pressurized cabin altitudes.  This takes into consideration the risk of decompression of  the aircraft during flight.  

# Vision in Flight  

Of all the senses, vision is the most important for safe flight.  Most of the things perceived while flying are visual or heavily  supplemented by vision. As remarkable and vital as it is,  vision is subject to limitations, such as illusions and blind  spots. The more a pilot understands about the eyes and how  they function, the easier it is to use vision effectively and  compensate for potential problems.  

The eye functions much like a camera. Its structure includes  an aperture, a lens, a mechanism for focusing, and a surface  for registering images. Light enters through the cornea at the  front of the eyeball, travels through the lens, and falls on the  retina. The retina contains light sensitive cells that convert  

![](images/eb8aed6efb91633e50f7e5d6d2966cbfbc94c1a3763b3546415ccd7f3cc503f6.jpg)  
Figure 17-11.   To avoid the bends, scuba divers must not fly for  specific time periods following dives.  

![](images/cced91324dbb4e7940f18c1690001ce4adc4e817ebee0a1deaa833380b468014.jpg)  
Figure 17-12.   The human eye.  

light energy into electrical impulses that travel through nerves  to the brain. The brain interprets the electrical signals to form  images. There are two kinds of light-sensitive cells in the  eyes: rods and cones.  [Figure 17-12]  

The cones are responsible for all color vision, from  appreciating a glorious sunset to discerning the subtle shades  in a fine painting. Cones are present throughout the retina, but  are concentrated toward the center of the field of vision at the  back of the retina. There is a small pit called the fovea where  almost all the light sensing cells are cones. This is the area  where most “looking” occurs (the center of the visual field  where detail, color sensitivity, and resolution are highest).  

that a large amount of light overwhelms them, and they take  longer to “reset” and adapt to the dark again. There are so  many cones in the fovea that are at the very center of the  visual field but virtually has no rods at all. So in low light,  the middle of the visual field is not very sensitive, but farther  from the fovea, the rods are more numerous and provide the  major portion of night vision.  

# Vision Types  

There are three types of vision: photopic, mesopic, and  scotopic. Each type functions under different sensory stimuli  or ambient light conditions.  [Figure 17-13]  

# Photopic Vision  

While the cones and their associated nerves are well suited  to detecting fine detail and color in high light levels, the  rods are better able to detect movement and provide vision  in dim light. The rods are unable to discern color but are  very sensitive at low-light levels. The trouble with rods is  Photopic vision provides the capability for seeing color and  resolving fine detail (20/20 or better), but it functions only  in good illumination. Photopic vision is experienced during  daylight or when a high level of artificial illumination exists.  

![Figure 17-13.   Types of vision. ](images/69049cdeaad9dadd56786f498f5b12b9848e4ad8964bebfabe761d477c5d4cd4.jpg)  

The cones concentrated in the fovea centralis of the eye are  primarily responsible for vision in bright light.  [Figure 17-12 ]  Because of the high light level, rhodopsin, which is a  biological pigment of the retina that is responsible for both  the formation of the photoreceptor cells and the first events  in the perception of light, is bleached out causing the rod  cells to become less effective.  

# Mesopic Vision  

Mesopic vision is achieved by a combination of rods and  cones and is experienced at dawn, dusk, and during full  moonlight. Visual acuity steadily decreases as available light  decreases and color perception changes because the cones  become less effective. Mesopic viewing period is considered  the most dangerous period for viewing. As cone sensitivity  decreases, pilots should use off-center vision and proper  scanning techniques to detect objects during low-light levels.  

# Scotopic Vision  

Scotopic vision is experienced under low-light levels and  the cones become ineffective, resulting in poor resolution of  detail. Visual acuity decreases to 20/200 or less and enables  a person to see only objects the size of or larger than the  big “E” on visual acuity testing charts from 20 feet away.  In other words, a person must stand at 20 feet to see what  can normally be seen at 200 feet under daylight conditions.  When using scotopic vision, color perception is lost and a  night blind spot in the central field of view appears at low  light levels when the cone-cell sensitivity is lost.  

# Central Blind Spot  

The area where the optic nerve connects to the retina in the  back of each eye is known as the optic disk. There is a total  absence of cones and rods in this area, and consequently,  each eye is completely blind in this spot.  [Figure 17-14] As a result, it is referred to as the blind spot that everyone  

![](images/02ddfea02534fa03b89509d0619cbd8df93bb287ffeed2e48243626197edb134.jpg)  
Figure 17-14.   Central blind spot.  

has in each eye. Under normal binocular vision conditions  (both eyes are used together), this is not a problem because  an object cannot be in the blind spot of both eyes at the same  time. On the other hand, where the field of vision of one eye  is obstructed by an object (windshield divider or another  aircraft), a visual target could fall in the blind spot of the  other eye and remain undetected.  

Figure 17-15  provides a dramatic example of the eye’s  blind spot.  

1.	 Hold this page at an arm’s length.  2.	 Completely cover your left eye (without closing or  pressing on it) using your hand or other flat object.  3.	 With your right eye, stare directly at the airplane on  the left side of the picture page. In your periphery, you  will notice the black X on the right side of the picture.  4.	 Slowly move the page closer to you while continuing  to stare at the airplane.  

![](images/41b37b5d701f9376172369b96af8cb22a62d734e7d167275ce0edb29153245a2.jpg)  
Figure 17-15.   The eye’s blind spot.  

5.	 When the page is about 16–18 inches from you, the  black X should disappear completely because it has  been imaged onto the blind spot of your right eye.  (Resist the temptation to move your right eye while  the black X is gone or else it reappears. Keep staring  at the airplane.)  6.	 As you continue to look at the airplane, keep moving  the page closer to you a few more inches, and the black  X will come back into view.  7.	 There is an interval where you are able to move the  page a few inches backward and forward, and the black  X will be gone. This demonstrates to you the extent  of your blind spot.  8.	 You can try the same thing again, except this time with  your right eye covered stare at the black X with your  left eye. Move the page in closer and the airplane will  disappear.  

![](images/f543906dc3b59dcbec550f27c2866075c444a11a1e7bc8db44eff1cc88416442.jpg)  
Figure 17-16.   Night vision.  

expose the rods to the image. This can be done by looking  $5^{\circ}$  to  $10^{\circ}$   off center of the object to be seen. This can be tried in  a dim light in a darkened room. When looking directly at the  light, it dims or disappears altogether. When looking slightly  off center, it becomes clearer and brighter.  

Another way to check your blind spot is to do a similar test  outside at night when there is a full moon. Cover your left  eye, looking at the full moon with your right eye. Gradually  move your right eye to the left (and maybe slightly up or  down). Before long, all you will be able to see is the large  halo around the full moon; the entire moon itself will seem  to have disappeared.  

When looking directly at an object, the image is focused  mainly on the fovea, where detail is best seen. At night, the  ability to see an object in the center of the visual field is  reduced as the cones lose much of their sensitivity and the  rods become more sensitive. Looking off center can help  compensate for this night blind spot. Along with the loss of  

# Empty-Field Myopia  

![](images/afa24643d4461948e4147a3b8b6f662126af539005fde55c2a604f1fa2efae9c.jpg)  
Figure 17-17.   Night blind spot.  

Empty-field myopia is a condition that usually occurs when  flying above the clouds or in a haze layer that provides  nothing specific to focus on outside the aircraft. This causes  the eyes to relax and seek a comfortable focal distance that  may range from 10 to 30 feet. For the pilot, this means  looking without seeing, which is dangerous. Searching out  and focusing on distant light sources, no matter how dim,  helps prevent the onset of empty-field myopia.  

# Night Vision  

There are many good reasons to fly at night, but pilots must  keep in mind that the risks of night flying are different than  during the day and often times higher.  [Figure 17-16]  Pilots  who are cautious and educated on night-flying techniques  can mitigate those risks and become very comfortable and  proficient in the task.  

# Night Blind Spot  

It is estimated that once fully adapted to darkness, the rods are  10,000 times more sensitive to light than the cones, making  them the primary receptors for night vision. Since the cones  are concentrated near the fovea, the rods are also responsible  for much of the peripheral vision. The concentration of cones  in the fovea can make a night blind spot in the center of the  field of vision. To see an object clearly at night, the pilot must  

sharpness (acuity) and color at night, depth perception and  judgment of size may be lost.  [Figure 17-17]  

# Dark Adaptation  

Dark adaptation is the adjustment of the human eye to a dark  environment. That adjustment takes longer depending on the  amount of light in the environment that a person has just left.  Moving from a bright room into a dark one takes longer than  moving from a dim room and going into a dark one.  

While the cones adapt rapidly to changes in light intensities,  the rods take much longer. Walking from bright sunlight into  a dark movie theater is an example of this dark adaptation  period experience. The rods can take approximately 30  minutes to fully adapt to darkness. A bright light, however,  can completely destroy night adaptation, leaving night  vision severely compromised while the adaptation process  is repeated.  

# Scanning Techniques  

Scanning techniques are very important in identifying objects  at night. To scan effectively, pilots must look from right to  left or left to right. They should begin scanning at the greatest  distance an object can be perceived (top) and move inward  toward the position of the aircraft (bottom). For each stop, an  area approximately  $30^{\circ}$   wide should be scanned. The duration  of each stop is based on the degree of detail that is required,  but no stop should last longer than 2 to 3 seconds. When  moving from one viewing point to the next, pilots should  overlap the previous field of view by   $10^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 17-18]  

Off-center viewing is another type of scan that pilots can use  during night flying. It is a technique that requires an object be  viewed by looking  $10^{\circ}$   above, below, or to either side of the  object.  [Figure 17-19]  In this manner, the peripheral vision  can maintain contact with an object.  

With off-center vision, the images of an object viewed longer  than 2 to 3 seconds will disappear. This occurs because the  rods reach a photochemical equilibrium that prevents any  further response until the scene changes. This produces  a potentially unsafe operating condition. To overcome  this night vision limitation, pilots must be aware of the  phenomenon and avoid viewing an object for longer than 2  or 3 seconds. The peripheral field of vision will continue to  pick up the object when the eyes are shifted from one off- center point to another.  

# Night Vision Protection  

Several things can be done to help with the dark adaptation  process and to keep the eyes adapted to darkness. Some of  the steps pilots and flight crews can take to protect their night  vision are described in the following paragraphs.  

![](images/d114d55cb9405df16b817400abfd4af6ed7199101aab446f3f53048c441381df.jpg)

Figure 17-19.   Off-center viewing.  

# Sunglasses  

If a night flight is scheduled, pilots and crew members should  wear neutral density (N-15) sunglasses or equivalent filter  lenses when exposed to bright sunlight. This precaution  increases the rate of dark adaptation at night and improves  night visual sensitivity.  

# Oxygen Supply  

Unaided night vision depends on optimum function and  sensitivity of the rods of the retina. Lack of oxygen to the rods  (hypoxia) significantly reduces their sensitivity. Sharp clear  vision (with the best being equal to 20–20 vision) requires  significant oxygen especially at night. Without supplemental  oxygen, an individual’s night vision declines measurably at  pressure altitudes above 4,000 feet. As altitude increases,  the available oxygen decreases, degrading night vision.  Compounding the problem is fatigue, which minimizes  physiological well being. Adding fatigue to high altitude  exposure is a recipe for disaster. In fact, if flying at night at  an altitude of 12,000 feet, the pilot may actually see elements  of his or her normal vision missing or not in focus. Missing  visual elements resemble the missing pixels in a digital image  while unfocused vision is dim and washed out.  

For the pilot suffering the effects of hypoxic hypoxia, a simple  descent to a lower altitude may not be sufficient to reestablish  vision. For example, a climb from 8,000 feet to 12,000 feet for  30 minutes does not mean a descent to 8,000 feet will rectify  the problem. Visual acuity may not be regained for over an  hour. Thus, it is important to remember, altitude and fatigue  have a profound effect on a pilot’s ability to see.  

# High Intensity Lighting  

If, during the flight, any high intensity lighting areas are  encountered, attempt to turn the aircraft away and fly in the  periphery of the lighted area. This will not expose the eyes to  such a large amount of light all at once. If possible, plan your  route to avoid direct over flight of built-up, brightly lit areas.  

# Flightdeck Lighting  

Flightdeck lighting should be kept as low as possible so that  the light does not monopolize night vision. After reaching  the desired flight altitude, pilots should allow time to  adjust to the flight conditions. This includes readjustment  of instrument lights and orientation to outside references.  During the adjustment period, night vision should continue  to improve until optimum night adaptation is achieved. When  it is necessary to read maps, charts, and checklists, use a dim  white light flashlight and avoid shining it in your or any other  crewmember’s eyes.  

# Airfield Precautions  

Often time, pilots have no say in how airfield operations are  handled, but listed below are some precautions that can be  taken to make night flying safer and help protect night vision.  

•	 Airfield lighting should be reduced to the lowest  usable intensity.  •	 Maintenance personnel should practice light discipline  with headlights and flashlights. •	 Position the aircraft at a part of the airfield where the  least amount of lighting exists.  

•	 Select approach and departure routes that avoid  highways and residential areas where illumination  can impair night vision.  

# Self-Imposed Stress  

Night flight can be more fatiguing and stressful than day  flight, and many self- imposed stressors can limit night vision.  Pilots can control this type of stress by knowing the factors  that can cause self-imposed stressors. Some of these factors  are listed in the following paragraphs.  [Figure 17-20]  

Drugs  

Drugs can seriously degrade visual acuity during the day and  especially at night. Pilots who become ill should consult an  aviation medical examiner (AME) or flight surgeon as to  which drugs are appropriate to take while flying.  

Exhaustion  

Pilots who become fatigued during a night flight will not be  mentally alert and will respond more slowly to situations  requiring immediate action. Exhausted pilots tend to  concentrate on one aspect of a situation without considering  the total requirement. Their performance may become a  safety hazard depending on the degree of fatigue and instead  of using proper scanning techniques may get fixated on the  instruments or stare off rather than multitask.  

# Poor Physical Conditioning  

To overcome poor physical conditioning, pilots should  participate in regular exercise programs. People who are  physically fit become less fatigued during flight and have  better night scanning efficiency. However, too much exercise  in a given day may leave crew members too fatigued for  night flying.  

Alcohol  

Alcohol is a sedative and its use impairs both coordination  and judgment. As a result, pilots who are impaired by alcohol  fail to apply the proper techniques of night vision. They are  likely to stare at objects and to neglect scanning techniques.  The amount of alcohol consumed determines the degree to  which night vision is affected. The effects of alcohol are long  lasting and the residual effects of alcohol can also impair  visual scanning efficiency.  

# Tobacco  

Of all the self-imposed stressors, cigarette smoking most  decreases visual sensitivity at night. Smoking significantly  increases the amount of carbon monoxide carried by the  hemoglobin in red blood cells. This reduces the blood’s  capacity to combine with oxygen, so less oxygen is carried  in the blood. Hypoxia caused by carbon monoxide poisoning  

![](images/6801c3c1e59ad37393dde73ab4ca1fe24b976ab34eadacbbf59eda5c6765a3e3.jpg)  
Figure 17-20.   Self-imposed stress.  

affects peripheral vision and dark adaptation. The results  are the same as those for hypoxia caused by high altitude.  Smoking 3 cigarettes in rapid succession or 20 to 30 cigarettes  within a 24-hour period may saturate from 8 to 10 percent  of the capacity of hemoglobin. Smokers lose 20 percent of  their night vision capability at sea level, which is equal to a  physiological altitude of 5,000 feet.  

# Hypoglycemia and Nutritional Deficiency  

Missing or postponing meals can cause low blood sugar,  which impairs night flight performance. Low blood sugar  levels may result in stomach contractions, distraction,  breakdown in habit pattern, and a shortened attention span.  Likewise, an insufficient consumption of vitamin A may  also impair night vision. Foods high in vitamin A include  eggs, butter, cheese, liver, apricots, peaches, carrots, squash,  spinach, peas, and most types of greens. High quantities of  vitamin A do not increase night vision but a lack of vitamin  A certainly impairs it.  

# Distance Estimation and Depth Perception  

Knowledge of the mechanisms and cues affecting distance  estimation and depth perception assist pilots in judging  distances at night. These cues may be monocular or binocular.  The monocular cues that aid in distance estimation and depth  perception include motion parallax, geometric perspective,  retinal image size, and aerial perspective.  

# Motion Parallax  

Motion parallax refers to the apparent motion of stationary  objects as viewed by an observer moving across the  landscape. When the pilot or crewmember looks outside the  aircraft perpendicular to the direction of travel, near objects  appear to move backward, past, or opposite the path of  motion; far objects seem to move in the direction of motion  or remain fixed. The rate of apparent movement depends on  the distance the observer is from the object.  

# Geometric Perspective  

An object may appear to have a different shape when viewed  at varying distances and from different angles. Geometric  perspective cues include linear perspective, apparent  foreshortening, and vertical position in the field.  

•	 Linear perspective—parallel lines, such as runway  lights, power lines and railroad tracks, tend to  converge as distance from the observer increases.  [Figure 17-21A]   •	 Apparent foreshortening—the true shape of an object  or a terrain feature appears elliptical when viewed  from a distance.  [Figure 17-21B]   •	 Vertical position in the field—objects or terrain  features farther away from the observer appear higher  on the horizon than those closer to the observer.  [Figure 17-21C]  

# Aerial Perspective  

The clarity of an object and the shadow cast by it are  perceived by the brain and are cues for estimating distance.  Subtle variations in color or shade are clearer the closer the  observer is to an object. However, as distance increases,  these distinctions may become blurry. The same applies to  an object detail or texture. As a person gets farther from an  object, its discrete details become less apparent. Another  important fact to remember while flying at night is that every  object casts a shadow from a light source. The direction in  which the shadow is cast depends on the position of the light  source. If the shadow of an object is cast toward the observer,  the object is closer than the light source is to the observer.  

# Binocular Cues  

Binocular cues of an object are dependent upon the slightly  different viewing angle of each eye of an object. Binocular  perception is useful only when the object is close enough to  make an obvious difference in the viewing angle of both eyes.  In the flight environment, most distances outside the cockpit  are so great that binocular cues are of little, if any, value. In  addition, binocular cues operate on a more subconscious  level than monocular cues and are performed automatically.  

# Night Vision Illusions  

There are many different types of visual illusions that  commonly occur at night. Anticipating and maintaining  awareness of them is usually the best way to avoid them.  

# Autokinesis  

Autokinesis is caused by staring at a single point of light  against a dark background for more than a few seconds.  After a few moments, the light appears to move on its own.  Apparent movement of the light source will begin in about  8 to 10 seconds. To prevent this illusion, focus the eyes on  objects at varying distances and avoid fixating on one source  of light. This illusion can be eliminated or reduced by visual  scanning, by increasing the number of lights, or by varying  the light intensity. The most important of the three solutions  is visual scanning. A light or lights should not be stared at  for more than 10 seconds.  

# False Horizon  

A false horizon can occur when the natural horizon is  obscured or not readily apparent. It can be generated by  confusing bright stars and city lights. It can also occur while  flying toward the shore of an ocean or a large lake. Because  of the relative darkness of the water, the lights along the  shoreline can be mistaken for stars in the sky.  [Figure 17-22]  

# Reversible Perspective Illusion  

At night, an aircraft may appear to be moving away from  a second aircraft when it is, in fact, approaching a second  aircraft. This illusion often occurs when an aircraft is flying

parallel to another’s course. To determine the direction of  flight, pilots should observe aircraft lights and their relative  position to the horizon. If the intensity of the lights increases,  the aircraft is approaching; if the lights dim, the aircraft is  moving away.  

# Size-Distance Illusion  

This illusion results from viewing a source of light that is  increasing or decreasing in luminance (brightness). Pilots  may interpret the light as approaching or retreating.  

# Fascination (Fixation)  

This illusion occurs when pilots ignore orientation cues and  fix their attention on a goal or an object. Student pilots tend to  have this happen when they are concentrating on the aircraft  instruments or attempting to land. They become fixated on  one task and forget to look at what is going on around them.  At night, this can be especially dangerous because aircraft  ground-closure rates are difficult to determine, and there may  be minimal time to correct the situation.  

# Flicker Vertigo  

A light flickering at a rate between 4 and 20 cycles per  second can produce unpleasant and dangerous reactions. Such  conditions as nausea, vomiting, and vertigo may occur. On  rare occasions, convulsions and unconsciousness may also  occur. Proper scanning techniques at night can prevent pilots  from getting flicker vertigo.  

# Night Landing Illusions  

Landing illusions occur in many forms. Above featureless  terrain at night, there is a natural tendency to fly a lower- than-normal approach. Elements that cause any type of  visual obscurities, such as rain, haze, or a dark runway  environment, can also cause low approaches. Bright lights,  steep surrounding terrain, and a wide runway can produce the  illusion of being too low with a tendency to fly a higher-than- normal approach. A set of regularly spaced lights along a road  or highway can appear to be runway lights. Pilots have even  mistaken the lights on moving trains as runway or approach  lights. Bright runway or approach lighting systems can create  the illusion that the aircraft is closer to the runway, especially  where few lights illuminate the surrounding terrain.  

Prior to flying at night, it is best to learn and know the  challenges of the area in which you are flying in. Study the  area and know how to navigate your way through areas that  may pose a problem at night. For example, many areas near  water may be obscured by low lying clouds or fog. To help  deal with this type of situation, it is important to have a plan  before you leave the ground. In the daytime, fly the routes  and passes that you will be flying at night and determine the  minimum altitude you are willing to use at night. If weather  prevents you from maintaining the altitude that you planned,  make a decision early to turn   $180^{\circ}$   and land at an alternate  airport with better weather conditions. Always consider  safer alternatives rather than hope things will work out by  taking a chance.  

Pilots who fly at night should strongly consider oxygen  supplementation at altitudes and times not required by the  FAA, especially at night when critical judgment and hand-eye  coordination is necessary (e.g., IFR) or if he/she is a smoker  or not perfectly healthy.  

# Enhanced Night Vision Systems  

Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS) and Enhanced Flight Vision  Systems (EFVS) are two systems that can improve the safety  of flight at night. The technology of both is evolving rapidly  and being used more and more.  [Figure 17-23]  

![](images/ea94f1a5ff4b24d797f9349abb9dedb30eb85de291a88a18a0b9135a8452b938.jpg)  
Figure 17-23.   Synthetic and enhanced vision systems.  

# Synthetic Vision System  

A Synthetic Vision System (SVS) is an electronic means  to display a synthetic vision image of the external scene  topography to the flight crew.  [Figure 17-24]  It is not a  real-time image like that produced by an EFVS. Unlike  EFVS, SVS requires a terrain and obstacle database, a  precise navigation solution, and a display. The terrain  image is based on the use of data from a Digital Elevation  Model (DEM) that is stored within the SVS. With SVS, the  synthetic terrain/vision image is intended to enhance pilot  awareness of spatial position relative to important features  in all visibility conditions. This is particularly useful during  critical phases of flight, such as takeoff, approach, and  landing, where important features, such as terrain, obstacles,  runways, and landmarks, may be depicted on the SVS  display.  [Figure 17-25]  During approach operations, the

Figure 17-24.   SVS system.  

obvious advantages of SVS are that the digital terrain image  remains on the pilot’s display regardless of how poor the  visibility is outside.  

An SVS image can be displayed on either a head-down  display or head-up display (HUD); however, to date, SVS  has only been certified on head-down displays. Development  efforts to display a synthetic image on a HUD are currently  underway as are efforts that would combine SVS with a real- time sensor image produced by an EFVS. These systems are  known as Combined Vision Systems. While SVS is currently  certified as an aid to situation awareness only, the FAA  and aviation industry are working on defining operational  concepts and airworthiness criteria that would enable SVS  to be used for operational credit in certain low visibility  conditions. Other future enhancements to SVS displays could  include integrating ADS-B to display traffic information.  

# Enhanced Flight Vision System  

Enhanced Vision (EV) or Enhanced Flight Vision System  (EFVS) is an electronic means to provide a display of

the external scene by use of an imaging sensor, such as  a Forward-Looking InfraRed (FLIR) or millimeter wave  radar (MMWR). In 2004, 14 CFR part 91, section 91.175  was amended to reflect that operators conducting straight- in instrument approach procedures (in other than Category  II or Category III operations) may now operate below the  published decision height (DH) or minimum descent altitude  (MDA) when using an approved EFVS shown on the pilot’s  HUD. This rule change provides “operational credit” for EV  equipage. No such credit exists for SV.
