# Chapter 1 Gliders and Sailplanes  

# Introduction  

Welcome to the world of soaring. Whether it has been a  lifelong dream or a new interest, the pleasure of flying is  truly addictive and exhilarating. The intellectual challenge  combined with the quiet and beauty of flying high above the  earth are two of the many reasons that people both young and  old get hooked on flying gliders. If contemplating learning  more about the sport, an introductory flight absolutely helps  make the decision. Soaring gracefully through the air, along  with the meditative silence that surrounds you, is refreshing  and exciting. Organizations such as the Soaring Society of  America (SSA) have developed excellent programs not only  to track a pilot’s learning progression, but also issue badges  for flight and knowledge accomplishments. Glider clubs are  located all over the country and offer great flight training  schools and pilot camaraderie.  

The Glider Flying Handbook is designed to aid pilots  in achieving their goals in aviation and to provide the  knowledge and practical information needed to attain private,  commercial, and flight instructor category ratings for gliders.  This handbook, in conjunction with the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge, FAA-H-8083-25 (as revised), is a  source of basic knowledge for certification as a glider pilot  and instructor. There are numerous other commercial sources  available to the pilot for reference that should be obtained  for additional information.  

# Gliders—The Early Years  

The fantasy of flight led people to dream up intricate designs  in an attempt to imitate the flight of birds. Leonardo da Vinci  sketched a vision of flying machines in his 15th century  manuscripts. His work consisted of a number of wing designs  including a human-powered ornithopter, the name derived  from the Greek word for bird. Centuries later, when others  began to experiment with his designs, it became apparent that  the human body could not sustain flight by flapping wings like  birds.  [Figure 1-1]  The dream of human flight continued to  capture the imagination of many, but it was not until 1799  when Sir George Cayley, a Baronet in Yorkshire, England,  conceived a craft with stationary wings to provide lift, flappers  to provide thrust, and a movable tail to provide control.  

Otto Lilienthal was a German pioneer of human flight who  became known as the Glider King.  [Figure 1-2]  He was the  first person to make well-documented, repeated, successful  gliding flights beginning in 1891.  [Figure 1-3]  He followed  an experimental approach established earlier by Sir George

Cayley. Newspapers and magazines published photographs  of Lilienthal gliding, favorably influencing public and  scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines  becoming practical.  

By the early 1900s, the famed Wright Brothers were  experimenting with gliders and gliding flight in the hills

of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.  [Figure 1-4]  The Wrights  developed a series of gliders while experimenting with  aerodynamics, which was crucial to developing a workable  control system. Many historians, and most importantly the  Wrights themselves, pointed out that their game plan was to  learn flight control and become pilots specifically by soaring,  whereas all the other experimenters rushed to add power  without refining flight control. By 1903, Orville and Wilbur  Wright had achieved powered flight of just over a minute by  putting an engine on their best glider design.

By 1906, the sport of gliding was progressing rapidly. An  American glider meet was sponsored by the Aero Club of  America on Long Island, New York. By 1911, Orville Wright  had set a world duration record of flying his motorless craft  for 9 minutes and 45 seconds.  

By 1920, the sport of soaring was coming into its own.  Glider design was spurred on by developments in Germany  where the World War I Treaty of Versailles banned flying  power aircraft. New forms of lift were discovered that made  it possible to gain altitude and travel distances using these  previously unknown atmospheric resources. In 1921, Dr.  

Wolfgang Klemperer broke the Wright Brothers 1911 soaring  duration record with a flight of 13 minutes using ridge lift.  In 1928, Austrian Robert Kronfeld proved that thermal lift  could be used by a sailplane to gain altitude by making a  short out and return flight. In 1929, the National Glider  Association was founded in Detroit, Michigan; by 1930, the  first USA National Glider Contest was held in Elmira, New  York. In 1937, the first World Championships were held at  the Wasserkuppe in Germany.  

By the 1950s, soaring was developing rapidly with the first  American, Dr. Paul MacCready, Jr., taking part in a World  Soaring Championships held in Sweden. Subsequently, Dr.  MacCready went on to become the first American to win a  World Soaring Championship in 1956 in France.  

The period of the 1960s and 1980s found soaring growing  rapidly. During this period, there was also a revival of  hang gliders and ultralight aircraft as new materials and  a better understanding of low-speed aerodynamics made  new designs possible.  

By the late 1990s, aviation had become commonplace with  jet travel becoming critical to the world economy. Soaring  had grown into a diverse and interesting sport. Modern high  performance gliders are made from composite materials  and take advantage of highly refined aerodynamics and  control systems. Today, soaring pilots use sophisticated  instrumentation, including global positioning system  (GPS) and altitude information (variometer) integrated into  electronic glide computers to go farther, faster, and higher  than ever before.  

# Glider or Sailplane?  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines a glider  as a heavier-than-air aircraft that is supported in flight by the  dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces, and  whose free flight does not depend principally on an engine.  [Figure 1-5]  The term “glider” is used to designate the rating

that can be placed on a pilot certificate once a person successfully  completes required glider knowledge and practical tests.  

Another widely accepted term used in the industry is  sailplane. A sailplane is a glider (heavier-than-air fixed- wing aircraft) designed to fly efficiently and gain altitude  solely from natural forces, such as thermals and ridge waves.  [Figure 1-6]  Older gliders and those used by the military were  not generally designed to gain altitude in lifting conditions,  whereas modern day sailplanes are designed to gain altitude  in various conditions of lift. Some sailplanes are equipped  with sustaining engines to enable level flight even in light  sink, or areas of descending air flow. More sophisticated  sailplanes may have engines powerful enough to allow  takeoffs and climbs to soaring altitudes. In both cases, the  powerplants and propellers are designed to be stopped in  flight and retracted into the body of the sailplane to retain the  high efficiency necessary for nonpowered flight.  

![](images/2b04359286f5d6e7df3cea246e69320e4d35811467b210905ec33c98f2960fda.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.  A sailplane is a glider designed to fly efficienctly and  gain altitude solely from natural forces, such as thermals and  ridge waves.  

Gliding, that is flying a glider or sailplane, is relatively easy  to learn, but soaring, which is gaining altitude and traveling  without power, is much more difficult and immensely  satisfying when accomplished. Soaring refers to the sport  of flying sailplanes, which usually includes traveling  long distances and remaining aloft for extended periods  of time. Gliders were designed and built to provide short  flights off a hill down to a landing area. Since their wings  provided relatively low lift and high drag, these simple  gliders were generally unsuitable for sustained flight using  atmospheric lifting forces. Both terms are acceptable and  are synonymous. Early gliders were easy and inexpensive  to build, and they played an important role in flight training.  The most well-known example today of a glider is the space  shuttle, which literally glides back to earth. The space  shuttle, like gliders that remain closer to the earth, cannot  sustain flight for long periods of time.  

Self-launching gliders are equipped with engines; with the  engine shut down, they display the same flight characteristics  as nonpowered gliders.  [Figure 1-7]  The engine allows them  to be launched under their own power. Once aloft, pilots  of self-launching gliders can shut down the engine and fly  with the power off. The additional training and procedures  required to earn a self-launch endorsement are covered later  in this handbook.

# Glider Pilot Schools  

Most airports or glider bases have some type of pilot training  available, either through FAA-approved pilot schools or  individual FAA-certificated flight instructors. FAA-approved  glider schools usually provide a wide variety of training  aids, special facilities, and greater flexibility in scheduling.  A number of colleges and universities also provide glider  pilot training as a part of their overall pilot training curricula.  However, most glider training is conducted by individual  flight instructors through a membership in a glider club.  Also, there are several commercial glider companies located  around the United States offering flight training, sightseeing  glider rides, and glider towing services.  

Choosing the right facility or instructor for your glider training  should be both exciting and educational. Many factors need  to be considered when choosing the right school, such as  location, type of certification, part- or full-time training, and  cost. The quality of training received should be the most  important factor. Before interviewing schools, potential  student pilots should be educated on the types of training  curriculums that are available. Pilot training is conducted in  accordance with one of two regulatory categories: Title 14  of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 141 or 14  CFR part 61. Students can receive exceptional flight training  under either part 141 or 61 training programs, as both have the  same teaching and testing requirements. What differs is the  way you are taught in order to meet those same requirements.  

# 14 CFR Part 141 Pilot Schools  

Pilot schools that are certificated under 14 CFR part  141 provide a more structured training program with a  standardized FAA-approved training syllabus. This ensures  that all necessary skills are taught in a specific order through  approved lesson plans. Under part 141, students are also  required to complete a specific number of hours of formal  ground instruction either in a classroom or one on one with an  FAA-certificated flight instructor. Students are also required  to pass the FAA knowledge and practical tests. In order to  obtain approval and maintain their part 141 certification, pilot  schools must adhere to several FAA regulations.  

Because part 141 pilot schools must adhere to the approved  training regiment, their students are allowed to complete the  pilot certificate or rating in fewer flight training hours than  required by part 61. However, most students generally exceed  the reduced part 141 flight training hour requirements in order  to meet the proficiency standards to pass the practical test.  

# 14 CFR Part 61 Instruction  

Pilot training conducted under 14 CFR part 61 offers a  somewhat more flexible and less structured training program  than that conducted under part 141. A part 61 training  syllabus is not subject to FAA approval; therefore, flight  instructors have the flexibility to rearrange lesson plans to  suit the individual needs of their students. However, it is  important to understand that flight instructors must adhere  to the requirements of part 61 and train their students to the  standards of part 61.  

Training under part 61 does not require the student to  complete a formal ground school. Instead, students have  the following three options: (1) attend a ground school  course, (2) complete a home-study program, or (3) hire a  certificated flight or ground instructor to teach and review  any materials that they choose. Regardless of which option a  student chooses to take, all students are required to pass the  FAA knowledge and practical tests for the pilot certificate or  rating for which they are applying. The requirements for pilot  training under part 61 are less structured than those under  part 141, and part 61 may require more flight training hours  to obtain a pilot certificate or rating than part 141.  

Most glider training programs can be found on the SSA  website at www.ssa.org. Once you choose a general  location, make a checklist of things to look for in a training  organization. By talking to pilots, visiting the facility, and  reading articles in pilot magazines, a checklist can be made  and used to evaluate your options. Your choice might depend  on whether you are planning to obtain a sport or private pilot  certificate or pursuing a higher pilot certificate or a flight  instructor certificate toward becoming a professional glider  pilot. The quality of training is very important and should be  the first priority when choosing a course of training. Prior to  making a final decision, visit the facility being considered  and talk with management, instructors, and both current and  former students. Evaluate all training requirements using a  checklist, and then take some time to think things over before  making a decision.  

After deciding where to learn to fly and making the necessary  arrangements, training can begin. An important fact: ground  and flight training should be obtained as regularly and  frequently as possible. This assures maximum retention of  instruction and the achievement of proficiency for which  every pilot should strive.  

# Glider Certificate Eligibility Requirements  

To be eligible to fly a glider solo, an individual must  be at least 14 years of age and demonstrate satisfactory  aeronautical knowledge on a test developed by an instructor.  A student must also have received and logged ground and  flight training for the maneuvers and procedures in 14 CFR  part 61 that are appropriate to the make and model of aircraft  to be flown. A student pilot must demonstrate satisfactory  proficiency and safety. Only after all of these requirements  are met can an instructor endorse a student’s certificate and  logbook for solo flight.  

To be eligible for a private pilot certificate with a glider rating,  an individual must be at least 16 years of age, complete the  specific training and flight time requirements described in  14 CFR part 61, pass a knowledge test, and successfully  complete a practical test.  

To be eligible for a commercial or flight instructor glider  certificate, an individual must be 18 years of age, complete  the specific training requirements described in 14 CFR part  61, pass the required knowledge tests, and pass another  practical test. If currently a pilot for a powered aircraft is  adding a glider category rating on that certificate, the pilot  is exempt from the knowledge test but must satisfactorily  complete the practical test. Certificated glider pilots are not  required to hold an airman medical certificate to operate a  glider. However, they must not have any medical deficiencies.  

The FAA Practical Test Standards (PTS) establish the  standards for the knowledge and skills necessary for the  issuance of a pilot certificate. It is important to reference  the PTS, FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 60-22, Aeronautical  Decision Making, Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25), and the Risk Management  Handbook (FAA-H-8083-2) to understand the knowledge,  skills, and experience required to obtain a pilot certificate to  fly a glider. For more information on the certification of the  gliders themselves, refer to 14 CFR part 21, the European  Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification Specifications 

 (CS) 22.221, and the Weight and Balance Handbook 

 (FAA-H-8083-1).  

# Common Glider Concepts  

# Terminology  

There are a number of terms used in gliding that all glider  pilots should be familiar with. The list is not comprehensive,  but includes the following:  

•	 Knot—one nautical mile per hour (NMPH). A nautical  mile is 6,076.115 feet as opposed to 5,280 feet in a  statute mile. Rounded that is 6,000 feet, which divided  by 60 minutes equals 100 feet per minute (fpm). Hence,  this gives 1 on a variometer, which means one knot  per hour or approximately 100 fpm. A 4-knot thermal  lifts the glider at  $400\,\mathrm{fpm}$  .  •	 Lift—measured in knots, rising air lifting the glider  higher.  •	 Sink—falling air that forces the glider to lose height  and is measured in knots.  •	 Attitude—the orientation of an aircraft in the air  with respect to the horizon. If the aircraft is diving,  then it is said to have a “nose-down attitude about  its lateral axes.” Attitude can also be a roll or bank  as referenced to the longitudinal axis and pitch up or  down as referenced to lateral axis. •	 Pitch—the up and down movement around the lateral  axis for pitch. Increasing the pitch lifts the nose and  drops the tail. Decreasing the pitch drops the nose and  lifts the tail.  •	 Roll—movement around a line between the nose and  tail longitudinal axes. Rolling right drops the right  wing while lifting the left wing.  •	 Yaw—a turning motion in which the nose of the  aircraft moves to the right or left about its vertical axis.  •	 Cable—steel wire used to connect the glider to the  winch. It is approximately   $5\mathrm{mm}$   wide and should be  avoided at all times until after the correct training  for safe handling. There are some winch operations  using composite fiber cable that is stronger and lighter  than steel.  •	 Strop—a special part of the winch cable that is  designed to be handled. The strop has the tost rings  that are attached to the glider.  •	 Weak link—a safety device in the winch cable or tow  line. They come in various strengths (indicated by  their color) and the correct one must be used with a  given glider.  

•	 Elevator—a moveable section in the tailplane (the  small wing at the back of the glider) that effectively  controls whether the glider climbs or dives in flight.  •	 Thermal—a bubble or column of warm rising air.  Pilots try to find these columns of rising air and stay  within them to gain altitude.  

# Converting Metric Distance to Feet  

A glider pilot must also be able to convert distance in meters  to distance in feet, using the following conversion:  

1 meter  $=$   3.2808 feet Multiply the number of meters by 3.2808  

To convert kilometers to nautical miles and nautical miles  to kilometers or statute miles, use the following:  

1 nautical mile   $\mathrm{(NM)}=1.852$   kilometers (km) 1 nautical mile  $\mathrm{(NM)}=1.151$   statute miles (SM)  $1\;\mathrm{km}=0.53996\;\mathrm{NM}$  

# Chapter 2 Components and Systems  

# Introduction  

Although gliders come in an array of shapes and sizes, the  basic design features of most gliders are fundamentally the  same. All gliders conform to the aerodynamic principles  that make flight possible. When air flows over the wings of  a glider, the wings produce a force called lift that allows the  aircraft to stay aloft. Glider wings are designed to produce  maximum lift with minimum drag.  

# Glider Design  

The earlier gliders were made mainly of wood with metal  fastenings, stays, and control cables. Subsequent designs  led to a fuselage made of fabric-covered steel tubing  glued to wood and fabric wings for lightness and strength.  New materials, such as carbon fiber, fiberglass, glass  reinforced plastic (GRP), and Kevlar ®  are now being used  to developed stronger and lighter gliders. Modern gliders  are usually designed by computer-aided software to increase  performance. The first glider to use fiberglass extensively  was the Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24 Phönix, which first flew  in 1957.  [Figure 2-1]  Fiberglass is still used because of its  high strength to weight ratio and its ability to give a smooth  exterior finish to reduce drag. Drag has also been minimized  by more aerodynamic shapes and retractable undercarriages.  Flaps were installed when technology improved and are fitted  to the trailing edges of the wings on some gliders to minimize  the drag and to allow lower landing speeds.  

![](images/dd71859d3b54cf9e07bcbe62fcf49fa4d282d91dceb84615667e4e8561b12013.jpg)  
Figure 2-1.  The Akaflieg Stuttgart FS-24 Phönix, made in Germany,  was first flown on November 27, 1957.  

Most high-performance gliders are built of composites,  instead of metal or wood, with a gel-coat finish. The gel  coat is susceptible to damage from exposure to ultraviolet  (UV) radiation from the sun, as well as prolonged exposure  to moisture. At some soaring sites, pilots can keep the glider  assembled in a hangar, but the composite glider is more  frequently rigged before flying and derigged after flying. The  transition to high-performance gliders necessitates development  of checklists and discipline during glider assembly and  disassembly. Other considerations for gel-coat care include  extreme cold soaking. There is evidence that flying a composite  glider with a gel-coat finish to very high and cold altitudes  followed by a quick descent to warmer levels can seriously  reduce the life of the gel coat. Composite gliders appear to  be more susceptible to flutter than metal gliders. Flutter is a  function of true airspeed. The GFM/POH of composite gliders  sometimes presents a table of the indicated  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   for different  heights. For instance, a popular two-seat composite glider  shows 135 knots as the sea level   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  , 128 knots at 10,000  feet MSL, 121 knots at 13,000 feet MSL, etc. Read the GFM/ POH carefully and obey the limitations set forth in the manual.  

With each generation of new materials and development and  improvements in aerodynamics, the performance of gliders  has increased. One measure of performance is glide ratio. A  glide ratio of 30:1 means that in smooth air a glider can travel  forward 30 feet while only losing 1 foot of altitude. Glide  ratio is discussed further in Chapter 5, Glider Performance.  

Due to the critical role that aerodynamic efficiency plays in  the performance of a glider, gliders often have aerodynamic  features seldom found in other aircraft. The wings of a modern  racing glider have a specially designed low-drag laminar flow  airfoil. After the wing surfaces have been shaped by a mold  with great accuracy, they are highly polished and painted  with a gel coat (light fiberglass spray/sealer). Some high  performance gliders have winglets installed at the ends of  the wings. These winglets are computer designed to decrease  drag and improve handling performance.  [Figure 2-2]  To  continually ensure the best in aerodynamics, manufacturers  use specially designed seals in the vicinity of the flight  controls (i.e., ailerons, rudder, and elevator) to prevent the  flow of air in the opposite direction through the control surface  gaps, which causes turbulence over the area.  

![](images/709bbc755bd4091fe8378a91a80a2349b2c51ae37f7a6ab0b59642b4fb87a2d5.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.  Schempp-Hirth Ventus-2 glider with factory winglets  installed.  

Additional high-technology designs include such items as  bug wipers. These are very similar to a car windshield wiper.  They may be installed to wipe the wings while in flight and  remove insects that are disturbing the smooth flow of air over  the wing by sliding back and forth along the leading edge of  the wing.  [Figure 2-3]  Bug wipers can be operated by small  electrical motors or by aerodynamics.  

Modern competition gliders carry water ballast that can  be jettisoned. This water acts as ballast in the wings and  sometimes in the vertical stabilizer. The extra weight provided  by the water ballast is advantageous if the lift is likely to be  strong, and may also be used to adjust the glider’s center of  gravity (CG) during flight. Moving the CG toward the rear  by carrying water in the vertical tail section reduces some  

![](images/d4d2b5e67d2889b9aa02c766e82cd993f89f4f3fd942d6ba4e92ebf436493d8c.jpg)

of the required down force from the horizontal stabilizer  aerodynamics and the resultant drag from that down force.  Although heavier gliders have a slight disadvantage when  climbing in rising air, they achieve a higher speed at any given  glide angle. This is an advantage in strong conditions when the  gliders spend only little time climbing in thermals. The pilot  can jettison the water ballast before it becomes a disadvantage  in weaker thermal conditions. Another use of water ballast  is to dampen air turbulence that may be encountered during  ridge soaring. To avoid undue stress on the airframe, gliders  may jettison any water ballast before landing.  [Figure 2-4] This is discussed further in Chapter 5, Glider Performance.  

![](images/dde17f5f704f317d865335441a9cbec0f368dd160ff1f713056172c9e6769d90.jpg)  
Figure 2-4.  Sailplane dropping water ballast before landing.  

Most gliders are built in Europe and are designed to meet  the requirements of the European Aviation Safety Agency  (EASA), similar to the United States Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA). The EASA Certification Specification  CS-22 (previously Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR)-22),  defines minimum standards for safety in a wide range of  characteristics such as controllability and strength. For  example, it must have design features to minimize the  possibility of incorrect assembly (gliders are often stowed  in disassembled configuration with at least the wings being  detached). Automatic connection of the controls during  rigging is the common method of achieving this.  

Throughout the years, flying gliders has not only been a  recreational past time but are built and used for sport as  well. Many glider pilots take part in gliding competitions  that usually involve racing. Modern gliding competitions  now comprise closed tasks; everyone races on an aerial route  around specified turnpoints, plus start and finish points that  bring everybody back to base. The weather forecast and the  performance of the gliders, as well as the experience level  of the pilots, dictate the length of the task. Today, most of  the points are speed points, and the rule is to set the task so  all pilots have a fair chance of completing it.  

With the advent of global positioning systems (GPS), new  types of tasks were introduced, such as speed or distance  tasks within assigned areas and speed or distance tasks with  pilot-selected turn points. Despite the use of pilot-selected  turn points made possible by GPS, tasks over a fixed course  are still used frequently. The Fédération Aéronautique  Internationale (FAI), the world’s air sports federation, is a  nongovernmental and nonprofit international organization  with the basic aim of furthering aeronautical and astronautical  activities worldwide. The FAI Gliding Commission is the  sporting body overseeing air sports at the international level  so that essentially the same classes and class definitions are  followed in all countries.  

The following is an overview of the seven classes of gliders  that are currently recognized by the FAI and are eligible for  European and World Championships:  

1.	 Standard class—no flaps, 15 meter (49.2 feet)  wingspan, water ballast allowed.  2.	 15 meter class—flaps allowed, 15 meter (49.2 feet)  wingspan, water ballast allowed.  3.	 18 meter class-—flaps allowed, 18 meter (59 feet)  wingspan, water ballast allowed.  4.	 Open class—no restrictions on wingspan, except a  limit of  $850\,\mathrm{kg}$   (1,874 pounds for the maximum all-up  weight). Open classes may have wingspans in excess  of 85 feet or more.  [Figure 2-5] 5.	 Two-seat class—maximum wingspan of 20 meters  (65.6 feet), also known by the German name of  Doppelsitzer.  [Figure 2-6]   6.	 Club class—this class allows a wide range of older,  small gliders with different performance. The scores  must be adjusted by handicapping. Water ballast is  not allowed.

7.	 World class—the FAI Gliding Commission, which  is part of the FAI and an associated body called  Organization Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile  (OSTIV), announced a competition in 1989 for a low- cost glider that had moderate performance, was easy  to assemble and handle, and was safe for low-hours  pilots to fly. The winning design was announced in  1993 as the Warsaw Polytechnic PW-5. This allows  competitions to be run with only one type of glider.  

Glider airframes are designed with a fuselage, wings,  and empennage or tail section. Self-launching gliders are  equipped with an engine that enables them to launch without  assistance and return to an airport under engine power if  soaring conditions deteriorate.  

# The Fuselage  

The fuselage is the portion of the airframe to which the  wings and empennage are attached. The fuselage houses  the cockpit and contains the controls for the glider, as well  as a seat for each occupant. Glider fuselages can be formed  from wood, fabric over steel tubing, aluminum, fiberglass,  Kevlar ®  or other composites, or a combination of these  materials.  [Figure 2-7]  

# Wings and Components  

Glider wings incorporate several components that help the  pilot maintain the attitude of the glider and control lift and  drag. These include ailerons and lift and drag devices, such  as spoilers, dive brakes, and flaps. Glider wings vary in size  and span from 12.2 meters (40 feet) to 30 meter (101.38 feet).  

![](images/4f1f9db1fcbae3dace48970c6a182b7a0d4657ab63a297062e46b930f25ac701.jpg)  
Figure 2-7.  Components of a glider.  

A wing may consist of a single piece attached to the fuselage  to as many as four pieces (on one side).  

The ailerons control movement around the longitudinal axis,  known as roll. The ailerons are attached to the outboard  trailing edge of each wing and move in opposite directions.  

Moving the aileron controls with the control stick to the  right causes the right aileron to deflect upward and the left  aileron to deflect downward. The upward deflection of the  right aileron decreases the effective camber (curvature of  the wing surface), resulting in decreased lift on the right  wing.  [Figure 2-8]  The corresponding downward deflection  of the left aileron increases the effective camber, resulting  in increased lift on the left wing. Thus, the increased lift on  the left wing and decreased lift on the right wing causes the  glider to roll to the right.  

![](images/98c435bc361d3b0e0e18385475412bacc9f98d9b6c5974d51e6ebf2bdac34090.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.  The wing camber remains the same physically, but the  ailerons change the “effective” camber of the wing and increase  or decrease lift to change lift vectors to affect turns.  

# Lift/Drag Devices  

Gliders are equipped with devices that modify the lift/drag  of the wing. These high drag devices include spoilers, dive  brakes, and flaps. Spoilers extend from the upper surface of  the wing, interrupting or spoiling the airflow over the wings.  This action causes the glider to descend more rapidly. Dive  brakes extend from both the upper and lower surfaces of the  wing and help to increase drag.  

Flaps are located on the trailing edge of the wing, inboard  of the ailerons, and can be used to increase lift, drag, and  descent rate.  [Figure 2-9]  Each flap type has a use depending  on aircraft design. When the glider is cruising at moderate  airspeeds in wings-level flight, the flaps can sometimes be  set to a negative value (up from trail or level) for high speed  cruising in some high efficiency gliders. When the flap is  extended downward, wing camber is increased, and the lift  and the drag of the wing increase.  

Gliders are generally equipped with simple flaps and these  flaps can generally be set in three different positions which  are trail, down or negative.  [Figure 2-10]  When deflected  downward, it increases the effective camber and changes the  wing’s chord line, which  is an imaginary straight line drawn  from the leading edge of an airfoil to the trailing edge. Both  of these factors increase the lifting capacity of the wing.  

Negative flap is used at high speeds at which wing lift  reduction is desired to reduce drag. When the flaps are

extended in an upward direction, or negative setting, the  effective camber of the wing is reduced, resulting in a  reduction of lift produced by the wing at a fixed angle of  attack and airspeed. This action reduces the down force,  or balancing force, required from the horizontal stabilizer.  

# Empennage  

The empennage includes the entire tail section, consisting  of the fixed surfaces, such as the horizontal stabilizer and  vertical fin, and moveable surfaces such as the elevator or  stabilator, rudder and any trim tabs. These two fixed surfaces  act like the feathers on an arrow to steady the glider and help  maintain a straight path through the air.  [Figure 2-11]  

![](images/dea50ca56f68b1ac9372f3209ce0e71a667b3ae8a9fe11cff5373572f941d331.jpg)  
Figure 2-11.  Empennage components.  

The elevator is attached to the back of the horizontal  stabilizer. The elevator controls movement around the lateral  axis. This is known as pitch. During flight, the elevator is  used to move the nose up and down, which controls the  pitch attitude of the glider. The horizon is the primary pitch  reference for a glider pilot. The elevator is primarily used to  change or hold the same angle of attack of the glider. The trim  tab, normally located on the elevator of the glider, lessens the  resistance felt on the flight controls due to the airflow over  the associated control surface.  

The rudder is attached to the back of the vertical stabilizer.  The rudder controls movement about the vertical axis. This  is known as yaw. The rudder is used in combination with  the ailerons and elevator to coordinate turns during flight.  

Some gliders use a stabilator, which is used in lieu of an  elevator and horizontal stabilizer. The stabilator pivots up  and down on a central hinge point. When pulling back on the  control stick, the nose of the glider moves up; when pushing  forward, the nose moves down. Stabilators sometimes employ  an anti-servo trim tab to achieve pitch trim. The anti-servo  tab provides a control feel comparable to that of an elevator.  

Trim devices reduce pilot workload by relieving the pressure  required on the controls to maintain a desired airspeed. One  type of trim device found on gliders is the elevator trim tab,  a small, hinged, cockpit-adjustable tab on the trailing edge of  the elevator.  [Figure 2-12]  Other types of elevator trim device  include bungee spring systems and ratchet trim systems. In  these systems, fore and aft control stick pressure is applied  by an adjustable spring or bungee cord.

Figure 2-12.  Additional empennage components.  

Primary flight controls (aileron, elevator, and rudder), assisted  by the trim devices, reduce control loading and provide  positive feed to the pilot. The trim tab is either servo or anti- servo.  [Figure 2-13]  Anti-servo tab movement is opposite  to the control surface providing a positive feedback (or feel)  to the pilot. Servo tabs move in the same direction as the  control surface and allow the pilot to remove (or lighten)  control load, reducing fatigue during flight and providing  aerodynamic trim.

Figure 2-13.  Additional empennage components.  

Over the years, the shape of the empennage has taken different  forms. Early gliders were most often built with the horizontal  stabilizer mounted at the bottom of the vertical stabilizer.  This type of tail arrangement is called the conventional tail.  Other gliders were designed with a T-tail, and still others  were designed with V-tail. T-tail gliders have the horizontal  stabilizer mounted on the top of the vertical stabilizer, forming  a T. V-tails have two tail surfaces mounted to form a V. V-tails  combine elevator and rudder movements. This combination  of elevator and rudder are referred as ruddervators.  

# Towhook Devices  

An approved towhook is a vital part of glider equipment. The  towhook is designed for quick release when the pilot exerts a  pulling force on the release handle. As a safety feature (on most  of the bellyhooks (CG hook)), if back pressure occurs from  either getting out of position during the tow or overrunning  the towrope, the release automatically opens. Part of the glider  pilot’s preflight is ensuring that the towhook releases properly  with applied forward and back pressure.  

The glider may have a towhook located on or under the nose  and/or under the center of gravity (CG), near the main landing  gear. The forward towhook is used for aerotow. The CG hook  is used for ground launch. A glider with only a CG hook  may be approved for aerotow in accordance with the Glider  Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook.  [Figure 2-14]  

![](images/18710a49947a9a5b8478f63e85639ccda56e57d284b28d2c58204b5e8a388dbc.jpg)

# Powerplant  

# Self-Launching Gliders  

Self-launching gliders are equipped with engines powerful  enough to enable them to launch without external assistance.  The engines may also be used to sustain flight if the soaring  conditions deteriorate. Self-launching gliders differ widely  in terms of engine location and type of propeller. There are  two types of self-launching gliders: touring motor gliders  and high-performance self-launching gliders.  

Touring motor gliders are equipped with a fixed, nose-mounted  engine and a full feathering propeller.  [Figure 2-15]  Touring  motor gliders resemble an airplane to the untrained eye.  They do have some basic airplane characteristics but are  not certified as an airplane. On other types of self-launching  gliders, the engine and propeller are located aft of the cockpit.  High-performance self-launching gliders generally are seen  with engines and propellers mounted behind the cockpit  that completely retract into the fuselage for minimal drag  in the soaring mode.  [Figure 2-16]  Propellers may fold or  may simple align with the engine and retract completely.  This configuration preserves the smooth low drag nose  configurations important for good soaring efficiencies. When  the engine and propeller are not in use, they are retracted  into the fuselage, reducing drag and increasing soaring  performance. These types of self-launch engines are usually  coupled to a folding propeller, so the entire powerplant can  be retracted and the bay doors are closed and sealed.  

![](images/addfb6137d955fab0a9100060092e1c1984c95252d34d4002590534523d93f2e.jpg)  
Figure 2-15.  A Grob G109B touring motor glider.  

# Sustainer Engines  

Some gliders are equipped with sustainer engines to assist in  remaining aloft long enough to return to an airport. However,  sustainer engines do not provide sufficient power to launch  the glider from the ground without external assistance.  These sailplanes are launched by either aerotow or ground  launch.  [Figure 2-17]  A more detailed explanation of engine  operations can be found in Chapter 7, Launch and Recovery  Procedures and Flight Maneuvers.  

# Landing Gear  

Glider landing gear usually includes a main wheel, a front  skid or wheel and a tail wheel or skid, and often wing tip  wheels or skid plates. Gliders designed for high speed and low  drag often feature a fully retractable main landing gear and a  small breakaway tailwheel or tail skid. Breakaway tail skids  are found on high-performance gliders, and are designed to  break off when placed under side loads.  [Figure 2-18]  

For safety reasons, the main landing gear remains extended  during the launch process. If there is a tow break or early  release, the pilot needs to focus on a safe return. The pilot’s  

![](images/e5875b9193d5dfdbeffc2ca576f03ea382e8b6c1855f8708ae5bffdc418b1b2f.jpg)  
Figure 2-17.  A Schleicher ASH 26e motor glider with the sustainer  engine mast extended.  

normal landing checklist provides a landing gear check, but  during a low-altitude emergency, important items could be  skipped on any checklist. Therefore, it is good practice to  leave the main gear extended until reaching a safe altitude.  

# Wheel Brakes  

The wheel brake, mounted on the main landing gear wheel,  helps the glider slow down or stop after touchdown. The  type of wheel brake used often depends on the design of  the glider. Many early gliders relied on friction between the  nose skid and the ground to come to a stop. Current glider  models are fitted with drum brakes, disk brakes, and friction  brakes. The most common type of wheel brake found in  modern gliders is the disk brake, which is very similar to  the disk brake on the front wheels of most cars. Most glider  disk brakes are hydraulically operated to provide maximum  braking capability. Wheel brake controls vary from one glider  type to another.

# Chapter 3 Aerodynamics of Flight  

# Introduction  

To understand what makes a glider fly, pilots must first have  an understanding of aircraft aerodynamics and how flight  is possible. An understanding of aerodynamics and how it  affects takeoffs, flight maneuvers, and landings allows pilots  to be more skillful and aware of the capabilities of the glider.  A thorough discussion about aeronautical terminology and  concepts related to aircraft in flight can be found in the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25),  which new pilots should review before learning about the  aerodynamics specific to gliders. This chapter discusses the  fundamentals of aerodynamics as it relates to gliders and glider  performance. The study of aerodynamics is a complicated  science, and pilots should consider the task of learning  aerodynamics as critical as learning how to land safely.  

#  

# Forces of Flight  

There are four forces that act upon an aircraft during straight- and-level flight. They are lift, gravity, thrust, and drag. Lift  counters gravity, and drag counters thrust. When all four  forces are in balance, straight-and-level flight is sustained.  Engine-powered gliders obtain thrust from the engine. Once  in flight and the engine has been shut off, or the glider has  been launched, towed, or winched, the need to obtain thrust  is still there. The glider does this by converting the potential  energy that it has accumulated into kinetic energy as it  glides downward, trading height for distance. In essence, the  gravity vector becomes the horizontal forward thrust vector  component. We measure the force of gravity as the weight in  pounds or kilograms. This explains why the faster the glider  flies, the faster it also descends.  

Figure 3-1  shows a basic vector diagram for an unpowered  glider with all forces in equilibrium. The lift vector is  effectively split into two components: one part is opposing  the weight force (gravity in straight-and-level flight), and  the other component of the lift vector opposes drag by  supplying thrust by the conversion of potential energy of  the elevated weight of the glider into kinetic energy. This  conversion continues until the airframe comes to rest on the  surface. A glider is always descending in the air. This allows  development of thrust by the energy conversion process.  The objective of a glider pilot is to remain in air rising faster  than the glider must descend to maintain flying speed. The  same is true for a powered aircraft with its engine turned  off. These forces are explained in greater detail in the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25)  and by examining Newton’s laws of motion.  

![](images/ce25868813507e8cf5b25b4852fbb284983f8bab79b43d8ab7f2f44026fbba38.jpg)  
Figure 3-1.  Vector components of lift, drag, and weight (gravity).  

# Newton’s Third Law of Motion  

According to Newton’s Third Law of Motion, for every  action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Thus, the  air that is deflected downward also produces an upward  (lifting) reaction. The wing’s construction is designed to  take advantage of certain physical laws that generate two  actions from the air mass. One is a positive pressure lifting  action from the air mass below the wing, and the other is a  negative pressure lifting action from the lowered pressure  above the wing.  

As the airstream strikes the relatively flat lower surface of the  wing when inclined at a small angle to its direction of motion,  the air is forced to rebound downward, causing an upward  reaction in positive lift. At the same time, airstream striking  the upper curve section of the leading edge of the wing is  deflected upward, over the top of the wing. The increase in  airspeed on the top of the wing produces a sharp drop in  pressure. Associated with the lowered pressure is downwash,  a downward backward flow. In other words, a wing shaped to  cause an action on the air, and forcing it downward, provides  an equal reaction from the air, forcing the wing upward. If  a wing is constructed in such form that it causes a lift force  greater than the weight of the glider, the glider flies.  

If all the required lift were obtained from the deflection of air  by the lower surface of the wing, a glider would need only  a flat wing like a kite. This, of course, is not the case at all.  The balance of the lift needed to support the glider comes  from the flow of air above the wing. Herein lies the key to  flight. Lift is the result of the airflow above and over the wing  lowering the air pressure above the wing, which pull the wing  upwards and the downwash from below the wing pushing  the wing upward. This fact must be thoroughly understood  to continue in the study of flight.  

# Lift  

Lift opposes the downward force of weight (gravity) and is  produced by the dynamic effects of the surrounding airstream  acting on the wing. Lift acts perpendicular to the flightpath  through the wing’s center of lift. There is a mathematical  relationship between lift, angle of attack (AOA), airspeed,  altitude, and the size of the wing. In the lift equation, these  factors correspond to the coefficient of lift, velocity, air  density, and wing surface area. These relationships are  expressed in  Figure 3-2 . For a complete explanation of  the lift formula and terms refer to the Pilots Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge.  

This shows that for lift to increase, one or more of the  factors on the other side of the equation must increase. Lift  is proportional to the square of the velocity, or airspeed;  therefore, doubling airspeed quadruples the amount of lift if  everything else remains the same. Likewise, if other factors  remain the same while the coefficient or lift increases, lift  also increases. The coefficient of lift goes up as the AOA is  increased. As air density increases, lift increases. However,  

# ρ 2 L = C L  V  2 S  

$\mathsf{C}_{\perp}=$   Coefficient of lift    (This dimensionless number is the ratio of lift     pressure to dynamic pressure and area. It is     specific to a particular airfoil shape, and, below     the stall, it is proportional to angle of attack.)  $\textsf{V}=$   Velocity (feet per second)  $\uprho\ =$  Air density (slugs per cubic foot)  $\textsf{S}=$  Wing surface area (square feet)  

Figure 3-2.  Equation of the factors of lift.  

glider pilots are usually more concerned with how lift is  diminished by reductions in air density on a hot day, or as  they climb higher.  

# The Effects of Drag on a Glider  

The force that resists the movement of the glider through the  air is called drag. Two different types of drag combine to  form total drag: parasite and induced. The various types of  drag are explained in greater detail in the Pilot’s Handbook  of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25).  

# Parasite Drag  

Parasite drag is the resistance offered by the air to anything  moving through it. The aircraft surface deflects or interferes  with the smooth airflow around the glider. The wing of the  sailplane alone has very low parasite drag, but when the total  drag of the glider is added to it, the amount of drag becomes  significant. This is apparent particularly at high speeds since  parasite drag increases with the square of speed. Simply put,  if the speed of the glider is doubled, parasite drag increases  four times.  [Figure 3-3]  Parasite drag is divided into three  types: form drag, skin friction, and interference drag.  

![](images/7c23d7f0f57f9c89674a9b1a2f631e600443a5bbfcb54b27aba11f64ec00c6f4.jpg)  
Figure 3-3.  Drag versus speed.  

# Form Drag  

Form drag results from the turbulent wake caused by  the separation of airflow from the surface of a structure.  [Figure 3-4]  Any object moving through the air has to push  

![](images/311d494bc56ce03489879d415a54600ce63ef3b4f4088907743528f00f4c5114.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.  Streamlined airfoil designs greatly reduce form drag  by reducing the amount of airflow separation.  

the air in front of it out of the way. This causes a buildup of  pressure in front of the object. Similarly, the object leaves  a low-pressure void in its wake. This difference in pressure  between the front and back surfaces of the object results in the  force called form drag. Form drag can be reduced by reducing  the object’s cross-sectional area or by streamlining it.  

# Skin Friction Drag  

Skin friction drag is caused by the roughness of the glider’s  surfaces. Even though the surfaces may appear smooth, they  may be quite rough when viewed under a microscope. This  roughness allows a thin layer of air to cling to the surface and  create small eddies or areas of lower pressure that contribute  to drag. As air flows across a wing, friction brings the layer  of air molecules directly in contact with the surface to a  standstill. Air is a viscous fluid, hence the stationary layer of  air on the wing’s surface slows the layer above it, but not as  much as the layer above. This layer then slows the layer above  it, but again not as much, and so on. Therefore, the velocity  of the flow increases with distance from the surface until the  full speed of the flow is reached. This layer of decelerated air  is called the boundary layer. The frictional forces that create  the boundary layer  [Figure 3-5]  create an equal and opposite  skin friction force on the glider. When the surface area is  reduced, the amount of skin friction is reduced.  

The boundary layer can take on two distinct forms: the  laminar boundary layer and the turbulent boundary layer.  

•	 Laminar boundary layer—each layer of air molecules  slides smoothly over its neighbors.  [Figure 3-6]  

![](images/ce9808e99a7dc560d41db76baf2db7a76404cde617803032bda1b8ea816a7a00.jpg)

Figure 3-6.  Laminar boundary layer.  

•	 Turbulent boundary layer—dominated by eddies and  irregular turbulent flow.  [Figure 3-7]  

![](images/a427beda3ce81e0b49489a293cfb5099c5235b9c11599b8da375ccefd557758f.jpg)  
Figure 3-7.  Turbulent boundary layer.  

Turbulent boundary layers generate 5 to 10 times more skin  friction drag than the equivalent laminar boundary layer.  [Figure 3-8]  Therefore, glider designers try to maintain  laminar flow across as much of the aircraft as possible.  Figure 3-9  shows why this turbulent transition occurs.  

There is a point that is referred to as the separation point, in  which the boundary layer breaks away from the surface of the  wing due to the magnitude of the positive pressure gradient.  Beneath the separated layer, bubbles of stagnant air form,  creating additional drag because of the lower pressure in the  wake behind the separation point.  

![](images/8919b72ba8b7cac472bfef50300ae884b0528f2d110a7185581e89a0b2bed31e.jpg)

Figure 3-9.  Combinations of low and high pressure on the airfoil  causing a turbulent flow of air.  

These bubbles can be reduced or even eliminated by shaping the  airfoil to move the separation point downstream or by adding  a turbulator. Turbulators are aerodynamically positioned in a  spanwise line along the wing and are used to trip laminar flow  air into turbulent flow air at a desired location on the wing. This  is beneficial because the turbulent boundary layer contains more  energy, which will delay separation until a greater magnitude  of negative pressure gradient is reached, effectively moving  the separation point further aft on the airfoil and possible  eliminating separation completely. A consequence of the  turbulent boundary layer is increased skin friction relative to a  laminar boundary layer, but this is very small compared to the  increase in drag associated with separation.  

In gliders, the turbulator is often a thin zig-zag strip that is  placed on the underside of the wing and sometimes on the fin.  [Figure 3-10]  For a glider with low Reynolds numbers (i.e.,  where minimizing turbulence and drag is a major concern),  the small increase in drag from the turbulator at higher speeds  is minor compared with the larger improvements at best glide  speed, at which the glider can fly the farthest for a given height.  

![](images/cdd0d4140509b5dafc2cb372dff04f6dfa730c7b1b99e63d6338d9c805d8d01c.jpg)  
Figure 3-10.  Glider wing on the left shows the airflow with a turbulator installed and the glider wing on the right shows how the airflow  is disturbed without the turbulator installed.  

The boundary layer can also be tripped into a turbulent flow  at any point by discontinuities on the wing’s surface. It is  important to keep wings clean and avoid rain and icing to  prevent premature transition, and the increase in drag that it  causes. As the boundary layer is only 1.0 millimeter thick at  the leading edge, objects, such as rivets, splattered insects,  rain drops, ice crystals, and dust, are all large enough to  cause localized turbulent transition to occur.  [Figure 3-11]  

# Interference Drag  

Interference drag occurs when varied currents of air over a  glider meet and interact. Placing two objects adjacent to one  another may produce turbulence 50–200 percent greater than  the parts tested separately. An example of interference drag  is the mixing of air over structures, such as the wing, tail  surfaces, and wing struts. Interference drag can be reduced  on gliders with fairings to streamline the intersection of air.  

# Induced Drag  

Induced drag is generated as the wing is driven through the  air to develop the difference in air pressures that we call lift.  As the higher pressure air on the lower surface of the airfoil  curves around the end of the wing and fills in the lower  pressure area on the upper surface, the lift is lost, yet the  energy to produce the different pressures is still expended.  The result is drag because it is wasted energy. The more  energy the glider requires to fly, the greater the required rate  of descent is to supply sufficient energy to convert into thrust  

![](images/e0228d59f47676dcac25a9b12a11d77bf562b5774f925cee0694cff5133d4181.jpg)  
Figure 3-11.  Turbulence due to insects, ice crystals, and dust.  

to overcome that unnecessary drag. The energy that produces  the vortices is wasted energy. The object of glider design is  to convert all of the energy into useful lift and the necessary  thrust. Any wasted energy translates into poorer performance.  [Figure 3-12]  Glider designers attempt to reduce drag by  increasing the aspect ratio of the glider. The greater the aspect  ratio of the wing is, the lower the induced drag is. Wingtip  devices, or winglets, are also used to improve the efficiency  of the glider. There are several types of wingtip devices and,  though they function in different manners, the intended effect  is always to reduce the aircraft’s drag by altering the airflow  near the wingtips. Such devices increase the effective aspect  ratio of a wing, without materially increasing the wingspan.  

# Total Drag  

Total drag on a glider is the sum of parasite and induced drag.  The total drag curve represents these combined forces and is  plotted against airspeed.  [Figure 3-13]  

$\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$   is the point at which the lift-to-drag ratio is greatest. At  this speed, the total lift capacity of the glider, when compared  to the total drag of the glider, is most favorable. In calm air,  this is the airspeed used to obtain maximum glide distance.  

![](images/3dec8a7ec1185534aabae0554b8406d485e310da22765ea03b9810c4baf477df.jpg)  
Figure 3-13.  Total drag from the sum of parasite and induced drag.  

# Wing Planform  

The shape, or planform, of the wings also has an effect on  the amount of lift and drag produced. The four most common  wing planforms used on gliders are elliptical, rectangular,  tapered, and swept forward.  [Figure 3-14]  

# Elliptical Wing  

An elliptical wing is a wing planform shape that minimizes  induced drag. Elliptical taper shortens the chord near the  wingtips in such a way that all parts of the wing experience  equivalent downwash, and lift at the wing tips is essentially  

![](images/f47bd1d7d2ce351754295a0f10bf37c33958c9cb0a5fb1213af484cc7ea027dd.jpg)

Figure 3-14.  Planforms of glider wings.  

zero, improving aerodynamic efficiency. This wing design is  difficult and costly to manufacture because of the compound  curves in its design. The elliptical wing is more efficient in  terms of  $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{D}}$  , but the wing’s uniform lift distribution causes  the entire span of the wing to stall simultaneously, potentially  causing loss of control with little warning.  

# Rectangular Wing  

The rectangular wing is similar in efficiency to the elliptical  wing, but is much easier to build. Rectangular wings have  very gentle stall characteristics with a warning buffet prior to  stall, and are easier to manufacture than elliptical wings. One  drawback to this wing design is that rectangular wings create  more induced drag than an elliptical wing of comparable size.  

# Tapered Wing  

The tapered wing is the planform found most frequently  on gliders. Assuming equal wing area, the tapered wing  produces less drag than the rectangular wing, because there  is less area at the tip of the tapered wing. If speed is the  primary consideration, a tapered wing is more desirable than  a rectangular wing, but a tapered wing with no twist (also  called washout) has undesirable stall characteristics.  

# Swept-Forward Wing  

A swept-forward planform is a wing configuration in which  the quarter-chord line of the wing has a forward sweep.  Swept-forward wings are used to allow the lifting area of  the wing to move forward, while keeping the mounting  point aft of the cockpit. This wing configuration is used on  some tandem two-seat gliders to allow for a small change in  center of gravity (CG) with the rear seat occupied, or while  flying solo. This type of planform design gives the glider  increased maneuverability due to airflow from wing tip to  wing root, preventing a stall of the wing tips and ailerons at  high angles of attack. Instead, the stall occurs in the region  of the wing root.  

# Washout  

Washout is built into wings by putting a slight twist between  the wing root and wing tip. When washout is designed into the  wing, the wing displays very good stall characteristics. Moving  outward along the span of the wing, the trailing edge moves  up in reference to the leading edge. This twist causes the wing  root to have a greater AOA than the tip, and as a result, stall  first. This provides ample warning of the impending stall and,  at the same time, allows continued aileron control.  

# Glide Ratio  

Glide ratio is the number of feet a glider travels horizontally  in still air for every foot of altitude lost. If a glider has a 50:1  glide ratio, then it travels 50 feet for every foot of altitude lost.  

$$
{\mathrm{Gide~ratio}}={\frac{\mathrm{Lift}}{\mathrm{Drag}}}\colon1
$$  

This explains why minimizing drag is so critically important.  Because drag varies with airspeed, the glide ratio must also  vary with airspeed. A glide polar shown in  Figure 3–15  is  a graph, normally provided in a glider’s flight manual, that  details the glider’s still air sink rate at airspeeds within its  flight envelope. The glide ratio at a particular airspeed can  be estimated from the glide polar using:  

![](images/cff95d45ed125852a8e8267a29240fc3d37a1a8d81591537666a43b3e37538b3.jpg)  
Figure 3-15.  Glide polar graph.  

Airspeed and sink rate must both be in the same units. The  example in  Figure 3-14  uses knots. The minimum sink speed  is the airspeed at which the glider loses altitude at the lowest  rate. It can be determined from the polar by locating the point  on the graph with the lowest sink rate and reading off the  corresponding airspeed.  [Figure 3-16]  

The best glide speed is the airspeed at which, in still air, the  glider achieves its best glide ratio. It is also known as the  best lift/drag (L/D) speed. This can be determined from the  polar by drawing a line from the origin that is tangential to  the curve (e.g., just touching).  [Figure 3-17]  The point of  contact is the best glide speed; the glide ratio at this speed  can be calculated as previously described. In still air, the  glider should be flown at this speed to get from A to B with  minimum height loss.

Figure 3-17.  The glider polar graph helps determine the glider’s  best glide speed.  

Increasing the mass of a glider by adding water ballast,  for example, shifts the glide polar down and to the  right.  [Figure 3-18]  The minimum sink rate is therefore  increased, so as expected, the extra weight makes it harder  to climb in thermals. However, the best glide ratio remains  approximately the same, but now occurs at a higher airspeed.  Therefore, if the thermals are strong enough to compensate  for the poor climb performance, then water ballast allows a  faster inter-thermal cruise. This results in greater distances  being traveled per time interval.

# Aspect Ratio  

The aspect ratio is another factor that affects the lift and drag  created by a wing. Aspect ratio is determined by dividing the  wingspan (from wingtip to wingtip), by the average wing chord.  

Glider wings have a high aspect ratio, as shown in  Figure 3-19 High aspect ratio wings produce a comparably high amount of  lift at low angles of attack with less induced drag.  

# Weight  

Weight is the third force that acts on a glider in flight. Weight  opposes lift and acts vertically through the CG of the glider.  Gravitational pull provides the force necessary to move a  glider through the air since a portion of the weight vector of  a glider is directed forward.  

# Thrust  

Thrust is the forward force that propels a self-launching glider  through the air. Self-launching gliders have engine-driven  propellers that provide this thrust. Unpowered gliders have  an outside force, such as a towplane, winch, or automobile,  to launch the glider. Airborne gliders obtain thrust from  conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy.  

# Three Axes of Rotation  

The glider is maneuvered around three axes of rotation: yaw  (vertical), lateral, and longitudinal. They rotate around one  

![](images/92b974c9b920756a5966aaf27087917d8032bae7eae74f2d45ec01f8516313e6.jpg)  
Figure 3-19.  Aspect ratio.  

central point in the glider called the CG. This point is the  center of the glider’s total weight and varies with the loading  of the glider.  

Yaw is movement around the vertical axis, which can be  represented by an imaginary straight line drawn vertically  through the CG. Moving the rudder left or right causes the  glider to yaw the nose to the left or right. Moving the ailerons  left or right to bank moves the glider around the longitudinal  axis. This axis would appear if a line were drawn through the  center of the fuselage from nose to tail. Pulling the stick back  or pushing it forward, raising or lowering the nose, controls  the pitch of the glider or its movement around the lateral axis.  The lateral axis could be seen if a line were drawn from one  side of the fuselage to the other through the CG.  [Figure 3-20]  

# Stability  

A glider is in equilibrium when all of its forces are in balance.  Stability is defined as the glider’s ability to maintain a  uniform flight condition and return to that condition after  being disturbed. Often during flight, gliders encounter  equilibrium-changing pitch disturbances. These can occur in  the form of vertical gusts, a sudden shift in CG, or deflection  of the controls by the pilot. For example, a stable glider would  display a tendency to return to equilibrium after encountering  a force that causes the nose to pitch up.  

Static stability and dynamic stability are two types of  stability a glider displays in flight. Static stability is the initial  tendency to return to a state of equilibrium when disturbed  from that state. The three types of static stability are positive,  negative, and neutral. When a glider demonstrates positive  static stability, it tends to return to equilibrium. A glider  demonstrating negative static stability displays a tendency  to increase its displacement. Gliders that demonstrate  neutral static stability have neither the tendency to return  to equilibrium nor the tendency to continue displacement.  

Dynamic stability describes a glider’s motion and time  required for a response to static stability. In other words,  dynamic stability describes the manner in which a glider  oscillates when responding to static stability. A glider that  displays positive dynamic and static stability reduces its  oscillations with time. A glider demonstrating negative  dynamic stability is the opposite situation; its oscillations  increase in amplitude with time following a displacement.  A glider displaying neutral dynamic stability experiences  oscillations, which remain at the same amplitude without  increasing or decreasing over time.  Figure 3-21  illustrates  the various types of dynamic stability.  

Both static and dynamic stability are particularly important for  pitch control about the lateral axis. Measurement of stability  about this axis is known as longitudinal stability. Gliders are  designed to be slightly nose heavy in order to improve their  longitudinal stability. This causes the glider to tend to nose  down during normal flight. The horizontal stabilizer on the tail  is mounted at a slightly negative AOA to offset this tendency.  When a dynamically stable glider oscillates, the amplitude  of the oscillations should reduce through each cycle and  eventually settle down to a speed at which the downward force  on the tail exactly offsets the tendency to dive.  [Figure 3-22]  

Adjusting the trim assists in maintaining a desired  pitch attitude. A glider with positive static and dynamic  longitudinal stability tends to return to the trimmed pitch  attitude when the force that displaced it is removed. If a glider  displays negative stability, oscillations increase over time. If  uncorrected, negative stability can induce loads exceeding  the design limitations of the glider.

Figure 3-22.  Use of the horizontal stabilizer angle to offset the natural tendency of a glider to nose down.  

Another factor that is critical to the longitudinal stability of a  glider is its loading in relation to the CG. The CG of the glider  is the point at which the total force of gravity is considered  to act. When the glider is improperly loaded so it exceeds  the aft CG limit, it loses longitudinal stability. As airspeed  decreases, the nose of a glider rises. To recover, control inputs  must be applied to force the nose down to return to a level  flight attitude. It is possible that the glider could be loaded  so far aft of the approved limits that control inputs are not  sufficient to stop the nose from pitching up. If this were the  case, the glider could enter a spin from which recovery would  be impossible. Loading a glider with the CG too far forward  is also hazardous. In extreme cases, the glider may not have  enough pitch control to hold the nose up during an approach  to a landing. For these reasons, it is important to ensure that  the glider is within weight and balance limits prior to each  flight. Proper loading of a glider and the importance of CG  is discussed further in Chapter 5, Performance Limitations.  

# Flutter  

Another factor that can affect the ability to control the glider  is flutter. Flutter occurs when rapid vibrations are induced  through the control surfaces while the glider is traveling at  high speeds. Looseness in the control surfaces can result in  flutter while flying near maximum speed. Another factor  that can reduce the airspeed at which flutter can occur is a  disturbance to the balance of the control surfaces. If vibrations  are felt in the control surfaces, reduce the airspeed.  

# Lateral Stability  

Another type of stability that describes the glider’s tendency  to return to wings-level flight following a displacement is  lateral stability. When a glider is rolled into a bank, it has a  tendency to sideslip in the direction of the bank. For example,  due to a gust of wind, the glider wing is lifted and the glider  starts to roll. The angle of attack on the downward going  wing is increased because the wing is moving down and  now the air is moving up past it. This causes the lift on this  wing to increase. On the upward going wing, the opposite is  occurring. The angle of attack is reduced because the wing  is moving up and the air is moving down past it. Lift on this  wing is therefore reduced. This does produce a countertorque  that damps out the rolling motion, but does not roll the glider  back to wings level as the effect stops when the glider stops.  [Figure 3-23]  To obtain lateral stability, dihedral is designed  into the wings.  

Dihedral is the upward angle of the wings from a horizontal  (front/rear view) axis of the plane. As a glider flies along  

![](images/c52fa493b73282e577abaccacae1add01bc12a957f06295643bb7b0ff31bafde.jpg)  
Figure 3-23.  Lateral stability.  

and encounters turbulence, the dihedral provides positive  lateral stability by providing more lift for the lower wing  and reducing the lift on the raised wing. As one wing lowers,  it becomes closer to perpendicular to the surface and level.  Because it is closer to level and perpendicular to the weight  force, the lift produced directly opposes the force of weight.  This must be instantly compared to the higher and now  more canted wing referenced to the force of weight. The  higher wing’s lift relative to the force of weight is now less  because of the vector angle. This imbalance of lift causes the  lower wing to rise as the higher descends until lift equalizes,  resulting in level flight.  [Figure 3-24]  

# Turning Flight  

Before a glider turns, it must first overcome inertia, or its  tendency to continue in a straight line. A pilot creates the  necessary turning force by using the ailerons to bank the  glider so that the direction of total lift is inclined. This divides  the force of lift into two components; one component acts  vertically to oppose weight, while the other acts horizontally  to oppose centrifugal force. The latter is the horizontal  component of lift.  [Figure 3-25]  

To maintain attitude with the horizon during a turn, glider  pilots need to increase back pressure on the control stick. The  horizontal component of lift creates a force directed inward  toward the center of rotation, which is known as centripetal  force.  [Figure 3-26]  This center-seeking force causes the glider  to turn. Since centripetal force works against the tendency of  the aircraft to continue in a straight line, inertia tends to oppose  centripetal force toward the outside of the turn. This opposing  force is known as centrifugal force. In reality, centrifugal force  is not a true aerodynamic force; it is an apparent force that  results from the effect of inertia during the turn.  

# Load Factors  

The preceding sections only briefly considered some of the  practical points of the principles of turning flight. However,  with the responsibilities of the pilot and the safety of  passengers, the competent pilot must have a well-founded  concept of the forces that act on the glider during turning  flight and the advantageous use of these forces, as well as  the operating limitations of the particular glider. Any force  applied to a glider to deflect its flight from a straight line  produces a stress on its structure; the amount of this force is  called load factor.  

![](images/a3535d30eb3a3bad2d2ab61d0c497eea2840a3a607218fe1dd4fe7c27265198c.jpg)

Figure 3-26.  Centripetal force is a force that makes a body follow  a curved path.  

A load factor is the ratio of the total air load acting on the  glider to the gross weight of the glider. A glider in flight with  a load factor of one does not mean the glider is accelerating;  it means the lift on the aircraft is the same as in straight- and-level flight. Load factor may be positive or negative,  dependent on the current flightpath.  

A load factor of three means that the total load on a glider’s  structure is three times its gross weight. Gravity load factors  are usually expressed in terms of “G”—that is, a load factor  of three may be spoken of as three Gs, or a load factor of  four as four Gs. A load factor of one, or   $1~\mathrm{G}.$  , represents  conditions in straight-and-level flight, in which the lift is  equal to the weight. Therefore, two Gs would be two times  the normal weight. Gliders may be designed to withstand  stress of up to nine Gs.  

It is interesting to note that in subjecting a glider to three Gs  in a pullup from a dive, the pilot is pressed down into the  seat with a force equal to three times the person’s weight.  Thus, an idea of the magnitude of the load factor obtained in  any maneuver can be determined by considering the degree  to which the pilot is pressed down into the seat. Since the  operating speed of modern gliders has increased significantly,  this effect has become so pronounced that it is a primary  consideration in the design of the structure for all gliders.  

If attempting to improve turn performance by increasing  angle of bank while maintaining airspeed, pay close attention  to glider limitations due to the effects of increasing the load  factor. Load factor is defined as the ratio of the load supported  by the glider’s wings to the actual weight of the aircraft and  its contents. A glider in stabilized, wings-level flight has a  load factor of one. Load factor increases rapidly as the angle  of bank increases due to increase wing loading.  [Figure 3-27] With the structural design of gliders planned to withstand  only a certain amount of overload, knowledge of load factors  has become essential for all pilots. Load factors are important  to the pilot for two distinct reasons:  

1.	 It is possible for a pilot to impose an obviously  dangerous overload on the glider structures. 2.	 Increased load factor increases the stalling speed,  making stalls possible at seemingly safe flight speeds  due to increased wing loading.  

In a turn at constant speed, the AOA must be increased to  furnish the extra lift necessary to overcome the centrifugal  force and inertia opposing the turn. As the bank angle  increases, AOA must also increase to provide the required lift.  The result of increasing the AOA is a stall when the critical  AOA is exceeded in a turn.  [Figure 3-28]  

![](images/12066ca8c50f571e2b15bdf060b18d975a7380c7adddbcafd516673dec242aae.jpg)  
Figure 3-27.  A glider’s stall speed increases as the bank angle  increases. For example, a  $60^{\circ}$   angle of bank causes a 40 percent  increase in the glider’s stall speed.  

![](images/2f32dd49fa2bc28ba77a1b5ed04704f6376e96cf4cd2adb1bd52fcb604947387.jpg)  
Figure 3-28.  The loads placed on a glider increase as the angle of  bank increases.  

# Rate of Turn  

Rate of turn refers to the amount of time it takes for a glider  to turn a specified number of degrees. If flown at the same  airspeed and angle of bank, every glider turns at the same  rate. If airspeed increases and the angle of bank remains  the same, the rate of turn decreases. Conversely, a constant  airspeed coupled with an angle of bank increase results in a  higher rate of turn.  

# Radius of Turn  

The amount of horizontal distance an aircraft uses to complete  a turn is referred to as the radius of turn. The radius of turn  at any given bank angle varies directly with the square of the  airspeed. Therefore, if the airspeed of the glider were doubled,  the radius of the turn would be four times greater. Although  the radius of turn is also dependent on a glider’s airspeed and  angle of bank, the relationship is the opposite of rate of turn.  As the glider’s airspeed is increased with the angle of bank  held constant, the radius of turn increases. On the other hand,  if the angle of bank increases and the airspeed remains the  same, the radius of turn is decreased.  [Figure 3-29]  When  flying in thermals, the radius of turn is an important factor as  it helps to gain the maximum altitude. A smaller turn radius  enables a glider to fly closer to the fastest rising core of the  thermal and gain altitude more quickly.  

# Turn Coordination  

It is important that rudder and aileron inputs are coordinated  during a turn so maximum glider performance can be  maintained. If too little rudder is applied, or if rudder is  applied too late, the result is a slip. Too much rudder, or  rudder applied before aileron, results in a skid. Both skids  and slips swing the fuselage of the glider into the relative  wind, creating additional parasite drag, which reduces lift  and airspeed. Although this increased drag caused by a slip  can be useful during approach to landing to steepen the  approach path and counteract a crosswind, it decreases glider  performance during other phases of flight.  

When rolling into a turn, the aileron on the inside of the  turn is raised and the aileron on the outside of the turn is  lowered. The lowered aileron on the outside wing increases  lift by increasing wing camber and produces more lift for that  wing. Since induced drag is a byproduct of lift, the outside  wing also produces more drag than the inside wing. This  causes adverse yaw, a yawing tendency toward the outside  of the turn. Coordinated use of rudder and aileron corrects  for adverse yaw and aileron drag. Adverse yaw in gliders  can be more pronounced due to the much longer wings as  compared to an airplane of equal weight. The longer wings  constitute longer lever arms for the adverse yaw forces to act  on the glider. Therefore, more rudder movement is necessary  to counteract the adverse yaw and have a coordinated turn.  

# Slips  

A slip is a descent with one wing lowered and the glider’s  longitudinal axis at an angle to the flightpath. It may be used  for one or both of two purposes: to steepen the approach path  without increasing the airspeed, as would be the case if a dive  were used, or used to make the glider move sideways through  the air to counteract the drift that results from a crosswind.  

Formerly, slips were used as a normal means of controlling  landing descents to short or obstructed fields, but they are  now primarily used in the performance of crosswind and  short-field landings. With the installation of wing flaps  and effective spoilers on modern gliders, the use of slips to  steepen or control the angle of descent is no longer the only  procedure available. However, pilots still need skill in the  performance of forward slips to correct for possible errors  in judgment of the landing approach.  

The shape of the glider’s wing planform can greatly affect  the slip. If the glider has a rectangular wing planform, the slip  has little effect on the lift production of the wing other than  the wing area being obscured by the fuselage vortices. The  direction of the relative wind to the wing has the same effect  on both wings so no inequalities of lift form. However, if the  wing is tapered or has leading edge aft sweep, then the relative  wind has a large effect on the production of lift.  

![](images/25681f06946a1ad6e4076c4609d3fb85e6fd7fbf8ab430b71b24c570caed13f1.jpg)  
Figure 3-29.  A glider’s radius of turn as compared to angle of bank.  

If a glider with tapered wings, as shown in  Figure 3-14,  were  to begin a slip to the left with the left wing lower, the left  wing will have a relative wind more aligned with its chord  line and effectively higher airflow (airspeed) that generates  more lift as compared to the higher right wing with angled  relative wind, resulting in lower effective airflow (airspeed)  over that wing. This differential in airflow or relative airspeed  of the wings when taken to the extremes of the flight envelope  results in the higher wing stalling and often an inverted spin.  

Depending on the exact wing shape, an elliptical wing can  have characteristics more like a tapered wing.  [Figure 3-14] Pilots should always consult the GFM and know what the  gliders limitations are concerning slips.  

The use of slips has limitations. Some pilots may try to  lose altitude by violent slipping, rather than by smoothly  maneuvering, exercising good judgment, and using only a  slight or moderate slip. In short-field landings, this erratic  practice invariably leads to trouble since enough excess speed  may prevent touching down anywhere near the proper point,  and very often results in overshooting the entire field.  

If a slip is used during the last portion of a final approach,  the longitudinal axis of the glider must be aligned with the  runway just prior to touchdown so that the glider touches  down headed in the direction in which it is moving over  the runway. This requires timely action to modify the slip  and align the glider’s longitudinal axis with its direction of  travel over the ground at the instant of touchdown. Failure  to accomplish this imposes severe sideloads on the landing  gear and imparts violent ground looping tendencies.  

Discontinuing the slip is accomplished by leveling the wings  and simultaneously releasing the rudder pressure, while  readjusting the pitch attitude to the normal glide attitude. If  the pressure on the rudder is released abruptly, the nose swings  too quickly into line and the glider tends to acquire excess speed.  

Because of the location of the pitot tube and static vents,  airspeed indicators in some gliders may have considerable  error when the glider is in a slip. The pilot must be aware of  this possibility and recognize a properly performed slip by  the attitude of the glider, the sound of the airflow, and the  feel of the flight controls.  

# Forward Slip  

The forward slip is a slip in which the glider’s direction of  motion is the same as before the slip was begun.  [Figure 3-30] The primary purpose of a forward slip is to dissipate altitude  without increasing the glider’s speed, particularly in gliders  not equipped with flaps, or if the spoilers are inoperative.  There are many circumstances requiring the use of forward  slips, such as a landing approach over obstacles and short- field landings, in which it is always wise to allow an extra  margin of altitude for safety in the original estimate of the  approach. In the latter case, if the inaccuracy of the approach  is confirmed by excess altitude when nearing the boundary of  the selected field, slipping can dissipate the excess altitude. If there is any crosswind, the slip is much more effective if  made toward the wind.  

Assuming the glider is originally in straight flight, the wing  on the side toward which the slip is to be made should be  lowered by use of the ailerons. Simultaneously, the airplane’s  nose must be yawed in the opposite direction by applying  opposite rudder so that the glider’s longitudinal axis is at an  angle to its original flightpath. The degree to which the nose  is yawed in the opposite direction from the bank should be  such that the original ground track is maintained. The nose  should also be raised as necessary to prevent the airspeed  from increasing.  

![](images/317e6349aafdc4b8d8a1f968c40acbe3466605697b06953361c7ccd892bf306c.jpg)  
Figure 3-30.  A comparison of a forward slip to a sideslip.  

Note: Forward slips with wing flaps extended should not  be done in gliders wherein the manufacturer’s operating  instructions prohibit such operation.  

# Sideslip  

A sideslip, as distinguished from a forward slip, is one during  which the glider’s longitudinal axis remains parallel to the  original flightpath, but in which the flightpath changes direction  according to the steepness of the bank. To perform a sideslip,  the upwind wing is lowered, and simultaneously the opposite  rudder is applied to maintain the landing area alignment.  The sideslip is important in counteracting wind drift during  crosswind landings and is discussed in a later chapter.  

The dihedral angle of the wings works to add lateral stability  to the airframe and ease the pilot’s tasking to correct for  upsets. As the glider flies along, turbulence may upset the  balance and raise one wing and roll the glider about the  longitudinal axis. As the wing rises, the vertical lift vector  decreases while the horizontal component of the wing’s  lifting force increases. As the other wing descends, the lifting  force vertical component increases while the horizontal  component decreases. This imbalance is designed so the  airframe returns to level without pilot input. Depending on the  airflows, the AOA on the wings may or may not be a factor.  If the air on one wing is descending (sink) and the air on the  other wing is ascending (lift) both wings will have different  relative winds, thus different AOAs and developed lift.  

# Stalls  

It is important to remember that a stall can occur at any airspeed  and at any flight attitude. A stall occurs when the critical AOA  is exceeded.  [Figure   $3–3I J$   During a stall, the wings still  support some of the aircraft’s weight. If the wings did not, it  would accelerate according to Newton’s Second Law. The stall  speed of a glider can be affected by many factors, including  weight, load factor due to maneuvering, and environmental  conditions. As the weight of the glider increases, a higher AOA  is required to maintain flight at the same airspeed since more  lift is required to support the increase in weight. This is why  a heavily loaded glider stalls at a higher airspeed than when  lightly loaded. The manner in which this weight is distributed  also affects stall speed. For example, a forward CG creates a  situation that requires the tail to produce a greater downforce to  balance the aircraft. The result of this configuration requires the  wings to produce more lift than if the CG were located further  aft. Therefore, a more forward CG also increases stall speed.  

Environmental factors also can affect stall speed. Snow, ice,  or frost accumulation on the wing’s surface can increase the  weight of the wing, in addition to changing the wing shape  and disrupting the airflow, all of which increase stall speed.  Turbulence is another environmental factor that can affect a  glider’s stall speed. The unpredictable nature of turbulence  can cause a glider to stall suddenly and abruptly at a higher  airspeed than it would in stable conditions. Turbulence has a  strong impact on the stall speed of a glider because the vertical  gusts change the direction of the relative wind and abruptly  increase the AOA. During landing in gusty conditions, it is  important to increase the approach airspeed by half of the  gust spread value in order to maintain a wide margin above  stall. For example, if the winds were 10 knots gusting to 15  knots, it would be prudent to add 2.5 knots   $((15-10)\div2$   $=2.5)$  ) to the approach speed. This practice usually ensures  a safe margin to guard against stalls at very low altitudes.  

# Spins  

If the aircraft is not stalled, it cannot spin. A spin can be  defined as an aggravated stall that results in the glider  descending in a helical, or corkscrew, path. A spin is a  complex, uncoordinated flight maneuver in which the wings  are unequally stalled. Upon entering a spin, the wing that  is more completely stalled drops before the other, and the  nose of the aircraft yaws in the direction of the low wing.  [Figure 3-32]  

![](images/7f77aa6e1ffa6f5d8c45d860a5c6864a5d6b375bb235fff41863e790a4ccc2de.jpg)

Figure 3-32.  The relative coefficients of lift and drag for each wing  during a spin. Note that the ascending wing experiences more lift  and less drag. The opposite wing is forced down and back due to  less lift and increased drag.  

The cause of a spin is stalled airflow over one wing before  airflow stalling over the other wing. This is a result of  uncoordinated flight with unequal airflows over the wings.  

Spins occur in uncoordinated slow flight and high rate turns  (overbanking for airspeed). The lack of coordination is  normally caused by too much or not enough rudder control  for the amount of aileron being used. If the stall recovery is  not promptly initiated, the glider is likely to enter a full stall  that may develop into a spin. Spins that occur as the result  of uncoordinated flight usually rotate in the direction of the  rudder being applied, regardless of the raised wing. When  entering a slipping turn, holding opposite aileron and rudder,  the resultant spin usually occurs in the direction opposite of  the aileron already applied. In a skidding turn in which both  aileron and rudder are applied in the same direction, rotation is  also in the direction of rudder application. Glider pilots should  always be aware of the type of wing forms on their aircraft  and the stall characteristics of that wing in various maneuvers.  

Spins are normally placed in three categories, as shown  in  Figure 3-33 . The most common is the upright, or erect,  spin, which is characterized by a slightly nose-down rolling  and yawing motion in the same direction. An inverted spin  involves the aircraft spinning upside down with the yaw and  roll occurring in opposite directions. A third type of spin, the  

![](images/f081435458dd9f8127736cc6ebeb2fe6546aa21ec528b8d55147f6f0e4ec76b1.jpg)  
Figure 3-33.  A glider’s stall speed increases as the bank angle increases. In a spin, one wing is more deeply stalled than the other.  

flat spin, is the most hazardous of all spins. In a flat spin, the  glider yaws around the vertical axis at a pitch attitude nearly  level with the horizon. A flat spin often has a very high rate of  rotation; the recovery is difficult, and sometimes impossible.  If a glider is properly loaded within its CG limits, entry into a  flat spin should not occur. Erect spins and flat spins can also  be inverted. The entry, wing form, and CG usually determine  the type of spin resulting from an uncoordinated wing stall.  

Since spins normally occur when a glider is flown in an  uncoordinated manner at lower airspeeds, coordinated use of  the flight controls is important. It is critical that pilots learn  to recognize and recover from the first sign of a stall or spin.  Entering a spin near the ground, especially during the landing  pattern, is usually fatal.  [Figure 3-33]  A pilot must learn to  recognize  the warning signs, especially during the approach  and landing phase in a crosswind. A crosswind resulting in  a tailwind on the base leg may lead the pilot to tighten the  turn using rudder, or too steep a turn for the airspeed. An  uncoordinated turn could lead to the upper wing exceeding  its critical AOA before the lower wing, which could result  in a very high rate of roll towards the upper wing as the  upper wing stalls. If an excessive steep turn is attempted, the  glider may roll towards the inside wing or the outside wing  depending on the exact trim state at the instant of the stall.  Situational awareness of position to final approach should  be part of a before-landing routine.  

During flight, the downwash of the airstream causes the  relative wind to be inclined downward in the vicinity of the  wing. This is called the average relative wind. The angle  between the free airstream relative wind and the average  relative wind is the induced AOA. In effect, the greater the  downward deflection of the airstream, the higher the induced  AOA and the higher the induced drag. Ground effect restricts  the downward deflection of the airstream, decreasing both  induced AOA and induced drag.  

Ground effect, in addition to the decrease in wind due to  surface friction and other terrain features upwind of the  landing area, can greater increase the landing distance of  a glider. A glider pilot, especially a visiting pilot, should  inquire about local effects from local pilots to enhance flight  planning and safe landings.  

# Ground Effect  

Ground effect is a reduction in induced drag for the same  amount of lift produced. Within one wingspan above the  ground, the decrease in induced drag enables the glider to fly  at a lower airspeed. In ground effect, a lower AOA is required  to produce the same amount of lift. Ground effect enables the  glider to fly near the ground at a lower airspeed and causes  the glider to float as it approaches the touchdown point.  

During takeoff and landing, the ground alters the three- dimensional airflow pattern around the glider. The result is  a decrease in downwash and a reduction in wingtip vortices.  Upwash and downwash refer to the effect an airfoil has on  the free airstream. Upwash is the deflection of the oncoming  airstream upward and over the wing. Downwash is the  downward deflection of the airstream as it passes over the  wing and past the trailing edge.  

# Chapter 4 Flight Instruments  

# Introduction  

Flight instruments in the glider cockpit provide information  regarding the glider’s direction, altitude, airspeed, and  performance. The categories include pitot-static, magnetic,  gyroscopic, electrical, electronic, and self-contained. This  categorization includes instruments that are sensitive to  gravity (G-loading) and centrifugal forces. Instruments can  be a basic set used typically in training aircraft or a more  advanced set used in the high performance sailplane for cross- country and competition flying. To obtain basic introductory  information about common aircraft instruments, please  refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25).  

Instruments displaying airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed  are part of the pitot-static system. Heading instruments  display magnetic direction by sensing the earth’s magnetic  field. Performance instruments, using gyroscopic principles,  display the aircraft attitude, heading, and rates of turn. Unique  to the glider cockpit is the variometer, which is part of the  pitot-static system. Electronic instruments using computer and  global positioning system (GPS) technology provide pilots  with moving map displays, electronic airspeed and altitude,  air mass conditions, and other functions relative to flight  management. Examples of self-contained instruments and  indicators that are useful to the pilot include the yaw string,  inclinometer, and outside air temperature gauge (OAT).  

# Pitot-Static Instruments  

There are two major divisions in the pitot-static system:  

1. 	 Impact air pressure due to forward motion (flight)  captured in the pitot tube transferred to instruments  by way of air pressure lines or tubing. 2.	 Static or free air pressure sensed at static air ports  designed to be free of motion induced pressure  variations. This reference pressure is necessary  because the free pressure of the atmosphere decreases  as altitude increases and changes due to the current  weather (barometric) pressure variations. This static  or free air pressure is transferred to instruments by  way of the static pressure lines or tubing.  

# Impact and Static Pressure Lines  

The impact air pressure (air striking the glider because  of its forward motion) is taken from the pitot tube, which  is mounted on either the nose or the vertical stabilizer.  [Figure 4-1]  Pitot tubes are aligned with the relative wind.  These locations minimize air disturbance or turbulence during  glider flight through the air.  

![](images/41f6896db8e91a55220f778ef9e42981407019364c5eba4385098639948251f9.jpg)  
Figure 4-1.  A pitot tube is often mounted in the glider’s nose or  the vertical fin, the open end of which is exposed directly to the  oncoming airflow.  

When a glider is in flight, the oncoming air tries to flow into  the open end of the pitot tube.  [Figure   $_{4-2J}$   Connecting a  diaphragm to the back end of the pitot tube means that the air  flowing in has nowhere to go. The pressure in the diaphragm  rises until it is high enough to prevent any further air from  

![](images/c98aa67d57d6e9698ee3f23759b440cd52b65992211aaa9c2b2b1e187b041314.jpg)

entering. Increasing the airspeed of the glider causes the  force exerted by the oncoming air to rise. More air is able to  push its way into the diaphragm and the pressure within the  diaphragm increases. The pressure inside the diaphragm to  oncoming airflow increases as airspeed increases.  

The static pressure (pressure of the still air) is taken from  the static line that is attached to a port, or ports, mounted  flush with the side of the fuselage or tube mounted on the  vertical stabilizer.  [Figure 4-3]  Gliders using a fuselage flush  mounted static source have two vents, one on each side of the  fuselage. This compensates for variation of static pressure  due to changes in glider attitude and air turbulence.  

![](images/852fbdf5c1d1f9eb09302b90965e88e3c3494009a94a8df4e924d3a3f6fc7d77.jpg)  
Figure 4-3.  Static ports mounted flush with the side of the fuselage  or tube mounted on the vertical stabilizer.  

The openings of both the pitot tube and the static port(s)  should be checked during the preflight inspection to ensure  they are free from obstructions. Clogged, or partially clogged,  openings should be cleaned by a certificated mechanic.  Blowing into these openings is not recommended, because  this could damage flight instruments.  

# Airspeed Indicator  

The airspeed indicator displays the indicated airspeed  (IAS) of the glider through the air.  [Figure 4-4]  Some  airspeed indicator dials provide color-coded arcs that depict  permissible airspeed ranges for different phases of flight. The  

![](images/509db1d482a5c408637f3d4a26ee3177dd481d4483e55a85bd053a1c93adabbb.jpg)  
Figure 4-4.  Airspeed indicator.  

upper (top) and lower (bottom) limits of the arcs correspond  to airspeed limitations for specific gliders configurations  which are discussed later in this chapter. These speed  limitations are set by the manufacturer.  Figure 4-5  shows  the anatomy of the airspeed indicator and where the pitot  and static pressure inlets are located.  

The airspeed indicator depends on both pitot pressure and  static pressure.  [Figure 4-6]  When pitot pressure and static  pressure are the same, zero airspeed is indicated. As pitot  pressure becomes progressively greater than static pressure,  airspeed is indicated by the needle pointing to the speed  scale. The airspeed instrument contains a diaphragm that  senses differential pitot and static pressure. The diaphragm  expands or contracts according to the difference of static and  pitot pressures; this movement drives the needle (airspeed  needle pointer) on the face of the instrument.  [Figure 4-7]  

# The Effects of Altitude on the Airspeed Indicator  

Like pressure, air density also decreases with altitude. The  airspeed indicator’s diaphragm is calibrated to correctly  display airspeed when the air through which the aircraft  is moving is of average sea level density. Above sea level,  due to the lower air density, the buildup of pressure in  the diaphragm is lower, and the airspeed indicator reads  artificially low. The higher the altitude above sea level, the  more erroneous the airspeed indicator value.  [Figure 4-8]  

# Types of Airspeed  

There are three kinds of airspeed that the pilot should  understand: IAS, calibrated airspeed (CAS), and true airspeed  (TAS).  [Figure 4-9]  

# Indicated Airspeed (IAS)  

IAS is the direct instrument reading obtained from the  airspeed indicator, uncorrected for variations in atmospheric  density, installation error, or instrument error.  Figure 4-10  

![](images/977ceffb93fdb747120a8a66558905ab431b796d31633e68d97695ff743cd366.jpg)  
Figure 4-6.  The functionality of the airspeed indicator depends on  both pitot and static pressure.  

shows that the IAS at which a glider stalls in steady wings- level flight does not vary with altitude. However, pilots must  remember that different gliders stall at different speeds. The  IAS shown in  Figure  $_{4-l O}$   may not be the stall speed for each  particular glider.  

The IAS at which never exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$   is reached  decreases with altitude. The glider flight manual (GFM)  should include a table, such as the one shown in  Figure 4-11, that details how   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   should be reduced with altitude. These  figures vary from glider to glider; therefore, pilots should  always refer to the manual specific to the glider they are flying,  which should show a chart similar to the one in  Figure 4-11 .  

# Calibrated Airspeed (CAS)  

CAS is IAS corrected for installation and instrument error.  Although manufacturers attempt to keep airspeed errors to a  minimum, it is impossible to eliminate all errors throughout  the airspeed operating range. At certain airspeeds and with  certain flap/spoiler settings, the installation and instrument  error may be significant. The error is generally greatest at  low airspeeds. In the cruising and higher airspeed ranges,  IAS and CAS are approximately the same.  

It is important to refer to the airspeed calibration chart  to correct for possible airspeed errors because airspeed  limitations, such as those found on the color-coded face  of the airspeed indicator, on placards in the cockpit, or in  

![](images/8d11d352b0c288363c93ffb76a6e0a4e7ec802d31021e9d3096884b57faa91a9.jpg)

the GFM or Pilot’s Operating Handbook (GFM/POH), are  usually CAS. Some manufacturers use IAS rather than CAS  to denote the airspeed limitations mentioned. The airspeed  indicator should be calibrated periodically.  

Dirt, dust, ice, or snow collecting at the mouth of the pitot  tube may obstruct air passage and prevent correct indications.  Vibrations may also destroy the sensitivity of the diaphragm.  

# True Airspeed (TAS)  

TAS is the true speed at which the aircraft is moving through  the air. The airspeed indicator is calibrated to indicate TAS  only under standard atmospheric conditions at sea level  (29.92 inches of mercury  $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$   and  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ). Because  air density decreases with an increase in altitude, the glider  must be flown faster at higher altitudes to cause the same  pressure difference between pitot impact pressure and static  pressure. Therefore, for a given TAS, IAS decreases as  altitude increases; for a given IAS, TAS increases with an  increase in altitude.  

Fortunately for the pilot, the amount by which the airspeed  indicator underreads approximately cancels out the air  density related changes to the glider’s flight dynamics. This  means that if the IAS at the point of stall at 1,000 feet in  steady wings-level flight is 40 knots, then the IAS at 20,000  feet at the point of the stall is also 40 knots, despite the fact  that the stall is actually occurring at a TAS that is 14 knots  higher. Therefore, the pilot needs to remember only one  set of numbers that work at all altitudes. A decrease in air  density with altitude also affects a glider’s flight dynamics.  For example, a glider that stalls at a TAS of 40 knots in  steady wings-level flight at 1,000 feet stalls at a TAS of 54  knots at 20,000 feet. Consider the inconvenience that this  would cause if the airspeed indicator did actually display  TAS. The pilot would need to use quick reference cards  continuously to look up the stall speed, best L/D speed,  and minimum sink speed for the current altitude—not a

Figure 4-9.  The three types of airspeed are IAS, CAS, and TAS.  

![Figure 4-10.  In steady wings-level flight, IAS does not vary with altitude.  ](images/666a5e1ff38657b9c61159bbfe70a21863145f16ba0baad8491903f284294cba.jpg)  

![Figure 4-11.  IAS at which  $V_{N E}$   is reached decreases with altitude.  ](images/7e713242ed33be7b8b64e78a98e8b70bdeaaf04deba5ce416b22a3e1b6728d49.jpg)  

particularly convenient thing to do while trying to fly.  Figure 4-10  shows how steady, wings-level flight stall  speed is affected by different altitudes.  Figure 4-10  is only  an example, and the figures used in it do not pertain to all  gliders. For specific stall speeds, always refer to the POH  of the glider that is being flown.  

A pilot can find TAS by two methods. The first method,  which is more accurate, involves using a flight computer.  In this method, the CAS is corrected for temperature and  pressure variation by using the airspeed correction scale on  the computer. A second method, which is a rule of thumb,  can be used to compute the approximate TAS. This is done  by adding to the IAS 2 percent of the IAS for each 1,000  feet of altitude.  

# Airspeed Indicator Markings  

Aircraft weighing 12,500 pounds or less, manufactured after  1945 and certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA), are required to have airspeed indicators that conform  to a standard color-coded marking system.  [Figure 4-4]  This  system enables the pilot to determine, at a glance, certain  airspeed limitations that are important to the safe operation  of the aircraft. For example, if during the execution of a  maneuver, the pilot notes that the airspeed needle is in the  yellow arc and is rapidly approaching the red line, immediate  corrective action to reduce the airspeed should be taken. It  is essential that the pilot use smooth control pressure at high  airspeeds to avoid severe stressors upon the glider structure.  

The following is a description of what the standard color- code markings are on an airspeed indicator and how they  correspond to maneuvers and airspeeds.  

•	 The white arc—flap operating range •	 The lower limit of the white arc—stalling speed with  the wing flaps and landing gear in the landing position. •	 The upper limit of the white arc—maximum flaps- extended speed. This is the highest airspeed at which  the pilot should extend full flaps. If flaps are operated  at higher airspeeds, severe strain or structural failure  could result.  •	 The lower limit of the green arc—stalling speed with  the wing flaps and landing gear retracted.  •	 The upper limit of the green arc—maximum structural  cruising speed. This is the maximum speed for normal  operations.  

•	 The yellow arc—caution range. The pilot should avoid  this area unless in smooth air. •	 The red line—never-exceed speed. This is the maximum  speed at which the glider can be operated in smooth air.  This speed should never be exceeded intentionally.  

# Other Airspeed Limitations  

There are other important airspeed limitations not marked on  the face of the airspeed indicator. These speeds are generally  found on placards  [Figure 4-12]  in the view of the pilot and  in the GFM/POH.  

•	 Maneuvering speed (Va)—maximum speed at which  the limit load can be imposed (either by gusts or  full defection of the control surfaces for one cycle)  without causing structural damage. If rough air or  severe turbulence is encountered during flight, the  airspeed should be reduced to maneuvering speed  or less to minimize the stress on the glider structure.  Maneuvering speed is not marked on the airspeed  indicator. For gliders, if there is a rough airspeed   $(\mathrm{V_{b})}$    limitation published the pilot should be below that  speed for maximum gust intensity. •	 Landing gear operating speed—maximum speed for  extending or retracting the landing gear if using glider  equipped with retractable landing gear.  •	 Minimum sink speed—important when thermalling.  •	 Best glide speed—airspeed that results in the least  amount of altitude loss over a given distance, not  considering the effects of wind.  •	 Maximum aerotow or ground launch speed— maximum airspeed that the glider may safely be towed  without causing structural damage.  

# Altimeter  

The altimeter measures the static air pressure of the  surrounding air mass. A flexible plastic tube connects the  altimeters static pressure inlet to the static port holes located  on the side of the glider.  [Figure 4-13]  If set to the proper  local pressure, the altimeter needles and dial indicate heights  above mean sea level (MSL).  [Figures 4-14  and  4-17]  Glider  pilots must be fully aware of the ground elevations on  

![](images/ae9d1955ccd400b743a8c351ec8a1b770f53f184225626a3b0c1437d50617a56.jpg)  
Figure 4-13.  Static vents and altimeter plumbing.  

the flight route or area in order to make flight decisions  concerning soaring or landing options.  

# Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude  

Atmospheric pressure is caused by the weight of the column of  air above a given location. At sea level, the overlying column  of air exerts a force equivalent to 14.7 pounds per square  inch,   $1013.2\,\mathrm{mb}$  , or 29.92 inches of mercury. The higher the  altitude is, the shorter the overlying column of air is and the  lower the weight of that column is. Therefore, atmospheric  pressure decreases with altitude. At 18,000 feet, atmospheric  pressure is approximately half that at sea level.  [Figure 4-16]  

# Principles of Operation  

The pressure altimeter is simply an aneroid barometer that  measures the pressure of the atmosphere at the level at which  the altimeter is located and presents an altitude indication  in feet. The altimeter uses static pressure as its source of  operation. Air is denser at the surface of the earth than aloft;  as altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. This  difference in pressure at various levels causes the altimeter to  indicate changes in altitude.  Figures 4-15 and 4-17  illustrate  how the altimeter functions. The presentation of altitude  varies considerably between different types of altimeters.  Some have one pointer while others have more.  

The dial of a typical altimeter is graduated with numerals  arranged clockwise from 0 to 9 inclusive, as shown in  Figure 4-14 . Movement of the aneroid element is transmitted  through a gear train to the three hands, which sweep the  calibrated dial to indicate altitude. The shortest hand indicates  altitude in tens of thousands of feet; the intermediate hand in  thousands of feet; and the longest hand in hundreds of feet,  subdivided into 20-foot increments.

Figure 4-16.  Atmospheric pressure and altitude.  

The altitude indicated on the altimeter is correct only if the  sea level barometric pressure is standard   $(29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg})$  , the sea  level free air temperature is standard   ${+15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}}$   or  $59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ), and  the pressure and temperature decreases at a standard rate with  an increase in altitude. Since atmospheric pressure continually  changes, a means is provided to adjust the altimeter to  compensate for nonstandard conditions. This is accomplished  through a system by which the altimeter setting (local station  barometric pressure reduced to sea level) is set to a barometric  scale located on the face of the altimeter. Only after the  altimeter is set properly will it indicate the correct altitude.  

# Effect of Nonstandard Pressure and Temperature  

If no means were provided for adjusting altimeters to  nonstandard pressure, flight could be hazardous. For example,  if a flight is made from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure  area without adjusting the altimeter, the actual altitude of the  glider is lower than indicated altitude. When flying from a  low-pressure area to a high-pressure area, the actual altitude  

![](images/8fc13eb7e8d488517069b52dcf151f013c76eeded3a8182222e28e5b75f85b2a.jpg)  
Figure 4-17.  How the altimeter functions.  

of the glider is higher than the indicated altitude. Fortunately,  this error can be corrected by setting the altimeter properly.  When flying in the local area and communication with ATC  is not available to provide the current altimeter setting, there  is an alternative procedure. Set the altimeter on zero while  on the ground to directly read AGL referenced to the landing  zone. However, for cross-country flights and flights from  higher elevation airports, that procedure may not be an option  due to the excessive Kollsman window setting instrument  required. In those instances, the altimeter can be set to read  the field elevation and either disregard the Kollsman window  setting or applying a correction factor, or set in the barometric  altimeter setting and remember if it reads high or low.  

volume than on a cold day, and consequently the pressure  levels are raised. For example, the pressure level at which  the altimeter indicates 10,000 feet is higher on a warm day  than under standard conditions. On a cold day, the reverse  is true, and the 10,000-foot level would be lower. The  adjustment made by the pilot to compensate for nonstandard  pressures does not compensate for nonstandard temperatures.  Therefore, if terrain or obstacle clearance is a factor in the  selection of a cruising altitude, particularly at higher altitudes,  remember to anticipate that colder than standard temperature  places the glider lower than the altimeter indicates. Therefore,  a higher altitude should be used to provide adequate terrain  clearance. A memory aid in applying the above is “from a  high to a low or hot to cold, look out below.”  [Figure 4-18] Variations in air temperature also affect the altimeter. On  a warm day, the expanded air is lighter in weight per unit

Figure 4-18.  Nonstandard pressure and temperature.  

# Setting the Altimeter (Kollsman Window)  

To adjust the altimeter for variation in atmospheric pressure,  the pressure scale in the altimeter setting window (Kollsman  Window), calibrated in inches of mercury   $(^{\mathrm{"Hg}})$  , is adjusted  to correspond with the given altimeter setting. Altimeter  settings can be defined as station pressure reduced to sea  level, expressed in inches of mercury. Pilots should be aware  of three altimeter setting acronyms: QNH, QFE, and QNE.  The pilot sets QNH to read MSL, sets QFE to read the altitude  above ground level (AGL), and QNE when flying above the  transition level (18,000 feet in the United States). A glider  pilot would use this setting when wave flying and is above  18,000 feet or flight level 180 (FL180). To read QNH, pilots  should set the current altimeter setting into the altimeter’s  barometric setting window. The altimeter should read what  the approximate field elevation is, which is a good way to  check if it is working properly.  A good memory aid for this  step is to think of “H” (QNH) for home. QFE is set at zero  when on the field. As a memory aid, think of the F in QFE  as “field.” Many altimeters cannot be set to read zero when  operating from the higher elevation airports.  

The station reporting the altimeter setting takes an hourly  measurement of the station’s atmospheric pressure and  corrects this value to sea level pressure. These altimeter  settings reflect height above sea level only in the vicinity of  the reporting station. Aircraft flying above the transition level  (in the United States, FL180), must use the standard altimeter  setting of  $29.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}$   (QNE). When flying below 18,000 feet  MSL, it is necessary to adjust the altimeter setting as the  flight progresses from one station to the next.  

When flying over high mountainous terrain, certain  atmospheric conditions can cause the altimeter to indicate  an altitude of 1,000 feet, or more, higher than the actual  altitude. For this reason, a generous margin of altitude should  be allowed—not only for possible altimeter error, but also  for possible downdrafts that are particularly prevalent if high  winds are encountered.  

To illustrate the use of the altimeter setting system, follow  a cross-country flight from TSA Gliderport, Midlothian,  Texas, to Winston Airport, Snyder, Texas, via Stephens  County Airport, Breckenridge, Texas. Before takeoff from  TSA Gliderport, the pilot receives a current local altimeter  setting of 29.85 from the Fort Worth automated flight service  station (AFSS). This value is set in the altimeter setting  window of the altimeter. The altimeter indication should  then be compared with the known airport elevation of 660  feet. Since most altimeters are not perfectly calibrated, an  error may exist. VFR flights altimeters do not need to be  calibrated but if an altimeter indication differs from the field  elevation by more than 75 feet, the accuracy of the instrument  is questionable, and it should be referred to an instrument  repair station.  

When over Stephens County Airport, assume the pilot  receives a current area altimeter setting of 29.94 and applies  this setting to the altimeter. Before entering the traffic  pattern at Winston Airport, a new altimeter setting of 29.69  is received from the Automated Weather Observing System  (AWOS), and applied to the altimeter. If the pilot desires to  enter the traffic pattern at approximately 1,000 feet above  terrain, and the field elevation of Winston Airport is 2,430  feet, an indicated altitude of 3,400 feet should be used.  

2,430 feet $+~1{,}000$  feet $=3{,}430$  feet, rounded to 3,400 feet  

The importance of properly setting and reading the altimeter  cannot be overemphasized. Let us assume that the pilot  neglected to adjust the altimeter at Winston Airport to the  current setting, and uses the Stephens County area setting of  29.94. If this occurred, the glider would be approximately  250 feet below the airport downwind entry altitude of 3,200  feet when entering the Winston Airport traffic pattern, and  the altimeter would indicate approximately 250 feet higher  than the field elevation (2,430 feet) upon landing.  

This altitude error is another reason for a glider pilot to always  fly a safe visual approach angle to the landing zone and not  solely depend on instrument readings or past selection of turn  points for the traffic pattern. The visual angle to the landing  zone is the one item of information that will always be true.  Reports of wind and barometric pressure if available may  still be suspect. The glider pilot must always ensure sufficient  altitude is available for expected or possible winds to allow  landing in the landing zone.  

Actual altimeter setting  $=29.94\$  

Correct altimeter setting  $=29.69$  

Difference  $=.25$  

One inch of pressure is equal to approximately 1,000 feet  of altitude.  

$$
.25\times1{,}000\;\mathrm{feet}=250\;\mathrm{feet}
$$  

The previous calculation may be confusing, particularly in  determining whether to add or subtract the amount of altimeter  error. The following additional explanation is offered and  can be helpful in finding the solution to this type of problem.  

There are two means by which the altimeter pointers can be  moved. One utilizes changes in air pressure, while the other  utilizes the mechanical makeup of the altimeter setting system.  

When the glider altitude is changed, the changing pressure  within the altimeter case expands or contracts the aneroid  barometer that, through linkage, rotates the pointers. A decrease  in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate an increase in altitude,  and an increase in pressure causes the altimeter to indicate a  decrease in altitude. If the glider is flown from a pressure level  of   $28.75~"\mathrm{Hg}$   to a pressure level of   $29.75~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , the altimeter  would show a decrease of approximately 1,000 feet in altitude.  

The other method of moving the pointers does not rely on  changing air pressure, but on the mechanical construction  of the altimeter. When the knob on the altimeter is rotated,  the altimeter setting pressure scale moves simultaneously  with the altimeter pointers. This may be confusing because  the numerical values of pressure indicated in the window  increase while the altimeter indicates an increase in altitude,  and decrease while the altimeter indicates a decrease in  altitude. This is contrary to the reaction on the pointers when  air pressure changes and is based solely on the mechanical  makeup of the altimeter. To further explain this point, assume  that the correct altimeter setting is 29.50, or a .50 difference.  This would cause a 500 foot error in altitude. In this case,  if the altimeter setting is adjusted from 30.00 to 29.50, the  numerical value decreases and the altimeter indicates a  decrease of 500 feet in altitude. Before this correction was  made, the glider was actually flying at an altitude of 500  feet lower than was shown on the altimeter. It is important  to calibrate the altimeter for all VFR flights because if they  are off by more than a comfortable margin, calibration or  repair is advisable.  

# Types of Altitude  

Knowing the glider’s altitude is vitally important to the pilot  for several reasons. The pilot must be sure that the glider is  flying high enough to clear the highest terrain or obstruction  along the intended route. To keep above mountain peaks, the  pilot must be aware of the glider’s altitude and elevation of  the surrounding terrain at all times. Knowledge of the altitude  is necessary to calculate TAS.  

Altitude is vertical distance above some point or level used  as a reference. There may be as many kinds of altitude as  there are reference levels from which altitude is measured,  and each may be used for specific reasons.  

The following are the four types of altitude that affect glider  pilots.  [Figure 4-19]  

•	 Indicated altitude—altitude read directly from the  altimeter (uncorrected) after it is set to the current  altimeter setting (QNH) in the Kollsman window.  Indicated altitude can be used for maintaining terrain/ obstacle clearance and estimating distance to glide  over the terrain without benefit of lift.  

•	 True altitude—true vertical distance of the glider  above sea level (known as MSL). This altitude is  measured above a standard datum due to the shape  of the earth (often expressed in this manner: 10,900  feet MSL, 5,280 feet MSL, or 940 feet MSL). Airport,  terrain, and obstacle elevations found on aeronautical  charts are expressed as MSL (true altitudes). With

Figure 4-19.  Types of altitude.  

proper local altimeter setting (QHN), indicated and  true altitude are synonymous.  

•	 Absolute altitude—vertical distance above the terrain,  above ground level (AGL). An altimeter set to the  proper pressure reading (QFE setting) indicates zero  feet at touchdown. It is referred to as QFE. The  METAR weather report in the remarks section lists  this setting as sea level pressure (SLP) and is expressed  in millibars (mb). Absolute altitude is very important  when flying low and determining when an out landing  must be accomplished. An out landing is a glider  landing not at the intended airfield but required when  lift is insufficient to remain aloft.  

•	 Pressure altitude—altitude indicated at which the  altimeter setting window (barometric scale) is adjusted  to 29.92 is the standard datum plane, a theoretical  plane where air pressure (corrected to  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  )  is equal to   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Pressure altitude is used for  computer solutions to determine density altitude, true  altitude, TAS, etc.  

•	 Density altitude—pressure altitude corrected for  nonstandard temperature variations. Density altitude  is a yardstick by which we can reference the density of  air. The wings of the glider are affected by the density  of air because they use air molecules to generate lift.  Thinner air restricts fuel burn and lowers compression  in the engine thereby reducing the power output.  Thinner air necessitates an increased AOA to generate  the same amount of lift. High density altitudes decrease  towplane (and self-launching combustion powerplant)  power, so expect much longer takeoff runs during tows,  slower climbs, and the higher TAS results in longer  landing rollouts due to higher ground speeds.  

When conditions are standard, pressure altitude and density  altitude are the same. Consequently, if the temperature is above  standard, the density altitude is higher than pressure altitude.  If the temperature is below standard, the density altitude is  lower than pressure altitude. The density altitude determines  the gliders performance and greatly affects the performance of  towplanes and powerplants in self-launching gliders.  

# Variometer  

Variometer instruments measure the vertical ascent or descent  of the local air mass and glider combined and displays that  information as speed. The principles of operation are similar  to the altimeter. The variometer is viewed as a critical part of  the glider’s instrument display, giving the pilot information on  performance of the glider while flying through the atmosphere.  The variometer depends upon the pressure lapse rate in the  atmosphere to derive information about rate of climb or rate  of descent. A non-electric variometer uses a separate insulated  tank (thermos or capacity flask) as a reference chamber. The  tubing is plumbed from the reference chamber through the  variometer instrument to an outside static port.  [Figure 4-20]  

![](images/8715a5aa22514253898e461c83b523ad437d5bca1423b4dac8f19c070e99b7a2.jpg)  
Figure 4-20.  Uncompensated variometer plumbing.  

A variometer with tubing is connected to an outside static  port is uncompensated. The internal hairspring mechanism  determines sensitivity of the variometer. The variometer has  a very rapid response due to the small mass and lightweight  construction of the moving parts.  [Figure 4-21]  

Pressure differences between the air inside the variometer/ reference chamber system and the air outside of the system  tend to equalize as air flows from high pressure areas to low  pressure areas. When pressure inside the reference chamber is  greater than the pressure outside, air flows out of the reference  chamber through the mechanical variometer to the outside  environment. When air pressure outside the reference chamber  is greater than pressure inside, air flows through the variometer  and into the reference chamber until pressure is equalized. The  variometer needle indicates a vertical descending air mass or  sink which is falling air that forces the glider to lose height.  Figures 4-22  and  4-23  illustrate how the variometer works  in level flight and while the glider is ascending. In addition,  Figure 4-24  illustrates certain flight maneuvers that cause the  variometer to display changes in altitude.  

Electric-powered variometers offer several advantages over  the non-electric variety. These advantages include more  rapid response rates and separate audible signals for climb  and descent.  

Some electric variometers operate by the cooling effect of  airflow on an element called a thermistor, a heat-sensitive  electrical resistor. The electrical resistance of the thermistor  changes when temperature changes. As air flows into or out  of the reference chamber, it flows across two thermistors in  a bridge circuit. An electrical meter measures the imbalance  across the bridge circuit and calculates the rate of climb or  descent. It then displays the information on the variometer.  

Newer electric variometers operate on the transducer  principle. A tiny vacuum cavity on a circuit board is  sealed with a flexible membrane. Variable resistors are  embedded in the membrane. When pressure outside the  

![](images/082e58728903d5d1e48889a5dd8018687dbef27582a5a3c270d1c63dd1d27e92.jpg)

cavity changes, minute alterations in the shape of the  membrane occur. As a result, electrical resistance in the  embedded resistors changes. These changes in electrical  resistance are interpreted by a circuit board and indicated  on the variometer dial as climb or descent.  

Many electrical variometers provide audible tones, or beeps,  that indicate the rate of climb or rate of descent of the glider.  Audio variometers enhance safety of flight because they make  it unnecessary for the glider pilot to look at the variometer to  discern the rate of climb or rate of descent. Instead, the pilot  can hear the rate of climb or rate of descent. This allows the  pilot to minimize time spent looking at the flight instruments  and maximize time spent looking outside for other air traffic.  [Figure 4-25]  

Some variometers are equipped with a rotatable rim speed  scale called a MacCready ring. This scale indicates the  optimum airspeed to fly when traveling between thermals  for maximum cross-country performance. During the glide  between thermals, the index arrow is set at the rate of  climb expected in the next thermal. On the speed ring, the  

![](images/a65f33095175a1588286fdd2d7ab8cf98729f02d57c0871a3ee8b7f9454b091e.jpg)  
Figure 4-25.  When an electric variometer is mounted to the glider,  a non-electric variometer is usually installed as a backup.  

variometer needle points to the optimum speed to fly (STF)  between thermals. If expected rate of climb is low, optimum  interthermal cruise airspeed is relatively low. When expected  lift is strong, however, optimum interthermal cruise airspeed  is much faster.  [Figure 4-26]  A MacCready ring has single  pilot values in front and dual pilot values for the second seat  instrument. Marked for specific aircraft, some may have  empty ballast and full ballast values.

Figure 4-26.  The MacCready ring.  

Variometers are sensitive to changes in pressure altitude  caused by airspeed. In still air, when the glider dives,  the variometer indicates a descent. When the glider pulls  out of the dive and begins a rapid climb, the variometer  indicates an ascent. This indication is sometimes called a  stick thermal. A glider lacking a compensated variometer  must be flown at a constant airspeed to receive an accurate  variometer indication.  

# Total Energy System  

A variometer with a total energy system senses changes in  airspeed and tends to cancel out the resulting climb and dive  indications (stick thermals). This is desirable because the  glider pilot wants to know how rapidly the air mass is rising  or descending despite changes in airspeed.  

A popular type of total energy system consists of a small  venturi mounted in the air stream and connected to the static  outlet of the variometer or simply as a slot or pair of holes on  the back side of a quarter inch vertical tube. When airspeed  increases, more suction from the venturi moderates (offsets)  the pressure at the static outlet of the variometer. Similarly,  when airspeed decreases, reduced suction from the venturi  moderates (offsets) the pressure at the static outlet of the  variometer. If the venturi is properly designed and installed,  the net effect is to reduce climb and dive indications caused  by airspeed changes. To maximize the precision of this  compensation effect, the total energy probe needs to be in  undisturbed airflow ahead of the aircraft nose or tail fin (the  "Braunschweig tube", the long cantilevered tube with a kink  in the end that can be seen projecting from the leading edge  of the tail fin on most modern sailplanes.)  [Figure 4-27]  

Another type of total energy system is designed with a  diaphragm-type compensator placed in line from the pitot tube  to the line coming from the reference chamber (thermos or  capacity flask). Deflection of the diaphragm is proportional to  the effect the airspeed change has on pitot pressure. In effect,  the diaphragm modulates pressure changes in the capacity  flask. When properly adjusted, the diaphragm compensator  does an adequate job of masking stick thermals.  [Figure 4-28]  

# Netto  

A variometer that indicates the vertical movement of the air  mass, regardless of the glider’s climb or descent rate, is called  a Netto variometer system. Some Netto variometer systems  employ a calibrated capillary tube that functions as a tiny  

![](images/10bc3cd89cce9b740ea40e743af22409820d464381f44b106dacd8da304c1dae.jpg)

valve. Pitot pressure pushes minute quantities of air through  the valve and into the reference chamber tubing. The effect  is to remove the glider’s sink rate at various airspeeds from  the variometer indication (polar sink rate).  [Figure 4-28]  

Computerized (electronic) Netto variometers employ a  different method to remove the glider performance polar  sink rate from the variometer indication. In this type of  system, sensors for both pitot pressure and static pressure  provide airspeed information to the computer. The sink  rate of the glider at every airspeed is stored in the computer  memory. At any given airspeed, the sink rate of the glider  is mathematically removed, and the variometer displays the  rate of ascent or descent of the air mass itself.  

# Electronic Flight Computers  

Electronic flight computers are found in the cockpits of  gliders that are flown in competition and cross-country  soaring. Since nonpowered gliders lack a generator or  alternator, electrical components, such as the flight computer  and very high frequency (VHF) transceiver, draw power from  the glider battery or batteries. The battery is usually a 12- or  14-volt sealed battery. Solar cells are sometimes arrayed  behind the pilot, or on top of the instrument panel cover, to  supply additional power to the electrical system during flight  in sunny conditions.  

The primary components of most flight computer systems  are an electric variometer, a coupled GPS receiver, and a  microprocessor. The variometer measures rate of climb  and descent. The GPS provides position information. The  microprocessor interprets altitude, speed, and position  information. The microprocessor output aids the pilot in  cross-country decision-making. Shown in  Figure 4-29  is a  high end glider flight computer.  

![](images/c8673ec4fa489d81996edec74575e1eeac3522a52be2ce38198b45bc3583f9b3.jpg)  
Figure 4-29.  High end flight computer system.  

The GPS-coupled flight computer can provide the following  information:  

•	 Where you are •	 Where you have been •	 Distance to planned destination •	 How fast you are going there •	 How high you need to be to glide there •	 How fast you are climbing or descending •	 The optimum airspeed to fly to the next area of  anticipated lift •	 The optimum airspeed to fly to a location on the  ground, such as the finish line in a race or the airport  of intended landing at the end of a cross-country flight  

The primary benefits of the flight computer can easily be  divided into two areas: navigation assistance and performance  (speed) enhancement.  

Fundamental to the use of the flight computer is the concept  of waypoint. A waypoint is simply a point in space. The three  coordinates of the point are latitude, longitude, and altitude.  Glider races and cross-country glider flights frequently  involve flight around a series of waypoints called turnpoints.  The course may be an out-and-return course, a triangle, a  quadrilateral or other type of polygon, or a series of waypoints  laid out more or less in a straight line. The glider pilot must  navigate from point to point, using available lift sources to  climb periodically so that flight can continue to the intended  goal. The GPS-enabled flight computer aids in navigation  and in summarizing how the flight is going. When strong lift  is encountered, and if the pilot believes it is likely that the  strong lift source may be worth returning to after rounding  a turnpoint, the flight computer can mark the location of the  thermal. Then, the glider pilot can round a nearby turnpoint  and use the flight computer to guide the return to the marked  thermal in the hopes of making a rapid climb and heading  out on course toward the next turnpoint.  

During the climb portion of the flight, the flight computer’s  variometer constantly updates the achieved rate of climb.  During cruise, the GPS-coupled flight computer aids in  navigating accurately to the next turnpoint. The flight  computer also suggests the optimum cruise airspeed for the  glider to fly, based on the expected rate of climb in the next  thermal.  During final glide to a goal, the flight computer can  display glider altitude, altitude required to reach the goal,  distance to the goal, the strength of the headwind or tailwind  component, and optimum airspeed to fly.  

Most flight computers incorporate an electronic audiovisual  variometer. The rate of climb or descent can be viewed  on the computer’s visual display. The variometer also  provides audible rate of climb information through a small  loudspeaker. The loudspeaker allows the pilot to hear how  fast the glider is climbing or descending. Because this  information is received through hearing, the pilot’s vision can  be constantly directed outside the glider to enhance safety of  flight and cross-country performance.  

Flight computers also provide information to help the pilot  select and fly the optimum airspeed for the weather conditions  being encountered. When lift is strong and climbs are fast,  higher airspeeds around the course are possible. The flight  computer detects the rapid climbs and suggests very high  cruise airspeeds to enhance performance. When lift is weak  and climbs are slow, optimum airspeed is significantly lower  than when conditions are strong. The flight computer, sensing  the relatively low rate of climb on a difficult day, compensates  for the weaker conditions, and suggests optimum airspeeds  that are lower than they would be if conditions were strong.  The flight computer relieves the pilot of the chore of making  numerous speed-to-fly calculations during cross-country  flight. This freedom allows the pilot to look for other air  traffic, look for sources of lift, watch the weather ahead, and  plot a strategy for the remaining portion of the flight.  

The presence of water ballast alters the performance  characteristics of the glider. In racing, the ability to make  faster glides without excess altitude penalty is very valuable.  The additional weight of water in the glider’s ballast tanks  allows flatter glides at high airspeeds. The water ballast glider  possesses the strongest advantage when lift conditions are  strong and rapid climbs are achievable. The flight computer  compensates for the amount of water ballast carried, adjusting  speed-to-fly computations according to the weight and  performance of the glider. Some flight computers require  the pilot to enter data regarding the ballast condition of the  glider. Other flight computers automatically compensate  for the effect of water ballast by constantly measuring the  performance of the glider and deducting the operating weight  of the glider from these measurements. If the wings of the  glider become contaminated with bugs, glider performance  declines. The glide computer can be adjusted to account for  the resulting performance degradation.  

# Magnetic Compass  

Some gliders do not have compass deviation cards because  they are not required instrumentation per the Type Certificate  Data Sheets (TCDS). Most gliders are not considered  powered aircraft as referenced in Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.205, and  are only subject to regulations specifying “civil aircraft.”  Two examples that show these are 14 CFR part 91, section  91.209 and 91.211.  

# Yaw String  

The most effective, yet least expensive, slip/skid indicator is  made from a piece of yarn mounted in the free airstream in  a place easily visible to the pilot, as shown in  Figure 4-30 .  The yaw string indicates whether the pilot is using the rudder  and aileron inputs together in a coordinated fashion. When  the controls are properly coordinated, the yarn points straight  back, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the glider. During  a slipping turn, the tail of the yaw string is offset toward the  outside of the turn. In flight, the rule to remember is simple:  step on the head of the yaw string. If the head of the yaw  string is to the right of the tail, then the pilot needs to apply  right pedal. If the head of the yaw string is to the left of the  tail, then the pilot should apply left pedal.  

# Inclinometer  

Another type of slip/skid indicator is the inclinometer. Like  the magnetic compass, this instrument requires no electrical  power or input from other aircraft systems. The inclinometer  is influenced by centrifugal force and gravity. Mounted in the  bottom of a turn-and-bank indicator or mounted separately  in the instrument panel, the inclinometer consists of a metal  ball in an oil-filled, curved glass tube. When the glider is  flying in coordinated fashion, the ball remains centered at  the bottom of the glass tube. The inclinometer differs from  the yaw string during uncoordinated flight. The ball moves  to the inside of the turn to indicate a slip and to the outside  of the turn to indicate a skid. Remember the phrase, “step on  the ball” in reference to the inclinometer; it helps coordinate  the turn using rudder inputs. The long glider wing tends  to increase the adverse yaw effects from the ailerons and  requires more rudder control than many aircraft.

Figure 4-30.  Left turn condition indications of a yaw string and  inclinometer.  

# Gyroscopic Instruments  

Gyroscopic instruments are found in virtually all modern  airplanes but are infrequently found in gliders. Self-launching  gliders often have one or more gyroscopic instruments on  the panel. Gliders without power rarely have gyroscopic  instruments installed. The three gyroscopic instruments found  most frequently in a glider are the heading indicator, attitude  indicator, and turn coordinator.  

# G-Meter  

Another instrument that can be mounted in the instrument  panel of a glider is a G-meter. G-meters register positive G  forces from climbs and turns, as well as negative G forces  when diving down or pushing over from a climb. The G-meter  measures and displays the load imposed on the glider during  flight. During straight, unaccelerated flight in calm air, a  glider experiences a load factor of 1 G (1.0 times the force  of gravity). During aerobatics or during flight in turbulent  air, the glider and pilot experience G-loads greater than 1 G.  These additional loads result from accelerations imposed on  the glider. Some of these accelerations result from external  sources, such as flying into updrafts or downdrafts. Other  accelerations arise from pilot input on the controls, such as  pulling back or pushing forward on the control stick. G-loads  are classified as positive or negative.  

Positive G is felt when increasing pitch rapidly for a climb.  Negative G is felt when pushing over into a dive or during  sustained inverted flight. Each glider type is designed to  withstand a specified maximum positive G-load and a  specified maximum negative G-load. The GFM/POH is  the definitive source for this information. Exceeding the  allowable limit loads may result in deformation of the glider  structure. In extreme cases, exceeding permissible limit loads  may cause structural failure of the glider. The G-meter allows  the pilot to monitor G-loads from moment to moment. This  is useful in aerobatic flight and during flight in rough air.  Most G-meters also record and display the maximum positive  G-load and the maximum negative G-load encountered  during flight. The recorded maximum positive and negative  G-loads can be reset by adjusting the control knob of the  G-meter.  [Figure 4-31]

# FLARM Collision Avoidance System  

Mid-air collisions are a long standing danger in aviation  and glider pilots have additional mid-air threats due to  thermalling, cloud-street flying, and ridge running. All of  these can put the glider in close proximity to other gliders  and other aircraft. No matter how vigilant pilots are, too many  stories of "near misses” exist. There are mid-air collisions or  near misses each year in both club flying and in competition  and between gliders and towplanes.  

As a way to mitigate mid-air collisions, the FLARM collision  avoidance system was developed for glider pilots by glider  pilots. FLARM warns FLARM-equipped pilots of impending  collisions and gives the location of non-threatening nearby  FLARM-equipped gliders.  Figure 4-32  shows the interior  of an ASW 19 glider with a FLARM unit on top of the  instrument panel. It only works if both gliders have FLARMs.  FLARM knows about the unique flight characteristics of  gliders and stays quiet unless there is a real hazard.  

![](images/ea5b2cf8a5a8095b4955421f8d42abe2d55db6d711bb173387f674f8da12af16.jpg)  
Figure 4-32.  FLARM unit on top of the instrument panel.  

FLARM (the name being inspired from 'flight alarm') obtains  its position from an internal global positioning system (GPS)  and a barometric sensor and then broadcasts this with forecast  data about the future 3D flight track. Its receiver listens  for other FLARM devices within typically 3-5 kilometers  and processes the information received. Motion-prediction  algorithms predict potential conflicts for up to 50 other signals  and warn the pilot using sound and visual means. FLARM  can also store information about static aerial obstacles, such  as cables, into a database.  

frequently close to each other without being in danger of  collision. ACAS would provide continuous and unnecessary  warnings about all aircraft in the vicinity, whereas FLARM  only gives selective alerts to aircraft posing a collision risk.  Versions are sold for use in light aircraft and helicopters, as  well as gliders. However, the short range of the signal makes  FLARM unsuitable for avoiding collisions with fast moving  aircraft, such as commercial and military jets.  

# Outside Air Temperature Gauge  

The outside air temperature gauge (OAT) is a simple and  effective self-contained device mounted so that the sensing  element is exposed to the outside air. The sensing element  consists of a bimetallic-type thermometer in which two  dissimilar metals are welded together into a single strip and  twisted into a helix. One end is anchored into a protective tube,  and the other end is affixed to the pointer that reads against the  calibration on a circular face. OAT gauges are calibrated in  degrees Celsius, degrees Fahrenheit, or both. An accurate air  temperature provides the glider pilot with useful information  about temperature lapse rate with altitude change. A very fast  reading OAT gauge can give glider pilots another indication  of the hottest center portion of thermals for maximum loft and  where the edge of the lifting currents are located.  

When flying a glider loaded with water ballast, knowledge  of the height of the freezing level is important to safety of  flight. Extended operation of a glider loaded with water  ballast in below-freezing temperatures may result in frozen  drain valves, ruptured ballast tanks, and structural damage  to the glider.  [Figure 4-33]  

![](images/389aaa58e5cc0bf4fa4ea7c43ca2cc90390ad294f5c336d5024f5b462c226257.jpg)  
Figure 4-33.  Outside air temperature (OAT) gauge.  

Unlike conventional transponders in aircraft, FLARM has a  low-power consumption and is relatively inexpensive to buy  and to install. Furthermore, conventional Airborne Collision  Avoidance Systems (ACAS) are of little use in preventing  gliders from colliding with each other because gliders are  Chapter 5  

# Glider Performance  

# Introduction  

Glider performance during launch phase, landing, and free  flight phase depends on many factors: design, weather, wind,  and other atmospheric phenomena.  

#  

#  

# Factors Affecting Performance  

Glider performance during launch depends on the power  output of the launch mechanism and on the aerodynamic  efficiency of the glider itself. The four major factors that affect  performance are density altitude, weight, design, and wind.  

# High and Low Density Altitude Conditions  

Every pilot must understand the terms “high density altitude”  and “low density altitude.” In general, high density altitude  refers to thin air, while low density altitude refers to dense  air. Those conditions that result in a high density altitude  (thin air) are high elevations, low atmospheric pressure,  high temperatures, high humidity, or some combination  thereof. Lower elevations, high atmospheric pressure, low  temperatures, and low humidity are more indicative of low  density altitude (dense air). However, high density altitudes  may be present at lower elevations on hot days, so it is  important to calculate the density altitude and determine  performance before a flight.  

One way to determine density altitude is to use charts  designed for that purpose.  [Figure 5-1]  For example, you  plan to depart an airport where the field elevation is 1,600 feet  MSL. If the altimeter setting is 29.80, and the temperature  is   $85\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , what is the density altitude? First, correct for  nonstandard pressure   $(29.8\:"\mathrm{Hg})$   by referring to the right side  of the chart and adding 112 feet to the field elevation. The  result is a pressure altitude of 1,712 feet. Then, enter the chart  at the bottom, just above the temperature of   $85~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $29.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  .  Proceed up the chart vertically until intercepting the diagonal  1,712-foot pressure altitude line, then move horizontally to  the left and read the density altitude of approximately 3,500  feet. This means a self-launching glider or towplane will  perform as if it were at 3,500 feet MSL on a standard day.  

Most performance charts do not require a pilot to compute  density altitude. Instead, the computation is built into the  performance chart itself. A pilot needs only the correct  pressure altitude and the temperature. Some charts, however,  may require computing density altitude before entering them.  Density altitude may be computed using a density altitude  chart or by using a flight computer.  

# Atmospheric Pressure  

Due to changing weather conditions, atmospheric pressure  at a given location changes from day to day. The following  is the METAR report for Love Field observed on the 23rd  at 21:53Z (GMT) which indicates a local pressure of A2953,  or altimeter setting of  $29.53\:"\mathrm{Hg}$  . When barometric pressure  drops, air density decreases. The reduced density of the air  results in an increase in density altitude and decreased glider  performance. This reduces takeoff and climb performance  and increases the length of runway needed for landing.

The 12/11 notation of this report indicates the reported  temperature and dewpoint for Love Field.  

When barometric pressure rises, air density increases. The  greater density of the air results in lower density altitude.  Thus, takeoff and climb performance improves, and the  length of runway needed for landing decreases.  

# Altitude  

As altitude increases, air density decreases. At altitude, the  atmospheric pressure that acts on a given volume of air is  less, allowing the air molecules to space themselves further  apart. The result is that a given volume of air at high altitude  contains fewer air molecules than the same volume of air at  lower altitude. As altitude increases, density altitude increases,  and glider takeoff and climb performance is reduced.  

# Temperature  

Temperature changes have a large effect on density altitude.  When air is heated, it expands—the molecules move  farther apart, making the air less dense. Takeoff and climb  performance is reduced, while the length of runway required  for landing is increased.  

Consider the following METAR for two airports with  same altimeter setting, temperature, and dewpoint. Love  Field (KDAL) airport elevation of 487 feet versus Denver  International (KDEN) at 5,431 feet.  

KDAL 240453Z 21007KT 10SM CLR 25/15 A3010 RMK  AO2…  

KDEN 240453Z 24006KT 10SM FEW120 SCT200 25/15  A3010 RMK AO2…  

The computed density altitude for Love Field is 1,774 feet;  for Denver, 7,837 feet—almost twice the density altitude  increase compared to the increase for Love Field. The effects  of attitude and temperature are significant, a fact pilots must  consider when computing aircraft performance.  

# Wind  

Wind affects glider performance in many ways. Headwind  during launch results in shorter ground roll, while tailwind causes  longer ground roll before takeoff.  [Figure 5-2]  Crosswinds  during launch require proper crosswind procedures or control  input to track along the runway.  

During cruising flight, headwinds reduce the groundspeed  of the glider. A glider flying at 60 knots true airspeed into a  headwind of 25 knots has a groundspeed of only 35 knots.  Tailwinds, on the other hand, increase the groundspeed of  the glider. A glider flying at 60 knots true airspeed with a  tailwind of 25 knots has a groundspeed of 85 knots.  

Crosswinds during cruising flight cause glider heading (the  direction in which the glider nose is pointed) and glider  track (the path of the glider over the ground) to diverge. In  a glider, it must be remembered that crosswinds have some  head or tailwind component that results in a lower or higher  true groundspeed. When planning the landing, the wind  effects must be factored into the landing pattern sight picture  

![](images/69567064ce097358524daa030a1eea55f9504c3f427efe558a49b887e53ed3ca.jpg)  
Figure 5-2.  Apparent wind effect on takeoff distance and climb-out  angle.  

and allowances must be made for the winds, indicated or  expected. It is a lot easier to lose altitude than it is to make up  altitude when the glider is down low. When gliding toward an  object on the ground in the presence of crosswind, such as on  final glide at the end of a cross-country flight, the glider pilot  should keep the nose of the glider pointed somewhat upwind  of the target on the ground. For instance, if the crosswind  is from the right during final glide, the nose of the glider is  pointed a bit to the right of the target on the ground. The  glider’s heading is upwind (to the right, in this case) of the  target, but if the angle of crab is correct, the glider’s track is  straight toward the target on the ground.  [Figure 5-3]  

Headwind during landing results in a shortened ground  roll, and tailwind results in a longer ground roll. Crosswind  landings require the pilot to compensate for drift with the  proper flight control input, such as a sideslip or a crab. Glider  pilots must be aware of the apparent angle versus the rate of  descent. The glider descends at a constant rate, but the different  groundspeeds will result in different approach angles. These  different approach angles require specific techniques to ensure  safe touchdowns in the landing zone. For example, if landing  in a strong headwind, the glider pilot should plan for a closer  base leg to allow for the apparent steeper approach due to the  slower ground speed. Another technique would be the delayed  extension of spoilers or drag brakes and accepting the faster  airspeed to counter the headwind component. In the case of a  tailwind and an apparent lower angle of approach, the glider  pilot can use more spoiler or drag brake extension or slipping  or a combination as allowed by the GFM to touchdown in the  landing zone. In any condition, the glider pilot must make  allowances for the current conditions of wind and density  altitude to ensure a safe landing in the landing area. A glider  pilot must respond to the current conditions and amend the  traffic pattern and/or modify their procedures to compensate  

![](images/9e57d7ca4976c707de647d72a23d2894090f343714648dac7688fe566542141b.jpg)  
Figure 5-3.  Crosswind effect on final glide.  

for the conditions and land safely.  The different groundspeeds  also result in different touchdown points unless the pilot takes  some kind of action. In any case, the pilot should aim for the  touchdown zone markers and not for the end of the runway.  [Figure 5-4]  

During landing in windy/gusty conditions, there is a tendency  to lose airspeed (flying speed) and increase sink. The friction  between the ground and the air mass reduces the wind  strength. The glider may be flying into a strong headwind at  one moment; a few seconds later, the windspeed diminishes  to nearly zero. The pilot landing into a headwind can usually  expect to lose some of that headwind while approaching the  surface due to surface friction slowing the wind. When the  change is abrupt, the pilot experiences a loss of airspeed  because it requires some small time and loss of altitude to  accelerate the inertia of the glider up to the airspeed previously  displayed when into the stronger headwind. This takes on the  appearance of having to dive at the ground to maintain flying  speed. Fly a faster approach to ensure staying above stalling  speed. Depending on the wind change, a longer ground roll  may be the result. If this occurs near the ground, the glider  loses speed, and there may be insufficient altitude to recover  the lost speed. This is called “wind gradient.” Consideration  

![](images/e9bcb0b4320d8815cdfc51a490725d5a1100acb0cafdc58690a71b4dee3854a3.jpg)  
Figure 5-4.  Wind effect on final approach and landing distance.  

of wind gradient during a ground launch is important, as a  sudden increase in windspeed could result in exceeding the  designed launch speed.  [Figure 5-5]  

The pilot landing with a tail wind has a higher groundspeed  for an indicated airspeed. As the surface friction slows the  winds, the pilot may see an increase in airspeed before the  higher inertia-induced airspeed is dissipated, which may  increase the ground roll distance to touchdown. This may be  experienced with a downdraft in the vicinity of obstructions  upwind of the runway as the winds curl down and wrap under  the obstructions. This effect can lead to major undershoots of  the approach path and landing short if the winds are strong  enough. Local pilots can be a rich source of information about  local wind currents and hazards.  

Glider pilots must understand that wind near the ground  behaves differently higher up. Atmospheric conditions,  such as thermal formation, turbulence, and gust and lulls,  change the in-flight behavior of the glider significantly. As  the wind flows over the ground, ground obstructions, such  as buildings, trees, hills, and irregular formations along the  ground, interfere with the flow of the wind, decreasing its  velocity and breaking up its smooth flow as occurs in wave  and ridge flying.  

Wind gradient affects a pilot turning too steeply on final  approach at a very low airspeed and at low altitudes near to  the surface. There is less wind across the lower wing than  across the higher wing. The rolling force created by the wind  gradient affects the entire wing area. This can prevent the  pilot from controlling the bank with the ailerons and may  roll the glider past a vertical bank.  [Figure 5-6]   Be cautious  with any bank angle and at any airspeed while close to the  ground when transitioning a wind gradient.  

When approaching to land during windy and gusty conditions,  add half of the wind velocity to the approach speed to ensure  adequate speed for a possible encounter with a wind gradient.  During landing under these conditions, it is acceptable to allow  the glider to touch down a little faster than normal instead  of holding the glider off the ground for a low kinetic energy  landing. Upon touchdown during these landings, extending  the air brakes fully prevents the glider from becoming airborne  through a wind gust during the landing roll.  

Some self-launching gliders are designed for extended periods  of powered cruising flight. For these self-launching gliders,  maximum range (distance) for powered flight and maximum  duration (elapsed time aloft) for powered flight are primarily  limited by the self-launching glider’s fuel capacity. Wind has  no effect on flight duration but does have a significant effect  on range. During powered cruising flight, a headwind reduces  range, and a tailwind increases range. The Glider Flight  Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook (GFM/POH) provides  recommended airspeeds and power settings to maximize range  when flying in no-wind, headwind, or tailwind conditions.  

# Weight  

Glider lift, drag, and glide ratio characteristics are governed  solely by its design and construction, and are predetermined  at takeoff. The only characteristic the pilot controls is the  weight of the glider. In some cases, pilots may control glider  configurations, as some high-performance gliders may have  a wing extension option not available on other models.  Increased weight decreases takeoff and climb performance,  but increases high-speed cruise performance. During launch,  a heavy glider takes longer to accelerate to flying speed.  The heavy glider has more inertia, making it more difficult  to accelerate the mass of the glider to flying speed. After  takeoff, the heavier glider takes longer to climb out because

Figure 5-6.  Effect of wind velocity gradient on a glider turning into  the wind. Stronger airflow over higher wing causes bank to steepen  when close to the surface where surface friction slows winds.  

the heavier glider has more mass to lift to altitude than does  the lighter glider (whether ground launch, aerotow launch,  or self-launch).  [Figure 5-7]  

![](images/0d6d2a505801deab86140cd38bf2790e1fb9bd0dd6c9891fd164f0cde7f54b1d.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.  Effect of weight on takeoff distance and climb-out rate  and angle.  

The heavy glider has a higher stall speed and a higher  minimum controllable airspeed than an otherwise identical,  but lighter, glider. The stall speed of a glider increases with  the square root of the increase in weight. If the weight of  the glider is doubled (multiplied by 2.0), then the stall speed  increases by more than 40 percent (1.41 is the approximate  square root of 2; 1.41 times the old stall speed results in  the new stall speed at the heavier weight). For example, a  540-pound glider has a stalling speed of 40 knots. The pilot  adds 300 pounds of water ballast making the new weight 840  pounds. The new stalling speed is approximately 57 knots  (square root of  $\sqrt{300+40=57})$  ).  

When circling in thermals to climb, the heavy glider is at a  disadvantage relative to the light glider. The increased weight  of the heavy glider means stall airspeed and minimum sink  airspeed are greater than they would be if the glider were  operating at a light weight. At any given bank angle, the  heavy glider’s higher airspeeds mean the pilot must fly larger  diameter thermalling circles than the pilot of the light glider.  Since the best lift in thermals is often found in a narrow  cylinder near the core of the thermal, larger diameter circles  generally mean the heavy glider is unable to exploit the strong  lift of the thermal core, as well as the slower, lightweight  glider. This results in the heavy glider’s inability to climb as  fast in a thermal as the light glider.  [Figure 5-8]  

The heavy glider can fly faster than the light glider while  maintaining the same glide ratio as the light glider. The  advantage of the heavier weight becomes apparent during  cruising flight. The heavy glider can fly faster than the light  glider and still retain the same lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio.  

![](images/73492c902a686244bea9e461aaf262f2ff47c6d5b9e2004f4778e81d2a7cc561.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.  Effect of added weight on thermaling turn radius.  

If the operating weight of a given glider is increased, the  stall airspeed, minimum controllable airspeed, minimum  sink airspeed, and the best L/D airspeed are increased by  a factor equal to the square root of the increase in weight.  [Figure 5-9]  Glide ratio is not affected by weight because,  while a heavier glider sinks faster, it does so at a greater  airspeed. The glider descends faster, but covers the same  horizontal distance (at a higher speed) as a lighter glider with  the same glide ratio and starting altitude.  

![](images/400b3c7d7e1c020c2bc8a9cd6784fd83a69d81c53f0322f699de641b2ef64f48.jpg)  

To help gliders fly faster, some gliders have tanks that can  hold up to 80 gallons of water. Higher speeds are desirable for  cross-country flying and racing. The disadvantages of these  ballasted gliders include reduced climb rates in thermals and  the possibility that suitable lift cannot be located after tow  release. To prevent this, the water ballast can be jettisoned at  any time through dump valves, allowing the pilot to reduce  the weight of the glider to aid in increased climb rates.  

The addition of ballast to increase weight allows the glider  to fly at increased airspeeds while maintaining its L/D ratio.  Figure 5-9  shows that adding 400 pounds of water ballast  increases the best L/D airspeed from 60 knots to 73 knots.  The heavy glider has more difficulty climbing in thermals  than the light glider, but if lift is strong enough for the heavy  glider to climb reasonably well, the heavy glider’s advantage  during the cruising portion of flight outweighs the heavy  glider’s disadvantage during climbs.  

Water is often used as ballast to increase the weight of the  glider. However, the increased weight requires a higher  airspeed during the approach and a longer landing roll. Once  the cross-country phase is completed, the water ballast serves  no further purpose. The pilot should jettison the water ballast  prior to entering the traffic pattern. Reducing the weight of  the glider prior to landing allows the pilot to make a normal  approach and landing. The lighter landing weight also reduces  the loads that the landing gear of the glider must support.  

With the glide ratio data available to the pilot, provided by  the charts/graphs located in the GFM/POH for the glider,  the pilot can review or plot any specific combination of  airspeed and glide ratio/lift to drag ratio (L/D). The resulting  plot of L/D with airspeed (angle of attack) shows that glide  ratio increases to some maximum at the lowest airspeed.  Maximum lift-to-drag ratio   $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$  /glide ratio, occurs at  one specific airspeed (angle of attack and lift coefficient). If  the glider is operated in a steady flight condition, total drag is  at a minimum. This is solely based on airspeed. Any airspeed  (angle of attack lower or higher) than that for   $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}/}$  glide ratio reduces the  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}/}$  glide ratio and consequently  increases the total drag for a given glider’s lift.  

Note that a change in gross weight would require a change in  airspeed to support the new weight at the same lift coefficient  and angle of attack. This is why the glider GFM/POH has  different speeds for flying with or without ballast. The  configuration of a glider during flight has a great effect on  the L/D. One of the most important of which is the glider’s  best L/D/glide ratio.  

# Rate of Climb  

Rate of climb for the ground-launched glider primarily  depends on the strength of the ground-launching equipment.  When ground launching, rates of climb generally are quite  rapid, and can exceed 2,000 feet per minute (fpm) if the  winch or tow vehicle is very powerful. When aerotowing,  rate of climb is determined by the power of the towplane.  It is important when selecting a towplane to ensure that it  is capable of towing the glider, considering the existing  conditions and glider weight.  

Self-launching glider rate of climb is determined by design,  powerplant output, and glider weight. The rate of climb of  self-launching gliders may vary from as low as 200 fpm  to as much as 800 fpm or more in others. The pilot should  consult the GFM/POH to determine rate of climb under the  existing conditions.  

# Flight Manuals and Placards  

The GFM/POH provides the pilot with the necessary  performance information to operate the glider safely. A GFM/ POH may include the following information:  

•	 Description of glider primary components •	 Glider assembly •	 Weight and balance data •	 Description of glider systems •	 Glider performance •	 Operating limitations  

# Placards  

Cockpit placards provide the pilot with readily available  information that is essential for the safe operation of the  glider. All required placards are located in the GFM/POH.  

The amount of information that placards must convey to  the pilot increases as the complexity of the glider increases.  High performance gliders may be equipped with wing flaps,  retractable landing gear, a water ballast system, drogue chute  for use in the landing approach, and other features that are  intended to enhance performance. These gliders may require  additional placards.  [Figure 5-10]  

# Performance Information  

The GFM/POH is the source provided by the manufacturer  for glider performance information. In the GFM/POH, glider  performance is presented in terms of specific airspeed, such  as stall speed, minimum sinking airspeed, best L/D airspeed,  maneuvering speed, rough air speed, and the never exceed  speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$  . Some performance airspeeds apply only to  particular types of gliders. Gliders with wing flaps, for instance,  have a maximum permitted flaps extended airspeed   $(\mathrm{V_{FE}})$  .  

Manuals for self-launching gliders include performance  information about powered operations. These include rate of  climb, engine and propeller limitations, fuel consumption,  endurance, and cruise.  

# Glider Polars  

In addition, the manufacturer provides information about the  rate of sink in terms of airspeed, which is summarized in a  graph called a polar curve, or simply a polar.  [Figures 5-11]  

The vertical axis of the polar shows the sink rate in knots  (increasing sink downwards), while the horizontal axis shows  airspeed in knots. Every type of glider has a characteristic  polar derived either from theoretical calculations by the  designer or by actual in-flight measurement of the sink rate  at different speeds. The polar of each individual glider varies  (even from other gliders of the same type) by a few percent  depending on relative smoothness of the wing surface, the  amount of sealing around control surfaces, and even the  number of bugs on the wing’s leading edge. The polar forms  the basis for speed to fly and final glide tools that will be  discussed in Chapter 11, Cross-Country Soaring.  

Minimum sink rate is determined from the polar by extending  a horizontal line from the top of the polar to the vertical axis.  [Figure 5-12]  In this example, a minimum sink of 1.9 knots  occurs at 40 knots. Note that the sink rate increases between  minimum sink speed and the stall speed (the left end point of  the polar). The best glide speed (best L/D) is found by drawing  a tangent to the polar from the origin. The best L/D speed is  50 knots with a sink speed of 2.1 knots. The glide ratio at best

Figure 5-12.  Minimum sink airspeed and maximum L/D speed.  

L/D speed is determined by dividing the best L/D speed by  { the sink rate at that speed, or 50/2.1, which is approximately  24. Thus, this glider has a best glide ratio in calm air (no lift  or sink and no headwind or tailwind) of 24:1 at 50 knots.  

The best speed to fly for distance in a headwind is easily  Sink rate (knots) determined from the polar. To do this, shift the origin to the  7 right along the horizontal axis by the speed of the headwind  8 7 and draw a new tangent line to the polar.  

From the new tangent point, read the best speed to fly. An  example for a 20-knot headwind is shown in  Figure 5-13 .  The speed to fly in a 20-knot headwind is found to be 60  knots. By repeating the procedure for different headwinds,  it is apparent that flying a faster airspeed as the headwind  increases results in the greatest distance over the ground. If  this is done for the polar curves from many gliders, a general  rule of thumb is found: add half the headwind component to  the best L/D for the maximum distance. For tailwinds, shift  the origin to the left of the zero mark on the horizontal axis.  

The speed to fly in a tailwind lies between minimum sink  and best L/D, but is never lower than minimum sink speed.  

Sinking air usually exists between thermals, and it is most  efficient to fly faster than best L/D in order to spend less time  in sinking air. How much faster to fly can be determined by  the glider polar, as illustrated in  Figure 5-14  for an air mass  that is sinking at 3 knots. The polar graph in this figure has  its vertical axis extended upwards. Shift the origin vertically  by 3 knots and draw a new tangent to the polar. Then, draw a  line vertically to read the best speed to fly. For this glider, the  best speed to fly is found to be 60 knots. Note, the variometer  shows the total sink of 5 knots (3 knots for sink and 2 knots  for the aircraft) as illustrated in the figure.  

If the glider is equipped with water ballast, wing flaps,  or wingtip extensions, the performance characteristics  of the glider is depicted in multiple configurations.  [Figures 5-15, 5-16,  and  5-17]  Comparing the polar with and  without ballast, it is evident that the minimum sink is higher  

![](images/332e012476f7ba5ac88fff837482fc5b8c6f0b19f0625890c1b87e2706e91e29.jpg)

and occurs at a higher speed.  [Figure 5-15]  With ballast, it  would be more difficult to work small, weak thermals. The  best glide ratio is the same, but it occurs at a higher speed. In  addition, the sink rate at higher speeds is lower with ballast.  From the polar, then, ballast should be used under stronger  thermal conditions for better speed between thermals. Note  that the stall speed is higher with ballast as well.  

Flaps with a negative setting as opposed to a 0 degree setting  during cruise also reduce the sink rate at higher speeds, as  shown in the polar.  [Figure 5-16]  Therefore, when cruising at  or above 70 knots, a  $-8^{\circ}$   flap setting would be advantageous  for this glider. The polar with flaps set at  $-8^{\circ}$   does not extend  to speeds lower than 70 knots since the negative flap setting  loses its advantage there.  

Wingtip extensions also alter the polar, as shown in  Figure 5-17 . The illustration shows that the additional  3 meters of wingspan is advantageous at all speeds. In  some gliders, the low-speed performance is better with the  tip extensions, while high-speed performance is slightly  diminished by comparison.  

# Weight and Balance Information  

The GFM/POH provides information about the weight and  balance of the glider. This information is correct when the  glider is new as delivered from the factory. Subsequent  maintenance and modifications can alter weight and balance  considerably. Changes to the glider that affect weight and  balance should be noted in the airframe logbook and on  appropriate cockpit placards that might list, for example,  “Maximum Fuselage Weight: 460 pounds.”  

Weight is a major factor in glider construction and operation;  it demands respect from all pilots. The pilot should always be  aware of proper weight management and the consequences  of overloading the glider.  

# Limitations  

Whether the glider is very simple or very complex, designers  and manufacturers provide operating limitations to ensure  the safety of flight. The VG diagram provides the pilot with  information on the design limitations of the glider, such as  limiting airspeeds and load factors (L.F. in  Figure 5-18 ).

Pilots should become familiar with all the operating  limitations of each glider being flown.  Figure 5-18  shows four  different possible conditions and the basic flight envelope for  a high performance glider.  

# Weight and Balance  

# Center of Gravity  

Longitudinal balance affects the stability of the longitudinal  axis of the glider. To achieve satisfactory pitch attitude handling  in a glider, the CG of the properly loaded glider is forward of  the center of pressure (CP). When a glider is produced, the  manufacturer provides glider CG limitations, which require  compliance. These limitations are generally found in the GFM/ POH and may also be found in the glider airframe logbook.  Addition or removal of equipment, such as radios, batteries,  or flight instruments, or airframe repairs can have an effect on  the CG position. Aviation maintenance technicians (AMTs)  must record any changes in the weight and balance data in the  GFM/POH or glider airframe logbook. Weight and balance  placards in the cockpit must also be updated.  

# Problems Associated With CG Forward of Forward  Limit  

If the CG is within limits, pitch attitude control stays within  acceptable limits. However, if the glider is loaded so the CG  is forward of the forward limit, handling is compromised.  The glider is said to be nose heavy. Nose heaviness makes  it difficult to raise the nose on takeoff and considerable back  pressure on the control stick is required to control the pitch  attitude. Tail stalls occur at airspeeds higher than normal and  are followed by a rapid nose-down pitch tendency. Restoring  a normal flight attitude during stall recoveries takes longer.  The landing flare is more difficult than normal, or perhaps  even impossible, due to nose heaviness. Inability to flare  could result in a hard nose-first landing.  

The following are the most common reasons for CG forward  of forward limit:  

•	 Pilot weight exceeds the maximum permitted pilot  weight. •	 Seat or nose ballast weights are installed but are not  required due to the weight of the pilot.

# Problems Associated With CG Aft of Aft Limit  

If the glider is loaded so the CG location is behind the aft  limit, handling is compromised. The glider is said to be tail  heavy. Tail heaviness can make pitch control of the glider  difficult or even impossible.  

The fundamental problem with a CG aft of the aft limit is the  designed function of the horizontal stabilizer and elevator.  Fixed wing aircraft are generally designed so that the horizontal  stabilizer and elevator provide a down force to counter the  slightly nose forward CG such that the aircraft tend to resume  a level pitch attitude after an upset about the lateral axis. As  the airspeed changes, the pilot changes the trim or trims the  aircraft so the down force exactly balances the forward CG  within limits. Should the aircraft be upset and the nose pitches  upward, the resultant slower airspeed results in less down  force produced by the horizontal stabilizer and elevator. This  decreased down force lets the nose lower so the airspeed  retains to the pre-upset value. This is called positive stability.  Conversely, if the upset places the aircraft in a nose down  attitude, the increased airspeed will increase the down force and  raise the nose to the pre-upset balanced condition. However,  if the control surface is in a stalled condition, this stabilizing  action will not begin until the control surface regains un-stalled  airflow and begins producing down force again.  

The following are the most common reasons for flight with  CG located behind permissible limits:  

•	 Pilot weight is less than the specified minimum pilot  seat weight and trim ballast weights necessary for  the lightweight pilot are not installed in the glider  prior to flight. •	 Tailwheel dolly is still attached, far aft on the tailboom  of the glider. •	 Foreign matter or debris (water, ice, mud, sand, and  nests) has accumulated in the aft fuselage of the glider  and was not discovered and removed prior to flight. •	 A heavy, non-approved tailwheel or tail skid was  installed on the aft tail boom of the glider.  

# Sample Weight and Balance Problems  

Some glider manufacturers provide weight and balance  information in a graphic presentation. A well designed graph  provides a convenient way to determine whether the glider  is within weight and balance limitations.  

In  Figure 5-19 , the chart indicates that the minimum weight  for the front seat pilot is 125 pounds, and that the maximum  is 250 pounds. It also indicates that the maximum rear seat  pilot weight is 225 pounds. If each pilot weighs 150 pounds,  the intersection of pilot weights falls within the envelope;  

![](images/fc73de1f313fab81b79e11ae8fec44261c761692c59be77d20139f47a0a6fd36.jpg)  
Figure 5-19.  Weight and balance envelope.  

the glider load is within the envelope and is safe for flight. If  each pilot weighs 225 pounds, the rear seat maximum load  is exceeded, and the glider load is outside the envelope and  unsafe for flight.  

The CG position can also be determined by calculation using  the following formulas:  

${\mathrm{weight}}\times{\mathrm{Arm}}={\mathrm{Moment}}$  •	 Total Moment  $\div$   Total Weight  $=$   CG Position (in inches  aft of the reference datum)  

The computational method involves the application of  basic math functions. The following is an example of the  computational method.  

Maximum gross weight....................1,100 lb Empty weight.......................................600 lb CG range....................................14.8–18.6 in Front seat occupant..............................180 lb Rear seat occupant...............................200 lb  

To determine the loaded weight and CG, follow these steps.  

1.	 List the empty weight of the glider and the weight of  the occupants. 2.	 Enter the moment for each item listed. Remember,  weight  $\times\ \mathrm{arm}\;=$  moment. To simplify calculations,  the moments may be divided by 100. 3.	 Total the weight and moments. 4.	 To determine the CG, divide the moments by  the weight.  

NOTE: The weight and balance records for a particular  glider provide the empty weight and moment, as well as the  information on the arm distance.  [Figure 5-20]  

![Figure 5-20.  Weight and balance: front and rear seat pilot weights  and moments. ](images/f90cff4776b926836e45230d74599cd908404d3f417ea77ddf8d95f834dc6df3.jpg)  

In  Figure 5-20,  the weight of each pilot has been entered  into the correct block in the table. For the front seat pilot,  multiplying 180 pounds by  $+30$   inches yields a moment of   $+5{,}400$   inch·pounds. For the rear seat pilot, multiplying 200  pounds by  $^{-5}$   inches yields a moment of  $_{-1,000}$   inch·pounds. The next step is to find the sum of all weights (980 pounds)  and record it. Then, find the sum of all moments   $(+16{,}400$  inch·pounds) and record it. Now, find the arm (the CG  position) of the loaded glider. Divide the total moment by the  total weight to discover the CG of the loaded aircraft glider  in inches from the datum:  

#  $+16{,}400$   inch·pounds  $\div\980\nobreakspace$   pounds  $=+16.73$   inches  

The final step is to determine whether total weight and CG  location values are within acceptable limits. The GFM/ POH lists the maximum gross weight as 1,100 pounds. The  operating weight of 980 pounds is less than the 1,100 pounds  maximum gross weight. The GFM/POH lists the approved  CG range as between  $+14.80$   inches and  $+18.60$   inches from  the datum. The operating CG is  $+16.73$   inches from the datum  and is within these limits. The weight and balance are within  operating limits.  

# Ballast  

Ballast is nonstructural weight that is added to a glider.  In soaring, ballast weight is used for two purposes. Trim  ballast is used to adjust the location of the CG of the glider  so handling characteristics remain within acceptable limits.  Performance ballast is loaded into the glider to improve  high-speed cruise performance.  

Removable trim ballast weights are usually made of metal and  are bolted into a ballast receptacle incorporated in the glider  structure. The manufacturer generally provides an attachment  point well forward in the glider cabin for trim ballast weights.  These weights are designed to compensate for a front seat  pilot who weighs less than the minimum permissible front  seat pilot weight. The ballast weight mounted well forward in  the glider cabin helps place the CG within permissible limits,  which allows the maximum shift in CG with the minimum  addition of weight.  

Some trim ballast weights are in the form of seat cushions,  with sand or lead shot sewn into the unit to provide additional  weight. This type of ballast, which is installed under the  pilot’s seat cushion, is inferior to bolted-in ballast because  seat cushions tend to shift position. Seat cushion ballast  should never be used during acrobatic or inverted flight.  

Sometimes trim ballast is water placed in a tail tank in the  vertical fin of the fuselage. The purpose of the fin trim ballast  tank is to adjust CG location after water is added to, or drained  from, the main wing ballast tanks. Unless the main wing  ballast tanks are precisely centered on the CG of the loaded  aircraft glider, CG location shifts when water is added to the  main ballast tanks. CG location shifts again when water is  dumped from the main ballast tanks. Adjusting the amount of  water in the fin tank compensates for CG shifts resulting from  changes in the amount of water ballast carried in the main  wing ballast tanks. Water weighs 8.35 pounds per gallon.  Because the tail tank is located far aft, it does not take much  water to have a considerable effect on CG location. For this  reason, tail tanks do not need to contain a large volume of  water. Tail tank maximum water capacity is generally less  than two gallons of water.  

Although some older gliders employed bags of sand or  bolted-in lead weights as performance ballast, water is used  most commonly to enhance high-speed performance in  modern sailplanes. Increasing the operating weight of the  glider increases the optimum speed to fly during wings-level  cruising flight. The resulting higher groundspeed provides  a very desirable advantage in cross-country soaring and in  sailplane racing.  

Water ballast tanks are located in the main wing panels. Clean  water is added through fill ports in the top of each wing.  In most gliders, the water tanks or bags can be partially or  completely filled, depending on the pilot’s choice of operating  weight. After water is added, the filler caps are replaced to  prevent water from sloshing out of the filler holes.  

Drain valves are fitted to the bottom of each tank. The valves  are controlled from inside the cockpit. The tanks can be fully  or partially drained while the glider is on the ground to reduce  the weight of the glider prior to launch, if the pilot so desires.  The ballast tanks also can be partially or completely drained  in flight—a process called dumping ballast. The long streaks  of white spray behind a speeding airborne glider are dramatic  evidence that the glider pilot is dumping water ballast, most  likely to lighten the glider prior to landing. The filler caps are  vented to allow air to enter the tanks to replace the volume of  water draining from the tanks. It is important to ensure that  the vents are working properly to prevent wing damage when  water ballast is drained or jettisoned.  [Figures 5-21  and  5-22]  

![](images/306858613da63b4fbfe7ec8fc78a50ffac92a526a5d696c918c40b90da16fb9c.jpg)  
Figure 5-21.  Water ballast tank vented filler cap.  

It is important to check the drain valves for correct operation  prior to flight. Water ballast should drain from each wing  tank at the same rate. Unequal draining leads to a wing-heavy  condition that makes in-flight handling, as well as landings,  more difficult. If the wing-heavy condition is extreme, it is  possible the pilot will lose control of the glider.  

Ballast drains should also be checked to ensure that water  ballast drains properly into the airstream, rather than leaking  into the fuselage and pooling in the bottom of the fuselage.  Water that is trapped in the fuselage may flow through or  over bulkheads, causing dislocation of the CG of the glider.  This CG dislocation can lead to loss of control of the glider.  

The flight manual provides guidance regarding the length  of time it takes for the ballast tanks to drain completely. For  modern gliders, it takes about 3 to 5 minutes to drain a full  tank. When landing is imminent, dump ballast early enough  to give the ballast drains sufficient time to empty the tanks.  

Use of water ballast when ambient temperatures are low can  result in water freezing the drain valve. If the drain valve  freezes, dumping ballast is difficult or impossible. If water  in the wings is allowed to freeze, serious wing damage is  likely to occur. Damage occurs because the volume of water  expands during the freezing process. The resulting increased  volume can deform ribs and other wing structures or cause  glue bonds to delaminate. When weather or flight conditions  are very cold, do not use water ballast unless antifreeze has  been added to the water. Prior to using an antifreeze solution,  consult the GFM to ensure that antifreeze compounds are  approved for use in the glider.  

A glider carrying large amounts of water ballast has  noticeably different handling characteristics than the same  glider without water ballast. Water ballast:  

•	 Reduces the rate of acceleration of the glider at  the beginning of the launch due to the increased  glider weight. •	 Increases the length of ground roll prior to glider liftoff. •	 Increases stall speed. •	 Reduces aileron control during the takeoff roll,  increasing the chance of uncontrolled wing drop and  resultant ground loop. •	 Reduces rate of climb during climb-out. •	 Reduces aileron response during free flight. The  addition of large amounts of water increases lateral  stability substantially. This makes quick banking  maneuvers difficult or impossible to perform.  

Water ballast is routinely dumped before landing to reduce  the weight of the glider. Dumping ballast:  

•	 Decreases stall speed. •	 Decreases the optimum airspeed for the landing  approach. •	 Shortens landing roll.

Figure 5-22.  Water ballast drain valve handles.  

•	 Reduces the load that glider structures must support  during landing and rollout.  

The performance advantage of water ballast during strong  soaring conditions is considerable. However, there is a down  side. The pilot should be aware that water ballast degrades  takeoff performance, climb rate, and low-speed handling.  Before committing to a launch with water ballast aboard,  the pilot should review operating limitations to ensure that  safety of flight is not compromised.  

# Chapter 6 Preflight and Ground Operations  

# Introduction  

Operating a glider requires meticulous assembly and  preflight. Proper assembly techniques, followed by a close  inspection of the glider using checklists contained in the  Glider Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook (GFM/ POH), are essential for flight safety. In order to ensure correct  and safe procedures for assembly of a glider, students and  pilots unfamiliar with glider assembly should seek instruction  from a knowledgeable glider flight instructor or certificated  private or higher glider pilot. Safely launching a glider  requires careful inspection, appropriate use of checklists, and  quality teamwork. Launch procedures should be carried out  systematically and consistently for each flight.  

# Assembly and Storage Techniques  

The assembly of a glider to include the installation of glider  wings and tail surfaces is classified as operations functions  not preventative maintenance. This information can be found  in Amendment 43-27, published in 52 FR 17276, May 6,  1987 which is an amendment to 14 CFR part 43. Prior to  assembling the glider, the pilot must check the required  documentation that must be on board the glider for flight as  required by Title 14 of the Code of Federal regulations (14  CFR) parts 21 and 91. Required documentation includes:  

•	 Airworthiness certificate •	 Registration •	 Required placards •	 GFM/POH  

While preparing to assemble a glider, consider the following  elements: location, number of crewmembers, tools and parts  necessary, and checklists that detail the appropriate assembly  procedures. Glider pilots should also develop and follow a  procedure, or procedures, to deal with distractions that may  occur during the glider assembly. Something as simple as  rechecking the previous two steps and then continuing the  checklist steps might be sufficient. The GFM/POH should  contain checklists for assembling and preflighting a glider. If  not, develop one and follow it every flight. Haphazard assembly  and preflight procedures can lead to unsafe conditions.  

Before assembling a glider, ensure that the glider trailer is  secured with the wheel brake on and the wheels chocked.  Adjust the leveling of the trailer as needed according to the  GFM/POH so the glider can be removed without damaging  items, such as the antenna and other glider components (e.g.,  wings, tips, horizontal elevator). If using a single rigging  device, ensure that the wing holder is adjusted so the wing  does not slide out of the holder and become damaged by  striking or falling to the ground.  

Find a location that shields the project from the elements and  offers enough room for completion. Wind is an important  factor to consider during an outdoor assembly. Each wing is  an airfoil whether or not it is connected to the fuselage; even  a gentle breeze is enough to produce lift on the wings, making  them cumbersome or impossible to handle. If assembling the  glider in a spot unshielded from the wind, great care must  still be taken when handling the wings.  

When performing the assembly inside a hangar, ensure there is  enough room to maneuver the glider’s components throughout  the process. Also, consider the length of time anticipated to  complete the entire procedure, and choose an area that allows  complete undisturbed assembly. Moving the glider during  assembly may cause parts or tools to be misplaced.  

Wing stands or a wing dolly, the proper tools, wing tape, and  lubricants should be on hand when assembling the glider.  [Figure 6-1]  To stay organized, use a written assembly  checklist, and keep an inventory of parts and tools. Some  organizations track tools and components by placing all of  the necessary components and hardware used with necessary  tools on a piece of canvas or material and outlining each  tool. This facilitates a quick inventory before assembly  and afterwards. Once glider assembly is complete, pilots  should account for all parts and tools used during assembly.  Objects inadvertently misplaced in the glider could become  jammed in the flight controls, making control difficult, if not  impossible. In addition, when taping the wing roots, turtle  deck (cover where the flight controls are attached) elevator  and other areas, ensure the tape is placed properly and is  secure. If the seal tape comes off in flight, the tape may cause  control issues with the glider.  

![](images/3a73f86d945f90c4f105fd984aa741f44ce0faa77e0701f1f17c67feb534e2ff.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.  Wing stands and wing dollies are used as support when  assembling the glider.  

Depending on the type of glider, two or more people may be  required for assembly. It is important for everyone involved  to maintain focus throughout the assembly process to avoid  missed steps. Outside disturbances should also be avoided.  Once the assembly is finished, a thorough inspection of all  attach points ensures that bolts and pins were installed and  secured properly. Do not use a hammer to tap wing bolts  or other glider components in their place. The main wing  pins should slide into the socket with minimum application  of force. If the wing bolts require such force, a mechanic  should be retained to ensure that the main wing spar is not  bent or damaged.  

On most gliders, the wing can be completely removed from  the fuselage area. On some motor gliders, the wing can be  folded up for ease of storage.  [Figures 6-2]  This allows the  glider to be placed in a normal size hangar. Hangars are  usually between 35 and 45 feet in width. Because most glider  wings are a minimum of 40 feet (12 meters) total length, a  larger hangar is usually desirable.  

Once the gliders wings have been folded, the glider can  easily be moved in and around the hangar area. On some  gliders, operators may elect to leave the wings attached for  quick access. This is usually the practice at larger glider  operations. These gliders can be fitted or rolled onto a small  dolly that has castering wheels. The glider’s main wheel fits  into a slot, and the entire glider can be pivoted and moved  to accommodate other gliders.  

Once the glider has been completely assembled, the pilot  then inspects all critical areas to ensure all flight controls are  attached. The pilot should refer to a written checklist either  provided by the manufacturer or a commercial source that  prints glider checklists.  

This final check is very critical and usually takes time to  complete. Pilots should not be interrupted when they are  attempting to check the glider. The Soaring Society of America 

 (SSA) and one of its affiliates, the Soaring Safety Foundation 

 (SSF), have developed a checklist for preparing a glider, which  is Safety Advisory 00-1, Glider Critical Assembly Procedures,  and can be found in Appendix A of this handbook.  

Many manufacturers provide a critical assembly checklist  (CAC) to be completed after assembly, which is the preferred  method of ensuring a proper assembly has been completed.  When provided by the manufacturer, it is mandatory. A  positive control check (PCC) is not a CAC, but an additional  means of verification. If a CAC is provided, it must be used  as is any other checklist a manufacturer provides. A PCC is  not regulatory, but it is a good idea whether or not you just  completed the required CAC.  

# Trailering  

Specially designed trailers are used to transport, store, and  retrieve gliders.  [Figure 6-3]  The components of the glider  should fit snugly without being forced, be guarded against  chafing, and be well secured within the trailer. Once the  loading is completed, take a short drive, stop, and check for  rubbing or chafing of components. Ensure that any items  carried inside the trailer are secure from movement. For  example, jacks, ramps, wing stands, and ground dollies must  be secured so that these items do not damage the glider.  

![](images/373597f652f31ad70e1b497f7afae0fd66c520fabe1a11c69eed22c3e386561d.jpg)

Figure 6-2.  The wings of the glider can be folded in order to conveniently store the glider.  

Prior to taking the trailer on the road, complete a thorough  inspection. Ensure:  

• 	 Proper inflation of and adequate tread on trailer tires,  •  Trailer tires are rated for Special Trailer (ST) duty,  which are rated only to 65 miles per hour (mph)  towing speed. The maximum speed of   $65~\mathrm{mph}$   can  be exceeded safely if the air pressure is increased by  10 psi for every 10 mph over 65 that it is pulled and  the maximum load is decreased 10 percent for every  10 mph over 65 mph of towing speed, • 	 Operation of all lights, • 	 Free movement and lubrication of hitch, • 	 Appropriate rating of vehicle attachment for the weight  of the trailer,  • 	 Proper operation of vehicle and trailer brakes, •	 Adequate wheel bearing lubrication, and •	 Proper tow vehicle mirror adjustment.  

When using a trailer, there are other precautions to note. First,  avoid towing with too much or too little tongue weight as  either causes the trailer to fishtail at certain speeds, possibly  rendering it uncontrollable. Towing a long glider trailer  requires good driving skills and a good sense of road and  weather conditions. Take care in heavy crosswinds because  a long trailer can be affected by windy conditions. Also, take  care when unloading the glider to avoid damage. Practice and  planning are key to a successful operation.  

# Tiedown and Securing  

Anytime the glider is left unattended, it should be tied  down with the canopy closed and latched. When selecting  a tiedown location, choose a spot that faces into the wind  if possible. Permanent tiedowns are often equipped with  straps, ropes, or chains for the wings and tail. Having the  proper tie down kit is recommended for a cross-country  trip. Check tiedown conditions before using to ensure the  safety of the glider. When tying down on airports shared  by powered aircraft, propeller wash can cause damage to  an improperly secured glider.  

If strong winds are expected, tie the spoilers open with seat  belts, or place a padded stand under the tail to reduce the  angle of attack of the wings. This reduces the pull of the glider  against the tiedowns. When securing the glider outside for  an extended period of time, install gust locks on the control  surfaces to prevent them from banging against their stops  in the wind. Cover the pitot tube and the total energy probe  to prevent spiders, wasps, and other insects or debris from  getting inside.  [Figure 6-4]  

![](images/14274295288186c3c663a3e2d3b0b262413267ac308c782e56427df4d1843d24.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.  Protecting the pitot tube and total energy probe.  

Always use a cover to protect the glider canopy. It can be  damaged by blowing dust and sand or scratched by apparel,  such as watches or belt buckles. A cover protects the canopy  from damage while shielding the interior of the cockpit from  ultraviolet (UV) rays.  [Figure 6-5]  

![](images/36ca0728af0df6a4a6e63939e5b068192b1fccb6ed5bf4379d2474bc2b783c91.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.  Protecting the canopy.  

# Water Ballast  

When transporting a glider or parking the glider for long  periods of time, especially overnight the water ballast should  be emptied due to the danger of freezing. This is usually done  while in flight before landing. When de-rigging, the water  ballast tanks will empty themselves through the wing root  connecting pipes. If the glider has to be towed for a long way  it is best to empty the water tanks. If that is not an option,  ensure that antifreeze is added to prevent freezing when  traveling in cold temperatures.  

# Ground Handling  

Moving a glider on the ground requires special handling  procedures, especially during high winds. Normally, gliders  are pushed or pulled by hand or towed with a vehicle. When  moving a glider, ensure that all appropriate personnel have  been briefed on procedures and signals.  

When using a vehicle to tow a glider, use a towline that is  more than half the wingspan of the glider. If one wingtip  stops moving for any reason, this towline length prevents  the glider from pivoting and striking the tow vehicle with  the opposite wingtip. Full wingspan length is desirable;  however, half the wingspan plus 10 feet provides safe  operation. Ensure that the glider canopy is always closed  if no one is around the glider. This prevents the wind, or  turbulence from a taxiing towplane, to cause the canopy to  close abruptly, which could damage the canopy frame or  even crack the canopy glass.  

When starting, slowly take up slack in the line with the  vehicle to prevent sudden jerking of the glider. The towing  speed should be no faster than a brisk walk. When towing a  glider, always use at least one wing walker. The wing walker  and the driver of the tow vehicle function as a team, alert  for obstacles, wind, and any other factor that may affect the  safety of the glider. The driver should always stay alert for  any signals from the wing walkers.  [Figure 6-6]  

![](images/8095d88bd9fc4c4d9fc82c34127a425d56c32618becefc3f2495ade274ac11cd.jpg)  
Figure 6-6.  Positioning the glider for the tow vehicle.  

If it is necessary to move the glider during high winds, use  two or more crewmembers placed at the wingtips and tail.  Also, have a pilot in the cockpit, with the spoilers deployed,  holding the controls appropriately to reduce lift on the glider.  Strong winds and gusts can cause damage to the glider during  ground handling, so exercise care during these conditions.  

Another method of towing uses specially designed towing  gear similar to a trailer tow bar that attaches directly to a  vehicle towing a trailer. The tow bar makes guiding the glider  much easier and allows the wing walkers to concentrate on  ensuring wingtip clearances.  [Figure 6-7]  

# Launch Equipment Inspection  

Prior to making a flight, it is important to inspect the condition  of the towline/towrope. The glider pilot is primarily responsible  for inspection and selection of the proper towrope. However,  the tow pilot has a responsibility to ensure that the towrope  selection meets the criteria stated in 14 CFR part 91 and is  acceptable for use. This inspection is the responsibility of  the tow pilot. The towline should be free from excess wear;  all strands should be intact, and the line should be free from  knots. Towropes should be inspected prior to every flight.  Consideration should be given in replacing the towrope after a  period of time due to usage and ultraviolet (UV) exposure from  being in the sun and exposed to the elements.  [Figure 6-8]  14  CFR part 91, section 91.309, requires that the strength of the  towline be within a range of 80 to 200 percent of the maximum  certificated weight of the glider. If the towrope is more than  twice the maximum strength, a safety link is required between  the tow rope and glider rated at not less than 80 percent of  the maximum certified operating weight of the glider but not  greater than twice the operating weight. Also, a safety link  must be installed between the towing aircraft and towrope  with breaking strength greater than the glider safety link, but  no more than 25 percent greater, and not greater than twice the  maximum certificated weight of the glider.  Figure 6-9  shows  the strength of some ropes typically used.  

![](images/b60bffde82b0412e2e6c522a9693e49079d5247b24eec29ce89a142fdbc6abcb.jpg)

![Figure 6-9.  Rope strengths. ](images/602106770af01d42ae6529b46eb6438f44f8d5aa84c69791630c444841300b47.jpg)  

A knot in the towline reduces its strength by up to 50 percent,  and causes a high spot in the rope that is more susceptible to  wear. Pay particular attention to the ring area to which the  glider attaches because this is also a high-wear area.  

The safety link is constructed of towline with a towring on  one end and the other end spliced into a loop. The weak link at  the glider attach end of the towline must be 80 to 200 percent  of the maximum certificated operating weight of the glider.  The safety link at the towplane attach end must be of greater  strength than the safety link at the glider attach end of the  towline, but not more than 25 percent greater, nor greater than  200 percent of the maximum certificated weight of the glider.  Towlines and weak links are assembled using a towring that is  appropriate for the operation. Lightweight balls are attached  to the towline to help protect the towline, prevent line rash,  and prevents the line from whipping.  [Figure 6-10]  

The tow hooks on both the glider and the towplane need to be  inspected. The two most common types of tow hook are an  over-the-top design, such as a Schweizer hook, or a grasping  style, such as a Tost hook. Any tow hook must be freely  operating, and free from damage.  [Figures 6-11  and  6-12]

# Glider Preflight Inspection  

A thorough inspection of the glider should be accomplished  before launch. A preflight checklist for a glider should be  in the GFM/POH. If not, develop a checklist using the  guidelines contained in  Figure 6-13 .

# Prelaunch Checklist  

Adjustments to the pilot or passenger seats, as well as  adjustable controls, such as rudder pedals, should be made  prior to buckling the seat belt and shoulder harness. Caution  should be exercised to avoid crimping or clamping the oxygen  supply. At this point, especially if the glider has just been  assembled, it is appropriate to do a positive control check  with the help of one crewmember. While the pilot moves the  control stick, the crewmember alternately holds each aileron  and the elevator to provide resistance. This also applies to the  spoilers and flaps, and ensures the control connections are  correct and secure. If the stick moves freely while the control  surfaces are being restricted, the connections are not secure,  and the glider is not airworthy.  [Figure 6-14]  

If the GFM/POH does not provide a specific prelaunch  checklist, then some good generic checklists are CB  SWIFT CBE and ABCCCDD, which are explained in  Figure 6-15.  Regardless of which checklist you elect to use,  have a plan. Stay with that checklist and ensure that each  step is being carefully followed.  

# Glider Care  

Depending on the type of glider, different cleaning methods  should be employed. After all flights, wipe down the glider  with a soft cloth or a wet chamois. This removes any debris  

![](images/9cdaf394238c358fe67ce89429822b0b2de368c7de79167cbb9c785bc784e12d.jpg)  
Figure 6-14.  Positive control check of spoilers.  

or bugs. This should be done in a timely manner because  waiting too long allows bugs to dry making removal difficult.  

Training gliders made of fabric should be cleaned with spray- on and wash-off products. Avoid using large amounts of  water as the water may penetrate cracks and holes, especially  on earlier wooded or vintage gliders, which damages and  reduces the life of the fabric or wood. Moisture damages  any glider if allowed to stay wet. On metal gliders, a low- pressure hose and mild detergent is used for cleaning. For  

![](images/a1bbd30af23e72236b12a5002e18345728ec52d5d14dedae4526d91a519a056c.jpg)  

high performance fiberglass gliders, use a special spray or  cleaning paste. Consult the GFH/POH, or a glider supply  store, for proper materials based on the type of glider. Care  must be taken when cleaning high performance and fiberglass  gliders. The use of buffers should be avoided, as the buffer  may burn the fiberglass if not done in a proper manner.  

After cleaning, a coat of wax or a sealer is usually applied  to fabric, metal, and fiberglass gliders. When applying wax  to fiberglass gliders, it is recommended to use a silicon-free  wax. Silicon adheres to the pores in the fiberglass and makes  any type of future repairs extremely difficult. After applying  any wax, use a clean, soft cloth to wipe off excess wax and  buff the area by hand. For the cleaning of the canopy, care  must be taken and only recommended cleaners for the specific  type of canopy should be used.  

Minor repairs on fiberglass gliders can be performed by  the owner/pilot. Consult a fiberglass expert prior to making  any minor repair, such as a scratch or chip. Always use  approved parts and materials when conducting these repairs.  All certifications of gliders, either standard or experimental,  should be repaired in accordance with the manufacturer’s  recommended procedures and 14 CFR part 43. Pilots should  always refer to the specific GFM/POH for any additional care  and cleaning of the glider.

# Launch and Recovery  Procedures and Flight  Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

In the early days of soaring, gliders were launched from  the top of a hill into the wind by means of bungee cord, a  stretchable cord made of rubber bands. The tail of the glider  was held back or tied down, and the bungee was attached  at its midpoint to a hook on the nose of the glider. Then, a  group of people took each end and, when the signals were  given, they walked, then ran with the bungee as hard as they  could. When the tension became quite high, the tail tie-down  was severed, or released, and the glider shot ahead as though  it had been launched from a slingshot.  

As gliders got heavier and better, pilots began to look for  improved ways to launch. It was not long before enthusiasts  began to use cars to pull shock cords and then to pull the  gliders by the long wire or rope. Once again, improvements  in technology and equipment were introduced and powered  winches and airplane towing became the preferred method  of launching gliders.  

This chapter discusses several glider launch techniques and  procedures along with takeoff procedures, traffic patterns,  flight maneuvers, and landing and recovery procedures.  Additional information may be found at the Soaring Society  of America (SSA) website at www.ssa.org and the Soaring  Safety Foundation website at www.soaringsafety.org.  

# Aerotow Takeoff Procedures  

# Signals  

Launching a nonpowered glider requires the use of visual  signals for communication and coordination between the  glider, towing aircraft, and the ground crew. Ground launching  signals consist of prelaunch signals and in-flight signals.  

# Prelaunch Signals  

Aerotow prelaunch signals facilitate communication between  pilots and launch crewmembers/wing runners preparing for  the launch. These signals are shown in  Figure 7-1 .  

![](images/b9571f561a0095812449a38bfaa3ff5b9037cbd2cda00ea8a61c0ed568dfd9f2.jpg)  
Figure 7-1.  Aerotow prelaunch signals.  

# Inflight Signals  

Visual signals allow the tow pilot and the glider pilot to  communicate with each other. The signals are divided into  two types: those from the tow pilot to the glider pilot and  signals from the glider pilot to the tow pilot. These signals  are shown in  Figure 7-2 .  

# Takeoff Procedures and Techniques  

Takeoff procedures for gliders require close coordination  between launch crewmembers, wing runners, and pilots.  Both the glider pilot and tow pilot must be familiar with the  appropriate tow procedures. The assisted takeoff includes  a wing runner that holds the wing in a level position. An  unassisted takeoff does not include a wing runner or other  ground crew. The unassisted launch requires good procedures  and should only be attempted by highly experienced glider  and tow pilots. It is recommended that all takeoffs include  a ground crewmember for traffic scanning and general  assistance during the takeoff.  

It is very important to never connect a glider to a towplane  or towline unless the pilot is aboard and ready for flight. If  the pilot exits the glider for any reason, the towline should  be released and disconnected because some hitches like a  Tost hitch require slight pressure for the tow ring to actually  move from the jaws. If no tension is applied, the ring stays  in place and connected when the jaws close.  

Normal takeoffs are made into the wind. Prior to takeoff, the  tow pilot and glider pilot must reach an agreement on the  plan for the aerotow. The glider pilot should ensure that the  launch crewmember is aware of safety procedures concerning  the tow. Some of these items would be proper runway and  pattern clearing procedures and glider configuration checks  (spoilers closed, tailwheel dolly removed, canopy secured).  

![](images/cd29edd4d9b1c95b4bda0897ef29e830247a4b69d1701e1447c26c9177ecbdfc.jpg)  
Figure 7-2.  Inflight aerotow visual signals.  

When the required checklists have been completed and both  the glider and towplane are ready for takeoff, the glider pilot  signals the launch crewmember/wing runner to hook the  towline to the glider.  

# Normal Assisted Takeoff  

The towrope hookup should be done deliberately and correctly,  and the release mechanism should be checked for proper  operation. The launch crewmember/wing runner applies  tension to the towline and signals the glider pilot to activate the  release. The launch crewmember should verify that the release  works properly and signal the glider pilot. When the towline  is hooked up to the glider again, the launch crewmember  repositions to the wing that is down. When the glider pilot  signals “ready for takeoff,” the launch crewmember/wing  runner clears both the takeoff and landing area, and then signals  the tow pilot to “take up slack” in the towline. Once the slack  is out of the towline, the launch crewmember verifies that the  glider pilot is ready for takeoff; this may include a “thumbs  up” by the glider pilot. The crewmember/wing runner does a  final traffic pattern check, and then raises the wings to a level  position. With the wings raised, the crewmember/wing runner  then signals the tow pilot for takeoff. At the same time, the  glider pilot signals the tow pilot by wagging the rudder back  and forth, concurring with the launch crewmember’s/wing  runner’s takeoff signal. If a radio is used, the glider pilot  advises the tow pilot that he or she is ready for takeoff, stating  “Canopy and dive/air brakes closed and locked.”  

As the launch begins and the glider accelerates, the launch  crewmember/wing runner runs alongside the glider, holding  the wing level. When the glider achieves lift-off speed, the  glider pilot should allow the glider to become just barely  airborne and level behind the towplane’s tail, as it accelerates  to climb speed. The glider pilot must be precise in controlling  the glider at this very low altitude of 2 to 4 feet, more or less  depending on the aircraft involved. Any large excursions  from the position of level directly behind the towplane’s tail  can lead to disaster for the tow pilot and the glider pilot(s).  The glider pilot must not climb above the towplane’s tail,  as this can force the towplane’s propeller into the runway  surface. Lateral glider deviations side to side can drive the  towplane off the runway.  The glider pilot should maintain  this altitude by applying forward stick pressure, as necessary,  while the glider is accelerating. Once the towplane lifts off,  it accelerates in ground effect to the desired climb airspeed,  and then the climb begins for both the glider and towplane.  

During takeoff while at very low altitudes, it may be necessary  to steer the glider solely with the rudder due to the very long  wings of most gliders. The long wings, combined with very  short landing gear stances, make gliders prone to hitting  runway lights and signage. Keeping the glider’s wings level  helps prevent collisions with obstructions but restricts aileron  usage close to the surface. Control the bank angle of the wings  with the ailerons. Full deflection of the flight controls may  be necessary at low airspeeds, but the flight controls become  more effective as airspeed increases.  [Figure 7-3]  

![](images/0c355f0913200607cf0129d3fc74a6e1c5b9b68017150d666502b412adbf745f.jpg)  
Figure 7-3.  Tracking the runway centerline.  

In most takeoffs, the glider achieves flying airspeed before  the towplane. However, if the glider is a heavily ballasted  glider, the towplane may be able to achieve liftoff airspeed  before the glider. In such a situation, the towplane should  remain in ground effect until the glider is off the ground.  Climb-out must not begin until the previously determined  climb airspeed has been achieved.  

One of the most dangerous occurrences during aerotow is  allowing the glider to fly high above and losing sight of the  towplane. The tension on the towline caused by the glider  pulls the towplane tail up, lowering its nose. If the glider  continues to rise, pulling the towplane tail higher, the tow  pilot may not be able to raise the nose. Ultimately, the tow  pilot may run out of up elevator authority.  

In some towhook systems, the high pressure loading on the  towhook causes towhook seizure, and the tow pilot may  not be able to release the towline from the towplane. This  situation can be critical if it occurs at altitudes below 500 feet  above ground level (AGL). Upon losing sight of the towplane,  the glider pilot must release immediately.  

# Unassisted Takeoff  

The unassisted takeoff is basically conducted in the same  manner as a normal takeoff, but the glider is positioned slightly  off the runway heading (runway centerline) by approximately   $10{-}20^{\circ}$   with one wing on the ground. If the glider is canted to  the right, then the right wing would be resting on the ground.  To the left, the left wing would be resting on the ground.  When the glider pilot is ready for takeoff, he or she advises  the tow pilot either by radio, which is the preferred method, or  by signaling the tow pilot with the “ready for takeoff” rudder  waggle signal, as in the assisted takeoff. As the towplane  accelerates, the wing on the ground (trailing wing) accelerates  at a slightly faster rate as it is pulled in a slight arc, allowing  that wing to rise quickly with little dragging.  

If the glider is aligned with the towplane during the takeoff, the  wing that is on the ground has a tendency to be dragged and a  ground loop may occur (or severe swerving). After the wings  are level, proceed as in the normal takeoff configuration.  

# Crosswind Takeoff  

Crosswind takeoff procedures are a modification of the  normal takeoff procedure. The following are the main  differences in crosswind takeoffs:  

•	 The glider tends to weathervane into the wind any time  the main wheel is touching the ground. The stronger  the crosswind is, the greater the tendency of the glider  is to turn into the wind. •	 After lift-off, the glider tends to drift downwind off the  runway centerline. The stronger the crosswind is, the  greater the tendency of the glider is to drift downwind.  

# Assisted  

Prior to takeoff, the glider pilot should coordinate with the  launch crewmember to hold the upwind wing slightly low  during the initial takeoff roll. If a crosswind is indicated,  full aileron should be held into the wind as the takeoff roll is  started. This control position should be maintained while the  glider is accelerating and until the ailerons become effective  for maneuvering the glider about its longitudinal (roll) axis.  With the aileron held into the wind, the takeoff path must  be held straight with the rudder. This requires application  of downwind rudder pressure, since the glider tends to  weathervane into the wind while on the ground.  [Figure 7-4] As the glider’s forward speed increases, the crosswind  

![](images/66d7bb429e57a8e2235dbed5f1f2df04ab376f55fb7d76ae84d17ede39c7b8f8.jpg)  
Figure 7-4.  Crosswind correction for takeoff.  

becomes more of a relative headwind; the mechanical  application of full aileron into the wind should be reduced. It  is when increasing pressure is being felt on the aileron control  that the ailerons are becoming more effective. Because the  crosswind component effect does not completely dissipate,  some aileron pressure must be maintained throughout the  takeoff roll to prevent the crosswind from raising the upwind  wing. If the upwind wing rises, exposing more wing surface to  the crosswind, a skipping action may result, as indicated by a  series of small bounces occurring when the glider attempts to  fly and then settles back onto the runway. This side skipping  imposes side loads on the landing gear. Keeping the upwind  wingtip slightly lower than the downwind wingtip prevents  the crosswind from getting underneath the upwind wing and  lifting it. If the downwind wingtip touches the ground, the  resulting friction may cause the glider to yaw in the direction  of the dragging wingtip. This yaw could lead to a loss of  directional control and runway departure.  

While on the runway throughout the takeoff, the glider pilot  uses the rudder to maintain directional control and alignment  behind the towing aircraft. Yawing back and forth behind the  towplane should be avoided, as this affects the ability of the  towplane pilot to maintain control. If glider controllability  becomes a problem, the glider pilot must release and stop  the glider on the remaining runway. Remember, as the glider  slows, the crosswind may cause it to weathervane into the wind.  

Prior to the towplane becoming airborne, and after the glider  lifts off, the glider pilot should turn into the wind and establish  a wind correction angle to remain behind the towplane. This is  accomplished by using coordinated control inputs to turn the  glider. Once the towplane becomes airborne and establishes  a wind correction angle, the glider pilot repositions to align  behind the towplane.  

# Unassisted  

Just as in the unassisted takeoff with no wind, the unassisted  crosswind takeoff is conducted slightly differently with  regard to wing positioning and glider alignment. The glider  should be placed on the upwind side of the runway or take  area; if unable, the towplane should try to angle into the  wind as best as possible to reduce the crosswind component  for the glider. Most gliders have a crosswind limit up to  approximately 10–12 knots. See the Glider Flight Manual/ Pilot’s Operating Handbook (GFM/POH) for information  specific to your glider. Again, the unassisted launch should  be attempted only by highly experienced pilots.  

The glider should be placed with the upwind wing on the  ground and the glider angled approximately  $20–30^{\circ}$   into the  wind.  [Figure 7-5]  If the upwind wing is permitted to be up  during the takeoff run, the glider pilot finds it very difficult  

![](images/1eb111c1490fa7eafa5c5287d2c18faa13fc47ae077bb262b9f234e6684835c7.jpg)  
Figure 7-5.  When setting up for a crosswind takeoff, the glider  should be placed on the upwind side of the runway.  

to level the wings. A ground loop usually results since the  downwind wing is being dragged along the ground. With  the upwind wing on the ground during the early stages of  the takeoff, the glider pilot finds it easier to level the wings  early in the takeoff. As in the unassisted takeoff, the upwind  wing is swung forward at a faster rate than the downwind  wing, aiding the pilot in leveling the wings. The crosswind  strikes the fuselage of the glider, tending to push it downwind,  making it necessary to place the glider on the upwind side  of the runway. Execute a crosswind takeoff from this point  after both wings are level.  

Common errors in aerotow takeoffs include:  

•	 Improper glider configuration for takeoff, •	 Improper initial positioning of flight controls, •	 Improper alignment of the glider (unassisted takeoff), •	 Improper use of visual launch signals, •	 Failure to maintain alignment behind towplane before  towplane becomes airborne, •	 Improper alignment with the towplane after becoming  airborne, and •	 Climbing too high after lift-off and causing a  towplane upset.  

# Aerotow Climb-Out  

Once airborne and climbing, the glider can fly one of two tow  positions. High tow is aerotow flight with the glider positioned  slightly above the wake of the towplane. Low tow is aerotow  flight with the glider positioned just below the wake of the  towplane.  [Figure 7-6]  Climbing turns are made with shallow  bank angles and the glider in the high tow position. Pilots  are trained using these positions to learn coordinated towing  procedures and understanding the dynamics of the aerotow. In  training, glider pilots are advised to control vertical position  relative to the towplane using the horizon.  

The glider pilot’s sight picture depends on the type of towplane  being used for the launch. The instructor, through flight  experience, can determine the particular towplane’s vertical  wake boundaries and describe the positions. Sometimes,  the glider may use the picture of the towplane’s wings on  the horizon. On another type of towplane, maintaining the  towplane’s rudder centered over the fuselage of the towplane  ensures the glide is directly behind the towplane in straight  flight. Any excessive deviation from the low or high tow  position by the glider requires abnormal control inputs by the  tow pilot, which always generates more drag and degrades  climb performance during the tow.  

The towplane’s wake drifts down behind the towing aircraft.  Straight ahead climbs are made with the glider in the level or  

![](images/fc541698b4e71b421455e1e53b2a6cf8648ebef54b364c41056acf92cd0fc691.jpg)  
Figure 7-6.  Aerotow climb-out.  

high tow position. The tow pilot strives to maintain a steady  pitch attitude and a constant power setting for the desired  climb airspeed. The glider pilot uses visual references on the  towplane to maintain a proper lateral and vertical position.  

In a level flight tow, the pilot should position the glider  above the wake of the towplane. Low tow offers the glider  pilot a better view of the towplane and provides for a more  aerodynamically efficient tow, especially during climb, as  the towplane requires less upward elevator deflection due to  the downward pull of the glider. However, because of the  risk of towline fouling if the towline breaks or is released by  the towplane, low tow should be mainly used for level flight  aero-tows such as for a cross-country flight.  

Climbing turns are made with shallow bank angles in the  high tow position. During turns, the glider pilot observes  and matches the bank angle of the towplane. In order to  stay in the same flightpath of the towplane, the glider pilot  must aim the nose of the glider at the outside wingtip of the  towplane. This allows the glider’s flightpath to coincide with  the flightpath of the towplane.  [Figure 7-7]  

If the glider’s bank is steeper than the towplanes bank, the  glider’s turn radius is smaller than the towplane turn radius.  [Figure 7-8]  If this occurs, the reduced tension on the towline  causes it to bow and slack, allowing the glider’s airspeed  to slow. As a result, the glider begins to sink relative to  the towplane. The correct course of action is to reduce the  

![](images/9ad839ec44d7171281f9307974559c6231b4b120534984320f0041fc940343b3.jpg)

glider’s bank angle so the glider flies the same radius of turn  as the towplane. If timely corrective action is not taken and  the glider slows and sinks below the towplane, the towplane  may rapidly pull the towline taut and possibly cause it to fail  and/or cause structural damage to both aircraft.  

If the glider’s bank is shallower than the towplane, the  glider’s turn radius is larger than the towplane’s turn radius.  [Figure 7-9]  If this occurs, the increased tension on the  towline causes the glider to accelerate and climb. The correct  course of pilot action when the glider is turning outside the  towplane radius of turn is to increase glider bank angle. As  the glider moves back into position behind the towplane, the  glider corrects to the same radius of turn as the towplane. If  timely corrective action is not taken and the glider accelerates  and climbs above the towplane, the towplane may lose rudder  and elevator control. In this situation, the glider pilot should  release the towline and turn to avoid the towplane.  

Common errors in aerotow climb-out include:  

•	 Faulty procedures by not maintaining proper vertical  and lateral position during high or low tow. •	 Inadvertent entry into towplane wake. •	 Failure to maintain glider alignment during turns on  aerotow causing towplane upset.

# Aerotow Release  

Standard aerotow release procedures provide safety benefits  for both the glider and the towing aircraft. When the aerotow  reaches release position, the glider pilot should clear the area  for other aircraft in all directions, especially to the right.  Prior to release, the towline should be under normal tension  for a normal release. Depending on the hook, some tension  is required to extract the ring from the hook. The hook-type  towing attachments may need pressure to make the hook  swing open to release the hook. When ready to release, the  glider pilot pulls the release handle completely out to ensure  the towline hook is fully open to allow the release of the  towline and hold the hook release open until it is verified that  the towline is free of the glider. Generally, the release of the  towline is felt as the forward motion begins to decelerate, but  the glider pilot should always visually confirm the towline  release prior to the  $90^{\circ}$   right clearing turn.  [Figure 7-10A] Next, the glider pilot banks to the right, accomplishing  $90^{\circ}$  of heading change, then in level flight flies away from the  release point while observing the towplane actions.  

Shown in  Figure 7-10B , this  $90^{\circ}$   change of heading achieves  maximum separation between towplane and glider in  minimum time. After confirming glider release and  $90^{\circ}$   turn  away from the towplane, the tow pilot turns left away from  the release point, achieving safe maximum separation.

Figure 7-10.  Aerotow release.  

Shown in  Figure 7-10C , once clear of the glider and other  aircraft, the tow pilot then begins a descent. The tow pilot  should continue to observe the glider’s actions as the glider  pilot may have started his/hers thermalling procedure with the  possibility of the glider pilot losing sight of the towing aircraft. Common errors in aerotow release include:  

•	 Lack of normal tension on towline or slack in towline. •	 Failure to clear the area prior to release. •	 Failure to make a  $90^{\circ}$   right turn after release. •	 Release in close proximity of other aircraft. •	 Glider pilot and tow pilot losing sight of each other’s  aircraft.  

Maintaining proper release procedures is important to ensure  proper aircraft separation in case pilots lose sight of each  other’s aircraft. It is imperative for the tow pilot to exit the  immediate area of the glider release. If the glider releases in  a thermal or other lift, the glider must stay in that lift to gain  altitude, whereas the tow pilot has the ability to completely  clear the glider’s area before returning to the airport. Both  the tow pilot and glider pilot should be aware of other gliders  near areas of lift.  

# Slack Line  

Slack line is a reduction of tension in the towline. If the  slack is severe enough, it might entangle the glider or cause  damage to the glider or towplane. The following situations  may result in a slack line:  

•	 Abrupt power reduction by the towplane •	 Aerotow descents •	 Glider turns inside the towplane turn radius  [Figure 7-8] •	 Updrafts and downdrafts •	 Abrupt recovery from a wake box corner position  [Figure 7-11]  

![](images/bd100066cada183e78653bad7918f0d336671e6c9dedce6f901a413bb4dbc278.jpg)  
Figure 7-11.  Diving on towplane.  

When the towplane precedes the glider into an updraft, the  glider pilot first perceives that the towplane is climbing much  faster and higher than it actually is. Then, as the glider enters  the updraft, it is lighter and more efficient than the towplane.  It climbs higher and faster than the towplane did in the same  updraft. As a result, the glider pilot pitches the glider over  to regain the proper tow altitude but gains airspeed more  quickly than the towplane, hence the slack towline. The  glider pilot must be ready to control the descent and closure  rate to the towplane.  

Slack line recovery procedures should be initiated as soon  as the glider pilot becomes aware of the situation. The  glider pilot should try slipping back into alignment with the  towplane. In the event that slipping fails to reduce the slack  sufficiently, careful use of spoilers/dive brakes can decelerate  the glider and take up the slack. When the towline tightens,  stabilize the tow and gradually resume the desired aerotow  position. When slack in the towline is excessive, or beyond  the pilot’s capability to safely recover, the glider pilot should  immediately release from the aerotow.  

Common errors regarding a slack line include:  

•	 Failure to take corrective action at the first indication  of a slack line. •	 Use of improper procedure to correct slack line  causing excessive stress on the towline, towplane,  and the glider.  

# Boxing the Wake  

Boxing the wake is a training and performance maneuver  designed to demonstrate a pilot’s ability to accurately  maneuver the glider around the towplanes wake during  aerotow. This maneuver is used by flight instructors to teach  students how to find the towing aircraft wake; then, safely  maneuver around the wake during the aerotow.  [Figure 7-12]  

Boxing the wake requires flying a rectangular pattern around  the towplane’s wake and not the towplane. Prior to takeoff, the  glider pilot should advise the tow pilot that he or she is planning  to box the wake. Boxing the wake should commence outside  of the traffic pattern area and at no lower than 1,000 feet AGL.  

Before starting the maneuver, the glider should descend  through the wake to the center low tow position as a signal  to the tow pilot that the maneuver is about to begin. The pilot  uses coordinated control inputs to move the glider level to one  side of the wake and holds that lower corner of the rectangle  momentarily with rudder pressure.  

Applying back pressure to the control stick starts a vertical  ascent using rudder pressure to maintain equal distance  from the wake. The pilot holds the wings almost level with  the ailerons to parallel the towplane. When the glider has  attained high corner position, the pilot momentarily maintains  this position.  

![](images/9d87530ced2c12d95641fdb03edf7f911f02393ca5ab20b8b68c2b121e2cc815.jpg)  
Figure 7-12.  Boxing the wake.  

As the maneuver continues, the pilot reduces the rudder  pressure and uses coordinated flight controls to slightly bank  the glider to fly along the top side of the box. The glider  proceeds to the opposite corner using aileron and rudder  pressure, as appropriate. The pilot maintains this position  momentarily with rudder pressure, then begins a vertical  descent by applying forward pressure to the control stick.  Rudder pressure is used to maintain glider position at an  equal distance from the wake.  

The pilot holds the wings level with the ailerons to parallel the  towplane. When the glider has attained low corner position,  the pilot momentarily maintains this position. The pilot  releases the rudder pressure and, using coordinated flight  controls, slightly banks the glider to fly along the bottom side  of the box until reaching the original center low tow position.  

From center low tow position, the pilot maneuvers the glider  through the wake to the center high tow position, completing  the maneuver.  

Common errors when boxing the wake include:  

•	 Performing an excessively large rectangle around the  wake.  Figure 7-12  has exaggerated positions and is  not to scale. •	 Improper control coordination and procedure. •	 Abrupt or rapid changes of position. • 	 Allowing or developing unnecessary slack during  position changes.  

# Ground Launch Takeoff Procedures  

When ground launching, it is essential to use a center of  gravity (CG) towhook that has an automatic back release  feature. This protects the glider if the pilot is unable to release  the towline during the launch. The failure of the tow release  could cause the glider to be pulled to the ground as it flies  over the launching vehicle or winch. Since the back release  feature of the towhook is so important, it should be tested  prior to every flight.  [Figure 7-13]  

# CG Hooks  

Some training and high-performance gliders have only  a CG towhook. CG towhooks are necessary for ground  launch operations so the glider is not pulled into the ground.  Attachment at the center of gravity allows the glider pilot to  have full control of the glider without undue influence from  the ground pull. Attachment of a ground launch towline to  the nose hook would tend to pull the glider into the ground  and would overload the horizontal stabilizer and elevator.  Conversely, depending on design, the CG hook may not  have sufficient movement to fully release an aerotow line  under pressure. If the hook only swings about  $90^{\circ}$   down, the  towline may stay hung on the gliders hook until the pressure  is released and slack allows the towline to simply fall off. It  may be located either ahead of the landing gear, in the landing  gear well, or the glider may utilize a bracket that attaches  outside on the fuselage near the cockpit.  

If the CG hook is in the landing gear well, retracting the gear  on tow interferes with the towline. Even if the glider has a  nose hook, retracting the gear on tow is not recommended until  the aircraft is safely airborne and an immediate or emergency  return is not necessary. Leaving the gear down allows the  glider pilot more time to assess the best landing options.  

A CG hook, as compared to a nose hook, makes a crosswind  takeoff more difficult since the glider can weathervane into  the wind more easily. In addition, a CG hook makes the glider  more susceptible to kiting on takeoff, especially if the CG  is near the aft limit. This can present a serious danger to the  towplane during the aerotow.  

# Signals Prelaunch Signals (Winch/Automobile)  

Prelaunch visual signals for a ground launch operation allow  the glider pilot, the wing runner, the safety officer, and the  

![](images/7214d948064687c8ce0ef563d34c4990f4f35678756660a9bf77cb8926aca5c6.jpg)  
Figure 7-13.  Testing the towhook.  

launch crew to communicate over considerable distances.  When launching with an automobile, the glider and launch  automobile may be 1,000 feet or more apart. When launching  with a winch, the glider may start the launch 4,000 feet or  more from the winch. Because of the great distances involved,  members of the ground launch crew use colored flags or  large paddles to enhance visibility, as shown in  Figure 7-14 . When complex information must be relayed over great  distances, visual  prelaunch signals can be augmented with  direct voice communications between crewmember stations.  Hard-wired ground telephones, two-way radios, or wireless  telephones can be used to communicate between stations,  adding protection against premature launch and facilitating  an aborted launch if an unsafe condition arises. The towline  should never be attached to the glider until the crew is  onboard and ready to launch.  

# Inflight Signals  

Since ground launches are of short duration, inflight signals  for ground launches are limited to signals to the winch  operator or ground vehicle driver to increase or decrease  speed.  [Figure 7-15]  

# Tow Speeds  

Proper ground launch tow speed is critical for a safe launch.  Figure 7-16  compares various takeoff profiles that result  when tow speeds vary above or below the correct speed.  

![](images/cf600b0768a73ca6ed8ec2050ae7aff427cccf772d7a6e8604722fa5066ec9c2.jpg)

Figure 7-16.  Ground launch tow speed.  

Each glider certificated for ground launch operations has a  placarded maximum ground launch tow speed. This speed  is normally the same for automobile or winch launches. The  glider pilot should fly the launch staying at or below this  speed to prevent structural damage to the glider during the  ground tow.  

# Automobile Launch  

Automobile launches today are very rare. During automobile  ground launches, the glider pilot and driver should have a  thorough understanding of the groundspeeds to be used prior  to any launch. Before the first launch, the pilot and vehicle  driver should determine the appropriate vehicle ground tow  speeds, considering the surface wind velocity, the glider speed  increase during launch, and the wind gradient encountered  during the climb. They should include a safety factor to avoid  exceeding this maximum vehicle ground tow speed.  

If a crosswind condition is present, the glider should be  positioned slightly downwind of the takeoff heading and  angled into the wind to help eliminate control problems until  sufficient airspeed is obtained. Due to the slow acceleration  of the glider during an automobile ground launch, the towline  should be laid out to allow the glider to obtain sufficient speed  for control while still in a headwind.  [Figure 7-17]  

The tow speed can be determined by using the following  calculations:  

1.	 Subtract the surface winds from the maximum  placarded ground launch tow speed for the particular  glider. 2.	 Subtract an additional five miles per hour (mph) for  the airspeed increase during the climb. 3.	 Subtract the estimated wind gradient increase  encountered during the climb.  

4.	 Subtract a 5 mph safety factor.  

Maximum ground launch tow speed..................... 75 mph 1. 	 Surface winds 10 mph. ................................. –10 mph 2. 	 Airspeed increase during climb 5 mph.......... –5 mph 3. 	 Estimated climb wind gradient 5 mph...........  $-5\;\mathrm{mph}$  4. 	 Safety factor of 5 mph. ...................................  $-5\;\mathrm{mph}$  Automobile tow speed. .......................................... 50 mph  

During winch launches, the winch operator applies full power  smoothly and rapidly until the glider reaches an angle of  $30^{\circ}$  above the horizon. At this point, the operator should start  to reduce the power until the glider is about  $60^{\circ}$   above the  horizon where approximately 20 percent power is needed.  As the glider reaches the  $70^{\circ}$   point above the horizon, power  is reduced to idle. The winch operator monitors the glider  continuously during the climb for any signals to increase or  decrease speed from the glider pilot.  [Figure 7-18]  

# Crosswind Takeoff and Climb  

The following are the main differences between crosswind  takeoffs and climb procedures and normal takeoff and climb  procedures:  

•	 During the takeoff roll, the glider tends to weathervane  into the wind. •	 After liftoff, the glider drifts toward the downwind  side of the runway. •	 In strong crosswinds there is a greater tendency for  the glider to drift downwind. •	 If space is available in the takeoff area, the towline  or cable should be laid out in a manner that the initial  takeoff roll is slightly into the wind to reduce the  crosswind component of the glider.  [Figure 7-19]  

![](images/7afa4c46ca7835426ee1c553a855edc0f3943c83a74b33ad3d86fdc3ec949516.jpg)  
Figure 7-17.  Ground launch procedures.  

![](images/5dcd5a851dbb2cf1a994730999e887ab4db364b08e2731e4892d8186895a1d39.jpg)  
Figure 7-18.  Winch procedures.  

After lift-off, the glider pilot should establish a wind  correction angle toward the upwind side of the runway to  prevent drifting downwind. This prevents downwind drift  and allows the glider to work upwind of the runway during  the climb-out. When the towline is released at the top of the  climb, it tends to drift back toward the centerline of the launch  runway, as shown in  Figure 7-20 . This helps keep the towline  from fouling nearby wires, poles, fences, aircraft, and other  obstacles on the side of the launching runway. Should the  glider drift to the downwind side of the runway, the towline  could damage other aircraft, runway lights, nearby fences,  structures, obstacles, etc.  

# Normal Into-the-Wind Launch  

Normal takeoffs are made into the wind. Prior to launch, the  glider pilot, ground crew, and launch equipment operator  must be familiar with the launch signals and procedures.  When the required checklists for the glider and ground  launch equipment have been completed and the glider  pilot, ground crew, and launch equipment operator are  ready for takeoff, the glider pilot should signal the ground  crewmember to hook the towline to the glider. The hookup  must be done deliberately and correctly. The release  mechanism should be checked for proper operation. To  accomplish this, the ground crewmember should apply  tension to the towline and signal the glider pilot to activate  the release. The ground crewmember should verify that  the release has worked properly and signal the glider  pilot. When the towline is hooked up to the glider again,  the ground crewmember takes a position at the wingtip of  the down wing. When the glider pilot signals “ready for  takeoff,” the ground crewmember clears both takeoff and  landing areas. When the ground crewmember has ensured  the traffic pattern is clear, the ground crewmember then  

![](images/18a68103edbd5f569f0269aade540925d045daf39ab1716944a876dfb7806f42.jpg)  
Figure 7-19.  Wind correction angle for winch procedures.  

signals the launch equipment operator to “take up slack”  in the towline. Once the slack is removed from the towline,  the ground crewmember again verifies that the glider pilot  is ready for takeoff. Then, the ground crewmember raises  the wings to a level position, does a final traffic pattern  check, and signals to the launch equipment operator to  begin the takeoff.  

CAUTION: Never connect a glider to a towplane or towline  unless the pilot is aboard and ready for flight. If the pilot exits  the glider for any reason, the towline should be released and  disconnected. Glider pilots should be prepared for a takeoff  anytime the towline is attached to the glider.  

The length, elasticity, and mass of the towline used for ground  launching have several effects on the glider being launched.  First, it is difficult or impossible to prevent the glider from  

![](images/2043941337e878c0625d4e8d86a7450f6d6f8ef1ecc603cd2476d39ebd03da24.jpg)  
Figure 7-20.  Ground launch crosswind drift correction.  

moving forward as the long towline is tautened. Elasticity in  the towline causes the glider to creep forward as the towline  is tightened. For this reason, the towline is left with a small  amount of slack prior to beginning the launch. It is important  for the pilot to be prepared for the launch prior to giving the  launch signal. If the launch is begun before the pilot gives the  launch signal, the glider pilot should pull the towline release  handle promptly. In the first several seconds of the launch,  the glider pilot should hold the stick forward to avoid kiting.  During the launch, the glider pilot should track the runway  centerline and monitor the airspeed.  [Figure 7-21, position A]  

When the glider accelerates and attains lift-off speed, the  glider pilot eases the glider off the ground. The time interval  from standing start to lift-off may be as short as 3 to 5 seconds.  After the initial lift-off, the pilot should smoothly raise the  nose to the proper pitch attitude, watching for an increase in  airspeed. If the nose is raised too soon or too steeply, the pitch  attitude is excessive while the glider is still at low altitude. If  the towline breaks or the launching mechanism loses power,  recovery from such a high pitch attitude may be difficult  or impossible. Conversely, if the nose is raised too slowly,  the glider may gain excessive airspeed and may exceed the  maximum ground launch tow speed. The shallow climb may  result in the glider not attaining planned release altitude. If  this situation occurs, the pilot should pull the release and land  straight ahead, avoiding any obstacles and equipment.  

As the launch progresses, the pilot should ease the nose up  gradually  [Figure 7-21, position   $B J$   while monitoring the  airspeed to ensure that it is adequate for launch but does  not exceed the maximum permitted ground launch tow  airspeed. When optimum pitch attitude for climb is attained,  [Figure 7-21, position  $C J$    the glider should be approximately  200 feet AGL. The pilot must monitor the airspeed during  this phase of the climb-out to ensure the airspeed is adequate  to provide a safe margin above stall speed but below the  maximum ground launch airspeed. If the towline breaks,  or if the launching mechanism loses power at or above this  altitude, the pilot has sufficient altitude to release the towline  and lower the nose from the climb attitude to the approach  attitude that provides an appropriate airspeed for landing  straight ahead.  

As the glider nears its maximum altitude  [Figure 7-21,  position  $D J$  , it begins to level off above the launch winch or  tow vehicle to reduce the rate of climb. In this final phase of  the ground launch, the towline is pulling steeply down on the  glider. The pilot should gently lower the nose of the glider  to reduce tension on the towline and then pull the towline  release two to three times to ensure the towline releases. The  pilot feels the release of the towline as it departs the glider.  The pilot should enter a turn to visually confirm the fall of  the towline. If only a portion of the towline is seen falling  to the ground, it is possible that the towline is broken and a  portion of the towline is still attached to the glider.  

If pulling the tow release handle fails to release the towline,  the back release mechanism of the towhook should  automatically release the towline as the glider overtakes and  passes the launch vehicle or winch.  

# Climb-Out and Release Procedures  

The pitch attitude/airspeed relationship during ground launch  is a unique flight experience. During the launch, pulling  back on the stick tends to increase airspeed, and pushing  forward tends to reduce airspeed. This is opposite of the  

![](images/e419c761be8009bce586f7f2a24c223e3ebcc740a90823397da28b55d4afe27d.jpg)  
Figure 7-21.  Ground launch takeoff profile.  

normal pitch/airspeed relationship. The wings of the glider  divert the towing force of the launch vehicle in an upward  direction, enabling rapid climb. The greater the diversion  is from horizontal pulling power to vertical lifting power,  the faster the airspeed is. This is true if the tow vehicle is  powerful enough to meet the energy demands the glider is  making on the launch system.  

Common errors in ground launching include:  

•	 Improper glider configuration for takeoff. •	 Improper initial positioning of flight controls. •	 Improper use of visual launch signals. •	 Improper crosswind procedure. •	 Improper climb profile. •	 Faulty corrective action for adjustment of airspeed  and pitch. •	 Exceeding maximum launch airspeed. •	 Improper towline release procedure.  

# Self-Launch Takeoff Procedures Preparation and Engine Start  

The self-launching glider  [Figure 7-22]  has many more  systems than a nonmotorized glider, so glider preflight  inspection is more complex. A positive control check is  just as critical as it is with any aircraft. Ailerons, elevator,  rudder, elevator trim tab, flaps, and spoiler/dive brakes must  all be checked. In addition, numerous other systems must  be inspected and readied for flight. These include the fuel  system, electrical system, engine, propeller, cooling system,  and any mechanisms and controls associated with extending  or retracting the engine or propulsion system. Instruments,  gauges, and all engine and propulsion system controls must  be inspected for proper operation.  

After preflighting the self-launching glider and clearing the  area, start the engine in accordance with the manufacturer’s  instructions. Hearing protection may be needed and is  advisable when using combustion engines in self-launching  or sustaining gliders. Typical items on a self-launching glider  engine-start checklist include fuel mixture control, fuel tank  

![](images/39b26313b81ecc43bb20f7c3f282c992586d0009c9088ef0c7b8860ac4a019cb.jpg)  
Figure 7-22.  Types of self-launching gliders.  

selection, fuel pump switch, engine priming, propeller pitch  setting, throttle setting, magneto or ignition switch setting,  and electric starter activation. After starting, the oil pressure,  oil temp, alternator/generator charging, and flight instruments  should be checked. If the engine and propulsion systems are  operating within normal limits, taxi operations can begin.  These types of gliders often feature a retractable powerplant  for drag reduction. After the launch, the powerplant is  retracted into the fuselage and stowed.  

Common errors in preparation and engine start include:  

•	 Failure to use or improper use of checklist. •	 Improper or unsafe starting procedures. •	 Excessively high revolutions per minutes (rpm)  after starting. •	 Failure to ensure proper clearance of propeller.  

# Taxiing  

Self-launching gliders are designed with a variety of landing  gear systems, including tricycle or tailwheel landing gear  configurations. Other types of self-launching gliders rest  primarily on the main landing gear wheel in the center of the  fuselage and depend on outrigger wheels or skids to prevent  the wingtips from contacting the ground.  

Due to the long wingspan and low wingtip ground clearance  of gliders, the self-launching glider pilot needs to consider  airport layout and runway configuration. Some taxiways  and airport ramps may not accommodate the long wingspan  of the glider or limit maneuvering. Additionally, the pilot  must consider the glider’s crosswind capability during taxi  operations. Taxiing on soft ground requires additional power.  Self-launching gliders with outrigger wingtip wheels may  lose directional control if a wingtip wheel bogs down. Well- briefed wing walkers should hold the wings level during  low-speed taxi operations on soft ground.  

Common errors in taxiing a self-launching glider include:  

•	 Improper use of brakes. •	 Failure to comply with airport markings, signals, and  clearances. •	 Taxiing too fast for conditions. •	 Improper control positioning for wind conditions. •	 Failure to consider wingspan and space required to  maneuver during taxiing.  

# Pretakeoff Check  

The manufacturer provides a takeoff checklist. As shown in  Figure 7-23 , the complexity of many self-launching gliders  makes a written takeoff checklist an essential safety item.  Pretakeoff items on a self-launching glider may include fuel  quantity check, fuel pressure check, oil temperature check, oil  pressure check, engine runup, throttle/rpm check, propeller  pitch setting, cowl flap setting, and vacuum check. Other  items that also must be completed include ensuring seat  belts and shoulder harnesses are latched or secured, doors  and windows are closed and locked, canopies are closed and  locked, air brakes are closed and locked, altimeter is set,  communication radio set to the proper frequency for traffic  advisory, and flight instruments are adjusted for takeoff.  

Common errors in the before takeoff check include:  

•	 Improper positioning of the self-launching glider for  runup. •	 Failure to use or improper use of checklist. •	 Improper check of flight controls. •	 Failure to review takeoff emergency procedures. •	 Improper radio and communications procedures.  

![](images/f7943b7c430d24edc47dd0efbd34283b05016f73557ab45bea2587b943a87d75.jpg)  
Figure 7-23.  Self-launching glider instrument panels.  

# Normal Takeoff  

When the pretakeoff checklist is complete, the pilot should  check for traffic and prepare for takeoff. If operating from  an airport with an operating control tower, request and  receive an air traffic control (ATC) clearance prior to taxi.  The pilot should make a final check for conflicting traffic,  then taxi out onto the active runway and align the glider  with the centerline.  

The pilot should smoothly apply full throttle and begin  the takeoff roll while tracking the centerline of the runway  and then fly the self-launching glider off the runway at  the recommended lift-off airspeed, allowing the glider  to accelerate in ground effect (IGE) until reaching the  appropriate climb airspeed. If the runway has an obstacle  ahead, the preferred airspeed is best angle of climb airspeed   $\mathrm{(V_{X})}$   until the obstacle is cleared. If no obstacle is present, the  preferred airspeed is either best rate of climb airspeed   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   or  the airspeed for best engine cooling during climb. The pilot  should monitor the engine and instrument systems during  climb-out. If the self-launching glider has a time limitation  on full throttle operation, the throttle should be adjusted as  necessary during the climb.  

# Crosswind Takeoff  

The long wingspan and low wingtip clearance of the typical  self-launching glider make it vulnerable to wingtip strikes  on runway signage and airport runway and taxiway lights.  The takeoff roll should be started with the upwind wing on  the ground with the aileron and rudder controls coordinated  for the pilots current wind situation. For example, in a right  crosswind, the control stick should be held to the right  and the rudder held to the left. The aileron input keeps the  crosswind from lifting the upwind wing, and the downwind  rudder minimizes the weathervaning tendency of the self- launching glider in a crosswind. As airspeed increases,  control effectiveness improves and the pilot can gradually  decrease the control setting to coordinated flight. The self- launching glider should be lifted off at the appropriate lift-off  airspeed and accelerate to climb airspeed. During the climb,  a wind correction angle should be established so that the  self-launching glider tracks the extended centerline of the  takeoff runway.  [Figure 7-24]  

Common errors in crosswind takeoff include:  

•	 Improper initial positioning of flight controls. •	 Improper power application. •	 Inappropriate removal of hand from throttle. •	 Poor directional control. •	 Improper use of flight controls. •	 Improper pitch attitude during takeoff.  

![](images/ed221bb1623910ed8f0238e014528201257c0af04a02077d2c54752b67d83f6b.jpg)

•	 Failure to establish and maintain proper climb attitude  and airspeed. •	 Maintaining takeoff slip instead of transitioning to  crab to achieve more climb efficiency.  

# Climb-Out and Shutdown Procedures  

Self-launching gliders have powerplant limitations, as  well as aircraft performance and handling limitations.  Powerplant limitations include engine and oil temperatures,  engine rpm limits, and other engine/aircraft limitations  listed in the GFM/POH.  

The GFM or POH provides useful information about  recommended power settings and target airspeed for best  angle of climb, best rate of climb, best cooling performance  climb, and cruise performance while in powered flight.  If full throttle operation is time limited to reduce engine  wear, the GFM/POH describes the recommended operating  procedures. Aircraft performance includes weight and  balance limits, minimum and maximum front seat weight  restrictions, maximum permitted airspeed with engine  extended, maximum airspeed to extend or retract the engine,  flap operating airspeed range, air brake operating airspeed  range, maneuvering speed, rough air speed limitations, and  never-exceed speed.  

The engine heats up considerably during takeoff and climb,  so cooling system mismanagement can lead to dangerously  high temperatures in a short time. An overheated engine  cannot supply full power, meaning climb performance is  reduced. Extended overheating can cause an inflight fire.  To minimize the chances of engine damage or fire, monitor  engine temperatures carefully during high power operations,  observing engine operating limitations described in the  GFM/POH.  

Many self-launching gliders have a time limitation on full  throttle operation to prevent overheating and premature  engine wear. If the self-launching glider is equipped with  cowl flaps for cooling, make certain the cowl flaps are set  properly for high power operations. In some self-launching  gliders, operating at full power with cowl flaps closed can  result in overheating and damage to the engine in as little as 2  minutes. If abnormally high engine system temperatures are  encountered, follow the procedures described in the GFM/ POH. Typically, these require reduced power with higher  airspeed to enhance engine cooling. Cowl flap instructions  may be provided as well. If these measures are ineffective  in reducing high temperatures, the safest course of action  may be to shut down the engine and make a precautionary  landing. A safe landing, whether on or off the airport, is  always preferable to an inflight fire.  

Handling limitations for a given self-launching glider may be  quite subtle and may include minimum controllable airspeed  with power on, minimum controllable airspeed with power  off, and other limitations described in the GFM/POH. Self- launching gliders come in many configurations. Those with a  top-mounted retractable engine and/or propeller have a thrust  line that is quite distant from the longitudinal axis of the  glider. The result is that significant changes of power settings  tend to cause substantial pitch attitude changes. For instance,  full power setting in these self-launching gliders introduces a  nose-down pitching moment because the engine thrust line is  high above the longitudinal axis of the glider. To counteract  this pitching moment, the pilot holds the control stick back  pressure and trim. If power is quickly reduced from full power  to idle power while holding an control up stick force, the  glider tends to pitch up with the power reduction. This nose- pitching moment may be vigorous enough to induce aircraft  stall. Smooth and coordinated management of power and flight  control provides the safest procedure under these conditions.  

During climb-out, the pilot should hold a pitch attitude that  results in climbing out at the desired airspeed, adjusting  elevator trim as necessary. As previously stated, climbs in  self-launching gliders are best managed with smooth control  inputs; when power changes are necessary, make smooth and  gradual throttle adjustments.  

When climbing under power, most self-launching gliders  exhibit a left or right turning tendency (depending on whether  the propeller is turning clockwise or counterclockwise) due  to P-factor. P-factor is caused by the uneven distribution of  thrust caused by the difference in the angle of attack (AOA) of the ascending propeller blade and the descending propeller  blade. Use the rudder to counteract P-factor during climbs  with power.  [Figure 7-25]  

![](images/6c37ea39d5e4b8a680887397b30b00a0842951e664b8fcc733f6240945cb7178.jpg)

Turns are accomplished with a shallow bank angle because  steep banks result in a greatly reduced rate of climb. As with  all turns, properly coordinated aileron and rudder movement  result in a more efficient flight and faster climb rate. The pilot  should scan for other aircraft traffic before making any turn. Detailed engine shutdown procedures are described in the  GFM/POH. A guide to shutdown procedures is described  below, but the GFM/POH is the authoritative source for any  self-launching glider.  

Engines reach high operating temperatures during extended  high-power operations. To reduce or eliminate shock cooling  caused by a sudden reduction of engine power setting, reduce  power slowly. Shock cooling is generally considered to be the  outside components of an engine cooling much faster than  the truly hot parts inside the engine not directly exposed to  cooling airflow. This shock cooling allows the external parts  to cool faster and shrink more than the interior components  resulting in binding and scuffing of moving parts such as  piston rings and valves.  

To reduce the possibility of inflight fire, the manufacturer  provides engine cool-down procedures for reducing engine  system temperatures prior to shutdown. Reducing throttle  setting allows the engine to begin a gradual cool down. The  GFM/POH may also instruct the pilot to adjust propeller pitch  at this time. Lowering the nose to increase airspeed provides  faster flow of cooling air to the engine cooling system.  Several minutes of reduced throttle and increased cooling  airflow are enough to allow the engine to be shut down.  

If the engine is retractable, additional time after engine  shutdown may be necessary to reduce engine temperature to  acceptable limits prior to retracting and stowing the engine in  the fuselage. Consult the GFM/POH for details.  [Figure 7-22]  

Retractable-engine self-launching gliders are aerodynamically  more efficient when the engine is stowed, but produce high  drag when the engine is extended and not providing thrust.  Stowing the engine is critical to efficient soaring flight. Prior  to stowing, the propeller must be aligned with the longitudinal  axis of the glider, so the propeller blades do not interfere with  the engine bay doors.  

Since the engine/propeller installation in these gliders is aft of  the pilot’s head, these gliders usually have a mirror, enabling  the pilot to perform a visual propeller alignment check prior  to stowing the engine/propeller pod. Detailed instructions for  stowing the engine and propeller are found in the GFM/POH  for the particular glider. If a malfunction occurs during engine  shutdown and stowage, the pilot cannot count on being able to get  the engine restarted. The pilot should have a landing area within  power-off gliding distance in anticipation of this eventuality.  

Some self-launching gliders use a nose-mounted engine/ propeller installation that resembles the typical installation  found on single-engine airplanes. In these self-launching  gliders, the shutdown procedure usually consists of operating  the engine for a short time at reduced power to cool the engine  down to acceptable shutdown temperature. After shutdown,  the cowl flaps (if installed) should be closed to reduce drag  and increase gliding efficiency. The manufacturer may  recommend a time interval between engine shutdown and cowl  flap closure to prevent excess temperatures from developing  in the confined, tightly cowled engine compartment. These  temperatures may not be harmful to the engine itself, but may  degrade the structures around the engine, such as composite  engine mounts or installed electrical components. Excess  engine heat may result in fuel vapor lock.  

If the propeller blade pitch can be controlled by the pilot  while in flight, the propeller is usually set to coarse pitch.  Some installations have a propeller feathering system that  reduces propeller drag to a minimum for use during non- powered flight. Some self-launching gliders require the pilot  to set the propeller to coarse pitch prior to engine shutdown.  Other self-launching gliders require the pilot to shut down  the engine first and then adjust propeller blade pitch to coarse  pitch or setting to a feathered position. As always, pilots must  follow the recommended shutdown procedures described in  their GFM/POH.  

Common errors during climb-out and shutdown procedures  include:  

•	 Failure to follow manufacturer’s recommended  procedure for engine shutdown, feathering, and  stowing (if applicable). •	 Failure to maintain positive aircraft control while  performing engine shutdown procedures. •	 Failure to follow proper engine extension and restart  procedures.  

# Landing  

If the self-launching glider is to land under power, the pilot  should perform the engine restart procedures at an altitude  that allows time to reconfigure. The pilot should follow the  manufacturer’s recommended engine start checklist. Once  the engine is started, the pilot should allow time for it to  warm up. After the engine is started, the pilot should ensure  that all systems necessary for landing are operational, such  as the electrical system and landing gear.  

Caution: Follow the manufacturer’s recommended engine  extension and restart procedures or a loss of situational  awareness could result in attempting a landing with the glider  a high drag configuration. The pilot of a sustainer or self- launching glider should plan for the engines to fail to start  and not have sufficient power to retract the engine and exhibit  a much higher drag coefficient. Should the engine not start  and retract, a glider pilot should have an alternate landing  area available with the decreased performance available in  the higher drag configuration.  

The pilot should fly the traffic pattern to land into the wind  and plan the approach path to avoid all obstacles. The landing  area should be of sufficient length to allow for touchdown  and roll-out within the performance limitations of the  particular self-launching glider. The pilot should also take  into consideration any crosswind conditions and the landing  surface. After touchdown, the pilot should maintain direction  control and slow the self-launching glider to clear the landing  area. The after-landing checklist should be completed when  appropriate.  

Common errors during landing include:  

•	 Poor judgment of approach path. •	 Improper use of flaps, spoilers, and/or dive brakes. •	 Improper approach and landing speed. •	 Improper crosswind correction. •	 Improper technique during flare and touchdown. •	 Poor directional control after landing. •	 Improper use of brakes. •	 Failure to use the appropriate checklist. •	 Failure to use proper radio communication procedures.  

# Gliderport/Airport Traffic Patterns and  Operations  

The pilot must be familiar with the approach and landing  traffic pattern to a gliderport or airport because the  approach actually starts some distance away. Gliderports  and airport operators should comply with Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) recommended procedures established  in Advisory Circulars (AC), the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM), and current FAA regulations for operating  in United States airspace. If glider operation is conducted in  other countries, the air regulations for those countries would  apply. These publications also serve as good references to  ensure safe glider operations.  

Pilots need to determine a proper visual reference point as  an initial point (IP) from which to begin the approach for  each landing area. The IP may be located over the center  of the gliderport/airport or at a remote location near the  traffic pattern. As shown in  Figure 7-26,  the sequence of a  normal approach is from over the IP to the downwind leg,  base leg, final approach, flare, touchdown, rollout, and stop.  Some gliderports and airports have established procedures  to follow when conducting flight operations in and out of  their airfield. It is good pilot practice to review existing  approach and departure procedures so as to always follow  safe established procedures. Be aware that compensation for  winds often requires modifying the traffic pattern to retain  a safe approach angle.  

Determining the IP comes with good training and experience.  The IP should only be used as a visual reference point for  proper positioning into the traffic pattern. Do not rely on  these visual points, as when landing at a different gliderport/ airports these points will change. Pilots should develop  proper placement, altitude, and distances based on current  conditions. Use proper alignment for winds and always  consider other environmental factors. Flying the glider traffic  pattern is basically the same as a power pattern; however,  the glider pilot must consider other environmental factors  that affect the landing.  

Once over the IP, the pilot flies along the downwind leg of the  planned landing pattern. The pilot should plan to be over the  IP at an altitude of 800 to 1,000 feet AGL or as recommended  by the local field operating procedures. During this time, it  is important to look for other aircraft and, if installed, listen  to the radio for other aircraft in the vicinity of the gliderport/ airport. Glider pilots should plan to make any radio calls  early in the pattern, so the pilot can concentrate and on the  landing task without being distracted. Glider pilots should  be aware of other activities located at the gliderport/airport,  and it is important that they are familiar with good operating  practices. Glider operations usually establish the patterns for  their operation with other activities in mind. Pilots new to a  gliderport/airport should obtain a thorough checkout before  conducting any flights.  

Pilots should complete the landing checklist prior to the  downwind leg. A good landing checklist is known as  FUSTALL. This checklist can be modified as necessary for  any glider.  

•	 F laps—set (if applicable) •	 U ndercarriage—down and locked (if applicable) •	 S peed—normal approach speed established (as  recommended by the GFM/POH) •	 T rim—set •	 A ir brakes (spoilers/dive brakes)—checked for correct  operation •	 L anding area—look for wind, other aircraft, and  personnel •	 L and the glider  

# Normal Approach and Landing  

Prior to entering the downwind leg and accomplishing the  landing checklist, concentrate on judging the approach angle,  distance from the landing area, and staying clear of other  aircraft while monitoring approach airspeed. The normal  approach speed, as recommended by the GFM/POH, is the  speed for ideal flight conditions. Medium turns can be used  in the traffic pattern, but do not exceed a   $45^{\circ}$   bank angle.  The approach should be made using spoilers/dive brakes as  necessary to dissipate excess altitude. Use the elevator to  

![](images/37b00b69479c0a5d1d1ef99f1234ebc7521fb5a444c68f03a84aa3b5955e0fd4.jpg)  
Figure 7-26.  Traffic pattern.  

maintain the recommended approach airspeed established by  the manufacturer. If no approach speed is recommended by  the manufacturer, use   $1.5\;\mathrm{V_{SO}}$  . Establishing a proper pattern  entry and normal approach speed is a foundation for a good  approach to landing. During the entry into the traffic pattern,  pilots need to ensure that the glider is in trim and keep the  yaw string straight during these turns while maneuvering in  the traffic pattern at all times.  

Strong crosswinds, tailwinds, or high sink rates that are  encountered in the traffic pattern require the pilot to modify  the individual pattern leg (downwind, base, or final) and to  adjust the approach speed as appropriate. It is recommended  that half of the gust factor be added to the normal approach  speed to compensate for wind gusts and sink. A strong  tailwind or headwind requires a respective shortening or  lengthening of the leg. A sudden encounter with a high sink  rate may require the pilot to turn toward the landing area  sooner than normal. The pilot should not conduct a  $360^{\circ}$   turn  once established on the downwind leg. Throughout the traffic  pattern, the pilot should be constantly aware of the approach  speed and plan ahead by keeping the glider in trim and the  yaw string straight.  

When at an appropriate distance from the IP, the pilot should  maneuver the glider to enter the downwind leg. The distance  for a normal pattern from downwind leg to the landing area  should be approximately one quarter to one half of a mile.  Of course, this depends on current conditions and the type of  glider. This varies at different locations. On the downwind  leg, the glider should descend to arrive abeam the touchdown  point at an altitude between 500 and 600 feet AGL. On the  downwind leg, the groundspeed is higher if a tailwind is  present. The pilot should use the spoilers/dive brakes as  necessary to arrive at this altitude. The pilot should also  monitor the glider’s position with reference to the touchdown  area. If the wind pushes the glider away from or toward the  touchdown area, the pilot should stop the drift by establishing  a wind correction angle into the wind. Failure to do so affects  the point where the base leg should be started.  

The base leg should not be started any later than when  the touchdown point is approximately   $45^{\circ}$   over the pilot’s  shoulder looking back at the touchdown area, under a no-wind  condition. Newer, higher glide ratio, faster gliders may need  to extend the downwind leg somewhat, whereas lower ratio,  slower gliders may need to turn to the base leg much sooner.  Each glider pilot must determine the landing conditions and  configure the glider for that landing under those conditions.  Slip and drag devices can dissipate excess altitude, but  nothing on a glider can make up for insufficient altitude to  glide to the landing area. Base altitude should be no lower  than approximately 500 feet AGL.  

Once established on the base leg, the pilot should scan the  extended final approach path to detect any aircraft that might  be on long final approach to the landing area in use. If a radio  is installed in the glider, this would be a good time to broadcast  position for turn to final. The turn to the base leg should be  timely enough to keep the point of intended touchdown area  within easy gliding range. The pilot should adjust the turn  to correct for wind drift encountered on the base leg and, if  needed, make correction turns to ensure maintainance of the  proper glide angle to the landing area. The pilot should also  adjust the spoilers/dive brakes, as necessary, to position the  glider at the desired glide angle.  

NOTE: New pilots should learn to properly scan for another  aircraft operating in the traffic pattern. Pilots should also  review FAA AC 90-48C, Pilot’s Role in Collision Avoidance.  

The turn onto the final approach should not exceed a   $45^{\circ}$  bank and the glider should be on the appropriate approach  angle to start the descent. The pilot should ensure that the  yaw string is straight. Complete the turn to final to line up  with the centerline of the touchdown area. The pilot should  adjust the spoilers/dive brakes, as necessary, to fly the desired  approach angle to the aim point and establish a stabilized  approach at the recommended approach speed.  

The stabilized approach is when the glider is at the proper  glider path/angle with minimal spoilers/dive brakes deployed/ extended, at the recommended approach speed for the current  conditions (winds, gust, sink, etc.) and able to make the  intended landing spot. The stabilized approach should be  established no lower than 100 feet AGL. The final approach  with spoilers/dive brakes extended approximately half open  (not half travel of the spoiler/dive brake control handle) is ideal  for most gliders. Avoid using full spoilers/dive brakes because  this use causes a higher descent rate and increase in stall speed.  

Minor adjustments in the spoilers/dive brakes may be  needed to ensure proper glidepath control. Avoid pumping  the spoilers/dive brakes from full open to full close. Under  some conditions, the spoilers/dive brakes may have to be  closed momentarily to correct the glidepath. The selected  aim point should be prior to the touchdown point to  accommodate the landing flare. The pilot may flare the  glider at or about three to five feet AGL. The glider may  float some distance until it touches down. If excess speed is  used, the glider floats a considerable distance. Avoid using  this technique as it uses a large amount of the intended  landing area. Do not try to force the glider onto the ground  at excessive speeds. This may introduce oscillations, such  as porpoising and overcontrolling.  

When within three to five feet of the landing surface, begin  the flare with slight back elevator. As the airspeed decreases,  the pilot holds the glider in a level or tail-low attitude  to touchdown at the lowest possible speed for existing  conditions, while the glider is still under aerodynamic control.  

Pilots should avoid driving the glider into the ground by little  or no flare. This type of landing puts excessive loads on the  landing gear and wings. The pilot should hold the glider  off as possible, but ensuring the touchdown is on the main  wheel as stated in the GFM. In some gliders, the pilot can  increase pitch attitude with slight back pressure to dissipate  as much energy as possible prior to touchdown. The pilot  should ensure that the glider touches down with a nose-high  attitude, but not high enough to land tail first. A good glider  landing in most gliders with a main wheel and tail wheel, or  skid, is on the main wheel with the tail wheel just slightly  touching or the tail wheel just barely off the surface. The  main wheel is designed to withstand the shock of landings but  the tail wheel is not. In some instances, the attach points or  structure just in front of the empennage is the weakest point  and may fail first. Pilots should always follow the GFM/POH  recommendations of the manufacturer.  

After touchdown, the pilot should concentrate on rolling  out straight along the the centerline of the touchdown area,  keeping full back stick on the elevator and the glider wings  level. If an obstacle is detected (possible in an off-airport  landing or landing out), a coordinated turn on the ground  is needed to avoid the obstacle. Ensure that a wing is not  allowed to contact the ground until the glider is at its lowest  speed or stopped.  

Tracking along a centerline of the touchdown area is an  important consideration in gliders. The long, low wingtips  of the glider are susceptible to damage from runway signage  and runway lighting. Turning off the runway should be done  only if and when the pilot has the glider under control.  

Landing in high, gusty winds or turbulent conditions may  require higher approach airspeed to improve controllability  and provide a safer margin above stall airspeed. As a rule  of thumb, pilots add one-half the reported gust factor to the  normal recommended approach airspeed. This increased  approach airspeed provides a safety margin and affords better  penetration into the headwind on final approach.  

# Crosswind Landing  

Crosswind landings require a crabbing, or slipping method,  to correct for the effects of the wind on the final approach.  Additionally, the pilot must land the glider without placing  any unnecessary side load on the landing gear.  

The crab method requires the pilot to point the nose of  the glider into the wind and fly a straight track along the  desired groundpath. The stronger the wind is, the greater  the crab angle needs to be. The glider is in coordinated flight  and tracking the extended centerline of the landing area.  [Figure 7-27A]  Prior to flare, the pilot must be prepared to  align the glider with the landing direction.  [Figure 7-27B]   The pilot should use the rudder to align the glider prior to  touchdown and deflect the ailerons into the wind to control  the side drift caused by the crosswind.  

In the slip method, the pilot uses rudder and ailerons to slip  the glider into the wind to prevent drifting downwind of  the touchdown area. The disadvantage of the slip method is  that the sink rate of the glider increases, forcing the pilot to  adjust the spoilers/dive brakes, as necessary, to compensate  for this additional sink rate. Glider pilots should be ready to  apply brakes to avoid leaving the runway or landing area as  control authority is lost. The slip should be established no  lower than 100 feet to ensure a stable approach.  

Pilot selection of the slip or crab method for crosswind  landing is personal preference and/or related to glider size and  wingspan. The important action is to stabilize the approach  early enough on final to maintain a constant approach angle  and airspeed to arrive at the selected touchdown point.  

Common errors during approach and landing include:  

•	 Improper glidepath control. •	 Improper use of flaps, spoilers/dive brakes. •	 Improper airspeed control.  •	 Improper stabilize approach. •	 Improper correction for crosswind. •	 Improper procedure for touchdown/landing. •	 Poor directional control during/after landing. •	 Improper use of wheel brakes.  

# Slips  

A slip is a descent with one wing lowered. It may be used  for either of two purposes or both of them combined. A slip  may be used to steepen the approach path without increasing  the airspeed, as would be the case if the spoilers/dive brakes  were inoperative, or to clear an obstacle. It can also be  used to make the glider move sideways through the air to  counteract the drift that results from a crosswind. Formerly,  slips were used as a normal means of controlling landing  descents to short or obstructed fields, but they are now  primarily used in the performance of crosswind landings  and short/off-field landings.  

With the installation of effective spoilers/dive brakes on  modern gliders, the use of slips to steepen or control the  angle of descent is no longer the only procedure available  

![](images/ef0f4b0502c791d68190825f8733a02528c79b3925fae674c576b233afac1e66.jpg)

to the glider pilot. However, the pilot still needs proficiency  in performance of forward slips to correct for possible errors  in judgment of the landing approach.  

The forward slip is a slip in which the glider’s direction of  motion remains the same as before the slip was begun. If there  is any crosswind, the slip is much more effective if made into  the wind. If the glider is originally in straight flight, the wing  on the side that the slip is to be made should be lowered by  using the ailerons. Simultaneously, the glider’s nose must  be yawed in the opposite direction by applying opposite  rudder so the glider’s longitudinal axis is at an angle to its  original flightpath. The degree to which the nose is yawed in  the opposite direction from the bank should be such that the  original ground track is maintained. The nose should also be  raised as necessary to prevent the airspeed from increasing.  

The primary purpose of forward slips is to dissipate altitude  without increasing the glider’s airspeed, particularly in  gliders not equipped with flaps or those with inoperative  spoilers/dive brakes. There are many circumstances requiring  the use of forward slips, such as in a landing approach over  obstacles and in making off-field landings. It is always wise  to allow an extra margin of altitude for safety in the original  estimate of the approach. In the latter case, if the inaccuracy  of the approach is confirmed by excess altitude when nearing  the boundary of the selected field, slipping may dissipate the  excess altitude.  

The use of slips has definite limitations. Some pilots may try  to lose altitude by violent slipping rather than by smoothly  maneuvering, exercising good judgment, and using only  a slight or moderate slip. In off-field landings, this erratic  practice invariably leads to trouble since enough excess  speed may result in preventing touchdown anywhere near  the touchdown point, and very often results in overshooting  the entire field.  

A sideslip, as distinguished from a forward slip, is one  during which the glider’s longitudinal axis remains parallel  to the original flightpath, but in which the flightpath  changes direction according to the steepness of the bank.  [Figure 7-28]  The sideslip is important in counteracting  wind drift during crosswind landings and is discussed in the  crosswind landing section of this chapter.  

Sideslip is used during the last portion of a final approach.  The longitudinal axis of the glider must be aligned with the  runway just prior to touchdown so the glider touches down  in the direction in which it is moving. This requires timely  action to decrease the slip to maintain ground track alignment  with the landing zone. Failure to accomplish this alignment  imposes severe sideloads on the landing gear and imparts  violent ground looping tendencies.  

Decreasing the slip is accomplished by leveling the wings  and simultaneously releasing the rudder pressure while  readjusting the pitch attitude to the normal glide attitude.  If the pressure on the rudder is released abruptly, the nose  swings too quickly into line and the glider tends to acquire  excess airspeed.  

Because of the location of the pitot tube and static vents,  airspeed indicators in some gliders may have considerable  error when the glider is in a slip. The pilot must be aware of  this possibility and recognize a properly performed slip by  the attitude of the glider, the sound of the airflow, and the  feel of the flight controls.  

Common errors when performing a slip include:  

•	 Improper glidepath control. •	 Improper use of slips. •	 Improper airspeed control. •	 Improper correction for crosswind.

•	 Improper procedure for touchdown/landing. •	 Poor directional control during/after landing. •	 Improper use of spoilers, air brakes or dive brakes.  

# Downwind Landing  

Downwind landings present special hazards and should  be avoided when an into-the-wind landing is available.  However, factors like gliderport/airport design, obstacles,  or high terrain at one end of the runway, and runway slope  may dictate a downwind procedure takeoff and landing  procedures. Emergencies or a launch failure at low altitude  can also require a downwind landing. The pilot must use the  normal approach airspeed during a downwind landing. Any  airspeed in excess only causes the approach area and runway  needed for approach and landing to increase.  

A tailwind increases the touchdown groundspeed and  lengthens the landing roll. The increased distance for landing  can be determined by dividing the actual touchdown speed  by the normal touchdown speed, and squaring the result. For  example, if the tailwind is 10 knots and the normal touchdown  speed is 40 knots, the actual touchdown speed is 50 knots.  This touchdown speed is 25 percent higher than the normal  speed (10 divided by  $40=.25\times100=25$   percent), a factor  of 1.25. A factor of 1.25 squared is approximately 1.56;  the landing distance increases 56 percent over the normal  landing distance.  

On downwind approaches, a shallower approach angle should  be used, depending on obstacles in the approach path. Use the  spoilers/dive brakes and perhaps a forward slip, as necessary,  to achieve the desired glidepath.  

After touchdown, use the wheel brake and all available  drag devices to reduce groundspeed and stop as soon as is  practical. This is necessary to maintain control of the glider.  Landing with a tail wind means a loss of control at a much  higher ground speed and requires more braking action.  

Common errors during downwind landing include:  

•	 Improper glidepath control. •	 Improper use of slips. •	 Improper airspeed control. •	 Improper correction for wind. •	 Improper procedure for touchdown/landing. •	 Poor directional control during/after landing. •	 Improper use of wheel brakes.  

# After Landing and Securing  

After landing, move or taxi the glider clear of all runways. If  the glider is to be parked for a short interval between flights,  choose a spot that does not inconvenience other gliderport/ airport users. Protect the glider from wind by securing a  wingtip with a weight or by tying it down. Consult the  manufacturer’s handbook for the recommended methods  for securing the glider. Remember that even light winds  can cause gliders to move about, turn sideways, or cause  the higher wing in a parked glider to slam into the ground.  Because gliders are particularly vulnerable to wind effects,  the glider should be secured any time it is unattended.  

When the glider has finished flying for the day, move it to  the tiedown area. Secure the glider in accordance with the  recommendation in the GFM/POH. The tiedown anchors  should be strong and secure. Apply external control locks  to the glider flight control surfaces. Control locks should be  large, well marked, and brightly painted. If a cover is used to  protect the pitot tube, the cover should be large and brightly  colored. If a canopy cover is used, secure it so that the canopy  cover does not scuff or scratch the canopy in windy conditions.  

If the glider is stored in a hangar, be careful while moving  the glider to avoid damaging it or other aircraft in the hangar.  Chock the main wheel and tailwheel of the glider when it is  in position in the hangar. If stored in a wings-level position,  put a wing stand under each wingtip. If stored with one wing  high, place a weight on the lowered wing to hold it down.  

If the glider is to be disassembled and stored in a trailer, tow  the glider to the trailer area and align the fuselage with the  long axis of the trailer. Collect all tools and dollies required  to disassemble and stow the glider. Secure the trailer so  that loading the glider aboard does not move or upset the  trailer or trailer doors. Follow the disassembly checklist  in the GFM/POH. Stow the glider components securely in  the trailer. When the glider has been stowed and secured,  collect all tools and stow them properly. Close trailer doors  and hatches. Secure the trailer against wind and weather by  tying it down properly.  

# Performance Maneuvers  

# Straight Glides  

To perform a straight glide, the glider pilot must hold a  constant heading and airspeed. The heading reference should  be some prominent point in front of the glider on the ground.  The pilot also notes that, during a straight glide, each wingtip  should be an equal distance above the ground. With the wings  level, the pitch attitude is established with reference to a point  on or below the horizon to establish a specified airspeed. Any  change in pitch attitude results in a change in airspeed. There  is a pitch attitude reference for best glide speed, another for  the minimum sink speed, and another for slow flight. The  pitch attitude is adjusted with the elevator to hold the specific  airspeed. The glider elevator trim control allows the pilot to  trim the glider to hold a constant pitch attitude and, therefore,  a constant airspeed. Straight glides should be coordinated as  indicated by a centered yaw string or slip-skid ball.  

The glider pilot should also stay alert to airflow noise changes.  At a constant airspeed in coordinated flight, wind noise should  be constant. Any changes in airspeed or coordination cause  a change in the wind noise. Gusts that cause the airspeed to  change momentarily can be ignored. Holding the glider at  a constant pitch attitude results in maintaining the desired  airspeed control.  

The glider pilot should learn to fly throughout a wide range of  airspeeds, from minimum controllable airspeed to maximum  allowable airspeed. This enables the pilot to learn the feel of  the controls of the glider throughout its speed range. If the  glider is equipped with spoilers/dive brakes and/or flaps, the  glider pilot should become familiar with the changes that occur  in pitch attitude and airspeed when these controls are used.  

Common errors during straight glides include:  

•	 Rough or erratic pitch attitude and airspeed control. •	 Rough, uncoordinated, or inappropriate control  applications. •	 Failure to use trim or improper use of trim. •	 Improper use of controls when using spoilers, dive  brakes, and/or flaps. • 	 Prolonged uncoordinated flight—yaw or ball not  centered.

The performance of turns involves coordination of all three  flight controls: ailerons, rudder, and elevator. For purposes  of this discussion, turns are divided into the following three  classes as shown in  Figure 7-29 .  

•	 Shallow turns are those in which the bank (less than  approximately   $20^{\circ}$  ) is so shallow that the inherent  lateral stability of the glider levels the wings unless  some aileron is applied to maintain the bank. •	 Medium turns are those resulting from a degree of  bank (approximately   $20^{\circ}$   to   $45^{\circ}$  ) at which lateral  stability is overcome by the overbanking tendency,  resulting in no control inputs (other than elevator)  being required to maintain the angle.

Figure 7-29.  Shallow, medium, and steep turns.  

•	 Steep turns are those resulting from a degree of bank  (  $45^{\circ}$   or more) at which the overbanking tendency of  a glider overcomes stability, and the bank increases  unless aileron is applied to prevent it.  

Before starting any turn, the pilot must clear the airspace  in the direction of the turn. A glider is turned by banking  (lowering the wing in the direction of the desired turn, thus  raising the other). When the glider is flying straight, the total  lift is acting perpendicular to the wings and to the earth. As  the glider is banked into a turn, total lift becomes the resultant  of two components: 1) the vertical lift component continues  to act perpendicularly to the earth and opposes gravity and 2)  

the horizontal lift component (centripetal) acts parallel to the  earth’s surface and opposes inertia (apparent centrifugal force).  These two lift components act at right angles to each other,  causing the resultant total lifting force to act perpendicular  to the banked wing of the glider. It is the horizontal lift  component that actually turns the glider, not the rudder.  

# Roll-In  

When applying aileron to bank the glider, the aileron on the  rising wing is lowered, producing a greater drag than the  raised aileron on the lowering wing. This increased drag  causes the glider to yaw toward the rising wing or opposite the  direction of turn. To counteract this adverse yawing moment,  rudder pressure must be applied in the desired direction of  turn simultaneously with aileron pressure. This action is  required to produce a coordinated turn.  

After the bank has been established in a medium banked turn,  all pressure applied to the aileron may be relaxed. The glider  remains at the selected bank with no further tendency to yaw  since there is no longer a deflection of the ailerons. As a result,  pressure may also be relaxed on the rudder pedals, and the  rudder is allowed to streamline itself with the direction of the  slipstream. Rudder pressure maintained after establishing the  turn causes the glider to skid to the outside of the turn. If a  definite effort is made to center the rudder rather than let it  streamline itself to the turn, it is probable that some opposite  rudder pressure will be exerted inadvertently. This forces the  glider to yaw opposite its turning path, causing the glider to  slip to the inside of the turn. The yaw string or ball in the  slip indicator is displaced off center whenever the glider is  skidding or slipping sideways. In proper coordinated flight,  there is no skidding or slipping.  

In constant airspeed turns, it is necessary to increase the  AOA of the wing as the bank progresses by adding nose-up  elevator pressure. This is required because the total lift must  be equal to the vertical component of lift plus the horizontal  lift component. To stop the turn, coordinated use of the  aileron and rudder pressure are added to bring the wings back  to level flight as elevator pressure is relaxed.  

There is a direct relationship between airspeed, bank angle,  and rate and radius of turn. The rate of turn at any given  true airspeed depends on the horizontal lift component.  The horizontal lift component varies in proportion to the  amount of bank. Therefore, the rate of turn at a given true  airspeed increases as the angle of bank is increased. On the  other hand, when a turn is made at a higher true airspeed at  a given bank angle, the inertia is greater and the horizontal  lift component required for the turn is greater, causing the  turning rate to become slower. Therefore, at a given angle of  bank, a higher true airspeed makes the radius of turn larger  because the glider is turning at a slower rate.  

As the angle of bank is increased from a shallow bank to a  medium bank, the airspeed of the wing on the outside of the  turn increases in relation to the inside wing. The additional  lift developed by the bank balances the lateral stability of the  glider. No aileron pressure is required to maintain the bank.  At any given airspeed, aileron pressure is not required to  maintain the bank. If the bank is increased from a medium  bank to a steep bank, the radius of turn decreases even  further. The greater lift of the outside wing then causes the  bank to steepen, and opposite aileron is necessary to keep  the bank constant.  

As the radius of the turn becomes smaller, a significant  difference develops between the speed of the inside wing  and the speed of the outside wing. The wing on the outside  of the turn travels a longer circuit than the inside wing, yet  both complete their respective circuits in the same length of  time. Therefore, the outside wing travels faster than the inside  wing, and as a result, it develops more lift. This creates an  overbanking tendency that must be controlled by the use of  the ailerons. Because the outboard wing is developing more  lift, it also has more induced drag. This causes a slip during  steep turns that must be corrected by rudder usage.  

To establish the desired angle of bank, the pilot should use  visual reference points on the glider, the earth’s surface, and  the natural horizon. The pilot’s posture while seated in the  glider is very important, particularly during turns. It affects  the interpretation of outside visual references. The beginning  pilot may lean away from or into the turn rather than ride  with the glider. This should be corrected immediately if the  pilot is to properly learn to use visual references.  

Applications of large aileron and rudder produces rapid roll  rates and allow little time for corrections before the desired  bank is reached. Slower (small control displacement) roll  rates provide more time to make necessary pitch and bank  corrections. As soon as the glider rolls from the wings-level  attitude, the nose starts to move along the horizon, increasing  its rate of travel proportionately as the bank is increased.  

As the desired angle of bank is established, aileron and rudder  pressures should be relaxed. This prevents increase in bank  because the aileron and rudder control surfaces are neutral in  their streamlined position. The up-elevator pressure should  not be relaxed, but should be held constant to maintain the  desired airspeed. Throughout the turn, the pilot should cross- check the airspeed indicator to verify the proper pitch is being  maintained. The cross-check and instrument scan should  include outside visual references. If the glider is gaining  or losing airspeed, the pitch attitude should be adjusted in  relation to the horizon. During all turns, aileron, rudder, and  elevator are used to correct minor variations in pitch and  bank just as they are in straight glides.  

# Roll-Out  

The roll-out from a turn is similar to the roll-in except  that coordinated flight controls are applied in the opposite  direction. Aileron and rudder are applied in the direction  of the roll-out or toward the high wing. As the angle of  bank decreases, the elevator pressure should be relaxed, as  necessary, to maintain airspeed.  

Since the glider continues turning as long as there is any  bank, the roll-out must be started before reaching the desired  heading. The amount of lead required to roll out on the  desired heading depends on the degree of bank used in the  turn. Normally, the lead is one half the degrees of bank. For  example, if the bank is  $30^{\circ}$  , lead the roll-out by   $15^{\circ}$  . As the  wings become level, the control pressures should be smoothly  relaxed so the controls are neutralized as the glider returns to  straight flight. As the roll-out is being completed, attention  should be given to outside visual references, as well as the  airspeed and heading indicators to determine that the wings  are being leveled and the turn stopped.  

Common errors during a turn include:  

•	 Failure to clear turn. •	 Nose movement before the bank starts—rudder is  being applied too soon. •	 Commencement of bank before the nose starts turning,  or nose movement in the opposite direction—the  rudder is being applied too late. •	 Up or down nose movement when entering a bank— excessive or insufficient elevator is being applied. •	 Rough or uncoordinated use of controls during the  roll-in and roll-out. •	 Failure to establish and maintain the desired angle  of bank. •	 Overshooting/undershooting the desired heading.  

In a slipping turn, the glider is not turning at the rate appropriate  to the bank being used, since the glider is yawed toward the  outside of the turning flightpath. The glider is banked too much  for the rate of turn, so the horizontal lift component is greater  than the centrifugal force. Equilibrium between the horizontal  lift component and centrifugal force is reestablished either by  decreasing the bank (ailerons), increasing yaw (rudder), or a  combination of the two.  [Figure 7-30]

# Figure 7-30.  Slipping turn.  

A skidding turn results from an excess of centrifugal force  over the horizontal lift component, pulling the glider toward  the outside of the turn. The rate of turn is too great for the  angle of bank. Correction of a skidding turn thus involves a  decrease in yaw (rudder), an increase in bank (aileron), or a  combination of the two changes.  [Figure 7-31]  

![](images/d392bc3efd479112d9f5bb9092f82279dd992f8ef42b8f8825ddfc256ed94118.jpg)  
Figure 7-31.  Skidding turn.  

The yaw string identifies slips and skids. In flight, the rule  to remember is simple: step on the head of the yaw string.  If the head of the yaw string is to the right of the tail, then  the pilot needs to apply right pedal. If the head of the yaw  string is to the left of the tail, then the pilot should apply left  pedal.  [Figure 7-32]  

![](images/f02fd4e3d0ec3305a8a894c2004f84b5c5d48544739ed589327bdbeb025cf437.jpg)  
Figure 7-32.  Coordinated turn.  

The ball in the slip/skid indicator also indicates slips and  skids. When using this instrument for coordination, apply  rudder pressure on the side that the ball is offset (step on  the ball). Correction for uncoordinated condition should be  accomplished by using appropriate rudder and aileron control  pressures simultaneously to coordinate the glider.  

# Steep Turns  

Soaring flight requires competence in steep turns. In  thermalling flight, small-radius turns are often necessary to  keep the glider in or near the core of the thermal updraft where  lift is usually strongest and rapid climbs are possible. At any  given airspeed, increasing the angle of bank decreases the  radius of the turn and increases the rate of turn. The radius  of a turn at any given bank angle varies directly with the  square of the airspeed at which the turn is made; therefore,  the lower the airspeed is, the smaller the turn radius is. To  keep the radius of turn small, it is necessary to bank steeply  while maintaining an appropriate airspeed, such as minimum  sink or best glide speed. The pilot must be aware that as the  bank angle increases, the stall speed increases.  

Before starting the steep turn, the pilot should ensure that the  area is clear of other traffic since the rate of turn is quite rapid.  After establishing the appropriate airspeed, the glider should  be smoothly rolled into a coordinated steep turn with at least   $45^{\circ}$   of bank. The pilot should use outside visual reference  to establish and maintain the desired bank angle. If the pilot  does not add back pressure to maintain the desired airspeed  after the bank is established, the glider has a tendency to enter  a spiral. To counteract the overbanking tendency caused by  the steep turn, the pilot should apply top aileron pressure.  Because the top aileron pressure pulls the nose away from  the direction of the turn, the pilot also must apply bottom  rudder pressure. A coordinated (no slip or skid) steep turn  requires back pressure on the elevator for airspeed control, top  aileron pressure for bank control, and bottom rudder pressure  to streamline the fuselage with the flightpath.  

Common errors during steep turns include:  

•	 Failure to clear turn. •	 Uncoordinated use of controls. •	 Loss of orientation. •	 Failure to maintain airspeed within tolerance. •	 Unintentional stall or spin. •	 Excessive deviation from desired heading during  roll-out.  

# Maneuvering at Minimum Controllable Airspeed  

Maneuvering during slow flight demonstrates the flight  characteristics and degree of controllability of a glider at  minimum speeds. By definition, the term “flight at minimum  controllable airspeed” means a speed at which any further  increase in AOA or load factor causes an immediate stall.  Pilots must develop an awareness of the particular glider  flight characteristics in order to recognize and avoid stalls  that may inadvertently occur during the low airspeeds used  in takeoffs, climbs, thermaling, and approaches to landing.  

The objective of maneuvering at minimum controllable  airspeed is to develop the pilot’s sense of feel and ability  to use the controls correctly, and to improve proficiency  in performing maneuvers that require low airspeeds.  Maneuvering at minimum controllable airspeed should be  performed using outside visual reference. It is important that  pilots form the habit of frequently referencing the pitch attitude  of the glider for airspeed control while flying at low speeds.  

The maneuver is started from either best glide speed or  minimum sink speed. The pitch attitude is smoothly and  gradually increased. While the glider is losing airspeed,  the position of the nose in relation to the horizon should be  noted and should be adjusted as necessary until the minimum  controllable airspeed is established. During these changing  flight conditions, it is important to retrim the glider, as  necessary, to compensate for changes in control pressures.  Back pressure that is excessive or too aggressive on the  elevator control may result in an abrupt increase in pitch  attitude and a rapid decrease in airspeed, which lead to a  higher AOA and a possible stall. When the desired pitch  attitude and airspeed have been established, it is important  to continually cross-check the pitch attitude on the horizon  and the airspeed indicator to ensure accurate control is being  maintained.  

When minimum controllable airspeed is established in  straight flight, turns should be practiced to determine  the glider’s controllability characteristics at this selected  airspeed. During the turns, the pitch attitude may need to  be decreased in order to maintain the airspeed. If a steep  turn is encountered, and the pitch attitude is not decreased,  the increase in load factor may result in a stall. A stall may  also occur as a result of abrupt or rough control movements  resulting in momentary increases in load factor. Abruptly  raising the flaps during minimum controllable airspeed results  in sudden loss of lift and possibly causing a stall.  

Minimum controllable airspeed should also be practiced  with extended spoilers/dive brakes. This provides additional  understanding of the changes in pitch attitude caused by the  increase in drag from the spoilers/dive brakes.  

Actual minimum controllable airspeed depends upon various  conditions, such as the gross weight and CG location of the  glider and the maneuvering load imposed by turns and pull- ups. Flight at minimum controllable airspeed requires positive  use of rudder and ailerons. The diminished effectiveness of  the flight controls during flight at minimum controllable  airspeed helps pilots develop the ability to estimate the  margin of safety above the stalling speed.  

Common errors during maneuvers at minimum controllable  airspeed include:  

•	 Failure to establish or to maintain minimum  controllable airspeed. •	 Improper use of trim. •	 Rough or uncoordinated use of controls. •	 Failure to recognize indications of a stall.  

# Stall Recognition and Recovery  

All pilots must be proficient in stall recognition and recovery.  A stall can occur at any airspeed and at any attitude. In the  case of the self-launching glider under power, a stall can  also occur with any power setting. A stall occurs when the  smooth airflow over the glider’s wing is disrupted and the  wings stop producing enough lift. This occurs when the wing  exceeds its critical AOA.  

The practice of stall recovery and the development of stall  awareness are of primary importance in pilot training. The  objectives in performing intentional stalls are to familiarize  the pilot with the conditions that produce stalls, to assist in  recognizing an approaching stall, and to develop the habit of  taking prompt preventive or corrective action.  

Intentional stalls should be performed so the maneuver is  completed by 1,500 feet above the ground with a landing  area within gliding distance, in the event lift cannot be  found. Although it depends on the degree to which a stall has  progressed, most stalls require some loss of altitude during  recovery. The longer it takes to recognize the approaching  stall, the more complete the stall is likely to become, and the  greater the loss of altitude to be expected.  

Pilots must recognize the flight conditions that are conducive  to stalls and know how to apply the necessary corrective action  since most gliders do not have an electrical or mechanical  stall warning device. Pilots should learn to recognize an  approaching stall by sight, sound, and feel. The following cues  may be useful in recognizing the approaching stall.  

1.	 Vision—useful in detecting a stall condition by noting  the attitude of the glider versus the horizon. 2.	 Hearing—also helpful in sensing a stall condition.  In the case of a glider, a change in sound due to loss  of airspeed is particularly noticeable. The lessening  

of the noise made by the air flowing along the glider  structure as airspeed decreases is quite noticeable, and  when the stall is almost complete, the pilot starts to  feel airframe buffeting or aerodynamic vibration as  the stall occurs.  

3.	 Feeling  

a.	 Kinesthesia, or the sensing of changes in direction  or speed of motion, is an important intuitive  indicator to the trained and experienced pilot. If  this sensitivity is properly developed, it warns of  a decrease in speed or the beginning of a settling,  or mushing, of the glider.  

b.	 The feel of control pressures is also very  important. As speed is reduced, the resistance to  pressure on the controls becomes progressively  less. Pressures exerted on the controls tend to  become movements of the control surfaces. As the  airflow slows and stalls, the aerodynamic controls  (ailerons, elevator, and rudder) have significantly  less authority and require much more movement  to create the same amount of directional change as  compared to the normal flight regime responses.  As the wing airflow stalls and the stalling  strongly affects the controls, the controllability  of the glider can become questionable. Properly  designed and certificated gliders should retain  marginal control authority when the wing is  stalled. The lag between these movements and  the response of the glider becomes greater until  in a complete stall.  

Signs of an impending stall include the following:  

•	 Nose-high attitude for higher wing loading with  possible increasing trend. •	 Low airspeed indication with a decreasing trend. •	 Low airflow noise and decreasing. •	 Back pressure increasing, requiring more elevator  trimming and/or not having anymore aft trim.  •	 Poor control responses from the glider and decreasing  feedback pressures from control movements.  •	 Wing (airframe) buffeting as stalling begins. •	 Yaw string (if equipped) movement from normal flight  position.  

Always make clearing turns before performing stalls. During  the practice of intentional stalls, the real objective is not to  learn how to stall a glider, but to learn how to recognize an  approaching stall and take prompt corrective action. The  recovery actions must be taken in a coordinated manner.  

First, at the indication of a stall, the pitch attitude and AOA  must be decreased positively and immediately. Since the  basic cause of a stall is always an excessive AOA, the cause  must first be eliminated by releasing the back-elevator  pressure that was necessary to attain that AOA or by moving  the elevator control forward. This lowers the nose and returns  the wing to an effective AOA. The amount of elevator  control pressure or movement to use depends on the design  of the glider, the severity of the stall, and the proximity of  the ground. In some gliders, a moderate movement of the  elevator control—perhaps slightly forward of neutral—is  enough, while others may require a forcible push to the full  forward position. An excessive negative load on the wings  caused by excessive forward movement of the elevator may  impede, rather than hasten, the stall recovery. The object is  to reduce the AOA, but only enough to allow the wing to  regain lift.  [Figure 7-33]  

If stalls are practiced or encountered in a self-launching  glider, the maximum allowable power should be applied  during the stall recovery to increase the self-launching  glider’s speed and assist in reducing the wing’s AOA.  Generally, the throttle should be promptly, but smoothly,  advanced to the maximum allowable power. Although stall  recoveries should be practiced with and without power, in  self-launching gliders during actual stalls, the application of  power is an integral part of the stall recovery. Usually, the  greater the applied power is, the less the loss of altitude is.  Maximum allowable power applied at the instant of a stall  usually does not cause overspeeding of an engine equipped  with a fixed-pitch propeller, due to the heavy air load imposed  on the propeller at low airspeeds. However, it is necessary to  reduce the power as airspeed is gained after the stall recovery  so the airspeed does not become excessive.  

When performing intentional stalls, pilots should never allow  the engine to exceed its maximum designed rpm limitation.  The maximum rpm is marked by a red line on the engine  tachometer gauge. Exceeding rpm limitations can cause  damage to engine components.  

Whether in a towed glider or self-launching glider, stall  recovery is accomplished by leveling the wings and returning  to straight flight using coordinated flight controls. The first  few practice sessions should consist of approaches to stalls  with recovery initiated at the first airframe buffet or when  partial loss of control is noted. Using this method, pilots  become familiar with the initial indications of an approaching  stall without fully stalling the glider.  

Stall accidents usually result from an inadvertent stall at a  low altitude in which a recovery was not accomplished prior  to contact with the surface. As a preventive measure, stalls  should be practiced at an altitude that allows recovery at no  lower than 1,500 feet AGL and within gliding distance of a  landing area.  

Different types of gliders have different stall characteristics.  Most gliders are designed so the wings stall progressively  outward from the wing roots (where the wing attaches to the  fuselage) to the wingtips. This is the result of designing the  wings so the wingtips have a smaller angle of incidence than  the wing roots. When exceeding the critical angle of attack  results in a stall, the inner wing does not support normal  aerodynamic flight, but the outer part of the wing does  retain some aerodynamic effectiveness. Wings are designed  in this manner so aileron control is available at high AOA  (low airspeed) and to give the glider more stable stalling  characteristics. When the glider is in a stalled condition, the  wingtips continue to provide some degree of lift, and the  ailerons still have some control effect. During recovery from a  stall, the return of lift begins at the tips and progresses toward  the roots. Thus, the ailerons can be used to level the wings.  

Using the ailerons requires finesse to avoid an aggravated  stall condition. For example, if the right wing drops during  the stall and excessive aileron control is applied to the left  to raise the wing, the aileron that deflects downward (right  wing) would produce a greater AOA (and drag). Possibly a  more complete stall would occur at the tip, because the critical  AOA would be exceeded. The increase in drag created by the  

![](images/bd443d02932fb87aeffdeba336bf23b8ffb8ea92ea58d4a1a1fa4466f5f96976.jpg)  
Figure 7-33.  Stall recovery.  

high AOA on that wing might cause the airplane to yaw in  that direction. This adverse yaw could result in a spin unless  directional control were maintained by rudder and/or aileron  control is sufficiently reduced.  

Even though excessive aileron pressure may have been  applied, a spin does not occur if directional (yaw) control  is maintained by timely application of coordinated rudder  pressure. Therefore, it is important that the rudder be used  properly during both entry and recovery from a stall. The  primary use of the rudder in stall recovery is to counteract any  tendency of the glider to yaw. The correct recovery technique  would be to decrease the pitch attitude by applying forward  elevator pressure to reduce the AOA while simultaneously  maintaining directional control with coordinated use of the  aileron and rudder.  

Due to engineering design variations, the stall characteristics  for all gliders cannot be specifically described; however, the  similarities found in gliders are noteworthy enough to be  considered. The factors that affect the stalling characteristics  of the glider are weight and balance, bank and pitch attitude,  coordination, and drag. The pilot should learn the stall  characteristics of the glider being flown and the proper  correction procedures. It should be reemphasized that a  stall can occur at any airspeed, in any attitude, or at any  power setting in the case of a self-launching or sustaining  glider, depending on the total value of factors affecting the  particular glider.  

Whenever practicing stalls while turning, a constant bank  angle should be maintained until the stall occurs. After the  stall occurs, coordinated control inputs should be made to  return the glider to wings-level flight.  

Advanced stalls include secondary, accelerated, and crossed- control stalls. These stalls are extremely useful for pilots to  expand their knowledge of stall/spin awareness.  

# Secondary Stalls  

A secondary stall occurs after a recovery from a preceding  stall. It is caused by attempting to hasten the completion of a  stall recovery with abrupt control input before the glider has  regained sufficient flying speed and the critical AOA is again  exceeded. When this stall occurs, the back-elevator pressure  should again be released as in a normal stall recovery. When  sufficient airspeed has been regained, the glider can then be  returned to wings-level, straight flight.  

# Accelerated Stalls  

Although the stalls already discussed normally occur at a  specific airspeed, the pilot must thoroughly understand that  all stalls result solely from attempts to fly at excessively high  angles of attack. During flight, the AOA of a glider wing  is determined by a number of factors, the most important  of which are airspeed, gross weight of the glider, and load  factors imposed by maneuvering.  

At gross weight, the glider consistently stalls at the same  indicated airspeed if no acceleration is involved. However,  the glider stalls at a higher indicated airspeed when excessive  maneuvering loads are imposed by steep turns, pull-ups, or  other abrupt changes in its flightpath. Stalls entered from  such flight situations are called “accelerated maneuver stalls,  a term that has no reference to the airspeeds involved. Stalls  that result from abrupt maneuvers tend to be more rapid or  severe than the unaccelerated or steady state stall. Accelerated  stalls occur at higher-than-normal airspeeds and may be  unexpected by pilots. These accelerated stalls result when  the AOA exceeds the angle necessary to stall the airflow  over the wing. The relative wind angle increases as the loads  on the wings require more lift to change direction, either  vertically or horizontally, and inertia pushes the wings into  the airmass resulting in an increased AOA. Depending on  the wing configuration and quality of coordination, one wing  may stall prior to the other wing resulting in a wingover entry  into a spiral or spin. If the wings have a slight or pronounced  sweep, one wing can easily develop more lift than the other  wing almost instantaneously resulting in a wingover before  the pilot can react. This is the common killer scenario of a  pilot turning too tightly in the traffic pattern and crashing  upside down.  

Accelerated maneuver stalls should not be performed in any  glider in which this maneuver is prohibited by the GFM/ POH. If they are permitted, they should be performed with  a bank of approximately   $45^{\circ}$   and never at a speed greater  than the glider manufacturer’s recommended airspeeds or  the design maneuvering speed specified for the glider. The  design maneuvering speed is the maximum speed at which  the glider can be stalled or the application of full aerodynamic  control will not exceed the glider’s limit load factor. At  or below this speed, the glider is designed so that it stalls  before the limit load factor can be exceeded. The objective of  demonstrating accelerated stalls is not to develop competency  in setting up the stall, but rather to learn how they may occur  and to develop the ability to recognize a prestall situation  immediately and then take the proper recovery action. It is  important that recovery is made at the first indication of a  stall, or immediately after the stall has fully developed; a  prolonged stall condition should never be allowed.  

A glider stalls during a coordinated turn as it does from  straight flight, except the pitching and rolling actions tend  to be more sudden. If the glider is slipping toward the inside  of the turn at the time the stall occurs, it tends to roll rapidly  toward the outside of the turn as the nose pitches down  because the outside wing stalls before the inside wing. If  the glider is skidding toward the outside of the turn, it has a  tendency to roll to the inside of the turn because the inside  wing stalls first. If the coordination of the turn at the time of  the stall is accurate, the glider’s nose pitches away from the  pilot just as it does in a straight flight stall, since both wings  stall simultaneously. The configuration of the wings has a  strong influence on exactly how a glider reacts to different  airflows. The safe approach is to fly the specific glider into  these situations at higher altitudes to determine how that  glider reacts. The glider pilot should commit those newly  discovered prestall conditions and indications to memory to  avoid those conditions at lower altitudes where recovery is  improbable or impossible.  

Glider pilots enter an accelerated stall demonstration by  establishing the desired flight attitude and then, with smooth  actions, firmly and progressively increasing the AOA until a  stall occurs. Because of the rapidly changing flight attitude,  sudden stall entry, and possible loss of altitude, it is extremely  vital that the area be clear of other aircraft. Entry altitudes  should be adequate for safe recovery.  

Actual accelerated stalls occur most frequently during turns in  the traffic pattern close to the ground while maneuvering the  glider for the approach. The demonstration of an accelerated  stall is accomplished by exerting excessive back elevator  pressure. It usually occurs during improperly executed steep  turns, stall and spin recoveries, and pullouts from steep dives.  The objectives are to determine the stall characteristics of  the glider and develop the ability to instinctively recover at  the onset of a stall at other-than-normal stall speed or flight  attitudes. An accelerated stall, although usually demonstrated  in steep turns, may actually be encountered any time  excessive back-elevator pressure is applied and/or the AOA  is increased too rapidly.  

From straight flight at maneuvering speed or less, the glider  should be rolled into a steep banked (  $45^{\circ}$   maximum) turn and  back-elevator pressure gradually applied. After the bank is  established, back-elevator pressure should be smoothly and  steadily increased. The resulting apparent centrifugal force  pushes the pilot’s body down in the seat, increases the wing  loading, and decreases the airspeed. Back-elevator pressure  should be firmly increased until a definite stall occurs.  

When the glider stalls, recovery should be made promptly by  releasing back-elevator pressure. If the turn is uncoordinated,  one wing may tend to drop suddenly, causing the glider to roll  in that direction. If this occurs, the glider should be returned to  wings-level, straight flight with coordinated control pressure.  

A glider pilot should recognize when an accelerated stall is  imminent and take prompt action to prevent a completely  stalled condition. It is imperative that prolonged stalls,  excessive airspeed, or loss of altitude, and spins be avoided.  

# Crossed-Control Stalls  

The objective of a crossed-control stall demonstration  maneuver is to show the effect of improper control technique  and to emphasize the importance of using coordinated control  pressures whenever making turns. This type of stall occurs  with the controls crossed—aileron pressure applied in one  direction and rudder pressure in the opposite direction—and  the critical AOA is exceeded.  [Figure 7-34]

Figure 7-34.  Crossed-control approach to a stall.  

This is a stall that is most likely to occur during a poorly  planned and executed base-to-final approach turn, and often  is the result of overshooting the centerline of the runway  during that turn. Normally, the proper action to correct for  overshooting the runway is to increase the rate of turn by  using coordinated aileron and rudder. At the relatively low  altitude of a base-to-final approach turn, improperly trained  pilots may be apprehensive of steeping the bank to increase  the rate of turn.  

The addition of rudder pressure on the inside of the turn  causes the speed of the outer wing to increase, creating  greater lift on that wing. To keep that wing from rising and to  maintain a constant angle of bank, opposite aileron pressure  is required. The added inside rudder pressure also causes  the nose to lower in relation to the horizon. Consequently,  additional back-elevator pressure would be required to  maintain a constant pitch attitude. The resulting condition  is a turn with rudder applied in one direction, aileron in the  opposite direction, and excessive back-elevator pressure—a  pronounced crossed-control condition.  

Since the glider is in a skidding turn during the crossed- control condition, the wing on the outside of the turn increases  speed and produces more lift than the inside wing, and the  glider starts to increase its bank. The down aileron on the  inside of the turn helps drag that wing back, slowing it and  decreasing its lift. This further causes the glider to roll. The  roll may be so fast that it is possible the bank will be vertical  or past vertical before it can be stopped.  

For the demonstration of the maneuver, it is important that it  be entered at a safe altitude because of the possible extreme  nose-down attitude and loss of altitude that may result. Before  demonstrating this stall, the pilot should clear the area for  other air traffic. While the gliding attitude and airspeed are  being established, the glider should be retrimmed. When the  glide is stabilized, the glider should be rolled into a medium  banked turn to simulate a final approach turn that would  overshoot the centerline of the runway. During the turn,  excessive rudder pressure should be applied in the direction  of the turn but the bank held constant by applying opposite  aileron pressure. At the same time, increased back-elevator  pressure is required to keep the nose from lowering.  

All of these control pressures should be increased until the  glider stalls. When the stall occurs, releasing the control  pressures and simultaneously decreasing the AOA initiates  the recovery. In a crossed-control stall, the glider often stalls  with little warning. The nose may pitch down, the inside  wing may suddenly drop, and the glider may continue to  roll to an inverted position. This is usually the beginning of  a spin. It is obvious that close to the ground is no place to  allow this to happen.  

Recovery must be made before the glider enters an abnormal  attitude (vertical spiral or spin); it is a simple matter to  return to wings-level, straight flight by coordinated use of  the controls. The pilot must be able to recognize when this  stall is imminent and must take immediate action to prevent  a completely stalled condition. It is imperative that this type  of stall not occur during an actual approach to a landing,  since recovery may be impossible prior to ground contact  due to the low altitude.  

Common errors during advanced stalls include:  

•	 Improper pitch and bank control during straight-ahead  and turning stalls. •	 Rough or uncoordinated control procedures. •	 Failure to recognize the first indications of a stall. •	 Failure to achieve a stall. •	 Poor recognition and recovery procedures.  

•	 Excessive altitude loss or airspeed or encountering a  secondary stall during recovery.  

# Operating Airspeeds  

# Minimum Sink Airspeed  

Minimum sink airspeed is defined as the airspeed at which  the glider loses the least altitude in a given period of time.  Minimum sink airspeed varies with the weight of the glider.  Glider manufacturers publish altitude loss in feet per minute or  meters per second (e.g., 122 ft/min or  $0.62\,\mathrm{m/sec}$  ) at a specified  weight. Flying at minimum sink airspeed results in maximum  duration in the absence of convection in the atmosphere.  

The minimum sink airspeed given in the GFM/POH is based  on the following conditions.  

•	 The glider is wings level and flying a straight  flightpath; load factor is  $1.0\:\mathrm{G}$  . •	 The glider flight controls are perfectly coordinated. •	 Wing flaps are set to zero degrees and air brakes are  closed and locked. •	 The wings are free of bugs or other contaminants. •	 The glider is at a manufacturer-specified weight.  

While flying in a thermaling turn, the proper airspeed is the  minimum sink airspeed appropriate to the load factor, or  G-load, that the glider is undergoing. The glider’s stall speed  increases with load factor. The minimum sink speed needs to  be increased with an increase in load factor. Another factor  that always needs to be considered is that the gross weight and  stall speed of the glider can vary if equipped with water ballast,  which affects the minimum sink airspeed. For most gliders,  the following weights will be of greatest interest:  

1.	 Maximum gross weight with full water and both seats  occupied 2.	 Maximum gross weight with both seats occupied and  no water ballast 3.	 One pilot on board  

The effect of only weight on stall speed can be expressed by  using the basic lift formula that is manipulated and simplified to  derive the necessary information. The modified lift formula is:  

$$
\mathrm{\frac{V_{S}2}{V_{S}1}=\frac{\sqrt{W2}}{W1}}
$$  

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}\boldsymbol{1}=$   stall speed corresponding to some gross weight, W1

  $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}2\!=$   stall speed corresponding to a different gross weight, W2 This can be manipulated into  $\mathrm{V_{S}}$   times the square root of the  load factor (which equals weight  $\times\,\mathrm{G}$   loading).  

For example, if a glider stall speed is 34 knots, consider the  following formula   $(34\times\sqrt{1.2}$   (load factor)  $=34\times1.10=37$    at  $30^{\circ}$   ) for thermalling:  

•	 In a   $30^{\circ}$   banked turn, load factor is   $1.2~\mathrm{fs}$  . The  approximate square root of 1.2 is 1.1. Now multiply  34 knots times 1.1 yields a 37-knot stall speed. Since  the minimum sink speed is 40 which is still above  the stall speed but by only approximately 3 knots, the  margin of safety is decreasing and the pilot should  

consider increasing the minimum airspeed by a factor  proportionate to the stall speed increase, in this case  44 knots   $(40\times\sqrt{1.2}$   (load factor)  $=40\times1.10=44$   at   $30^{\circ}$  ).  •	 In a   $45^{\circ}$   banked turn, load factor is 1.18   $(34\times\sqrt{1.4}$     $=34\times1.18=40.12$   knots at   $45^{\circ}$  ). Now multiply 34  knots times 1.18 which yields a 41-knot stall speed.  The minimum sink speed of 40 knots is now below  the stall speed. The pilot should increase the minimum  airspeed proportionately to the stall airspeed, and the  new speed would be 48 knots   $(40\times\sqrt{1.4}$   (load factor)   $=41\times1.18=48$   at   $45^{\circ}$  ), a 7-knot safety factor. •	 In a   $60^{\circ}$   banked turn, load factor is 2.0 Gs. The  approximate square root of 2.0 is 1.4   $(34\times\sqrt{2.0}=34$     $\times\,1.41\,{=}\,48$   knots at  $60^{\circ}$  ). Now multiply 34 knots times  1.4 which yields a 48-knot stall speed. The minimum  sink speed of 40 knots is now below the stall speed.  The pilot should increase the minimum airspeed  proportionately to 57 knots, yielding an 9-knot safety   $(40\times\sqrt{2.0}$   (load factor)  $=40\times1.41=56.4$   at  $60^{\circ}$  ).  

Minimum sink airspeed is always lower than best L/D  airspeed at any given operating weight. If the operating weight  of the glider is noticeably less than maximum gross weight,  then the actual minimum sink airspeed at that operating  weight is lower than that published by the manufacturer.  

Common errors regarding minimum sink airspeed include:  

•	 Improper determination of minimum sink speed. •	 Failure to maintain proper pitch attitude and airspeed  control.  

# Best Glide Airspeed  

Best glide (L/D) airspeed is defined as the airspeed that results  in the least amount of altitude loss over a given distance. This  allows the glider to glide the greatest distance in still air. This  performance is expressed as glide ratio. The manufacturer  publishes the best glide airspeed for specified weights and  the resulting glide ratio. For example, a glide ratio of 36:1  means that the glider loses 1 foot of altitude for every 36  feet of forward movement in still air at this airspeed. The  glide ratio decreases at airspeeds above or below best glide  airspeed. The best glide speed can be found from the glider  polars in Chapter 5, Performance Limitations.  

Common errors regarding best glide airspeed include:  

•	 Improper determination of best airspeed to fly and not  factoring in lift and headwinds. •	 Failure to maintain proper pitch attitude and airspeed  control.  

# Speed to Fly  

Much is said about the importance of maintaining the  best gliding speed, but what is important is to maintain  an optimum glide speed, a penetration speed that takes  atmospheric conditions into account (e.g., sinking air or  a headwind). The gliding community refers to this as the  speed to fly. The normal recommendation for countering  a headwind is to add one-third to one-half of the estimated  wind speed to  $\mathrm{V_{BG}}$  , which increases the rate of sink but also  increases the ground speed. For a tailwind, deduct one-third  to one-half the estimated wind speed from   $\mathrm{V_{BG}}$  , which  reduces both the rate of sink and the groundspeed. Bear in  mind that, for safety, it is better to err towards higher rather  than lower airspeeds.  

To illustrate this, the polar curve in  Figure 7-35  indicates  the optimum glide speed when adjusted for headwind,  tailwind or sinking air. For a tailwind (A), the starting point  on the horizontal scale has been moved a distance to the left  corresponding to the tailwind velocity. Consequently, the  black tangential line contacts the curve at an optimal glide  speed that is lower than the best L/D no-wind glide (B), with a  slightly lower rate of sink. This is the opposite for a headwind  (C), shown by the purple line, and sinking air (D), shown  

![](images/f87d161b5fd23f9831f9f100c2e212e0d6dc1a04c3d87eb42eb6220e662fbde3.jpg)

by the yellow line. For sinking air, the starting point on the  vertical scale has been moved up a distance corresponding  to the vertical velocity of the air. Consequently, the red  tangential line contacts the curve at a glide speed higher than  best glide speed.  

Speed to fly depends on:  

1.	 The rate of climb the pilot expects to achieve in the  next thermal or updraft. 2.	 The rate of ascent or descent of the air mass through  which the glider is flying. 3.	 The glider’s inherent sink rate at all airspeeds between  minimum-sink airspeed and never-exceed airspeed. 4.	 Headwind or tailwind conditions.  

The object of speed to fly is to minimize the time and/or  altitude required to fly from the current position to the next  thermal and to minimize time in sink and maximize time in  lift. Speed-to-fly information is presented to the pilot in one  or more of the following ways:  

•	 By placing a speed-to-fly ring (MacCready ring)  around the variometer dial. •	 Using the appropriate table or chart. •	 Using an electronic flight computer that displays the  current optimum speed to fly.  

The pilot determines the speed to fly during initial planning  and then constantly updates this information in flight. The  pilot must be aware of changes in the flying conditions in  order to be successful in conducting cross-country flights or  during a soaring competition.  

Common errors regarding speed to fly are:  

•	 Improper determination of speed to fly. •	 Failure to maintain proper pitch attitude and airspeed  control. •	 Not transitioning from cruise speed to climb speed in  lift as needed and not changing to cruise speed when  leaving lift in a prudent manner.  

# Abnormal and Emergency  Procedures  

# Introduction  

Training for abnormal and emergency procedures is an  essential element in becoming a glider pilot. Knowledge  of procedures is required for coping with control problems,  instrument failure, or equipment malfunction. This is  especially important in soaring activities. Understanding  how to use emergency equipment and survival gear is a  practical necessity.  

# Porpoising  

Porpoising is a general term that refers to pitch oscillations  that can occur in gliders and aircraft in general. In most cases,  pilots induce these oscillations through overcontrolling the  glider as they attempt to stop the oscillations from occurring  in the first place.  

# Pilot-Induced Oscillations (PIOs)  

The instability of a glider’s attitude that arises when the  pilot fails to recognize the lag time inherent in controlling  the glider is known as a pilot-induced oscillation (PIO).  Typically, PIOs occur when the glider fails to respond  instantly to control input and the pilot quickly increases  the pressure on the controls. By the time the pilot judges  that the glider is responding satisfactorily, the extra control  pressures have resulted in such a vigorous response that the  glider overshoots the desired flight attitude. In an attempt to  correct the situation, the pilot moves the controls rapidly in  the opposite direction, overcompensating for the mistake.  The undesired glider motion slows, stops for an instant,  and then reverses. The alarmed pilot maintains significant  control pressures to try to increase the rate of response.  The glider, now in rapid motion in the desired direction in  response to heavy-handed control inputs, again shoots past  the desired attitude as the now thoroughly alarmed pilot jerks  the flight controls in the opposite direction. Unless the pilot  understands that these oscillations are the direct result of  overcontrolling the glider, it is unlikely that the oscillations  will cease. More likely, they increase in intensity until there  is a complete loss of control.  

Although PIOs can occur at anytime, these situations arise  most commonly during primary training. Pitch instability is  another result of center of gravity aft beyond limits. If a pilot  encounters PIO, they should ensure the CG is within limits.  Pitch instability tends to disappear as pilot experience grows  because pilots gain familiarity with the lag time inherent in  the flight controls. These types of oscillations may also occur  when a pilot is making flights in unfamiliar types of gliders.  For this reason, particular care must be taken when the pilot  is preparing to fly a single-seat glider in which the pilot has  no prior experience. When checking out a new make of  single seat glider, the lag time of the flight controls must be  learned without the obvious benefit of having an experienced  glider flight instructor aboard during flight to offer advice or,  if necessary, to intervene. While most PIO discussions are  devoted to pitch oscillations, consideration should be given  to roll-and-yaw induced oscillations.  

The first step toward interrupting the PIO cycle is to recognize  the lag time inherent in the glider’s response. Any change in  glider flight attitude takes an appreciable amount of time to  accomplish as the flight controls take effect, and the mass of  the glider responds to the pilot’s control inputs. The second  step is to modify control inputs to avoid overcontrolling the  glider. The correct technique is to pressure the controls until  the glider begins to respond in the desired direction, and then  ease off the pressure. As the glider nears the desired attitude,  center the appropriate flight control so that overshooting  does not occur.  

# PIOs During Launch  

PIOs are most likely to occur during launch because the  glider’s lag time changes rapidly as the glider accelerates.  During the first moments of the takeoff roll, aerodynamic  control is poor, the control feel of the glider is very sluggish,  and lag time is great. Flight controls require a wide range of  movement or input to have an effect on the glider’s flightpath.  As the glider gains speed, aerodynamic response improves,  control feel becomes crisper, and lag time decreases. When  the glider has acquired safe flying speed, lag time is short,  the controls feel normal, and PIOs become much less likely.  

# Factors Influencing PIOs  

The characteristics of the towhook/towline combination on  pitch of the glider being flown may cause uncommanded pitch  excursions if the pilot does not compensate for those effects.  This can contribute to PIO during aerotow launch. In addition,  the propwash and wing vortices of the towplane, through  which the glider must pass if there is little or no crosswind,  affect the flight attitude and control response of the glider,  especially at low speeds during the start of the takeoff roll.  

To minimize the influence of the towplane’s wake, use a  towline of adequate length—200 feet is the minimum length  for normal towing operations. A longer towline provides  more isolation from towplane wake during aerotow launch.  Short towlines, on the other hand, keep the glider closer to the  towplane and its turbulent wake, complicating the problem  of controlling the glider.  

There are several techniques that reduce the likelihood and  severity of PIOs during aerotow launch. A pilot should  not try to lift off until confident that flying speed and good  aerodynamic control has been achieved. Also, just after the  moment of lift-off, allow the glider to rise several feet above  the runway before stabilizing the altitude of the glider. Two  to three feet is high enough that minor excursions in pitch  attitude, if corrected promptly, do not result in glider contact  with the runway surface, but not high enough to lose sight  of the towplane below the nose of the glider. Caution should  be exercised if attempting to stabilize the glider just a few  inches above the ground because it provides little margin for  error if a PIO occurs.  

# Improper Elevator Trim Setting  

The elevator trim control position also contributes to PIO  in pitch attitude. The takeoff checklist includes a check to  confirm the proper takeoff elevator trim setting. Trim set  properly for takeoff results in normal elevator pressures felt  through the control stick is normal, and the likelihood of PIO  is reduced. If the elevator trim is set incorrectly, however,  abnormal elevator pressure is felt through the control stick  and may contribute to PIO.  

Excessively nose-down trim requires the pilot to hold back  pressure on the control stick to achieve and maintain the  desired pitch attitude during launch and climb-out. If the trim  is set excessively nose up, the pilot needs to hold forward  pressure. The more pressure is needed, the more likely it is  that the pilot overcontrols the glider.  

Although all gliders exhibit these tendencies if the trim  is improperly set, the effect is most pronounced on those  gliders with an aerodynamic elevator trim tab or an antiservo  tab on the elevator. The effect usually is less pronounced  on those glider fitted with a simple spring system elevator  trim. Regardless of the type of elevator trim installed in the  glider, error prevention is superior to error correction. Use a  comprehensive pretakeoff checklist and set the elevator trim  in the appropriate position prior to launch to help prevent PIO  attributable to elevator trim misuse.  [Figure 8-1]  

# Improper Wing Flaps Setting  

The likelihood of PIOs increases if the wing flaps are not  correctly set in the desired takeoff position. For the majority  of flap-equipped gliders, most Glider Flight Manuals/Pilot  Operating Handbooks (GFM/POH) recommend that flaps be  set at   $0^{\circ}$   for takeoff. Pilots should review their GFM/POH  for the manufacturer recommendation for takeoff settings.  

If the flaps are incorrectly set for takeoff, a positive flap  setting increases wing camber and wing lift, the glider tends  to rise off the runway prematurely, perhaps even before the  elevator control is sufficient to control the pitch attitude.  Attempting to prevent the glider from ballooning high above  the runway, the pilot may exert considerable forward pressure  on the control stick. As the glider continues to accelerate,  this forward pressure on the control stick exerts a rapidly  increasing nose-down force on the glider due to the increasing  airflow over the elevator. When the glider eventually pitches  down, the pilot may exert considerable back pressure on the  stick to arrest the descent. Severe pitching or PIOs are likely  to result. If allowed to continue, hard contact with the runway  surface may result in glider damage and personal injury.  

If the wing flaps are incorrectly set to a negative flap setting,  decreasing wing camber and wing lift, then takeoff may be  delayed so long that the towplane lifts off and begins to climb  out while the glider is still rolling down the runway, unable  to get airborne. Excessive back pressure on the control stick  may eventually assist the glider in leaving the runway, but  the relatively high airspeed at lift-off translates into a very  effective elevator, and ballooning may occur as a result of the  extreme elevator position. Overcorrecting for the ballooning  with excessive forward pressure on the control stick increases  the magnitude of this pitch excursion. A series of PIOs may  result. If this condition is allowed to continue, the launch  could lead to a premature termination of the tow.  

# Pilot-Induced Roll Oscillations During Launch  

Pilot-induced roll oscillations occur primarily during launch,  particularly via aerotow. As the tow pilot applies full power,  the glider moves forward, balanced laterally on its main wheel  by the wing-runner. After the wing-runner releases his or her  balancing hold, aerodynamics or crosswind could cause a  wing to drop. If a wingtip begins to drop toward the ground  before the glider achieves significant speed, aileron control is  marginal and considerable stick displacement must be applied  to elicit a response from the glider’s ailerons. As the glider  accelerates, the control response improves and the latency of  response from the glider shortens. As acceleration continues,  the pilot must recognize the increased responsiveness of the  glider to avoid overcontrolling the glider.  [Figure 8-2]  

Although roll oscillations can develop during ground  launch operations, they occur less often than during aerotow  operations because excellent aerodynamic control of the  glider is quickly achieved due to the rapid acceleration. Since  control improves as acceleration increases, operations that

Figure 8-2.  Pilot-induced roll oscillations during takeoff roll.  

use a strong winch or launch vehicle are less likely to be  hampered by oscillations.  

Wing mass also affects roll oscillations. During low speeds,  if the wings do not stay level, the pilot applies considerable  aileron pressure to return the wings to level attitude. Because  of the large mass and considerable aerodynamic damping  that long-winged gliders exhibit, there is a considerable lag  time from the moment pressure is applied until the moment  the wings are level again. Inexperienced pilots maintain  considerable pressure on the ailerons until the wings are level  before releasing control pressure. The wings continue their  rolling moment due to their mass, length, and momentum  about the longitudinal axis of the glider. The pilot senses  this momentum too late, and applies considerable pressure in  the opposite direction in another attempt to level the wings.  

After a time, the wings respond and roll back to level,  whereupon the pilot centers the ailerons once again. As  before, the momentum of the wings about the longitudinal  axis is considerable, and the wings continue their motion  in roll. This series of PIOs may continue until one wingtip  contacts the ground, possibly with considerable force, causing  wing damage or a ground loop and an aborted launch. To  reduce the likelihood of this type of roll oscillation, anticipate  the momentum of the glider wings about the longitudinal axis  and reduce aileron control pressure as the wings approach  the level position.  

# Pilot-Induced Yaw Oscillations During Launch  

Pilot-induced yaw oscillations are usually caused by  overcontrolling the rudder. As with roll oscillations, the  problem is the failure of the pilot to recognize that the  glider is accelerating and has considerable momentum. If  the glider veers away from the towplane, rudder application  in the appropriate direction helps correct the situation. If the  rudder pressure is held too long, the large yaw momentum  of the glider wings and fuselage results in overshooting  the desired yaw position and veering off in the opposite  direction. Overcompensating for large yaw, the pilot applies  considerable rudder pressure in the direction opposite from  the original rudder pressure. The alarmed pilot now applies  considerable rudder pressure in the direction opposite the  original rudder pressure. As the glider continues to accelerate,  the power of the rudder increases and the lag time decreases.  In extreme cases, the glider may veer off the runway and  collide with runway border markers, airport lights, parked  glider, or other obstacles. The cure for this type of yaw  oscillation is anticipating the momentum of the glider wings  and fuselage about the vertical axis and reduce rudder pedal  pressure when the nose of the glider begins to yaw in the  desired direction in response to rudder inputs.  [Figure 8-3]  

When a glider’s wingtip contacts the ground during takeoff  roll, an uncommanded yaw results. The drag of the wingtip  on the ground induces a yaw in the direction of the grounded  wingtip. The yaw usually is mild if the wingtip is on smooth  pavement but much more vigorous if the wingtip is dragging  through tall grass. If appropriate aileron pressure fails to  raise the wingtip off the ground quickly, the only solution is  to release the towline and abort the takeoff attempt before  losing all control of the glider.  

The greater the wing mass is and the longer the wingspan  is, the more momentum the glider exhibits whenever roll or  yaw oscillations arise. Some very high performance gliders  feature remarkably long and heavy wings; once in motion,  they tend to remain in motion for a considerable time. This  is true not only of forward momentum, but yaw and roll  momentum as well. The mass of the wings, coupled with  the very long moment arm of large-span wings, results in  substantial lag times in response to aileron and rudder inputs

Figure 8-3.  Pilot-induced yaw oscillations during takeoff roll.  

during the early portion of the takeoff roll and during the  latter portion of the landing rollout. Even highly proficient  glider pilots find takeoffs and landings in these gliders to be  challenging. Many of these gliders are designed for racing  or cross-country flights and have provisions for adding water  ballast to the wings. Adding ballast increases mass, which  results in an increase in lag time.  

Low time pilots and pilots new to such high performance  gliders should review the GFM/POH thoroughly prior to  flight. It is also recommended to review normal procedures,  emergency procedures, and the glider’s fight characteristics  with a qualified pilot or instructor pilot before attempting  flight in any high performance glider.  

# Gust-Induced Oscillations  

Gusty headwinds can induce pitch oscillations because the  effectiveness of the elevator varies due to changes in the  speed of the airflow over the elevator. Crosswinds also can  induce yaw and roll oscillations. In gusty crosswinds, the  effects on glider control change rapidly depending on the  speed and rate of the crosswind component. A crosswind  from the right, for instance, tends to weathervane the glider  into the wind, causing an uncommanded yaw to the right.  Crosswinds tend to lift the upwind wing of the glider and  push the tail downwind.  

Local terrain can have a considerable effect on the wind.  Wind blowing over and around obstacles can be gusty and  chaotic. Nearby obstacles, such as hangars, groves or lines  of trees, hills, and ridges can have a pronounced effect on  low altitude winds, particularly on the downwind side of the  obstruction. In general, the effect of an upwind obstacle is to  induce additional turbulence and gustiness in the wind. These  conditions are usually found from the surface to an altitude  of 300 feet or more. If flight in these conditions cannot be  avoided, the general rule during takeoff is to achieve a faster- than-normal speed prior to lift-off.  

The additional speed increases the responsiveness of  the controls and simplifies the problem of correcting for  turbulence and gusts. This provides a measure of protection  against PIOs. The additional speed also provides a safer  margin above stall airspeed. This is very desirable on gusty  days because variations in the headwind component have a  considerable effect on indicated airspeed.  

Caution: Do not exceed the glider’s tow speed limitations when  adding safety speed margins for takeoff in windy conditions.  

# Vertical Gusts During High-Speed Cruise  

Although PIOs occur most commonly during launch, they  can occur during cruising flight, even when cruising at high  speed. Turbulence usually plays a role in this type of PIO,  as does the elasticity and flexibility of the glider structure.  An example is an encounter with an abrupt updraft during  wings-level high-speed cruise. The upward-blowing gust  increases the angle of attack of the wings, which bend upward  very quickly, storing elastic energy in the wing spars. For a  moment, the G-loading in the cabin is significantly greater  than one G. Like a compressed coil spring seeking release,  the wing spars reflex downward, lofting the fuselage higher.  When the fuselage reaches the top of this motion, the wing  spars are storing elastic energy in the downward direction, and  the fuselage is sprung downward in response to the release of  elastic energy in the wing spars. The pilot then experiences  reduced G-load, accompanied perhaps by a head bang against  the top of the canopy if the seat belt and shoulder harness are  loosely fastened.  

During these excursions, the weight of the pilot’s hand and  arm on the control stick may cause the control stick to move a  significant distance forward or aft. During positive G-loading,  the increased apparent weight of the pilot’s arm tends to move  the control stick aft, further increasing the angle of attack of  the wing and G-load factor. During negative G-loading, the  reduced apparent weight of the pilot’s arm tends to result  in forward stick motion, reducing the angle of attack and  reducing the G-load factor still further. In short, this rapid  cycle of induced flight control input affects load factor and  increases the intensity of vertical gusts on the glider’s airframe  and the pilot. One protection against this is to reduce speed  when cruising through turbulent air. Another protection is  to brace both arms and use both hands on the control stick  when cruising through turbulent air at high speed. It is worth  noting that some glider designs incorporate a parallelogram  control stick linkage to reduce the tendency toward PIO during  high-speed cruise.  

# Pilot-Induced Pitch Oscillations During Landing  

Instances of PIO may occur during the landing approach in  turbulent air for the same reasons previously stated. Landing  the glider involves interacting with ground effect during the  flare and keeping precise control of the glider even as airspeed  decays and control authority declines. A pilot can cause a  PIO by overcontrolling the elevator during the flare, causing  the glider to balloon well above the landing surface even as  airspeed is decreasing. If the pilot reacts by pushing the stick  well forward, the glider will quickly dive for the ground with  a fairly rapid rate of descent. If the pilot pulls the control  stick back to arrest this descent while still in possession of  considerable airspeed, the glider balloons again and the PIO  cycle continues. If airspeed is low when the pilot pulls back  on the stick to avoid a hard landing, there will probably be  insufficient lift available to arrest the descent. A hard or a  nose-first landing may result.  

To reduce ballooning during the flare, stabilize the glider at  an altitude of 3 or 4 feet, and then begin the flare anew. Do  not try to force the nose of the glider down on to the runway.  If airspeed during the ballooning is low and the ballooning  takes the glider higher than a normal flare altitude, it may be  necessary to reduce the extension of the spoilers/dive brakes  in order to moderate the descent rate of the glider. Care must  be taken to avoid abrupt changes. Partial retraction of the  spoilers/dive brakes allows the wing to provide a bit more  lift despite decaying airspeed.  

Another source of PIOs during the approach to landing is  overly abrupt adjustment of the spoilers/dive brakes setting.  

The spoilers/dive brakes on most modern gliders provide a  very large amount of drag when fully deployed, and they  reduce the lift of the wing considerably. Excessive use of the  spoilers/dive brakes during the approach to land can easily  lead to oscillations in pitch attitude and airspeed changes.  The easiest way to guard against these oscillations is to  make smooth adjustments in the spoilers/dive brakes setting  whenever spoilers/dive brakes adjustment is necessary. This  becomes particularly important during the landing flare just  prior to touchdown. A sudden increase in spoilers/dive brakes  extension results in a high sink rate and possible hard contact  with the runway. This can lead to a rebound into the air,  setting the stage for a series of PIOs. As before, the cure is  to stabilize the glider, then resume the flare. If the spoilers/ dive brakes are retracted abruptly during the flare, the glider  will probably balloon into the air because of the increased  lift provided by the wings. Remember, spoiler/dive brakes  provide drag and reduce lift. This extra lift and pilot reaction  may result in overcontrolling and PIOs. The use of spoiler/ dive brakes should be determined by flight conditions. If a  wind gust has caused the glider to balloon, then spoiler/dive  brake use is an option for the pilot to reestablish the flare  attitude. If the spoilers/dive brakes must be adjusted, do so  with a smooth, gentle motion.  

# Glider-Induced Oscillations  

# Pitch Influence of the Glider Towhook Position  

The location of the glider’s aerotow towhook influences  pitch attitude control of the glider during aerotow operations.  During these operations, the towline is under considerable  tension. If the towline is connected to a glider towhook  located more or less directly on the longitudinal axis of  the glider, the towline tension has little effect on the pitch  attitude of the glider.  

On many gliders, the tow hook is located below the cockpit or  just forward of the landing gear. Many European gliders have  the towhook located on the belly of the glider, just forward  of the main landing gear and below the longitudinal axis of  the glider. The glider’s center of mass is above the location  of the towhook in this position. In fact, virtually all of the  glider’s mass is above the towhook. The mass of the glider  has inertia and resists acceleration when the towline tension  increases. In these tow hook configurations, an increase in  tension on the towline causes an uncommanded pitch-up of  the glider nose as shown in  Figure 8-4 . Decrease in towline  tension results in an uncommanded pitch-down.  

Rapid changes in towline tension, most likely to occur during  aerotow in turbulent air, cause these effects in alternation.  Naturally, on days when good lift is available, the aerotow is  conducted in turbulent air. The potential for inducing pitch

Figure 8-4.  Effects of increased towline tension on pitch altitude of bellyhook-equipped glider during aerotow.  

oscillations is obvious, as rapid alternations in towline tension  induce rapid changes in the pitch attitude of the glider. To  maintain a steady pitch attitude during aerotow, the pilot must  be alert to variations in towline tension and adjust pressure on  the flight controls to counteract the pitch effect of variations  in towline tension.  

# Self-Launching Glider Oscillations During  Powered Flight  

In some self-launching gliders and gliders equipped with  a sustainer engine, the engine is extended above the glider  just behind the cockpit. The engine’s propeller thrust vector  is located above the glider’s longitudinal axis and center of  mass.  [Figure 8-5]  This combination of engine and airframe  exhibits a complex relationship between power setting and  pitch attitude. When power changes are made, the propeller’s  thrust line vector has a noticeable effect on the glider’s pitch  attitude. This includes the effects of propeller wash over  the elevator causing variations in elevator effectiveness and  adding to the complexities of flight. Prior to flight, study  the GFM/POH carefully to discover what these undesired  effects are and how to counteract them. When throttle settings  must be changed, it is good practice to move the throttle

Figure 8-5.  Pitch attitude power setting relationships for self- launching glider with engine pod.  

control smoothly and gradually, coordinating with proper  flight control input. This gives the pilot time to recognize  and counteract the effect the power setting change has on  pitch attitude. In most self-launching gliders, the effect is  greatest when flying at or near minimum controllable airspeed  (VMCA). Self-launching glider pilots should avoid slow  flight when flying at low altitude under power.  [Figure 8-5]  

Self-launching gliders may also be susceptible to PIOs during  takeoff roll, particularly those with a pylon engine mounted  high above the longitudinal axis.  [Figure 8-5]  The high  thrust vector and the propeller wash influence on the air flow  over the self-launching glider’s elevator may tend to cause  considerable change in the pitch attitude of the glider when  power changes are made.  

# Nosewheel Glider Oscillations During Launches  and Landings  

Many tandem two-seat fiberglass gliders, and some single- seat fiberglass gliders, feature a three-wheel landing gear  configuration. The main wheel is equipped with a traditional  large pneumatic tire; the tailwheel and the nosewheel are  equipped with smaller pneumatic tires. During ground  operations, if the pneumatic nosewheel remains in contact  with the ground, any bump compresses the nosewheel  tire. When the pneumatic nosewheel tire rebounds, an  uncommanded pitch-up occurs. If the pitch-up is sufficient,  as is likely to be the case after hitting a bump at fast taxi  speeds, the tailwheel contacts the runway, compresses, and  rebounds. This can result in porpoising, as the nosewheel  and tailwheel alternate in hitting the runway, compressing,  and rebounding. In extreme cases, the fuselage of the glider  may be heavily damaged. During takeoff roll, the best way  to avoid porpoising in a nosewheel-equipped glider is to use  the elevator to lift the nosewheel off the runway as soon as  practicable, then set the pitch attitude so the glider’s main  wheel is the only wheel in contact with the ground. To avoid  porpoising during landing, hold the glider off during the flare  until the main wheel and tailwheel touch simultaneously.  During roll out, use the elevator to keep the nosewheel off  the ground for as long as possible.  

# Tailwheel/Tailskid Equipped Glider Oscillations  During Launches and Landings  

Most gliders have a tailwheel. When loaded and ready for  flight, these gliders have the main wheel and the tailwheel or  tailskid in contact with the ground. In these gliders, the center  of gravity is aft of the main wheel(s). Because of this, any  upward thrust on the main landing gear tends to pitch the nose  of the glider upward unless the tailwheel or tailskid is in contact  with the ground and prevents the change in pitch attitude.  

Upward thrust on the main landing gear can occur in  numerous circumstances. One cause is a bump in the runway  surface during takeoff or landing roll. If the resultant pitch- up is vigorous enough, it is likely that the glider leaves  the ground momentarily. If airspeed is slow, the elevator  control is marginal. As the pilot reacts to the unexpected  bounce or launch, overcontrolling the elevator results in a  PIO.  [Figure 8-6]  

Improper landing technique in a tailwheel glider also  can lead to upward thrust on the main landing gear and  subsequent PIOs. Landing a tailwheel glider in a nose-down  attitude, or even in a level pitch attitude, can lead to trouble.  If the main wheel contacts the ground before the tailwheel  or tailskid, the compression of the pneumatic tire and its  inevitable rebound provides significant upward thrust. The  glider nose may pitch up, the angle of attack increases, and  the glider becomes airborne. As before, overcontrol of the  elevator leads to PIOs.  

To prevent this type of PIO, do not allow the glider to settle  onto the landing surface with a nose-down attitude or with  excess airspeed. During the landing flare, hold the glider  a few inches above the ground with gentle backpressure  on the control stick as necessary. The speed decays and  the pitch attitude gradually changes to a slightly nose-up  pitch attitude. The ideal touchdown is simultaneous gentle  contact of main wheel and tailwheel or tailskid. Delaying  the touchdown just a small amount results in the tailwheel  or tailskid contacting the landing surface an instant before  the mainwheel. This type of landing may be acceptable  and desirable for many tailwheel gliders because it makes  a rebound into the air very unlikely. Consult the GFM/POH  for the glider being flown for further information about  recommended procedure for touchdown.  

# Aerotow Abnormal and Emergency  Procedures  

# Abnormal Procedures  

Mechanical equipment failure, environmental factors, and  pilot error can cause abnormal aerotow occurrences during  climb-out. Mechanical equipment failures can be caused  by towline and towhook failures, towplane mechanical  failures, and glider mechanical failures. Towline failure  (one that breaks unexpectedly) can result from using a  weak or worn towline. Towline failures can be avoided by  using appropriately rated towline material, weak links when  necessary, proper tow rings, and proper towline maintenance.  

Towhook system failures include uncommanded towline  releases or the inability to release. These failures can occur  in either the towplane or the glider towhook system. Proper  preflight and maintenance of these systems should help to  avoid these types of failures. Towplane mechanical failures  can involve the powerplant or airframe. When the tow  pilot or glider pilot encounters a mechanical failure, he or  she should signal the glider pilot to release immediately.  [Figure 8-7]  This is one of many situations that make it  vitally important that both the tow pilot and glider pilot have  a thorough knowledge of aerotow visual signals.  

Glider mechanical failure can include towhook system  malfunctions, flight control problems, and improper assembly  or rigging. If a mechanical failure occurs, the glider pilot must  assess the situation to determine the best course of action. In  some situations, it may be beneficial to remain on the aerotow,  while other situations may require immediate release.  

If the glider release mechanism fails, the tow pilot should be  notified either by radio or tow signal and the glider should  maintain the high tow position. The tow pilot should tow the  glider over the gliderport/airport and release the glider from  the towplane. The towline should fall back and below the  glider. The design of the Schweizer towhook mechanism is  such that the line pulls free from the glider by its own weight.

Figure 8-7.  Towplane and glider signal due to release mechanism failure.  

Since some gliders do not back release, the glider pilot should  pull the release to ensure the towline is in fact released.  

Towplanes are usually fitted with a variant of the Schweizer  or Tost glider tow hitch.  [Figures 8-8  and  8-9]  The hitch is  usually located at the extreme end of the rear fuselage below  the rudder. The specific rings used to attach towlines to these  hitch types can be seen in  Figure 8-10 . The wing runner  must be familiar with the correct method of attachment. If  the towplane has the Schweizer tow hitch, it is possible for  the tow ring to rotate forward so that it traps the sleeve that  locks the tow hitch in place. This may prevent the tow pilot  from releasing the towline.  [Figure 8-11]  

![](images/997f9ecb43807ef4a22fca714b7a9b0499a25a45a40f5b66afbc840e5ef86556.jpg)  
Figure 8-8.  A Schweizer tow hitch.  

Failure of both towplane and glider release mechanisms is  extremely rare. If it occurs, however, radio or tow signals  between glider pilot and tow pilot should verify this situation.  The glider pilot should move down to the low tow position  

![](images/7bbf062d900e2fa783d594ef78289a85c7137753e6d0b627644003d37b037f62.jpg)

once the descent has started to the gliderport/airport. The  glider pilot needs to use spoilers/dive brakes to maintain  the low tow position and to avoid overtaking the towplane.  The tow pilot should plan the approach to avoid obstacles.  The approach should be shallow enough for the glider to  touch down first. The glider pilot should use the spoilers/ dive brakes to stay on the runway, and use the wheel brake  as necessary to avoid overtaking the towplane. Excessive use  of the glider wheel brake may result in a hard landing for  the towplane because the towline could slow the towplane  below flying speed. Another valid method would be to stay on  tow until well within gliding distance of the airport and then  breaking the towline. The best experience to date suggests the  procedure to break the towline would be by climbing above  and diving down to develop slackline, then fully extending the  dive brakes and/or spoilers to set up the overload condition  as the towplane begins to accelerate without the load of the  glider and the glider is decelerating due to the increase in  drag. Once the towline breaks, the glider lands using the  procedures of having the line attached, in case the line did  not break at the gliders weak link.  

Environmental factors for terminating the tow include  encountering clouds, mountain rotors (area of turbulence  created by wind and mountainous terrain), or restricted  visibility. Any of these factors may require the glider pilot  to release from the aerotow. During the aerotow, each pilot  is responsible for avoiding situations that would place the  other pilot at risk.  

For the towplane pilot, examples of pilot error include  deliberately starting the takeoff before the glider pilot has  signaled the glider is ready for launch, using steep banks  during the aerotow without prior consent of the glider  pilot, or frivolous use of aerotow signals, such as “release  immediately!” For the glider pilot, examples of pilot error  include rising high above the towplane during takeoff and  climb or leaving air brakes open during takeoff and climb.  

The glider pilot may choose to deliberately terminate the  tow/launch anytime it may appear to be a safer course of  action.  For example, the pilot discovers control binding once  air pressure builds on the surfaces, releasing the towline is  the better alternative than getting too high to stop and too  low to bailout.  

# Towing Failures  

Premature terminations of the tow have been a leading cause  of glider accidents and incidents according to the Soaring  Safety Foundation. Towing failure incidents related to  rope breaks are not as common as other distractions in the  glider cockpit. Extension of spoilers/dive brakes, unlocked  canopies, and other distractions are major causes of the tow  failure incidents leading to a towline break. Prevention is  achieved with the proper use checklists and proper prelaunch  discipline. There are five planning situations regarding in- motion towline breaks, uncommanded release, or power loss  of the towplane and are listed below. While the best course  of action depends on many variables, such as runway length,  airport environment, density altitude, and wind, all tow  failures or emergency release have one thing in common:  the need to maintain control of the glider. Two possibilities  are stalling the glider or dragging a wingtip on the ground  during a low altitude turn.  

On takeoff, all towplanes may plan to drift downwind if there  is a wind present. If there is no wind or traffic, then the tow  pilot should select an area on the take path/profile that has the  fewest obstacles for both the towplane and glider. The tow  pilot should plan to drift in that direction. This downwind  drift does a few things for the glider pilot, the most important  of which is that it ensures the glider has maneuverability if a  tow failure occurs. This downwind drift allows the glider pilot  to complete the course reversal without the need of extensive  lower altitude turns to line up on the runway, reducing the  possibility of dragging a glider wingtip on the ground during  a low altitude turn. The tow pilot must initiate this drift.  Remember, tow pilots need to know wind direction and plan  accordingly to allow the glider pilot maneuverability options.  

If the towplane proceeds straight out, the glider pilot may  need to  make the last alignment turn at a low altitude. The  first turn is the course reversal; a second turn aligns the  glider with the landing area. As mentioned, the low altitude  turn may be difficult or impossible to complete. Winds may  compound the situation if the turn is not planned properly.  Pilots under these high-stress conditions sometimes cross- control the glider, compounding the issue. Remember, keep  the yaw string or ball centered.  

# Tow Failure With Runway To Land and Stop  

If a tow failure occurs or is inadvertently or deliberately  released prior to towplane liftoff, the standard procedure is  for the towplane either to continue the takeoff and clear the  runway or abort the takeoff and remain on the left side of the  runway. If the towplane loses power during the takeoff, the  tow pilot should maneuver the towplane to the left side of the  runway. If the glider is still on the runway, the glider pilot  should pull the release, decelerate using the wheel brake, and  be prepared to maneuver to the right side of the runway. If the  line breaks, is inadvertently released, or the towplane loses  power after the glider is airborne, the glider pilot should pull  the towline release, land ahead, and be prepared to maneuver  to the right side of the runway.  [Figure 8-12, panel 1]  Pulling  the towline release in either case ensures that the rope is clear  of the glider. Since local procedures vary, both glider pilot  and tow pilot must be familiar with the specific gliderport/ airport procedures.  

# Tow Failure Without Runway To Land Below  Returning Altitude  

If an inadvertent release, towline break, or a signal to release  from the towplane occurs at a point at which the glider  has insufficient runway directly ahead and has insufficient  altitude (200 feet above ground level AGL) to make a safe  turn, the best course of action is to land the glider ahead.  [Figure 8-12, panel   $2J$   When flying at higher elevations,  a higher altitude return may be necessary to return to the  runway due to increased ground speed and air density.  After touchdown, use the wheel brake to slow and stop as  conditions permit. Attempting to turn at low altitude prior to  landing is very risky because of the likelihood of dragging a  wingtip on the ground or stalling the glider. Landing ahead  and slowing the glider as much as possible prior to touching  down and rolling onto unknown terrain is usually the safest  course of action. Low speed means low impact forces, which  reduce both the likelihood of injury and risk of significant  damage to the glider. Gliders pilots should always be looking  on both sides and ahead trying to plan for the best area to  land in the event of a premature landing. The greater amount  of altitude the glider pilot has the greater number of options  that are open to them during an emergency. Landing under  control is always preferable to the “perfect” landing area  almost within glide distance.  

# Tow Failure Above Return to Runway Altitude  

A downwind landing on the departure runway may be  attempted if an inadvertent release, towline break, or signal  to release from the towplane occurs after the towplane  and glider are airborne, and the glider possesses sufficient  altitude to make a course reversal, which is determined by  wind crab angle, wind velocity, and glider groundspeed.  [Figure 8-12, panel 3]  

The course reversal and downwind landing option should  be used only if the glider is within gliding distance of the  airport or landing area. In ideal conditions, a minimum  altitude of 200 feet above ground level (AGL) is required  to complete this maneuver safely. Such factors as a hot day,  weak towplane, strong wind, or other traffic may require a  greater altitude to make a return to the airport a viable option.  

The responsibility of the glider pilot is to avoid the towplane,  if the tow is terminated due to a towplane emergency; the tow  pilot is also dealing with an emergency situation and may  maneuver the aircraft abruptly. The glider pilot should never  follow the towplane down if the towplane is experiencing  engine problems or engine failure.  

After releasing from the towplane at low altitude, if the glider  pilot chooses to make a turn of approximately   $180^{\circ}$   and a  downwind landing, the first responsibility is to maintain flying  speed. The pilot must immediately lower the nose to achieve  the proper pitch attitude necessary to maintain the appropriate  approach airspeed. If a rope break occurred in the process, the  glider pilot should release the rope portion still attached to the  glider to avoid any entanglement on landing with the glider.  

Make the initial turn into the wind. Use a   $45^{\circ}$   to   $60^{\circ}$   bank  angle as necessary to make the course reversal to the  departure. This provides a safe margin above stall speed  and allows a course reversal turn to be completed in a timely  manner. Using a bank angle that is too shallow may not  allow enough time for the glider to align with the landing  area. An excessively steep bank angle may result in an  accelerated stall or wingtip ground contact. If the turn is  made into the wind, only minor course corrections should be  necessary to align the glider with the intended landing area  

![](images/ff94f47ac6cea219a8e22a7a61c40ce69d69977e14b5eaf70a09339e31f9d745.jpg)  
Figure 8-12.  Situations for towline break, uncommanded release, or power loss of the towplane.  

if the glider was allowed to drift downwind. Throughout the  maneuver, the pilot must maintain the appropriate approach  speed and proper coordination. Remember to keep the yaw  string straight and ball centered (see Turns section for more  information on the yaw string).  

Downwind landings result in higher groundspeed due to  the effect of tailwind. The glider pilot must maintain the  appropriate approach airspeed. During the straight-in portion  of the approach, spoilers/dive brakes should be used as  necessary to control the descent path. Landing downwind  results in a shallower than normal approach. Groundspeed  is higher during a downwind landing and is especially  noticeable during the flare. After touchdown, spoilers/dive  brakes and wheel brakes should be used as necessary to slow  and stop the glider as quickly as possible. During the later part  of the rollout, the glider feels unresponsive to the controls  despite the fact that it is rolling along the runway at a higher  than normal groundspeed. It is important to stop the glider  before any loss of directional control.  

# Tow Failure Above 800' AGL  

When the emergency occurs at or above 800 feet above the  ground, the glider pilot may have more time to assess the  situation. Depending on the gliderport/airport environment,  the pilot may choose to land on a cross runway, into  the wind on the departure runway, or on a taxiway.  [Figure 8-12, panel 4]  In some situations, an off-gliderport/ off-airport landing may be safer than attempting to land on  the gliderport/airport.  

# Tow Failure Above Traffic Pattern Altitude  

If an emergency occurs above the traffic pattern altitude, the  glider pilot should maneuver away from the towplane, release  the towline if still attached, and turn toward the gliderport/ airport. The glider pilot should evaluate the situation to  determine if there is sufficient altitude to search for lift or if  it is necessary to return to the gliderport/airport for a landing.  Pilots should remember their obligation when dropping objects  from an aircraft according to Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations part 91, section 91.15, and not create a hazard to  persons and property on the ground.  [Figure 8-12, panel 4]  

# Slack Line  

Slack line is a reduction of tension in the towline. If the  slack is severe enough, it might entangle the glider or cause  damage to the glider or towplane. The following situations  may result in a slack line:  

•	 Abrupt power reduction by the towplane •	 Aerotow descents •	 Glider turns inside the towplane turn radius  [Figure 8-13]  

![](images/aab1664f3dcd636ce9687447c449daff8a486542fcf05c1490563d9320fc4346.jpg)  
Figure 8-13.  Glider bank is steeper than that of towplane, causing  slack in towline.  

•	 Updrafts and downdrafts  

•	 Abrupt recovery from a wake box corner position  [Figure 8-14]  

![](images/40d05fc2b5e866a795b89f0cab27844daf78be790bc5bcdee5b7476ca6f487ea.jpg)  
Figure 8-14.  One method of generating towline slack.  

When the towplane precedes the glider into an updraft, the  glider pilot first perceives that the towplane is climbing much  faster and higher than it actually is. Then, as the glider enters  the updraft, it is lighter and more efficient than the towplane.  It climbs higher and faster than the towplane did in the same  updraft. As a result, the glider pilot pitches the glider over to  regain the proper tow altitude but gains airspeed more quickly  than the towplane, hence the slack towline. The glider pilot  must be ready to control the descent and closure rate to the  towplane by increasing drag.  

Slack line recovery procedures should be initiated as soon  as the glider pilot becomes aware of the situation. The  glider pilot should try slipping back into alignment with the  towplane. In the event that slipping motion fails to reduce  the slack sufficiently, careful use of spoilers/dive brakes can  decelerate the glider and take up the slack. As the towline  begins to tighten, stabilize the tow and gradually resume  the desired aerotow position. When slack in the towline is  excessive, or beyond the pilot’s capability to safely recover,  the glider pilot should immediately release from the aerotow.  

Common errors regarding a slack line include:  

•	 Failure to take corrective action at the first indication  of a slack line. •	 Use of improper procedure to correct slack line  causing excessive stress on the towline, towplane,  and the glider. •	 Failure to decrease drag as towline slack decreases.  

# Ground Launch Abnormal and  Emergency Procedures  

# Abnormal Procedures  

The launch equipment operator manages ground launch  towline speed. Because the launch equipment operator is  remote from the glider, it is not uncommon for initial tow to  be too fast or too slow. If the towline speed is too great, the  glider is not able to climb very high because of excessive  airspeed. If the towline speed is too low, the glider may be  incapable of lift-off or could stall after becoming airborne.  Once airborne, the glider could be incapable of further  climb. The pilot should use appropriate signals to direct the  launch operator to increase or decrease speed. The pilot must  anticipate and be prepared to deal with these situations. In  the event these abnormal situations develop, the pilot’s only  alternative may be to release the towline and land ahead.  

Wind gradient (a sudden increase in windspeed with height)  can have a noticeable effect on ground launches. If the  wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the  pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, indicated airspeed  increases that could exceed the maximum ground launch  tow speed could occur. The pilot must adjust the airspeed  to deal with the effect of the gradient. When encountering  a wind gradient, the pilot should push forward on the stick  to reduce the indicated airspeed.  [Figure 8-15]  The only  way for the glider to resume climb without exceeding the  maximum ground launch airspeed is for the pilot to signal  the launch operator to reduce tow speed. After the reduction  of the towing speed, the pilot can resume normal climb. If  the tow speed is not reduced, the glider may be incapable of  climbing to safe altitude.  

Ground launch may be interrupted by a ground launch  mechanism malfunction. A gradual deceleration in rate  of climb and/or airspeed may be an indication of such a  malfunction. If a launch mechanism malfunction is suspected,  release and land ahead.  

# Emergency Procedures  

A broken towline is the most common type of problem when  doing a ground launch.  [Figure 8-16]  When there is a towline  failure, the glider pilot must pull the release handle and  immediately lower the nose of the glider to achieve and maintain  a safe airspeed. The distinguishing features of the ground launch  are nose-high pitch attitude and a relatively low altitude for a  significant portion of the launch and climb. If a towline break  occurs and the glider pilot fails to respond promptly, the nose- high attitude of the glider may result in a stall. Altitude may  be insufficient for recovery unless the pilot recognizes and  responds to the towline break by lowering the nose.  

If the glider tow release mechanism fails, the pilot should fly  at airspeeds no lower than best lift over drag (L/D) airspeed.  He or she should fly over and then past the ground launch  equipment. This method allows the glider towhook back  release to activate or the towline weak link to fail. The ground  launch equipment is also equipped with an emergency release  mechanism in the event the glider tow release fails. If a winch  is used, it is equipped with a guillotine to cut the towline.  If a motor vehicle is used as a ground launch, it should be  equipped with some form of backup release mechanism.

The pilot of a self-launching glider should formulate  emergency plans for any type of failure that might occur.  Thorough knowledge of aircraft performance data, normal  takeoff/landing procedures, and emergency procedures as  outlined in the GFM/POH are essential to the successful  management of any emergency situation.  

Mismanagement of the aircraft systems through lack of  knowledge may cause serious difficulty. For instance, if  the spoilers/dive brakes are allowed to open during takeoff  and climb, the self-launching glider may be incapable of  generating sufficient power to continue climbing. Other  emergency situations may include inflight fire, structural  failure, encounters with severe turbulence/wind shear,  canopy failure, and inadvertent encounter with instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC).  

Possible options for handling emergencies are influenced by  the altitude above the terrain, wind, and weather conditions.  As a part of preflight planning, pilots should review the  effects of density altitude on glider performance. The takeoff  runway length and landing areas near the gliderport and  existing air traffic affect the pilot’s approach and landing  decision. Emergency options may include landing ahead on  the remaining runway, landing off field, or returning to the  gliderport to land on an available runway. The appropriate  emergency procedures may be found in the GFM/POH for  the specific self-launching glider.  

# Spiral Dives  

Allowing the nose of the glider to get excessively low during  a steep turn may result in a significant increase in airspeed  and loss in altitude, creating a spiral dive. If the pilot attempts  to recover from this situation by applying only back elevator  pressure, the limiting load factor may be exceeded, causing  structural failure. To recover from a spiral dive properly, the  pilot should first reduce the angle of bank with coordinated  use of the rudder and aileron, then smoothly increase pitch  to the proper attitude.  

Common errors during spiral dives include:  

•	 Failure to recognize when a spiral dive is developing. •	 Rough, abrupt, and/or uncoordinated control  application during recovery. •	 Improper sequence of control applications.  

# Spins  

All flight instructor applicants must be proficient in spins.  A spin may be defined as an aggravated stall that results  in autorotation wherein the glider follows a downward  corkscrew path. As the glider rotates around a vertical axis,  the rising wing is less stalled than the descending wing,  creating a rolling, yawing, and pitching motion. The glider  is basically being forced downward by rolling, yawing, and  pitching in a spiral path.  [Figure 8-17]  

![](images/68dd594b4e34581dcef884bdfcf6e2294397bbf254da3b3398f23379378de8c4.jpg)  
Figure 8-17.  Autorotation of spinning glider.  

The autorotation results from an unequal angle of attack on  the glider’s wings. The rising wing has a decreasing angle  of attack in which the relative lift increases and the drag  decreases. In effect, this wing is less stalled. Meanwhile, the  descending wing has an increasing angle of attack, past the  wing’s critical angle of attack (stall) where the relative lift  decreases and drag increases.  

A spin is caused when the glider’s wing exceeds its critical  angle of attack (stall) with a sideslip or yaw acting on the  glider at, or beyond, the actual stall. During this uncoordinated  maneuver, a pilot may not be aware that a critical angle of  attack has been exceeded until the glider yaws out of control  toward the lowering wing. If stall recovery is not initiated  immediately, the glider may enter a spin. If this stall occurs  while the glider is in a slipping or skidding turn, this can  result in a spin entry and rotation in the direction that the  rudder is being applied, regardless of which wingtip is raised.  

Many gliders must be forced to spin and require good  judgment and technique to get the spin started. These same  gliders may be put into a spin accidentally by mishandling the  controls in turns, stalls, and flight at minimum controllable  airspeeds. This fact is additional evidence of the necessity  for the practice of stalls until the ability to recognize and  recover from them is developed.  

Often a wing drops at the beginning of a stall. When this  happens, the nose attempts to move (yaw) in the direction  of the low wing. This is when use of the rudder is important  during a stall. The correct amount of opposite rudder must  be applied to keep the nose from yawing toward the low  wing. By maintaining directional control and not allowing  the nose to yaw toward the low wing before stall recovery  is initiated, a spin is averted. If the nose is allowed to yaw  during the stall, the glider begins to skid in the direction of  the lowered wing and enters a spin.  

A glider must be stalled in order to enter a spin; therefore,  continued practice of stall recognition helps the pilot develop  a more instinctive and prompt reaction in recognizing an  approaching spin. It is essential to learn to apply immediate  corrective action any time it is apparent the glider is  approaching spin conditions. If it is impossible to avoid a spin,  the pilot should immediately execute spin recovery procedures.  

The flight instructor should demonstrate spins and spin  recovery techniques with emphasis on any special spin  procedures or techniques required for a particular glider.  Before beginning any spin operations, the following items  should be reviewed:  

•	 GFM/POH limitations section, placards, or type  certification data sheet, to determine if the glider is  approved for spins •	 Weight and balance limitations •	 Proper recommended entry and recovery procedures •	 The requirements for parachutes. It would be  appropriate to review current Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 for the latest  parachute requirements.  

A thorough glider preflight should be accomplished with  special emphasis on excess or loose items that may affect  the weight, CG, and controllability of the glider. Slack or  loose control cables (particularly rudder and elevator) could  prevent full antispin control deflections and delay or preclude  recovery in some gliders.  

Prior to beginning spin training, the flight area above and  below the glider must be clear of other air traffic. Clearing  the area may be accomplished while slowing the glider for  the spin entry. All spin training should be initiated at an  altitude high enough for a completed recovery at or above  1,500 feet AGL within gliding distance of a landing area.  There are four phases of a spin: entry, incipient, developed,  and recovery.  

# Entry Phase  

In the entry phase, the pilot provides the necessary elements  for the spin, either accidentally or intentionally. The entry  procedure for demonstrating a spin is similar to a stall. As  the glider approaches a stall, smoothly apply full rudder in  the direction of the desired spin rotation while applying full  back (up) elevator to the limit of travel. Always maintain  the ailerons in the neutral position during the spin procedure  unless the GFM/POH specifies otherwise.  

# Incipient Phase  

The incipient phase takes place between the time the glider  stalls and rotation starts until the spin has fully developed.  This change may take up to two turns for most gliders. An  incipient spin that is not allowed to develop into a steady- state spin is the most commonly used in the introduction  to spin training and recovery techniques. In this phase, the  aerodynamic and inertial forces have not achieved a balance.  As the incipient spin develops, the indicated airspeed should  be near or below stall airspeed. The incipient spin recovery  procedure should be commenced prior to the completion of   $360^{\circ}$   of rotation. The pilot should apply full rudder opposite  the direction of rotation.  

# Developed Phase  

The developed phase occurs when the glider’s angular  rotation rate, airspeed, and vertical speed are stabilized while  in a flightpath that is nearly vertical. This is, when glider  aerodynamic forces and inertial forces are in balance and the  attitude, angles, and self-sustaining motions about the vertical  axis are constant or repetitive, the spin is in equilibrium.  

# Recovery Phase  

The recovery phase occurs when the angle of attack of  the wings drops below the critical angle of attack and  autorotation slows. Then, the nose drops below the spin  pitch attitude and rotation stops. This phase may last  for a quarter turn to several turns. To recover, control  inputs are initiated to disrupt the spin equilibrium by  stopping the rotation and stall. To accomplish spin  recovery, the manufacturer’s recommended procedures  should be followed. In the absence of the manufacturer’s  recommended spin recovery procedures, the following steps  for general spin recovery are recommended:  

1.	 Position the ailerons to neutral. Ailerons may have an  adverse effect on spin recovery. Aileron control in the  direction of the spin may increase the rate of rotation  and delay the recovery. Aileron control opposite the  direction of the spin may cause the down aileron to  move the wing deeper into the stall and aggravate  the situation. The best procedure is to ensure that the  ailerons are neutral. If the flaps are extended prior to  the spin, they should be retracted as soon as possible  after spin entry.  

2.	 Apply full opposite rudder against the rotation.  Ensure that full (against the stop) opposite rudder  has been applied.  

3.	 When rotation stops, apply a positive and brisk,  straightforward movement of the elevator control past  neutral to break the stall. The forceful movement of  the elevator decreases the excessive angle of attack  and breaks the stall. The controls should be held firmly  in this position.  

4.	 After spin rotation stops, neutralize the rudder. If  the rudder is not neutralized at this time, the ensuing  increased airspeed acting upon a deflected rudder causes  a yawing effect. Slow and overly cautious control  movements during spin recovery must be avoided. In  certain cases, it has been found that such movements  result in the glider continuing to spin indefinitely, even  with antispin inputs. A brisk and positive technique, on  the other hand, results in a more positive spin recovery.  

5.	 Begin applying back-elevator pressure to raise the  nose to level flight. Caution must be used not to apply  excessive back-elevator pressure after the rotation  stops. Excessive back-elevator pressure can cause a  secondary stall and result in another spin. Care should  be taken not to exceed the G-load limits and airspeed  limitations during recovery.  

It is important to remember that the above spin recovery  procedures are recommended for use only in the absence of  the manufacturer’s procedures. Before any pilot attempts  to begin spin training, the pilot must be familiar with the  procedures provided by the manufacturer for spin recovery.  

The most common problems in spin recovery include pilot  confusion in determining the direction of spin rotation and  whether the maneuver is a spin or a spiral. If the airspeed is  increasing, the glider is no longer in a spin but in a spiral.  In a spin, the glider is stalled and the airspeed is at or below  stalling speed.  

Common errors when encountering/practicing spins include:  

•	 Failure to establish proper configuration prior to  spin entry. •	 Failure to correct airspeed for spin entry. •	 Failure to recognize conditions leading to a spin. •	 Failure to achieve and maintain stall during spin entry. •	 Improper use of controls during spin entry, rotation,  and/or recovery. •	 Disorientation during spin. •	 Failure to distinguish a spiral dive from a spin. •	 Excessive speed or secondary stall during spin  recovery. •	 Failure to recover with minimum loss of altitude. •	 Failure to recover above minimum altitude with a  landing area within gliding distance.  

# Off-Field Landing Procedures  

The possibility of an off-field landing is present on virtually  every cross-country soaring flight, even when flying in a self- launching glider. If the engine or power system fails and there  is no airport within gliding range, an off-field landing may  be inevitable. It should be noted that many glider pilots not  flying cross-country have faced the necessity of performing  an off-field landing. Causes of off-field landings while  soaring in the vicinity of the launching airport, include rapid  weather deterioration, a significant change in wind direction,  unanticipated amounts of sinking air, disorientation, lack of  situational awareness, tow failures, and other emergencies  requiring an off-field landing. In these situations, it usually  is safer to make a precautionary off-field landing than it is to  attempt a low, straight-in approach to the airport. If the glide  back to the airport comes up short for any reason, the landing  is likely to be poorly executed and may result in damage to  the glider or injury to the pilot.  

On cross-country soaring flights, off-field landings are not  usually considered emergency landings. As a matter of fact,  they are expected and are considered while preparing for  flight. On the other hand, if equipment failure leads to the  necessity of performing an off-field landing, then the landing  can be characterized or described as an emergency landing.  Whatever the reason for the off-field landing, each glider  pilot must be prepared at all times to plan and execute the  landing safely.  

Unlike airport landings, no off-field landing is entirely  routine. An extra measure of care must be undertaken to  achieve a safe outcome. The basic ingredients for a successful  off-field landing are awareness of wind direction, wind  strength at the surface, and approach path obstacles. The  glider pilot must be able to identify suitable landing areas,  have the discipline to select a suitable landing area while  height remains to allow sufficient time to perform a safe  approach and landing, and the ability to make consistently  accurate landings in the glider type being flown.  

These basic ingredients for a successful off-field landing can  be summarized as follows:  

•	 Recognizing the possibility of imminent off-field  landing. •	 Selecting a suitable area, then a suitable landing field  within that area. •	 Planning the approach with wind, obstacles, and local  terrain in mind. •	 Executing the approach, land, and then stopping the  glider as soon as possible. •	 Attempting to contact ground crew and notifying them  of off-field landing location.  

The most common off-field landing planning failure is denial.  The pilot, understandably eager to continue the flight and  return to an airport, is often reluctant to initiate planning for  an off-field landing because, in the pilot’s mind, to do so  probably results in such a landing. It would be better, the pilot  thinks, to concentrate on continuing the flight and finding a  way to climb back up and fly away. The danger of this false  optimism is that there is little or no time to plan an off-field  landing if the attempt to climb away does not succeed. It  is much safer to thoroughly understand the techniques of  planning an off-field landing and to be prepared for the  occurrence at any time.  

Wind awareness, knowing wind direction and intensity, is key  when planning an off-field landing. Flying downwind offers  a greater geographical area to search than flying upwind. The  tailwind during downwind cruise results in a greater range;  a headwind during upwind cruise reduces the range. Wind  awareness is also essential to planning the orientation and  direction of the landing approach. Visualize the wind flowing  over and around the intended landing area. Remember that  the area downwind of hills, buildings, and other obstructions  will probably be turbulent at low altitude. Also, be aware that  landing into wind shortens landing rolls.  

Decision heights are altitudes at which pilots take critical steps  in the off-field landing process. If the terrain below is suitable  for landing, select a general area no lower than 2,000 feet  above ground level (AGL). Select the intended landing field  no lower than 1,500 feet AGL. At 1,000 feet AGL, commit to  flying the approach and landing off field. If the terrain below  is not acceptable for an off-field landing, the best course of  action is to move immediately toward more suitable terrain.  

For many pilots, there is a strong temptation during the  off-field landing process to select a landing location based  primarily on the ease of glider retrieval. The convenience of  an easy retrieval is of little consequence if the landing site is  unsuitable and results in damage to the glider or injury to the  pilot. Select the landing site with safety as the highest priority.  During an off-field landing approach, the precise elevation  of the landing site is usually unavailable to the pilot. This  renders the altimeter more or less useless. Fly the approach  and assess the progress by recognizing and maintaining  the angle that puts the glider at the intended landing spot  safely. If landing into a strong headwind, the approach angle  is steep. If headwind is light or nonexistent, the approach  angle is shallower unless landing over an obstacle. When  landing with a tailwind (due to slope or one-way entry into  the selected field due to terrain or obstacles), the angle is  shallower. Remember to clear each visible obstacle with  safe altitude, clearing any poles and wires by a safe margin.  Always keep in mind that from the air, wires are basically  invisible until they are right in front of you, whereas towers  are visible from a distance. Any time there are two supporting  structures (telephone poles) it is safe to assume that there are  wires connecting them.  

Select a field of adequate length and, if possible, one with no  visible slope. Any slope that is visible from the air is likely to  be steep. Slope can often be assessed by the color of the land.  High spots often are lighter in color than low spots because  soil moisture tends to collect in low spots, darkening the color  of the soil. If level landing areas are not available and the  landing must be made on a slope, it is better to land uphill than  downhill. Even a slight downhill grade during landing flare  allows the glider to float prior to touchdown, which may result  in collision with objects on the far end of the selected field.  

Knowledge of local vegetation and crops is also very useful.  Tall crops are generally more dangerous to land in than low  crops. Know the colors of local seasonal vegetation to help  identify crops and other vegetation from the air. Without  exception, avoid discontinuities such as lines or crop changes.  Discontinuities usually exist because a fence, ditch, irrigation  pipe, or some other obstacle to machinery or cultivation is  present. Other obstacles may be present in the vicinity of the  chosen field. Trees and buildings are easy to spot, but power  and telephone lines and poles are more difficult to see from  pattern altitude. Take a careful look around to find them.  Assume every pole is connected by wire to every other pole.  Also assume that every pole is connected by wire to every  building, and that every building is connected by wire to  every other building. Plan the approach to overfly the wires  that may be present, even if you cannot see them. The more  visible the landing area is during the approach, the fewer  unpleasant surprises there are likely to be.  

The recommended approach procedure is to fly the following  legs in the pattern:  

•	 Crosswind leg on the downwind side of the field •	 Upwind leg •	 Crosswind leg on the upwind side of the field •	 Downwind leg •	 Base leg •	 Final approach  

This approach procedure provides the opportunity to see the  intended landing area from all sides. Use every opportunity  while flying this approach to inspect the landing area and  look for obstacles or other hazards.  [Figure 8-18]  

![](images/69c4544aeec4dbb0d1582325f3e5a8a74d59f27b14f0bb0c8bb9449536dba01f.jpg)  
Figure 8-18.  Off-field landing approach.  

Landing over an obstacle or a wire requires skill and  vigilance. The first goal in landing over an obstacle is to  clear the obstacle! Next, consider how the obstacle affects the  length of landing area that is actually going to be available for  touchdown, roll out, and stopping the glider. If an obstacle  is 50 feet high, the first 500 feet or so of the landing area  needs to be overflown during the descent to flare and land.  If the field selected has obstacles on the final approach path,  remember that the field must be long enough to accommodate  the descent to flare altitude after clearing the obstacle.  

Hold the glider off during the flare and touch down at the  lowest safe speed manageable. After touchdown, use the wheel  brake immediately and vigorously to stop the glider as soon as  possible. Aggressive braking helps prevent collision with small  stakes, ditches, rocks, or other obstacles that cannot easily be  seen, especially if the vegetation in the field is tall.  

# Afterlanding Off Field  Off-Field Landing Without Injury  

If uninjured, tend to personal needs and then secure the  glider. Make contact with the retrieval crew or emergency  crew as promptly as possible. If the wait is likely to be long,  use the daylight to remove all items necessary for darkness  and cold. It is worth remembering that even a normal  retrieval can take many hours if the landing was made in  difficult terrain or in an area served by relatively few roads.  If cellular service is available, use a cell phone to call 911  if you are concerned about personal safety. Glider pilots  should always consider alternate means of communication  to include satellite telephones and ham radios as cell phone  service is not always available. To help identify position,  relay the GPS coordinates, if available, to ease the job for the  retrieval crew or rescue personnel. It is a good idea to write  down the GPS coordinates if the GPS battery is exhausted  or if the GPS receiver shuts down for any reason. Use the  glider two-way radio to broadcast needs on the international  distress frequency 121.5 MHz. Many aircraft, including civil  airliners, routinely monitor this frequency. Their great height  gives the line-of-sight aviation transceiver tremendous range  when transmitting to, or receiving from, these high-altitude  aircraft. Calling other glider pilots in the area on the glider-to- glider radio frequency can hasten retrieval or rescue. Another  tool for pilots is the personal locator device offered by several  companies as a rescue device. These devices use the 406  MHz satellite signal, and global positioning system (GPS)  technology to accurately track and relay the pilot’s location  in the event of an off-field landing requiring assistance.  

Once contact has been made with outsiders to arrange for  retrieval, attend to minor items, such as collecting any special  tools that are needed for glider derigging or installing gust  locks on the glider’s flight controls.  

# Off-Field Landing With Injury  

If injured, tend to critical injuries first. At the first opportunity,  make contact with emergency response personnel, with other  aircraft, or any other source of identifiable assistance. Use  the glider radio, if operable, to broadcast a Mayday distress  call on emergency frequency  $121.5\,\mathrm{MHz}$  . Also, try any other  frequency likely to elicit a response. Some gliders have an  Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) on board. If the glider  is equipped with an ELT and assistance is needed, turn it  on. The ELT broadcasts continuous emergency signals on   $121.5\;\mathrm{MHz}$  . Search aircraft can hone in on this ELT signal  using radio equipment designed for search and rescue  (SAR). These SAR-equipped aircraft reduce the time spent  searching for the pilot’s exact location. To transmit a voice  message on an operable two-way radio at   $121.5\;\mathrm{MHz}$  , turn  the ELT switch to OFF for the voice message to be heard.  The newer ELTs, like the 406 MHz Emergency Position  Indicating Radio Beacons (EPIRBs), are becoming more  popular because of their substantial benefits. Only ATC  ground stations routinely monitor   $121.5\:\mathrm{MHz}$   anymore and  that is line-of-sight reception only. The newer EPIRBs have  stronger signals, transmit longer, and are monitored by the  satellite network. According to CFR part 91, gliders are  not airplanes and therefore old very high frequency (VHF)  ELTs are not required, which is why a EPIRB would make  a much better choice when flying a glider. If mobile (cell)  phone coverage is available, dial 911 to contact emergency  personnel. If possible, include a clear description of the  location. If the glider is in a precarious position, secure it, if  possible, but do not risk further personal injury in doing so.  If it is clearly unsafe to stay with the glider, move to a nearby  location for shelter but leave clear written instructions in a  prominent location in the glider detailing where to find you.  

It is best to stay with the glider if at all possible. The glider  bulk is likely to be much easier to locate from the air than  is an individual person. The pilot might obtain a measure of  protection from the elements by crawling into the fuselage or  crawling under a wing, or using the parachute canopy to rig  a makeshift tent around the glider structure. After attending  to medical needs and contacting rescue personnel, attend to  clothing, food, and water issues. The pilot should make every  attempt to conserve energy.  

# System and Equipment Malfunctions  

# Flight Instrument Malfunctions  

Instrument failures can result from careless maintenance  practices and from internal or external causes. An example  of careless maintenance is removal and replacement of the  airspeed indicator but failure to connect the instrument  correctly to pitot and static lines. A pitot tube clogged by  insects or water ingress is an example of an external cause  of instrument failure.  

Pilots should always be aware of the glider’s normal  attitudes for all flight regimes. Then, when presented with  an instrument failure or erroneous indication, the pilot has  a general sense of the glider’s normal attitude from outside  flying cues to make a safe return and landing. Judging the  altitude or airspeed of the glider without the guidance of  instruments should not constitute a panic in the cockpit as  many pilots can make precision approaches and landings  without the use of an altimeter. In fact, many older and vintage  gliders do not require an operational altimeter in the cockpit.  

# Airspeed Indicator Malfunctions  

If the airspeed indicator appears to be erratic or inaccurate, fly  the glider by pitch attitude. Keep the nose of the glider at the  proper pitch attitude for best glide or minimum sink airspeed.  Additional cues to airspeed include control “feel” and wind  noise. At very low airspeeds, control feel is very mushy and  wind noise is generally low. At higher airspeeds, control feel  is crisper and wind noise takes on a more insistent hissing  quality. The sound of the relative wind can be amplified and  made more useful in airspeed control by opening the sliding  window installed in the canopy and by opening the air vent  control. During the landing approach, maintain adequate  airspeed using cues other than the airspeed indicator. Fly  the approach with an adequate margin above stall airspeed.  If conditions are turbulent or the wind is gusty, additional  airspeed is necessary to penetrate the convection and to  ensure adequate control authority. If in doubt, it is better to be flying 10 knots faster than optimum airspeed than it is to be  10 knots slower.  

# Altimeter Malfunctions  

Altimeter failure may result from internal instrument failure  or from external causes, such as water ingress in the static  lines. Regardless of the cause, it is important to maintain  sufficient altitude to allow a safe glide to a suitable landing  area. During the approach to land without a functioning  altimeter, it is necessary to rely on perception of maintaining  a safe gliding angle to the target landing area. The primary  risk to safety is entering the approach from an altitude  that is lower than normal. It is better to enter the approach  from a normal height, or even from a higher-than-normal  height. During the approach, judge the angle to the target  area frequently. If the angle is too steep, apply spoilers/ dive brakes to steepen the descent path. If necessary, apply  a forward slip or turning slip to lose additional altitude. If  the approach angle is beginning to appear shallow, close the  spoilers/dive brakes and, if necessary, modify the approach  path to shorten the distance necessary to glide to make it to  the target landing area.  

Static line contamination affects both the altimeter and the  airspeed indicator. If it is suspected that either instrument  is malfunctioning because of static line contamination,  remember that the indications of the other instrument(s)  connected to the static line may also be incorrect. Use the  external cues described above to provide multiple cross- checks on the indications of all affected instruments. If in  doubt about the accuracy of any instrument, it is best to believe  the external cues and disregard the instrument indications.  After landing and prior to the next flight, have an aviation  maintenance professional evaluate the instrument system.  

It is essential that a glider pilot be familiar with the procedures  for making a safe approach without a functioning airspeed  indicator or altimeter. Being accompanied by a glider flight  instructor during the flight review provides an excellent  opportunity to review these procedures.  

# Variometer Malfunctions  

Variometer failure can make it difficult for the pilot to  locate and exploit sources of lift. If an airport is nearby,  a precautionary landing should be made so the source of  the problem can be uncovered and repaired. If no airport is  nearby, search for clues to sources of lift. Some clues may be  external, such as a rising smoke column, a cumulus cloud, a  dust devil, or a soaring bird. Other sources are internal, such  as the altimeter. Use the altimeter to gauge rate of climb or  descent in the absence of a functioning variometer. Tapping  the altimeter with the forefinger often overcomes internal  friction in the altimeter, allowing the hand to move upward  or downward. The direction of the movement gives an idea of  the rate of climb or descent over the last few seconds. When  lift is encountered, stay with it and climb.  

# Compass Malfunctions  

Compass failure is rare, but it does occur. If the compass  performs poorly or not at all, cross-check current position  with aeronautical charts and with electronic methods of  navigation, such as GPS, if available. The position of the  sun, combined with knowledge of the time of day, can help  with orientation also. Being familiar with section lines and  major roads often provides helpful cues to orientation and  the direction of flight.  

# Glider Canopy Malfunctions  

# Glider Canopy Opens Unexpectedly  

Canopy-related emergencies are often the result of pilot  error. The most likely cause is failure to lock the canopy in  the closed position prior to takeoff. Regardless of the cause,  if the canopy opens unexpectedly during any phase of flight,  the first duty is to fly the glider. It is important to maintain  adequate airspeed while selecting a suitable landing area.  

If the canopy opens while on aerotow, it is vital to maintain  a normal flying attitude to avoid jeopardizing the safety of  the glider occupants and the safety of the towplane pilot.  Only when the glider pilot is certain that glider control can  be maintained should any attention be devoted to trying to  close the canopy. If flying a two-seat glider with a passenger  on board, fly the glider while the other person attempts to  close and lock the canopy. If the canopy cannot be closed, the  glider may still be controllable. Drag is higher than normal;  when flying the approach, plan a steeper-than-normal descent  path. The best prevention against unexpected opening of the  canopy is proper use of the pretakeoff checklist.  

# Broken Glider Canopy  

If the canopy is damaged or breaks during flight, the best  response is to land as soon as practicable. Drag increases if  the canopy is shattered, so plan a steeper-than-normal descent  path during the approach.  

# Frosted Glider Canopy  

Extended flight at high altitude or in low ambient temperatures  may result in obstructed vision as moisture condenses as frost  on the inside of the canopy. Open the air vents and the side  window to ventilate the cabin and to evacuate moist air before  the moisture can condense on the canopy. Descend to lower  altitudes or warmer air to reduce the frost on the canopy.  Flight in direct sunlight helps diminish the frost on the canopy.  

# Water Ballast Malfunctions  

Water ballast systems are relatively simple and major failures  are not very common. Nevertheless, ballast system failures  can threaten the safety of flight. One example of ballast failure  is asymmetrical tank draining (one wing tank drains properly  but the other wing tank does not). The result is a wing-heavy  glider that may be very difficult to control during slow flight  and during the latter portion of the landing rollout. Another  example is leakage. Some water ballast systems drain into a  central pipe that empties through the landing gear wheel well.  If the drain connections from either wing leak significantly,  water from the tanks can collect in the fuselage. If the water  flows far forward or far aft in the fuselage, pitch control of  the glider may be severely degraded. Pitch control can be  augmented by flying at mid to high airspeeds, giving the  elevator more control authority to correct for the out-of- balance situation, and affording time to determine whether  the water can be evacuated from the fuselage. If pitch control  is dangerously degraded, abandoning the glider may be the  safest choice. The best prevention for water ballast problems  is regular maintenance and inspection combined with periodic  tests of the system and its components.  

# Retractable Landing Gear Malfunctions  

Landing gear difficulties can arise from several causes.  Landing gear failures arising from mechanical malfunction of  the gear extension mechanism generally cannot be resolved  during flight. Fly the approach at normal airspeed. If the  landing gear is not extended, the total drag of the glider is  less than it is normally during an approach with the landing  gear extended. It may be necessary to use more spoiler/dive  brake than normal during the approach. Try to land on the  smoothest surface available, preferably an area that has good  turf to help reduce the damage to the glider. The landing must  be under control and as soft as possible. Slightly above stall  speed soft touchdowns are preferable to full stall landings  resulting in hard landings. This helps avoid a tailwheel first  landing, and a hard touchdown of the glider onto the runway.  Avoiding the hard touchdown helps to avoid injury and lessen  damage to the glider components.  

The glider makes considerable noise as it slides along the  runway, and wingtip clearance above the ground is reduced.  Keep the wings level for as long as possible. Try to keep the  glider going as straight as possible using the rudder to guide  the glider. The primary goal is to avoid collision with objects  on the ground or along the runway border, including runway  lighting and signage. Accept the fact that minor skin damage  to the glider is inevitable if the gear cannot be extended and  locked. Concentrate on personal safety during the approach  and landing. Any damage to the glider can be repaired after  an injury-free landing.  

# Primary Flight Control Systems  

Failure of any primary flight control system presents a serious  threat to safety. The most frequent cause of control system  failure is incomplete assembly of the glider in preparation  for flight. To avoid this, use a written checklist to guide each  assembly operation and inspect every connection and safety  pin thoroughly. Do not allow interruptions during assembly.  If interruption is unavoidable, start the checklist again from  the very beginning. Perform a positive control check with  the help of a knowledgeable assistant. Do not assume that  any flight surface and flight control is properly installed and  connected during the post-assembly inspection. Instead,  assume that every connection is suspect. Inspect and test until  certain that every component is ready for flight.  

# Elevator Malfunctions  

The most serious control system malfunction is a failure of  the elevator flight control. Causes of elevator flight control  failure include the following:  

•	 An improper connection of the elevator control circuit  during assembly. •	 An elevator control lock that was not removed before  flight. •	 Separation of the elevator gap seal tape.  

•	 Interference of a foreign object with free and full travel  of the control stick or elevator circuit. •	 A lap belt or shoulder harness in the back seat that  was used to secure the control stick and not removed  prior to flight. •	 A structural failure of the glider due to overstressing  or flutter.  

To avoid a failure, ensure that control locks are removed  prior to flight, that all flight control connections have been  completed properly and inspected, and that all safety pins have  been installed and latched properly. Ensure that a positive  control check against applied resistance has been performed.  

If the elevator irregularity or failure is detected early in the  takeoff roll, release the towline (or reduce power to idle),  maneuver the glider to avoid obstacles, and use the brakes  firmly to stop the glider as soon as possible. If the elevator  control irregularity or failure is not noticed until after takeoff,  a series of complicated decisions must be made quickly. If  the glider is close to the ground and has a flat or slightly  nose-low pitch attitude, releasing the towline (or reducing  power to zero) is the best choice. If this is an aerotow launch,  consider the effect the glider has on the safety of the tow pilot.  If there is sufficient elevator control during climb, then it is  probably best to stay with the launch and achieve as high an  altitude as possible. High altitude gives more time to abandon  the glider and deploy a parachute, if worn.  

If the decision is to stay with the glider and continue the  climb, experiment with the effect of other flight controls on  the pitch attitude of the glider. These include the effects of  various wing flap settings, spoilers/dive brakes, elevator trim  system, and raising or lowering the landing gear. If flying a  self-launching glider, experiment with the effect of power  settings on pitch attitude.  

If aileron control is functioning, bank the glider and use  the rudder to moderate the attitude of the nose relative to  the horizon. When the desired pitch attitude is approached,  adjust the bank angle to maintain the desired pitch attitude.  Forward slips may have a predictable effect on pitch attitude  and can be used to moderate it. Usually, a combination of  these techniques is necessary to regain some control of pitch  attitude. While these techniques may be a poor substitute for  the glider elevator itself, they are better than nothing. If an  altitude sufficient to permit bailing out and using a parachute  is achieved, chances of survival are good because parachute  failures are exceedingly rare.  

Elevator gap seal tape, if in poor condition, can degrade  elevator responsiveness. If the adhesive that bonds the gap  seal leading edge to the horizontal stabilizer begins to fail, the  leading edge of the gap seal may be lifted up by the relative  wind. This provides, in effect, a small spoiler that disturbs the  airflow over the elevator just aft of the lifted seal. Elevator  blanking that occurs across a substantial portion of the span  of the elevator seriously degrades pitch attitude control. In  extreme cases, elevator authority may be compromised so  drastically that the glider elevator is useless.  

The pilot may be forced to resort to alternate methods to  control pitch attitude as described above. Bailing out may be  the safest alternative. Inspection of the gap seal bonds for all  flight control surfaces prior to flight is the best prevention.  

# Aileron Malfunctions  

Aileron failures can cause serious control problems. Causes  of aileron failure include:  

•	 Improper connection of the aileron control circuit  during assembly. •	 Aileron control lock that was not removed before flight. •	 Separation of the aileron gap seal tape. •	 Interference of a foreign object with free and full travel  of the control stick or aileron circuit. •	 Seat belt or shoulder harness in the back seat that was  used to secure the control stick and not removed prior  to flight. •	 Structural failure and/or aileron flutter.  

These failures can sometimes be counteracted successfully,  partly because there are two ailerons. If one aileron is  disconnected or locked by an external control lock, the  degree of motion still available in the other aileron may exert  some influence on bank angle control. Use whatever degree  of aileron is available to maintain control of the glider. The  glider may be less difficult to control at medium to high  airspeeds than at low airspeeds.  

If the ailerons are not functioning adequately and roll control  is compromised, the secondary effect of the rudder can be used  to make gentle adjustments in the bank angle so long as a safe  margin above stall speed is maintained. The primary effect  of the rudder is to yaw the glider. The secondary effect of the  rudder is subtler and takes longer to assert itself. In wings-level  flight, if left rudder is applied, the nose yaws to the left. If  the pressure is held, the wings begin a gentle bank to the left.  If right rudder pressure is held and applied, the glider yaws  to the right, then begins to bank to the right. This secondary  banking effect by the rudder is useful if the pilot must resort  to using the rudder to bank the glider wings. The secondary  effect of the rudder works best when the wings are level or  held in a very shallow bank, and is enhanced at medium to  high airspeeds. Try to keep all banks very shallow. If the  bank angle becomes excessive, it is difficult or impossible to  recover to wings-level flight using the rudder alone. If the bank  is becoming too steep, use any aileron influence available, as  well as all available rudder to bring the wings back to level. If  a parachute is available and the glider becomes uncontrollable  at low airspeed, the best chance to escape serious injury may  be to bail out of the glider from a safe altitude.  

# Rudder Malfunctions  

Rudder failure is extremely rare because removing and  installing the vertical fin/rudder combination is not part of the  normal sequence of rigging and de-rigging the glider (as it is  for the horizontal stabilizer/elevator and for the wing/aileron  combinations). Poor directional control is so obvious to the  pilot from the very beginning of the launch that, if rudder  malfunction is suspected, the launch can be aborted early.  

Rudder malfunctions are most likely to occur after failure  to remove the rudder control lock prior to flight or when an  unsecured object in the cockpit interferes with the free and full  travel of the rudder pedals. Preflight preparation must include  removal of all flight control locks and safe stowage of all  items on board. The pretakeoff checklist includes checking all  primary flight controls for correct, full travel prior to launch.  

Although rudder failure is quite rare, the consequences are  serious. If a control lock causes the problem, it is possible to  control the glider airspeed and bank attitude, but directional  control is compromised due to limited rudder movement. In  the air, some degree of directional control can be obtained by  using the adverse yaw effect of the ailerons to yaw the glider.  During rollout from an aborted launch or during landing  rollout, directional control can sometimes be obtained by  deliberately grounding the wingtip toward the direction of  desired yaw. Putting the wingtip on the ground for a fraction  of a second causes a slight yaw in that direction; holding the  wingtip firmly on the ground usually causes a vigorous yaw  or ground loop in the direction of the grounded wingtip.  

Careless stowage of cockpit equipment can result in rudder  pedal interference at any time during a flight. During flight,  if an object is interfering with or jamming the rudder pedals,  attempt to remove it. If removal is not possible, attempt to  deform, crush, or dislodge the object by applying force on the  rudder pedals. It also may be possible to dislodge the object  by varying the load factor, but ensure that dislodging the  object does not result in its lodging in a worse place where  it could jam the elevator or aileron controls. If the object  cannot be retrieved and stowed, a precautionary landing  may be required.  

Commonly misplaced objects that can cause flight control  interference include:  

•	 Water bottles, •	 Cameras, •	 Electronic computers, •	 Containers of food and similar items, •	 Clothing, and •	 Sunglasses.  

Control these items by proper planning and good cockpit  discipline.  

# Secondary Flight Controls Systems  

Secondary flight control systems include the elevator trim  system, wing flaps, and spoilers/dive brakes. Problems with  any of these systems can be just as serious as problems with  primary controls.  

# Elevator Trim Malfunctions  

Compensating for a malfunctioning elevator trim system is  usually as simple as applying pressure on the control stick  to maintain the desired pitch attitude, then bringing the flight  to safe conclusion. Inspect and repair the trim system prior  to the next flight.  

# Spoiler/Dive Brake Malfunctions  

Spoiler/dive brake system failures can arise from rigging  errors or omissions, environmental factors, and mechanical  failures. Interruptions or distractions during glider assembly  can result in failure to properly connect control rods to one  or both spoilers/dive brakes. Proper use of a comprehensive  checklist reduces the likelihood of assembly errors. If  neither of these spoilers/dive brakes is connected, then one  or both of the spoilers/dive brakes may deploy at any time  and retraction becomes impossible. This is a very hazardous  situation for several reasons. One reason is that the spoilers/ dive brakes are likely to deploy during the launch or the  climb, causing a launch emergency and a possible tow failure  incident. Another reason is that the spoilers/dive brakes might  deploy asymmetrically: one spoiler/dive brake retracted  and the other spoiler/dive brake extended, resulting in yaw  and  roll tendencies that do not arise when the spoilers/dive  brakes deploy symmetrically. A pilot expecting a smooth  ,symmetrical deployment would be faced with a control issue  that compromises flight safety. Finally, it is not possible to  correct the situation by retracting the spoiler/dive brake(s)  because the failure to connect the controls properly usually  means that pilot control of the spoiler/dive brake has been lost.  

If asymmetrical spoiler/dive brake extension occurs and  the extended spoiler/dive brake cannot be retracted, several  choices must be made. Roll and yaw tendencies due to  asymmetry must be overcome or eliminated. One way to  solve this problem is to deploy the other spoiler/dive brake  to restore the symmetry. The advantages include immediate  relief from yaw and roll tendencies and protection against  stalling with one spoiler/dive brake extended and the other  retracted, which could result in a spin. The disadvantage of  deploying the other spoiler/dive brake is that the glide ratio  is reduced. If the spoiler/dive brake asymmetry arises during  launch or climb, the best choice is to abort the launch, extend  the other spoiler/dive brakes to relieve the asymmetry, and  make a precautionary or emergency landing.  

Environmental factors include low temperature or icing  during long, high altitude flights, which may occur during a  mountain wave flight. Low temperature causes contraction  of all glider components. If the contraction is uneven, the  spoilers/dive brakes may bind and be difficult or impossible to  deploy. Icing can also interfere with operation of the spoilers/ dive brakes. High temperature, on the other hand, causes all  glider components to expand. If the expansion is uneven,  the spoilers/dive brakes may bind in the closed position.  This is most likely to occur while the glider is parked on the  ground in direct summer sunlight. The heating can be very  intense, particularly for a glider with wings painted a color  other than reflective white.  

Mechanical failures can cause asymmetrical spoiler/dive brake  extension. For example, the spoiler/dive brake extend normally  during the prelanding checklist but only one spoiler/dive brake  retracts on command. The other spoiler/dive brake remains  extended, due perhaps to a broken weld in the spoiler/dive  brake actuator mechanism, a defective control connector, or  other mechanical failure. The glider yaws and banks toward  the wing with the extended spoiler/dive brake. Aileron and  rudder are required to counteract these tendencies. To eliminate  any possibility of entering a stall/spin, maintain a safe margin  above stall airspeed. If the decision to deploy the other spoiler/ dive brake is made to relieve the asymmetry, controlling the  glider becomes much easier but gliding range is reduced due to  the additional drag of the second spoiler/dive brake. This may  be a significant concern if the terrain is not ideal for landing the  glider. Nevertheless, it is better to make a controlled landing,  even in less than ideal terrain, than it is to stall or spin.  

# Miscellaneous Flight System  Malfunctions  

# Towhook Malfunctions  

Towhooks can malfunction as can any other mechanical  device. Failure modes include uncommanded towline release  and failure to release on command. Pilots must be prepared  to abort any towed launch, whether ground or aerotow  launch, at any time. Uncommanded towline release must be  anticipated prior to every launch. Assess the wind and the  airport environment, and then form an emergency plan prior  to launch. If the towhook fails to release on command, try to  release the towline again after removing tension from the line.  Pull the release handle multiple times under varying conditions  of towline tension. If the towline still cannot release, alert the  towpilot and follow the emergency procedures described in  Chapter 7, Flight Maneuvers and Traffic Patterns.  

# Oxygen System Malfunctions  

Oxygen is essential for flight safety at high altitude. If there  is a suspected or detected failure in any component of the  oxygen system, descend immediately to an altitude at which  supplemental oxygen is not essential for continued safe  flight. Remember, the first sign of oxygen deprivation is a  sensation of apparent well-being. Problem-solving capability  is diminished. If the pilot has been deprived of sufficient  oxygen, even for a short interval, critical thinking capability  has been compromised. Do not be lulled into thinking that  the flight can safely continue at high altitude. Descend  immediately and breathe normally at these lower altitudes for  a time to restore critical oxygen to the bloodstream. Try to  avoid hyperventilation, which prolongs the diminished critical  thinking capability. Give enough time to recover critical  thinking capability before attempting an approach and landing.  

# Drogue Chute Malfunctions  

Some gliders are equipped with a drogue chute to add drag  during the approach to land. This drag supplements the drag  provided by the spoilers/dive brakes. The drogue chute is  packed and stowed in the aft tip (tail cone) of the fuselage or  in a special compartment in the base of the rudder. Drogue  chutes are very effective when deployed properly and make  steep approaches possible. The drogue chute is deployed and  jettisoned on pilot command, such as would be necessary if  the drag of the glider was so great that the glider would not  otherwise have the range to make it to the spot of intended  landing. There are several failure modes for drogue chutes.  If it deploys accidentally or inadvertently during the launch,  the rate of climb seriously degrades and it must be jettisoned.  During the approach to land, an improperly packed or damp  drogue chute may fail to deploy on command. If this happens,  use the rudder to sideslip for a moment, or use the rudder  to yaw the tail back and forth. Make certain to attain safe  flying speed before attempting the slip or yawing motion.  Either technique increases the drag force on the drogue chute  compartment that pulls the parachute out of the compartment.  

If neither technique deploys the drogue chute, the drogue  canopy may deploy at a later time during the approach  without further control input from the pilot. This results in  a considerable increase in drag. If this happens, be prepared  to jettison the drogue chute immediately if sufficient altitude  to glide to the intended landing spot has not been reached.  

Another possible malfunction is failure of the drogue chute  to inflate fully. If this happens, the canopy “streams” like  a twisting ribbon of nylon, providing only a fraction of the  drag that would occur if the canopy had fully inflated. Full  inflation is unlikely after streaming occurs, but if it does  occur, drag increases substantially. It is much better to fly  with a known drag configuration and adjust for it rather  than be faced with a substantially increased drag coefficient  at a place and time where a safe landing is no longer  possible. If in doubt regarding the degree of deployment  of the drogue chute, the safest option may be to jettison  the drogue. Regardless of the malfunction type, the pilot  should review approach and landing options for the drogue  chute conditions.  

# Self-Launching Gliders  

In addition to the standard flight control systems found on  all gliders, self-launching gliders have multiple systems to  support flight under power. These systems may include but  are not limited to the following:  

•	 Fuel tanks, lines, and pumps •	 Engine and/or propeller extension and retraction  systems •	 Electrical system including engine starter system •	 Lubricating oil system •	 Engine cooling system •	 Engine throttle controls •	 Propeller blade pitch controls •	 Engine monitoring instruments and systems  

The complexity of these systems demands thorough  familiarity with the GFM/POH for the self-launching glider  being flown. Any malfunction of these systems can make it  impossible to resume powered flight.  

# Self-Launching/Sustainer Glider Engine Failure  During Takeoff or Climb  

Engine failures are the most obvious source of equipment  malfunction in self-launching gliders. Engine failures can be  subtle (a very slight power loss at full throttle) or catastrophic  and sudden (engine crankshaft failing during a full-power  takeoff). High on the list of possible causes of power  problems are fuel contamination and exhaustion.  

To provide adequate power, the engine system must have fuel  and ignition, as well as adequate cooling and lubrication. Full  power operation is compromised if any of these requirements  is not satisfied. Monitor the engine temperature, oil pressure,  fuel pressure, and revolutions per minute (rpm) carefully to  ensure engine performance is not compromised. Warning  signs of impending difficulty include excessively high  engine temperatures, abnormal engine oil temperatures, low  oil pressure, low rpm despite high throttle settings, low fuel  pressure, and erratic engine operation (surging, backfiring, and  missing). Abnormal engine performance may be a precursor to  complete engine failure. Even if total engine failure does not  occur, operation with an engine that cannot produce full power  translates into an inability to climb or perhaps an inability  to hold altitude despite application of full throttle. The best  course of action, if airborne, is to make a precautionary  landing first and then discover the source of the trouble.  

Regardless of the type of engine failure, the pilot’s first  responsibility is to maintain flying airspeed and adequate  control of the glider. If power failure occurs, lower the nose  as necessary to maintain adequate airspeed. Pilots flying  self-launching gliders with a pod-mounted external engine  above the fuselage need to lower the nose much more  aggressively in the event of total power loss than those with  an engine mounted in the nose. In the former, the thrust of  the engine during full power operations tends to provide a  nose-down pitching moment. If power fails, the nose-down  pitching moment disappears and is replaced by a nose-up  pitching moment due to the substantial parasite drag of the  engine pod high above the longitudinal axis of the fuselage.  Considerable forward motion on the control stick may be  required to maintain flying airspeed. If altitude is low, there  is not enough time to stow the engine and reduce the drag  that it creates. Land the glider with the engine extended.  Glide ratio in this configuration is poor due to the drag of the  extended engine and propeller. The authoritative source for  information regarding the correct sequence of pilot actions  in the event of power failure is contained in the GFM/POH.  The pilot must be thoroughly familiar with its contents to  operate a self-launching glider safely.  

If the power failure occurs during launch or climb, time to  maneuver may be limited. Concentrate on flying the glider  and selecting a suitable landing area. Remember that the  high drag configuration of the glider may limit the distance  of the glide without power. Keep turns to a minimum and  land the glider as safely as possible. Do not try to restart the  engine while at very low altitude because it distracts from the  primary task of maintaining flying airspeed and making a safe  precautionary landing. Even if power in the engine system  were restored, chances are that full power is not available. The  problem that caused the power interruption in the first place  is not likely to solve itself while trying to maneuver from  low altitude and climb out under full power. If the problem  recurs, as it is likely to do, the pilot may place the glider low  over unlandable terrain with limited gliding range and little  or no engine power to continue the flight. Even if the engine  continues to provide limited power, flight with partial power  may quickly put the glider in a position in which the pilot is  unable to clear obstacles, such as wires, poles, hangars, or  nearby terrain. If a full power takeoff or climb is interrupted  by power loss, it is best to make a precautionary landing. The  pilot can sort out the power system problems after returning  safely to the ground.  

# Inability to Restart a Self-Launching/Sustainer  Glider Engine While Airborne  

Power loss during takeoff roll or climb are serious problems,  but they are not the only types of problems that may confront  the pilot of a self-launching glider. Other engine failures  include an engine that refuses to start in response to airborne  start attempts. This is a serious problem if the terrain below  is unsuitable for a safe off-field landing.  

One of the great advantages of the self-launching glider is  having the option to terminate a soaring flight by starting  the engine and flying to an airport/gliderport for landing.  Nearly all self-launching gliders have a procedure designed  to start the engine while airborne. This procedure would be  most valuable during a soaring flight with engine off during  which the soaring conditions have weakened. The prospect  of starting the engine and flying home safely is ideal under  such conditions.  

As a precaution, an airborne engine start should be attempted  at an altitude high enough that, if a malfunction occurs, there  is sufficient time to take corrective action. If the engine fails  to start promptly, or fails to start at all, there may be little  time to plan for a safe landing. If there is no landable area  below, then failure to start the engine results in an emergency  off-field landing in unsuitable terrain. Glider damage and  personal injury may result. To avoid these dangers, self- launching glider pilots should never allow themselves to  get into a situation that can only be resolved by starting the  engine and flying up and away. It is best to keep a landable  field always within easy gliding range.  

There are many reasons that a self-launching glider engine  may fail to start or fail to provide full power in response to  efforts to resume full power operations while airborne. These  include lack of fuel or ignition, low engine temperature due  to cold soak, low battery output due to low temperatures or  battery exhaustion, fuel vapor lock, lack of propeller response  to blade pitch controls, and other factors. It is important for  the pilot to have an emergency plan in the event that full  engine power is not available during any phase of flight.  

# Self-Launching Glider Propeller Malfunctions  

Propeller failures include propeller damage and disintegration,  propeller drive belt or drive gear failure, or failure of the  variable blade pitch control system. To perform an air-driven  engine restart, for example, many self-launching gliders  require that the propeller blades be placed in a particular  blade pitch position. If the propeller blades cannot be properly  adjusted, then the propeller will not deliver enough torque to  start the engine. The result is a failure to obtain an air-driven  engine start.  

# Self-Launching Glider Electrical System  Malfunctions  

An electrical system failure in a self-launching glider may  make it impossible to control the propeller pitch if the  propeller is electrically controlled. It may also result in the  inability to deploy a pod engine successfully for an air restart  attempt. Self-launching gliders that require a functioning  electric starter for an air restart are unable to resume flight  under power. If an airport is within gliding range, an on- airport precautionary landing can be made. If there is no  airport within gliding range and the flight can be safely  continued without electrical power, the pilot may be able to  soar to the vicinity of an airport and land safely. If no airport  is within gliding range and flight cannot be sustained without  power, an emergency off-airport landing has to be made.  

Some self-launching gliders are occasionally used for  night flight, cruising under power. All night flights must be  conducted in accordance with FAA regulation and the glider  must have the appropriate aeronautical lighting required for  night time operations (14 CFR part 91, section 91.209). If  carrying a passenger(s), the pilot must be qualified to operate  the glider at night in accordance with 14 CFR part  61,  section 61.57(b).  

If an electrical system failure occurs during night operations,  pilots of nearby aircraft are not able to see the self-launching  glider due to the extinguished position lights. Inside  the cockpit, it is difficult or impossible to see the flight  instruments or electrical circuit breakers. According to 14  CFR part 135, section 135.159(f), and part 121, section  121.549(b), the FAA requires that commercial and airline  pilots have a flashlight “having at least two size D cells or  equivalent” for such an emergency. It makes good practical  sense for other pilots to follow the same rules.  

If smoke or the smell of smoke is present, make no attempt  to reset any circuit breakers. In accordance with CE-10- 11R, Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin, dated  January 14, 2010, and available for download at http://rgl. faa.gov/Regulatory and Guidance Library/rgSAIB.nsf/ (LookupSAIBs)/CE-10-11R1?OpenDocument, the best  and safest practice is to not reset circuit breakers in the  air unless absolutely necessary for safe flight. Resetting a  circuit breaker may result in a greater overload and possible  fire.  [Figure 8-19]  Head directly for the nearest airport and  prepare for a precautionary landing there. Follow nighttime  procedures and requirements. The aviation transceiver  installed in the instrument panel may not function if electrical  failure is total, so it is a good idea to have a portable battery- operated aviation two-way radio onboard for use in such an  emergency. It may be necessary to receive landing instruction  by air traffic control (ATC) light-signal. Pilot should  review 14 CFR part 91, section 125, and the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM) section 4-2-13, Traffic Control  Light Signals, for the proper response.  

# In-flight Fire  

An in-flight fire is the most serious emergency a pilot can  encounter. If a fire has ignited, or if there is a smell of smoke  or any similar smell, do everything possible to reduce the  possibilities that the fire spreads and land as soon as possible.  The self-launching glider GFM/POH is the authoritative  source for emergency response to suspected in-flight fire.  The necessary procedures are:  

•	 Reduce throttle to idle, •	 Shut off fuel valves, •	 Shut off engine ignition, •	 Land immediately and stop as quickly as possible, and •	 Evacuate the self-launching glider immediately.  

![](images/b83790aba79c5039da821c885f67325eec97eed7d47f72e8b5458991d9e51c56.jpg)  

After landing, distance yourself from the glider and try to stay  upwind to avoid the harmful fumes. Keep onlookers away  from the glider as well. The principal danger after evacuating  the glider is fuel ignition and explosion, with the potential to  injure personnel at a considerable distance from the glider.  

CAUTION: Modern gliders are composed of composite  materials and resins that can produce very poisonous fumes.  The glider pilot should do whatever is necessary to avoid  the fumes to include jettisoning of the canopy, which allows  breathable air in and elimination of fumes from the cockpit.  This same modern construction also means a fire can spread  very quickly. A quick landing or abandoning the glider for a  parachute landing may be the only option for the pilot. If the  fire is spreading to the wings, bailout at a safe altitude may be  the safest choice if the airframe will not last until the landing.  

# Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear  

Emergency equipment and survival gear is essential for safety  of flight for all soaring flights.  

# Survival Gear Checklists  

Checklists help the pilot to assemble the necessary equipment  in an orderly manner. The essentials for survival include  reliable and usable supplies of water, food, and air or oxygen.  Maintenance of an acceptable body temperature, which is  difficult to manage in extreme cold or extreme heat, is also  important. Blankets and appropriate seasonal clothing help  to ensure safe body temperatures.  

# Food and Water  

An adequate supply of water and food (especially high- energy foods such as energy bars, granolas, and dried fruits)  are of utmost importance during cross-country flight. Water  from ballast tanks can be used in an emergency if free of  contaminants, such as antifreeze. Water and food should be  available and easily accessible during the entire flight.  

# Clothing  

Pilots also need seasonal clothing that is appropriate to the  local environment, including hat or cap, shirts, sweaters,  

Figure 8-19.  Self-launching glider circuit breakers.  

pants, socks, walking shoes, space blanket, and gloves or  mittens. Layered clothing provides flexibility to meet the  demands of the environment. Desert areas may be very hot  in the day and very cold at night. Prolonged exposure to  either condition can be debilitating. Layered clothing traps  air between layers, increasing heat retention. The parachute  canopy can be used as an effective layered garment when  wrapped around the body to conserve body heat or to  provide relief from excessive sunlight. Eye protection, such  as sunglasses, is more than welcome if conditions during  the day are bright, as they often are on good soaring days.  

# Communication  

Communication can be electronic, visual, or audible.  Radios, telephones, and cell phones are electronic methods.  Signal mirrors, flashlight or light beacons at night, signal  fire flames at night, signal smoke during daylight hours,  signal flares, and prominent parachute canopy displays are  visual methods. Shouting and other noisemaking activities  are audible methods but usually have very limited range. A  whistle provides a good method for making sound.  

Coin, cash, or credit cards are often necessary to operate  pay phones. Charged batteries are required to operate cell  phones, two-way radios, and emergency locator transmitters.  Batteries are also necessary to operate flashlights or position  lights on the glider for signal purposes. A list of useful  telephone numbers aids rapid communication. The aviation  transceiver can be tuned to broadcast and receive on the  emergency frequency   $121.5~\mathrm{MHz}$   or any other useable  frequency that elicits a response. The ELT can be used to  provide a continuous signal on  $121.5\:\mathrm{MHz}$   and/or the newer  406 MHz SAR system. A   $406\ \mathrm{MHz}$   beacon on a downed  aircraft activates either automatically or manually. The ELT  transmits a digital identification code to the first satellite  that comes into range. The satellites receive the signal and  relay it to a ground station. If there is no ground station in  view, the satellite records the digital signal in its onboard  memory and downloads it to the next ground station. The  ground station processor measures the Doppler shift of the  signal and calculates its position; this calculation is usually  accurate to within 1.5 nautical miles on the first satellite pass  and is refined further with each pass. If the beacon has an  integrated GPS or is connected into the onboard NAVCOM,  the position is imbedded into the initial digital data stream.  

After the ground station has completed processing, it  transmits the identification and position to the United  States Mission Control Center (USMCC). The USMCC  attaches the information contained in the  $406\;\mathrm{MHz}$   beacon  registration database for that particular ELT and generates  an alert message. If the location lies within the continental  U.S., the alert is sent to the Air Force Rescue Coordination  Center (AFRCC) at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The  AFRCC then takes the registration data and attempts to  ascertain the aircraft’s disposition. By calling the emergency  contact numbers, or by calling flight service stations with the  N-number, they can quickly determine whether or not the  aircraft is safe on the ground.  

Since most activations are false alarms, the ability to resolve  them over the phone saves the AFRCC (i.e., U.S. taxpayers)  millions of dollars. More importantly, it saves SAR assets  for actual emergencies. If the AFRCC in unable to verify  the aircraft is safe on the ground, they launch a Search and  Rescue mission. This normally involves assigning the search  to the USAF Auxiliary Civil Air Patrol and may include  requesting assistance from the local SAR responders or law  enforcement personnel.  

The unique digital code of each   $406\ \mathrm{MHz}$   beacon allows it  to be associated with a particular aircraft. The registration  contains information, such as tail number, home airport,  type and color of aircraft, and several emergency points of  contact. This provides rapid access to flight plans and other  vital information. This can speed the search effort and can  be the difference between life and death.  

The parachute canopy and case can be employed to lay out  a prominent marker to aid recognition from the air by other  aircraft. Matches and a combustible material can provide  flame for visibility by night and provide smoke that may be  seen during daylight hours.  

# Navigation Equipment  

Aviation charts help to navigate during flight and help  pinpoint the location when an off-airport landing is made.  Sectional charts have the most useful scale for cross-country  soaring flights. Local road maps (with labeled roads) should  be carried in the glider during all cross-country flights.  Local road maps make it much easier to give directions to  the ground crew, allowing them to arrive as promptly as  possible. GPS coordinates also help the ground crew if they  are equipped with a GPS receiver and appropriate charts and  maps. Detailed GPS maps are commercially available and  make GPS navigation by land easier for the ground crew.  

# Medical Equipment  

Compact, commercially made medical or first aid kits are  widely available. These kits routinely include bandages,  medical tape, disinfectants, a tourniquet, matches, a knife  or scissors, bug and snake repellent, and other useful items.  Ensure that the kit contains medical items suitable to the  environment in which the glider is operating. Stow the kit so  it is secure from inflight turbulence but would be accessible to  injured occupant(s)after an emergency landing, even if injured.  

# Stowage  

Stowing equipment properly means securing all equipment to  protect occupants and ensuring integrity of all flight controls  and glider system controls. Items carried on board must be  secured even in the event that severe inflight turbulence is  encountered. Items must also remain secured in the event of a  hard or off-field landing. No item carried in the glider should  have any chance of becoming loose in flight to interfere with  the flight controls. Stowed objects should be adequately  secured to prevent movement during a hard landing.  

# Parachute  

The parachute should be clean, dry, and stored in a cool place  when not in use. It is imperative to keep the parachute free of  contaminants to ensure the integrity the parachutes material. The  parachute must have been inspected and repacked within the  allowable time frame. The pilot is responsible for ensuring that  the parachute meets with the required FAA inspection criteria.  

# Accident Prevention  

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) generates  accident reports anytime a reportable soaring accident  occurs. Any interested person can visit the website directly  at www.ntsb.gov and look at the NTSB query database page  to view summaries of both glider and towplane accidents.  It is very important for all pilots to educate themselves on  past accidents. In particular, they should look at the cause  of the accident and how it could have been prevented. All  too often accidents are caused from pilot error or equipment  failure that, if trained and educated properly, the pilot could  have reacted differently and saved a life, usually their own.  The Soaring Safety Foundation is an excellent resource for  pilots to educate themselves on glider safety and the website  provides pilots with lessons learned information, as well  as on-line safety learning. The Soaring Safety Foundation  website is www.soaringsafety.org.  

# Oxygen System Malfunctions  

Oxygen is essential for flight safety at high altitude. If there  is a suspected or detected failure in any component of the  oxygen system, descend immediately to an altitude where  supplemental oxygen is not essential for continued safe flight.  Remember, the first sign of oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) is a  sensation of apparent well-being. Problem-solving capability  is diminished. If the pilot has been deprived of sufficient  oxygen, even for a short interval, critical thinking capability  has been compromised. Do not be lulled into thinking that  the flight can safely continue at high altitude. Descend  immediately and breathe normally at these lower altitudes  for a time to restore critical oxygen to the bloodstream.  Try to avoid hyperventilation, which prolongs diminished  critical thinking capability. Give enough time to recover  critical thinking capability before attempting an approach  and landing.  

For high altitude flights, such as a wave flight, the oxygen  bailout bottle becomes a necessity. It should be in good  condition and be within easy reach if a high altitude escape  becomes necessary from the glider. Pilots need to be properly  trained for an event requiring abandonment of a glider at a  very high altitude, the use of oxygen, and proper use of a  parachute at high altitudes.  

# Soaring Weather  

# Introduction  

Glider pilots face a multitude of decisions, starting with the  decision to take to the air. Pilots must determine if weather  conditions are safe, and if current conditions support a  soaring flight. Gliders, being powered by gravity, are always  sinking through the air. Therefore, glider pilots must seek  air that rises faster than the sink rate of the glider to enable  prolonged flight. Glider pilots refer to rising air as lift, not  to be confused with the lift created by the wing.  

# The Atmosphere  

The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding the  earth. Without it, there would be no weather (wind, clouds,  precipitation) or protection from the sun’s rays. Though this  protective envelope is essential to life, it is extraordinarily  thin. When compared to the radius of the earth, 3,438 nautical  miles (NM), the vertical limit of the atmosphere represents a  very small distance. Although there is no specific upper limit  to the atmosphere—it simply thins to a point where it fades  away into space—the layers up to approximately 164,000 feet  (about 27 NM) contain 99.9 percent of atmospheric mass.  At that altitude, the atmospheric density is approximately  one-thousandth the density of that at sea level.  [Figure 9-1]  

![](images/a9602b2cccdf26da4ecc59bdf52c9e57207fe21de74fc1cc09ceef1c44a05130.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.  Atmospheric mass by altitude.  

# Composition  

The earth’s atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gases,  with small amounts of water, ice, and other particles. Two  gases, nitrogen  $(\mathbf{N}_{2})$   and oxygen  $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$  , comprise approximately  99 percent of the gaseous content of the atmosphere; the other  one percent is composed of various trace gases. Nitrogen  and oxygen are both considered permanent gases, meaning  their proportions remain the same to approximately 260,000  feet. Water vapor   $\mathrm{(H}_{2}\mathrm{O)}$  , on the other hand, is considered  a variable gas. Therefore, the amount of water in the  atmosphere depends on the location and the source of the  air. For example, the water vapor content over tropical areas  and oceans accounts for as much as 4 percent of the gases  displacing nitrogen and oxygen. Conversely, the atmosphere  over deserts and at high altitudes exhibits less than 1 percent  of the water vapor content.  [Figure 9-2]  

Although water vapor exists in the atmosphere in small  amounts as compared to nitrogen and oxygen, it has a  significant impact on the production of weather. This is  because it exists in two other physical states: liquid (water)  and solid (ice). These two states of water contribute to the  formation of clouds, precipitation, fog, and icing, all of which  are important to aviation weather.  

# Properties  

The state of the atmosphere is defined by fundamental  variables, namely temperature, density, and pressure. These  variables change over time and, combined with vertical and  horizontal differences, lead to daily weather conditions.  

# Temperature  

The temperature of a gas is the measure of the average  kinetic energy of the molecules of that gas. Fast-moving  molecules are indicative of high kinetic energy and warmer  temperatures. Conversely, slow-moving molecules reflect  lower kinetic energy and lower temperatures. Air temperature  is commonly thought of in terms of whether it feels hot or  cold. For quantitative measurements, the Celsius   $(^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$   scale  is used in aviation, although the Fahrenheit   $(^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   scale is still  used in some applications.  

# Density  

The density of any given gas is the total mass of molecules  in a specified volume, expressed in units of mass per volume.  Low air density means a smaller number of air molecules in a  specified volume while high air density means a greater number  of air molecules in the same volume. Air density affects aircraft  performance, as noted in Chapter 5, Glider Performance.  

# Pressure  

Molecules in a given volume of air not only possess a certain  kinetic energy and density, but they also exert force. The  force per unit area defines pressure. At the earth’s surface,  the pressure exerted by the atmosphere is due to its weight.  Therefore, pressure is measured in terms of weight per area.  For example, atmospheric pressure is measured in pounds  per square inch   $\mathrm{(lb/in^{2})}$  . From the outer atmosphere to sea  level, a typical value of atmospheric pressure is   $14.7\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2}$  

![](images/05953a1f68ed1bd17874e3d381ad68da563c50df2fc1d42263a293dd6c8584c5.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.  The composition of the atmosphere.  

In aviation weather reports, the units of pressure are inches  of mercury   $(^{\mathrm{"}}\mathrm{Hg})$   and millibars (mb) and   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$   equals   $1013.2\,\mathrm{mb}$  . This force or pressure is created by the moving  molecules act equally in all directions when measured at a  given point.  

In the METAR report, see  Figure 9-3 , the local altimeter  setting “A2955”, read as 29.55, is the pressure   $"\mathrm{Hg}$  . In the  remarks (RMK) section of this report, sea level pressure  expressed as   $"{\mathrm{SLP010}}"$  , the value expressed in millibars  (hPa), is used in weather forecasting.  

Dry air behaves almost like an ideal gas, meaning it obeys the  gas law given by  $\mathrm{P/DT}\,{=}\,\mathrm{R}$  , where P is pressure, D is density,  T is temperature, and R is a constant. This law states that the  ratio of pressure to the product of density and temperature  must always be the same. For instance, at a given pressure  if the temperature is much higher than standard, then the  density must be much lower. Air pressure and temperature  are usually measured, and using the gas law, density of the air  can be calculated and used to determine aircraft performance  under those conditions.  

# Standard Atmosphere  

Using a representative vertical distribution of these variables,  the standard atmosphere has been defined and is used for  pressure altimeter calibrations. Since changes in the static  pressure can affect pitot-static instrument operation, it is  necessary to understand basic principles of the atmosphere.  To provide a common reference for temperature and pressure,  a definition for standard atmosphere, also called International  Standard Atmosphere (ISA), has been established. In  addition to affecting certain flight instruments, these standard  conditions are the basis for most aircraft performance data.  

KAPA 1014522 11004KT 10SM SCT055 BKN120 00/M04 A2955 RMK A02 SLP010 T00001039 $\pmb{\mathsf{A2955}}=$  Local altimeter setting 29.55 SLP01  $)=$  Sea level presure in hPa used in weather forecasting  

At sea level, the standard atmosphere consists of a barometric  pressure of   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , or   $1{,}013{.}2\;\mathrm{mb}$  , and a temperature of   $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or  $59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Under standard conditions (ISA), a column  of air at sea level weighs   $14.7\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2}$  .  

Since temperature normally decreases with altitude, a  standard lapse rate can be used to calculate temperature at  various altitudes. Below 36,000 feet, the standard temperature  lapse rate is  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(3.5~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ) per 1,000 feet of altitude change.  Pressure does not decrease linearly with altitude, but for the  first 10,000 feet,   $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   for each 1,000 feet approximates  the rate of pressure change. It is important to note that the  standard lapse rates should be used only for flight planning  purposes with the understanding that large variations from  standard conditions can exist in the atmosphere.  [Figure 9-4]

Figure 9-4.  Standard atmosphere.  

# Layers of the Atmosphere  

The earth’s atmosphere is divided into five strata, or layers:  troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and  exosphere.  [Figure 9-5]  These layers are defined by the  temperature change with increasing altitude. The lowest  layer, called the troposphere, exhibits an average decrease in  temperature from the earth’s surface to about 36,000 feet above  mean sea level (MSL). The troposphere is deeper in the tropics  and shallower in the polar regions. It also varies seasonally,  being higher in the summer and lower in the winter months.  

Almost all of the earth’s weather occurs in the troposphere  as most of the water vapor and clouds are found in this layer.  The lower part of the troposphere interacts with the land and  sea surface, providing thermals, mountain waves, and sea- breeze fronts. Although temperatures decrease as altitude  increases in the troposphere, local areas of temperature  increase (inversions) are common.  

The top of the troposphere is called the tropopause. The  pressure at this level is only about ten percent of MSL (0.1  atmosphere) and density is decreased to about 25 percent  of its sea level value. Temperature reaches its minimum  value at the tropopause, approximately  $-55\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(-67\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  . For  pilots, this is an important part of the atmosphere because it  is associated with a variety of weather phenomena, such as  thunderstorm tops, clear air turbulence, and jet streams. The  vertical limit altitude of the tropopause varies with season  and with latitude. The tropopause is lower in the winter and  at the poles; it is higher in the summer and at the equator.  

The tropopause separates the troposphere from the  stratosphere. In the stratosphere, the temperature tends to  first change very slowly with increasing height. However, as  altitude increases the temperature increases to approximately   $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(32\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   reaching its maximum value at about 160,000  feet MSL. Unlike the troposphere in which the air moves  freely both vertically and horizontally, the air within the  stratosphere moves mostly horizontally.  

Gliders have reached into the lower stratosphere using  mountain waves. At these altitudes, pressurization becomes  an issue, as well as the more obvious breathing oxygen  requirements. Layers above the stratosphere have some  interesting features that are normally not of importance to  glider pilots. However, interested pilots might refer to any  general text on weather or meteorology.  

# Scale of Weather Events  

When preparing forecasts, meteorologists consider  atmospheric circulation on many scales. To aid the  forecasting of short- and long-term weather, various weather  events have been organized into three broad categories  called the scales of circulations. The size and lifespan of the  phenomena in each scale are roughly proportional, so that  larger size scales coincide with longer lifetimes. The term  “microscale” refers to features with spatial dimensions of .10  to 1 NM and lasting for seconds to minutes. An example is  an individual thermal. The term “mesoscale” refers to the  horizontal dimensions of 1 to  $1{,}000\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   and lasting for many  minutes to weeks. Examples include mountain waves, sea  breeze fronts, thunderstorms, and fronts. Research scientists  break down the mesoscale into further subdivisions to better  classify various phenomena. The term “macroscale” refers  to the horizontal dimensions greater than   $1{,}000~\mathrm{{NM}}$   and  lasting for weeks to months. These include the long waves in  the general global circulation and the jet streams embedded  within those waves.  [Figure 9-6]  

![](images/b6da214bd25edf88ac1f8558cc35377145784a4b7336adacaa90e12e5f3414f7.jpg)

Figure 9-6.  Scale of circulation—horizontal dimensions and life spans of associated weather events.  

Smaller scale features are embedded in larger scale features.  For instance, a microscale thermal may be just one of many  in a mesoscale convergence line, like a sea breeze front.  

The sea breeze front may occur only under certain synoptic  (i.e., simultaneous) conditions, which is controlled by the  macroscale circulations. The scales interact, with feedback  from smaller to larger scales and vice versa, in ways that are  not yet fully understood by atmospheric scientists. Generally,  the behavior and evolution of macroscale features are more  predictable, with forecast skill decreasing as scale diminishes.  For instance, forecasts of up to a few days for major events,  such as a trough with an associated cold front, have become  increasingly accurate. However, nobody would attempt to  forecast the exact time and location of an individual thermal  an hour ahead of time. Since most of the features of interest  to soaring pilots lie in the smaller mesoscale and microscale  range, prediction of soaring weather is a challenge.  

Soaring forecasts should begin with the macroscale, which  identifies large-scale patterns that produce good soaring  conditions. This varies from site to site and depends, for  instance, on whether the goal is thermal, ridge, or wave  soaring. Then, mesoscale features should be considered. This  may include items such as the cloudiness and temperature  structure of the air mass behind a cold front, as well as the  amount of rain produced by the front. Understanding lift  types, and environments in which they form, is the first step  to understanding how to forecast soaring weather.  

# Thermal Soaring Weather  

A thermal is a rising mass of buoyant air. Thermals are  the most common updraft used to sustain soaring flight.  In the next sections, several topics related to thermal  soaring weather are explored, including thermal structure,  atmospheric stability, the use of atmospheric soundings, and  air masses conducive to thermal soaring.  

Convection refers to an energy transfer involving mass  motions. Thermals are convective currents and are one means  by which the atmosphere transfers heat energy vertically.  Advection is the term meteorologists use to describe  horizontal transfer; for instance, cold air advection after the  passage of a cold front. As a note of caution, meteorologists  use the word “convection” to mean deep convection, that  is, thunderstorms. Unfortunately, there is often a fine  meteorological line between a warm, sunny day with plenty  of thermals, and a warm, sunny day that is stable and produces  no thermals. To the earthbound general public, it matters  little—either is a nice day. Glider pilots, however, need a  better understanding of these conditions and must often rely  on their own forecasting skills.  

# Thermal Shape and Structure  

Two primary conceptual models exist for the structure of  thermals: bubble model and column or plume model. Which  model best represents thermals encountered by glider pilots  is a topic of ongoing debate among atmospheric scientists. In  reality, thermals fitting both conceptual models likely exist. A  blend of the models, such as individual strong bubbles rising  within one plume, may be what occurs in many situations.  These models attempt to simplify a complex and often  turbulent phenomenon, so many exceptions and variations  are to be expected while actually flying in thermals. Many  books, articles, and Internet resources are available for further  reading on this subject.  

The bubble model describes an individual thermal resembling  a vortex ring, with rising air in the middle and descending  air on the sides. The air in the middle of the vortex ring  rises faster than the entire thermal bubble. The model fits  occasional reports from glider pilots. At times, one glider  may find no lift, when only 200 feet below another glider  climbs away. At other times, one glider may be at the top of  the bubble climbing only slowly, while a lower glider climbs  rapidly in the stronger part of the bubble below.  [Figure 9-7] More often, a glider flying below another glider circling in a  thermal is able to contact the same thermal and climb, even  if the gliders are displaced vertically by 1,000 feet or more.  This suggests the column or plume model of thermals is more  common.  [Figure 9-8]  

![](images/f56f0791ffa961f00bcea101e3ab4203373e801cd7e6630a595f5ee30537d830.jpg)  
Figure 9-7.  The bubble or vortex ring model of a thermal.  

Which of the two models best describes thermals depends  on the source or reservoir of warm air near the surface. If  the heated area is rather small, one single bubble may rise  and take with it all the warmed surface air. On the other  hand, if a large area is heated and one spot acts as the initial  trigger, surrounding warm air flows into the relative void  left by the initial thermal. The in-rushing warm air follows  the same path, creating a thermal column or plume. Since  all the warmed air near the surface is not likely to have the  exact same temperature, it is easy to envision a column  with a few or several imbedded bubbles. Individual bubbles  within a thermal plume may merge, while at other times,  two adjacent and distinct bubbles seem to exist side by side.  

![](images/a6134275d95ef18d0b448d9e8f023a4541bbf3713b24b6880b61599c103351f1.jpg)  
Figure 9-8.  The column or plume model of a thermal.  

No two thermals are exactly alike since the thermal sources  are not the same.  

Whether considered a bubble or column, the air in the middle  of the thermal rises faster than the air near the sides of the  thermal. A horizontal slice through an idealized thermal  provides a bull’s-eye pattern. Real thermals usually are not  perfectly concentric; techniques for best using thermals are  discussed in the next chapter.  [Figure 9-9]  

The diameter of a typical thermal cross-section is on the  order of 500–1,000 feet, though the size varies considerably.  Typically, due to mixing with the surrounding air, thermals  expand as they rise. Thus, the thermal column may actually  resemble a cone, with the narrowest part near the ground.  Thermal plumes also tilt in a steady wind and can become  quite distorted in the presence of vertical shear. If vertical  shear is strong enough, thermals can become very turbulent  or become completely broken apart. A schematic of a thermal  lifecycle in wind shear is shown in  Figure 9-10 .  

# Atmospheric Stability  

Stability in the atmosphere tends to hinder vertical motion,  while instability tends to promote vertical motion. A certain  

![](images/b51aed469f38f3814257630989e2f1554cc87c204b5ce88bba321385bca14983.jpg)  
Figure 9-9.  Cross-section through a thermal. Darker green is  stronger lift; red is sink.  

amount of instability is desirable for glider pilots; without it,  thermals would not develop. If the air is moist enough and  the atmospheric instability is deep enough, thunderstorms  and associated hazards can form. Thus, an understanding of  atmospheric stability and its determination from available  weather data is important for soaring flight and safety. As  a note, the following discussion is concerned with vertical  stability of the atmosphere. Other horizontal atmospheric  instabilities, such as the evolution of large-scale cyclones,  are not covered here.  

Generally, a stable dynamic system is one in which a displaced  element returns to its original position. An unstable dynamic  system is one in which a displaced element accelerates away  from its original position. In a neutrally stable system, the  displaced element neither returns to nor accelerates from  its original position. In the atmosphere, it is easiest to use  a parcel of air as the displaced element. The behavior of a  stable or unstable system is analogous to aircraft stability  discussed in Chapter 3, Aerodynamics of Flight.  

For simplicity, assume first that the air is completely dry.  Effects of moisture in atmospheric stability are considered  later. A parcel of dry air that is forced to rise expands due to  decreasing pressure and cools in the process. By contrast, a  parcel of dry air that is forced to descend is compressed due  to increasing pressure and warms. If there is no transfer of  heat between the surrounding, ambient air and the displaced  parcel, the process is called adiabatic. Assuming adiabatic  motion, a rising parcel cools at a lapse rate of  $3\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(5.4\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  per 1,000 feet, known as the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR).  

![](images/6c30fe95e3fe5d21b356dcaba160f403aa7c1b15609ce5c60b2fcf607645dd51.jpg)  
Figure 9-10.  Lifecycle of a typical thermal with cumulus cloud.  

The DALR is the rate at which the temperature of unsaturated  air changes as a parcel ascends or descends through the  atmosphere which is approximately   $9.8~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1 kilometer.  On a thermodynamic chart, parcels cooling at the DALR are  said to follow a dry adiabatic. A parcel warms at the DALR as  it descends. In reality, heat transfer often occurs. For instance,  as a thermal rises, the circulation in the thermal itself (recall  the bubble model) mixes in surrounding air. Nonetheless,  the DALR is a good approximation.  

The DALR represents the lapse rate of the atmosphere when it  is neutrally stable. If the ambient lapse rate in some layer of air  is less than the DALR (for instance,  $1\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1,000 feet), then  that layer is stable. If the lapse rate is greater than the DALR,  it is unstable. An unstable lapse rate usually occurs within a  few hundred feet of the heated ground. When an unstable layer  develops aloft, the air quickly mixes and reduces the lapse rate  back to DALR. It is important to note that the DALR is not  the same as the standard atmospheric lapse rate of   $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per  1,000 feet. The standard atmosphere is a stable one.  

Another way to understand stability is to imagine two  scenarios, each with a different temperature at 3,000 feet  above ground level (AGL), but the same temperature at the  surface, nominally   $20\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$  . In both scenarios, a parcel of air  that started at   $20~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   at the surface has cooled to   $11~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   by  the time it has risen to 3,000 feet at the DALR. In the first  scenario, the parcel is still warmer than the surrounding air,  so it is unstable and the parcel keeps rising—a good thermal  day. In the second scenario, the parcel is cooler than the  surrounding air, so it is stable and sinks. The parcel in the  second scenario would need to be forced to 3,000 feet AGL  by a mechanism other than convection, such as being lifted  up a mountainside or a front.  [Figure 9-11]  

![](images/c71c6da9701a4779e8255c9afdf6ec18e6eacfeb12f4af414b88c256b50714a3.jpg)  
Figure 9-11.  Unstable (A) and stable (B) parcels of air.  

Figure 9-11  also illustrates factors leading to instability. A  stable atmosphere can turn unstable in one of two ways. First,  if the surface parcel warms by more than   $2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (to greater  than  $22\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ), the layer to 3,000 feet then becomes unstable in  the second scenario. Thus, if the temperature of the air aloft  remains the same, warming the lower layers causes instability  and better thermal soaring. Second, if the air at 3,000 feet is  cooler, as in the first scenario, the layer becomes unstable.  Thus, if the temperature on the ground remains the same,  cooling aloft causes instability and better thermal soaring.  If the temperatures aloft and at the surface warm or cool  by the same amount, then the stability of the layer remains  unchanged. Finally, if the air aloft remains the same, but the  surface air cools (for instance, due to a very shallow front),  then the layer becomes even more stable.  

An inversion is a condition in which a layer warms as altitude  increases. Inversions can occur at any altitude and vary in  strength. In strong inversions, the temperature can rise as  much as  $10~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   over just a few hundred feet of altitude gain.  The most notable effect of an inversion is to cap any unstable  layer below. Along with trapping haze or pollution below, it  also effectively provides a cap to any thermal activity.  

So far, only completely dry air parcels have been considered.  However, moisture in the form of water vapor is always  present in the atmosphere. As a moist parcel of air rises, it  cools at the DALR until it reaches its dewpoint, at which time  the air in the parcel begins to condense. During the process of  condensation, heat (referred to as latent heat) is released to the  surrounding air. Once saturated, the parcel continues to cool,  but since heat is now added, it cools at a rate lower than the  DALR. The rate at which saturated air cools with height is  known as the saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR). Unlike the  DALR, the SALR varies substantially with altitude. At lower  altitudes, it is on the order of   $1.2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1,000 feet, whereas  at middle altitudes it increases to  $2.2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per 1,000 feet. Very  high up, above approximately 30,000 feet, little water vapor  exists to condense, and the SALR approaches the DALR.  

# Air Masses Conducive to Thermal  Soaring  

Generally, the best air masses for thermals are those with  cool air aloft, with conditions dry enough to allow the sun’s  heating at the surface, but not dry enough that cumulus form.  Along the West Coast of the continental United States, these  conditions are usually found after passage of a pacific cold  front. Similar conditions are found in the eastern and mid- west United States, except the source air for the cold front  is from polar continental regions, such as the interior of  Canada. In both cases, high pressure building into the region  is favorable, since it is usually associated with an inversion  aloft, which keeps cumulus from growing into rainshowers or  thundershowers. However, as the high pressure builds after  the second or third day, the inversion has often lowered to  the point that thermal soaring is poor or no longer possible.  This can lead to warm and sunny, but very stable conditions,  as the soaring pilot awaits the next cold front to destabilize  the atmosphere. Fronts that arrive too close together can also  cause poor postfrontal soaring, as high clouds from the next  front keep the surface from warming enough. Very shallow  cold fronts from the northeast (with cold air only one or two  thousand feet deep) often have a stabilizing effect along the  plains directly east of the Rocky Mountains. This is due to  cool low-level air undercutting warmer air aloft advecting  from the west.  

In the desert southwest, the Great Basin, and intermountain  west, good summertime thermal soaring conditions are often  produced by intense heating from below, even in the absence  of cooling aloft. This dry air mass with continental origins  produces cumulus bases 10,000 feet AGL or higher. At times,  this air spreads into eastern New Mexico and western Texas  as well. Later in the summer, however, some of these regions  come under the influence of the North American Monsoon,  which can lead to widespread and daily late morning or early  afternoon thundershowers.  [Figure 9-12]  

# Cloud Streets  

Cumulus clouds are often randomly distributed across the  sky, especially over relatively flat terrain. Under the right  conditions, however, cumulus can become aligned in long  bands, called cloud streets. These are more or less regularly  spaced bands of cumulus clouds. Individual streets can extend  50 miles or more while an entire field of cumulus streets can  extend hundreds of miles. The spacing between streets is  typically three times the height of the clouds. Cloud streets  are aligned parallel to the wind direction; thus, they are ideal  for a downwind cross-country flight. Glider pilots can often  fly many miles with little or no circling, sometimes achieving  glide ratios far exceeding the still-air value.  

Cloud streets usually occur over land with cold air outbreaks,  for instance, following a cold front. Brisk surface winds and  a wind direction remaining nearly constant up to cloud base  are favorable cloud street conditions. Windspeed should  increase by 10 to 20 knots between the surface and cloud  base, with a maximum somewhere in the middle of or near  the top of the convective layer. Thermals should be capped  by a notable inversion or stable layer.  

A vertical slice through an idealized cloud street illustrates  a distinct circulation, with updrafts under the clouds and  downdrafts in between. Due to the circulation, sink between  streets may be stronger than typically found away from  cumulus.  [Figure 9-13]  

Thermal streets, with a circulation like  Figure 9-13 , may  exist without cumulus clouds. Without clouds as markers,  use of such streets is more difficult. A glider pilot flying  upwind or downwind in consistent sink should alter course  crosswind to avoid inadvertently flying along a line of sink  between thermal streets.  

# Thermal Waves  

Figure 9-14  shows a wavelike form for the inversion capping  the cumulus clouds. If the winds above the inversion are

Figure 9-13.  Circulation across a cloud street.  

perpendicular to the cloud streets and increasing at 10 knots  per 5,000 feet or more, cloud street waves can form in the  stable air above. Though usually relatively weak, thermal  waves can produce lift of 100 to 500 fpm and allow smooth  flight along streets above the cloud base.  [Figure 9-14]  

So-called cumulus waves also exist. These are similar to cloud  street waves, except the cumulus clouds are not organized in  streets. Cumulus waves require a capping inversion or stable  layer and increasing wind above cumulus clouds. However,  directional shear is not necessary. Cumulus waves may also  be short lived, and difficult to work for any length of time. An  exception is when the cumulus is anchored to some feature,  such as a ridge line or short mountain range.  

In these cases, the possible influence of the ridge or mountain  in creating the wave lift becomes uncertain. Further discussion  of atmospheric waves appears later in this chapter. As a final  note, thermal waves can also form without clouds present.  

# Thunderstorms  

An unstable atmosphere can provide great conditions  for thermal soaring. If the atmosphere is too moist and  unstable, however, cumulonimbus (Cb) or thunderclouds  can form. Cb clouds are the recognized standard marker of  thunderstorms. When Cb builds sufficiently, it changes from  rainstorm to thunderstorm status. Well developed Cb clouds  are thunderstorms. Not all precipitating, large cumulo-form  clouds are accompanied by lightning and thunder, although  their presence is usually an indication that conditions are  ripe for full-blown thunderstorms. Forecasters sometimes  use the term “deep convection” to refer to convection that  rises to high levels, which usually means thunderstorms.  The tremendous amount of energy associated with Cb stems  from the release of latent heat as condensation occurs with  the growing cloud.  

Thunderstorms can occur any time of year, though they  are more common during the spring and summer seasons.  They can occur anywhere in the continental United States  but are not common along the immediate West Coast,  where an average of only about one per year occurs. During  the summer months, the desert southwest, extending  northeastward into the Rocky Mountains and adjacent Great  Plains, experiences an average of 30 to 40 thunderstorms  

![](images/c69c9fc63052c1964430583e7d58591e1f795f7ef662801e47b173c5476499a3.jpg)

annually. Additionally, in the southeastern United States,  especially Florida, between 30 and 50 thunderstorms occur  in an average year. Thunderstorms in the cool seasons usually  occur in conjunction with some forcing mechanism, such  as a fast moving cold front or a strong upper-level trough.  [Figure 9-15]  

The lifecycle of an air-mass or ordinary thunderstorm consists  of three main stages: cumulus, mature, and dissipating. The  term “ordinary” describes the type of thunderstorm consisting  of a single Cb, since other types of thunderstorms (described  below) can occur in a uniform large scale air mass. The entire  lifecycle takes on the order of an hour, though remnant cloud  from the dissipated Cb can last substantially longer.  

The cumulus stage is characterized by a cumulus growing to  a towering cumulus (Tcu), or cumulus congestus. During this  stage, most of the air within the cloud is going up. The size  of the updraft increases, while the cloud base broadens to a  few miles in diameter. Since the cloud has increased in size,  the strong updraft in the middle of the cloud is not susceptible  to entrainment of dryer air from the outside. Often, other  smaller cumulus in the vicinity of the Tcu are suppressed by  general downward motion around the cloud. Towards the end  of the cumulus stage, downdrafts and precipitation begin to  form within the cloud. On some days, small cumulus can be  around for hours, before Tcu form, while on other days, the  air is so unstable that almost as soon as any cumulus form,  they become Tcu.  [Figure 9-16]  

As the evolution of the thunderstorm continues, it reaches its  mature stage. By this time, downdrafts reach the ground and  spread out in what are known as downbursts or microbursts.  These often lead to strong and sometimes damaging surface  winds. Gliders should not be flown or exposed to microbursts  and the associated windshears. While increased headwinds  can momentarily improve performance, the distance from the  landing area may be increased beyond the capabilities of the  glider. Attempting to launch with possible windshears can  result in fatal consequences.  

Note: Launching of a glider either behind a towplane or  ground launch is risky.  Given the size of windshears, the  towplane could be in a tailwind situation while the glider

is in a headwind situation.  With the likely outcome of that  combination of factors, and the hazards of ground handling,  operations in such conditions must be severely discouraged.  

Pilots need to watch apparently dissipating thunderstorms  closely for new dark, firm bases that indicate a new cell  forming. In addition, outflow from one Cb may flow several  miles before encountering an area where the air is primed  for lifting given an extra boost. The relatively cool air in the  outflow can provide that boost, leading to new a Cb, which  is nearby but not connected to the original Cb.  

# Lifted Index  

The LI is determined by subtracting the temperature of a  parcel that has been lifted to   $500~\mathrm{mb}$   from the temperature  of the ambient air. This index does not give the likelihood  of thunderstorm occurrence; rather, it gives an indication of  thunderstorm severity if one does occur. In  Figure 9-17 , an LI of   $^{-5}$   indicates moderately severe thunderstorms if they develop.  

![Figure 9-17.  Lifted index   $(L I)$   versus thunderstorm severity. ](images/0a442473e41c74464be077206521b7b2a2b505abdb2ebcd0da5660ca06797800.jpg)  

# K-Index  

The KI is used to determine the probability of thunderstorm  occurrence and uses information about temperature and  moisture at three levels. It is given by the equation   $\mathrm{KI}=$   $(\mathrm{T850-T500})+\mathrm{Td850-(T700-T d700)}$  . Here, T stands  for temperature, Td is the dewpoint, and 500, 700, or 850  indicates the level in mb. All values are obtained from  a morning sounding. Using the following values from a  morning sounding  $\mathrm{KI}=(16-[-9])+12-(6-0)=31.$  . This  indicates about a 60 percent probability that thunderstorms  will occur.  [Figure 9-18]  As discussed below, charts showing  both the LI and KI for all the sounding sites in the continental  United States are produced daily.  

![Figure 9-18.   $K$  -Index (KI) versus probability of thunderstorm  occurrence. ](images/28f61c41ec247b7726ef27c74849323a4490978e261a0035d2360a2f224c4adc.jpg)  

Thunderstorms have several hazards, including turbulence,  strong updrafts and downdrafts, strong shifting surface winds,  hail, icing, poor visibility and/or low ceilings, lightning,  and even tornadoes. Once a cloud has grown to be a Cb,  hazards are possible, whether or not there are obvious  signs. Since thermal soaring weather can rapidly deteriorate  into thunderstorm weather, recognition of each hazard is  important. Knowledge of the many hazards may inspire  the pilot to land and secure the glider when early signs of  thunderstorm activity appear—the safest solution.  

Moderate turbulence is common within several miles of a  thunderstorm, and it should be expected. Severe or even  extreme turbulence (leading to possible structural failure)  can occur anywhere within the thunderstorm itself. The  inside of a thunderstorm is no place for glider pilots of any  experience level. Outside of the storm, severe turbulence  is common. One region of expected turbulence is near the  surface gust front as cool outflow spreads from the storm.  Violent updrafts can be followed a second or two later by  violent downdrafts, with occasional side gusts adding to the  excitement—not a pleasant proposition while in the landing  pattern. At somewhat higher altitudes, but below the base of  the Cb, moderate to severe turbulence can also be found along  the boundary between the cool outflow and warm air feeding  the Cb. Unpredictable smaller scale turbulent gusts can occur  anywhere near a thunderstorm, so recognizing and avoiding  the gust front does not mean safety from severe turbulence.  

Large and strong updrafts and downdrafts accompany  thunderstorms in the mature stage. Updrafts under the Cb  base feeding into the cloud can easily exceed   $1{,}000~\mathrm{fpm}$  .  Near the cloud base, the distance to the edge of the cloud  can be deceptive; trying to avoid being inhaled into the cloud  by strong updrafts can be difficult. In the later cumulus and  early mature stage, updrafts feeding the cloud can cover  many square miles. As the storm enters its mature stage,  strong downdrafts, called downbursts or microbursts, can  be encountered, even without very heavy precipitation  present. Downbursts can also cover many square miles  with descending air of 2,000 fpm or more. A pilot unlucky  enough to fly under a forming downburst, which may not be  visible, could encounter sink of 2,000 or 3,000 fpm, possibly  greater in extreme cases. If such a downburst is encountered  at pattern altitude, it can cut the normal time available to  the pilot for planning the approach. For instance, a normal  3-minute pattern from 800 feet AGL to the ground happens  in a mere 19 seconds in 2,500 fpm sink!  

When a downburst or microburst hits the ground, the  downdraft spreads out, leading to the strong surface winds,  known as thunderstorm outflow. Typically, the winds strike  quickly and give little warning of their approach. While  soaring, pilots should keep a sharp lookout between the  storm and the intended landing spot for signs of a wind shift.  Blowing dust, smoke, or wind streaks on a lake indicating  wind from the storm are clues that a gust front is rapidly  approaching. Thunderstorm outflow winds are usually at  speeds of 20 to 40 knots for a period of 5 to 10 minutes before  diminishing. However, winds can easily exceed 60 knots,  and in some cases, with a slow-moving thunderstorm, strong  winds can last substantially longer. Although damaging  outflow winds usually do not extend more than 5 or 10 miles  from the Cb, winds of 20 or 30 knots can extend 50 miles or  more from large thunderstorms.  

Hail is possible with any thunderstorm and can exist as part  of the main rain shaft. Hail can also occur many miles from  the main rain shaft, especially under the thunderstorm anvil.  Pea-sized hail usually does not damage a glider, but the large  hail associated with a severe storm can dent metal gliders  or damage the gelcoat on composite gliders, whether on the  ground or in the air.  

Icing is usually a problem only within a cloud, especially  at levels where the outside temperature is approximately 

  $-10~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Under these conditions, supercooled water droplets 

 (water existing in a liquid state  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and below) can rapidly  freeze upon contact with wings and other surfaces. At the  beginning of the mature stage, early precipitation below  cloud base may be difficult to see. At times, precipitation can  even be falling through an updraft feeding the cloud. Snow,  graupel, or ice pellets falling from the forming storm above  can stick to the leading edge of the wing, causing degradation  in performance. Rain on the wings can be a problem since  some airfoils can be adversely affected by water.  

Poor visibility due to precipitation and possible low ceilings  as the air below the thunderstorm is cooled is yet another  concern. Even light or moderate precipitation can reduce  visibility dramatically. Often, under a precipitating Cb, there  is no distinction between precipitation and actual cloud.  

Lightning in a thunderstorm occurs in cloud, cloud to cloud  (in the case of other nearby storms, such as a multicell  storm), or cloud to ground. Lightning strikes are completely  unpredictable, and cloud-to-ground strikes are not limited to  areas below the cloud. Some strikes emanate from the side  of the Cb and travel horizontally for miles before turning  abruptly towards the ground. Inflight damage to gliders has  included burned control cables and blown-off canopies. In  some cases, strikes have caused little more than mild shock  and cosmetic damage. On the other extreme, a composite  training glider in Great Britain suffered a strike that caused  complete destruction of one wing; fortunately, both pilots  parachuted to safety. In that case, the glider was two or three  miles from the thunderstorm. Finally, ground launching,  especially with a metal cable, anywhere near a thunderstorm  should be avoided.  

Severe thunderstorms can sometimes spawn tornadoes, which  are rapidly spinning vortices, generally a few hundred to a few  thousand feet across. Winds can exceed  $200\,\mathrm{mph}$  . Tornadoes  that do not reach the ground are called funnel clouds. By  definition, tornadoes form from severe thunderstorms and  should obviously be avoided on the ground or in the air.  

# Weather for Slope Soaring  

Slope or ridge soaring refers to using updrafts produced  by the mechanical lifting of air as it encounters the upwind  slope of a hill, ridge, or mountain. Slope soaring requires  two ingredients: elevated terrain and wind.  

Slope lift is the easiest lift source to visualize. When it  encounters topography, wind is deflected horizontally,  vertically, or in some combination of the two. Not all  topography produces good slope lift. Individual or isolated  hills do not produce slope lift because the wind tends to  deflect around the hill, rather than over it. A somewhat  broader hill with a windward face at least a mile or so long,  might produce some slope lift, but the lift is confined to a  small area. The best ridges for slope soaring are at least a  few miles long.  

Slope lift can extend to a maximum of two or three times  the ridge height. However, the pilot may be able to climb  only to ridge height. As a general rule, the higher the ridge  above the adjacent valley, the higher the glider pilot can  climb. Ridges only 100 or 200 feet high can produce slope  lift. The problem with very low ridges is maintaining safe  maneuvering altitude, as well as sufficient altitude to land  safely in the adjacent valley. Practically speaking, 500 to  1,000 feet above the adjacent valley is a minimum ridge  height.  [Figure 9-19]  

In addition to a ridge being long and high enough, the  windward slope needs to be steep enough as well. An ideal  slope is on the order of 1 to 4. Shallower slopes do not create  

![](images/8758fd54b6618b37813a300360e644ec0800a848af97f4b11acce61b7bbf41b0.jpg)  
Figure 9-19.  Slope soaring.  

a vertical wind component strong enough to compensate for  the glider’s sink rate. Very steep, almost vertical slopes, on  the other hand, may not be ideal either. Such slopes create  slope lift, but can produce turbulent eddies along the lower  slope or anywhere close to the ridge itself. In such cases, only  the upper part of the slope may produce updrafts, although  steeper slopes do allow a quick escape to the adjacent valley.  [Figure 9-20]  

![](images/840f62937bb42a063a8b4951909d7799257a6e43a491043951861cb43b828b42.jpg)  
Figure 9-20.  Slope lift and eddy with near-vertical slope.  

A ridge upstream can block the wind flow, so that no low- level flow occurs upwind of an otherwise promising ridge,  and no updraft. Additionally, if lee waves are produced by  an upstream ridge or mountain, slope lift can be enhanced  or destroyed, depending on the wavelength of the lee waves. Locally, the downdraft from a thermal just upwind of the  ridge can cancel the slope lift for a short distance. The  bottom line: never assume slope lift is present. Always have  an alternative.  

Just as the flow is deflected upward on the windward side of  a ridge, it is deflected downward on the lee side of a ridge. [Figure 9-21]  This downdraft can be alarmingly strong—up  to 2,000 fpm or more near a steep ridge with strong winds  (see depiction A). Even in moderate winds, the downdraft  near a ridge can be strong enough to make penetration of the  upwind side of the ridge impossible. Flat-topped ridges also  offer little refuge, since sink and turbulence can combine  to make an upwind penetration impossible (see depiction  B). Finally, an uneven upwind slope with ledges or “steps”  requires extra caution since small-scale eddies, turbulence,  and sink can form there (see depiction C).  

![](images/8fe350b8f10352568a53d5e33bb0b243e887eb05e7b8d81f5e9c37e00167e4ff.jpg)  
Figure 9-21.  Airflow along different ridges.  

Three-dimensional effects are important as well. For  instance, a ridge with cusps or bowls may produce better lift  in upwind-facing bowls if the wind is at an angle from the  ridge. However, sink may be encountered on the lee side of  the bowl. If crossing ridges in windy conditions, always plan  for heavy sink on the lee side and make sure an alternative  is available.  [Figure 9-22]  

![](images/3b3385718b8fa009e62e91f70c6cb076e622e19cc318dcfb2d6b62b53e2a8fb0.jpg)  
Figure 9-22.  Three-dimensional effects of oblique winds and bowls.  

Depending on the slope, windspeed should be 10–15  knots and blowing nearly perpendicular to the ridge. Wind  directions up to   $30^{\circ}$   or   $40^{\circ}$   from perpendicular may still  produce slope lift. Vertical wind shear is also a consideration.  High ridges may have little or no wind along the lower slopes,  but the upper parts of the ridge may be in winds strong enough  to produce slope lift there.  

The area of best lift varies with height. Below the ridge crest,  the best slope lift is found within a few hundred feet of the  ridge, again depending on the slope and wind strength. As  mentioned, very steep ridges require extra speed and caution,  since eddies and turbulence can form even on the upwind side.  Above the ridge crest, the best lift usually is found further  upwind from the ridge the higher one climbs.  [Figure 9-19]  

When the air is very stable, and the winds are sufficient but not  too strong, slope lift can be very smooth, enabling safe soaring  close to the terrain. If the air is not stable, thermals may flow  up the slope. Depending on thermal strength and windspeed,  the thermal may rise well above the ridge top, or it may drift  into the lee downdraft and break apart. Downdrafts on the  sides of thermals can easily cancel the slope lift; extra speed  and caution are required when the air is unstable, especially  below the ridge crest near the terrain. The combination  of unstable air and strong winds can make slope soaring  unpleasant or even dangerous for the beginning glider pilot.  

Moisture must be considered. If air rising in the slope lift is  moist and cools sufficiently, a so-called cap cloud may form.  The cloud may form above the ridge, and if the air moistens  more with time, the cloud slowly lowers onto the ridge and  down the upwind slope, limiting the usable height of the slope  lift. Since the updraft forms the cloud, it is very easy to climb  into the cap cloud  [Figure 9-23] —a dangerous situation.

Figure 9-23.  Cap cloud.  

Under certain conditions, a morning cap cloud may rise as  the day warms, then slowly lower again as the day cools.  

# Wave Soaring Weather  

Where there is wind and stable air, there is the likelihood  of waves in the atmosphere. Most of the waves that occur  throughout the atmosphere are of no use to the glider  pilot. However, mountains or ridges often produce waves  downstream, the most powerful of which have lifted gliders to  49,000 feet. Indirect measurements show waves extending to  heights around 100,000 feet. If the winds aloft are strong and  widespread enough, mountain lee waves can extend the length  of the mountain range. Pilots have achieved flights in mountain  wave using three turn points of over 2,000 kilometers. Another  type of wave useful to soaring pilots is generated by thermals,  which were discussed in the previous section.  

A common analogy to help visualize waves created by  mountains or ridges uses water flowing in a stream or small  river. A submerged rock causes ripples (waves) in the water  downstream, which slowly dampen out. This analogy is  useful, but it is important to realize that the atmosphere  is far more complex, with vertical shear of the wind and  vertical variations in the stability profile. Wind blowing over  a mountain does not always produce downstream waves.  

Mountain wave lift is fundamentally different from slope  lift. Slope soaring occurs on the upwind side of a ridge  or mountain, while mountain wave soaring occurs on the  downwind side. (Mountain wave lift sometimes tilts upwind  with height. Therefore, at times near the top of the wave, the  glider pilot may be almost directly over the mountain or ridge  that produced the wave). The entire mountain wave system  is also more complex than the comparatively simple slope  soaring scenario.  

# Mechanism for Wave Formation  

Waves form in stable air when a parcel is vertically displaced  and then oscillates up and down as it tries to return to its  original level, illustrated in  Figure 9-24 . In the first frame,  the dry parcel is at rest at its equilibrium level. In the second  frame, the parcel is displaced upward along the DALR, where  it is cooler than the surrounding air. The parcel accelerates  downward toward its equilibrium level but it overshoots  the level due to momentum and keeps going down. The  third frame shows that the parcel is now warmer than the  surrounding air, and starts upward again. The process  continues with the motion damping out. The number of  oscillations depends on the initial parcel displacement and  the stability of the air. In the lower part of the figure, wind  has been added, illustrating the wave pattern that the parcel  makes as it oscillates vertically. If there were no wind, a  vertically displaced parcel would just oscillate up and down,  while slowly damping, at one spot over the ground, much  like a spring.  [Figure 9-24]  

The lower part of  Figure 9-24  also illustrates two important  features of any wave. The wavelength is the horizontal  distance between two adjacent wave crests. Typical mountain  wavelengths vary considerably, between 2 and 20 miles. The  amplitude is half the vertical distance between the trough  and crest of the wave. Amplitude varies with altitude and  is smallest near the surface and at upper levels. As a note,  mountain lee waves are sometimes simply referred to as  mountain waves, lee waves, and sometimes, standing waves.  

In the case of mountain waves, it is the airflow over the  mountain that displaces a parcel from its equilibrium level.  This leads to a two-dimensional conceptual model, which  is derived from the experience of many glider pilots plus  postflight analysis of the weather conditions.  Figure 9-25 illustrates a mountain with wind and temperature profiles.  Note the increase in windspeed (blowing from left to right)  with altitude and a stable layer near mountaintop with  less stable air above and below. As the air flows over the  mountain, it descends the lee slope (below its equilibrium  level if the air is stable) and sets up a series of oscillations  downstream. The wave flow itself usually is incredibly  smooth. Beneath the smooth wave flow is what is known as a  low-level turbulent zone, with an embedded rotor circulation  under each crest. Turbulence, especially within the individual  rotors, is usually moderate to severe, and can occasionally  become extreme.  [Figure 9-25]  

This conceptual model is often quite useful and representative  of real mountain waves, but many exceptions exist. For  instance, variations to the conceptual model occur when the  

![](images/433d47429d150b9281545949aca49599cb2ead2ef25ce67098f50da3762f978b.jpg)

Figure 9-25.  Mountain lee wave system.  

topography has many complex, three-dimensional features,  such as individual higher peak, large ridges, or spurs at right  angles to the main range. Variations can occur when a north- south range curves to become oriented northeast-southwest.  In addition, numerous variations of the wind and stability  profiles are possible.  

Turbulence associated with lee waves deserves respect. Low- level turbulence can range from unpleasant to dangerous.  Glider pilots refer to any turbulence under the smooth wave  flow above as “rotor.” The nature of rotor turbulence varies  from location to location as well as with different weather  regimes. At times, rotor turbulence is widespread and fairly  uniform; that is, it is equally rough everywhere below the  smooth wave flow. At other times, uniformly moderate  turbulence is found, with severe turbulence under wave  crests. On occasion, no discernable turbulence is noted except  for moderate or severe turbulence within a small-scale rotor  under the wave crest. Typically, the worst turbulence is found  on the leading edge of the primary rotor. Unfortunately, the  type and intensity of rotor turbulence are difficult to predict.  However, the general rule of thumb is that higher amplitude  lee waves tend to have stronger rotor turbulence.  

Clouds associated with the mountain wave system are  also indicated in  Figure 9-25 . A cap cloud flowing over  the mountain tends to dissipate as the air forced down the  mountain slope warms and dries. The first (or primary) wave  crest features a roll or rotor cloud with one or more lenticulars  (or lennies, using glider slang) above. Wave harmonics  farther downstream (secondary, tertiary, etc.) may also have  lenticulars and/or rotor clouds. If the wave reaches high  enough altitudes, lenticulars may form at cirrus levels as well.  

It is important to note that the presence of clouds depends on  the amount of moisture at various levels. The entire mountain  wave system can form in completely dry conditions with no  clouds at all. If only lower level moisture exists, only a cap  cloud and rotor clouds may be seen with no lenticulars above,  as in  Figure 9-26A . On other days, only mid-level or upper- level lenticulars are seen with no rotor clouds beneath them.  When low and mid levels are very moist, a deep rotor cloud  may form, with lenticulars right on top of the rotor cloud,  with no clear air between the two cloud forms.

Figure 9-26.  Small Foehn Gap under most conditions.  

In wet climates, the somewhat more moist air can advect  (meaning to convey horizontally by advection) in, such  that the gap between the cap cloud and primary rotor closes  completely, stranding the glider on top of the clouds, as in  Figure 9-26B . Caution is required when soaring above clouds  in very moist conditions.  

Suitable terrain is required for mountain wave soaring. Even  relatively low ridges of 1,000 feet or less vertical relief  can produce lee waves. Wave amplitude depends partly  on topography, shape, and size. The shape of the lee slope,  rather than the upwind slope, is important. Very shallow lee  slopes are not conducive to producing waves of sufficient  amplitude to support a glider. A resonance exists between  the topography width and lee wavelength that is difficult to  predict. One particular mountain height, width, and lee slope  is not optimum under all weather conditions. Different wind  and stability profiles favor different topography profiles.  Hence, there is no substitute for experience at a particular  soaring site when predicting wave-soaring conditions.  Uniform height of the mountaintops along the range is also  conducive to better organized waves.  

The weather requirements for wave soaring include sufficient  wind and a proper stability profile. Windspeed should be at  least 15 to 20 knots at mountaintop level with increasing  winds above. The wind direction should be within about   $30^{\circ}$   perpendicular to the ridge or mountain range. The  requirement of a stable layer near mountaintop level is more  qualitative. A sounding showing a DALR, or nearly so, near  the mountaintop would not likely produce lee waves even  with adequate winds. A well-defined inversion at or near the  mountaintop with less stable air above is best.  

Weaker lee waves can form without much increase in  windspeed with height, but an actual decrease in windspeed  with height usually caps the wave at that level. When winds  decrease dramatically with height, for instance, from 30  to 10 knots over two or three thousand feet, turbulence is  common at the top of the wave. On some occasions, the flow  at mountain level may be sufficient for wave, but then begins  to decrease with altitude just above the mountain, leading  to a phenomenon called “rotor streaming.” In this case, the  air downstream of the mountain breaks up and becomes  turbulent, similar to rotor, with no lee waves above.  

Lee waves experience diurnal effects, especially in the spring,  summer, and fall. Height of the topography also influences  diurnal effects. For smaller topography, as morning leads to  afternoon and the air becomes unstable to heights exceeding  the wave-producing topography, lee waves tend to disappear.  On occasion, the lee wave still exists but more height is needed  to reach the smooth wave lift. Toward evening as thermals  again die down and the air stabilizes, lee waves may again  form. During the cooler season, when the air remains stable all  day, lee waves are often present all day, as long as the winds  aloft continue. The daytime dissipation of lee waves is not as  notable for large mountains. For instance, during the 1950s  Sierra Wave Project (see www.soaringmuseum.org), it was  found that the wave amplitude reached a maximum in mid  to late afternoon, when convective heating was a maximum.  Rotor turbulence also increased dramatically at that time.  

Topography upwind of the wave-producing range can also  create problems, as illustrated in  Figure 9-27 . In the first case  [Figure  $9–27A J$  , referred to as destructive interference, the  wavelength of the wave from the first range is out of phase  with the distance between the ranges. Lee waves do not form  downwind of the second range, despite winds and stability  aloft being favorable. In the second case  [Figure 9-27B] ,  referred to as constructive interference, the ranges are in  phase, and the lee wave from the second range has a larger  amplitude than it might otherwise.

Figure 9-27.  Constructive and destructive interference.  

Wave flight is a unique soaring experience and requires  planning, equipment and Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) notification for the flight. The Soaring Society of  America (SSA) Awards and Badges offers soaring pilots  Lennie Awards for completing and documenting a wave  flight.  [Figure 9-28]  

Isolated small hills or conical mountains do not form classic  lee waves. In some cases, they do form waves emanating at  an angle to the wind flow similar to water waves created by  the wake of a ship. A single peak may require only a mile  or two in the dimension perpendicular to the wind for high- amplitude lee waves to form, though the wave lift is confined  to a relatively small area in these cases.

While working out of the Bishop, California, airport in the late 1940s, mountain pilot and wave pilot pioneer Robert F.  Symons created a new and unique system of awards for wave  flying, which he called “Iennie” pins. Pilots who soared to great  heights in the Sierra Wave received a one-lennie pin for  attaining an altitude of 25,000 to 35,000 feet, a two-lennie pin  for reaching 35,000 to 40,000 feet, and a three-lennie pin for  exceeding 40,000 feet.  

Very early, Symons recognized the excellent soaring  conditions in the Owens Valley and helped organize a soaring  group in 1938. As a professional pilot engaged in cloud  seeding, he learned first hand of the power generated in the  Sierra Wave and became well known for his studies and  lectures on mountain wave phenomena. Although his lists are incomplete, it is believed that he issued some 35 one-lennie,  16 two-lennie, and 10 three-lennie pins. The awarding of  these pins ceased in 1958, when Symons lost his life in a  glider accident.  

In 1962 Carl Burson, Jr., saw one of these pins and upon learning of its history, became interested in reestablishing  their issuance as a memorial to Bob Symons. In 1963, the  program was reestablished under the official auspices of the SSA, with each new pin holder also receiving a handsome  wall plaque. The pin itself is 7mm in diameter (the same as the  FAI Gold Badge) and has one, two, or three white lenticular  clouds against a blue background with a silver rim. Each pin  is consecutively numbered.

# Lift Due to Convergence  

Convergence lift is most easily imagined when easterly and  westerly winds meet. When two opposing air masses meet,  air is pushed aloft by the two opposing winds. Air does not  need to meet head on to go up, however. Wherever air piles  up, it leads to convergence and rising air.  

One type of convergence line commonly found near coastal  areas is the so-called sea-breeze front. Inland areas heat  during the day, while the adjacent sea maintains about the  same temperature. Inland heating leads to lower pressure,  drawing in cooler sea air. As the cooler air moves inland, it  behaves like a miniature shallow cold front, and lift forms  along a convergence line. Sometimes consistent lift can be  found along the sea-breeze front while at other times it acts  as a focus for a line of thermals. If the inland air is quite  unstable, the sea-breeze front can act as a focus for a line of  thunderstorms. Additionally, since the air on the coast side  of the sea-breeze front is rather cool, passage of the front can  spell the end of thermal soaring for the day.  

Sea air often has a higher dewpoint than drier inland air.  As shown in  Figure 9-29 , a curtain cloud sometimes forms,  marking the area of strongest lift. Due to the mixing of  different air along the sea-breeze front, at times the lift can  be quite turbulent. At other times, weak and fairly smooth  lift is found.  

Several factors influence the sea-breeze front character  (e.g., turbulence, strength, and speed of inland penetration,  including the degree of inland heating and the land/sea  temperature difference). For instance, if the land/sea  temperature difference at sunrise is small and overcast cirrus  clouds prevent much heating, only a weak sea-breeze front, if  any, forms. Another factor is the synoptic wind flow. A weak  synoptic onshore flow may cause quicker inland penetration  of the sea-breeze front, while a strong onshore flow may  prevent the sea-breeze front from developing at all. On the  other hand, moderate offshore flow generally prevents any  inland penetration of the sea-breeze front.  

If the sea-breeze front is well defined and marked by a curtain  cloud, the pilot can fly straight along the line in fairly steady  lift. A weaker convergence line that is not well-defined often  produces more lift than sink and the pilot must fly slower  in lift and faster in sink. Soaring pilots must be aware that  convergence zone lift can be turbulent especially if the colder  and warmer air is mixing and be prepared that flying the  thermals may be difficult at times.  

Convergence can also occur along and around mountains or  ridges. In  Figure 9-30A , flow is deflected around a ridgeline  and meets as a convergence line on the lee side of the ridge.  The line may be marked by cumulus or a boundary with a  sharp visibility contrast. The latter occurs if the air coming  around one end of the ridge flows past a polluted urban  area, such as in the Lake Elsinore soaring area in southern  California. In very complex terrain, with ridges or ranges  oriented at different angles to one another, or with passes  between high peaks, small-scale convergence zones can  be found in adjacent valleys, depending on wind strength  and direction.  Figure 9-30B  illustrates a smaller-scale  convergence line flowing around a single hill or peak and  forming a line of lift stretching downwind from the peak.  

Convergence can also form along the top of a ridgeline or  mountain range. In  Figure 9-31 , drier synoptic-scale wind  flows up the left side of the mountain, while a more moist  valley breeze flows up the right side of the slope. The two  flows meet at the mountain top and form lift along the entire  range. If clouds are present, the air from the moist side  condenses first, often forming one cloud with a well-defined  step, marking the convergence zone. For this scenario, the  better lift conditions will be found on the west side where  the air is dryer rather than the east side where clouds are  more likely to form.  

As a final example, toward evening in mountainous terrain  and as heating daytime abates, a cool katabatic, or drainage,  wind flows down the slopes. The flow down the slope  converges with air in the adjacent valley to form an area of  weak lift. Sometimes the convergence is not strong enough  for general lifting, but acts as a trigger for the last thermal  of the day. In narrow valleys, flow down the slope from  both sides of the valley can converge and cause weak lift.  [Figure 9-32]  Many local sites in either flat or mountainous  terrain have lines or zones of lift that are likely to be caused or  enhanced by convergence. Chapter 10, Soaring Techniques,  covers locating and using convergence.

# Obtaining Weather Information  

One of the most important aspects of flight planning is  obtaining reliable weather information. Fortunately, pilots  have several outlets to receive reliable weather reports and  forecasts to help them determine if a proposed flight can  be completed safely. For visual flight rules (VFR) flights,  federal regulations require pilots to gather weather reports  and forecasts only if they plan to depart the airport vicinity.  Nevertheless, it is always a good idea to be familiar with  the current and expect weather anytime a flight is planned.  Preflight weather information sources include Automated  Flight Service Stations (AFSS) and National Weather Service  (NWS) telephone briefers, the Direct User Access Terminal  System (DUATS), and the Internet. In addition, a multitude  of commercial venders provide custom services.  

For complete details regarding available weather services and  products, refer to the current version of the FAA Advisory  Circular (AC) 00-45, Aviation Weather Services, and in the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, Chapter 12,  Aviation Weather Services.  

# Preflight Weather Briefing  

Often times in order to obtain a preflight weather briefing,  certain background information must be given to the weather  specialist: type of flight planned, whether flying VFR (Visual  Flight Rules) or IFR (Instrument Flight Rules), aircraft  registration or pilot’s name, aircraft type, departure airport,  route of flight, destination, flight altitude(s), estimated time  of departure (ETD), and estimated time en route (ETE).  Operators of airports, gliderports, or fixed-base operators  (FBO) may obtain current reports and forecasts from the  AFSS or NWS at various times throughout the day and post  them on a bulletin board for easy reference.  

Weather briefers do not actually predict the weather; they  simply translate and interpret weather reports and forecasts  within the vicinity of the airport, route of flight, or the  destination airport if the flight is a cross-country. A pilot may  request one of four types of briefings: standard, abbreviated,  soaring  [Figure 9-33],  or outlook.  

# Weather-ReIated Information  

Weather-related information can be found on the Internet,  including sites directed toward aviation. These sites can be  found using a variety of Internet search engines. It is important  to verify the timeliness and source of the weather information  provided by the Internet sites to ensure the information is up  to date and accurate. Pilots should exercise caution when  accessing weather information on the Internet, especially  if the information cannot be verified. Other sources of  accurate weather information are the NWS website located at

DEFINITIONS:  

Convective Condensation Level - The height to which an air parcel possessing 

      the average saturation mixing ratio in the lowest 4000 feet of the airmass,

      if heated sufficiently from below, will rise dry adiabatically until it

      just becomes saturated.  It estimates the base of cumulus clouds that are

      produced by surface heating only.  

Convection Temperature (ConvectionT) - The surface temperature required to 

      make the airmass dry adiabatic up to the given level.  It can be considered a

      "trigger temperature" for that level.  

Freezing Level - The height where the temperature is zero degrees Celsius.  

Height of Stable Layer - The height (between 12,000 and 18,000 feet above

      mean sea level) where the smallest lapse rate exists.  The location and

      existence of this feature is important in the generation of mountain

      waves.  

K Index - A measure of stability which combines the temperature difference

      between approximately 5,000 and 18,000 feet above the surface, the amount

      of moisture at approximately 5,000 feet above the surface, and a measure

      of the dryness at approximately 10,000 feet above the surface.  Larger

      positive numbers indicate more instability and a greater likelihood of

      thunderstorm development.  One interpretation of K index values regarding

      soaring in the western United States is given in WMO Technical Note 158

      and is reproduced in the following table:  

below -10    no or weak thermals

            -10 to 5    dry thermals or 1/8 cumulus with moderate thermals

             5 to 15    good soaring conditions

            15 to 20    good soaring conditions with occasional showers

            20 to 30    excellent soaring conditions, but increasing

                        probability of showers and thunderstorms

            above 30    more than 60 percent probability of thunderstorms  

Lapse Rate - The change with height of the temperature. Negative values       indicate inversions.  

Lifted Condensation Level - The height to which an air parcel possessing the

      average dewpoint in the lowest 4000 feet of the airmass and the forecast

      maximum temperature must be lifted dry adiabatically to attain saturation.  

Lifted Index - The difference between the environmental temperature at a level

      approximately 18,000 feet above the surface and the temperature of an air

      parcel lifted dry adiabatically from the surface to its lifted condensation

      level and then pseudo adiabatic ally thereafter to this same level.  The

      parcel\`s initial temperature is the forecast maximum temperature and its

      dewpoint is the average dewpoint in the lowest 4000 feet of the airmass.

      Negative values are indicative of instability with positive values showing

      stable conditions.  

Lift Rate - An experimental estimate of the strength of thermals.  It is

      computed the same way as the maximum rate of lift but uses the actual

      level rather than the maximum height of thermals in the calculation.

      Also, none of the empirical adjustments based on cloudiness and K-index

      are applied to these calculations.  

Maximum Height of Thermals - The height where the dry adiabat through the      forecast maximum temperature intersects the environmental temperature.  

The content and format of this report as well as the issuance times are subject to change without prior notice.  Comments and suggestions are welcome and  Maximum Rate of Lift - An estimate of the maximum strength of thermals.  

      It is computed from an empirical formula which combines the expected 

      maximum height of thermals with the difference in the environmental 

      temperatures between the maximum height of thermals and the

      temperature 4,000 feet above the ground.  After this computation, further

      empirical adjustments are made based on the value of the K-index and the

      amount and opacity of middle and high level cloudiness expected between

      the time of trigger temperature and the time of overdevelopment.  

Middle/High Clouds - The amount and opacity of middle (altostratus, 

      altocumulus) or high (cirrus, cirrostatus, cirrocumulus) clouds. Broken

      means that between  $60\%$   and  $90\%$   of the sky is covered by the cloud, with

      overcast conditions occurring when more than  $90\%$   of the sky is covered

      by the cloud. Thin implies that the clouds are predominantly transparent,

      meaning that some sunlight is reaching the ground, in contrast to opaque

      which suggests that little sunlight is reaching the ground.  

Potential Height of Wave - The minimum of the following two heights:

      1. Level above the height of stable layer (or 14,000 feet if none exists)

         where the wind direction changes by 30 degrees or more

      2. Level above the height of stable layer (or 14,000 feet if none exists)

         where the wind speed no longer increases with height  

PVA/NVA - Positive vorticity advection (PVA)/negative vorticity advection 

      (NVA) on the 500 millibar isobaric surface (approximately 18,000 feet 

      above mean sea level).  Weak PVA has been shown to assist in mountain 

      wave soaring.  

Soaring Window - The time between the time the trigger temperature is      reached and the time of overdevelopment.  

Thermal Index - The difference between the environmental temperature and

      the temperature at a particular level determined by following the dry

      adiabat through the forecast maximum temperature up to that level.

      Negative values are indicative of thermal lift.  

Thermal Soaring Index - An adjective rating (for sailplanes) based on the

      computed maximum rate of lift, and the wind speed and middle and high

      cloud cover expected during the soaring window (the time of the trigger

      temperature and the time of overdevelopment) according to the following:  

Maximum rate of lift        Adjective Rating  $\geq800$   fpm                           Excellent  $\geq400$   and  $<800$   fpm              Good  $\geq200$   and  $<400$   fpm              Fair  $<200~\mathrm{fpm}$                           Poor  

Time of Overdevelopment - The time one or more of the following

      phenomena, which essentially shut off thermal lift, is expected to occur:

      1. formation of broken to overcast convective cloud cover

      2. formation of scattered to numerous downbursts

      3. initiation of widespread precipitation  

Time of Trigger Temperature - The time the surface temperature is expected      to reach the trigger temperature.  

Trigger Temperature - The surface temperature required to make the first      4000 feet of the atmosphere dry adiabatic.  

Wave Soaring Index - An empirical, adjective rating (for sailplanes) which

      attempts to combine a variety of phenomena important in mountain wave

      soaring into a single index number.  Objective points are assigned to

      these phenomena: wind speed and direction at 14,000 ft MSL, the static

      stability in the 12,000-18,000 ft MSL layer, the wind speed gradient above

      the stable layer, jet stream location and frontal and upper trough

      movements.

# Interpreting Weather Charts, Reports,  and Forecasts  

Knowing how and where to gather weather information  is important but the ability to interpret and understand the  information requires additional knowledge and practice.  Weather charts and reports are merely records of observed  atmospheric conditions at certain locations at specific times.  Trained observers using electronic instruments, computers,  and personal observations produce the weather products  necessary for pilots to determine if a flight can be conducted  safely. This same information can be used by soaring pilots  to determine where they can find lift and how long the lift is  usable for soaring flight.  

# Graphic Weather Charts  

Reports of observed weather are graphically depicted in a  number of weather products. Among them are the surface  analysis chart, radar summary chart, weather depiction  chart, winds and temperature aloft chart, and the composite  moisture stability chart. For detailed information about  the surface analysis chart, weather depiction charts, and  radar summary chart, refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge and Advisory Circular 00-45G,  “Aviation Weather Services.”  

# Winds and Temperatures Aloft Forecast  

The winds and temperatures aloft forecast (FB) is a 12- hour product that is issued at 0000Z and 1200Z daily.  [Figure 9-34]  It is used primarily to determine expected  wind direction and velocity, and temperatures for the altitude  of a planned cross-country flight. The forecast contains nine  columns that correspond to forecast levels 3,000; 6,000;  9,000; 12,000; 18,000; 24,000; 30,000; 34,000; and 39,000  feet MSL. Soaring pilots planning to attempt proficiency  for altitude should be aware that the levels below 18,000  feet are based on local altimeter settings. Above 18,000  feet, flight levels are based on standard altimeter setting of   $29.92\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  . For example 19,000 feet is FL190. Wind direction  is from true north. No winds are forecast within 1,500 feet of  station elevation. Also, no temperatures are forecast for the  3,000 foot level or for any level within 2,500 feet of station  elevation. Temperature is in whole degrees Celsius and  assumed to be negative above 24,000 feet.  Figure 9-34  shows  an example winds aloft message as well as how to decode it.

This example shows data for MKC (Kansas City, MO). The 3,000 foot wind is  forecast to be 240 degrees at 26 knots. The 6,000 foot wind is forecast to be  270 degrees at 26 knots and the air temperature is forecast to be -9 degrees  Celsius. The 30,000 foot wind is forecast to be 270 degrees at 55 knots with  the air temperature forecast to be -50 degrees Celsius.  

If a coded direction is more than "36," then the wind speed is 100 knots or more.  Therefore, if the direction number is between 51 and 86, the wind speed will be  over 100 knots. For example, a forecast at 39,000 feet of "731960" shows a  wind direction from 230 degrees (73-50=23) and the speed is 119 knots   $(100{+}19{=}119)$  ). The temperature is minus 60 degrees Celcius.  

If the wind speed is forecast to be 200 knots or greater, the wind group is coded  as 199 knots. For example,  $"7799"$   is decoded as 270 degrees at 199 knots or  greater.  Wind direction is coded to the nearest 10 degrees. When the forecast speed is  less than 5 knots, the coded group is  $"9900"$   and read, "LIGHT AND  VARIABLE."

# Composite Moisture Stability Chart  

The composite moisture stability chart is a four-panel chart,  which depicts stability, precipitable water, freezing level,  and average relative humidity. It is a computer-generated  chart derived from upper-air observation data and is available  twice daily with a valid time of 0000Z and 1200Z. This chart  is useful for determining the characteristics of a particular  weather system with regard to atmospheric stability, moisture  content, and possible aviation hazards, such as thunderstorms  and icing.  [Figure 9-35]  

For the purpose of soaring flight, the stability panel located  in the upper left corner of the chart  [Figure 9-35 Panel A] can be useful when obtaining weather as it outlines areas of  stable and unstable air. The numbers on this panel resemble  fractions; the top number is the lifted index (LI) and the  lower number is the K index (KI).  [Figure 9-36]  The LI is  

![](images/1c25655f936b51343ca6052e48d5660570d1a6b25c85742dfcb12d2b4dbf2ca6.jpg)

the difference between the temperature of a parcel of air being  lifted from the surface to the   $500~\mathrm{mb}$   level (approximately  18,000 feet MSL) and the actual temperature at the  $500\;\mathrm{mb}$  level. If the number is positive, the air is considered stable.  For example, a lifted index of   $+8$   is very stable, and the  likelihood of severe thunderstorms is weak. Conversely, an  index of  $^{-6}$   or less is considered very unstable, and severe  thunderstorms are likely to occur; however, the instability  may give rise to favorable soaring conditions. A zero index  is neutrally stable.  [Figure 9-37]  

Caution should be exercised if the K index is high, indicating  moisture is sufficient for storm development. Although the  lifting index may be very negative and good for soaring,  too much moisture can make good soaring conditions very  dangerous once the storms develop. A very negative LI with  high KI may mean a better day to soar close to the gliderport,  whereas very negative LI and low KI values make for clear  soaring conditions in general.

The chart in  Figure 9-37  shows relative instability in two  ways. First, the station circle is darkened when the lift index  is zero or less. Second, solid lines are used to delineate areas  that have an index of   $+4$   or less at intervals of 4   $(+4,0,-4$  ,   $^{-8)}$  . The stability panel is an important preflight planning  tool because the relative stability of an airmass is indicative  of the type of clouds that can be found in a given area. For  example, if the airmass is stable, a pilot can expect smooth  air and, given sufficient moisture, steady precipitation. On the  other hand, if the airmass is unstable, convective turbulence  and showery precipitation can be expected.  

The K index indicates whether the conditions are favorable  for airmass thunderstorms. The K index is based on  temperature, low-level moisture, and saturation. A K index  of 15 or less would be forecast as a 0 percent probability for  airmass thunderstorms, and an index of 40 or more would be  forecast as 100 percent probability.  [Figure 9-38]

# Chapter 10 Soaring Techniques  

# Introduction  

Soaring flight, maintaining or gaining altitude rather than  slowly gliding downward, is the reason most glider pilots  take to the sky. After learning to stay aloft for two or more  hours at a time, the urge to set off cross-country often  overcomes the soaring pilot. The goal is the same whether  on a cross-country or a local flight—to use available updrafts  as efficiently as possible. This involves finding and staying  within the strongest part of the updraft. This chapter covers  the basic soaring techniques.  

In the early 1920s, soaring pilots discovered the ability to  remain aloft using updrafts caused by wind deflected by the  very hillside from which they had launched. This allowed  time aloft to explore the air. Soon afterward, they discovered  thermals in the valleys adjacent to the hills. In the 1930s,  mountain waves, which were not yet well understood by  meteorologists, were discovered, leading pilots to make the  first high altitude flights. Thermals are the most commonly  used type of lift for soaring flight, since they can occur over  flat terrain and in hilly country.  

There are two favored theories of thermal characteristics. One  is that thermals are continuous updrafts like a plume of smoke  from a campfire rising up and sometimes twisting depending  on the wind currents. This theory requires the glider pilot to  locate the rising thermal current and estimate the amount of  slant caused by the winds shifting the rising updraft downwind  from the heat source. Just like a campfire, the winds may tend  to twist and oscillate around the hotter origin.  

The other theory is that thermals can be more like a hot water  bubble rising in a pan on a stove. If you can stay in the bubble,  you can climb. If you spill out of the bubble, there is no lift  even just under where you were climbing because the lift is  not a continuous vertical stream. The glider pilot must search  for the next rising bubble to obtain lift.  

In the practical world, the nature of thermals is probably a  blend of these theories. The sun produces heat, and often that  heating is unequal on the surface of the earth, so winds occur  as natural forces that work to equalize the atmosphere. Some  of these winds are vertical currents. We call them updrafts  and downdrafts. Updrafts provide lift and downdrafts provide  sink. Since the atmosphere always seeks equality, if there  is an updraft, there must be a downdraft or drafts close to  replace the upward flowing air. The goal of soaring pilots is  to maximize time in lifting currents and minimize their time  in sinking currents.  

The contemporary models and experience seem to support  the theory of a central updraft surrounded by compensating  downdrafts. The skill involves staying in the lift as long as  possible and exiting or passing through the sink as quickly  as possible.  

As a note, glider pilots refer to rising air as lift. This is not  the lift generated by the wings as discussed in Chapter 3,  Aerodynamics of Flight. The use of this term may confuse  new pilots, but when used in the context of updrafts, the  energy in a rising column of air is translated as lift. This  chapter refers to lift as the rising air within an updraft and  sink as the descending air in downdrafts.  

# Thermal Soaring  

# Locating Thermals  

When locating and utilizing thermals for soaring flight, called  thermaling, glider pilots must constantly be aware of any  nearby lift indicators. Successful thermaling requires several  steps: locating the thermal, entering the thermal, centering the  thermal, and, finally, leaving the thermal. Keep in mind that  every thermal is unique in terms of size, shape, and strength.  

# Cumulus Clouds  

According to the last chapter, if the air is moist enough  and thermals rise high enough, cumulus clouds, or   $\mathrm{Cu}$  (pronounced like the word “cue”) form. Glider pilots seek Cu  in the developing stage, while the cloud is still being built by  a thermal underneath it. The base of the Cu should be sharp  and well defined. Clouds that have a fuzzy appearance are  likely to be well past their prime and probably have little  lift left or even sink as the cloud dissipates.  [Figure 10-1]  

Judging which clouds have the best chance for a good thermal  takes practice. On any given day, the lifetime of an individual  Cu can differ from previous days, so it becomes important to  observe Cu lifecycle on a particular day. A good looking Cu  may already be dissipating by the time it is reached. Soaring  pilots refer to such Cu as rapid or quick cycling, which means  the Cu forms, matures, and dissipates in a short time. The  lifetime of  $\mathrm{Cu}$   often varies during a given day as well; quick  cycling   $\mathrm{Cu}$   early in the day often become well formed and  longer lived as the day develops.  

Sometimes Cu cover enough of the sky that seeing the cloud  tops becomes difficult. Hence, glider pilots should learn  to read the bases of Cu. Generally, a dark area under the  

![](images/4cb0c1d2a7b81979b4ada74e6a7b88af899a6915a76a935195d3d428af7cd139.jpg)  
Figure 10-1.  Photographs of (A) mature cumulus probably producing good lift, and (B) dissipating cumulus.  

cloud base indicates a deeper cloud and, therefore, a higher  likelihood of a thermal underneath. Also, several thermals  can feed one cloud, and it is often well worth the deviation  to those darker areas under the cloud. At times, an otherwise  flat cloud base under an individual Cu has wisps or tendrils of  cloud hanging down from it, producing a particularly active  area. Cloud hanging below the general base of a Cu indicates  that the air is more moist, and hence more buoyant. Note the  importance of distinguishing features under Cu that indicate  potential lift from virga. Virga is precipitation in the form of  rain, snow, or ice crystals, descending from the cloud base  that is evaporating before it strikes the ground. Virga often  signals that the friendly Cu has grown to cumulus congestus  or thunderstorms.  [Figure 10-2]  

Another indicator that one area of Cu may provide better lift  is a concave region under an otherwise flat cloud base. This  indicates air that is especially warm, and hence more buoyant,  which means stronger lift. This can cause problems for the  unwary pilot, since the lift near cloud base often dramatically  increases, for instance from 400 to 1,000 feet per minute  (fpm). When trying to leave the strong lift in the concave  area under the cloud, pilots can find themselves climbing  rapidly with cloud all around—another good reason to abide  by required cloud clearances. See Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91, section 91.155, Basic  VFR Weather Minimums.  

After a thermal rises from the surface and reaches the  convective condensation level (CCL), a cloud begins to form.  At first, only a few wisps form. Then, the cloud grows to a  cauliflower shape. The initial wisps of  $\mathrm{Cu}$   in an otherwise blue  (cloudless) sky indicate where an active thermal is beginning  to build a cloud. When crossing a blue hole (a region anywhere  from a few miles to several dozen miles of cloud-free sky in  an otherwise  $\mathrm{Cu}$  -filled sky), diverting to an initial wisp of  $\mathrm{Cu}$  is often worthwhile. On some days, when only a few thermals  are reaching the CCL, the initial wisps may be the only cloud  markers around. The trick is to get to the wisp when it first  forms, to catch the thermal underneath.  

Lack of Cu does not necessarily mean lack of thermals. If the  air aloft is cool enough and the surface temperature warms  sufficiently, thermals form whether or not enough moisture  exists for cumulus formation. These dry, or blue thermals  as they are called, can be just as strong as their Cu-topped  counterparts. Glider pilots can find blue thermals, without  Cu markers, by gliding along until stumbling upon a thermal.  With any luck, other blue thermal indicators exist, making  the search less random.  

# Other Indicators of Thermals  

One indicator of a thermal is another circling glider. Often  the glint of the sun on wings is all that can be seen, so finding  other gliders thermaling requires keeping a good lookout,  which glider pilots should be doing anyway. Circling birds  are also good indicators of thermal activity. Thermals tend to  transport various aerosols, such as dust, upward with them.  When a thermal rises to an inversion, it disturbs the stable air  above it and spreads out horizontally, thus depositing some  of the aerosols at that level. Depending on the sun angle and  the pilot’s sunglasses, haze domes can indicate dry thermals.  If the air contains enough moisture, haze domes often form  just before the first wisp of Cu.  

On blue, cloudless days, gliders and other airborne indicators  are not around to mark thermals. In such cases, pay attention  to clues on the ground. First, think about previous flight  experiences. It is worth noting where thermals have been  found previously since certain areas tend to be consistent  thermal sources. Remember that weather is fickle, so there  is never a guarantee that a thermal currently exists where one  existed before. In addition, if a thermal has recently formed,  it takes time for the sun to reheat the area before the next  thermal is triggered. Glider pilots new to a soaring location  should ask the local pilots about favored spots—doing so  might save the cost of a tow. Glider pilots talk about house  thermals, which are simply thermals that seem to form over  and over in the same spot or in the same area.  

Stay alert for other indicators, as well. In drier climates, dust  devils mark thermals triggering from the ground. In hilly or  

![](images/14ea630c6498df28e47ac1ea29a6214e4f126ea88cfa313aec402f4bc200280e.jpg)

mountainous terrain, look for sun-facing slopes. Unless the  sun is directly overhead, the heating of a sun-facing slope is  more intense than that over adjacent flat terrain because the  sun’s radiation strikes the slope at more nearly right angles.  [Figure 10-3]  Also, cooler air usually pools in low-lying  areas overnight; taking longer to warm during the morning.  Darker ground or surface features heat quicker than grass  covered fields. Huge black asphalt parking lots can produce  strong thermals. A large tilled black soil field can be a good  source of lift if the pilot can find the sometimes very narrow  plume of rising air. Finally, slopes often tend to be drier than  surrounding lowlands, and tend to heat better. Given the  choice, it usually pays to look first to the hills for thermals.  

![](images/514beac41ec782d5a1b0ada53007217f89085bcc495319aeb06ba3c70854fcce.jpg)  
Figure 10-3.  Sun’s rays are concentrated in a smaller area on a  hillside than on adjacent flat ground.  

Whether soaring over flat or hilly terrain, some experts  suggest taking a mental stroll through the landscape to look  for thermals. Imagine strolling along the ground where  warmer areas would be found. For instance, walk from  shade into an open field where the air suddenly warms. A  town surrounded by green fields is likely to heat more than  the surrounding farmland. Likewise, a yellowish harvested  field feels warmer than an adjacent wet field with lush  green vegetation. Wet areas tend to use the sun’s radiation  to evaporate the moisture rather than heat the ground.  Thus, a field with a rocky outcrop might produce better  thermals. Rocky outcrops along a snowy slope heat much  more efficiently than surrounding snowfields. Although this  technique works better when at lower altitudes, it can also  be of use at higher altitudes in the sense of avoiding cool- looking areas, such as a valley with many lakes.  

# Wind  

Wind has important influences not only on thermal structure,  but on thermal location as well. Strong winds at the surface  and aloft often break up thermals, making them turbulent and  difficult or impossible to work at all. Strong shear can break  thermals apart and effectively cap their height even though  the local sounding indicates that thermals should extend to  higher levels. On the other hand, as discussed in Chapter 9,  Soaring Weather, moderately strong winds without too much  wind shear sometimes organize thermals into long streets,  a joyous sight when they lie along a cross-country course  line.  [Figure 10-4]  

![](images/273ae8c21691b64f67f591c680dac53f273221542be325d37a64e967bafe395b.jpg)

In lighter wind conditions, consideration of thermal drift is  still important, and search patterns should become “slanted.”  For instance, in Cu-filled skies, glider pilots need to search  upwind of the cloud to find a thermal. How far upwind  depends on the strength of the wind, typical thermal strength  on that day, and distance below cloud base (the lower the  glider, the further upwind the gliders needs to be). The  task can be challenging when you add to this the fact that  windspeed does not always increase at a constant rate with  height, and/or the possibility that wind direction also can  change dramatically with height.  

Wind direction and speed at cloud base can be estimated by  watching the cloud shadows on the ground. The numerous  variables sometimes make it difficult to estimate exactly  where a thermal should be. Pay attention to where thermals  appear to be located in relation to clouds on a given day, and  use this as the search criterion for other clouds on that day. If  approaching Cu from the downwind side, expect heavy sink  near the cloud. Head for the darkest, best defined part of the  cloud base, then continue directly into the wind. Depending  on the distance below cloud base, just about the time of  passing upwind of the cloud, fly directly into the lift forming  the cloud. If approaching the cloud from a crosswind direction  (for instance, heading north with westerly winds), try to  estimate the thermal location from others encountered that  day. If only reduced sink is found, there may be lift nearby,  a short leg upwind or downwind may locate the thermal.  

Thermals drift with the wind on blue days as well, and similar  techniques are required to locate thermals using airborne  or ground-based markers. For instance, if heading toward  a circling glider but at a thousand feet lower, estimate how  much the thermal is tilted in the wind and head for the most  likely spot upwind of the circling glider.  [Figure 10-5]  When  in need of a thermal, pilots might consider searching on a  line upwind or downwind once abeam the circling glider.  This may or may not work; if the thermal is a bubble rather  than a column, the pilot may be below the bubble. It is easy  to waste height while searching in sink near one spot, rather  than leaving and searching for a new thermal. Remember that  a house thermal will probably be downwind of its typical spot  on a windy day. Only practice and experience enable glider  pilots to consistently find good thermals.  

Cool, stable air can also drift with the wind. Avoid areas  downwind of known stable air, such as large lakes or large  irrigated regions. On a day with Cu, stable areas can be  indicated by a big blue hole in an otherwise Cu-filled sky. If  the area is broad enough, a detour upwind of the stabilizing  feature might be in order.  [Figure 10-6]  

# The Big Picture  

When the sky is full of Cu, occasional gliders are marking  thermals, and dust devils move across the landscape, the  sky becomes glider pilot heaven. If gliding in the upper part  of the height band, it is best to focus on the Cu, and make  choices based on the best clouds. Sometimes lower altitudes  cause glider pilots to go out of synch with the cloud. In that  circumstance, use the  $\mathrm{Cu}$   to find areas that appear generally  active, but then start focusing more on ground-based  indicators, like dust devils, a hillside with sunshine on it,  

![](images/41cc0397224d90716c23bacca16269b708c2aa5cae4b49e4bd5e86ceb29e8d9b.jpg)

or a circling bird. When down low, accept weaker climbs.  Often the thermal cycles again, and hard work is rewarded.  

When searching for lift, use the best speed to fly, that is,  best L/D speed plus corrections for sink and any wind. This  technique allows glider pilots to cover the most ground with  the available altitude. See Chapter 3, Aerodynamics of Flight,  to review shifting of the polar for winds and sink.  

# Entering a Thermal  

Once a thermal has been located, enter it so you do not lose  it right away. The first indicator of a nearby thermal is often,  oddly enough, increased sink. Next, a positive G-force is felt,  which may be subtle or obvious, depending on the thermal  strength. The “seat-of-the-pants” indication of lift is the  quickest, and is far faster than any variometer, which has  a small lag. Speed should have been increased in the sink  adjacent to the thermal; as the positive G-force increases,  reduce speed to between L/D and minimum sink. Note the  trend of the variometer needle (should be an upswing) or the  

![](images/d4f9fb03ec9823a91617c6a8c1fd64ebdc2de8eecb9f8c0174db292d09d03faf.jpg)

audio variometer going from the drone to excited beeping.  At the right time in the anticipated lift, begin the turn. If  everything has gone perfectly, the glider will roll into a  coordinated turn, at just the right bank angle, at just the right  speed, and be centered perfectly. In reality, it rarely works  that well.  

Before going further, what vital step was left out of the above  scenario? CLEAR BEFORE TURNING! The variometer  is hypnotic upon entering lift, especially at somewhat low  altitudes. This is exactly where pilots forget that basic  primary step before any turn—looking around first. An audio  variometer helps avoid this.  

To help decide which way to turn, determine which wing  tends to be lifted. For instance, when entering the thermal  and the glider is gently banking to the right, CLEAR LEFT,  then turn left. A glider on its own tends to fly away from  thermals.  [Figure 10-7]  As the glider flies into the first  thermal, but slightly off center, the stronger lift in the center  of the thermal banks the glider right, away from the thermal.  It then encounters the next thermal with the right wing toward  the center and is banked away from lift to the left, and so  on. Avoid letting thermals bank the glider even slightly.  Sometimes the thermal-induced bank is subtle, so be light on  the controls and sensitive to the air activity. At other times,  there is no indication on one wing or another. In this case,  

![](images/67648ea94f5f02a49b36e255dd3e8e9ab76c95b61f2daef0b58a8905b56238f7.jpg)

take a guess, CLEAR, then turn. As a note, new soaring pilots  often get in the habit of turning in a favorite direction, to the  extreme of not being able to fly reasonable circles in the other  direction. If this happens, make an effort to thermal in the other  direction half the time—being proficient in either direction is  important, especially when thermaling with traffic.  

As a glider encounters lift on one side, some gliders tend to  slip laterally as indicated by the yaw string. The glider pilot  must bring the climbing wing down, not just to level the wings  but further to begin the turn into the lifting columns of air.  In these instances, the soaring pilot should turn towards the  tip of the yaw string to seek the lift.  

# Inside a Thermal Bank Angle  

Optimum climb is achieved when proper bank angle and speed  are used after entering a thermal. The shallowest possible  bank angle at minimum sink speed is ideal. Thermal size and  associated turbulence usually do not allow this. Large-size,  smooth, and well-behaved thermals can be the exception  in some parts of the country. Consider first the bank angle.  The glider’s sink rate increases as the bank angle increases.  However, the sink rate begins to increase more rapidly beyond  about a  $45^{\circ}$   bank angle. Thus, a  $40^{\circ}$   compared to a  $30^{\circ}$   bank  angle may increase the sink rate less than the gain achieved  from circling in the stronger lift near the center of the thermal.  As with everything else, this takes practice, and the exact bank  angle used depends on the typical thermal, or even a specific  thermal, on a given day. Normally, bank angles in excess of   $50^{\circ}$   are not needed, but exceptions always exist. It may be  necessary, for instance, to use banks of   $60^{\circ}$   or so to stay in  the best lift. Thermals tend to be smaller at lower levels and  expand in size as they rise higher. Therefore, a steeper bank  angle is required at lower altitudes, and shallower bank angles  can often be used while climbing higher. Remain flexible with  techniques throughout the flight.  

# Speed  

If turbulence is light and the thermal is well formed, use the  minimum sink speed for the given bank angle. This should  optimize the climb because the glider’s sink rate is at its  lowest, and the turn radius is smaller. As an example, for a   $30^{\circ}$   bank angle, letting the speed increase from 45 to 50 knots  increases the diameter of the circle by about 100 feet. In some  instances, this can make the difference between climbing or  not. Some gliders can be safely flown several knots below  minimum sink speed. Even though the turn radius is smaller,  the increased sink rate may offset any gain achieved by being  closer to strong lift near the thermal center.  

There are two other reasons to avoid thermaling speeds that  are too slow: the risk of a stall and lack of controllability.  

Distractions while thermaling can increase the risk of an  inadvertent stall and include, but are not limited to: studying  the cloud above or the ground below (for wind drift), quickly  changing bank angles without remaining coordinated while  centering, thermal turbulence, or other gliders in the thermal.  Stall recovery should be second nature, so that if the signs of an  imminent stall appear while thermaling, recovery is instinctive.  Depending on the stall characteristics of the particular glider  or in turbulent thermals, a spin entry is always possible. Glider  pilots should carefully monitor speed and nose attitude at  lower altitudes. Regardless of altitude, when in a thermal with  other gliders below, maintain increased awareness of speed  control and avoid any stall/spin scenario. Controllability is a  second, though related, reason for using a thermaling speed  greater than minimum sink. The bank angle may justify a  low speed, but turbulence in the thermal may make it difficult  or impossible to maintain the desired quick responsiveness,  especially in aileron control, in order to properly remain in the  best lift. Using sufficient speed ensures that the pilot, and not  the thermal turbulence, is controlling the glider.  

Soaring pilots’ opinions differ regarding how long to wait  after encountering lift and before rolling into the thermal.  Some pilots advocate flying straight until the lift has peaked.  Then, they start turning, hopefully back into stronger lift. It  is imperative not to wait too long after the first indication  that the thermal is decreasing for this maneuver. Other pilots  favor rolling into the thermal before lift peaks, thus avoiding  the possibility of losing the thermal by waiting too long.  Turning into the lift too quickly causes the glider to fly back  out into sink. There is no one right way; the choice depends on  personal preference and the conditions on a given day. Timing  is everything, and practice is key to developing good timing.  

# Centering  

Usually upon entering a thermal, the glider is in lift for part  of the circle and sink for the other part. It is rare to roll into  a thermal and immediately be perfectly centered. The goal  of centering the thermal is to determine where the best lift  is and move the glider into it for the most consistent climb.  One centering technique is known as the   $270^{\circ}$   correction.  [Figure 10-8]  In this case, the pilot rolls into a thermal and  almost immediately encounters sink, an indication of turning  the wrong way. Complete a   $270^{\circ}$   turn, straighten out for a  few seconds, and if lift is encountered again, turn back into  it in the same direction. Avoid reversing the direction of  turn. The distance flown while reversing turns is more than  seems possible and can lead away from the lift completely.  [Figure 10-9]  

Often, stronger lift exists on one side of the thermal than on  the other, or perhaps the thermal is small enough that lift  exists on one side and sink on the other, thereby preventing

a climb. There are several techniques and variations to  centering. One method involves paying close attention to  where the thermal is strongest; for instance, toward the  northeast or toward some feature on the ground. To help  judge this, note what is under the high wing when in the best  lift. On the next turn, adjust the circle by either straightening  or shallowing the turn toward the stronger lift. Anticipate  things and begin rolling out about  $30^{\circ}$   before actually heading  toward the strongest part. This allows rolling back toward  the strongest part of the thermal rather than flying through  the strongest lift and again turning away from the thermal  center. Gusts within the thermal can cause airspeed indicator  variations; therefore, avoid “chasing the airspeed indicator.”  Paying attention to the nose attitude helps pilots keep their  focus outside the cockpit. How long a glider remains shallow  or straight depends on the size of the thermal.  [Figure 10-10] Other variations include the following:  [Figure 10-11]  

1.	 Shallow the turn slightly (consider  $5^{\circ}$   or   $10^{\circ}$  ) when  encountering the weaker lift, then as stronger lift is  encountered again (feel the positive G, variometer  swings up, audio variometer starts to beep) resume the  original bank angle. If shallowing the turn too much,  it is possible to fly completely away from the lift.  

2.	 Straighten or shallow the turn for a few seconds  $60^{\circ}$  after encountering the weakest lifts or worst sink  indicated by the variometer. This allows for the lag in  the variometer since the actual worst sink occurred a  couple of seconds earlier than indicated. Resume the  original bank angle.

Figure 10-10.  Centering by shifting the circle turn toward stronger lift.  

3.	 Straighten or shallow the turn for a few seconds when  the stronger seat-of-the-pants surge is felt. Then,  resume the original bank. Verify with the variometer  trend (needle or audio).

Figure 10-11.  Other centering corrections.  

For the new glider pilots, it is best to become proficient using  one of the above methods first, and then experiment with  other methods. As an additional note, thermals often deviate  markedly from the conceptual model of concentric gradients  of lift increasing evenly toward the center. For instance, it  sometimes feels as if two (or more) nearby thermal centers  exist, making centering difficult. Glider pilots must be willing  to constantly adjust, and recenter the thermal to maintain the  best climb.  

In addition to helping pilots locate lift, other gliders can help  pilots center a thermal as well. If a nearby glider seems to be  climbing better, adjust the turn to fly within the same circle.  Similarly, if a bird is soaring close by, it is usually worth  turning toward the soaring bird. Along with the thrill of  soaring with a hawk or eagle, it usually leads to a better climb.  

# Collision Avoidance  

Collision avoidance is of primary importance when  thermaling with other gliders. The first rule calls for all gliders  in a particular thermal to circle in the same direction. The  first glider in a thermal establishes the direction of turn and  all other gliders joining the thermal should turn in the same  direction. Ideally, two gliders in a thermal at the same height  or nearly so should position themselves across from each  other so they can maintain best visual contact.  [Figure 10-12]   When entering a thermal, strive to do so in a way that does  not interfere with gliders already in the thermal, and above  all, in a manner that does not cause a hazard to other gliders.  An example of a dangerous entry is pulling up to bleed off  excess speed in the middle of a crowded thermal. A far safer  technique is to bleed off speed before reaching the thermal  and joining the thermal at a “normal” thermaling speed.  Collision avoidance, not optimum aerodynamic efficiency, is  the priority when thermaling with other gliders. Announcing  to the other glider(s) on the radio that you are entering the  thermal enhances collision avoidance.  [Figure 10-12]  

Different types of gliders in the same thermal may have  different minimum sink speeds, and it may be difficult to  remain directly across from another glider in a thermal.  Avoid a situation where the other glider cannot be seen or  the other glider cannot see you. Radio communication is  helpful. Too much talking clogs the frequency, and may make  it impossible for a pilot to broadcast an important message.  Do not fly directly above or below another glider in a thermal  since differences in performance, or even minor changes in  speed can lead to larger than expected altitude changes. If  sight of another glider is lost in a thermal and position cannot  be established via a radio call, leave the thermal. After 10 or  20 seconds, come back around to rejoin the thermal, hopefully  with better traffic positioning. It cannot be stressed enough  that collision avoidance when thermaling is a priority! Mid-

Figure 10-12.  Proper positioning with two gliders at the same  altitude. Numbers represent each glider’s position at that time.  

air collisions can sometimes be survived, but only with a  great deal of luck. Unsafe thermaling practices endanger  everyone.  [Figure 10-13]  

# Exiting a Thermal  

Leaving a thermal properly can also save some altitude. While  circling, scan the full  $360^{\circ}$   of sky with each thermaling turn.  This first allows the pilot to continually check for other traffic  in the vicinity. Second, it helps the pilot analyze the sky in all  directions to decide where to go for the next climb. It is better  to decide where to go next while still in lift rather than losing  altitude in sink after leaving a thermal. Exactly when to leave  depends on the goals for the climb—whether the desire is to  maximize altitude for a long glide or leave when lift weakens  in order to maximize time on a cross-country flight. In either  case, be ready to increase speed to penetrate the sink often  found on the edge of the thermal, and leave the thermal in a  manner that does not hinder or endanger other gliders.  

![](images/efd9f8f16d19cf05123bbe7682829a64991ed1965d4fc7f1d14c1264abd25e20.jpg)  
Figure 10-13.  When thermaling, avoid flying in another glider’s  blind spot, or directly above or below another glider.  

# Atypical Thermals  

Exceptions to normal or typical thermals are numerous. For  instance, instead of stronger sink at the edge of a thermal,  weak lift sometimes continues for a distance after leaving a  thermal. Glider pilots should be quick to adapt to whatever the  air has to offer at the time. The mechanics of simply flying the  glider become second nature with practice, as do thermaling  techniques. Expect to land early because anticipated lift was  not there on occasion—it is part of the learning curve.  

If thermal waves are suspected, climb in the thermal near  cloud base, then head toward the upwind side of the Cu.  Often, only very weak lift, barely enough to climb at all, is  found in smooth air upwind of the cloud. Once above cloud  base and upwind of the Cu, climb rates of a few hundred fpm  can be found. Climbs can be made by flying back and forth  upwind of an individual Cu, or by flying along cloud streets if  they exist. If no clouds are present, but waves are suspected,  climb to the top of the thermal and penetrate upwind in search  of smooth, weak lift. Without visual clues, thermal waves  are more difficult to work. Thermal waves are most often  stumbled upon as a pleasant surprise.  

# Ridge/Slope Soaring  

Efficient slope soaring (also called ridge soaring or ridge  running) is fairly easy; simply fly in the updraft along the  upwind side of the ridge. Although the appearance may seem  simple, it is very complicated and can be very hazardous for  the untrained glider pilot. Ridge soaring can also be very  demanding on the glider and the pilot. Even though it is  easy to fly, there are many situations in which a glider pilot  can be exposed to hazards if proper training has not been  received. A thorough preflight and route planning needs to  be accomplished. This planning also includes ridge selection  based on the current winds. The horizontal distance from the  ridge varies with height above the ridge, since the best lift  zone, or optimum lift zones (OLZ) tilts upwind with height  above the ridge. These zones, or OLZ, vary but usually are  slightly off the top of the ridge, with a slight angle into the  prevailing wind. The bottom of the OLZ may be slightly down  from the top line under normal conditions. These OLZ vary  with the size and terrain makeup of the ridge.  [Figure 10-14]  

![](images/93bb8077364fa0705aa49a59630e88bbbcaf302611dd968afe5329ef56d05f3b.jpg)  
Figure 10-14.  Optimum lift zone of a ridge.  

Surface winds of 15–20 knots that are perpendicular to the  ridge are ideal. Wind flow within   $45^{\circ}$   of the perpendicular  line also provides adequate lift. Winds less than 10 knots  have also produced adequate ridge soaring dependent on  the terrain, but with 10 knots of wind or less, pilots should  avoid flying low over any ridge due to the possibility of  encountering sink. Local ridge pilots know about of these  conditions and the need for good preflight planning and  training is required.  [Figure 10-15]  

•	 Airflow mirrors a hill or ridge shape. Imagine a flow of  water around the ridge instead of air. However, air is  thinner and can be compressed as in a “venturi effect”  and can be “squeezed” and accelerated, especially  along the ridge.  [Figure 10-16] •	 Ridges that have an irregular profile are hazardous.  The more complicated the ridge is, the more erratic  the airflow may become.  [Figure 10-17]  

# Traps  

Even though the idea is simple, traps exist for both new and  expert glider pilots. Obtain instruction when first learning to  ridge soar/slope soar. Avoid approaching from the upwind  side perpendicularly to the ridge. Instead, approach the ridge  

![](images/fc2cd59a488b47f77867276032c8b09b89359ed251b7b1900f23406b3f57eaf6.jpg)  
Figure 10-15.  Ridge wind flow.  

at a  $45^{\circ}$   angle, so that a quick egress away from the ridge is  possible should lift not be contacted.  

NOTE: When approaching the ridge from downwind,  approach the ridge at a diagonal. If excess sink is encountered,  this method allows a quick turn away from the ridge.  [Figure 10-18]  

While flying along the ridge, a crab angle is necessary to  avoid drifting too close to the ridge or, if gliding above the  ridge, to avoid drifting over the top into the leeside downdraft.  

Thermal sink can turn the glider upside down, a phenomenon  known as upset. A thermal may appear anywhere. When it  appears from the opposite side of the ridge, it has strong  energy. When flying in strong conditions (winds and  thermals), fly with extra speed for positive control of the  glider. DO NOT fly on the ridge crest or below the ridge on  the downwind side.  [Figure 10-19]  

For the new glider pilot, crabbing along the ridge may be a  strange sensation, and it is easy to become uncoordinated  while trying to point the nose along the ridge. This is both  

![](images/6f4f7f1e104a3ed07745b9249cdd2371ffe503f2af9a9e0227fbb2b90eb9c09a.jpg)

inefficient and dangerous, since it leads to a skid toward the  ridge.  [Figure 10-20]  

In theory, to obtain the best climb, it is best to slope soar at  minimum sink speed. However, flying that slowly may be  unwise for two reasons. First, minimum sink speed is relatively  close to stall speed, and flying close to stall speed near terrain  

![](images/46e0febc7e784d01eeed710233fb447cbcc539baec977029630033fc8fd535f4.jpg)

has obvious dangers. Second, maneuverability at minimum  sink speed may be inadequate for proper control near terrain,  especially if the wind is gusty and/or thermals are present.  When gliding at or below ridge top height, fly faster than  minimum sink speed—how much faster depends on the glider,  terrain, and turbulence. When the glider is at least several  hundred feet above the ridge and shifting upwind away from  it in the best lift zone, reduce speed. If in doubt, fly faster.  

NOTE: When flying close to the ridge, use extra speed for  safety—extra speed gives the glider more positive flight  control input and also enables the glider to fly through areas  of sink quickly. Ensure that seat and lap belts are tightened.  [Figure 10-21]  

# Procedures for Safe Flying  

Slope soaring comes with several procedures to enable safe  flying and to allow many gliders on the same ridge. The rules  are explained in the following paragraphs and illustrated in  Figure 10-22 .  

Make all turns away from the ridge.  [Figure 10-22A]  A turn  toward the ridge is dangerous, even if gliding seemingly well  away from the ridge. The groundspeed on the downwind  portion of the turn is difficult to judge properly, and striking  the ridge is a serious threat. Even if above the ridge, it is easy  to finish the turn downwind which may take the glider over  the ridge crest; this puts the glider into heavy sink.  

Do not fly directly above or below another glider.  [Figure 10-22B]  Gliders spaced closely together in the  vertical are in each other’s blind spots. A slight change in  climb rate between the gliders can lead to a collision.  

Pass another glider on the ridge side, anticipating that  the other pilot will make a turn away from the ridge.  [Figure 10-22C]  Sometimes the glider to be passed is so close  to the ridge that there is inadequate space to pass between

the glider and the ridge. In that case, either turn back in the  other direction (away from the ridge) if traffic permits or  fly upwind away from the ridge and rejoin the slope lift as  traffic allows. If using a radio, try to contact the glider by the  completion number and then coordinate the passing. When  soaring outside of the United States, be aware that this rule  may differ.  

The glider with its right side to the ridge has the right of way. 

 [Figure 10-22D]  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations 

 (14 CFR) requires both aircraft approaching head-on to give  way to the right. A glider with the ridge to the right may  not have room to move in that direction. The glider with its  left side to the ridge should give way. Additionally, when  overtaking a slower glider along the ridge, always pass  on the ridge side. If the overtaking glider encounters sink,  turbulence, etc., it must maneuver away from the ridge. This  is acceptable. When piloting the glider with its right side  to the ridge, ensure the approaching glider sees you and is  yielding in plenty of time. In general, gliders approaching  head-on are difficult to see; therefore, extra vigilance is  needed to avoid collisions while slope soaring. The use of a  radio during ridge soaring is recommended. Pilots must be  familiar with 14 CFR part 91, section 91.113, Right-of-way  rules: Except water operations, and section 91.111, Operating  near other aircraft.  

# Bowls and Spurs  

If the wind is at an angle to the ridge, bowls or spurs (i.e.,  recessed or protruding rock formations) extending from the  main ridge can create better lift on the upwind side and sink  on the downwind side. If at or near the height of the ridge,  it may be necessary to detour around the spur to avoid the  sink, then drift back into the bowl to take advantage of the  better lift. After passing such a spur, do not make abrupt  turns toward the ridge. Always consider what the general  flow of traffic is doing. If soaring hundreds of feet above a  spur, it may be possible to fly over it and increase speed in  any sink. This requires caution since a thermal in the upwind  bowl, or even an imperceptible increase in the wind, can  cause greater than anticipated sink on the downwind side.  Always have an escape route or, if in any doubt, detour  around.  [Figure 10-23]  

# Slope Lift  

It is not uncommon for thermals to exist with slope lift.  Indeed, slope soaring can often be used as a “save” when  thermals have temporarily shut down. Working thermals  from slope lift requires special techniques. When a thermal is  encountered along the ridge, a series of S-turns can be made  into the wind. Drift back to the thermal after each turn if  needed and, of course, never continue the turn to the point that  

![](images/a246fb0fa684ba48fb07dbb41763990676dd8364dd0046e06df58128674541a6.jpg)

Figure 10-23.  Avoid sink on the downwind side of spurs by detouring  around them.  

the glider is turning toward the ridge. Speed is also important,  since it is easy to encounter strong sink on the sides of the  thermal. It is very likely that staying in thermal lift through  the entire S-turn is not possible. The maneuver takes practice,  but when done properly, a rapid climb in the thermal can be  made well above the ridge crest, where thermaling turns can  begin. Even when well above the ridge, caution is needed to  ensure the climb is not too slow as to drift into the lee-side  sink. Before trying an S-turn, make sure it would not interfere  with other traffic along the ridge.  [Figure 10-24]  

A second technique for catching thermals when slope soaring  is to head upwind away from the ridge. This works best when  Cu mark potential thermals, and aids timing. If no thermal is  found, the pilot should cut the search short while still high  enough to dash back downwind to the safety of the slope  lift.  [Figure 10-25]  

# Obstructions  

As a final note, caution is also needed to avoid obstructions  when slope soaring. Obstructions include wires, cables, and  power lines, all of which are very difficult to see. When  flying at extremely low altitudes along the ridge (tree top  level), the glider and pilot may be placed at a high risk of  collision with wires. Ensure an adequate reconnaissance has  been completed when flying at these altitudes. Aeronautical  charts show high-tension towers that have many wires  between them. Soaring pilots familiar with the area should

be able to provide useful information on any problems with  the local ridge.  

# Tips and Techniques  

Observe the ridges slope for collectors or dividers of the wind  flow. Plan to determine which of the slopes is gathering wind  flow.  [Figure 10-26]  Due to the changes in wind directions  and or sun angles, any portion on the ridge can change in  only a few minutes.  

•	 Collectors are mountain/ridge bowls and canyon ends  that can offer extreme areas of lift when the wind is  blowing into them. Remember to have a way out. •	 Dividers are ridges parallel with the wind and tend  to have airflow separation. A collector that may be  downwind from a divider may receive more airflow,  making better lift possible.  

![](images/d58db6fa8b716689577ed9729ef234a71de89ebed335eade5d8f382cce7aa699.jpg)  
Figure 10-26.  Analyze sloping ground for collectors and dividers  of wind.  

The downwind side of any ridge or hill produces turbulence  and sink. The larger or higher the ridge and the greater the  wind velocity, the wider the turbulence may be. During  these conditions, remember to ensure that seat and shoulder  harnesses are tight. Sink calls for speed. Turbulence and  speed are very hard on the glider airframe and pilot comfort.  Pilots must obey glider limitations set forth in the GFM/ POH. Also, do not exceed the design speed for maximum  gust intensity   $(\mathrm{V_{b})}$  .  [Figure 10-27]  

The ridge crest is where all airflow starts down. Steep ridges  with narrow ridge tops can collect thermal action from both  sides of the crest. The best lift could be directly above the  crest. However, this terrain can be very hazardous as a pilot  cannot see it or may not have visual cues. If wind is the only  source of lift, the crest can be very dangerous. Always stay  upwind of the crest.  [Figure 10-28]  

Areas along the ridge that are in deep shade is where the air  goes down and sink can be found. If there is strong lift on  the sunny side of the ridge, then chances are that strong sink

Figure 10-29.  Deep shade is where colder air goes down.  

Thermal source can be found where drainages area along the  ridge meet. Where the ridge or peaks are numerous and slope  down into a valley, thermal sources may be found. Canyons  or large bowls hold areas of warm air.  

Ridges may form cloud streets above the ridge. A glider pilot  should try to climb in a thermal to reach these streets. Fast  cruising speeds can be found under these streets. The glider  pilot must stay upwind to stay in this type of lift near the ridge.  

Since gliders tend to seek the same conditions for lift,  thermals and areas of ridge lift are areas for special diligence  for avoiding other aircraft.  To some extent, for the same  reasons that gliders seek rising air, other low flying airplanes  and helicopters will plan to use that area for flights, so be  aware for all aircraft.  A portable VHF radio and sharing  a common channel for traffic calls is an enhancement for  safety, but nothing replaces a good visual scan at all times  looking for other aircraft.  

Density altitude is increasing as the glider climbs. At 10,000  feet mean sea level (MSL), a pilot is required to have  approximately 40 to 45 percent more room to maneuver a  glider. The air is less dense by 2 percent per one thousand  feet of altitude gained.  [Figure 10-30]  

# Wave Soaring  

Almost all high-altitude flights are made using mountain lee  waves. As covered in Chapter 9, Soaring Weather, lee wave  systems can contain tremendous turbulence in the rotor, while  the wave flow itself is usually unbelievably smooth. In more  recent years, the use of lee waves for cross-country soaring  has led to flights exceeding 1,500 miles, with average speeds  of over 100 mph.  [Figure 10-31]  

can be found on the shady or dark side of the ridge. This  is true when the sun angle is low or late in the afternoon.  [Figure 10-29]

Figure 10-31.  Rotor and cap clouds with lenticulars above.  

# Preflight Preparation  

The amount of preflight preparation depends on the height  potential of the wave itself. Assume that the pilot is planning  a flight above 18,000 feet MSL during the winter. (Pilots  planning wave flights to much lower altitudes can reduce  the list of preparation items accordingly.)  

At all times during flights above 14,000 feet MSL, and for  flights of more than 30 minutes above 12,500 feet MSL up to  and including 14,000 feet MSL, 14 CFR states that required  crewmembers must use supplemental oxygen. Pilots must  be aware of their own physiology; however, it may be wise  to use oxygen at altitudes well below 14,000 feet MSL. In  addition, pilots should recognize signs of hypoxia.  

When flying at higher altitudes, the inside of the glider  can get cold. The portions of your body exposed to the sun  through the canopy might feel comfortable but your feet will  probably feel the temperature drop and could get cold. It is  important to prepare for this and pack thermal underwear,  wear warm socks and shoes and have gloves easily accessible  during the flight.  

Within the continental United States, Class A airspace lies  between 18,000 and 60,000 feet MSL (flight level (FL) 180  to FL 600). Generally, flights in Class A airspace must be  conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR). However,  several clubs and glider operations have established so-called  wave windows. These are special areas, arranged in agreement  with air traffic control (ATC), in which gliders are allowed to  operate above 18,000 feet MSL under visual flight rules (VFR)  operations. Wave windows have very specific boundaries.  Thus, to maintain this privilege, it is imperative to stay within  the designated window. On any given day, the wave window  may be opened to a specific altitude during times specified by  ATC. Each wave window has its own set of procedures agreed  upon with ATC. All glider pilots should become familiar with  the procedures and required radio frequencies.  

True airspeed (TAS) becomes a consideration at higher  altitudes. To avoid the possibility of flutter, some gliders  require a reduced indicated never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$   as  a function of altitude. For instance, the Pilot’s Operating  Handbok (POH) for one common two-seat glider, list a  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  at sea level of 135 knots. However, at 19,000 feet MSL, it  is only 109 knots. Study the glider’s POH carefully for any  limitations on indicated airspeeds.  

There is always the possibility of not contacting the wave.  Sink on the downside of a lee wave can be high—2,000 fpm  or more. In addition, missing the wave often means a trip  back through the turbulent rotor. The workload and stress  level in either case can be high. To reduce the workload, it  is a good idea to have minimum return altitudes from several  locations calculated ahead of time. In addition, plan for some  worse case scenarios. For instance, consider what off-field  landing options are available if the planned minimum return  altitude proves inadequate.  

A normal preflight of the glider should be performed. In  addition, check the lubricant that has been used on control  fittings. Some lubricants can become very stiff when cold.  Also, check for water from melting snow or a recent rain in the  spoilers or dive brakes. Freezing water in the spoilers or drive  brakes at altitude can make them difficult to open. Checking the  spoilers or dive brakes occasionally during a high climb helps  avoid this problem. A freshly charged battery is recommended,  since cold temperatures can reduce battery effectiveness.  

Check the radio and accessory equipment, such as a  microphone in the oxygen mask even if it is not generally  used. As mentioned, the oxygen system is vital. Other specific  items to check depend on the system being used.  

A briefing with the tow pilot is even more important before  a wave tow. Routes, minimum altitudes, rotor avoidance (if  possible), anticipated tow altitude, and eventualities should  be discussed on the ground prior to flight.  

After all preparations are complete, it is time to get in the  glider. Some pilots may be using a parachute for the first time  on wave flights, so become familiar with its proper fitting  and use. The parachute fits on top of clothing that is much  bulkier than for normal soaring, so the cockpit can suddenly  seem quite cramped. It takes several minutes to get settled and  organized. Make sure radio and oxygen are easily accessible.  If possible, the oxygen mask should be in place, since the  climb in the wave can be very rapid. At the very least, the mask  should be set up so that it is ready for use in a few seconds.  All other gear (mittens, microphone, maps, barograph, etc.)  should be securely stowed in anticipation of the rotor. Check  for full, free rudder movement since footwear is probably  larger than normal. In addition, given the bulky cold-weather  clothing, check to make sure the canopy clearance is adequate.  The pilot’s head can break a canopy in rotor turbulence, so  seat and shoulder belts should be tightly secured. This may be  difficult to achieve with the extra clothing and accessories, but  take the time to ensure everything is secure. There will not be  time to attend to such matters once the rotor is encountered.  

# Getting Into the Wave  

There are two ways to get into the wave: soaring into it or  being towed directly into it. Three main wave entries while  soaring are thermaling into the wave, climbing the rotor, and  transitioning into the wave from slope soaring.  

At times, an unstable layer lower than the mountaintop is capped  by a strong, stable layer. If other conditions are favorable, the  overlying stable layer may support lee waves. On these days,  it is sometimes possible to avoid the rotor and thermal into the  wave. Whether lee waves are suspected or not, the air near the  thermal top may become turbulent. At this point, attempt a  penetration upwind into smooth wave lift. A line of cumulus  downwind of and aligned parallel to the ridge or mountain range  is a clue that waves may be present.  [Figure 10-32]  

Another possibility is to tow into the upside of the rotor, then  climb the rotor into the wave. This can be rough, difficult, and  prone to failure. The technique is to find a part of the rotor  that is going up and try to stay in it. The rotor lift is usually  stationary over the ground. Either perform a figure 8 in the  rotor lift to avoid drifting downwind, fly several circles with  an occasional straight leg, or fly straight into the wind for  several seconds until lift diminishes. Then, circle to reposition  in the lift. The choice that works depends on the size of the  lift and the wind strength. Since rotors have rapidly changing  regions of very turbulent lift and sink, simple airspeed and  bank angle control can become difficult. This wave-entry  technique is not for new pilots.  

Depending on the topography near the soaring site, it may be  possible to transition from slope lift into a lee wave that is  created by upwind topography as shown in  Figure 9-27 . In  this case, climb as high as possible in slope lift, then penetrate  upwind into the lee wave. When the lee waves are in phase  with the topography, it is often possible to climb from slope to  wave lift without the rotor. At times, the glider pilot may not  realize wave has been encountered until finding lift steadily  increasing as the glider climbs from the ridge. Climbing in  slope lift and then turning downwind to encounter possible  lee waves produced downwind of the ridge is generally not  recommended. Even with a tailwind, the lee-side sink can  put the glider on the ground before the wave is contacted.

Figure 10-32.  Thermaling into wave.  

Towing into the wave can be accomplished by either towing  ahead of the rotor or through the rotor. Complete avoidance  of the rotor generally increases the tow pilot’s willingness to  perform future wave tows. If possible, tow around the rotor  and then directly into the wave lift. This may be feasible if the  soaring site is located near one end of the wave-producing ridge  or mountain range. A detour around the rotor may require more  time on tow, but it is well worth the diversion.  [Figure 10-33]  

Often, a detour around the rotor is not possible and a tow  directly through the rotor is the only route to the wave. The  rotor turbulence is, on rare occasion, only light. However,  moderate to severe turbulence is usually encountered. The  nature of rotor turbulence differs from turbulent thermal  days, with sharp, chaotic horizontal and vertical gusts along  with rapid accelerations and decelerations. At times, the rotor  can become so rough that even experienced pilots may elect  to remain on the ground. Any pilot inexperienced in flying  through rotors should obtain instruction before attempting  a tow through rotor.  

When towing through a rotor, being out of position is  normal. Glider pilots must maintain position horizontally and  vertically as best they can. Pilots should also be aware that an  immediate release may be necessary at any time if turbulence  becomes too violent. Slack-producing situations are common,  due to a rapid deceleration of the towplane. The glider pilot  must react quickly to slack if it occurs and recognize that  slack is about to occur and correct accordingly. The vertical  position should be the normal high tow. Any tow position  that is lower than normal runs the risk of the slack line  coming back over the glider. On the other hand, care should  be taken to tow absolutely no higher than normal to avoid  a forced release should the towplane suddenly drop. Gusts  may also cause an excessive bank of the glider, and it may  take a moment to roll back to level. Full aileron and rudder  deflection, held for a few seconds, is sometimes needed.  

Progress through the rotor is often indicated by noting the  trend of the variometer. General downswings are replaced by  general upswings, usually along with increasing turbulence.  The penetration into the smooth wave lift can be quick—in a  matter of few seconds—while at other times it can be more  gradual. Note any lenticulars above; a position upwind of  the clouds helps confirm contact with the wave. If in doubt,  tow a few moments longer to be sure. Once confident about  having contacted the wave lift, make the release. If heading  into more or less crosswind, the glider should release and fly  straight or with a crab angle. If flying directly into the wind,  the glider should turn a few degrees to establish a crosswind  crab angle. The goal is to avoid drifting downwind and  immediately losing the wave. After release, the towplane  should descend and/or turn away to separate from the glider.  Possible nonstandard procedures need to be briefed with the  tow pilot before takeoff.  [Figures 10-34  and  10-35]

# Flying in the Wave  

Once the wave has been contacted, the best techniques for  utilizing the lift depend on the extent of the lift (especially  in the direction along the ridge or mountain range producing  the wave) and the strength of the wind. The lift may initially  be weak. In such circumstances, be patient and stay with the  initial slow climb. Patience is usually rewarded with better  lift as the climb continues. At other times, the variometer  may be pegged at 1,000 fpm directly after release from tow.  

If the wind is strong enough (40 knots or more), find the  strongest portion of the wave and point into the wind, and  adjust speed so that the glider remains in the strong lift. The  best lift is found along the upwind side of the rotor cloud or  just upwind of any lenticulars. In the best-case scenario, the  required speed is close to the glider’s minimum sink speed.  In quite strong winds, it may be necessary to fly faster than  minimum sink to maintain position in the best lift. Under those  conditions, flying slower allows the glider to drift downwind  (fly backward over the ground) and into the down side of  the wave. This can be a costly mistake since it is difficult  to penetrate back into the strong headwind. When the lift is  strong, it is easy to drift downwind while climbing into stronger  winds aloft, so it pays to be attentive to the position relative to  

rotor clouds or lenticulars. If no clouds exist, special attention  is needed to judge wind drift by finding nearby ground  references. It may be necessary to increase speed with altitude  to maintain position in the best lift. Often the wind is strong,  but not quite strong enough for the glider to remain stationary  over the ground so that the glider slowly moves upwind out of  the best lift. If this occurs, turn slightly from a direct upwind  heading, drift slowly downwind into better lift, and turn back  into the wind before drifting too far.  [Figure 10-36]  

![](images/b86b0aed3d71eea9300e6f9e27ea6141743e2a784bbb6a31695441697167cce6.jpg)  
Figure 10-36.  Catching a thermal by flying upwind away from  the slope lift.  

Often, the wave lift is not perfectly stationary over the ground  since small changes in windspeed and/or stability can alter the  wavelength of the lee wave within minutes. If lift begins to  decrease while climbing in the wave, one of these things has  occurred: the glider is nearing the top of the wave, the glider  has moved out of the best lift, or the wavelength of the lee  wave has changed. In any case, it is time to explore the area  for better lift, and it is best to search upwind first. Searching  upwind first allows the pilot to drift downwind back into the  up part of the wave if he or she is wrong. Searching downwind  first can make it difficult or impossible to contact the lift  again if sink on the downside of the wave is encountered. In  addition, caution is needed to avoid exceeding the glider’s  maneuvering speed or rough-air redline, since a penetration  from the down side of the wave may put the glider back in  the rotor.  [Figure 10-37]  

If the winds are moderate (20 to 40 knots), and the wave  extends along the ridge or mountain range for a few miles, it  is best to fly back and forth along the wave lift while crabbing  into the wind. This technique is similar to slope soaring,  using the rotor cloud or lenticular as a reference. All turns  

![](images/7d5fee0f369fc758c84fbdb4167a6b0a658728a773aeb77043609a51a4484689.jpg)  
Figure 10-37.  Search upwind first to avoid sink behind the wave  crest or the rotor.  

should be into the wind to avoid being on the down side of  the wave or back into the rotor. Once again, it is easy to drift  downwind into sink while climbing higher, and searching  for better lift should be done upwind first. When making  an upwind turn to change course   $180^{\circ}$  , remember that the  heading change will be less, depending on the strength of  the wind. Note the crab angle needed to stay in lift on the  first leg, and assume that same crab angle after completing  the upwind turn. This prevents the glider from drifting too  far downwind upon completing the upwind turn. With no  cloud, ground references are used to maintain the proper crab  angle, and avoid drifting downwind out of the lift. While  climbing higher into stronger winds, it may become possible  to transition from crabbing back and forth to a stationary  upwind heading.  [Figure 10-38]  

Weaker winds (15 to 20 knots) sometimes require different  techniques. Lee waves from smaller ridges can form in  relatively weak winds of approximately 15 knots. Wave lift  from larger mountains rapidly decreases when climbing to a  height where winds aloft diminish. As long as the lift area is  big enough, use a technique similar to that used in moderate  winds. Near the wave top, there sometimes remains only  a small area that still provides lift. In order to attain the  maximum height, fly shorter figure 8 patterns within the  remaining lift. If the area of lift is so small that consistent  climb is not possible, fly a series of circles with an occasional  leg into the wind to avoid drifting too far downwind. Another  possibility is an oval-shaped pattern—fly straight into the wind  in lift and, as it diminishes, fly a quick  $360^{\circ}$   turn to reposition.  These last two techniques do not work as well in moderate  winds, and not at all in strong winds since it is too easy to  be downwind of the lift and into heavy sink.  [Figure 10-39]  

![](images/3353ad2531365f4971f537404aa6b3588ada169f59c7bbd6fa63f2d2a903716d.jpg)  
Figure 10-38.  Proper crabbing to stay in lift and effects of upwind  turn (correct) or downwind turn (incorrect).  

In the discussion thus far, a climb in the primary wave has been  assumed. It is also possible to climb in the secondary or tertiary  lee wave (if existing on a given day) and then penetrate into  the next wave upwind. The success of this depends on wind  strength, clouds, the intensity of sink downwind of wave crests,  and the performance of the glider. Depending on the height  attained in the secondary or tertiary lee wave, a trip through the  rotor of the next wave upwind is a distinct possibility. Caution  is needed if penetrating upwind at high speed. The transition  into the downwind side of the rotor can be as abrupt as on the  upwind side, so speed should be reduced at the first hint of  turbulence. In any case, expect to lose a surprising amount of  altitude while penetrating upwind through the sinking side of  the next upwind wave.  [Figure 10-40]  

If a quick descent is needed or desired, the sink downwind of  the wave crest can be used. Sink can easily be twice as strong  as lift encountered upwind of the crest. Eventual descent into  downwind rotor is also likely. Sometimes the space between  a rotor cloud and overlying lenticulars is inadequate and  a transition downwind cannot be accomplished safely. In  this case, a crosswind detour may be possible if the wave  is produced by a relatively short ridge or mountain range.  If clouds negate a downwind or crosswind departure from  the wave, a descent on the upwind side of the wave crest  is needed. Spoilers or dive brakes may be used to descend  through the updraft, followed by a transition under the rotor  cloud and through the rotor. A descent can be achieved by  moving upwind of a very strong wave lift if spoilers or dive  brakes alone do not allow an adequately fast descent. A trip  back through the rotor is at best unpleasant. At worst, it can  be dangerous if the transition back into the rotor is done with  too much speed. In addition, strong wave lift and lift on the  upwind side of the rotor may make it difficult to stay out of  the rotor cloud. This wave descent requires a good deal of  caution and emphasizes the importance of an exit strategy  before climbing too high in the wave, keeping in mind that  conditions and clouds can rapidly evolve during the climb.  

Some of the dangers and precautions associated with wave  soaring have already been mentioned. Those and others are  summarized below.  

•	 If any signs of hypoxia appear, check the oxygen system  and immediately begin a descent to lower altitudes  below which oxygen is not needed. Do not delay! •	 Eventually, a pilot becomes cold at altitude regardless  of how warmly the pilot is dressed. Descend well  before it becomes uncomfortably cold.

Figure 10-40.  Possible flightpath while transitioning from the tertiary into the secondary and then into the primary.  

•	 Rotor turbulence can be severe or extreme. Caution is  needed on tow and when transitioning from smooth  wave flow (lift or sink) to rotor. Rotors near the  landing area can cause strong shifting surface winds  of 20 or 30 knots. Wind shifts up to   $180^{\circ}$   sometimes  occur in less than a minute at the surface under rotors. •	 Warm, moist exhaled air can cause frost on the canopy,  restricting vision. Opening air vents may alleviate the  problem or delay frost formation. Clear vision panels  may also be installed. If frost cannot be controlled,  descend before frost becomes a hazard. •	 In wet waves, those associated with a great deal of  cloud, beware of the gaps closing beneath the glider.  If trapped above cloud, a benign spiral mode is an  option, but only if this mode has been previously  explored and found stable for the glider. •	 Know the time of actual sunset. At legal sunset, bright  sunshine is still found at 25,000 feet while the ground  below is already quite dark. Even at an average 1,000  fpm descent, it takes 20 minutes to lose 20,000 feet.  

Caution: Flights under a rotor cloud can encounter high sink  rates and should be approached with extreme caution.  

# Soaring Convergence Zones  

Convergence zones are most easily spotted when cumulus  clouds are present. They appear as a single, straight, or curved  cloud street, sometimes well defined and sometimes not. The  edge of a field of cumulus can mark convergence between  a mesoscale air mass that is relatively moist and/or unstable  from one that is much drier and/or more stable. Often, the  cumulus along convergence lines have a base lower on one  side than the other, similar to that in  Figure 9-31 .  

With no cloud present, a convergence zone is sometimes  marked by a difference in visibility across it, which may be  subtle or distinct. When there are no clues in the sky itself,  there may be some clues on the ground. If lakes are nearby,  look for wind differences on lakes a few miles apart. A lake  showing a wind direction different from the ambient flow for  the day may be a clue. Wind direction shown by smoke can  also be an important indicator. A few dust devils, or—even  better—a short line of them, may indicate the presence of  ordinary thermals versus those triggered by convergence.  Spotting subtle clues takes practice and good observational  skills, and is often the reason a few pilots are still soaring  while others are already on the ground.  

The best soaring technique for this type of lift depends on  the nature of the convergence zone itself. For instance, a  sea-breeze front may be well defined and marked by curtain  clouds; the pilot can fly straight along the line in fairly  steady lift. A weaker convergence line often produces more  lift than sink; the pilot must fly slower in lift and faster in  sink. An even weaker convergence line may simply serve as  focus for more frequent thermals; normal thermal techniques  are used along the convergence line. Some combination of  straight legs along the line with an occasional stop to thermal  is often used.  

Convergence zone lift can at times be somewhat turbulent,  especially if air from different sources is mixing, such as  along a sea-breeze front. The general roughness may be  the only clue of being along some sort of convergence line.  There can also be narrow and rough (but strong) thermals  within the convergence line. Work these areas like any other  difficult thermals, using steeper bank angles and more speed  for maneuverability.  

# Combined Sources of Updrafts  

Finally, lift sources have been categorized into four types:  thermal, slope, wave, and convergence. Often, more than  one type of lift exists at the same time, such as thermals  with slope lift, thermaling into a wave, convergence zones  enhancing thermals, thermal waves, and wave and slope lift.  In mountainous terrain, it is possible for all four lift types  to exist on a single day. The glider pilot needs to remain  mentally nimble to take advantage of various types and  locations of rising air during the flight.  

Nature does not know that it must only produce rising air  based on these four lift categories. Sources of lift that do  not fit one of the four lift types discussed probably exist.  For instance, there have been a few reports of pilots soaring  in travelling waves, the source of which was not known. At  some soaring sites, it is sometimes difficult to classify the  type of lift. This should not be a problem. Simply work the  mystery lift as needed, then ponder its nature after the flight.  

# Cross-Country Soaring  

# Introduction  

A cross-country flight is defined as one in which the glider has  flown beyond gliding distance from the local soaring site. Cross- country soaring seems simple enough in theory; in reality, it  requires a great deal more preparation and decision-making than  local soaring flights. Items that must be considered during cross- country flights are how good the thermals ahead are, and if they  will remain active, what the landing possibilities are, which airport  along the course has a runway that is favorable for the prevailing  wind conditions. What effect will the headwind have on the glide?  What is the best speed to fly in sink between thermals?  

Flying cross-country using thermals is the basis of this chapter. A  detailed description of cross-country soaring using ridge or wave  lift is beyond the scope of this chapter.  

# Flight Preparation and Planning  

Adequate soaring skills form the basis of the pilot’s  preparation for cross-country soaring. Until the pilot has  flown several flights in excess of 2 hours and can locate  and utilize thermals consistently, the pilot should focus on  improving those skills before attempting cross-country flights.  

Any cross-country flight may end in an off-field landing, so  short-field landing skills are essential. These landings should  be practiced on local flights by setting up a simulated off-field  landing area. Care is needed to avoid interfering with the  normal flow of traffic during simulated off-field landings. The  first few simulated landings should be done with an instructor,  and several should be done without the use of the altimeter.  

The landing area can be selected from the ground, but the  best training is selecting one from the air. A self-launching  glider or other powered aircraft for landing area selection  training and simulated approaches to these areas is a good  investment, if one is available.  

Once soaring skills have been honed, the pilot needs to be  able to determine position along a route of flight. A Sectional  Aeronautical Chart, or sectional, is a map soaring pilots  use during cross-country flights. They are updated every 6  months and contain general information, such as topography,  cities, major and minor roads and highways, lakes, and other  features that may stand out from the air, such as a ranch in  an otherwise featureless prairie. In addition, sectionals show  the location of private and public airports, airways, restricted  and warning areas, and boundaries and vertical limits of  different classes of airspace. Information on airports includes  field elevation, orientation and length of all paved runways,  runway lighting, and radio frequencies in use. Each sectional  features a comprehensive legend. A detailed description of  the sectional chart is found in FAA-H-8083- 25, the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.  Figure 11-1  shows  a sample sectional chart.  

The best place to become familiar with sectional charts is  on the ground. It is instructive to fly some “virtual” cross- country flights in various directions from the local soaring  site. In addition to studying the terrain (hills, mountains, large  lakes) that may affect the soaring along the route, study the  various lines and symbols. What airports are available on  course? Do any have a control tower? Can all the numbers  and symbols for each airport be identified? If not, find them  on the legend. Is there Class B, C, or D airspace en route?  Are there any restricted areas? Are there airways along the  flightpath? Once comfortable with the sectional from ground  study, it can be used on some local flights to practice locating  features within a few miles of the soaring site.

Figure 11-1.  Excerpt from a Sectional Aeronautical Chart.  

Any cross-country flight may end with a landing away from  the home soaring site, so pilots and crews should be prepared  for the occurrence prior to flight. Sometimes an aerotow  retrieve can be made if the flight terminates at an airport;  however, trailer retrieval is more typical. Both the trailer and  tow vehicle need a preflight before departing on the flight.  The trailer should be roadworthy and set up for the specific  glider. Stowing and towing a glider in an inappropriate  trailer can lead to damage. The driver should be familiar  with procedures for towing and backing a long trailer. The  tow vehicle should be strong and stable enough for towing.  Both radio and telephone communication options should be  discussed with the retrieval crew.  

Before any flight, obtain a standard briefing and a soaring  forecast from the Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS).  As discussed in Chapter 9, Soaring Weather, the briefer  supplies general weather information for the planned route,  as well as any NOTAMs, AIRMETs, or SIGMETs, winds  aloft, an approaching front, or areas of likely thunderstorm  activity. Depending on the weather outlook, beginners may  find it useful to discuss options with more experienced cross- country pilots at their soaring site.  

Many pilots have specific goals in mind for their next cross- country flight. Several options should be planned ahead based  on the area and different weather scenarios. For instance, if  the goal is a closed-course 300 nautical mile (NM) flight,  several likely out-and-return or triangle courses should be  laid out ahead of time, so that on the specific day, the best  task can be selected based on the weather outlook. There are  numerous final details that need attention on the morning of  the flight, so special items should be organized and readied  the day before the flight.  

Lack of preparation can lead to delays, which may mean not  enough of the soaring day is left to accomplish the planned  flight. Even worse, poor planning leads to hasty last-minute  preparation and a rush to launch, making it easy to miss  critical safety items.  

Inexperienced and experienced pilots alike should use  checklists for various phases of the cross-country preparation  in order to organize details. When properly used, checklists  can help avoid oversights, such as sectionals left at home,  barograph not turned on before takeoff, etc. Checklists also  aid in making certain that safety of flight items, such as all  assembly items, are checked or accomplished, oxygen turned  on, drinking water is in the glider, etc. Examples of checklists  include the following:  

•	 Items to take to the gliderport (food, water, battery,  charts, barograph). •	 Assembly must follow the Glider Flight Manual/ Pilot’s Operating Handbook (GFM/POH) and add  items as needed. •	 Positive control check. •	 Prelaunch (water, food, charts, glide calculator,  oxygen on, sunscreen, cell phone). •	 Pretakeoff checklist itself. •	 Briefing checklist for tow pilot, ground crew, and  retrieval crew.  

Being better organized before the flight leads to less stress  during the flight, enhancing flight safety.  

# Personal and Special Equipment  

Many items not required for local soaring are needed for  cross-country flights. Pilot comfort and physiology is even  more important on cross-country flights since these flights  often last longer than local flights. An adequate supply of  drinking water is essential to avoid dehydration. Many pilots  use the backpack drinking system with readily accessible  hose and bite valve that is often used by bicyclists. This  system is easily stowed beside the pilot, allowing frequent  sips of water. A relief system also may be needed on longer  flights. Cross-country flights can last up to 8 hours or more,  so food of some kind is also a good idea.  

Several items should be carried in case there is an off-field  landing. (For more details, see Chapter 8, Abnormal and  Emergency Procedures.) First, a system for securing the  glider is necessary, as is a land-out kit for the pilot. The  kit varies depending on the population density and climate  of the soaring area. For instance, in the Great Basin in the  United States, a safe landing site may be many miles from the  nearest road or ranch house. Since weather is often hot and  dry during the soaring season, extra water and food should  be added items. Taking good walking shoes is a good idea  as well. A cell phone may prove useful for landouts in areas  with some telephone coverage. Some pilots elect to carry an  Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) in  remote areas in case of mishap during an off-field landing.  

Cross-country soaring requires some means of measuring  distances to calculate glides to the next source of lift or the  next suitable landing area. Distances can be measured using  a sectional chart and navigational plotter with the appropriate  scale, or by use of Global Positioning System (GPS). If GPS  is used, a sectional and plotter should be carried as a backup.  A plotter may be made of clear plastic with a straight edge  on the bottom marked with nautical or statute miles for a  sectional scale on one side and World Aeronautical Chart  (WAC) scale on the other. On the top of the plotter is a  protractor or semicircle with degrees marked for measuring  course angles. A small reference index hole is located in the  center of the semicircle.  [Figure 11-2]  Prior to taking off,  it may be handy to prepare a plotter for the specific glider’s  performance by applying some transparent tape over the  plotter marked with altitudes versus range rings in still air.  After a little use, the glider pilot should gain a perception of  the glide angle most often evident in the conditions of the day.  

Glide calculations must take into account any headwind or  tailwind, as well as speeds to fly through varying sink rates  as discussed in chapter 5. Tools range widely in their level

of sophistication, but all are based on the performance polar  for the particular glider. Most high-performance gliders  usually have glide/navigation computers that automatically  computer the glide ratio (L/D). The simplest glide aid is a  table showing altitudes required for distance versus wind,  which can be derived from the polar. To avoid a table with too  many numbers, which could be confusing, some interpolation  is often needed. Another option is a circular glide calculator  as shown in  Figure 11-3 . This tool allows the pilot to read  the altitude needed for any distance and can be set for various  estimated headwinds and tailwinds. Circular glide calculators  also make it easy to determine whether a pilot is actually  achieving the desired glide, since heavy sink or a stronger- than-estimated headwind can cause a loss of more height with  distance than was indicated by the calculator. For instance,  the settings in  Figure 11-3  indicate that for the estimated 10  knot headwind, 3,600 feet is required to glide 18 miles. After  gliding 5 miles, there is still 2,600 feet. Note that this only  gives the altitude required to make the glide.

Figure 11-3.  Circular glider calculator.  

The pilot can also use simple formulas to mentally compute  an estimated L/D.   One hundred feet per minute (fpm) is  approximately 1 knot. To compute your glide ratio, take  groundspeed divided by vertical speed as indicated on a  vertical speed indicator (VSI) or variometer, then divide by  100 (just drop the zeros). If groundspeed is not available, use  indicated airspeed, which will not yield as accurate a result as  groundspeed. In this case, groundspeed or indicated airspeed is  60 knots. VSI shows 300 fpm down. Calculate the glide ratio.  

$$
{\frac{300\;{\mathrm{fpm}}}{100}}\,=3{\mathrm{~kndownarrows}}
$$  

This is a good approximation of the current L/D.  

Another method is to basically recompute a new L/D by  utilizing this standard formula. Glide ratio, with respect to  the air (GRA) or L/D, remains constant at a given airspeed.  For example, your glider’s glide ratio, lift over drag (L/D)  is 30 to 1 expressed as 30:1 at a speed of 50 knots. At 50  knots with an L/D of 30:1, a 10-knot tailwind results in an  effective L/D of 36:1.  [Figure 11-4]  

In addition to a glide calculator, a MacCready ring on the  variometer allows the pilot to easily read the speed to fly  for different sink rates. MacCready rings are specific to  the type of glider and are based on the glider performance  polar. (See Chapter 4, Flight Instruments, for a description  of the MacCready ring.) Accurately flying the correct speed  in sinking air can extend the achieved glide considerably.  

![](images/5c288a89bd6cf091092c922a53ea9e370bfee7c00f301b91c4b6cd714ece9bd2.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.  Glide calculation example.  

Many models of electronic glide calculators now exist. Often  coupled with an electronic variometer, they display the  altitude necessary for distance and wind as input by the pilot.  In addition, many electronic glide calculators feature speed- to-fly functions that indicate whether the pilot should fly  faster or slower. Most electronic speed-to-fly directors include  audio indications, so the pilot can remain visually focused  outside the cockpit. The pilot should have manual backups  for electronic glide calculators and speed-to-fly directors in  case of a low battery or other electronic system failure.  

Other equipment may be needed to verify soaring performance  to receive a Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) badge  or record flights. These include turn-point cameras, barographs,  and GPS flight recorders. For complete descriptions of these  items, as well as badge or record rules, check the Soaring  Society of America website (www.ssa.org) for details.  

Finally, a notepad or small leg-attached clipboard on which to  make notes before and during the flight is often handy. Notes  prior to flight could include weather information such as winds  aloft forecasts or distance between turn points. In flight, noting  takeoff and start time, as well as time around any turn points,  is useful to gauge average speed around the course.  

# Navigation  

Airplane pilots navigate by pilotage (flying by reference to  ground landmarks) or dead reckoning (computing a heading  from true airspeed and wind, and then estimating time  needed to fly to a destination). Glider pilots use pilotage  since they generally cannot remain on a course line over a  long distance and do not fly one speed for any length of time.  Nonetheless, it is important to be familiar with the concepts  of dead reckoning since a combination of the two methods  is sometimes needed.  

# Using the Plotter  

Measuring distance with the plotter is accomplished by  using the straight edge. Use the Albuquerque sectional  chart and measure the distance between Portales Airport  (Q34) and Benger Airport (Q54), by setting the plotter with  the zero mark on Portales. Read the distance of 47 nautical  miles (NM) to Benger. Make sure to set the plotter with the  sectional scale if using a sectional chart (as opposed to the  WAC scale), otherwise the measurement will be off by a  factor of two.  [Figure 11-5]  

The true heading between Portales and Benger can be  determined by setting the top of the straightedge along the  course line, then slide it along until the index hole is on a line  of longitude intersecting the course line. Read the true heading  on the outer scale, in this case,  $48^{\circ}$  . The outer scale should be  used for headings with an easterly component. If the course  were reversed, flying from Benger to Portales, use the inner  scale, for a westerly component, to find   $228^{\circ}$  .  [Figure 11-6]  

A common error when first using the plotter is to read the  course heading   $180^{\circ}$   in error. This error is easy to make by  reading the scale marked W  $270^{\circ}$   instead of the scale marked E   $09^{\circ}$  . For example, the course from Portales to Benger is towards  the northeast, so the heading should be somewhere between   $30^{\circ}$   and  $60^{\circ}$  , therefore the true heading of   $48^{\circ}$   is reasonable.  

# A Sample Cross-Country Flight  

For training purposes, plan a triangle course starting at  Portales Airport (PRZ), with turn points at Benger Airport  (X54), and the town of Circle Back. As part of the preflight  preparation, draw the course lines for the three legs. Using  the plotter, determine the true heading for each leg, then  correct for variation and make a written note of the magnetic  heading on each leg. Use  $9^{\circ}$   east (E) variation as indicated  on the sectional chart (subtract easterly variations, and add  westerly variations). The first leg distance is  $47~\mathrm{{NM}}$   with a  heading of  $48^{\circ}\,(48^{\circ}\,{-}\,9^{\circ}\,\mathrm{E}\,{=}\,39^{\circ}$   magnetic); the second leg is   $38\,\mathrm{NM}$   at   $178^{\circ}$   true   $(178^{\circ}-9^{\circ}\,\mathrm{E}=169^{\circ}$   magnetic); the third  leg is  $38~\mathrm{{NM}}$   at   $282^{\circ}$   true   $(282^{\circ}-9^{\circ}\,\mathrm{E}=273^{\circ}$   magnetic).  [Figure 11-7]  

Assume the base of the cumulus is forecast to be  $11{,}000\,\mathrm{MSL}$  ,  and the winds aloft indicate  $320^{\circ}$   at 10 knots at   $9{,}000\:\mathrm{MSL}$  and  $330^{\circ}$   at 20 knots at   $12{,}000\,\mathrm{MSL}$  . Make a written note of  the winds aloft for reference during the flight. For instance,  the first leg has almost a direct crosswind from the left; on the  second leg, a weaker crosswind component from the right;  while the final leg is almost directly into the wind. Knowing  courses and approximate headings aids the navigation and  helps avoid getting lost, even though deviations to stay with  the best lift are needed. During the flight, if the sky ahead

Figure 11-7.  Cross-country triangle.  

shows several equally promising cumulus clouds, choosing  the one closest to the course line makes the most sense.  

During preflight preparation, study the course line along  each leg for expected landmarks. For instance, the first leg  follows highway and parallel railroad tracks for several miles  before the highway turns north. The town of Clovis should  become obvious on the left. Note the Class D airspace around  Cannon Air Force Base (CVS) just west of Clovis—this could  be an issue if there is better soaring north of course track  because of military traffic operating into Cannon. With the  northwesterly wind, it is possible to be crossing the path of  aircraft on a long final approach to the northwest-southeast  runway at the air base.  

Next is the Clovis airport (CVN) with traffic to check  operating in and out of the airport. Following Clovis are  Bovina and Friona; these towns can serve as landmarks for  the flight. The proximity of the Texico (TXO) VOR, a VHF  Omnidirectional Range station near Bovina, indicates the  need for alertness for power traffic in the vicinity. The VOR  serves as an approach aid to the Clovis airport.  

The first turn point is easy to locate because of good landmarks,  including Benger Airport (X54).  [Figure 11-8]  The second  leg has fewer landmarks. After about 25 miles, the town of  Muleshoe and the Muleshoe airport (2T1) should appear.  The town should be on the right and the airport on the left  of the intended course. Next, the course enters the Bronco  1 Military Operations Area (MOA). The dimensions of the

Figure 11-8.  Benger Airport (X54).  

MOA can be found on the sectional chart, and the automated  flight service station (AFSS) should be consulted concerning  the active times of this airspace. Approaching the second  turn point, it is easy to confuse the towns of Circle Back  and Needmore.  [Figure 11-9]  The clues are the position of  Circle Back relative to an obstruction 466 feet above ground  level (AGL) and a road that heads north out of Needmore.  Landmarks on the third leg include power transmission lines,  Salt Lake (possibly dry), the small town of Arch, and a major  road coming south out of Portales. About eight miles from  Portales a VOR V-280 airway is crossed.  

![](images/4b0219d4570a4e1aa278d01c3792a95435a7de99156f4cdda2b49169acab4282.jpg)  
Figure 11-9.  Circle Back and Needmore.  

After a thorough preflight of the glider and all the appropriate  equipment is stowed or in position for use in flight, it is time  to go fly. Once in the air and on course, try to verify the  winds aloft. Use pilotage to remain as close to the course line  as soaring conditions permit. If course deviations become  necessary, stay aware of the location of the course line to the  next turn point. For instance, the  $\mathrm{Cu}$   directly ahead indicates  lift, but the one  $30^{\circ}$   off course indicates possibly even more lift,  it may be better not to deviate. If the Cu left of course indicates  a possible area of lift compared to the clouds ahead and only  requires a   $10^{\circ}$   off course deviation, proceed towards the lift.  Knowing the present location of the glider and where the course  line is located is important for keeping situational awareness.  

Sometimes it is necessary to determine an approximate course  once already in the air. Assume a few miles before reaching  the town of Muleshoe, on the second leg, the weather ahead is  not as forecast and has deteriorated—there is now a shower at  the third turn point (Circle Back). Rather than continuing on  to a certain landing in the rain, the decision is made to cut the  triangle short and try to return directly to Portales. Measure  and find that Portales is about 37 miles away, and the estimated  heading is about  $240^{\circ}$  . Correct for variation  $(9^{\circ})$   for a compass  heading of about  $231^{\circ}$   (  $240^{\circ}-9^{\circ}=231^{\circ})$  ). The northwesterly  wind is almost   $90^{\circ}$   to the new course and requires a   $10^{\circ}$   or   $20^{\circ}$   crab to the right, so a heading between   $250^{\circ}$   and   $270^{\circ}$    should work, allowing for some drift in thermal climbs. With  practice, the entire thought process should take little time.  

The sky towards Portales indicates favorable lift conditions.  However, the area along the new course includes sand hills,  an area that may not have good choices for off-field landings.  It may be a good idea to fly more conservatively until beyond  this area and then back to where there are suitable fields for  landing. Navigation, evaluation of conditions ahead, and  decision-making are required until arrival back at Portales  or until a safe off-field landing is completed.  

# Navigation Using GPS  

The GPS navigation systems are available as small hand-held  units. (See Chapter 4, Flight Instruments, for information on  GPS and electronic flight computers.) Some pilots prefer to  use existing flight computers for final glide and speed-to- fly information and add a hand-held GPS for navigation. A  GPS system makes navigation easier. A GPS unit displays  distance and heading to a specified point, usually found by  scrolling through an internal database of waypoints. Many  GPS units also continuously calculate and display ground  speed. If TAS is also known, the headwind component can  be calculated from the GPS by subtracting ground speed from  TAS. Many GPS units also feature a moving map display  that shows past and present positions in relation to various  prominent landmarks like airports. These displays can often  zoom in and out to various map scales. Other GPS units  allow marking a spot for future reference. This feature can  be used to mark the location of a thermal before going into  a turn point, with the hopes that the area will still be active  after rounding the turn point.  

One drawback to GPS units is their attractiveness—it is easy  to be distracted by the unit at the expense of flying the glider  and finding lift. This can lead to a dangerous habit of focusing  too much time inside the cockpit rather than scanning outside  for traffic. Like any electronic instrument, GPS units can fail,  so it is important to have a backup for navigation, such as a  sectional and plotter.  

# Cross-Country Techniques  

The number one rule of safe cross-country soaring is always  stay within glide range of a suitable landing area. The  alternate landing area may be an airport or a farmer’s field.  If thermaling is required just to make it to a suitable landing  area, safe cross-country procedures are not being practiced.  Sailplane pilots should always plan for high sink rates  between thermals as there are always areas of sink around  a lifting thermal to fill in the void vacated by the lifting air.  

Before venturing beyond gliding distance from the home  airport, thermaling and cross-country techniques can be  practiced using small triangles or other short courses. Three  examples are shown in  Figure 11-10 . The length of each  leg depends on the performance of the glider, but they are  typically small, around 5 or 10 miles each. Soaring conditions  do not need to be excellent for these practice tasks but should  not be so weak that it is difficult just to stay aloft. On a good  day, the triangle may be flown more than once. If other  airports are nearby, practice finding and switching to their  

![](images/123480a2c8a8c5524078a757caff78cea6484e1f5ac6cfba44024bf039cd6337.jpg)  
Figure 11-10.  Examples of practice cross-country courses.  

communication frequency and listening to traffic in the traffic  pattern. As progress is made along each leg of the triangle,  frequently cross check the altitude needed to return to the  home airport and abandon the course if needed. Setting a  minimum altitude of 1,500 feet or 2,000 feet AGL to arrive  back at the home site adds a margin of safety. Every landing  after a soaring flight should be an accuracy landing.  

Determining winds aloft while en route can be difficult. Often  an estimate is the best that can be achieved. A first estimate  is obtained from winds aloft forecasts provided by the AFSS.  Once aloft, estimate windspeed and direction from the track  of cumulus shadows over the ground, keeping in mind that  the winds at cloud level are often different than those at  lower levels. On cloudless days, obtain an estimate of wind  by noting drift while thermaling. If the estimate was for a  headwind of 10 knots but more height is lost on glides than  the glide calculator indicates, the headwind estimate may be  too low and will need to be adjusted. When flying with GPS,  determine windspeed from TAS by simple subtraction. Some  flight computers automatically calculate the winds aloft while  other GPS systems estimate winds by calculating the drift  after several thermal turns.  

It is important to develop skill in quickly determining  altitude needed for a measured distance using one of the  glide calculator tools. For instance, while on a cross-country  flight and over a good landing spot with the next good  landing site a distance of 12 miles into a 10-knot headwind.  [Figure 11-11]  The glide calculator shows that 3,200 feet is  needed to accomplish the glide. Add 1,500 feet above ground  to allow time to set up for an off-field landing if necessary,  to make the total needed 4,700 feet. The present height is  only 3,800 feet, not high enough to accomplish the 12-mile  glide, but still high enough to start along course. Head out  adjusting the speed based on the MacCready ring or other  speed director. After two miles with no lift, altitude is almost  3,300 feet, still not high enough to glide the remaining 10  miles, but high enough to turn back to the last landing site.  After almost 4 miles, a 4-knot thermal is encountered at about  2,700 feet and provides for a climb to 4,300 feet.  

When using the glide calculator tool, keep in mind that these  calculations account for only the glider’s calm air rate of  descent. Any sink can drastically affect these calculations  and make them worthless. In times of good lift, there will  also be areas of strong sink. A sailplane pilot must learn to  read the sky to find the lift and avoid or pass through the sink  as quickly as possible. Time in lift is good and time in sink  is bad. A good sailplane pilot will be thoroughly aware of  that particular sailplane’s polar curves and the effects from  different conditions of lift, sink, and winds.  

![](images/0dc87373421591d1394240e52504574d95bed03d6e9c8b2eb45a74b71676cd53.jpg)  
Figure 11-11.  Example of a flight profile during a cross-country course.  

During the climb, the downwind drift of the thermal moves  the glider back on course approximately a half mile. Now,  there is almost 9 miles to glide to the next landing spot, and  a check of the glide calculator indicates 2,400 feet are needed  for the glide into the 10-knot headwind, plus 1,500 feet at the  destination, for a total of 3,900 feet. Now, there is 400 feet  above the minimum glide with a margin to plan the landing. In the previous example, had the thermal topped at 3,600 feet  (instead of 4,300 feet) there would not be enough altitude to  glide the 9 miles into the 10-knot headwind. However, there  would be enough height to continue further on course in  hopes of finding more lift before needing to turn downwind  back to the previous landing spot. Any cross-country soaring  flight involves dozens of decisions and calculations such  as this. In addition, safety margins may need to be more  conservative if there is reason to believe the glide may not  work as planned, for example, other pilots reporting heavy  sink along the intended course.  

On any soaring flight, there is an altitude when a decision  must be made to cease attempts to work thermals and  commit to a landing. This is especially true of cross-country  flights in which landings are often in unfamiliar places and  feature additional pressures like those discussed in Chapter  8, Abnormal and Emergency Procedures. It is even more  difficult on cross-country flights to switch the mental process  from soaring to committing to a landing. For beginners, an  altitude of 1,000 feet AGL is a recommended minimum to  commit to landing. A better choice is to pick a landing site  by 1,500 feet AGL, which still allows time to be ready for a  thermal while further inspecting the intended landing area.  The exact altitude where the thought processes should shift  from soaring to landing preparation depends on the terrain.  In areas of the Midwest in the United States, landable fields  may be present every few miles, allowing a delay in field  selection to a lower altitude. In areas of the desert southwest  or the Great Basin, landing sites may be 30 or more miles  apart, so focusing on a landing spot must begin at much  higher altitudes above the ground.  

Once committed in the pattern, do not try to thermal away  again. Accidents occur due to stalls or spins from thermaling  attempts in the pattern. Damage to the glider’s airframe can  and has occurred after a pilot drifted away from a safe landing  spot while trying to thermal from low altitudes. When the  thermal dissipates, the pilot is too far beyond the site to return  for a safe landing and is left with a less suitable landing choice.  It is easy to fall into this trap. In the excitement of preparing  for an off-field landing, do not forget a prelanding checklist.  

A common first cross-country flight is a 50-kilometer (32  statute miles) straight distance flight with a landing at another  field. The distance is short enough that it can be flown at a  leisurely pace on an average soaring day and also qualifies  for part of the FAI Silver Badge. Prepare the course well and  find out about all available landing areas along the way. Get  to the soaring site early so there is no rush in the preflight  preparations. Once airborne, take time to get a feel for the  day’s thermals. If the day looks good enough and height is  adequate to set off on course, commit to the task! Landing  away from the home field for the first time requires skill,  planning, and knowledge but is a confidence builder whether  the task was accomplished or not.  

# Soaring Faster and Farther  

Early cross-country flights, including small practice triangles  within gliding range of the home field, are excellent  preparation and training for longer cross-country flights.  The FAI Gold Badge requires a 300-kilometer (187 statute  miles) cross-country flight, which can be straight out distance  or a declared triangle or out-and-return flight. An average  cross-country speed of 20 or 30 miles per hour (mph) may  have been adequate for a 32-mile flight, but that average  speed is too low on most days for longer flights. Flying at  higher average cross-country speeds also allows for farther  soaring flights.  

Improvement of cross-country skills comes primarily from  practice, but reviewing theory as experience is gained is  also important. A theory or technique that initially made  little sense to the beginner has real meaning and significance  after several cross-country flights. Postflight self-critique is  a useful tool to improve skills.  

In the context of cross-country soaring, flying faster means  achieving a faster average groundspeed. The secret to faster  cross-country flight lies in spending less time climbing and  more time gliding. This is achieved by using only the better  thermals and spending more time in lifting air and less time  in sinking air. Optimum speeds between thermals are given  by MacCready ring theory and/or speed-to-fly theory, and can  be determined through proper use of the MacCready speed  ring or equivalent electronic speed director.  

# Height Bands  

On most soaring days there is an altitude range, called a  height band, in which the thermal strength is at a maximum.  Height bands can be defined as the optimum altitude range  in which to climb and glide on a given day. For instance, a  thermal in the 3,000 feet AGL range may have 200 to  $300\,\mathrm{fpm}$  thermals, increasing to  $500\,\mathrm{fpm}$   at 5,000 feet AGL range then  weaken before topping out at 6,000 feet AGL. In this case,  the height band would be 2,000 feet deep between 3,000 feet  and 5,000 feet AGL. Staying within the height band gives  the best (fastest) climbs. Avoid stopping for weaker thermals  while within the height band unless there is a good reason.  

On another day, thermals may be strong from 1,000 feet to  6,000 feet AGL before weakening, which would suggest a  height band 5,000 feet deep. In this case, however, depending  on thermal spacing, terrain, pilot experience level, and other  factors, the height band would be 2,000 feet or 3,000 feet up  to 6,000 feet AGL. Avoid continuing to the lower bounds  of strong thermals (1,000 feet AGL) since failure to find a  thermal there gives no extra time before committing to a  landing.  [Figure 11-12]  

![](images/56e211e6a46752fe37459024205e6e7d6127f1e6b91f10326fb4fde8c5aeae88.jpg)  
Figure 11-12.  Example of the height band.  

NOTE: Automated Flight Service Stations (AFSS) report  cloud levels as AGL in METARS, and PIREPS are reported  as MSL. Area forecasts gives clouds as MSL if above   $1{,}000^{\prime}$  AGL. Pilots must be careful to determine which value is being  presented. This is very important when glider pilots travel  to higher elevation airports and must subtract field elevation  from MSL reports to ensure cloud clearances.  

Determining the top of the height band is a matter of personal  preference and experience, but a rule of thumb puts the top at  an altitude where thermals drop off to 75 percent of the best  achieved climb. If maximum thermal strength in the height  band is  $400\,\mathrm{fpm}$  , leave when thermals decrease to 300 fpm  for more than a turn or two. The thermal strength used to  determine the height band should be an average achieved  climb. Many electronic variometers have an average function  that displays average climb over specific time intervals.  

Another technique involves simply timing the altitude gained  over 30 seconds or 1 minute.  

Theoretically, the optimum average speed is attained if the  MacCready ring is set for the achieved rate of climb within  the height band. To do this, rotate the ring so that the index  mark is at the achieved rate of climb (for instance,  $400\,\mathrm{fpm})$  )  rather than at zero (the setting used for maximum distance).  A series of climbs and glides gives the optimum balance  between spending time climbing and gliding. The logic is  that, on stronger days, the extra altitude lost by flying faster  between thermals is more than made up in the strong lift  during climbs. Flying slower than the MacCready setting  does not make the best use of available climbs. Flying faster  than the MacCready setting uses too much altitude between  thermals; it then takes more than the optimum amount of  time to regain the altitude.  

Strict use of the MacCready ring assumes that the next  thermal is at least as strong as that set on the ring and can be  reached with the available altitude. Efforts to fly faster must  be tempered with judgment when conditions are not ideal.  Factors that may require departure from the MacCready ring  theory include terrain (extra height needed ahead to clear a  ridge), distance to the next landable spot, or deteriorating  soaring conditions ahead. If the next thermal appears to be  out of reach before dropping below the height band, either  climb higher, glide more slowly, or both.  

To illustrate the use of speed-to-fly theory, assume there are  four gliders at the same height. Ahead are three weak cumulus  clouds, each produced by 200-fpm thermals, then a larger  cumulus with 600 fpm thermals under it, as in  Figure 11-13.  

•	 Pilot 1 sets the ring to 6 knots for the anticipated strong  climb under the large cumulus, but the aggressive  approach has the glider on the ground before reaching  the cloud. •	 Pilot 2 sets the ring for 2 knots and climbs under each  cloud until resetting the ring to 6 knots after climbing  under the third weak cumulus, in accordance with  strict speed-to-fly theory. •	 Pilot 3 is conservative and sets the ring to zero for the  maximum glide. •	 Pilot 4 calculates the altitude needed to glide to the  large cumulus using an intermediate setting of 3 knots,  and finds the glider can glide to the cloud and still be  within the height band.  

By the time pilot 4 has climbed under the large cumulus,  the pilot is well ahead of the other two pilots and is relaying  retrieve instructions for pilot 1. This example illustrates  the science and art of faster cross-country soaring. The  science is provided by speed-to-fly theory, while the art  involves interpreting and modifying the theory for the actual  conditions. Knowledge of speed-to-fly theory is important as  a foundation. How to apply the art of cross-country soaring  stems from practice and experience.  

# Tips and Techniques  

The height band changes during the day. On a typical soaring  day, thermal height and strength often increases rapidly  

![](images/5247ac7eae65f0c431713eefcb710a0ec32eb952d566398e76b214cf74a55eac.jpg)

during late morning, and then both remain somewhat steady  for several hours during the afternoon. The height band rises  and broadens with thermal height. Sometimes the top of the  height band is limited by the base of cumulus clouds. Cloud  base may slowly increase by thousands of feet over several  hours, during which the height band also increases. Thermals  often “shut off” rapidly late in the day, so a good rule of thumb  is to stay higher late in the day.  [Figure 11-14]  

It is a good idea to stop and thermal when at or near the  bottom of the height band. Pushing too hard can lead to an  early off-field landing. Pushing too hard leads to loss of time  at lower altitudes because the pilot is trying to climb in weak  lift conditions.  

Another way to increase cross-country speed is to avoid  turning at all. A technique known as dolphin flight can be used  to cover surprising distances on thermal days with little or no  circling. The idea is to speed up in sink and slow down in lift  while only stopping to circle in the best thermals. The speed to  fly between lift areas is based on the appropriate MacCready  setting. This technique is effective when thermals are spaced  relatively close together, as occurs along a cloud street.  

As an example, assume two gliders are starting at the same  point and flying under a cloud street with frequent thermals  and only weak sink between thermals. Glider 1 uses the  conditions more efficiently by flying faster in the sink and  slower in lift. In a short time, glider 1 has gained distance  on glider 2.  Glider 2 conserves altitude and stays close to  cloud base by flying best L/D through weak sink. To stay  under the clouds, he is forced to fly faster in areas of lift,  exactly opposite of flying fast in sink, slow in lift. At the  end of the cloud street, one good climb quickly puts glider 1  near cloud base and well ahead of glider 2.  [Figure 11-15] The best speed to fly decreases time in sink and therefore  

![](images/935c191eb692b039474e33f369e03818efeba38bc8eb772a495bb5d3c41cd5a3.jpg)

decreases the overall amount of descent but produces the  best forward progress. Being slower in sink increases time  descending and slows forward progress, while being fast in  lift decreases time in lift and altitude gained.

Figure 11-15.  Advantage of proper speed to fly under a cloud street.  

On an actual cross-country flight, a combination of dolphin  flight and classic climb and glide is frequently needed. In a  previous example, the two pilots who decided not to stop  and circle in the weaker thermals would still benefit from  dolphin flight techniques in the lift and sink until stopping  to climb in the strong lift.  

# Special Situations  

# Course Deviations  

Diversion on a soaring cross-country flight is the norm rather  than the exception. Some soaring days supply fair weather  cumulus evenly spaced across all quadrants, and it is still  beneficial to deviate toward stronger lift. Deviations of   $10^{\circ}$  or less add little to the total distance and should be used  without hesitation to fly toward better lift. Even deviations  up to  $30^{\circ}$   are well worthwhile if they lead toward better lift  and/or avoid suspected sink ahead. The sooner the deviation is  started, the less total distance is covered during the deviation.  [Figure 11-16]  

Deviations of  $45^{\circ}$   or even   $90°$   may be needed to avoid poor  conditions ahead. An example might be a large cloudless area  or a shaded area where cumulus have spread out into stratus  clouds. Sometimes deviations in excess of   $90^{\circ}$   are needed  to return to active thermals after venturing into potentially  stable air.  

Deviations due to poor weather ahead should be undertaken  before the flight becomes unsafe. For instance, if cloud bases  are lowering and showers developing, always have the option  for a safe, clear landing area before conditions deteriorate  too much. Generally, glider pilots will encounter stable air  or sinking air which will put them on the ground before VFR  conditions disappear. If the sky becomes cloudy, thermaling  will cease. Ridge lift might remain but will be in the clouds  so either way the glider pilot must get on the ground. It is  better to land on your terms rather than be forced down by  total lack of lift. Thunderstorms along the course are a special  hazard, since storm outflow can affect surface winds for many  miles surrounding the storm. Do not count on landing at a  site within 10 miles of a strong thunderstorm—sites farther  removed are safer. Thunderstorms ahead often warrant large  course deviations of up to   $180^{\circ}$   (i.e., retreat to safety).  

NOTE: Cloud development can and does shade the earth,  decreasing the heating, and hence decreasing lift.  Be aware  of cloud shadowing.  

# Lost Procedures  

Navigation has become far easier with the advent of GPS.  Since GPS systems are not 100 percent free from failure,  pilots must still be able use the sectional chart and compass  for navigation. It is important to have an alternate plan in  the event of becoming lost. As discussed earlier, preflight  

![](images/95c672ae4562e622cc7586892163e8430099e3827f1e610c30b207eaac4da917.jpg)  
Figure 11-16.  Effects of starting course deviations at different times. Red arrows show extra course distance and indicate the benefit of  early course deviations.  

preparation can help avoid becoming lost. Spend some time  studying the sectional chart for airports or other notable  landmarks along the route.  

If you are still lost after some initial searching, try to remain  calm. The first priority is to make sure there is a suitable  landing area within gliding distance. Then, if possible, try to  find lift, even if it is weak, and climb. This buys time and gives  a wider view of the area. Next, try to estimate the last known  position, the course flown, and any possible differences in  wind at altitude. For instance, maybe the headwind is stronger  than anticipated and not as far along the course as expected.  Try to pinpoint the present position from an estimate of the  distance traveled for a given period of time and confirm it  with visible landmarks by reference to the sectional chart.  For instance, if at point X, averaging about 50 knots, heading  north for about 30 minutes should put the glider at point Y.  Look again at the sectional chart for landmarks that should be  nearby point Y, then search the ground for these landmarks.  Thermaling while searching has the added advantage of  allowing a wider area of scan while circling.  

Once a landmark is located on the sectional and on the  ground, confirm the location by finding a few other nearby  landmarks. For instance, if that is a town below, then the  highway should curve like the one shown on the chart. Does  it? If you are lost and near a suitable landing area, stay in the  area until certain of location. Airports and airport runways  provide valuable clues, like runway orientation and markings  or the location of town or a city relative to the airport.  

If all efforts fail, attempt a radio call to other soaring pilots  in the area. A description of what is below and nearby may  bring help from a fellow pilot more familiar with the area.  

# Cross-Country Flight in a Self-Launching  Glider  

A self-launching glider can give the pilot much more freedom  in exchange for a more complex and expensive aircraft. First,  a self-launching glider allows the pilot to fly from airports  without a towplane or tow pilot. Second, the engine can be  used to avoid off-field landings and extend the flight. In  theory, when low in a self-launching glider, simply start  the engine and climb to the next source of lift. This second  advantage has pitfalls and dangers of its own and has led to  many accidents due to engine failure and/or improper starting  procedures. Engines on self-launching gliders generally are  less reliable than those on airplanes and are susceptible to  special problems. For instance, in the western United States,  summer thermals often extend to altitudes where the air is  cold. The self-launching engine can become cold soaked  after several hours of flight, and may take more time to start  or may fail to start.  

Overreliance on the engine may result in a false sense of  security. This can lead pilots to glide over unlandable terrain,  something they might not normally do. If the engine then  fails when needed most, the pilot has no safe place to land.  Some accidents have occurred in which the engine starting  system was actually fully functional, but in the rush to start  the engine to avoid landing, the pilot did not perform a critical  task, such as switching the ignition on. Other accidents have  occurred in which the engine did not start immediately, and  while trying to solve the starting problem, the pilot flew too  far from a suitable landing area. For a self-launching glider  with an engine that stows in the fuselage behind the cockpit,  the added drag of an extended engine can reduce the glide  ratio by 50 to 75 percent.  [Figure 11-17]  

![](images/e55a25bd9351224499bedbc6c08781fbc0c94900f0e9a460e12b6e834c97a151.jpg)  
Figure 11-17.  Effects on the glide ratio of the engine being extended but not running.  

The critical decision height to commit to an engine start on  a self-launching glider is typically higher than the critical  decision height for a nonpowered glider. This is due to a  combination of the time needed to start the engine and extra  drag during the starting process. It may take anywhere from  200 feet to 500 feet of altitude to extend and then start the  engine. Whereas a pure glider may commit to landing at  1,000 feet AGL, the pilot of a self-launching glider probably  opts for 1,500 feet AGL, depending on the glider and landing  options should the engine fail. In this sense, the self-launching  glider becomes more restrictive.  

Cross-country flight can also be done under power with a self- launching glider, or a combination of powered and soaring  flight. For some self-launching gliders, the most efficient  distance per gallon of fuel is achieved by a maximum climb  under power followed by a power-off glide. Check the GFM/ POH for recommendations.  

Another type of glider features a sustainer engine. These  engines are not powerful enough to self-launch but are  able to keep the glider airborne if lift fails. Sustainers can  only produce enough power to overcome the glider’s sink  rate, and the higher sink rates can easily overwhelm the  climb rate capability of many sustainer powerplants. The  sustainer engine is typically less complex to operate than  their self-launching counterparts, and can eliminate the need  for a time-consuming retrieval. Pilots flying with a sustainer  are susceptible to the same pitfalls as their self-launching  counterparts.  

# High-Performance Glider Operations and  Considerations  

Extended cross-country flights have been made in relatively  low-performance gliders. However, on any given soaring day,  a glider with a 40:1 glide ratio is able to fly farther and faster  than one with 20:1, assuming the pilots in both have similar  skill levels. Often, a glider pilot looks for more performance  in a glider to achieve longer and faster cross-country flights.  

# Glider Complexity  

Most high-performance gliders have a single seat. If a two- seat, high-performance glider is available, the pilot should  obtain some instruction from an authorized flight instructor  before attempting to fly a single seat high-performance glider  for the first time. Before flying any single-seat glider, pilots  should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the GFM/ POH, including important speeds, weight and balance issues,  and all operating systems in the glider GFM/POH, such as  landing gear, flaps, and wheel brake location.  

High-performance gliders are usually more complex and  somewhat more difficult to fly, but they vary considerably.  

Current Standard Class gliders (15 meter wingspan  and no flaps) are easy to assemble, and newer types  are comparatively easier to fly. On the other end of the  spectrum, Open Class gliders (unlimited wingspan with  flaps) can feature wingspans of 24 meters or more with  wings in four sections. The experience required to fly a  high-performance glider cannot be quantified simply in  terms of a pilot’s total glider hours. Types of gliders flown  (low and high performance) must be considered.  

Almost all high-performance gliders have retractable landing  gear, so pilots must make certain that “landing gear down” is  on their prelanding checklist. Most landing gear handles are  on the right side of the cockpit, but a few are on the left side,  so caution is required when reaching for a handle to make  sure it is not flaps or airbrakes. A common error is to neglect  to retract the landing gear and then mistakenly retract it as  part of the prelanding checklist. A gear-up landing in a glider  usually causes only embarrassment and minor damage. The  distance between the pilot and the runway with the landing  gear up is minimal, providing no real “cushioning” protection  for the pilot during a hard landing.  

Many high-performance gliders have flaps. A few degrees  of positive flap can be used when thermaling, and some  gliders have   $30^{\circ}$   or more positive flap settings for lower  landing speeds. Flaps can be set to  $0^{\circ}$   for relatively low-speed  glides, while negative flap settings are available for glides  at higher speeds. The GFM/POH and glider polar provide  recommended flap settings for different speeds, as well as  maximum speeds allowed for different flap settings. A few  high-performance gliders have no air brakes and use only  large positive flap settings for landing. This system allows  steep approaches but can be uncomfortable for a pilot who  has only used spoilers or dive brakes for landing. A thorough  ground briefing is required.  

Many high-performance gliders have greater wingspans  that require special care to avoid ground loops on takeoff  or landing. Runway lights and other obstructions near the  runway can become a problem. If a wingtip strikes the  ground before the glider has touched down, a cartwheel is a  possibility, leading to extensive damage and serious injury.  Gliders with long wings often have speed restrictions for  dive brake use to avoid severe bending loads at the wingtips.  

The feel of the controls on high-performance gliders is light,  and pilot-induced oscillations (PIOs) occur easily with the  sensitive elevator. Elevator movements using the wrist only,  while the forearm rests on the thigh, can aid in avoiding PIOs.  

Some high-performance gliders have only one center of  gravity (CG) towhook either ahead of the landing gear or in  the landing gear well. If the CG hook is within the landing  gear well, retracting the gear on tow interferes with the  towline. Even if the glider has a nose hook, retracting the  gear on tow is not recommended, since the handle is usually  on the right cockpit side and switching hands to raise the gear  can lead to loss of control on tow. A CG hook, as compared  to a nose hook, makes a crosswind takeoff more difficult  since the glider can weathervane into the wind more easily.  In addition, a CG hook makes the glider more susceptible  to “kiting” on takeoff, especially if the flying CG is near the  aft limit. This can present a serious danger to the tow pilot.  

# Water Ballast  

To maximize average cross-country speed on a day with  strong thermals, water ballast can be used. The gain in speed  between thermals outweighs the lost time due to slightly  slower climbs with water ballast. If thermals are weak,  ballast should not be used. If strong thermals become weak,  the water ballast can be dumped. In any case, water ballast  should be dumped before landing because heavy wings are  more difficult to keep level on the ground roll, and a hard  landing is more likely to lead to damage with a heavier  glider. Water dumping times vary but are typically between  2 and 5 minutes.  

Water ballast is carried in the wings in built-in tanks or water  bags. The latter works well but has been known to have  problems with leaks. Filling and dumping systems vary from  glider to glider, and it is vital to be familiar with the ballast  system as described in the GFM/POH. Filling without proper  venting can lead to structural damage. Care must be taken  to ensure that both wings are filled with the same amount of  water. If one wing has a few extra gallons, it can be lead to  ground loops and loss of control on takeoff, especially in the  presence of a crosswind.  

Water expands when going from the liquid state to the solid  state. The force of the water ballast freezing can be enough  to split composite wing skins. If anticipating flying at levels  where the temperature might be below  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , follow the GFM/ POH recommended additive to avoid freezing.  

Some gliders have a small ballast tank in the tail, as well  as ballast in the wings. Tail ballast is an effective means to  adjust for a CG that is too far forward. It should be used with  caution, however, since the position of the tail ballast tank  gives it a long arm aft of the empty CG. A careless calculation  can lead to too much water in the tail tank and a flying CG  that is aft of the limit.  

# Cross-Country Flight Using Other Lift  Sources  

Many world distance and speed records have been broken  using ridge or wave lift. Under the right conditions, these  lift sources can extend for hundreds of miles from sunrise  to sunset. Ridge or wave lift is often more consistent than  thermals, allowing long, straight stretches at high speed.  

Cross-country flight on ridge lift poses some special problems  and considerations. Often, the best lift is very close to the  ridge crest where the air can be quite turbulent. Great pilot  concentration is needed over several hours close to terrain  in rough conditions for longer flights. On relatively low  ridges, (e.g., in the eastern United States) ridge lift may not  extend very high, so the pilot is never too far from a potential  off-field landing. These are not conditions for the beginning  cross-country pilot. In milder conditions, gaps in the ridge  may require thermaling to gain enough height to cross the  gap. Ridge lift can provide a place to temporarily wait for  thermals to generate. For instance, if cumulus have spread  out to form a stratus layer shading the ground and eliminating  thermals, a wind facing slope can be used to maintain soaring  flight until the sun returns to regenerate thermals.  

Wave lift can also provide opportunities for long and/or fast  cross-country flights. Most record flights have been along  mountain ranges; flights in excess of 2,000 kilometers having  been flown in New Zealand and along the Andes. In the United  States, speed records have been set using the wave in the lee  of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In theory, long-distance  flights could also be made by climbing high in wave, then  gliding with a strong tailwind to the next range downwind  for another climb. Special consideration for pilot physiology  (cold, oxygen, etc.) and airspace restrictions are needed when  considering a cross-country flight using wave lift.  

Convergence zones can also be used to enhance cross-country  speed. Even if the convergence is not a consistent line but  merely acts as a focus for thermals, dolphin flight is often  possible, making glides over long distances possible without  thermaling. When flying low, awareness of local, small-scale  convergence can help the pilot find thermal triggers, enabling  climb back to a comfortable cruising height.  

It is possible to find ridge, thermal, wave, and even  convergence lift during one cross-country flight. Optimum  use of the various lift sources requires mental agility but  makes for an exciting and rewarding flight.  

# Introduction  

Tow planes are the most common way that a glider obtains  altitude.  [Figure 12-1]  Winch or automobile tows are being  used less and less as they require more crew, are more difficult  to set up, and the altitude gain for the glider is just a fraction  of what a tow plane can offer. Pilots of gliders and powered  aircraft must abide by all federal air regulations listed in the  appropriate Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) governing  flight. The CFRs that are applicable to pilot certification for  towing gliders is covered by Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 61, Certification: Pilots, Flight  Instructors, and Ground Instructors,”and 14 CFR Part 91,  General Operating and Flight Rules. The following sections  are also applicable:

# Equipment Inspections and Operational  Checks  

# Tow Hook  

There are typically two types of tow hooks used in the United  States: Tost or Schweizer. The tow hook must be inspected  for proper operation daily and prior to any tow activity.  [Figure 12-4]  

# Schweizer Tow Hook  

Prior to use, the tow hook and release arm should be inspected  for damage, cracks, deformation, and freedom of movement  on the pivot bolt. Visually check the tow hook and ensure  that the hook properly engages the release arm. Inspect the  rubber spacer for general condition and check the condition  of the release cable. Inside the cockpit, check to see that the  manual release lever is not rubbing against the aircraft seat or  any other obstructions, and check the security of the release  handle assembly and the cable attachment.  

The following operation checks should be performed to the  tow hook:  

•	 Attach the tow line to the tow hook and apply tension  on the line in the direction of tow. •	 With tension on the tow line, have another person pull  the release control in the tow plane cockpit and check  for proper release of the tow line. •	 If the tow line does not properly release, restrict the tow  plane from towing duties until repairs can be made. •	 Reattach the tow line and apply a moderate tug in the  direction of tow. •	 Inspect the release assembly to ensure it has remained  completely closed. •	 If the release assembly has opened, even partially,  restrict the tow plane from towing duties and repair  the tow assembly.  

# Tost Tow Hook  

Before use, ensure that the release hook opens completely  when the cockpit release is pulled to its fullest extent.  The release hooks should touch the tow hook ring. If the  release mechanism is not working correctly, it should not  be repaired by anyone other than the Tost Factory. Inside  the cockpit, check to see that the manual release lever is not  rubbing against the aircraft seat or any other obstructions,  and check the security of the release handle assembly and  the cable attachment. When the cockpit manual release lever  is released, the tow hook should return to the fully closed  position. Before each use, check the tow hook and ensure that

The following operation checks should be performed to the  tow hook:  

•	 Attach the tow line to the tow hook and apply tension  on the line in the direction of tow.  

•	 With tension on the tow line, have another person pull  the release control in the tow plane cockpit and check  for proper release of the tow line.

 •	 If the tow line does not properly release, restrict the tow  plane from towing duties until repairs can be made.

 •	 Reattach the tow line and apply a moderate tug in the  direction of tow.  

•	 Inspect the release assembly to ensure it has remained  completely closed. •	 If the release assembly has opened, even partially,  restrict the tow plane from towing duties and repair  the tow assembly.  

# Tow Ring Inspection  

Tow ring inspection should begin with checking for wear and  tear. The rings should not be used if they have deep scratches  or dents. Like the tow hitch assembly, there are two types of  tow rings: Schweizer and Tost.  [Figure 12-5]  The Schweizer  tow ring is two inches in diameter and made of high grade,  one-quarter inch steel that has been magnafluxed with good  weld. The Tost tow ring is also made of high grade steel and  available through most glider supply companies.

Figure 12-5.  Schweizer tow ring and a Tost tow ring.  

Always ensure that the tow line is configured for the proper  type of hitch being used. For example, a Schweizer tow  ring will not fit into a Tost tow hitch, but a Tost tow ring  can be placed on a Schweizer type tow hitch (with the great  possiblility that the Tost tow ring will become stuck in the  hitch mechanism making tow rope release impossible).  

# Tow Rope Inspection  

Although the pilot of the glider is primarily responsible for the  selection and inspection of the proper tow line, it is also the duty  of the tow pilot to confirm that the tow line selected meets the  requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  Regulations and is acceptable for use.  [Figure 12-6]  The tow  line should be inspected as follows:  

![](images/c9669a6f42e2b165aa68571a645cdb7c0c11cca13a55ebc3c7c5577c5bae74f3.jpg)  
Figure 12-6.  It is both the tow pilot and glider pilots responsibility  to check the condition of the tow rope before flight.  

•	 Check the entire length of the tow line for abrasions,  security of splices, and general condition. •	 The tow line should be free from excess wear; all  strands should be intact, and the line should be free  from knots (knots in the tow line reduces its strength  by up to 50 percent and causes a high spot in the rope  that is more susceptible to wear).  •	 Pay particular attention to the ring area to which the  glider attaches because this is also a high-wear area. •	 Consideration should be given in replacing the tow  rope after a period of time due to usage and ultraviolet  (UV) exposure from being in the sun and exposed to  the elements. •	 Ensure tow line strength is appropriate for the glider  being towed.  

# Tow Rope Strength Requirements  

Stated in the 14 CFR part 91, section 91.309, the minimum  tow rope strength is eighty percent of the gliders maximum  certificated operating weight. The maximum strength is twice  the maximum certificated operating weight. The maximum  certificated operating weight can be found in the specific  pilot’s operating handbook (POH) for the glider and may be  the maximum certificated gross weight at takeoff.  Figure 12-7   shows the strength of some ropes that are typically used. If  the tow rope has a breaking strength more than twice the  maximum certificated operating weight of the glider being  towed, a safety link (weak link) has to be installed at the  point of attachment of the glider and the tow plane with the  following breaking strength requirements:  

![](images/84cef3637ca6d0c2403811907c36991eaeec0232056d2480a12b2dcbcde5faf6.jpg)  

# Figure 12-7.  Rope strengths.  

•	 Safety link (weak link) at the glider end:  •	 Minimum strength  $=$   eighty percent of the glider  maximum certificated operating weight.  •	 Maximum strength   $=$   twice the maximum  certificated operating weight.  [Figure 12-8] •	 Safety link (weak link) at the tow plane end:  •	 Strength requirements   $=$   greater, but not more  than twenty five percent greater than that of the  safety link on the glider end, and not more than  twice the maximum certificated operating weight  of the glider.  

Tow ropes and cables are made of many different reliable  materials, such as nylon, step-index fiber from Red Polyester,  Hollow Braid POLYPRO, Dacron, steel, and Polyethylene.  [Figure 12-9]  

# Take Off Planning  

After all inspections are complete, compute the takeoff  performance for the tow plane using the approved POH. As  a rule of thumb, the tow plane is normally airborne in about  twice the computed distance. If your tow plane does not have  takeoff performance charts, make a normal takeoff without  the glider in tow and note the lift-off point. Use this physical  point in lieu of computed takeoff data. Pay particular attention  to your altitude over the departure end of the runway and the  clearance of any barriers.  

![](images/13801d31fce8d4cb11c7eebe9302aaf6b5c8b4a32845b839e9936b8d62545d58.jpg)  
Figure 12-9.  Tow ropes and cables are made of many different  reliable materials such as nylon, step-index fiber from Red Polyester,  Hollow Braid POLYPRO, Dacron, steel, and Polyethylene.  

Using the computed takeoff data or actual takeoff point, choose a  physical abort point on the runway.  [Figure 12-10]  Thoroughly  brief the glider pilot on the abort point and abort procedures. If  the tow plane is not off the ground by the chosen abort point,  the glider should release, or be released, allowing the tow plane  to accomplish a normal takeoff.  

![](images/999a19215f6bb92ffdd3c4a43c097a0352dc779a2af63ff74081d36f7b1ebc22.jpg)

Figure 12-10.  A physical abort point on the runway should be determined and briefed to the glider pilot before starting the towing  procedures.  

Since density altitude is perhaps the single most important  factor affecting airplane performance, a review of the effects  of density altitude is in order. An increase in air temperature  and/or humidity significantly decreases power output and  propeller efficiency.  

The engine produces power in proportion to the weight or  density of the air. Therefore, as air density decreases (high  density altitude), the power output of the engine decreases.  Also, the propeller produces thrust in proportion to the mass  of air being accelerated through the rotating blades. If the air  is less dense, propeller efficiency is decreased.  

The problem of high density altitude operation is compounded  by the fact that when the air is less dense, more engine power  and increased propeller efficiency are needed to overcome  the decreased lift efficiency of the tow plane’s wing. This  additional power and propeller efficiency are not available  under high density altitude conditions; consequently, tow  plane performance decreases considerably.  

The winds aloft should be continuously evaluated to help  determine the glider release area and always attempt to  release the glider upwind of the airport. Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR), part 91, section 91.309 (a)(5) states, “The  pilot of the towing aircraft and the glider have agreed upon a  general course of action, including takeoff and release signals,  airspeeds, and emergency procedures for each pilot.” If there  is any doubt that this rule has not been complied with through  briefings or published and agreed upon standard operating  procedures, ensure both you as the tow pilot and the glider  pilot are absolutely clear on all aspects of the upcoming tow.  

# On the Airport  

The tow pilot must develop an awareness of the direction of  the tow plane’s prop blast. Blasting launch personnel and  glider canopies with all sorts of debris is undesirable and  potentially dangerous. Whenever possible, turn away from  any ground operations. Prior to taking the active runway  for tow line hook-up and takeoff, if available, monitor and  announce your intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory  Frequency (CTAF).  

# Ground Signals  

In most cases, the Standard American Soaring Signals are  used to communicate between the launch crew and tow plane.  In some cases, however, specific local procedures may be  in effect. The tow pilot should be thoroughly briefed on any  specific local procedures. The tow pilot may be required  to observe these signals through the mirror or through an  additional signal relay person positioned safely on the side  of the runway adjacent to the tow plane. The ground signals  are listed below and are also presented as illustrations in  Chapters 7 and 8 of this handbook.  

•	 Take up slack—the take up slack signal is given by  the ground crewmember moving his or her lowered  arm from side to side. When you receive this signal,  slowly taxi the tow plane forward to take up the slack  in the tow line. When all the slack has been taken from  the tow line, expect to receive the “hold” signal from  the ground crew.  

•	 Hold—this signal is given by holding the arms out  straight.  

•	 Pilot ready, wings level—when the glider pilot is ready  for takeoff, a thumbs up signal is given and the wing  runner will level the wing to the takeoff position.  

•	 Begin takeoff—the glider pilot waggles the rudder  with the wings level and the wing runner signals  with a circular motion of the arm. When ready  for takeoff, the tow pilot should broadcast on the  CTAF that a glider launch is about to be initiated.  For example, “Tallahasee traffic, N12345 taking off  Runway 33, glider in tow, Tallahasee.” Remember,  14 CFR part 91, section 91.309, requires that before  conducting towing operations within Class B, C, D, or  E airspace designated for an airport, or before making  each towing flight within such controlled airspace if  

required by ATC, the pilot in charge (PIC) must notify  the control tower. If a control tower does not exist or  is not in operation, the PIC must notify the FAA flight  service station (FSS) serving that controlled airspace  before conducting any towing operations.  

•	 Stop engine/release tow line—this signal is given by  moving a hand back and forth across the throat.  

•	 Tow plane ready—prior to takeoff, carefully look at  the glider to ensure the glider dive brakes are closed  and no one is standing in front of the wings or so close  to the launch path to create a hazard. It is important  to note, however, that some high-performance gliders  may make their initial takeoff roll with spoilers  open. Know your gliders and if in doubt, do not be  ashamed to question the glider pilot. Better to be a bit  embarrassed than to end up in the trees at the end of  the runway. Additionally, the tow pilot should ensure  that the traffic pattern is clear of aircraft. Once assured  that the glider is ready and the briefed departure path  is clear, the ready for takeoff signal may be given with  a waggle of the tow plane rudder.  

a waving motion of the arms above the head.  

# Takeoff and Climb  

The takeoff is done by advancing the throttle smoothly and  quickly in one motion.  [Figure 12-11]  If the tow plane is  allowed to accelerate and then slow down, the glider may  overrun the tow line. This may result in the tow line becoming  tangled in the landing gear of the glider. The glider may then  be unable to release. Accelerate to liftoff speed keeping in  mind that during the takeoff phase of flight, ground effect  produces some important relationships. The tow plane  leaving ground effect will:  

![](images/1dc33c7e33f30f8f1d04a9dbb71e759affb47b2c62a2f331e19d6f9fc9d759c7.jpg)  
Figure 12-11.  The takeoff is done by smoothly and quickly advancing  the throttle in one motion so that the glider does not overrun the  tow line.  

•	 Require an increase in the angle of attack (AOA) to  maintain the same lift coefficient; •	 Experience an increase in induced drag and thrust  required; •	 Experience a decrease in stability and a nose-up  change in moment; and •	 Produce a reduction in static source pressure and  increase in indicated airspeed.  

These general effects should point out the possible danger  in attempting takeoff prior to achieving the recommended  lift-off speed. Due to the reduced drag in ground effect,  the tow plane may seem capable of takeoff well below the  recommended speed; however, lifting out of ground effect  with a lower than normal lift off speed may result in very  marginal initial climb performance.  

The glider will normally liftoff first. The pilot of the  glider should correct for crosswind until the tow plane  becomes airborne.  

At this point, the tow pilot must remain extra alert. The tail  of the tow plane may be lifted if the glider climbs too high.  Should this happen, the application of full-up elevator on the  tow plane may not be sufficient to prevent an accident from  happening. The tow pilot must be ready to pull the release  handle, releasing the glider and regaining control. As a rule  of thumb, the use of a 200 foot tow line would require the  glider to climb to over 20 feet above the altitude of the tow  plane to present a danger of upset.  

After liftoff, a constant airspeed climb should be established.  The pilot of the glider should establish a position directly  behind the tow plane. The pilot of the tow plane should  maintain a constant ground track on the initial climb. Upon  reaching a safe altitude, a turn may be established to maintain  the desired departure path. Bank angle should be limited to  a maximum of   $15{-}20^{\circ}$  .  

Climb at full throttle unless otherwise required by the POH.  The fuel/air mixture should be leaned only in accordance with  the POH for maximum power. Each specific model of glider  has a published maximum aerotow speed, and the tow pilot  must be familiar with this speed, which may be very close  to the minimum safe speed of the tow plane.  [Figure 12-12]  

The tow pilot should understand that these are maximum  airspeeds. Plan to fly at a speed slower than the maximum  while maintaining safe tow plane flying speed. When towing  a different model of glider for the first time, obtain a briefing  from the glider pilot to ensure compliance with maximum  

![Figure 12-12.  Maximum aerotow speeds.  ](images/cda96a75eefdc395c2835c1d4acd8131da9c0342ed31630cdc2a44a634b91823.jpg)  

operating speeds. Also note fiberglass gliders, like the ASK- 21, are towed faster than other popular training gliders.  

Recommended towing speed is determined by considering  stall speed and maximum aerotow speed of the glider,  minimum speed for proper engine cooling of the tow plane,  and stall speed of the tow plane. Generally speaking, aerotow  should be conducted at the slowest speed possible considering  these factors and safety. Speed should be at least thirty  percent above stall speed of the glider and twenty percent  above the stall speed of the tow plane.  

Because of the potential for low altitude emergencies, the  initial climb must remain upwind and within gliding distance  of the airport. If circumstances do not permit an upwind  departure, plan the climb to remain in a position that allows  the glider to return to the traffic pattern with the existing  headwind component.  

When towing, expect the glider to practice maneuvers such  as “Boxing the Wake,” which is explained and illustrated  in Chapter 7 of this handbook. A thoughtful glider pilot  communicates the intention to maneuver behind the tow  plane. However, the tow pilot should remain alert for  unannounced maneuvering. Glider pilot’s normally begin  the “Box the Wake” maneuver by descending vertically  from high tow position to low tow position. Once a similar  maneuver is detected, maintain a constant heading and a  wings level attitude. After the “Box the Wake” maneuver is  completed and the glider is stabilized in the hig-tow position,  turns can be resumed.  

During tow, the glider instructor may demonstrate and  practice slack rope recovery procedures. This maneuver  normally involves a climb to one side or the other followed by  a small dive to create the slack in the tow line. The instructor  will then have the student take the slack out of the tow line  without breaking the rope. Be alert for these maneuvers and  do not mistake the climb and dive maneuver as a release.  This maneuver is discussed in further detail in Chapter 8 of  this handbook.  

# Tow Positions, Turns, and Release  

# Glider Tow Positions  

The high tow is normally used for glider tow operations.  However, a low-tow position may be used in some instances,  a cross-country tow for example. The main goal of both  positions is to place the glider in a position that avoids the  wake of the tow plane.  [Figure 12-13]  

![](images/4b4997fe1900c3de95b073713b9ce803390389ad38def742398cef29f9d6d8e0.jpg)  
Figure 12-13. Aerotow climb-out.  

# Turns on Tow  

All turns should be performed in a gentle and gradual  manner. The pilot of the glider will attempt to fly the exact  flightpath of the tow plane. To do this, the pilot points the  nose of the glider at the outside wing tip of the tow plane  during a turn.  

Turns may be initiated upon reaching a safe altitude.  Consideration should be given to obstruction clearance,  terrain, and wind gradient. Turbulence and differential  wing speed of the glider during turns are potential sources  of problems.  

Due to the length of the wingspan, the roll rate of a glider is  typically slower than that of the tow plane. Consequently,  the tow pilot should plan all turns with the understanding  that the angle of bank determines the turn radius. Since the  bank angles of the tow plane and glider must match to fly the  same path, normally a maximum of  $15{-}20^{\circ}$   of bank is used.  

# Approaching a Thermal  

When approaching a thermal, be vigilant of other gliders.  Since the first glider in the thermal establishes the direction  of turn, any glider joining the thermal is required to circle in  the same direction as the first glider. This requires the tow  pilot to position the flight in a manner that allows the glider  proper and safe entry to the thermal. Be super alert when  approaching thermals with circling gliders. Expect other  gliders to be inbound to the thermal from all directions. Give  the thermal traffic a wide berth. If the thermal appears to be  especially crowded, steer clear of the activity.  

# Release  

Standard glider release procedures are as follows  [Figure 12-14]  

1.	 The pilot of the glider should ensure the tow line is  relatively tight, with no excessive slack, prior to release.  This allows the tow pilot to feel the release of the glider.  If the tow rope is visible in the mirror, look for the  wrinkle in the tow rope after the glider has released.  

![](images/8cf0b184bbb4f5506a2f5a20a0f1201981d4be95ba6a01ebe8d8efe230b37643.jpg)  

2.	 Once it has been confirmed that the glider has released  and is clear, the tow pilot should clear the airspace to  the left and start a medium bank, descending left turn.  

3.	 The glider should turn right after release but may  proceed straight ahead a few moments before turning  right. Always be alert for non-standard maneuvering  by the glider.  

When the tow pilot has positively observed and confirmed  the release of the tow line (assumption of release is not  acceptable), the pilot of the tow plane may begin a left turn  and initiate the descent. In some instances, the glider will  release with slack in the tow line. This soft release may  not be detectable by the tow pilot. If there is any doubt of  the release status in the mind of the tow pilot, the tow pilot  should continue the tow and confirm the release via radio  or visually.  

# Descent, Approach and Landing  

# Descent  

During the descent, proper engine management is essential.  Good engine conservation practices require a gradual power  reduction and conservative descent airspeeds. In fact, studies  indicate that airspeed may be more critical than power  reduction. Therefore, every attempt should be made to avoid  airspeed acceleration and power reduction for 3 minutes after  glider release. Full flaps or slipping turns can be used to obtain a  suitable rate of descent. Closing cowl flaps, if available, further  reduces the rate of engine cooling. Realize oil temperature  is not as reliable as cylinder head temperature for managing  temperature change. Each airplane requires slightly different  techniques; however, the goal is to keep the engine as warm  as possible while descending at a reasonable rate.  

Collision avoidance is always a high priority, since  descending flight attitudes increase the potential of a mid-air  collision. Consider developing and using specific descent  corridors that are void of glider and power traffic.  

# Approach and Landing  

A 200-foot tow line hangs down behind the tow plane at a  30 to 40 degree angle. The altitude of the tow plane must be  adjusted to ensure the tow line does not become entangled  in obstructions at close proximity to the ground.  

Ensure you are thoroughly briefed and familiar with the  obstructions around the airport, especially obstructions  on the approach end of the runway to be used. Briefings  should include a minimum above ground level (AGL)  obstruction crossing height and any factors that may  influence altitude judgment, such as visual illusions or other  airport distractions.  

Landing with the tow line attached is not prohibited by  regulation; however, the following points should be considered:  

1.	 Obstructions are cleared by more than the tow line  length (altimeter lag considered). 2.	 The field is well turfed. It is simply inviting early  tow line failure from abrasion to land with the tow  line on hard ground or paved runways. Landing with  the tow line should never be attempted unless the  field has clear approaches and is at least 2,500 feet  in length.  

Other situations require the tow line to be dropped, normally  in the glider launch area, during short approach to the  runway. If the tow line is to be dropped, the tow pilot must  be constantly aware of the launch area situation. The tow  line drop area must be defined and ground personnel must be  briefed and aware of the drop area. Ground personnel must  stay clear of the drop area, and the presence of an individual  in the drop area requires an immediate go-around by the pilot  of the tow plane without dropping the tow line.  

# Cross-Country Aerotow  

Planning is the key for a successful and safe cross-county  tow.  [Figure 12-15]  Fuel consumption during any tow  operation is high. Plan conservatively, using the maximum  fuel consumption for your particular tow plane and also plan  for the possibility of a diversion along your route of flight.  Study your route of flight on current sectional charts paying  particular attention to airspace, both controlled and special use.  

![](images/08214854b2a3b35d8b25f6490ff6af337289949288c1b5d32cf2ea8d18f423f9.jpg)  
Figure 12-15.  Cross-country tow.  

Since a tow line break is a constant possibility, always plan  your route of flight over landable terrain and, while in flight,  strive to keep the glider over landable terrain. Tow and glider  pilot fatigue is a real hazard. Make sure you are properly  rested and in good medical condition prior to the flight. If  the flight is particularly long, plan rest stops along the way,  if feasible. Think about water requirements to keep hydrated  and the inevitable physiological requirement. Use aircraft  trim to ensure the maximum tow speed of the glider is not  exceeded and to help reduce pilot fatigue.  

Two-way communication between the glider and the tow  plane is essential during cross-country tows. Ensure portable  radios and glider batteries are fully charged prior to the flight  and conduct a radio check as part of your pre-flight activities.  [Figure 12-16]  

![](images/6c2190dcd0947666ed4f21d444363a691afef0b8440bed0de825cf5852a15e7c.jpg)  
Figure 12-16.  On a cross-country tow, the tow pilot and glider  pilot should have two way communication using portable radios.  

# Emergencies  

# Takeoff Emergencies  

The key to ensuring successful emergency management is  the development of an emergency plan. Prior to takeoff,  an emergency release point should be selected somewhere  along the takeoff runway. This release point should leave  sufficient room to land straight ahead, using normal stopping  techniques, in the event conditions are such that a safe takeoff  with the glider in tow cannot be completed.  

During the initial climb out, the pilot of the glider will be  noting certain altitudes that correspond to actions he or she  will take in the event of a low-altitude emergency.  

# Tow Plane Power Failure on the Runway During  Takeoff Roll  

The following actions should be taken in the event the tow  plane has a power failure on the runway during the takeoff roll:  

•	 The glider should release or be released by the tow  plane and, if possible, maneuver right of the runway. •	 The tow plane should maneuver to the left of the runway  if space is available. (Realize each individual airfield  layout and obstacles may dictate an alternate procedure,  so take the time to plan your actions prior to takeoff.) •	 Survey the abort area carefully and know where  you can exit the runway (grass or taxi-way) without  causing a hazard. Always have a plan.  •	 Realize the glider will probably be airborne, therefore  try and give the glider as much space as possible to  land on the remaining runway and brake to a stop. •	 Know the stopping characteristics of the glider you  are towing. Some models have very effective brakes,  others do not.  

# Glider Releases During Takeoff With Tow Plane  Operation Normal  

The pilot of the tow plane should continue the takeoff  eliminating a collision hazard with the glider.  

# Tow Plane Power Failure or Tow Rope Break After  Takeoff but Below 200 Feet Above Ground Level  

The pilot of the glider will normally release and descend  straight ahead or maneuver using slight turns to make a  specific forced landing. Because of airport obstructions in  close proximity to the airport, the options available for a  tow plane or glider land out may be limited. Discuss these  options during the pilot briefing or safety meetings. Again,  a plan will go a long way in ensuring a successful land out  as a result of a takeoff emergency.  

# Tow Plane Power Failure or Tow Rope Break After  Takeoff Above 200 Feet  

The glider can more than likely return to the field in the event  of engine failure or rope break. Since the tow plane requires  considerably more altitude to return to the field in the event of  a power failure, the pilot should have a specific plan in mind  that includes pre-selected landing areas for each runway.  

# Glider Climbs Excessively High During Takeoff  

The tail of the tow plane may be lifted if the glider climbs  excessively high during takeoff. Should this happen, the  application of full-up elevator on the tow plane may not be  sufficient to prevent an accident. The tow pilot must be ready  to pull the release handle in order to regain control of the tow  plane. As a rule of thumb, use of a 200-foot tow line would  require the glider to climb to over 20 feet above the altitude  of the tow plane to present a danger of upset.  

If at any time the nose of the tow plane is pulled uncontrollably  by the glider to a dangerously high or low pitch attitude— PULL THE RELEASE.  

If a Schweizer tow hitch is being used, it may be possible  for the release mechanism to become jammed due to the  excessively high position of the glider.  

# Airborne Emergencies  Glider Release Failure  

If the pilot of the glider is unable to release, the tow pilot  should be informed by means of the aircraft radio or by the  following airborne signal. The glider will move out to the left  side of the towplane and rock its wings.  [Figure 12-17]  Be  sure not to mistake the wing rock as the beginning of a normal  release. Wait a few seconds to ensure the glider’s wings are  rocking. Once the tow pilot has determined the glider cannot  release the tow plane should return to the airfield and release  the glider at a safe altitude over the field.  

![](images/02819fa2a400bcfec1ae87886c24f41570c44b94db10033b5704262962493cf6.jpg)  
Figure 12-17.  Glider release failure.  

# Neither the Tow Plane or Glider Can Release  

This is an extremely rare event. Although as improbable as  this situation may be, you must be prepared. The pilot of the  tow plane should inform the pilot of the glider by aircraft  radio or airborne signal. The signal is accomplished by  yawing the tail of the tow plane.  

The glider should move to the low tow position. Then the  tow plane should begin a slow descent toward an airfield of  suitable length. Fly a wide pattern ending up on an extended  final approach. Set up a very stabilized and gradual (200–300  foot per minute (fpm)) descent. Plan on landing long and  allowing sufficient altitude while on short final for the glider  to avoid approach obstacles.  

Since the glider is lower than the tow plane, it lands first. The  glider should not apply brakes until the tow plane has touched  down. After touchdown, apply brakes gently or not at all,  slowly coming to a stop. Remember, most glider brakes are  not that effective, so allow the glider plenty of runway to stop.  

While not well defined in soaring literature, some glider  pilots are taught to attempt to break the tow rope rather  than land behind the tow plane. If the glider does attempt  to break the rope, maintain the tow plane in a straight and  level attitude in an attempt to reduce the total gravity forces  of the glider’s maneuver.  

# Glider Problem  

You may notice the glider has a problem that is obviously  not being detected by the glider pilot. The most common is  the failure of the glider pilot to close and lock the glider’s  spoilers/airbrakes prior to takeoff, resulting in an inadvertent  undetected deployment of spoilers as the glider accelerates  during takeoff. If you notice a problem with the glider, inform  the glider pilot via radio and visual signal. The visual signal  for “Glider Problem” is waggling the rudder while airborne.  

# Immediate Release  

This situation requires immediate action by the pilot of the  glider. Should the tow pilot rock the wings of the tow plane,  the pilot of the glider must release immediately. Obviously,  this would be appropriate during a time critical tow plane  emergency, such as engine-failure or fire.  [Figure 12-18]  

![](images/84ef65f093a21f76acda1214297730b7a3e18c49e340139cbce65aeaf9c8b3d3.jpg)

# Chapter 13 Human Factors  

# Introduction  

The term human factors is often associated with ergonomics  and is documented as the only discipline that focuses on the  interaction of humans and technology.  [Figure 13-1]  When  referring to human factors, we immediately think of the 3  Ds: development, design, and deployment of systems and  devices that improve system-human interface. While there  is much more to human factors than the 3 Ds, behavior  intervention and modification is a necessary component to  ensuring a safer aviation environment. As there have been  great strides over recent decades to decrease the number of  aviation accidents, human error remains the biggest hurdle for  safety professionals. Research has shown nearly 80 percent of  aviation accidents are attributed to human error. As a result  of this finding, the aviation environment must rely heavily  on minimizing human error to ensure a safer air space. This  chapter focuses specifically on key elements associated with  human error and systems related to glider flying operations as  well as some of the physiological issues involved in soaring.

# Learning from Past Mistakes  

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) generates  accident reports any time a reportable glider accident occurs.  This information is open to the public and can be found at  www.ntsb.gov/ntsb. Once on the accident query page, enter  the term “glider,” which retrieves all reports pertaining to  gliders to include tow plane accidents. It is important for  pilots to review NTSB accident reports and learn what  the common errors and hazards are that apply to glider  operations.  Learning from others mistakes helps reduce  future accident rates.  

An NTSB query from November 1, 2010, through October  31, 2011, shows 27 glider accidents. Shown in  Figure 13-2 are some of the accidents reported during that time to include  the type of aircraft, injuries, and the probable cause of the  accident (if given).  

# Recognizing Hazardous Attitudes  

It is important that pilots ensure their flight is safe by following  procedures and checklists rather than hope for a safe flight  and doing things they know are not right. As technological  advances have contributed to fewer mechanical failures,  which in turn has created a much safer air space, human  error remains a constant factor in aviation accidents. There  is a wealth of information available that focuses on unsafe  behaviors and attitudes. For the purpose of this chapter, three  common behaviors are addressed: complacency, indiscipline,  and overconfidence. While complacency, indiscipline, and  overconfidence share a common theme (each stem from  experience), it is necessary to further delineate on the  contributions of attitude-behavior linkage. To do so, we must  further explore each term respectively.  

# Complacency  

Often glider operations can seem less stressful than other  modes of flight for no other reason than the “meditative  silence” that accompanies gliding through the air. This is why  complacency can easily materialize. Complacency is when  a person has a sense of security about one’s surrounding yet  fails to recognize or lacks awareness of possible danger. As  pilots accrue flight time, their experience increases and, while  one might view this as positive, their experience complacency  may emerge. All too often, with experience comes boredom,  a desire to cut corners, distractibility, feelings of content,  minimal performance, and intentionally overlooking basic  safety precautions (i.e., “I’ve done this a million times, it is  not necessary to follow a checklist.”).  

A few countermeasures include:  

•	 Never assume all facets related to the flight will  go smoothly. •	 Always prepare and expect the unexpected.  

![](images/90f2f5b9c9ad8f1a2fbaf320e2009b80860fc9497beca39a411817cdeb772a41.jpg)  

•	 Play the “what if” game and offer solutions to the  scenarios you create.  

The key to preventing complacency is keeping your mind  sharp at all times by “being proactive rather than reactive.”  

# Indiscipline  

Much like complacency, as pilots gain experience the failure  to comply with certain standards seem to be evident in many  aviation accidents. Either they feel their experience has taught  them an easier or faster way to do certain tasks, or their attitude  is not in alignment with the guidelines set forth by more  experienced aviators. Nevertheless, indiscipline can be a very  dangerous attitude that can easily lead to unsafe behaviors.  

# Overconfidence  

Similarly to complacency, familiar circumstances or  repetition can lead to a state of overconfidence. Developing  and maintaining a sense of confidence toward your abilities  is acceptable unless it leads to cutting corners and ignoring  proper procedure.  

# Human Error  

Human error is defined as a human action with unintended  consequences. There is nothing inherently wrong or  troublesome with error itself, but when you couple error  with aviation and the negative consequences that it  produces it becomes extremely troublesome. Training, flight  examinations (written or oral), and operational checks  should  not be restricted to attempt to avoid errors but rather to make  them visible and identify them before they produce damaging  and regrettable consequences. Simply put, human error is not  avoidable but it is manageable.  [Figure 13-3]  

# Types of Errors Unintentional  

An unintentional error is an unintentional wandering or  deviation from accuracy. This can include an error in your  action (a slip), opinion, or judgment caused by poor reasoning,  carelessness or insufficient knowledge (a mistake). For  example, a pilot reads the glider performance numbers from  

![](images/b956755b7d429593a1e63a671ebe22ebe33e6cba15a3434f9c2660b99bf5c2a2.jpg)  
Figure 13-3.  Safety awareness will help foresee and mitigate the  risk of human error.  

the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) and unintentionally  transposed the number 62 to 26. He or she did not mean to  make that error but unknowingly and unintentionally did.  

# Intentional  

In aviation, an intentional error should really be considered  a flight violation. If someone knowingly or intentionally  chooses to do something wrong, it is a violation, which  means that one has deviated from safe practices, procedures,  standards, or regulations.  

# Human and Physiological Factors that  Affect Flight  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is a major human factor that has contributed to many  maintenance errors resulting in accidents. Fatigue can be  mental or physical in nature. Emotional fatigue also exists  and effects mental and physical performance. A person is  said to be fatigued when a reduction or impairment in any  of the following occurs: cognitive ability, decision-making,  reaction time, coordination, speed, strength, and balance.  Fatigue reduces alertness and often reduces a person’s ability  to focus and hold attention on the task being performed.  [Figure 13-4]  

Symptoms of fatigue may also include short-term memory  problems, channeled concentration on unimportant issues  while neglecting other factors that may be more important,  and failure to maintain a situational overview. A fatigued  person may be easily distracted or may be nearly impossible  to distract. He or she may experience abnormal mood swings.  Fatigue results in an increase in mistakes, poor judgment,  and poor decisions or perhaps no decisions at all. A fatigued  person may also lower his or her standards.  

![](images/8a429e658c90ae7d17414c3332c77a0e34d84ec02d8611dc2a9d9391a7c97dc5.jpg)  
Figure 13-4.  Fatigue can be mental or physical and effects both  mental and physical performance.  

Tiredness is a symptom of fatigue. However, sometimes  a fatigued person may feel wide awake and engaged in a  task. The primary cause of fatigue is a lack of sleep. Good  restful sleep free from drugs or alcohol is a human necessity  to prevent fatigue. Fatigue can also be caused by stress and  by overworking. A person’s mental and physical state also  naturally cycles through various levels of performance each  day. Variables such as body temperature, blood pressure, heart  rate, blood chemistry, alertness, and attention rise and fall  in a pattern daily. This is known as one’s circadian rhythm.  [Figure 13-5]  A person’s ability to work (and rest) rises and  falls during this cycle. Performance counter to circadian  rhythm can be difficult. Until it becomes extreme, a person may  be unaware that he or she is fatigued. It is easier recognized  by another person or in the results of tasks being performed.  Flying alone when fatigued is particularly dangerous.  

The best remedy for fatigue is to get enough sleep on a regular  basis. Pilots must be aware of the amount and quality of  sleep obtained. Countermeasures to fatigue are often used.  Effectiveness can be short lived and many countermeasures  may make fatigue worse. Caffeine is a common fatigue  countermeasure. Pseudoephedrine found in sinus medicine  and amphetamines are also used. While effective for short  periods, a fatigued person remains fatigued and may have  trouble getting the rest needed once they try to sleep.

Figure 13-5.  Many human variables rise and fall daily due to one’s natural circadian rhythm.  

If you find yourself suffering from acute fatigue, stay on the  ground. Glider pilots often become fatigued while flying  due to soaring in close proximity to other gliders in areas of  lift or because of the constant requirement to see and avoid  other traffic. Getting adequate rest is the only way to prevent  fatigue from occurring. You should avoid flying when you  have not had a full night’s rest, when you have been working  excessive hours, or have had an especially exhausting or  stressful day. If you suspect you are suffering from chronic  fatigue, consult your doctor.  

# Hyperventilation  

Hyperventilation occurs when you are experiencing  emotional stress, fright, or pain, and your breathing rate  and depth increase, although the carbon dioxide is already  at a reduced level in the blood. This can happen to both the  experienced and novice pilot.  Hyperventilation causes an  excessive loss of carbon dioxide from your body, which  can lead to unconsciousness due to the respiratory system’s  overriding mechanism to regain control of breathing.  

Glider pilots who encounter extreme or unexpected  turbulence or strong areas of sink over rough terrain or water  may unconsciously increase their breathing rate.  When flying  at higher altitudes, either with or without oxygen, a tendency  to breathe more rapidly than normal may occur, which can  lead to hyperventilation.  

It is important to know the symptoms of hyperventilation  and correctly treat for it.  [Figure 13-6]  Treatment for  hyperventilation involves restoring the proper carbon dioxide  level back in the body. Breathing normally is both the best  

![](images/0e666fb4b7d3dd44f762454170653c17fb06217438897346f048e899a0dad215.jpg)  
Figure 13-6.  Common symptoms of hyperventilation.  

prevention and the best cure for hyperventilation. In addition  to slowing the breathing rate, you also can breathe into a paper  bag or talk aloud to over-come hyperventilation. Recovery is  usually rapid once the breathing rate is returned to normal.  

# Inner Ear Discomfort  

Gliders are not pressurized, therefore, pressure changes can  affect glider pilots that are flying at high altitudes. Inner ear  pain and a temporary reduction in ability to hear are caused  by the ascents and descents of the glider. The physiological  explanation for this discomfort is a difference between the  pressure of the air outside the body and the air inside the  middle ear. The middle ear cavity is small and located in the  bone of the skull. While the external ear canal is always at the  same pressure as the outside air, the pressure in the middle ear  often changes more slowly. Even a slight difference between  external pressure and middle ear pressure can cause discomfort.  

When a glider ascends, middle ear air pressure may exceed  the pressure of the air in the external ear canal, causing the  eardrum to bulge outward. This pressure change becomes  apparent when you experience alternate sensations of  “fullness” and “clearing.” During a descent, the reverse  happens. While the pressure of the air in the external ear  canal increases, the middle ear cavity, which equalized with  the lower pressure at altitude, is at lower pressure than the  external ear canal. The result is higher outside pressure,  causing the eardrum to bulge inward.  

This condition can be more difficult to relieve due to the fact  that air must be introduced into the middle ear through the  eustachian tube to equalize the pressure. The inner ear is a  partial vacuum and tends to constrict the walls of the eustachian  tube. To correct this often painful condition, which causes  temporary reduction in hearing sensitivity, pinch your nostrils,  close your mouth and lips, and blow slowly and gently in the  mouth and nose. This procedure, called the valsalva maneuver,  forces air up the eustachian tube into the middle ear.  

# Spatial Disorientation  

For glider pilots, prevention is the best remedy for spatial  disorientation. If the glider you are flying is not equipped for  instrument flight, and you do not have many hours of training  in controlling the glider by reference to instruments, it is  best to avoid flight in reduced visibility or at night when the  horizon is not visible. Susceptibility to disorienting illusions  can be reduced through training, awareness, and learning to  rely totally on your flight instruments.  [Figure 13-7]  

![](images/76575252d826462820f99e79c20fc396d87a0b5db265f71eb82b6ee595e5a833.jpg)  
Figure 13-7.  Learning to rely totally on flight instruments to fly  will reduce the likelihood of experiencing a disorienting illusion  while in flight.  

# Dehydration  

Dehydration is the term given to a critical loss of water from  the body. The first noticeable effect of dehydration is fatigue,  which in turn makes top physical and mental performance  difficult, if not impossible. Glider pilots often fly for a  long period of time in hot summer temperatures or at high  altitudes. This makes dehydration very likely for two reasons:  the gliders clear canopy offers no protection from the sun and,  at high altitudes, there are fewer air pollutants to diffuse the  sun’s rays. The result is continual exposure to heat that the  body attempts to regulate by perspiration. If this fluid is not  replaced, fatigue progresses to dizziness, weakness, nausea,  tingling of hands and feet, abdominal cramps, and extreme  thirst.  [Figure 13-8]  

![](images/837c673068462c592e8c0ef71d5e8db6cb253a03100fb637084e2d849453d615.jpg)  
Figure 13-8.  Symptoms of dehydration.  

Water should be taken on every flight to prevent dehydration.  The effects of dehydration on a pilot’s performance are subtle,  but can be dangerous and are especially a factor in warmer  climates. Some glider pilots wear a hat to block the sun from  distracting their ability to fly and see the instruments. Pilots  should ensure that the brim of the hat is not too large, which can  interfere with the ability to scan for other gliders and air traffic.  

# Heatstroke  

Heatstroke is a condition caused by any inability of the body  to control its temperature. Onset of this condition may be  recognized by the symptoms of dehydration, but also has  been known to be recognized only by complete collapse. To  prevent these symptoms, it is recommended that you carry  an ample supply of water and use it at frequent intervals on  any long flight, whether you are thirsty or not. Wearing light  colored, porous clothing and a hat provides protection from  the sun. It is also helpful to keep the cockpit well ventilated,  which aids in dispelling excess heat.  

# Cold Weather  

When flying at higher altitudes, the inside of the glider can get  cold. Proper clothing is a must since temperatures of  $-30^{\circ}$   to   $-60\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   may be encountered at altitude. Proper preparation for  the cold is especially difficult since temperatures on the ground  are often pleasant on wave soaring days. Sunshine through the  canopy keeps the upper body amazingly warm for a time, but  shaded legs and feet quickly become cold. Frostbite is a very  real threat. After an hour or two at such temperatures, even  the upper body can become quite cold. Layered, loose-fitting  clothing helps insulate body heat. Either wool gloves or light,  fitted gloves with mittens over them work best for the hands.  Mittens make tasks such as turning radio knobs difficult. For  the feet, two or three pairs of socks (inner, silk; outer, wool)  with an insulated boot are recommended.  

In addition, the low temperatures can cause two other  symptoms: it frosts your exhaled breath on the inside of  the canopy and it causes the kidneys to excrete liquid at an  accelerated rate.  

A clean piece of cloth (that will not damage the canopy) can  be used to wipe the condensation or frost from the canopy, if  needed, but the best way to clear the canopy is a little fresh  air through the side or front vent to help delay the buildup  of frost. Unfortunately, this also quickly lowers the inside  temperature, so it is best to wear clothing in layers so that  you can easily take off or put on what is needed. There is  little that can be done for the kidneys excreting liquid at an  accelerated rate. The best course of action is to plan for it  in advance by making a bathroom stop before you take off.  Remember that the body is dehydrating more rapidly because  of the cold and always be looking for signs of dehydration.  

# Cockpit Management  

Prior to launch, passengers should be briefed on the use of  safety belts, shoulder harnesses, and emergency procedures.  If ballast is used, it must be properly secured. Organize the  cockpit so items needed in flight are accessible. All other items  must be securely stowed. The necessary charts and cross- country aids should be stowed within easy reach of the pilot.  

# Personal Equipment  

If a parachute of the approved type is to be available for  emergencies, Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) part 91 requires that a certificated and appropriately- rated parachute rigger repack it within the preceding 180  days if it is made of nylon. The packing date information is  usually found on a card contained in a small pocket on the  body of the parachute.  

# Oxygen System  

14 CFR part 91 also requires that the pilot in command  (PIC)  use supplemental oxygen for flights more than 30 minutes  in duration above 12,500 feet and at all times during a flight  above 14,000 feet. If supplemental oxygen is used, the system  should be checked for flow, availability, and the PRICE  checklist should be used:  

•	  $\mathrm{P}=$   Pressure •	  ${\bf R}={\bf\rho}$   Regulator •	  $\mathrm{~I~}=$   Indicator •	  $\mathrm{C}=$   Connections •	  $\mathrm{E}=$   Emergency bail-out bottle  

The importance of understanding the need for oxygen  equipment in gliders has been heightened in recent years by a  considerable increase in the number of high-altitude soaring  flights. The exploration of mountain waves has led to numerous  flights at altitudes in excess of 30,000 feet with several record  flights in excess of 40,000 feet. In some parts of the country, it  is frequently possible to soar to a 16,000- to 18,000-foot cloud  base in thermals. In almost all parts of the United States such  altitudes are attainable in cumulonimbus clouds.  

At 18,000 feet, air density is only one-half that at sea level.  The purpose of breathing is to supply oxygen to the blood  and remove carbon dioxide. In each breath at 18,000 feet,  the pilot breathes in only half as much oxygen as at sea  level. This is not enough to deliver an adequate supply of  oxygen to the blood, and the situation worsens as altitude  increases. The automatic reaction is to breathe twice as fast.  This hyperventilation, or overbreathing, is almost worse than  going up without oxygen in the first place because it results  in eliminating too much carbon dioxide from the blood. The  immediate effects of hyperventilation are:  

•	 Spots before the eyes •	 Dizzy feeling •	 Numbing of fingers and toes, followed by possible  unconsciousness  

The dangers of oxygen deprivation should not be taken  lightly. At around 20,000 feet MSL, pilots might have only  10 minutes of “useful consciousness.” By 30,000 feet MSL,  the time frame for “useful consciousness” decreases to 1  minute or less. For planned flights above 25,000 feet MSL, an  emergency oxygen backup or bailout bottle should be carried.  

The U.S. Air Force in cooperation with the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) provides a 1-day, high- altitude orientation and chamber ride for civilian pilots.  The experience is invaluable for any pilot contemplating  high-altitude soaring and is even required by many clubs  and operations as a prerequisite.  

# Aviation Oxygen Systems  

Aviation oxygen systems are designed for airborne aviation  applications. Unlike a medical-type oxygen system, an  aviation system is generally much lighter, compact, and  calibrated to deliver oxygen based on extensive research in  human flight physiology. Prior to purchasing any type of  oxygen system, pilots should research the different options  and choose an oxygen system that is appropriate for the type  of flying that they do because there are many manufacturers  and types of system available. Two common types of  systems used today are the Continuous-Flow System and the  Electronic Pulse Demand Oxygen System (EDS).  

# Continuous-Flow System  

The continuous-flow system uses a high-pressure storage  tank and a pressure-reducing regulating valve that reduces  the pressure in the cylinder to approximately atmospheric  pressure at the mask.  [Figure 13-9]  The oxygen flow is  continuous as long as the system is turned on. In some  installations, it is possible to adjust the amount of oxygen flow  manually for low, intermediate, and high altitudes; automatic  regulators adjust the oxygen flow by means of a bellows,  which varies the flow according to altitude. When using the  continuous-flow oxygen system, the pilot can use either an  oxygen mask or a nasal cannula.  [Figures 13-10  and  13-11]  

![](images/f8de2de7ebd68f8e82b305e2f8eec16b89e80173ab29c031e5ebe13bd3c50188.jpg)  
Figure 13-9.  Continuous-flow oxygen system.  

Electronic Pulse Demand Oxygen System (EDS) The EDS is the lightest, smallest, and most capable on-demand  oxygen system available that delivers altitude-compensated  pulses of oxygen only as you inhale, using as little as   $\%$  ,  typically  $\%$   the amount of oxygen at  $\%$   the weight and volume  over conventional constant-flow systems that deliver one liter  per minute per 10,000 feet.  [Figure 13-12]  The EDS has a  precision micro-electronic pressure altitude barometer that  automatically determines the volume for each oxygen pulse  up to pressure altitudes of 32,000 feet and higher altitudes  are compensated with pulses of greater volume. The EDS  automatically goes to a 100 percent pulse-demand mode at  pressure altitudes above 32,000 feet.

Figure 13-12.  Electronic Pulse Demand Oxygen System (EDS).  

The EDS can be set to one of three D (day or delayed) modes  and delays, responding with oxygen until it senses pressure  altitudes of approximately 5,000 or 10,000 feet, conserving  oxygen when it is not needed. It can also be set to N (night or  now) mode for night flying where it responds from sea-level  and up. Both modes provide the same amount of oxygen,  automatically tracking pressure altitude changes. The EDS  limits its response to a maximum respiration rate of about  20 breaths per minute, virtually eliminating hyperventilation  usually encountered in stressful situations. There are no scales  to observe or knobs to turn as you climb or descend. Adjusting  (zeroing) for new barometric pressures is not needed because  the EDS responds directly to pressure altitude, as do the  physiological properties of your body.  

# Transponder Code  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assigned  transponder code 1202 for use by gliders not in contact with  an air traffic control (ATC) facility with an effective date of  March 7, 2012.  The notice was published in JO 7110.577, a  copy of which is available on the FAA website at www.faa. gov.  Gliders operating in areas where there is an agreement  with local ATC to use a different code should contact the  agreement sponsor for guidance on which code to use.  

# Definitions  

•	 SQUAWK: The 4-digit code set in the transponder,  such as 1202. •	 IDENT or SQUAWK IDENT: A controller may  ask you to “ident” or “squawk ident” to verify your  

location on the radar screen. Do NOT push the ident  button unless they ask you to. When asked, push the  button on the transponder marked IDENT. This causes  the target on the controllers radar screen to change,  identifying your transponder location.  

•	 Tow planes are to Squawk 1200, as normal.  

# Risk Management  

Risk management, a formalized way of dealing with hazards,  is the logical process of weighing the potential costs of risks  against the possible benefits of allowing those risks to stand  uncontrolled. In order to better understand risk management,  the terms “hazard” and “risk” needs to be understood.  

Hazard identification is a process used to identify all possible  situations where people may be exposed to injury, illness, or  disease. Typical hazards are weather, mountains, obstacles,  and operational and equipment failure.  

Risk is the chance of a hazard actually causing damage  and/or injury. Risk is measured in terms of consequences  and likelihood. Risk management is the overall process  of risk identification, risk analysis, control of risks, and  risk evaluation. Risk control is part of risk management  that involves the implementation of policies, standards,  procedures, and physical changes to eliminate or minimize  adverse risks. For example, the pilot understands the risk of  a tow line break during launch. An acceptable risk that he or  she can mitigate by understanding the risk and having a plan  of actions to follow after a tow line breaks.  

# Safety Management System (SMS)  

The Safety Management System (SMS) is a formal, top-down  business approach to managing safety risk, which includes  a systemic approach to managing safety, including the  necessary organizational structures, account abilities, policies  and procedures. SMS is becoming a worldwide standard  throughout the aviation industry integrating risk management,  occupational safety, health, security, environment, and other  concepts for the management of a complete safety program.  SMS is a comprehensive program designed for a formal  organization. The individual pilot can learn from the process  and apply the concept for his or her own personal safety  considerations, such as:  

•	 Risk management decision-making. •	 Management capabilities before a system failure •	 Risk controls through safety assurance •	 Knowledge sharing between regulations and the pilot •	 Promoting a safety framework by having a sound  safety culture or attitude  

# Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)  

Aeronautical decision-making (ADM) is a mental process  used by pilots (systematically) to determine a course of action  in response to a given set of circumstances.  

•	 Circumstance: My oxygen system has a slow leak.  Soaring conditions are prefect and I do not need  oxygen for today. •	 Circumstance: High winds are forecast later today,  but I should return before the wind changes. •	 Circumstance: My batteries are low, but I am only  planning a short flight.  

Learning effective ADM skills cannot be overemphasized.  As advancement in training methods, airplane equipment  and systems, and services continue for pilots, incidents and  accidents still occur. Despite all the changes in technology  to improve flight safety, the human factor is the same.  The human factor is still involved in a high percent of all  aviation accidents.  

Circumstances as mundane as a “slow oxygen leak,” a “high  wind forecast,” or “low batteries” are parts of a decision  chain leading to an incident or accident. The term “pilot  error” has been used to describe the causes of these accidents  meaning that an action or decision made by the pilot was the  cause or a contributing factor that led to the accident. In the  previous circumstances, the chain is broken if the pilot—has  the “slow oxygen leak” repaired—respects the “high wind  forecast” and delays the flight—charges the “low batteries”  before the next flight. The pilot error definition also includes  the pilot’s failure to make a decision or take action. Human  factor-related accidents are accidents that did not involve a  single decision but a chain of decision and factors leading  to the accident. A “poor judgment chain,” referred to as the  error chain, describe the concept of contributing factors in  a human factors-related accident. Breaking one link in the  chain normally is all that is necessary to change the outcome  of the sequence of events.  

Advisory Circular (AC) 60-22, “Aeronautical Decision  Making,” provides introductory material, background  information, and reference material on ADM. The material  in this AC provides a systematic approach to risk assessment  and stress management in aviation, illustrates how personal  attitudes can influence decision-making, and how those  attitudes can be modified to enhance safety in the cockpit.  This AC also provides instructors with methods for teaching  ADM techniques and skills in conjunction with conventional  flight instruction.  

# Soaring Safety Foundation (SSF): Safety Advisory 00-1, Glider Critical Assembly  Procedures  

# Introduction  

The Soaring Society of America (SSA) and the Soaring Safety Foundation (SSF) issued Safety Advisory 00-1 concerning  glider assembly procedures to aid the pilot by providing some critical information to consider when assembling a glider.  Due to a number of recent accidents involving improper assembly of the glider as a causal factor, the SSF is issuing this  Safety Advisory to address the critical components of glider assembly. Improper glider assembly has been identified as  having caused injuries to pilots and destruction of aircraft.  

This safety advisory presents suggested procedures for ensuring proper assembly without specific detail that is available in  Pilot Operating Handbooks (POHs) and other checklists developed by the manufacturer. Other knowledgeable individuals  have also presented methods to confirm proper assembly, as well as emergency procedures for flying the aircraft should  any control function improperly due to improper assembly. The latter may or may not be approved by the manufacturer of  the glider or sailplane, and will not be discussed herein.  

# History  

Prior to 1960, most gliders required significant effort to assemble. Many had containers of bicycle chains, bolts, nuts, washers,  retaining pins, and other pieces that had to be assembled in sequence. An imporoperly assembled glider would not pass a  simple control check. For example, the horizontal tail assembly (including elevator) may not have been detached during  disassembly; the control cables for the rudder and elevator were never disconnected nor did they require assembly later.  

Later, manufacturers developed quicker and easier methods for assembling gliders and sailplanes. This made it possible to  install both wings by simply inserting the wing root into the fuselage and using a pin to secure the attachment. Horizontal  stabilizers and elevators were removed during disassembly and reassembled with as little as one simple attach bolt or pin.  The SSA and the SSF encouraged all manufacturers to go to the next level and provide “automatic hook-ups” for ailerons,  flaps, glidepath control devices, and elevators, anticipating a reduction in the potential to attempt flight without the controls  properly attached. Many of the gliders and sailplanes today have these automatic attachments.  

Although the annual numbers of reported incidents and accidents resulting from failure to attach controls have decreased,  disturbing numbers of recent incidents and accidents indicate a need for further investigation of the causes. Subsequent  structural improvements and/or revisions of assembly and/or disassembly procedures could help prevent many future  incidents and accidents.  

The SSF recognized four factors that frequently appeared when investigation of such accidents were made:  

1.	 Distractions from other people while assembling the glider, 2.	 Failure to follow manufacturer-recommended assembly procedures, 3.	 Failure to do a positive control check, and 4.	 Rushing the procedure to get into the air.  

# Ensuring Airworthiness  

The pilot in command (PIC) is directly responsible and the final authority for operation of the aircraft in accordance with Title  14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91,  section 91.3. It is also the responsibility of the PIC to determine  if the aircraft is in condition for safe flight (14 CFR part 91, section 91.7). During assembly of the glider or sailplane, the  PIC assumes that responsibility.  

During the assembly procedure, no outside interference should be allowed. It is difficult to keep observers from attempting  to converse or ask questions, but such action has frequently been the cause of incomplete and/or inaccurate assembly. The  crew person or assistant can be of great assistance by immediately deflecting this unintentional interference.  

To ensure the glider is properly assembled, the manufacturer’s checklist should be followed and positive control check  performed. The assembly should proceed in a relaxed and thorough manner and never be hurried. Rushing to squeeze in  between landings or to be number one on the grid has resulted in improperly assembled sailplanes and subsequent accidents.  To enhance the checking of the assembly process, it is suggested that the PIC ask another person to assist by examining  critical items to ensure proper installation. This person does not necessarily need to be familiar with a specific aircraft  or manufacturer, but should have a basic understanding of how to assemble a glider or sailplane. If such a person is not  available, the PIC may benefit from explaining to an assistant how each part is installed and attached; in effect, checking  the pilot’s own work.  

# Critical Items  

The following list, although not totally inclusive, offers items that should be checked prior to flight. Failure to have these  items correctly assembled may result in difficult or impossible flight characteristics. With the help of an assistant, and usually  performed by simply walking around the aircraft, starting and ending at the cockpit area, check each of the following items  as appropriate to the aircraft being flown for proper installation and security. After a thorough check of the following items  is complete, a positive control check should be conducted.  

•	 Main wing pin(s) •	 Drag spar pin(s) •	 Control rods attached •	 Ailerons, drag devices, flaps •	 Hotellier connectors •	 Spring-loaded connectors •	 Locking collars •	 Safety pins installed •	 Safety collars installed •	 Outer wing panels installed •	 Control rods attached and properly secured •	 Horizontal tail properly installed •	 Elevator control rod attached •	 Safety pin installed •	 Rudder cables attached  

The SSA and the SSF agree that adherence to this safety advisory will prevent accidents that occur as a result of improper  assembly of gliders. The SSF strongly encourages each PIC to develop a list of critical items for each glider being flown to  assist in ensuring that critical items are properly installed and secured during the assembly process.  

After the assembly is completed, the pilot should conduct a preflight as recommended by the manufacturer. This preflight  ensures that all assembly has been conducted properly, and the pilot can determine if the glider is airworthy for flight.  During the preflight, it is essential that the pilot completes a positive control check. This check ensures that the glider has  been assembled correctly and that all controls are connected and secured as per the manufacturer recommendations.  

# Glossary  

# B  

Advection.  The transport of an atmospheric variable due  to mass motion by the wind. Usually the term as used in  meteorology refers only to horizontal transport.  

Ailerons.  The hinged portion of the trailing edge of the outer  wing used to bank or roll around the longitudinal axis.  

Air density.  The mass of air per unit volume.  

Airfoil.  The surfaces on a glider that produce lift.  

Air mass.  A widespread mass of air having similar  characteristics (e.g., temperature), that usually helps to  identify the source region of the air. Fronts are distinct  boundaries between air masses.  

Amplitude.  In wave motion, one half the distance between  the wave crest and the wave trough.  

Angle of attack.  The angle formed between the relative wind  and the chord line of the wing.  

Angle of incidence.  The angle between the chord line of  the wing and the longitudinal axis of the glider. The angle  of incidence is built into the glider by the manufacturer and  cannot be adjusted by the pilot’s movements of the controls.  

Aspect ration.  The ratio between the wing span and the  mean chord of the wing.  

Asymmetrical airfoil.  One in which the upper camber differs  from the lower camber.  

Atmospheric sounding.  A measure of atmospheric variables  aloft, usually pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind.  

Atmospheric stability.  Describes a state in which an air  parcel resists vertical displacement or, once displaced (for  instance by flow over a hill), tends to return to its original  level.  

Bailout bottle.  Small oxygen cylinder connected to the  oxygen mask supplying several minutes of oxygen. It can  be used in case of primary oxygen system failure or if an  emergency bailout at high altitude became necessary.  

Ballast.  Term used to describe any system that adds weight  to the glider. Performance ballast employed in some gliders  increases wing loading using releasable water in the wings  (via integral tanks or water bags). This allows faster average  cross-country speeds. Trim ballast is used to adjust the flying  CG, often necessary for light-weight pilots. Some gliders  also have a small water ballast tank in the tail for optimizing  flying CG.  

Barograph.  Instrument for recording pressure as a function  of time. Used by glider pilots to verify flight performance  for badge or record flights.  

Best glide speed (best L/D speed).  The airspeed that results  in the least amount of altitude loss over a given distance.  This speed is determined from the performance polar. The  manufacturer publishes the best glide (L/D) airspeed for  specified weights and the resulting glide ratio. For example,  a glide ratio of 36:1 means that the glider will lose 1 foot of  altitude for every 36 feet of forward movement in still air  at this airspeed.  

# C  

Camber.  The curvature of a wing when looking at a cross  section. A wing has upper camber on its top surface and lower  camber on its bottom surface.

Centering.  Adjusting circles while thermalling to provide  the greatest average climb.  

Center of pressure.  The point along the wing chord line  where lift is considered to be concentrated.  

Centrifugal force.  The apparent force occurring in  curvilinear motion acting to deflect objects outward from the  axis of rotation. For instance, when pulling out of a dive, it  is the force pushing you down in your seat.  

Centripetal force.  The force in curvilinear motion acting  toward the axis of rotation. For instance, when pulling out  of a dive, it is the force that the seat exerts on the pilot to  offset the centrifugal force.  

Chord line.  An imaginary straight line drawn from the  leading edge of an airfoil to the trailing edge.  

Cloud streets.  Parallel rows of cumulus clouds. Each row  can be as short as 10 miles or as long as a 100 miles or more.

Convection.  Transport and mixing of an atmospheric  variable due to vertical mass motions (e.g., updrafts).  

Convective condensation level (CCL).  The level at which  cumulus forms from surface-based convection. Under this  level, the air is dry adiabatic and the mixing ratio is constant.  

Conventional tail.  A glider design with the horizontal  stabilizer mounted at the bottom of the vertical stabilizer.  

Convergence.  A net increase in the mass of air over a  specified area due to horizontal wind speed and/or direction  changes. When convergence occurs in lower levels, it is  usually associated with upward air motions.  

Convergence zone.  An area of convergence, sometimes  several miles wide, at other times very narrow. These zones  often provide organized lift for many miles (e.g., a sea-breeze  front).

Cumulus congestus.  A cumulus cloud of significant vertical  extent and usually displaying sharp edges. In warm climates,  these sometimes produce precipitation. Also called towering  cumulus, these clouds indicate that thunderstorm activity  may soon occur.  

Cumulonimbus (CB).  Also called thunderclouds, these  are deep convective clouds with a cirrus anvil and may  contain any of the characteristics of a thunderstorm: thunder,  lightning, heavy rain, hail, strong winds, turbulence, and  even tornadoes.  

Dead reckoning.  Navigation by computing a heading from  true airspeed and wind, then estimating time needed to fly  to a destination.  

Density altitude.  Pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard  temperature variations. Performance charts for many older  gliders are based on this value.  

Dewpoint (or dewpoint temperature).  The temperature  to which a sample of air must be cooled, while the amount  of water vapor and barometric pressure remain constant, in  order to attain saturation with respect to water.  

Dihedral.  The angle at which the wings are slanted upward  from the root to the tip.  

Diurnal effects.  A variation (may be in temperature,  moisture, wind, cloud cover, etc.) that recurs every 24 hours.

Dry adiabat.  A line on a thermodynamic chart representing  a rate of temperature change at the dry adiabatic lapse rate.  

Dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR).  The rate of decrease of  temperature with height of unsaturated air lifted adiabatically  (not heat exchange). Numerically the value is  $3\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or  $5.4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  per 1,000 feet.  

Cross-country.  In soaring, any flight out of gliding range  of the takeoff airfield. Note that this is different from  the definitions in the 14 CFR for meeting the experience  requirements for various pilot certificates and/or ratings.  

Dust devil.  A small vigorous circulation that can pick up dust  or other debris near the surface to form a column hundreds  or even thousands of feet deep.

# F  

Flaps.  Hinged portion of the trailing edge between the  ailerons and fuselage. In some gliders, ailerons and flaps are  interconnected to produce full-span flaperons. In either case,  flap change the lift and drag on the wing.  

Flutter.  Resonant condition leading to rapid, unstable  oscillations of part of the glider structure (e.g., the wing) or  a control surface (e.g., elevator or aileron). Flutter usually  occurs at high speeds and can quickly lead to structural  failure.  

Forward slip.  A slide used to dissipate altitude without  increasing the glider’s speed, particularly in gliders without  flaps or with inoperative spoilers.  

# G  

Glider.  A heavier-than-air aircraft that is supported in flight  by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces,  and whose free flight does not depend on an engine.  

Graupel.  Also called soft hail or snow pellets, these are  white, round or conical ice particles  $\%$   to  $\%$   inch in diameter.  They often form as a thunderstorm matures and indicate the  likelihood of lightning.  

Ground effect.  A reduction in induced drag for the same  amount of lift produced. Within one wingspan above the  ground, the decrease in induced drag enables the glider to fly  at a lower airspeed. In ground effect, a lower angle of attack  is required to produce the same amount of lift.  

# H

Human factors.  The study of how people interact with their  environments. In the case of general aviation, it is the study  of how pilot performance is influenced by such issues as the  design of cockpits, the function of the organs of the body, the  effects of emotions, and the interaction and communication  with the other participants of the aviation community, such  as other crewmembers and air traffic control personnel.  

Induced drag.  Drag that is the consequence of developing  lift with a finite-span wing. It can be represented by a vector  that results from the difference between total and vertical lift.

Lenticular cloud.  Smooth, lens-shaped clouds marking  mountain-wave crests. They may extend the entire length of  the mountain range producing the wave and are also called  wave clouds or lennies by glider pilots.  

Lift.  Produced by the dynamic effects of the airstream acting  on the wing, lift opposes the downward force of weight.  

Limit load.  The maximum load, expressed as multiples of  positive and negative G (force of gravity), that an aircraft  can sustain before structural damage becomes possible. The  load limit varies from aircraft to aircraft.  

Load factor.  The ratio of the load supported by the glider’s  wings to the actual weight of the aircraft and its contents.

# M  

Mesoscale convection system (MCS).  A large cluster of  thunderstorms with horizontal dimensions on the order of  100 miles. MCSs are sometimes organized in a long line of  thunderstorms (e.g., a squall line) or as a random grouping  of thunderstorms. Individual thunderstorms within the MCS  may be severe.  

Minimum sink airspeed.  Airspeed, as determined by the  performance polar, at which the glider achieves the lowest  sink rate. That is, the glider loses the least amount of altitude  per unit of time at minimum sink airspeed.  

Mixing ration.  The ratio of the mass of water vapor to the  mass of dry air.  

Multicell thunderstorm.  A group or cluster of individual  thunderstorm cells with varying stages of development.  These storms are often self propagating and may last for  several hours.

Parasite drag.  Drag caused by any aircraft surface that  deflects or interferes with the smooth airflow around the  airplane.  

Pilotage.  Navigational technique based on flight by reference  to ground landmarks.  

Pilot-induced oscillation (PIO).  Rapid oscillations caused  by the pilot’s overcontrolled motions. PIOs usually occur on  takeoff or landings with pitch-sensitive gliders and in severe  cases can lead to loss of control or damage.  

Pitch attitude.  The angle of the longitudinal axis relative to  the horizon. Pitch attitude serves as a visual reference for the  pilot to maintain or change airspeed.  

Pitot-static system.  System that powers the airspeed altimeter  and variometer by relying on air pressure differences to  measure glider speed, altitude, and climb or sink rate.  

Placards.  Small statements or pictorial signs permanently  fixed in the cockpit and visible to the pilot. Placards are used  for operating limitations (e.g., weight or speeds) or to indicate  the position of an operating lever (e.g., landing gear retracted  or down and locked).

Rate of turn.  The amount of time it takes for a glider to turn  a specified number of degrees.  

Relative wind.  The airflow caused by the motion of the  aircraft through the air. Relative wind, also called relative  airflow, is opposite and parallel to the direction of flight.  

Rotor.  A turbulent circulation under mountain-wave crests,  to the lee side and parallel to the mountains creating the wave.  Glider pilots use the term rotor to describe any low-level  turbulent flow associated with mountain waves.  

Rotor streaming.  A phenomenon that occurs when the air  flow at mountain levels may be sufficient for wave formation,  but begins to decrease with altitude above the mountain. In  this case, the air downstream of the mountain breaks up and  becomes turbulent, similar to rotor, with no lee waves above.  

Rudder.  Attached to the back of the vertical stabilizer, the  rudder controls movement about the vertical axis.  

Sailplane.  A glider used for traveling long distances and  remaining aloft for extended periods of time.

Side slip.  A slip in which the glider’s longitudinal axis  remains parallel to the original flightpath but in which the  flightpath changes direction according to the steepness of  the bank.  

Slip.  A descent with one wing lowered and the glider’s  longitudinal axis at an angle to the flightpath. A slip is  used to steepen the approach path without increasing the  airspeed, or to make the glider move sideways through the  air, counteracting the drift resulting from a crosswind.  

Speed to fly.  Optimum speed through the (sinking or rising)  air mass to achieve either the furthest glide or fastest average  cross-country speed depending on the objectives during a  flight.  

Spin.  An aggravated stall that results in the glider descending  in a helical, or corkscrew, path.  

Spoilers.  Devices on the tops of wings to disturb (spoil) part  of the airflow over the wing. The resulting decrease in lift  creates a higher sink rate and allows for a steeper approach.  

Squall line.  A line of thunderstorms often located along  or ahead of a vigorous cold front. Squall lines may contain  severe thunderstorms. The term is also used to describe a  line of heavy precipitation with an abrupt wind shift but  no thunderstorms, as sometimes occurs in association with  fronts.  

Stabilator.  A one-piece horizontal stabilizer used in lieu of  an elevator.  

Stability.  The glider’s ability to maintain a uniform flight  condition and return to that condition after being disturbed.  

Stall.  Condition that occurs when the critical angle of attack  is reached and exceeded. Airflow begins to separate from the  top of the wing, leading to a loss of lift. A stall can occur at  any pitch attitude or airspeed.  

Standard atmosphere.  A theoretical vertical distribution  of pressure, temperature and density agreed upon by  international convention. It is the standard used, for instance,  for aircraft performance calculations. At sea level, the  standard atmosphere consists of a barometric pressure of  29.92 inches of mercury   $(^{\mathrm{"Hg}})$   or 1013.2 millibars, and a  temperature of   $15\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(59\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  . Pressure and temperature  normally decrease as altitude increases. The standard lapse  rate in the lower atmosphere for each 1,000 feet of altitude  is approximately   $1\,^{"}\mathrm{Hg}$  . and  $2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $3.5\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ). For example, the  standard pressure and temperature at 3,000 feet mean sea  level (MSL) is  $26.92\:"\mathrm{Hg}$  . (29.92 – 3) and  $9\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $(15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}-6\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  .  

Static stability.  The initial tendency to return to a state of  equilibrium when disturbed from that state.  

Supercell thunderstorm.  A large, powerful type of  thunderstorm that forms in very unstable environments with  vertical and horizontal wind shear. These are almost always  associated with severe weather, strong surface winds, large  hail, and/or tornadoes.  

T-tail.  A type of glider with the horizontal stabilizer mounted  on the top of the vertical stabilizer forming a T.  

Thermal.  A buoyant plume or bubble of rising air.  

Thermal index (TI).  For any given level is the temperature  of the air parcel having risen at the dry adiabatic lapse  rate (DALR) subtracted from the ambient temperature.  Experience has shown that a TI should be  $^{-2}$   for thermals to  form and be sufficiently strong for soaring flight.  

Thermal wave.  Waves, often but not always marked by cloud  streets, that are excited by convection disturbing an overlying  stable layer. Also called convection waves.  

Thermodynamic diagram.  A chart presenting isopleths of  pressure, temperature, water vapor content, as well as dry and  saturated adiabats. Various forms exist, the most commonly  used in the United States being the Skew-T/Log-P.  

Thrust.  The forward force that propels a powered glider  through the air.  

Total drag.  The sum of parasite and induced drag.  

Towhook.  A mechanism allowing the attachment and release  of a towrope on the glider or towplane. On gliders, it is located  near the nose or directly ahead of the main wheel. Two types  oftowhooks commonly used in gliders are manufactured by  Tost and Schweizer.  

Trim devices.  Any device designed to reduce or eliminate  pressure on the control stick. When properly trimmed, the  glider should fly at the desired airspeed with no control  pressure from the pilot (i.e., hands off). Trim mechanisms  are either external tabs on the elevator (or stabilator) or a  simple spring-tension system connected to the control stick.  

V V-tail.  A type of glider with two tail surfaces mounted to  form a V. V-tails combine elevator and rudder movements.  

Variometer.  Sensitive rate of climb or descent indicator  that measures static pressure between the static ports and  an external capacity. Variometers can be mechanical or  electrical and can be compensated to eliminate unrealistic  indications of lift and sink due to rapid speed changes.  

Vertical axis.  An imaginary straight line drawn through  the center of gravity and perpendicular to the lateral and  longitudinal axes. Yaw movement occurs around the vertical  axis and is controlled by the rudder.  

Visual meteorological conditions (VMC).  Meteorological  conditions expressed in terms of visibility, distance from  cloud, and ceiling equal to or better than a specified minimum.  VMC represents minimum conditions for safe flight using  visual reference for navigation and traffic separation.  Ceilings and visibility below VMC constitutes instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC).  

# W
