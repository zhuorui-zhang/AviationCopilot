# Powered Parachute  Flying Handbook  

# 2007  

# Preface  

The  Powered Parachute Flying Handbook  is designed as a technical manual for applicants who are preparing  for a powered parachute category rating and for currently certificated powered parachute pilots who wish to  improve their knowledge. Certificated flight instructors will find this handbook a valuable training aid, since  detailed coverage of emergency procedures, components and systems, aerodynamics, powerplants, ground op­ erations, flight maneuvers, airport operations, and aeronautical decision making is included. Topics, such as  navigation and communication, use of flight information publications, and regulations are available in other  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications.  

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the FAA. There are different  ways of teaching, as well as performing flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations in the explana­ tions of aerodynamic theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept of flying  powered parachutes. The discussion and explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles.  Occasionally the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use  of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to also become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of  14 CFR, the  Aeronautical Information Manual  (AIM), and the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25), all of which are available online at  www.faa.gov . Performance standards for demonstrating  competence required for pilot certification are prescribed in the appropriate powered parachute practical test  standard (PTS).  

The current Flight Standards Service airman training and testing material and subject matter knowledge codes  for all airman certificates and ratings can be obtained from the FAA web site  www.faa.gov .  

The FAA greatly acknowledges the valuable assistance provided by many individuals and organizations through­ out the aviation community whose expertise contributed to the preparation of this handbook.

# History of the Powered Parachute  

As early as the 12th century, the Chinese used an um­ brella-shape parachute design for recreation. About  300 years later, Leonardo da Vinci blueprinted a pyra­ mid-shaped parachute. In the late 18th century, man  jumped from towers and balloons with a parachute.  The first parachute jump from an airplane occurred  in 1912.  

After World War II, sport jumping became a recre­ ational activity. The sport started with round para­ chutes, ranging in size from 20 to 30 feet in diameter.  Parachutes evolved into a steerable, gliding wing  smaller than today’s rectangular ram-air powered  parachute (PPC) wing which is approximately 38 feet  wide.  

On October 1, 1964, Domina C. Jalbert applied for  a patent for his “Multi-Cell Wing” named “Parafoil”  (also known as a “ram-air” wing), which was a new  parachute design. His ideas were registered as a U.S.  patent on November 15,1966. [Figure 1-1 A] Howev­ er, in 1964 Lowell Farrand had already flown a motor­ ized version called “The Irish Flyer” by Nicolaides.  [Figure 1-1 B] Farrand was the first person to put an  engine on a ram-air inflated parachute wing, starting  the evolution of the powered parachute with the Irish  Flyer. This wing evolved into today’s modern pow­ ered parachute canopies, which include rectangular,  elliptical, semi-elliptical, and hybrid wings.  

The United States (U.S.) government had a number  of test programs that used the square parachute as a  means to glide spacecraft back to earth or glide pay­ loads dropped out of airplanes to a specific location.  

Two-place powered parachutes have years of testing,  development, and evolution. Training exemptions to  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 103, Ultralight Vehicles, permitted individuals  to give instruction in two-place ultralight vehicles,  instead of being restricted to vehicles intended for  single occupants. [Figure 1-1 C] The Federal Avia­ tion Administration (FAA) allowed ultralight vehicle

pilots to train in two-place ultralights until January  31, 2008. After this date, the ultralight vehicle train­ ing exemption expires and only N-numbered aircraft  may be used in two-place PPC instruction and flight.  [Figure 1-1 D]  

# Powered Parachute Terms  

Different terms have been used throughout the pow­ ered parachute community. [Figure 1-2] The terms  standardized throughout this book are as follows:  

•	 Powered Parachute – The complete aircraft. •	 Cart – The engine and seats, attached by a  structure to wheels; may also be referred to as  the fuselage, cockpit, chaise, or airframe. •	 Wing – Typically a ram-air inflated and  pressurized wing including lines that attach to  the cart. The wing is not in position to fly until  the aircraft is in motion; when not inflated,  referred to as a parachute or chute.  

# Introduction to the Powered  Parachute  

The powered parachute is a category of aircraft that  flies in a manner unique among light-sport aircraft.  Three significant differences separate the PPC from  other types of light sport aircraft (LSA): [Figure 1-3]  

1.	The wing must be inflated and pressurized by  ram air prior to each takeoff.

 	 2.	The aircraft uses a pendulum configuration,  where the cart hangs about 20 feet below the  wing, connected via flexible suspension lines.

 	 3.	The wing is at a relatively fixed angle with the  suspension lines and flies at a relatively constant  speed. Other aircraft categories allow pilots to  change the speed of the aircraft, but the powered  parachute airspeed remains within a very small  range.  

A powered parachute can be a single place ultralight  flying vehicle, a single place light-sport aircraft, or  a multi-place light-sport aircraft. The common ac­ ronyms for this vehicle/aircraft are PPC (powered  parachute), PPCL (powered parachute land) or PPCS  (powered parachute sea).  

A light-sport aircraft PPC used for sport and private  flying must be registered with an FAA N-number,  have an airworthiness certificate, a pilot’s operating  handbook (POH), and/or limitations with a weight  and balance document aboard. The aircraft must be  maintained properly by the aircraft owner or other  qualified personnel and have the aircraft logbooks  available for inspection. Dual controls are required in  the aircraft for training.  

# Powered Parachute Pilot Certificate  Eligibility Requirements  

You may not act as pilot in command (PIC) of a light-  sport aircraft powered parachute unless you hold  a pilot certificate with a powered parachute rating  issued by the FAA. At this time the only pilot cer­Figure 1-2. Two-place powered parachute aircraft.

tificates with powered parachute ratings are Student,  Sport and Private. The FAA is empowered by the U.S.  Congress to promote aviation safety by prescribing  safety standards for pilots and the other civil aviation  programs. The Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs),  formerly referred to as Federal Aviation Regulations  (FARs), are one of the primary means of conveying  these safety standards.  

Title 14 CFR, part 61 specifies the requirements to  earn a pilot certificate. This regulation also states the  pilot applicant must be able to read, speak, write, and  understand the English language. The FAA Practical  Test Standards (PTS) establish the standards for the  knowledge and skills necessary for the issuance of  a pilot certificate. [Figure 1-4] You should reference  both these documents to understand the knowledge,  skills and experience required to obtain a pilot certifi­ cate to fly a powered parachute.  

![](images/d7591729ab3b1625a940d7b8242d4f6d080b6aed13e14c30bc8183415ba5ddde.jpg)  
Figure 1-4. The PTS is used to test the knowledge and skill  of a pilot applicant.Sport Pilot PTS cover.Table 1. Definitions with respect to the certification, ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen.  

Pilot applicants must have a valid U.S. driver’s license  or a current third-class medical certificate issued un­ der 14 CFR part 67. If you use your valid driver’s  license to exercise the privileges of a Sport Pilot cer­ tificate, then you must also adhere to any restrictions  on that driver’s license. You must hold a current third- class medical certificate to exercise the privileges of a  Private Pilot certificate.  

The process of learning to fly includes a combination  of ground training (to include successful completion  of the FAA Knowledge Exam) and flight training to  include dual flights with a certified flight instructor  (CFI), as well as solo flights under the supervision of  your CFI.  

To be eligible to fly solo in a PPC, you must be at  least 16 years of age and demonstrate satisfactory  aeronautical knowledge on a test developed by your  instructor. You must have received and logged flight  training for the maneuvers and procedures in 14 CFR  part 61 for the PPC, as well as demonstrated satis­ factory proficiency and safety. Only after all of these  requirements are met can your instructor endorse your  student pilot certificate and logbook for solo flight.  

Once you obtain the required aeronautical knowledge  and experience required by 14 CFR part 61, your flight  instructor will endorse you to take a practical test (of­ ten called a “checkride”) with a sport pilot examiner  (SPE) or an FAA inspector. After you’ve demonstrat­ ed satisfactory aeronautical knowledge and skill in  the Areas of Operation and Tasks outlined in the PTS,  this examiner or inspector will issue your temporary  (paper) pilot certificate. You will receive a plastic cer­ tificate in the mail once the results of the practical test  are received by the FAA Registration branch.  

A sport pilot is certified to fly a light-sport aircraft. To  be eligible for a sport pilot certificate with a powered  parachute rating, you must be at least 17 years of age,  complete the specific training and flight time require­ ments described in 14 CFR part 61 subpart J, pass the  FAA Knowledge Exam, and successfully complete  the practical test.  

If you hold at least a private pilot certificate, but not  a rating for the category and class of PPC LSA, you  can operate the powered parachute with a logbook  endorsement and passing a proficiency check. [Table  1] If you hold at least a private pilot certificate with  a PPC category and class rating, and have a current  

![](images/7742aa58cb9effae70f8f04880f16f4b166768405af695767705f4a66e5b010b.jpg)  

# Table 1. Definitions with respect to the certification,  ratings, privileges, and limitations of airmen.  

third-class medical, then you may operate any PPC  LSA in that category and class, and do not need to  hold any of the endorsements required by Sport Pi­ lots, nor do you need to comply with the limitations  of a Sport Pilot certificate.  

Note: If you hold at least a Private pilot certificate, but  not a medical certificate, you may operate as a Sport  Pilot and must comply with 14 CFR part 61 subpart J.  

A Sport Pilot instructor can instruct, endorse logbooks  for privileges, and give proficiency check flights in a  LSA. To be eligible for a Sport Pilot instructor cer­ tificate, you must be at least 18 years of age and hold  at least a current and valid Sport Pilot certificate with  category and class ratings or endorsements appropri­ ate to the flight instructor privileges sought. You must  also pass the Sport Pilot instructor and fundamentals  of instructing knowledge exams and meet the experi­ ence and knowledge requirements outlined in 14 CFR  part 61.  

# Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM)  

Your current attitude or mindset is something you, as  PIC, must constantly be alert to in order to maintain  your safety and that of the aircraft, your passenger and  the general public on the ground. To accomplish sound  aeronautical decision making (ADM), you must first  be aware of your limitations and well-being (physical  and psychological health), even before beginning the  first preflight routine. While technology is constantly  improving equipment and strengthening materials,  safe flight comes down to the decisions made by the  human pilot prior to and during flight.  

The well-being of the pilot is the starting point for  the decision making processes that will occur while  in control of the aircraft. Just as physical fatigue and  illness will directly affect your judgment, so too will  your attitude management, stress management, risk  management, personality tendencies, and situational  awareness. Hence, it is the awareness of your human  factors and the knowledge of the related corrective  action that will not only improve the safety of operat­ ing a powered parachute, but will also enhance the joy  of flying. See Chapter 16 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25) to learn  the decision-making process, risk management tech­ niques, and hazardous attitude antidotes you should  use in all your flight operations.  

ly, it is not a single decision or indecision that leads  to an accident, but most likely it is a chain of error-
 related factors. This inadequate action and poor judg­ ment path is referred to as the human “error chain.”  You only need to be aware of a situation and break  one link in this error chain to improve the outcome  of a sequence of events and return to safe and secure  flight.  

A good instructor will immediately begin teaching  ADM when the student has the ability to confidently  control the powered parachute during the most basic  maneuvers. During a proficiency or practical test, the  instructor or examiner will be evaluating the appli­ cant’s ability to use satisfactory ADM practices as  the pilot determines risks and coordinates safe pro­ cedures.  

# Resource Management  

Pilots must make effective use of single-pilot resource  management (SRM): human resources (pilot, passen­ ger, maintenance personnel, and the weather briefer,  as applicable), hardware (equipment), and informa­ tion. It is similar to crew resource management (CRM)  procedures that are being emphasized in multi-crew­ member operations except only one crewmember (the  pilot) is involved. Resource management is one way  of optimizing the risk elements (the pilot, the aircraft,  the environment, and the type of flight operation).  This ability to manage the resources available to you  is as critical to the successful outcome of the flight as  your skills and procedures as a pilot.  

Light-sport aircraft are flown by a single pilot. None­ theless, there are numerous resources available to that  pilot. For instance, even though the passenger is not  a pilot, he or she can be asked to assist with scanning  the skies and a possible landing location during an  emergency. Your knowledge, skills, and consistent use  of a checklist are also valuable resources. External re­ sources for the powered parachute pilot include those  that can assist with Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs)  and weather information. These resources can include  Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), Au­ tomated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Hazard­ ous Inflight Weather Advisory Service (HIWAS), and  Flight Service Stations (FSS) 800-WX-BRIEF.  

The phrase “pilot error” points to the human factors  which have caused an incident or accident, including  the pilot’s failure to take appropriate action. Typical­  

# Use of Checklists  

Checklists have been the foundation of pilot standard­ ization and cockpit safety for many years. The check­ list is an aid to the fallible human memory and helps  to ensure that critical safety items are not overlooked  or forgotten. However, checklists are of no value if  the pilot is not committed to their use. Without dis­ cipline and dedication in using a checklist, the odds  favor the possibility of an error.  

The importance of consistent use of checklists cannot  be overstated in pilot training. A major objective in  primary flight training is to establish habitual patterns  that will serve the pilot well throughout their entire  flying career. The flight instructor must promote a  positive attitude toward the use of checklists, and the  student pilot must realize its importance. At a mini­ mum, prepared checklists should be referenced for  the following phases of flight:  

•	 Preflight Inspection •	 Before Engine Start •	 Engine Starting •	 Before Kiting and Taxiing the Wing •	 During the Takeoff Roll •	 After Takeoff •	 Before Landing •	 After Landing •	 Engine Shutdown •	 Postflight Inspection and Securing  

Due to the open nature of the cart, you should secure  your checklist to ensure it does not get blown through  the prop. It should be attached to something (a knee­ board strapped to your leg, the instrument panel, etc.)  to eliminate the possibility of it being blown away, yet  remaining visible and easy to use.  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is the accurate perception and  understanding of all the factors that affect the pow­ ered parachute, pilot, passenger, environment and  type of operation comprising a given situation. Main­ taining situational awareness requires an understand­ ing of the relative significance of these factors and  their future impact on the flight. When situationally  aware, the pilot has an overview of the total operation  and is not fixated on one perceived significant factor.  In addition, an awareness must be maintained of the  environmental conditions of the flight, such as spatial  orientation of the PPC, and its relationship to terrain,  traffic, weather, and airspace.  

To maintain situational awareness, all of the skills in­ volved in aeronautical decision making are used. For  example, an accurate perception of pilot fitness can  be achieved through self-assessment and recognition  of hazardous attitudes. Establishing a productive rela­ tionship with pattern traffic and traffic control can be  accomplished by effective resource use.  

# Stress Management  

Stress is part of the human process. A certain amount  of stress can be good as it keeps a person alert and  tends to prevent complacency. However, the effects  of stress are cumulative. If not coped with adequately,  eventually the stress may result in an intolerable bur­ den with negative psychological and perhaps physical  consequences. Performance generally increases with  the onset of stress, peaks, and then begins to fall off  rapidly as stress levels exceed a person’s ability to  cope. The ability to make effective decisions during  flight is likely to be impaired by stress. Hence, the  ability to reduce high levels of cockpit stress will have  a direct correlation to aircraft safety.  

Stress management in the aircraft begins by making  an assessment of stress in all areas of your life. There  are several techniques to help manage the accumu­ lation of life stresses and prevent stress overload.  For example: set realistic goals; manage time more  effectively; include relaxation time in a busy sched­ ule; maintain a weekly program of physical fitness;  and maintain flight proficiency. If stress does strike  in flight, you should try to relax, take a deep breath,  and then calmly begin to think rationally through the  resolution and decision process.  

# Medical Factors Related to the PPC  

Medical factors, regardless of their severity, should  never be dismissed without at least a cursory consid­ eration. Even a toothache or the common cold can be  detrimental to a safe flight, especially when drugs of  any sort, even non-prescription, are taken before the  flight.  

Most medical issues can be easily handled in a PPC,  but a few can have severe influences on the safety  of the flight. For instance, medical situations might  cause the muscles of the limbs to tighten or go into a  spasm. These scenarios can be deadly, such as when  the legs are pressing against a steering bar during a  seizure.  

The following medical factors are not listed by impor­ tance, but by alphabetical order for easy reference.  

# Dehydration  

Alcohol directly affects the brain and can do so very  quickly. Some myths still surround alcohol: drink­ ing coffee can dissipate the effects, or taking a cold  shower will “sober” you up quickly. The fact is that  becoming intoxicated is determined by the amount of  alcohol in the bloodstream. Once consumed, alcohol  can enter the bloodstream—and therefore the brain— in as quickly as 10 minutes. Once in the brain, motor  skills immediately begin to deteriorate. The com­ mon aviation saying is   $^{\circ}8$   hours bottle to throttle.”  However, depending on the metabolism of the indi­ vidual, it may be twice as long before some humans  can dissipate the negative effects of alcohol. Even in  small amounts, alcohol can affect your motor skills,  diminish your mental reasoning, decrease your sense  of responsibility, and shorten your memory. In addi­ tion, the effect of alcohol is greatly multiplied when  gaining altitude.  

FAA regulations state that no one may act as a crew­ member if they have consumed alcohol within 8 hours  of flight, are under the influence of alcohol, are using  any drug affecting their faculties contrary to safety,  or if they have a blood alcohol level greater than 0.04  percent. Part 61 also states that refusal to take a drug  or alcohol test, a conviction for a violation of any  Federal or State statute relating to the operation of  a motor vehicle (that’s right—a car) while under the  influence of alcohol or a drug, or failure to provide a  written report of each motor vehicle action to the FAA  (not later than 60 days after the motor vehicle action)  are grounds for:  

1.	Denial of an application for any certificate,  rating, or authorization for a period of up to 1  year after the date of such refusal; or

 	 2.	Suspension or revocation of any certificate,  rating, or authorization.  

# Anxiety  

Anxiety can cause humans to act in unpredictable and  negative ways. If your future is uncertain or an unpre­ dictable event occurs that forces you into an unknown  path, anxiety can appear. Self realization and learned  confidence through knowledge and practice are the  best ways to prepare for possible anxiety attacks.  

# Carbon Monoxide Poisoning  

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is typically not a  factor in a powered parachute, as the engine is be­ hind the pilot in the typical PPC pusher configura­ tion. However, since CO is a colorless, odorless, and  tasteless gas, you need to be alert to exposure prior  to flight.  

Dehydration is the critical loss of water from the body.  The first noticeable effect of dehydration is fatigue. A  powered parachute pilot is particularly susceptible to  dehydration, as they normally fly in an open cart, of­ ten exposed for hours to the direct rays of the sun. If  dehydration occurs and water is not replaced, fatigue  will progress to dizziness, weakness, nausea, tingling  of hands and feet, abdominal cramps, and extreme  thirst. It is highly recommended for PPC pilots, espe­ cially those that fly in desert regions, to carry an am­ ple supply of water and to drink regularly, regardless  of whether or not you feel thirsty. When you begin to  feel thirsty, the beginning stages of dehydration have  already started.  

# Drugs  

One of the biggest misconceptions is the myth that  over-the-counter drugs may be taken before a flight.  A non-prescription drug does not mean it is free of  side effects that may affect your faculties. Consult a  physician about mixing flying with any drugs. Many  medications such as tranquilizers, sedatives, strong  pain relievers, and cough-suppressants have primary  effects that may impair judgment, memory, alertness,  coordination, vision, and the ability to make calcula­ tions. Others, such as antihistamines, blood pressure  drugs, muscle relaxants, and agents to control diar­ rhea and motion sickness, have side effects that may  impair the same critical functions.  

Pain killers or over-the-counter analgesics, such as  Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), Tylenol (acetamino­ phen), and Advil (ibuprofen), have few side effects  when taken in the correct dosage. Flying is usually  not restricted when taking these drugs. However, fly­ ing is almost always precluded while using prescrip­ tion analgesics such as Darvon, Percodan, Demerol,  and codeine, since these drugs may cause side effects  such as mental confusion, dizziness, headaches, nau­ sea, and vision problems.  

Regulations prohibit pilots from performing duties  while using any medication that affects their abilities  in any way contrary to safety. The safest rule is not to  fly while taking any medication, unless approved to  do so by an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME).  

# Middle Ear and Sinus Problems  

As powered parachutes are not pressurized, atmo­ spheric pressure changes will affect pilots flying to  high altitudes. Atmospheric pressure decreases as you  ascend, and increases as you descend. The pilot’s in­ ner ear does not always have a means to adjust its  contained air pressure to the outside or ambient air  pressure. When the pressure in the inner ear is any­ thing different than the outside air pressure, the result  can be pain as the eardrum bulges outward or inward  in reaction to the pressure differential.  

To resolve this condition you need to equalize the  pressure via the eustachian tube that leads from the  middle ear to your mouth. One method of doing this  is to pinch your nostrils shut, close your mouth and  lips, and blow slowly and gently in the mouth and  nose. This procedure forces air up the eustachian tube  into the middle ear. If you have a cold, an ear infec­ tion, or sore throat, you may not be able to equalize  the pressure in your ears. A flight in this condition  can be extremely painful, as well as damaging to your  eardrums. Hence, flying is not recommended if you  have an illness with symptoms around the ears, nose  or mouth.  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is frequently associated with pilot error. Many  pilots do not want to readily admit that fatigue could  be a detrimental factor to their flight skills. Some of  the effects of fatigue include degradation of attention,  degradation of concentration, impaired coordination,  and decreased ability to communicate. These factors  can seriously influence a pilot’s ability to make effec­ tive decisions.  

Whether you experience physical fatigue from a lack  of sleep or physical work, or mental fatigue from  stress, you should consider staying grounded.  

# Hyperventilation  

Hyperventilation occurs when you are experiencing  emotional stress, fright, or pain, and your breathing  rate and depth increase although the carbon dioxide   $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$   is already at a reduced level in the blood. The  result is an excessive loss of carbon dioxide from your  body, which can lead to unconsciousness due to the  respiratory system’s overriding mechanism to regain  breathing control.  

The typical symptoms need to be recognized and  should not be confused with hypoxia, which shares  some indicators. Lightheadedness, feelings of suffo­ cation, and drowsiness can be some of the first signs.  Hyperventilation may produce a pale, clammy ap­ pearance and muscle spasms compared to the cya­ nosis and limp muscles associated with hypoxia. As  hyperventilation progresses, you may then feel tin­ gling in the extremities, then muscle cramps; cramps  that can be become severe and painful. If you don’t  correct your breathing, your brain will override your  consciousness, and cause you to faint, while the brain  regains control of your breathing.  

Hyperventilation can occur when a pilot feels an  excessive amount of stress, fear or anxiety. An un­ expected or extreme encounter with a thermal or tur­ bulence may unconsciously increase your breathing  rate. These situations and the associated feelings tend  to increase the rate and size of breath, which then re­ sults in clearing too much  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   from the body.  

The solution is to relax and slow down your breathing.  This can be accomplished by talking or singing out  loud, or breathing into a paper bag which keeps fresh  oxygenated air from further reducing the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   in your  system. Symptoms will rapidly subside after the rate  and depth of breathing are brought under control.  

# Hypoxia  

Hypoxia is a lack of oxygen. There are many forms of  hypoxia that are beyond the scope and need for dis­ cussion in a PPC manual, but the results from oxygen  deficiency are the impairment of the functions of the  brain and other organs. Symptoms include headache,  drowsiness, dizziness, euphoria, and blue fingernails  and lips.  

The most likely cause for a PPC pilot to experience  symptoms of hypoxia would be flying too high. Un­ less you are a private pilot with a powered parachute  rating, you need to stay below 10,000 feet where you  will have less chance of experiencing hypoxia in a  PPC. However, if you are acclimated to sea level con­ ditions and climb above 8,000 feet, you may feel the  effects of hypoxia. The longer you stay at altitude,  the greater the effects of hypoxia will be. In addition,  recent consumption of alcohol, smoking, and some  medications will render a pilot more susceptible to  disorientation and hypoxia. If you question your con­ dition and consider hypoxia to be a potential problem,  you should fly at lower altitudes and/or use supple­ mental oxygen.  

# Motion Sickness  

Motion sickness, or airsickness, is caused by the brain  receiving conflicting messages about the orientation  of the body. The inner ear—specifically the vestibular  system—is reporting one spatial orientation, and the  eyes are communicating a different scenario. This not  only causes confusion in your thinking, it may pos­ sibly create vertigo or spatial disorientation. It often  causes vomiting and a debilitating feeling. Vomiting  is due to a nerve that is connected from the brain to the  stomach. When confusion or disagreement occurs be­ tween the eyes and the orientating vestibular system,  vomiting may erupt.  

When symptoms of motion sickness begin, get back  on the ground. In the meantime, avoid unnecessary  head movements and keep your eyes on the horizon.  

As the pilot, you should note if the passenger, who  had been talking throughout the flight, gets quiet. You  should ask “how are you doing” because getting quiet  is sometimes a precursor to feelings of nausea. Inform  passengers while still on the ground to let you know  if their stomach begins to feel “uneasy.”  

Motion sickness can be the result of continued flight  stimulation, such as rapid or unexpected turns and  swinging through the PPC pendulum. As the pilot, you  will find a reduced rate of upset stomachs if you let the  passenger know, ahead of time, the flight maneuver  you are about to make and avoid abrupt maneuvers.  

For new students, anxiety and stress may greatly con­ tribute to motion sickness. However, after a few les­ sons and some time in the air from the front seat, these  feelings/symptoms will usually dissipate.  

Medication like Dramamine can be used to prevent  motion sickness/nausea in passengers, but since it  can cause drowsiness, it is not recommended for the  pilot.  

# Scuba Diving  

Taking a flight, especially a high flight, after a deep  scuba dive can have some devastating results. This is  because the increased pressure of the water during a  dive causes nitrogen to be absorbed into the body tis­ sues and bloodstream. Then, when flying at altitudes  of reduced atmospheric pressure, the nitrogen will  move out of the bloodstream and tissues at a rapid  rate. This rapid out-gassing of nitrogen is called the  bends (as it is felt in the joints—the bending joints of  the limbs) and is painful and incapacitating.  

A pilot or passenger who intends to fly after scuba  diving should allow the body sufficient time to rid it­ self of excess nitrogen that was absorbed during the  dive. If the appropriate amount of time is not allowed,  decompression sickness due to gases released in the  blood can result in a serious in-flight emergency.  

As an absolute standard safety measure, any pilot fly­ ing near a large body of water should ask the passen­ ger during the preflight if he or she has recently been  scuba diving.  

![The following waiting times are recommended: ](images/50057e873eef6eb54a0fe4f6689cab990eb8633bb5d5512a9929982ca810a210.jpg)  

# Spatial Disorientation  

Spatial disorientation is not normally associated with  slow and low (non-aerobatic) powered parachute  flights. However, it is important to know that spatial  disorientation is a condition of the body’s confusion  relative to the spatial position. This commonly results  from the eyes disagreeing with the sense of balance  (the vestibular system of the inner ear) which may  be disagreeing with the postural nerve impulses from  the pressure areas in the skin and muscles. Hence, the  brain gets conflicting spatial information. This condi­ tion is sometimes called vertigo.  

The recommended procedure to deal with spatial dis­ orientation is to maintain constant, straight and level  flight via the throttle and remove all control input to  the steering controls.  

# Stress  

Stress is a strong factor in pilot error. Stressful situ­ ations are very disruptive conditions. There are three  categories of stress: environment (physical, such as  loud noises), psychological (the loss of a loved one)  and physiological (fatigue). Any of these factors can  be influential on your mental capacities, and hence  should be given consideration when begining your  medical self-evaluation prior to preflight inspection.  Any pilot experiencing a high level of stress is not  safe and should not fly as PIC.  

# Stroke and Heart Attack  

In the event you feel light-headed or dizzy, you  should remove your feet from an input position on  the steering controls. When you feel light-headed or  dizzy, there is a possibility this could be a prelude to  a heart attack or stroke. If you are about to experience  a medical problem of this magnitude, then you could  have a seizure or leg spasms (due to the pain from the  heart attack) and therefore, uncontrollably and with­ out intention, spiral yourself into the ground if the leg  spasm induces severe steering input.  

If you don’t feel “right”— pull your feet away from  those steering controls, at least until you begin to feel  better, and then get yourself safely on the ground as  soon as possible.  

# Medical Summary­— “The Bottom Line”  

Before even approaching the PPC, you must take a  moment to reflect upon your current medical, physi­ cal, and psychological condition. It is in this reflective  moment that you should begin to evaluate your ability  to safely conduct the flight. Once satisfied with your  self-evaluation, the preflight inspection can then con­ tinue. Using the “I’M SAFE” checklist is a smart way  to start your preflight before getting to the powered  parachute. Prior to flight, assess your fitness as well  as the aircraft’s airworthiness. [Figure 1-5]I'm SAFE Checklist.

Chapters 2 and 3 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronau­ tical Knowledge  (FAA-H-8083-25) apply to powered  parachutes and are a prerequisite to reading this book.  This chapter will focus on the aerodynamic fundamen­ tals unique to powered parachute (PPC) operations.  

# Aerodynamic Terms  

Airfoil  is the term used for surfaces on a powered  parachute that produce lift, typically the wing itself.  Although many different airfoil designs exist, all air­ foils produce lift in a similar manner.  

Camber  refers to the curvature of a wing when look­ ing at a cross section. A wing possesses  upper cam­ ber  on its top surface and  lower camber  on its bottom  surface.  Leading edge  describes the forward edge of  the airfoil. The rear edge of the airfoil is called the  trailing edge . The  chord line  is an imaginary straight  line drawn from the leading edge to the trailing edge.  [Figure 2-1]  

![](images/7b41d773433931b940d2e85d1418b8489c2a56ad6d44a47a0a99ea6a87f7b8fd.jpg)  
Figure 2-1. Aerodynamic terms of an airfoil.  

Relative wind  is the direction of the airflow with re­ spect to the wing; it is usually parallel to and opposite  the PPC  flight path . Relative wind may be affected  by movement of the PPC through the air, as well as by  all forms of unstable, disturbed air such as wind shear,  thermals, turbulence, and mountain rotors. When a  PPC is flying through undisturbed air, the relative  wind is parallel to and opposite the flight path.  

Angle of attack  is the angle between the relative wind  and the wing chord line. [Figure 2-2]  

Longitudinal axis  is an imaginary line about which  the aircraft rolls; it is also called the roll axis. The  longitudinal axis is not a fixed line through the cart  because the angle of incidence changes in turbulence  and with loading changes.  

Angle of incidence  is the angle formed by the chord  line of the wing and the longitudinal axis of the PPC  cart. The cart longitudinal axis is not the same as the  aerodynamic longitudinal axis defined in the previous  paragraph. [Figure 2-2] Unlike an airplane, the angle  of incidence can change in flight because of the flex­ ible line attachment between the wing and the cart.  Angle of incidence can change for different types of  flight configurations and PPC designs; this is covered  in detail in the “Moments” section.  

Trim angle  is the angle between the chord line of the  wing and the horizontal plane when the PPC is in non- powered gliding flight. [Figure 2-3] The PPC wing is  designed at a slight angle, with the chord line inclined  downward to the horizontal plane to maintain the  manufacturer-designed angle of attack during gliding,  level and climbing flight. This “trim angle” is built  into the powered parachute by the manufacturer and  cannot be adjusted by the pilot moving the controls.  

Pitch angle  is the angle the PPC wing chord makes  with the horizontal plane. Pitch angle is what you can  see. Many pilots confuse the pitch angle, which you  can easily see and feel, with the angle of attack which  may not be as perceptible. [Figure 2-4] For example,  the pitch angle in an engine-out glide could be minus  8 degrees, in level flight 10 degrees above the hori­ zon, and in a climb it could be 28 degrees above the  horizon. These are significantly different angles you  easily see. Pitch angles are covered in greater detail  in Chapter 6.  

Deck angle  is the angle of the cart’s lower frame  (from the front wheel to the rear wheels), to the land­ ing surface. The deck on the lower part of the conven­ tional cart frame can be used to visualize deck angle.  An imaginary line between the front and back wheel  axles can also be used on unconventional carts.Chapter 2, Aerodynamics of Flight.

Figure 2-2. Angle of incidence. Figure 2-2. Angle of incidence.  

Planform  is the shape or form of a wing as viewed  from above. The PPC wing comes in two wing plan­ forms: rectangular, and elliptical. [Figure 2-5] The el­ liptical planform leading and trailing edges are curved  to form an elliptical shape when viewed from the top  or bottom. These two shapes have unique flying char­ acteristics. Rectangular wings typically produce more  drag, are lower-performance, and do not move fore  and aft, relative to the cart, as quickly as elliptical  wings. These characteristics are more obvious when  the wing is inflating, during pitch changes, and when  flying in turbulence. Rectangular wings are therefore  more stable and require less effort to fly. Elliptical  wings are higher-performance and more efficient due  to less drag. Elliptical wings react more quickly with  changing conditions and require greater pilot experi­ ence and skill during inflation, in turbulent air, and  with abrupt throttle changes.  

Aspect ratio  is the wingspan divided by the average  chord line. A PPC with a common 500-square foot  rectangular wing (about a 38-foot wingspan) and with  a typical mean chord line of 13 feet, would have an  average aspect ratio of about 3. This relatively low  aspect ratio is less efficient at producing lift. An ellip­ tical wing with the same 500 square feet and a 45-foot  wing span and an 11-foot average chord would have  an aspect ratio of about 4. The PPC wing is similar to  airplane wings in that the aspect ratio will differ with  the specific design mission for the aircraft. Generally,  

![](images/3590aa18fd6dd1a0ce33876adae8886183240b49d1d8ea4e12caa2c844f326e9.jpg)  
Figure 2-3. Angle of trim and center of pressure in gliding  flight. Figure 2-3. Angle of trim and center of pressure in gliding flight.  

rectangular wings have lower aspect ratios and lower  efficiency than the higher aspect ratio and higher effi­ ciency elliptical wings. Generally, a high aspect ratio  wing, compared to a low aspect ratio wing, produces  higher lift at lower angles of attack with less induced  drag. [Figure 2-6].

Figure 2-5. Planform view of a PPC inflated wing:  rectangular and elliptical.  

Wing loading  is a term associated with the total  weight the ram-air wing must support. Wing loading  is found by dividing the total weight of the aircraft, in  pounds, by the total area of the wing, in square feet.  Wing loading is found by dividing the weight of the  aircraft, in pounds, by the total area of the wing, in  square feet. For example, the wing loading would be  2.0 pounds per square foot when 1,000 pounds—a  common weight for a two-seat PPC with two people  — is under a 500-square foot wing. If flying with one  person the aircraft weight might be 700 pounds and  the wing loading would decrease to 1.4 pounds per  square foot.  

Gliding flight  is flying in a descent with the engine at  idle or shut off.  

# Powered Parachute Wing 
 Pressurization and Flexibility  

The powered parachute has two distinctive modes: (1)  inflated, it is a ram-air wing with a curved arc­—a rec­ ognizable airfoil shape; and (2) deflated, it is a canopy  that is either lying flat on the ground or packed into  a bag.  

![](images/f781d43e4ccc329be8ffbd1cdeac7652fbe2b8ff8265b4df6b98ab4cebb7aee3.jpg)  

Note: Chapter 7, Takeoffs and Departure Climbs, will  detail the methods of getting the uninflated canopy  laying on the ground turned into a flying wing. Since  the aerodynamics of the PPC do not start until the  wing is completely inflated, this chapter will assume  each reference to the PPC wing is to an inflated ram- air wing already in the shape of an airfoil.  

The powered parachute ram-air wing retains its air­ foil shape due to the air pressurizing the inside cells  via the relative wind airflow being rammed into the  front openings of the canopy—thus the term “ram-air  wing.” The pressure inside the wing is much higher  than the outside top and bottom because the dynamic  pressure from the relative wind is converted to static  pressure to pressurize the wing. The greater the speed,  the greater the pressure inside the wing and the more  rigid the wing. The cell openings are designed to be  perpendicular to the relative wind to achieve maxi­ mum pressure from the relative wind. This static in­ ternal pressure harnessed from the relative wind is  called dynamic pressure (q), and is determined by the  velocity squared times the air density factor. [Figure  2-7] Note the dynamic air pressure converted to static  pressure at point A is constant throughout the wing  points B and C. This static pressure is always greater  than the pressure outside the wing at points X and Z.  

Cross-port openings are placed in the ribs of each cell,  connecting the adjoining cells. These cross-ports are  dispersed throughout the wing (with exception to the  outboard side of the end cells) to maintain positive  pressure throughout. The pressure is constant inside Planform view of a PPC inflated wing rectangular and elliptical.

the wing because the dynamic pressure hitting the  opening is the same for each cell and the speed is  the same. The cross-ports aid the complete wing in  becoming pressurized during inflation and maintain­ ing the pressure throughout the wing in turbulence.  [Figure 2-8]  

The inflatable wing airfoil generally remains a consis­ tent shape as designed by the manufacturer. However,  pilot control of the wing to make a turn significantly  changes the relative aerodynamic qualities of the PPC  wing by pulling down the trailing edge similar to a  flap on an airplane. [Figure 2-9]Dynamic pressures.

Figure 2-8. Cell openings and cross-port view. Cell openings and cross-port view.Aspect ratio comparisons for wings with similar areas.  

Faster speeds from smaller wings or more weight cre­ ate a higher pressure in the wing resulting in higher  control forces because of the higher internal pressure.  

# Forces in Flight  

Like all aircraft, the four forces that affect PPC flight  are thrust, drag, lift, and weight. [Figure 2-10] In  steady PPC flight:  

1.	The sum of all upward forces equals the sum of  all downward forces.

 	 2.	The sum of all forward forces equals the sum of  all backward forces.  

![](images/e0d3e45f0223826feeb0285b03d63bf31d720f6ab5683eb08f6eed724cf14b9f.jpg)  
Figure 2-9. PPC wing flexibility in flight. The lift equation.  

3.	The sum of all moments equals zero.  

THRUST – the forward force produced by a power­ plant/propeller as it forces a mass of air to the rear (usu­ ally said to act parallel to the longitudinal axis).  

# vs.  

DRAG – the aerodynamic force acting on the airfoil  lines and cart in the same plane and in the same direc­ tion as the relative wind.  

LIFT – the aerodynamic force caused by air flowing  over the wing that is perpendicular to the relative  wind.  

# vs.  

WEIGHT – the force of gravity acting upon a body.  

# Lift  

Lift opposes the downward force of weight and is pro­ duced by the dynamic effects of the surrounding air­ stream acting on the wing. Lift acts perpendicular to  the flight path through the wing’s center of lift. There  is a mathematical relationship between lift, angle of  attack, airspeed, altitude, and the size of the wing. In  the lift equation, these factors correspond to the terms  coefficient of lift, velocity, air density, and wing sur­ face area. The relation ship is expressed in Figure 2-11.  

This shows that for lift to increase, one or more of the  factors on the other side of the equation must increase.  Lift is proportional to the square of the velocity, or  airspeed, therefore, doubling airspeed quadruples the  amount of lift if everything else remains the same.  Small changes in airspeed create larger changes in  lift. Likewise, if other factors remain the same while  the coefficient of lift increases, lift also will increase.  The coefficient of lift goes up as the angle of attack  is increased. As air density increases, lift increases.  However, you will usually be more concerned with  

![](images/2752f12a64e6ff5e9c7556091585a710d59e6a9faa774fab4ba12efe04082631.jpg)

how lift is diminished by reductions in air density on  a hot day, or if you are operating at higher altitudes.  

All wings produce lift in two ways:

# Drag  

Drag is the resistance to forward motion through the  air. Drag opposes thrust. Aerodynamic drag comes in  two forms:  

1.	Induced drag: a result of the wing producing lift;

 	 2.	Parasite drag: resistance to the airflow from  the cart, its occupants, suspension lines from  the wing, interference drag from objects in the  airstream, and skin friction drag of the wing.  

Induced drag is the result of lift, and its amount var­ ies as discussed above for lift. Induced drag creates  organized circular vortices off the wing tips that gener­ ally track down and out from each wingtip. [Figure 2- 12] This is true for all aircraft that use wings including  PPC, weight-shift control and fixed wing aircraft. The  bigger and heavier the aircraft, the greater and more  powerful the wingtip vortices will be. This organized  swirling turbulence is an important factor to understand  for flight safety. Refer to Section 7-3 of the  Aeronau­ tical Information Manual  (AIM) or Chapter 12 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  (FAA-H- 8083-25) for additional discussion.  

Parasite drag is caused by the friction of air moving  over the structure. Just as with lift, parasite drag in­ creases as the surface area of the aircraft increases  and dramatically increases as airspeed increases,  at the square of the velocity. Therefore, doubling  the airspeed will quadruple your parasite drag.  [Figure 2-13]  

The PPC has relatively slow speeds, but plenty of  items (area) for the wind to strike including wing,  lines, pilot, cart, engine, wheels, and tubes. Parasitic  drag can be reduced by streamlining the items but  since the PPC flies at relatively slow airspeeds, the

extra weight, cost, and complexity of streamlining the  PPC is generally not incorporated into the design.  

Total Drag is the combination of parasite and induced  drag.  Total Drag  $=$  Parasitic Drag  $^+$   Induced Drag  

To help explain the force of drag, the mathematical  equation  $\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{C}\mathrm{d}\cdot\mathrm{q}\cdot\mathrm{S}$   is used. In this equation drag  (D) is the product of drag coefficient (Cd), dynamic  pressure (q) determined by the velocity squared times  the air density factor, and surface area (S) of the cart  and the ram-air wing (S). The drag coefficient is the  ratio of drag pressure to dynamic pressure. Turbulence - induced drag wintip vortices - created by lift of the ram-air wing.  

Induced and parasitic drag have opposite effects as  angle of attack decreases and speed increases. Note  the total drag. It is high at the slowest air speeds at  high angles of attack near the stall, decreases to the  lowest at the most efficient airspeed, and then pro­ gressively increases as the speed increases. The PPC  wing is typically designed to fly at a speed generally  above lowest overall total drag. Too slow, and the  wing would be near its critical angle of attack. Too  fast, and the power to maintain level flight or climb  would be excessive. The manufacturer determines the  speed range of the wing based on the weight range,  and the resultant location on the total drag diagram.  [Figure 2-14]Relationship between drag and speed.

# Weight  

Weight is a measure of the force of gravity acting upon  the mass of the PPC. It is the force that opposes lift,  and acts vertically downward through the aircraft’s  center of gravity. Weight consists of everything di­ rectly associated with the powered parachute in flight:  the combined load of the total PPC (wing, risers, en­ gine, cart, fuel, oil, etc.), people (clothing, helmets,  etc.), and baggage (charts, books, checklists, pencils,  handheld GPS, spare clothes, suitcase, etc.). In stabi­ lized level flight, when the vertical component of lift  is equal to the weight force, the PPC is in a state of  equilibrium and neither gains nor loses altitude.  

Because the trim angle is set at the factory, the PPC  airspeed is predetermined, before takeoff, by the  weight of the aircraft and the wing design. The more  weight, the more forward airspeed is generated.  Therefore, gravity is the primary force for creating  forward speed — pulling the wing through the rela­ tive wind while airborne. The forces in gliding flight  are very similar to those for an airplane or gliding  sailplane. [Figure 2-15] Specific numbers presented  in this chapter are examples to serve as a basis to  understand the concepts. Each PPC has unique fly­ ing characteristics and these numbers will be differ­ ent, but can be compared to your PPC to provide a  greater understanding of your unique performance.
 Note the component of weight acting along the flight  path. This component of weight is called thrust by  some but is more accurately the weight component  providing the forward force.Typical forces in gliding flight, with no engine thrust.

# Thrust  

Compared to an airplane, as discussed in Chapter 3  of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,  thrust serves different purposes in the PPC: (1) it is  used to accelerate the PPC to flying speed while in­ flating the wing (2) it is used to climb when at high  thrust, cruise level at medium thrust, and descend at  lower thrust. Variations in thrust have negligible effect  on PPC airspeed which remains relatively constant  whether climbing, descending, or in level flight.  

When enough thrust is added to produce level flight,  the relative wind stream becomes horizontal with  the earth; the angle of attack and speed remain about  the same. Just as described in the  Pilot’s Handbook  of Aeronautical Knowledge  for the airplane, thrust  equals total drag for level flight. [Figure 2-16]

When excess thrust is added to produce climbing  flight, the relative air stream becomes an inclined  plane leading upward, while angle of attack and speed  remain about the same. Just as described in the  Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  for the air­ plane, the excess thrust determines the climb  rate and  climb angle of the flight path. [Figure 2-17]

# Center of Gravity  

The center of gravity (CG) is the theoretical point  of concentrated weight of the aircraft. It is the point  within the PPC about which all the moments trying to  rotate it are balanced. The most obvious difference in  the center of gravity for a PPC is the vertical position  compared to an airplane, as it is much lower than the  wing. The  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowl­ edge  accurately states the center of gravity is gener­ ally in the vertical center of the fuselage. The same  is true for the PPC. However, the PPC wing is high  above the fuselage (cart) creating the unique pendu­ lum effect flying characteristics of the PPC (which  will be covered in detail later).  

In a two-seat PPC, the second seat is typically behind  the pilot’s seat, and the center of gravity is usually  located directly over the rear passenger seat. There­ fore, the center of gravity location does not change  significantly with or without a passenger. Fuel tanks  are typically located near the center of gravity so  any differences in fuel quantity will not significantly  change the center of gravity fore and aft with different  fuel quantities.  

# Axes of Rotation  

Motion about the lateral axis or pitch is primarily  controlled by the thrust of the propeller moving the  PPC pitch up (nose up) to climb and pitch down (nose  down) at reduced throttle.  

Turning happens about the longitudinal axis and is the  result of the rolling motion similar to an airplane with  aileron and rudder control. To turn, pull down the wing  trailing edge on the side you want to turn to with the  steering controls. This creates drag on the correspond­ ing trailing edge of the wing, thus dropping the inside  wing, and rolling the PPC into a banked turn. [Figure  2-18]  

There is not significant turning about the vertical axis  because the PPC wing is designed to fly directly into  the relative wind just like an airplane. Any sideways  skidding or yaw is automatically corrected to fly  straight with the wing design. An airplane uses the  vertical tail to fly directly into the relative wind like a  dart. The unique design of the PPC performs the same  function through the combination of wing profile/
 taper, the arch or curvature from tip to tip, washout  built into the wing and/or tip stabilizer design. These  factors make the PPC track directly into the relative  wind and eliminate the need for a vertical tail surface  and rudder to make coordinated turns. Designs and  methods vary with manufacturer and wing type, but  all PPCs are designed to track directly into the rela­ tive wind.  

# Ground Effect  

Ground effect is the interference of the ground with  the airflow and turbulence patterns created by the  wing. The most apparent indication from ground ef­ fect is the unexpected lift given to an aircraft as it flies  close to the ground — normally during takeoffs and  landings.PPC axes of rotation.  

Ground effect is usually felt when the wing is at al­ titudes of less than half of the wingspan. The typical  PPC wingspan is approximately 38 feet with an aver­ age wing height of about 20 feet. Therefore, ground  effect is negligible for PPCs and is typically not a factor.  

# Moments  

A body that rotates freely will turn about its cen­ ter of gravity. In aerodynamic terms for a PPC, the  mathematical value of a moment is the product of the  force times the distance from the CG (moment arm)  at which the force is applied.  

Wings generally want to pitch nose down or roll for­ ward and follow the curvature of the airfoil creating a  negative pitching moment. This is one of the reasons  airplanes have tails. The powered parachute does not  need a tail because the airfoil is locked into a specific  position relative to the cart by the suspension lines.  [Figure 2-19]. Any pitching moment for the wing is  counteracted by the strong pendulum effect (weight  of the cart hanging directly under the center of lift).  Any swinging of the weight creates moments that  act to stabilize the swing. The wing aids to dampen  swinging. This pendulum effect is unique to the PPC  because the cart has the ability to rotate around the  PPC pendulum axis of rotation in addition to rotating  about the CG.  

To understand the pendulum effect, attach a small  weight (a pencil or paper clip works) to a 24-inch  string. Note the weight always wants to hang directly  under where you hold it. If you hold the string still  and move the weight to the side, the weight swings  and stabilizes under where you hold it. Gravity, pull­ ing down on the weight to stabilize it directly un­ der where it is hanging, is PPC pendulum stability.
 [Figure 2-20]  

![](images/d9a650cfb489778b6267a46b170d041a7aab587d0d30c9e1367c218399d0bb24.jpg)  

![](images/67ac025e2ca4d018114111b1acf0d2ae5e8010ba2cf9f4d5097792f070d26e2d.jpg)  
Figure 2-19. Powered parachute airfoil is locked into  position by the lines and weight of the cart.  

Pendulum stability is the result of a number of PPC  design characteristics: there is no downward force  from a horizontal tail that must be counteracted by the  wing producing more lift; there is no weight of the tail  that must be lifted; and there is no tail to impose extra  drag on the aircraft. Gravity is the primary force that  stabilizes the aircraft using pendulum stability.  

The “dynamic pendulum effect” can be demonstrated  by swinging the weight around and then stopping the  swinging to notice that the weight keeps swinging  from the momentum. The swinging weight is known  as the “dynamic pendulum effect” which will be dis­ cussed in detail later.  

# Thrust Line Moments  

PPC designs can have different moments caused  by thrust; the propeller thrust may be above the  CG (Figure 2-21 left) or go through the CG (Figure  2-21 right). Since the cart swings free in pitch, this  CG thrust moment can slightly affect the pitch of the  cart in relation to the wing.  

PPCs with an attachment point above the thrust line  have a pitching nose up moment as shown in Figure  2-21 (both diagrams), with a thrust line, wing attach  point, and arm “b.”  

# Gravity Moment  

There is a moment arm from the CG of the cart,  to the cart/wing attachment (see “arms” in Figure  2-22). The longer the distance from the CG to the  Powered parachute airfoil is locked into position by the lines and weight of the cart.  

![](images/ff9ec87281a05a3a6ce20714c17ef09de77f86c0c0aa0700ac39f85999fef115.jpg)

wing attachment point, the more stable the cart pitch  is from thrust moments. The higher the wing attach­ ment point above the CG, the more stable the cart is  from swinging underneath and the less the cart will  pitch up when thrust is applied.  

A higher hang point will also better stabilize the PPC  cart in turbulence because the moment of the weight  and the larger “d” arm creates a larger stabilizing mo­ ment. [Figure 2-22]  

For ground operations, the moment arm distance “c”  cannot be too great or the front wheel would lift off  the ground prematurely, trying to inflate the wing (see  right side of Figure 2-22).  

During flight, the advantage of a high attachment  point arm  $\mathrm{"c"}$   is less swinging around of the cart un­ der the wing, and less cart “pitch up” when throttle is  applied to climb. This high attachment point creates  thrust that is now pointed slightly down to the rela­ tive wind, which has two significant effects. First, it  creates a negative P-factor, counteracting increased  torque. The second effect is a disadvantage: less climb  rate or more thrust required for the same climb rate.  This is due to the increased load on the wing from the  thrust, requiring more speed and/or angle of attack to  lift the total load. [Figure 2-23]

way, the nose wheel should be between 7 and 11 inch­ es above the pavement. The POH specifies the wing  fore and aft wing attachment points to the cart. [Fig­ ure 2-24] Attaching the wing too far forward would  cause the nose wheel to be higher than it should. At­ taching the wing too far back would place the nose  wheel too low, where it would hit first for landings.  Balancing the cart properly per the POH is important  to make sure the cart is hanging properly under the

wing and ensure thrust is properly aligned as designed  by the manufacturer. Nose wheel low means thrust  pointing down, increasing loads, and airspeed. Nose  wheel high has the opposite effect. Thrust aligned too  high or too low results in reduced thrust and unwanted  P-factor.

Manufacturers must balance the cart stability for take­ off and flight, along with the thrust moment to achieve  the best design for the specific application.  

# Stability  

A stable aircraft is one that will routinely return to its  original attitude after it has been disturbed from this  condition; usually this means returning to straight- and-level flight after encountering turbulence that dis­ rupts a normal flightpath. The more stable the aircraft,  the easier it is to return to a straight and level position.  The natural tendency of the pendulum — the PPC cart  hanging under the wing — is to return to its original  centered position under the wing. The pendulum de­ sign gives the PPC airborne positive dynamic stability  and positive static stability for roll and pitch because  the weight of the pendulum wants to return the PPC  to level stabilized flight. No matter what maneuver  within the POH limitations the PPC is put through  (regardless of whether it is pilot induced or turbulence  created), as soon as the disruptive force stops, the air­ craft is designed to return to a stabilized flight condi­ tion, with virtually no pilot input. Figure 2-25 shows  the movements of the PPC as it auto-corrects from a  side gust of wind.  

![](images/be1479153c14c93613e5980c601409f7638115d3ed0574960879e902dd03f450.jpg)

# PPC Angle of Attack Characteristics  

# Normal Flying Conditions  

For all practical purposes, the wing’s lift in a steady  state normal climb is the same as it is in a steady level  flight at the same airspeed. Though the flightpath has  changed when the climb has been established, the an­ gle of attack of the wing with respect to the inclined  flightpath reverts to practically the same value, as  does the lift. The angle of attack remains relatively  constant for constant weights during stabilized flight  for glide, level cruise or climb. However, wind gusts,  flying in turbulence, quick uncoordinated flight (as  covered later), or aerobatic maneuvers can change the  PPC angle of attack. PPC limitations in the POH are  specifically written to avoid any maneuver that would  temporarily get the PPC into a situation of too high  or too low an angle of attack. The PPC is specifically  designed to fly at an angle of attack to avoid stalls  (resulting from too high an angle of attack), and avoid  wing collapses (resulting from too low an angle of at­ tack). Each manufacturer specifically determines the  limitations so a proper angle of attack is maintained  throughout the flight operation range.  

The basic design of the powered parachute is to fly  at a relatively constant speed which results in a con­ stant angle of attack. However, angle of attack can  change just as with any aircraft as when a gust of wind High wing attachment point effects in flight.

changes the direction the air is hitting the airfoil. [Fig­ ure 2-26]  

The pilot can add weight or increase loads which may  also increase the angle of attack slightly.  

# Flaring Increases Angle of Attack  

The flare (pulling down the trailing edges of the  wing—and thus lowering the trailing edge) increases  the angle of attack. [Figure 2-27] In a flare, the trail­ ing edges of the wing are pulled down (usually, as  both foot steering controls are pushed forward). This  is similar to lowering the flaps on an airplane: lift is  increased, drag is increased, and for a PPC, the angle  of attack is increased. The result is that the higher drag  wing slows down and thus the wing moves backward  relative to the cart. So as the total weight of the pen­PPC stability after a side wind gust.  

dulum (the cart and occupants) moves forward of the  wing, the angle of attack increases, generating more  lift and more drag. The pendulum is the weight of the  CG under the wing which swings forward for this  transient situation due to pendulum effect.  

Note that flare provides a temporary large increase in  the angle of attack (AOA) until the pendulum swings  back underneath the wing. This action thus returns the  wing to the normal stable flight configuration — the  cart (the total weight of the pendulum) under the cen­ ter of the wing. Therefore, a flare will only temporari­ ly add an increase to lift and drag. Once the pendulum  swings back down, the drag of the wing, and therefore  the reduced airspeed, will continue until the flare is  released.AOA changes as wind hits the airfoil.  

![](images/6b940273ba8a60c29795ea2e832f8aa8021c8d3cb7678209eb1513882e67ff53.jpg)  
Figure 2-27. Flare on landing typically increases the angle  of attack.  

# Porpoising Creates Variations in AOA  

Another slight variation in the angle of attack is the  swinging pendulum action of the PPC when high  thrust engines provide strong and immediate full  thrust of the propeller. This extra thrust swings the  cart through the pendulum arc relative to its position  under the wing. This is why many times you will see  the PPC take off and porpoise until it stabilizes. This  is a good example of the dynamic pendulum effect.  As the propeller thrust swings the cart out front, the  cart peaks then swings back to center. The cart suc­ cessively swings back and forth, continuing to reduce  oscillations until it stabilizes in a climb. This porpois­ ing is most common with a high power engine. This  can be eliminated by using gradual throttle increases  so as not to create a dynamic pendulum effect enter­ ing a climb.  

# Stalls: Exceeding the Critical Angle  of Attack  

The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack at  which a wing stalls regardless of airspeed, flight at­ titude, or weight. The drawings in Figure 2-28 show  airflow over a typical rectangular PPC wing. The first  shows a laminar, smooth, lift-generating airflow—one  that is typical when the angle of attack is within the  flight range. The second depicts an exceeded angle  of attack, turbulence and loss of the lifting force.  [Figure 2-28]Wings stall due to an excessive angle of attack.  

![](images/78a33df9bef81081c70611aa2dfcab405e7c6da2cdc2139e0d6353c9b4038b48.jpg)  
Figure 2-28. Wings stall due to an excessive angle of attack.Flare on landing typically increases the angle of attack.  

Unlike a fixed-wing aircraft that takes constant aware­ ness of angle of attack to prevent a stall, the powered  parachute wing is designed by the manufacturers to  maintain a specified range of angle of attack and air­ speeds. It is resistant to stalls because for all practical  purposes, it is designed to fly at a constant normal op­ erating range. This range is maintained if the operator  flies within the operating limitations specified in the  POH. Flying the PPC within the limitations specified  in the POH and avoiding turbulence means you will  not exceed the critical angle of attack and stall the  wing.  

However, situations that could contribute to a stall are:  

•	 A large increase in wing drag (full-flare)  — which the PPC pilot controls by pulling the  wing back, thus increasing the AOA. (Note: A  full-flare is normally used and recommended  only for landings.) •	 A quick full RPM throttle input,  creating a  climbing dynamic pendulum effect loading the  wing. •	 A quick reduction of throttle during a high pitch  angle climb. This quickly turns a high pitch  climb into a high angle of attack. The wing is  initially pitched high, climbing the inclined  plane under full power, then quickly changes  to a gliding flight path when the throttle is  reduced, just like an airplane. •	 A wind gust from flying in turbulent air.  

To prevent a stall, do not go to full-throttle while hold­ ing a full-flare, or as specified in the POH. Note: For  explanation of a stall recovery, see Chapter 12: Night,  Abnormal, and Emergency Procedures.  

# Turning Effect  

Torque is a reaction to the mass of the turning propel­ ler. If the propeller is turning to the right, the reaction  is for the cart to want to turn to the left. Therefore, a  right turn is sometimes designed into the PPC system  to counteract the torque.  

PPC manufacturers compensate for this   with various  designs:  

1.	Dual (counter-spinning) propellers. This is an  ideal way to counter prop torque, but counter- rotating gearboxes are complicated, more  expensive, and weigh more.

 	 2.	Different riser lengths. On a clockwise-turning  propeller, the left riser is longer than the right.

 	 3.	Swivel the wing attachment on a tilt bar above  the cart.

 	 4.	Adjust the PPC frame (longer on the left, shorter  on the right) to compensate for the engine torque  (for a clockwise spinning prop).  

Additionally, P-factor, as discussed in the  Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  can be a factor,  producing a left turn if the nose of the cart is too high  through improper CG balance of the PPC. Rotating  propeller gyroscopic action can also produce turning  tendencies if a force is applied which would deflect  the propeller from its existing plane of rotation.  

There is no corkscrew effect of the slipstream on a  PPC because it does not have a tail in the propeller  prop blast.  

# Weight, Load and Speed Changes  

Greater load factor creates increases in speed. For un­ accelerated and stabilized flight there are only slight  variations in speed for different flight conditions.  [Figure 2-29] For an 800-pound PPC in gliding flight,  both the lift and drag components support the weight  of the PPC (lift is 759 pounds, and drag is 252 pounds,  with the resultant 800 pounds vertical force).  

In level flight, the PPC does not have the vertical  component of total drag to support the weight so ad­ ditional lift must be generated through speed or angle  of attack increases.Forces differ between gliding and level flight.  

![](images/231999a5d77538cc2cdc2ea56ee5a2b3c769ec1cac01eefde9f8ecbd88c61403.jpg)  
Figure 2-29. Forces differ between gliding and level flight.  

The numbers are small and difficult to measure or  feel so the industry rule of thumb is to assume the  PPC flies at a constant speed and angle of attack with  changes in throttle. However, increased load (weight)  and load factor has a significant effect on speed.  [Fig­ ure 2-30]  

As discussed in Chapter 2 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge  the following points apply  to powered parachute operations:  

•	 During straight and level flight, the lift opposes  the weight. •	 In a banked turn, the lift is no longer directly  opposite the weight; it is losing some of the  vertical component of lift. More lift is needed  so the vertical component of lift will equal the  weight. •	 In a banked turn, lift must be increased and load  factor goes up. [Figure 2-30]  

In a 45-degree turn, the 800 pounds weight would  equal 800 times 1.4 or 1,120 pounds total load. This  45-degree turn,   $1.4~\mathrm{G}$   loading is the same as adding  320 pounds of weight to the 800 pounds. This new  1,120 pounds of lift must be produced by the wing by  increased speed and/or angle of attack. If all the addi­ tional lift is produced from airspeed, airspeed would  increase about 5 MPH, a noticeable difference. Refer­ ence your  Pilot’s Operating Handbook  to understand  the specific design considerations for the aircraft you  will be flying.  

# PPC Aerodynamics Summary  

The following summarizes PPC aerodynamics:  

•	 Increasing throttle causes the PPC to climb,  decreasing the throttle allows the PPC to  descend. •	 The PPC flies at a relatively constant airspeed  and angle of attack in normal flying conditions. •	 The weight of the PPC controls steady state  airspeed under similar conditions of wing size  and type, trim, steering line settings, and pilot  flare. Increased weight or load factor increases  speed and/or angle of attack. •	 The lighter the weight, the slower the airspeed,  the less control pressure on the wing, and the  slower your descent. •	 The heavier the cart (total weight under the  wing), the faster the airspeed, the more effort  required for maneuvers (foot steering pressure),  and the faster your descent. •	 The wing set (rectangular or elliptical), size,  and cart weight have a strong influence on PPC  performance and maneuverability.Loads and turning forces.

Although powered parachutes come in an array of  shapes and sizes, the basic design features are fun­ damentally the same. All powered parachutes con­ sist of an airframe (referred to as a cart) a propeller  powered by an engine, and a ram-air inflated wing.  [Figure 3-1]  

![](images/548292c26174285c5729353a3d156147dc7f7605412f224468ee1069e8b9bc4e.jpg)

# The Airframe  

Most powered parachute airframes are manufactured  with aircraft-grade hardware. A few PPC manufactur­ ers are building fiber-composite carts. The airframe’s  tubular construction means light weight and ease of  replacement if tubes are bent. The airframe includes  one or two seats, flight controls, and an instrument  panel. The airframe also incorporates the engine, the  fuel tank, the propeller and points of attachment for  the wing and steering lines.  

Although side-by-side configurations exist, in most  powered parachutes the pilot and passenger are seated  in a tandem (fore and aft) configuration. Dual flight  controls are required for training. Not all PPCs have  full dual controls; depending on the configuration of  the cart and added controls (that are optional from  different airframe manufacturers) the flight instruc­ tor can adequately control the aircraft during training  from the rear seat during takeoff, flight, and landing  procedures with dual throttle controls. While in the  rear seat, the flight instructor can have positive con­ trol of the aircraft at all times by physically pulling  on the steering lines and using a dual control throttle.  Like airplanes, not all powered parachutes are ad­ equately configured to conduct flight training. The  flight instructor with a powered parachute endorse­ ment should determine his or her ability to control  each individual PPC from the back seat with the dual  controls for training purposes. [Figure 3-2]Chapter 3—Components and Systems  

![](images/a46a965ad8a150c113fc5766c8719d1df0736b9ef97f55229d12d51bd4d34e4a.jpg)  
Figure 3-2. Powered parachutes used for training must be  equipped with dual controls.Powered parachutes used for training must be equipped with dual controls.A typical powered parachute cart.  

The pilot flies from the front seat in order to reach the  steering bars, throttle control, ground steering control  and magneto switches, and to keep the CG in balance;  you cannot fly alone from the back seat for this rea­ son.  

The cart by itself is not very aerodynamic because  it does not need to be; it flies at slower airspeeds.  However, without the wing attached and inflated to  limit speed, the pilot needs to be careful to avoid high  speeds, such as when taxiing to and from the hangar  for canopy layout. The wheels, their bearings, and  the cart suspension were not designed to handle high  speeds.  

Some manufacturers use an adjustable front seat  to allow for the varied length of the pilot’s legs  to comfortably reach the steering bars. Powered

parachutes can be outfitted with a variety of seat­ belts, including a four-point harness system that  securely fastens each occupant into their seat.  [Figure 3-3]  

Most powered parachutes have three wheels, or a tri­ cycle gear configuration, although some have four.  Ground steering is typically a steering bar connected  to the nosewheel that moves left and right. Some pow­ ered parachutes have a tiller device for ground steer­ ing. There are a number of ground steering designs  that vary between manufacturer, make, and model.  

Brakes are an optional piece of equipment on the  powered parachute, as the square foot area of the  parachute itself provides aerodynamic braking. Pilots  should use smooth and controlled operation of the  throttle on the ground to maintain safe and control­ lable ground speeds, particularly when taxiing with  the chute inflated. Students should practice throttle  control to learn how far the PPC takes to come to a  full stop when the power is reduced to idle. However,  for runway incursion prevention and general safety,  brakes are advised and highly recommended so you  can stop when you need to. Never use your feet as a  form of braking, as physical injury is probable.  

# Center of Gravity Adjustments  

Each manufacturer has specific procedures in the  Pilot’s Operating Handbook   (POH) to adjust the CG  of the cart, so that the cart is hanging at the proper  nose high/nose low position—including the weight  position in the cart and the fore/aft position of the  wing attachment points.  

As discussed in Chapter 2, the attachment points for  the wing (parachute) must be adjusted for variations  in pilot weight, which affect the center of gravity (CG)  location of the cart.  

There are typically two types of wing attachment sys­ tems: center of gravity adjustment tubes, or a bracket  with a number of fore and aft attachment points. Each  of these systems performs the same task. Either sys­ tem adjusts the wing attachment points based on the  cart CG. This is primarily based on the weight of the  occupant in the front seat, usually the pilot. The rear  seat occupant’s weight does not typically come into  consideration when determining the CG position of  the PPC, as the rear seat is usually positioned very  near the cart CG. To maintain the best overall per-
 formance, the aircraft needs to fly with a slight nose- up attitude, as specified in the aircraft POH.  

Use the POH to determine the proper adjustment for  the particular aircraft because there are many configu­The harness should be fastened snug but not tight.

rations and designs that vary by manufacturer, make,  and model.  

# Multiple Attachment Points Bracket  

The attachment point bracket on the cart is one meth­ od to select the fore and aft wing attachment position  for proper CG adjustments. [Figure 3-4] Always refer  to the POH for weight and balance information spe­ cific to the powered parachute you are flying.  

# Center of Gravity Adjuster Tubes  

The term “CG tubes” sometimes refers to the three  tubes that meet at the point of rigging for the wing 

 (upper CG tube, lower CG tube and center CG tube). 

 [Figure 3-5] Sometimes the term “CG tube” refers  only to the tube that is adjustable, and the other tubes  that meet at the rigging points are called outrigger  arms.  

# Instrument Panel  

The instrument panel is in front of the pilot and pro­ vides engine and flight information. The pilot is re­ sponsible for maintaining collision avoidance with  a proper and continuous scan surrounding the pow­ ered parachute, as well as monitoring the information  available from the instrument panel. The pilot must  process the outside cues along with the instrumenta­ tion throughout the flight for a sound decision-making  process.  

The ignition switches are usually located on the in­ strument panel and have two positions: ON, which  allows power to make contact with the spark plugs,  

![](images/9ba4b57d9f4648830b40c0f8fdb2c05f605ddc467cba2df706eb48f3e7fe3c5d.jpg)  
Figure 3-6. Some instrument panels will have just a few  digital or analog gauges for EGT and RPM.PPC CG adjustment example.  

or OFF, which is a closed switch to GROUND and  removes the power source from the spark plugs. Typi­ cally, PPC engines have two spark plugs per cylinder,  two switches and two completely separate ignition  systems. Some single place PPCs with smaller en­ gines have only a single spark plug per cylinder, one  ignition switch, and a single ignition system.  

The FAA defines the required minimum instrumen­ tation for PPCs; engine manufacturers may recom­ mend certain instruments be installed on the aircraft  to monitor the performance of their particular engine.  For example, on a liquid-cooled engine, the manufac­ turer may recommend instrumentation to monitor en­ gine gas temperatures (EGT), water temperatures and  RPM. On an air-cooled engine, the manufacturer’s  recommendation may be EGT, cylinder head temper­ ature (CHT) and RPM. Additional instruments can be  added as desired by the individual aircraft owner.  

Some PPCs may only have a few analog gauges. [Figure 3-6] Some makes and models may be  equipped with an engine information system (EIS).  [Figure 3-7] The EIS is a flight computer and screen  that receives input signals from sending units connect­ ed to engine and flight probes or sensors. The com­ puters are pre-programmed for different makes and  models of engines. Engine information may include:  RPM, EGT, CHT, water temperature, fuel quantity, an  hour meter and a voltmeter. Flight instruments may  include altimeter, vertical speed indicator and a GPS.  

This engine and flight information is viewed on the  LCD screen and has function keys, allowing the  pilot to move between display screens that contain the  computer’s input. When the display button is pressed,  

![](images/43f36a7f90e5b6d5aa0dd3cf92f39f67e8708990c2034a8ff5158a8d3010692d.jpg)  
Figure 3-7. Typical engine information system.  

each individual screen will clearly identify the infor­ mation being displayed.  

The information systems are also capable of alerting  the pilot when any engine or flight parameters are ex­ ceeded, usually via a warning light mounted on the  instrument panel. Although the EIS is a valuable tool,  the ability to interpret the information is equally im­ portant.  

For the interperetation of any engine and flight instru­ ment, you need to completely understand the engine  limitations, parameters, and the messages the instru­ ment provides you. Sensing the proper operation of the  aircraft and engine is a key factor to the safe operation  of any aircraft. Being able to interpret engine sounds  and unusual vibrations is essential for any pilot.  

As with any aircraft or instrument operation, see the  POH for each individual make and model operating  instructions.  

# Additional Equipment  

A GPS can sometimes be used to determine ground  speed while flying. A GPS is also a useful tool to en­ hance navigation for cross-country flying. Review  Chapter 14 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge  for information on the calculations asso­ ciated with determining wind speed, ground speed,  fuel consumption, and time enroute.  

Communication and navigation radios, transponders,  GPS and LORAN receivers are not required to fly  a powered parachute in Class G airspace. You must  have the required equipment on board to operate in  Class B, C, D or E airspace.  

Equipment requirements can be found in the regula­ tions. Powered parachutes must meet these require­ ments. Even though many powered parachutes have  strobe lighting to aid in the visual sighting of the  aircraft, additional positional lighting is required for  night operations. See Chapter 12 for more informa­ tion.  

# Electrical System  

Powered parachutes are typically equipped with a 12  volt direct-current electrical system. A basic powered  parachute electrical system consists of a magneto,  alternator or generator, battery, master/battery switch,  voltage regulator, and associated electrical wiring.  

Electrical energy stored in a battery provides a source  of electrical power for starting the engine and a lim­ ited supply of electrical power for use in the event the  alternator or generator fails.  

The electrical system is turned on or off with a mas­ ter switch. Turning the master switch to the ON po­ sition provides electrical energy to all the electrical  equipment circuits with the exception of the ignition  system. Equipment that commonly uses the electrical  system for its source of energy includes:  

•	 Position lights. • 	Anticollision lights. • 	Instrument lights. • 	Radio equipment. • 	Electronic instrumentation. • 	Electric fuel pump. • 	Starting motor.  

Fuses or circuit breakers are used in the electrical sys­ tem to protect the circuits and equipment from electri­ cal overload. Spare fuses of the proper amperage limit  should be carried in the powered parachute to replace  defective or blown fuses. Circuit breakers have the  same function as a fuse but can be manually reset,  rather than replaced, if an overload condition occurs  in the electrical system. Placards at the fuse or circuit  breaker panel identify the circuit by name and show  the amperage limit.  

An ammeter is used to monitor the performance of  the electrical system. The ammeter shows if the al­ ternator/generator is producing an adequate supply of  electrical power. It also indicates whether or not the  battery is receiving an electrical charge.Typical engine information system.  

A voltage meter also provides electrical information  as to the battery voltage, an additional status of your  electrical system.  

A voltage regulator changes the variable output of the  magneto or generator to the 12-volt DC level for the  battery and the electric system. The voltage output is  typically higher than the battery voltage. For example,  a 12-volt battery would be fed from the magneto/gen­ erator/alternator system through the voltage regulator  which produces approximately 13 to 14 volts. This  higher voltage keeps the battery charged.  

# The Steering Bars  

The steering bars are located just aft of the nosewheel  and mounted on each side of the aircraft; they move  forward and aft when the pilot applies foot pres­ sure. [Figure 3-8] The steering lines from the trailing  edge of the wing are attached to the outer ends of the  steering bars. (Some manufacturers have developed  a steering pedal system on their airframes, although  the steering lines function in the same manner.) The  main steering lines divide into various smaller lines,  which attach to multiple points on the trialing edge of  the wing. Pushing on either one of the steering bars  causes the steering lines to pull down the correspond­ ing surface of the trailing edge on the wing, creat­ ing drag. This in turn slows that side of the wing and  banks the PPC into a turn.  

Pushing both steering bars simultaneously causes  the steering lines to pull down equally on the trailing  edge, which causes two things to happen: it decreases  the powered parachute’s forward speed by increas­ ing the drag and it changes the shape of the wing, Steering bars are located just aft of the nosewheel and mounted on each side of the aircraft.  

![](images/131d8df8907c43cad061ca890f630ffd273fad45a93483fd1e16100f0a184d30.jpg)

increasing angle of attack which increases lift. This  procedure, called “flaring” or “braking the wing” al­ lows the pilot to touch down at a slower rate of speed  and descent, thus creating a smoother landing, which  results in less wear and tear on the aircraft as a whole.  [Figure 3-9]

# Wings and Components  

The powered parachute wing is unique, as compared  to a fabric wing on an airplane, in that when it is not  inflated it loses its ability to produce lift. When a  powered parachute wing is inflated or pressurized, it  becomes semi-rigid and is capable of producing lift  and supporting a load. Rather than being bolted to the  fuselage like an airplane, the parachute wing is at­ tached to the cart by lines and cables which are known  as risers.  

The wings are manufactured by attaching an upper  and lower section of skin to ribs. [Figure 3-10] The  ribs of the wing determine the airfoil shape. [Fig­ ure 3-11] The shape of a powered parachute wing  will change slightly when faced with different gross  weights, air pressures, and environmental conditions  such as moisture, air temperature and wind.  

Different wing manufacturers use different fabric  treatments to render the fabric airtight, so the air that  enters the wing cannot escape through the fabric sur­ face. The top surface of the wing is generally treated  to help protect it from ultraviolet light and the ele­ ments. Keeping the powered parachute wing out of  direct sunlight will increase its useful life.  

If the fabric degrades and air is allowed to escape  through pores of the cloth, the overall flight perfor­ mance of the wing is greatly reduced. If your pow­

ered parachute wing should become too porous, more  groundspeed may be needed to pressurize the wing,  takeoff distance may increase, more RPM may be  required to hold altitude, and fuel consumption may  increase.  

At first sight, the suspension lines on the powered  parachute wing might appear like an unorganized wad  of strings. On the contrary, each line has a distinct  purpose and each line has distinct properties. The sus­ pension lines are sometimes designated A through D  and differ between manufacturers; check your POH to  know the line labels for your PPC. [Figure 3-12] The  front suspension lines are located at the leading edge  and the steering lines connect to the trailing edge. The Airflow into the wing.

Figure 3-12. Front and rear suspension lines. Front and rear suspension lines.  

suspension lines come together at a point where they  connect with the riser. (The risers are the connection  between the suspension lines and the cart.) Many  manufacturers color-code the wing suspension lines  to assist the pilot in their preflight inspection and lay­ out of the wing prior to inflation. [Figure 3-12]  

Suspension lines must be constructed of very strong  materials, yet remain very small in profile to reduce  parasite drag. The most commonly used materials are  polyaramid and polyethelene, which are both carbon  based.  

Kevlar ®  is a common polyaramid used for suspension  lines. Its properties render it extremely strong, as well  as resistant to stretching or shrinking, and it is not sus­ ceptible to temperature changes. However, one criti­ cal drawback of polyaramids is that they tend to kink  or knot when looped around. When polyaramids are  used to construct suspension lines, they are encased in  a skin of a terylene product, like Dacron ®  or a product  with similar properties. Polyethelene materials, such  as Spectra ® , Dyneema ®  or Technora ® , are very strong  as well as more flexible than polyaramids, which  makes them more durable under hard use. However,  polyethelene materials are more likely to stretch or  shrink, and they are more susceptible to temperature  changes. If your wing is equipped with polyethelene  suspension lines, it is imperative you do not store your Canopy cross-section.  

equipment in  a place that might experience extreme  temperatures. The POH or owner manual provided by  the chute manufacturer will specify limits for tempera­ ture and storage.  

Every line on the powered parachute wing is precisely  measured and fitted to a specific location. Therefore,  it is imperative to inspect the wing during preflight,  in addition to having the wing and its lines inspected  periodically by qualified technicians. The technician  will conduct strength tests as well as look for wear  and compromised attachment points; refer to your  wing manufacturer’s specifications for inspection  parameters. Under no circumstances should powered  parachute suspension lines be spliced or tied if sev­ ered! Each line’s length and strength is specifically  calibrated. If you tie a knot in the line you will change  the specifically-engineered flight characteristics of the  wing, rendering it unairworthy.  

# Risers  

Also known as “V lines,” the risers are the intermedi­ ate link between the suspension lines and the airframe  or the attachment point of the wing to the airframe.  

![](images/d21250832dcddb8897fe8d525fd1c121cf0176c9088fe58650a328c2236be918.jpg)  
Figure 3-13. The risers are constructed of nylon webbing  that takes on the appearance of two straps incorporating a  main cable and a safety cable as one unit. The risers are constructed of nylon webbing that takes on the appearance of two straps incorporating a main cable and a safety cable as one unit.  

The risers are generally constructed of webbing,  which takes on the appearance of two straps that in­ corporate a main cable and a safety cable as one unit.  [Figure 3-13] Some of the older designs of wings may  have braided wire cables serving as their risers. The  risers are connected to the suspension lines and to the  aircraft with various connections such as with D-rings  and eyebolts.  

During flight, as discussed in Chapter 2, propeller- driven aircraft are affected by the rotation of engine  components and the propeller. This is commonly  referred to as the “left turning tendency,” which in­ cludes torque and sometimes P factor. There are sev­ eral design features that have been incorporated into  airplanes to counteract the left turning tendency from  a clockwise turning propeller. Powered parachute de­ signers can counteract the turning effect by chang­ ing the length of the riser cables on one side of the  airframe. By decreasing the length of the right riser  cable, the wing is given a slight right turn, just enough  to cancel the effects of torque at cruise thrust settings.  This design feature of the powered parachute wing  risers makes it imperative not to mistakenly attach the  different length riser cables on the wrong side of the  airframe. Remember: the left main and the left safety  cables, from the pilot’s seat, are longer than the right  main and the right safety cables. Mixing the right and  the left cables will result in a pronounced left turn;  especially during takeoff when the engine is at full  throttle, which could jeopardize the safety of all con­ cerned.  

Engine installations with a counterclockwise rotating  propeller require opposite adjustments. It is important  to know which direction the propeller turns for your  PPC to accurately counter turning tendencies.  

Alternately, the wing could have the same length ris­ ers, and the cart could have a higher attachment point  for the left riser. This is why each wing is designed  for each cart and should not be interchanged: the wing  and the cart is a complete system.  

# The Fuel Tank  

The powered parachute is usually equipped with fuel  tanks ranging in capacity from 5 to 20 gallons. As  with any aircraft, knowing how much fuel your fuel  tank holds is crucial to flight operations. The light- sport aircraft powered parachute has no limitations as  to the size of the fuel tank, unlike its ultralight vehicle  predecessor. Most PPC powerplants require auto fuel  mid-grade or higher to be burned (see the powerplant  operating handbook for specific engine specifica­ tions).  

Generally, the fuel tank is located close to the center  of gravity, so fuel burn does not affect the balance of  the aircraft. Some fuel tanks are clear for visual in­ spection of the amount of fuel on board while others  are dark. Dark tanks or hidden tanks generally have a  sight tube to assist the pilot in determining the actual  amount of fuel. [Figure 3-14] Some powered para­ chute manufacturers offer optional fuel level probes  and instrument panel analog gauges or incorporate  this information into the EIS. As fuel is used by the  engine, air needs to enter the tank and take its place;  otherwise a vacuum will form inside the fuel tank  preventing the fuel pump from drawing fuel. This is  usually accomplished with a fuel venting system. This  can be a vent in the fuel cap or some other means that  vents elsewhere, providing the ability for the fuel tank  to breathe. Any vent system must be free of debris or  it will cause fuel starvation in flight. This is especially  true when a small hole is in the fuel cap that can be  easily plugged. Check the fuel venting system during  each preflight inspection.  

![](images/320c2c823963718f015a64d44de03096069a9927aa4ed4fddba473af7ed8e17f.jpg)  

# Figure 3-14. Fuel tank with sight tube. Fuel tank with sight tube.Reduction drives reduce the propeller RPM from the engine RPM by about half.Powered parachute throttle.  

The fuel shut-off valve can be located anywhere in the  fuel line. It is important to make sure the fuel valve  is open and stays open for normal operation. Most  designs have a fuel tank sump drain valve to remove  water and solid contaminants. Each design is differ­ ent and the PPC POH will specify how to conduct  this check.  

# Throttle System  

The throttle is the pilot’s hand control to regulate the  power provided by the engine. The configuration of  the throttle control varies from one cart manufacturer  to another. Refer to the POH of each individual PPC  for function reference. [Figure 3-15]  

![](images/eece66240f3748e208511f4bd199490aed01c886fb3d2443ebbe07218c424e74.jpg)

Figure 3-16.  Reduction drives  reduce the propeller RPM from  the engine RPM by about half.  

# The Powerplant  

The typical powered parachute engine can be two- or  four-stroke, liquid- or air-cooled, 50 to 100 horsepow­ er. Some engines have electric starters and some have  pull starters. Most PPC engines have reduction drives  that, when attached, reduce the propeller RPM to half  to one quarter the engine RPM. [Figure 3-16] The en­ gines are as varied as the powered parachutes they  power. Modern technology has allowed the powered  parachute engine to become lighter, more efficient  and, most importantly, dependable. Chapter 4 covers  the powerplant in more detail.  

# The Propeller  

Propellers are “power converters” that change the  engine horsepower into “thrust.” Thrust is the force  that propels the aircraft through the air by pushing  the powered parachute forward. Aerodynamically  speaking, a propeller is a rotating airfoil and the same  principles that apply to the wing will apply to the pro­ peller. [Figure 3-17] Engine power is transferred to the  propeller through a rotating crankshaft that turns the  propeller through the air, producing thrust in the same  way as wings produce lift. The shape of the blade cre­ ates thrust vectors because it is cambered like the air­ foil of a wing. Consequently, as the air flows past the  propeller, the pressure on one side is less than that on  the other. As in a wing, this produces a reaction force  in the direction of the lower pressure. In the case of  the propeller, which is mounted in a vertical plane, the

Figure 3-17. Airfoil sections of a propeller blade.Airfoil sections of a propeller blade.Suspension system.  

area of decreased pressure is in front of the propeller,  and the force (thrust) is in a forward direction. Aero­ dynamically, the thrust is the result of the propeller  shape and the angle of attack of the blade.  

The typical powered parachute has a ground adjust­ able propeller. The adjustment of the propeller should  only be conducted to meet the engine manufacturer’s  maximum recommended RPM target. Pilots who are  not familiar with adjusting the propeller and how it  will affect the PPC performance should consult with  a knowledgeable source prior to making any propeller  adjustments.  

The engine mount is designed by individual manu­ facturers for each cart configuration. The majority of  the total aircraft weight is determined by the engine  and mounting configuration. When trailering the PPC  over bumpy terrain or over long trips, the bouncing  of the cart in the trailer can put extreme stress on this  mounting system. In addition, repeated hard land­ ings of the cart can also stress the welds of the engine  mount. Consistent detailed inspections of the engine  mount should be an important part of every preflight  and post-flight inspection.  

Just like an airplane propeller, the powered parachute  propeller turns at such great speeds that it becomes  invisible when in motion. The dangers of a turning  propeller require every pilot to maintain the highest  level of safety and respect for the consequences of  body parts, pets, and debris coming in contact with a  rotating propeller. Always treat the propeller as if the  ignition were on. Debris on the takeoff/landing field  is a danger to the propeller as well as to the people  who may be in the prop-wash area behind the pro­ peller. Stones, small pieces of metal, and sticks can  become dangerous projectiles if kicked into the pro­ peller during takeoff and landing. Just as with any  airframe or wing component of a powered parachute,  if the propeller becomes damaged, nicked or dinged,  the aircraft’s performance can be greatly affected.  

Some pilots elect to use tape or rock deflector guards  to protect the leading edge from rock/debris damage.  Regardless, taking proper care of the PPC propeller is  as critical as proper engine and wing care.  

# Axle and Wheel Assembly  

The rear and front wheels of the powered parachute  are an assembly and consist of a tire, a rim, and an  inner and outer set of wheel bearings. The wheel is  secured on a spindle and held in place by a nut and  a cotter pin. Each spindle is typically mounted on a  suspension system which provides elasticity and at  the same time is very strong. [Figure 3-18] The sus­ pension system varies by manufacturer from one cart  to another; refer to the POH for exact configuration  and components. Some powered parachute tires are  heavily treaded while others are smooth; pilot prefer­ ence and the terrain type are determining factors in  choice of tire profiles. [Figure 3-19] Tire sealant or  thorn guards can be used to minimize flat tires.

This chapter covers the engines found on most pow­ ered parachutes and includes the exhaust, ignition,  fuel, lubrication, cooling, propeller, gearbox, induc­ tion, charging, and fuel systems. Reciprocating en­ gine operating theory is covered, for both two-stroke  and four-stroke engines.  

The powered parachute engine and propeller, often  referred to as a powerplant, work in combination to  produce thrust. The powerplant propels the powered  parachute and charges the electrical system that sup­ ports PPC operation.  

The engine is one of the key components of a powered  parachute and should be maintained according to both  the engine and airframe manufacturer recommenda­ tions. Preflight information, along with maintenance  schedules and procedures, can be found in the  Pilot’s  Operating Handbook  (POH) and/or maintenance ref­ erences from the manufacturers.  

Engine inspections and maintenance must be per­ formed and documented in a logbook. You should  review this logbook before flying an unfamiliar pow­ ered parachute.  

# Reciprocating Engines  

Most powered parachutes are designed with recipro­ cating engines. Two common means of classifying  reciprocating engines are:  

1.	By the number of piston strokes needed to	 complete a cycle: two-stroke or four-stroke; and

 	 2.	By the method of cooling: liquid or air-cooled.  

Refer to Chapter 5 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aero­ nautical Knowledge  for a comprehensive review of  how reciprocating four-stroke engines operate.  

# Two-Stroke Engines  

Two-stroke engines are commonly used in powered  parachutes. Two-stroke aviation engines evolved  from two-stroke snowmobile and watercraft engines,  the difference being that an aircraft engine is opti­ mized for reliability with dual ignition often installed  for each cylinder. Two-stroke engines are popular be­ cause they have fewer components than four-stroke  engines which makes them less expensive to manu­ facture, and lighter, thus increasing their power-to- weight ratio.  

Two-stroke engines require that oil be mixed into the  fuel to lubricate the engine, instead of being held in a  sump and having a separate recirculating system like  a four-stroke engine. Details on two-stroke oil mixing  are covered later under the “Lubrication” section.  

One stroke as the piston moves up is  intake  and  com­ pression , the second stroke as the piston moves down  is  power  and  exhaust . The two-stroke engine per­ forms the same functions as a four-stroke engine in  half the strokes.  

A wide range of valve systems are found on two  cycle engines, for the purpose of opening and clos­ ing ports in the cylinder to let fuel in and exhaust out  at the proper time, similar to the intake and exhaust  valves on a four-stroke engine.  One-way pressure  valves , called spring, reed, or poppet valves, open  when the pressure drops within the crankcase, pull­ ing the fuel from the carburetor into the crankcase.  [Figure 4-1]  

Mechanical rotary valves  are driven off the engine,  rotate to provide an opening at the precise time, and  can be on the intake and exhaust ports. [Figure 4-2]  

Piston porting does not use any valves. The fuel inlet  port is opened and closed by the piston position as  it moves up and down in the cylinder. This is called  a “piston ported inlet” and will be used in the Two- Stroke Process description that follows. [Figure 4-3]  

# Two-Stroke Process  

The two-stroke process begins with the fuel enter­ ing the engine and concludes as it exits as exhaust.  [Figure 4-3]Chapter 4—Powerplants  

![](images/6fea4a251f35bef5f2b4924e65ff14f089414abcd6a903131d4db76b69da8675.jpg)  
Figure 4-1. Reed valve is open with low pressure and closes when the pressure increases.  

# Crankcase Vacuum Intake Stroke—Piston 
 Moving up: Figure 4-3 a to b  

The upward stroke of the piston [Figure 4-3a] cre­ ates a vacuum in the crankcase and pulls the fuel/ air/oil mixture into the crankcase through the intake  valve system from the carburetor. [Figure 4-3b] This  can be a pressure-actuated reed valve, a rotary valve,  or a third ported inlet system where the lower piston  skirt provides an opening for the fuel/air/oil mixture  to flow in when the piston is reaching its highest  point Top Dead Center (TDC). At this point, the  greatest portion of the fuel/air/oil mixture has filled  the crankcase.  

# Crankcase Compression Stroke—Piston 
 Moving down: Figure 4-3 b to c  

During the downward stroke, the pressure valve is  forced closed by the increased crankcase pressure,  the mechanical rotary valve closes, or the piston  closes off the fuel/air oil mixture intake port. The  fuel mixture is then compressed in the crankcase  during the downward stroke of the piston.  

# Crankcase Transfer/Exhaust—Piston at lowest:  Figure 4-3 d  

When the piston is near the bottom of its stroke, the  transfer port opening from the crankcase to the com­ bustion chamber is exposed, and the high pressure  fuel/air mixture in the crankcase transfers around the  piston into the main cylinder.  

![](images/5f1adbbe7b41a74c8e16485a531932825971817450d8c93908e276a1e0603574.jpg)

and the exhaust port is open. Some of the fresh fuel/ air/oil mixture can escape out the exhaust port result­ ing in the higher fuel use of the two stroke engine.  

# Cylinder start of Compression Stroke—Piston  initially Moving up: Figure 4-3 e  

As the piston starts to move up, covering the transfer  port, the tuned exhaust bounces a pressure wave at  the precise time across the exhaust port (more on  this in the exhaust system discussion) to minimize Reed valve is open with low pressure and closes when the pressure increases.Intake rotary valve for a two cycle engine.  

This fresh fuel/air/oil mixture pushes out the exhaust  (called scavenging) as the piston is at its lowest point

the fuel/air/oil mixture from escaping out the ex­ haust port.  

# Cylinder Compression Stroke—Piston Moving  Up: Figure 4-3 e to f  

The piston then rises, and compresses the fuel mix­ ture in the combustion chamber. During this piston  compression process, the crankcase vacuum intake  process is happening simultaneously, as described  earlier. This is why four processes can happen in two  strokes.  

# Cylinder Power Stroke—Piston Moving Down: 
 Figure 4-3 f to g  

At the top of the stroke, the spark plug ignites the  fuel mixture and drives the piston down as the power  stroke of the engine.  

# Cylinder Power Stroke—Piston Moving Down: 
 Figure  $\mathbf{4}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{3}\;\mathbf{g}$   to h  

As the piston passes the exhaust port, the exhaust  starts to exit the combustion chamber. As the pis­ ton continues down, the transfer port opens and the  swirling motion of the air/fuel/oil mixture pushes the  exhaust out the exhaust port.  

# Piston Reverses Direction From Down Stroke to  Up Stroke: Figure  $\mathbf{4}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{3}\;\mathbf{h}$   to a  

As the piston reverses direction from the down  stroke to the up stroke the process is complete.

# Four-Stroke Engines  

Four-stroke engines are very common in most air­ craft categories, and are becoming more common in  powered parachutes. [Figure 4-4] Four-stroke engines  have a number of advantages, including reliability,  fuel economy, longer engine life, and higher horse­ power ranges.  

These advantages are countered by a higher acquisi­ tion cost, lower power-to-weight ratios, and a higher  overall weight. The increased weight and cost are  the result of additional components, e.g., camshaft,  valves, complex head to house the valve train, etc.,  incorporated in a four-stoke engine.  

# Exhaust Systems  

Engine exhaust systems vent the burned combustion  gases overboard, reduce engine noise, and (in the  case of two-stroke engines) help keep the fresh fuel- air mixture in the cylinders. An exhaust system has  exhaust piping attached to the cylinders, as well as  a muffler. The exhaust gases are pushed out of the  cylinder and through the exhaust pipe system to the  atmosphere.  

Some exhaust systems have an exhaust gas tempera­ ture probe. This probe transmits an electric signal to  an instrument in front of the pilot. This instrument  reads the signal and provides the exhaust gas tempera­ ture (EGT) of the gases at the exhaust manifold. This  temperature varies with power and with the mixture  (ratio of fuel to air entering the cylinders), and is used  to make sure the fuel-air mixture is within specifica­ tions. When there is a problem with carburetion, the  EGT gauge will normally be the first notification for  a pilot.  

# Two-Stroke Tuned Exhaust Systems  

In two-stroke engines, the exhaust system increases  the fuel economy and power of the engine. The two- stroke exhaust system is an integral part of any two- stroke engine design; often controlling peak power  output, the torque curve, and even the RPM limit of  the engine.  

The exhaust system must be tuned to produce a back  pressure wave to act as an exhaust valve. When hot  spent gases are vented out of the exhaust port, they are  moving fast enough to set up a high-pressure wave.  The momentum of that wave down the exhaust pipe  diffuser lowers the pressure behind it. That low pres­ sure is used to help suck out all of the residual, hot,  burnt gas from the power stroke and at the same time  help pull a fresh fuel-air charge into the cylinder. This  is called scavenging and is an important function of a  tuned two-stroke exhaust system.  

The design of the exhaust converging section causes  a returning pressure wave to push the fresh fuel-air  charge back into the exhaust port before the cylinder  closes off that port. That is called pulse-charging and  is another important function of the exhaust system.  

Tuned exhaust systems are typically tuned to a par­ ticular RPM range. The more a certain RPM range  is emphasized, the less effective the engine will op­ erate at other RPMs. Vehicles like motorcycles take  advantage of this with the use of transmissions. Mo­ torcycle exhaust pipe builders can optimize a certain  RPM range and then the driver shifts gears to stay in  that range. Aircraft, with no transmission, do not have  this ability.  

On an aircraft, an exhaust pipe has to be designed to  operate over a broad range of RPMs from idle to full  speed. This is part of the reason that simply putting a  snowmobile engine on a powered parachute doesn’t  work well.  

Overall, the two-stroke exhaust system for a PPC is  a specific design and must be matched to the engine  to operate properly and obtain the rated power. It also  reduces noise and directs the exhaust to an appropri­ ate location. Exhaust silencers can be added to reduce  noise but additional weight, cost, and slight power re­ duction are the byproducts.  

# Four-Stroke Engine Exhaust Systems  

Four-stroke engines are not as sensitive as two-stroke  engines because they have exhaust valves and there­ fore do not need the precision pulse tuned exhaust sys­ tem. However, directing the exhaust out appropriately  and reducing the noise are important considerations.  Again, using the manufacturer’s recommended con­ figurations is required for Special Light Sport Aircraft  (S-LSA) and recommended for Experimental Light  Sport Aircraft (E-LSA).  

# Two-Stroke Engine Warming  

Two-stroke engines must be warmed up because met­ als expand at different rates as they heat up. If you  heat up steel and aluminum, you will find that the alu­ minum parts expand faster than the steel parts. This  becomes a problem in two different areas of many  two-stroke engines. The first place is in the cylinders  of the engine.  

The cylinders have steel cylinder walls that expand  slowly compared to aluminum pistons that expand  quickly. If an engine is revved too quickly during  takeoff before warming up, a lot of heat is generated  on top of the piston. That quickly expands the piston,  which can then seize in the cylinder. A piston seizure  will stop the engine abruptly.  

The second area of concern is lower in the engine  around the engine crankshaft. This is an area where  things may get too loose with heat, rather than seizing  up. Additionally, the crankcase has steel bearings set  into the aluminum which need to expand together or  the bearings could slip.  

Many two-stroke engines have steel bearings that nor­ mally hug the walls of the aluminum engine case. The  crank spins within the donuts of those steel bearings.  If you heat up the engine two quickly, the aluminum  case will out-expand those steel bearings and the  crank will cause the bearings to start spinning along  with it. If those steel bearings start spinning, they can  ruin the soft aluminum walls of the case, which is  very expensive.  

If heat is slowly added to an engine, all the parts will  expand more evenly. This is done through a proper  warm-up procedure. Many two-stroke engines are  best warmed up by running the engine at a set RPM  for a set amount of time. Follow the instructions in  your POH; however, a good rule of thumb is to ini­ tially start the engine at idle RPM, get it operating  smoothly, and then warm the engine at 3,000 RPM  for 5 minutes.  

Once the engine is warmed up and the powered para­ chute is flying, it is still possible to cool down the  engine too much. This will happen when the engine is  idled back for an extended period of time. Even though  the engine is running, it is not generating as much heat  as the cooling system is efficiently dumping into the  atmosphere. An immediate power application with a  cooled engine can seize the engine just as if the engine  had not been warmed in the first place.  

In water-cooled engines, on a long descent at idle, the  coolant cools until the thermostat closes and the en­ gine is not circulating the radiator fluid through the  engine. The engine temperature remains at this ther­ mostat closed temperature while the radiator coolant  continues to cool further. If full throttle is applied, the  thermostat can open allowing a blast of coolant into  the warm engine. The piston is expanding because of  the added heat and the cylinder is cooling with the  cold radiator water resulting in a piston seizure. To  prevent this, slowly add power well before you get  close to the ground where you will need power. This  will give the system a chance to gradually open the  thermostat and warm up the radiator water.  

Just as it takes a while for the engine crankcase and  bearings to warm up, it also takes those steel parts a  long time to cool down. If you land, refuel and want  to take off again quickly, there is no need to warm up  again for 5 minutes. The lower end of the engine will  stay warmed up after being shut down for short peri­ ods. An engine restart is an example where it would  be appropriate to warm the engine up until the gauges  reach operating temperatures. The lower end of the  engine is warm and now you only need to be con­ cerned with preventing the pistons from seizing.  

# Four-Stroke Engine Warming  

A four-stroke engine must also be warmed up. The  four-stroke engine has a pressurized oil system that  provides more uniform engine temperatures to all its  components. You can apply takeoff power as soon  as the water, cylinder head temperature (CHT), oil  temperatures and oil pressure are within the manu­ facturer’s recommended tolerances for takeoff power  applications.  

# Gearboxes  

Gearboxes are used on all powered parachute recip­ rocating engines to take the rotational output of an  internal combustion engine which is turning at a very  high RPM and convert it to a slower (and more useful)  RPM to turn the propeller. Gearboxes come in differ­ ent gear ratios depending on the output speed of the  engine and the needed propeller turning speeds.  

A typical two-stroke RPM reduction is from 6,500  engine RPM with a 3.47 to 1 reduction, resulting in  1,873 propeller RPM. A typical four-stroke RPM re­ duction is from 5,500 engine RPM with a 2.43 to 1  reduction, resulting in 2,263 propeller RPM.  

A gearbox is a simple device that bolts directly to the  engine and in turn has the propeller bolted directly  to it.  

A two-cycle engine gearbox is kept lubricated with  its own built-in reservoir of heavy gearbox oil. The  reservoir is actually part of the gearbox case itself.  The gearbox oil has to be changed periodically since  the meshing of the gears will cause them to wear and  will deposit steel filings into the oil. If the oil is not  changed, the filings themselves are abrasive and will  cause even more wear.  

Some gearboxes have the electric starter motor built  into it. When activated, the motor turns the gearing,  which in turn cranks the engine itself.  

Four-stroke propeller reduction gearboxes use oil  from the engine oil system for lubrication.  

# Centrifugal Clutch  

Some gearboxes come with a built-in centrifugal  clutch, and others have allowances for installation. A  centrifugal clutch is very useful in a two-stroke engine  because it allows the engine to idle at a lower speed  without the load of the propeller. Otherwise, two- strokes can generate a lot of vibration at low RPM  when loaded. As the engine speeds up, the centrifugal  clutch engages the rest of the gearbox and smooth­ ly starts the propeller spinning. When the engine is  brought back to idle, the clutch disengages and allows  the engine to again idle smoothly; the propeller stops  when on the ground and windmills when flying.  

# Propeller  

The propeller provides the necessary thrust to push  the powered parachute through the air. The engine  power is used to rotate the propeller, which in turn  generates thrust very similar to the manner in which  a wing produces lift. The amount of thrust produced  depends on the airfoil shape, the propeller blade angle  of attack, and the engine RPM. [Figure 4-5] Powered  parachutes are equipped with either a fixed-pitch or  ground adjustable pitch propeller.  

# Fixed-Pitch Propeller  

The pitch of this propeller is set by the manufactur­ er and cannot be changed. Refer to Chapter 5 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  for ba­ sic propeller principles.  

# Ground Adjustable-Pitch Propeller  

Adjustable-pitch propellers for PPCs can only be ad­ justed on the ground with hand tools. If an engine is  over-revving, more pitch can be added to the propeller.  If the engine is not developing the full recommended  RPM during flight, then some pitch can be taken out  of the blades. This should be done per the PPC’s POH  and by a qualified technician.  

# Induction Systems  

The induction system brings air in from the atmo­ sphere, mixes it with fuel, and delivers the fuel-air  

![](images/4f76ff525dc1bfc9fa705eeac9c16b43ac3a37a5ab65a02857e81f1663f0cc43.jpg)

mixture to the cylinder where combustion occurs.  Outside air enters the induction system through an air  filter on the engine. The air filter inhibits the entry of  dust and other foreign objects. Two types of induction  systems are used in powered parachute engines:  

1. The carburetor system is most common; it mixes 	 the fuel and air in the carburetor before this  mixture enters the engine intake, and

 	 2. The fuel injection system, which injects the fuel  into the air just before entry into each cylinder.  

# Carburetor Systems  

PPCs use float-type carburetors. Reference the  Pilot’s  Operating Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  for  basics on float carburetor operation.  

Modern two- and four-stroke carburetors operate with  one of three jetting systems, depending on engine  power. [Figure 4-6]  

When the throttle is closed, for engine idling, the throt­ tle valve is closed and the fuel is supplied through the  idle (pilot) jet and idle (pilot) air passage. The fuel/Engine RPM is indicated on the gauge.  

![](images/e7063f345c052408ee76185635a425dc278d01b2983ea92d94660b82e7b5b270.jpg)  
Figure 4-6. Throttle position and jetting system used.Typical 2-stroke carburetor.  

air/oil mixture is supplied to the cylinders through the  bypass hole. [Figure 4-7]  

As the throttle is advanced and the throttle valve is  raised, the fuel is sucked up through the main jet but  is controlled by the opening and taper of the jet nee­ dle and needle jet. This is effective throughout most  of the mid range operation. About half throttle, the  main jet size starts to influence the amount of fuel  mixed with the air and this effect continues until it  is the main influence at the highest throttle settings.  [Figure 4-8]  

# Two-Stroke Carburetor Jetting  

Carburetors are normally set at sea-level pressure,  with the jets and settings determined by the manufac­ turer. [Figure 4-9] However, as altitude increases, the

Figure 4-8.  Jet needle/needle jet and main jet system.  

density of air entering the carburetor decreases, while  the density of the fuel remains the same. This creates  a progressively richer mixture, same fuel but less air,  which can result in engine roughness and an appre­ ciable loss of power. The roughness is usually due to  spark plug fouling from excessive carbon buildup on  the plugs. Carbon buildup occurs because the exces­ sively rich mixture lowers the temperature inside the  cylinder, inhibiting complete combustion of the fuel.  This condition may occur at high-elevation airports and  during climbs or cruise flight at high altitudes. To main­ tain the correct fuel-air mixture, you can change the  main jets and the midrange jets setting for base opera­ tions at a high density altitude airport. Operating from  low altitude airports and climbing to altitude where the  mixture becomes rich for short periods is OK. Throttle position and jetting system used.  

Operating an aircraft at a lower altitude airport with  the jets set for higher altitudes will create too lean of  a mixture, heat up the engine, and cause the engine  to seize. The pilot must be aware of the jetting for  the machine to adjust the mixture. Consult your POH  for specific procedures for setting jets at different al­ titudes.  

# Four-Stroke Mixture Settings  

Four-stroke engines typically have automatic mixture  control for higher altitudes or a mixture control that  can be operated by the pilot.  

# Carburetor Icing  

One disadvantage of the carburetor system versus the  fuel injected system is its icing tendency. Carbure­ tor ice occurs due to the effect of fuel vaporization  and the decrease in air pressure in the venturi, which  causes a sharp temperature drop in the carburetor. If  water vapor in the air condenses when the carbure­ tor temperature is at or below freezing, ice may form  on internal surfaces of the carburetor, including the  throttle valve.  

Ice generally forms in the vicinity of the venturi throat.  This restricts the flow of the fuel-air mixture and re­ duces power. If enough ice builds up, the engine may  cease to operate. Carburetor ice is most likely to oc­ cur when temperatures are below  $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $(21^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   and the  relative humidity is above 80 percent. However, due  to the sudden cooling that takes place in the carbure­ tor, icing can occur even with temperatures as high  as   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $(38^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$   and humidity as low as 50 percent.  This temperature drop can be as much as 60 to   $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  Therefore, at an outside air temperature of   $100^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , a  temperature drop of   $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   results in an air temperature  in the carburetor of   $30^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . [Figure 4-10]Although carburetor ice is most likely to form when the temperature and humidity are in ranges indicated by this chart, carburetor ice is also possible under conditions not depicted.  

![](images/49b11fe38fd02f7ced61ae35ff7d4246cee1702809e49a132e8d69f86bce77e8.jpg)  
Figure 4-10. Although carburetor ice is most likely to  form when the temperature and humidity are in ranges  indicated by this chart, carburetor ice is also possible  under conditions not depicted. Fuel injection system.  

The first indication of carburetor icing in a powered  parachute is a decrease in engine RPM, which may be  followed by engine roughness. Although carburetor  ice can occur during any phase of flight, it is particu­ larly dangerous when using reduced power during a  descent. Under certain conditions, carburetor ice could  build unnoticed until you try to add power. To combat  the effects of carburetor ice, some engines have a carb  heat option. Some of the newer four-stroke engines  have carburetor heat turned on all the time to combat  icing. Two-stroke engines are typically less suscep­ tible to icing but specific installations dictate how sus­ ceptible the carburetor is to icing. Consult the aircraft  POH for the probability of carb ice for the specific  installation you have and for carb ice procedures.  

# Fuel Injection Systems  

In a fuel injection system, the fuel is injected either  directly into the cylinders, or just ahead of the intake  valve. A fuel injection system usually incorporates  these basic components: an engine-driven fuel pump,  a fuel-air control unit, fuel manifold (fuel distributor),  discharge nozzles, an auxiliary fuel pump, and fuel  pressure/flow indicators. [Figure 4-11]  

The auxiliary fuel pump provides fuel under pressure  to the fuel-air control unit for engine starting and/or  emergency use. After starting, the engine-driven fuel  pump provides fuel under pressure from the fuel tank  to the fuel-air control unit. This control unit, which  essentially replaces the carburetor, meters the fuel and  sends it to the fuel manifold valve at a rate controlled  by the throttle. After reaching the fuel manifold valve,  the fuel is distributed to the individual fuel discharge  nozzles. The discharge nozzles, which are located in  each cylinder head, inject the fuel-air mixture directly  into each cylinder intake port.  

![](images/72b2aeaa548fed62b06b47a64f6a7d85a08e49dcd491a0ce7aa8c830850639ee.jpg)  
Figure 4-11. Fuel injection system.  

Some of the advantages of fuel injection are:  

•	 No carburetor icing. • 	Better fuel flow. • 	Faster throttle response. • 	Precise control of mixture. • 	Better fuel distribution. • 	Easier cold weather starts.  

Disadvantages include:  

• 	Difficulty in starting a hot engine. • 	Vapor locks during ground operations on hot  days. • 	Problems associated with restarting an engine  that quits because of fuel starvation.  

# Ignition System  

The ignition system provides the spark that ignites the  fuel-air mixture in the cylinders. Components include  a magneto generator, an electronic control box that  replaces mechanical points, spark plugs, high-voltage  leads and the ignition switch(es). Individual manu­ facturer designs will vary and pilots must be familiar  with the aircraft operating procedures for the PPC be­ ing flown.  

A magneto uses a permanent magnet to generate an  electrical current independent of the aircraft’s elec­ trical system which might include a battery. The air­ craft electrical system can fail—the battery can go  dead—however, this has no effect on the ignition sys­ tem which uses a separate generator in the magneto.  The electricity from the separate ignition coil on the  magneto generator goes into the ignition control box  where the correct voltage is produced and timed to  fire the spark plugs at the proper time. The magneto  also sends a signal to the electric control box to pro­ vide the timing signal to fire the spark plugs.  

Most modern PPCs use an electronic timing system  instead of the mechanical points inside the old magne­ tos which also housed the points. Capacitor discharge  ignition (CDI) systems are a common example of an  electronic ignition system. Electronic ignition sys­ tems operate without any moving parts to increase  reliability and efficiency. A CDI system begins to fire  when the starter is engaged and the crankshaft begins  to turn. It continues to operate whenever the crank­ shaft is rotating.  

Most powered parachutes incorporate a dual ignition  system with two individual coil systems in the mag­ neto, two individual electronic ignition timing sys­ tems (electric box), two separate sets of wires, and  two spark plugs per cylinder. Dual ignition systems  increase overall reliability of the engine. Each igni­ tion system operates independently to fire one of the  two spark plugs. If one ignition system fails, the other  is unaffected. The engine will continue to operate nor­ mally, although you can expect a slight decrease in  engine power.  

The operation of the ignition system is controlled in  the cockpit by the ignition switch(es). Since there are  two individual ignition systems, there are normally  two separate ignition toggle switches.  

You can identify a malfunctioning ignition system  during the pretakeoff check by observing the decrease  in RPM that occurs when you first turn off one igni­ tion switch, turn it back on, and then turn off the other.  A noticeable decrease in engine RPM is normal dur­ ing this check. If the engine stops running when you  switch to one ignition system or if the RPM drop ex­ ceeds the allowable limit, do not fly the powered para­ chute until the problem is corrected. The cause could  be fouled plugs, broken or shorted wires between the  magneto and the plugs, or improperly timed firing of  the plugs because of the control box.  

It should be noted that “no drop” in RPM is not nor­ mal, and in that instance, the powered parachute  should not be flown. Following engine shutdown,  keep the ignition switches in the OFF position. Even  with the battery and master switches OFF, the engine  can fire and turn over if you leave an ignition switch  ON and the propeller is moved because the ignition  system requires no outside source of electrical power.  The potential for serious injury in this situation is ob­ vious.  

# Combustion  

During normal combustion, the fuel-air mixture burns  in a very controlled and predictable manner. Although  the process occurs in a fraction of a second, the mix­ ture actually begins to burn at the point where it is  ignited by the spark plugs, then burns away from the  plugs until it is consumed completely. This type of  combustion causes a smooth buildup of temperature  and pressure and ensures that the expanding gases de­ liver the maximum force to the piston at exactly the  right time in the power stroke.  

Detonation is an uncontrolled, explosive ignition of  the fuel-air mixture within the cylinder’s combustion  chamber. It causes excessive temperatures and pres­ sures which, if not corrected, can quickly lead to fail­ ure of the piston, cylinder, or valves. In less severe  cases, detonation causes engine overheating, rough­ ness, or loss of power.  

Detonation is characterized by high cylinder head  temperatures, and is most likely to occur when operat­ ing at high power settings. Some common operational  causes of detonation include:  

•	 Using a lower fuel grade than that specified  by the aircraft manufacturer or operating the  engine after it has been sitting for an extended  period; after 3 weeks or as indicated by  your POH you should drain old fuel out and  replenish with fresh fuel. •	 Operating the engine at high power settings  with an excessively lean mixture. •	 Detonation also can be caused by extended  ground operations.  

Detonation may be avoided by following these basic  guidelines during the various phases of ground and  flight operations:  

•	 Make sure the proper grade of fuel is being  used. Drain and refuel if the fuel is old.  • 	Develop a habit of monitoring the engine  instruments to verify proper operation according  to procedures established by the manufacturer.  

Preignition occurs when the fuel-air mixture ignites  prior to the engine’s normal ignition event. Premature  burning is usually caused by a residual hot spot in the  combustion chamber, often created by a small carbon  deposit on a spark plug, a cracked spark plug insula­ tor, or other damage in the cylinder that causes a part  to heat sufficiently to ignite the fuel-air charge. Preig­ nition causes the engine to lose power, and produces  high operating temperature. As with detonation, pre­ ignition may also cause severe engine damage, be­ cause the expanding gases exert excessive pressure on  the piston while still on its compression stroke.  

Detonation and preignition often occur simultaneous­ ly and one may cause the other. Since either condition  causes high engine temperature accompanied by a  decrease in engine performance, it is often difficult to  distinguish between the two. Using the recommended  grade of fuel and operating the engine within its prop­ er temperature and RPM ranges reduce the chance of  detonation or preignition.  

# Fuel Systems  

The fuel system is designed to provide an uninterrupt­ ed flow of clean fuel from the fuel tank to the engine.  See Chapter 3 for more information on fuel tanks. The

Figure 4-12. Fuel pump system.  

fuel must be available to the engine under all condi­ tions of engine power, altitude, attitude, and during all  approved flight maneuvers. [Figure 4-12]  

# Fuel Pumps  

Powered parachutes have fuel pump systems. The  main pump system is engine-driven and sometimes an  electrically-driven auxiliary pump is provided for use  in engine starting and in the event the engine pump  fails. The auxiliary pump, also known as a boost  pump, provides added reliability to the fuel system.  The electrically-driven auxiliary pump is controlled  by a switch in the cockpit.  

A diaphragm pump is the primary pump in the fuel  system for two-stroke engines. Air pulses in the  crankcase actuate a diaphragm and provide fuel under  pressure to the carburetor. Four-stroke engines have a  mechanical pump driven directly off the engine.  

# Fuel Plunger Primer  

The fuel plunger primer is used to draw fuel from the  tanks to supply it directly into the cylinders prior to  starting the engine. This is particularly helpful during  cold weather when engines are hard to start because  there is not enough heat available to vaporize the fuel  in the carburetor. For some powered parachutes, it is  the only way to deliver fuel to the engine when first  starting. After the engine starts and is running, the  fuel pump pushes fuel to the carburetors and begins Fuel pump system.  

normal fuel delivery. To avoid overpriming, read the  priming instructions in your POH for your powered  parachute.  

# Choke  

A choke or fuel enrichening system is an alternate  method to provide additional fuel to the engine for  initial cold starting. Actuating the choke control al­ lows more fuel to flow into the carburetor.  

# Fuel Bulb Primer  

The fuel bulb primer is manually actuated by squeez­ ing the bulb to draw fuel from the tanks. This charges  the fuel lines and carburetor float bowls before start­ ing the engine the first time on a given day. After the  engine starts, the fuel pump is able to deliver the fuel  to the fuel bowls.  

# Fuel Gauges  

The fuel quantity gauge indicates the amount of fuel  measured by a sensing unit in each fuel tank and is  displayed in gallons. Do not depend solely on the ac­ curacy of the fuel quantity gauge. Always visually  check the fuel level in the tank during the preflight in­ spection, and then compare it with the corresponding  fuel quantity indication. It is also important to track  your inflight fuel consumption. Be sure to consult the  POH for your powered parachute and know the ap­ proximate consumption rate to ensure sufficient fuel  for your flight.  

If an auxiliary electric fuel pump is installed in the  fuel system, a fuel pressure gauge is sometimes in­ cluded. This gauge indicates the pressure in the fuel  lines. The normal operating pressure can be found in  the POH.  

# Fuel Filter  

After leaving the fuel tank, the fuel passes through a  filter before it enters the fuel pump or carburetor. This  filter removes sediments that might be in the fuel.  

# Fuel  

Aviation gasoline, or AVGAS, is identified by an oc­ tane or performance number (grade), which designates  the antiknock value or knock resistance of the fuel  mixture in the engine cylinder. The higher the grade  of gasoline, the more pressure the fuel can withstand  without detonating. Lower grades of fuel are used in  lower-compression engines because these fuels ig­ nite at a lower temperature. Higher grades are used  in higher-compression engines, because they must  ignite at higher temperatures, but not prematurely. If  the proper grade of fuel is not available, use the next  higher grade as a substitute. Never use a lower grade.  This can cause the cylinder head temperature to ex­ ceed its normal operating range, which may result in  detonation.  

Unfortunately, aviation gasoline or AVGAS 100LL is  not recommended by at least one of the major two- stroke engine manufacturers. Even though the “LL”  stands for “Low Lead,” 100LL contains more lead  than the old premium leaded gas dispensed at auto­ motive filling stations. The lead in the fuel leaves de­ posits in the piston ring grooves, freezing the rings in  position and reducing engine performance.  

Spark plugs are also very susceptible to lead foul­ ing. This is especially true in two-stroke engines that  use cooler ignition temperatures than standard aircraft  engines.  

AVGAS does have some advantages. It degrades  slower than regular gas, maintaining its efficiency for  a full 3 months. AVGAS 100LL has no seasonal or  regional variations and is manufactured according to  a standardized “recipe” worldwide.  

If the airport has only 100LL available, it is permis­ sible, absent any limitations of the engine manufac­ turer, to mix 100LL and 89 octane gasoline, for use  in two-stroke engines. A 50-50 ratio will boost the  octane rating and limit the amount of lead available  for fouling. Generally speaking, this is a reasonable  compromise when 89 octane is not available.  

Two-stroke engine manufacturers, and four-storke  engines used on powered parachutes, typically rec­ ommend the use of 89 octane minimum auto fuel for  their engines. Additives are put into auto gas primar­ ily to reduce harmful emissions rather than boost per­ formance. The additives are supposed to be listed at  the pump, but the accuracy of this posting should be  questioned.  

Methanol alcohol has corrosive properties and can  damage engines. Engine manufacturers do not recom­ mend more that 3 percent methanol in fuel. Consult  the POH for specifics on your engine.  

Ethanol alcohol is less corrosive than methanol. How­ ever, it attracts water and is not as economical as gas­ oline.Ethanol does not get very good fuel economy.  Avoid fuels with any more than 10 percent of ethanol  in it. Consult your POH for specifics on your engine.  

Manufacturers provide specific recommendations for  the percentage of alcohol in fuel. The posting on the  pump may not be accurate and alcohol content can  vary greatly between fuel brands and stations. Addi­ tionally, higher percentages of alcohol will be added  to auto gas in the future. A simple test can be con­ ducted to measure the fuel’s alcohol content to ensure  the fuel you use stays within the manufacturer’s rec­ ommendations.  

Use a general aviation sump collector, which includes  graduation marks. Add water to a specific mark. Then  add fuel to fill the collector up to the line for gas. Cov­ er the top and shake it vigorously. After it settles, the  water and alcohol will combine and it will look like  there is now more water in the sump collector. The  difference between the initial amount of water you  first put into the collector and the new level of com­ bined water and alcohol equals the amount of alcohol  in the fuel. Compare this amount of alcohol and the  amount of fuel to determine the percentage of alcohol  content in the fuel.  

Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) does not have  the corrosive or water attractive properties of the  previously mentioned additives and is added to fuel  to improve air quality. It has been banned in several  states because it is carcinogenic and has been found  in groundwater. It does not attract water, but it is ex­ pensive, so you will find it only in some of the better  grade fuels.  

# Fuel Contamination  

Clean fuel is imperative for the safe operation of a  PPC. Of the accidents attributed to powerplant failure  from fuel contamination, most have been traced to:  

• 	Failure to remove contamination from the fuel  system during preflight. • 	Servicing aircraft with improperly filtered fuel  from small tanks or drums. • 	Storing aircraft with partially filled fuel tanks. • 	Lack of proper maintenance.  

Rust is common in metal fuel containers and is a com­ mon fuel contaminant. Metal fuel tanks should be  filled after each flight, or at least after the last flight of  the day to prevent moisture condensation within the  tank. Another way to prevent fuel contamination is  to avoid refueling from cans and drums. Use a water  filtering funnel or a funnel with a chamois skin when  refueling from cans or drums. However, the use of a  chamois will not always ensure decontaminated fuel.  Worn-out chamois will not filter water; neither will a  new, clean chamois that is already water-wet or damp.  Most imitation chamois skins will not filter water.  

# Bad Gasoline  

Letting fuel sit for weeks without using it will cause  it to go bad. Even if gas does not go bad, it will often  lose its octane with time. For those that premix gaso­ line and two-stroke oil, there is another set of prob­ lems. Fuel and oil are normally mixed at a 50:1 ratio.  If premixed gas sits in a plastic container for a while,  the gas will evaporate out leaving a richer oil mixture  in the container. In any case, fresh gas should be used  as much as possible.  

# Refueling Procedures  

Never mix oil and fuel in an enclosed area. Not only  are the fumes irritating, but with the right fuel-air  mixture you can cause an explosion. Do all oil and  gas mixing outside. Refueling from fuel cans should  also be done outside. Never smoke while refueling.  

Be careful refueling an aircraft that has just landed.  There is the danger of spilling fuel on a hot engine com­ ponent, particularly an exhaust system component.  

Refueling should be done using only safety-approved  fuel containers. The fuel containers should be marked  with the type of fuel stored in them. Confusing pre­ mixed fuel and fuel that has no oil in it can be disas­ trous.  

There are advantages to both metal and plastic con­ tainers. Metal cans won’t allow the sun’s ultraviolet  rays in to harm the fuel. It also won’t develop static  charges like a plastic container may. However, a metal  can will be more prone to sweating when going from  cool to warm temperatures on humid days. Metal cans  and metal gas tanks are best kept either empty, or full  of fuel to leave no room for moist air.  

Plastic fuel containers are easy to handle, inexpen­ sive, available at discount stores, and do not scratch  the finish on airframes. Plastic cans also do not sweat,  so they don’t need to be stored topped off. However,  fuel does deteriorate a little faster in plastic. Also,  plastic containers can get charged with static electric­ ity while sliding around in the bed of a pickup truck,  especially if the truck has a plastic bed liner. Many  states now have laws prohibiting people from filling  plastic containers unless first placed on the ground.  

Static electricity can also be formed by the friction of  air passing over the surfaces of a powered parachute  in flight and by the flow of fuel through the hose and  nozzle during refueling, if fueling at a pump. Nylon,  Dacron, and wool clothing are especially prone to  accumulate and discharge static electricity from the  person to the funnel or nozzle. To guard against the  possibility of static electricity igniting fuel fumes, a  ground wire should be attached to the aircraft before  the fuel cap is removed from the tank. The refueling  nozzle should then be grounded to the aircraft be­ fore refueling is begun, and should remain grounded  throughout the refueling process.  

The passage of fuel through a chamois increases the  charge of static electricity and the danger of sparks.  The aircraft must be properly grounded and the noz­ zle, chamois filter, and funnel bonded to the aircraft.  If a can is used, it should be connected to either the  grounding post or the funnel. Cell phones should not  be used while refueling as they could pose a fire risk.  

# Mixing Two-Stroke Oil and Fuel  

Two-stroke engines require special two-stroke oil to  be mixed into the fuel before reaching the cylinder of  the engine. In some engines, an oil injection pump is  used to deliver the exact amount of oil into the intake  of the engine depending on the throttle setting. An ad­ vantage of an oil injection system is pilots don’t have  to premix any oil into the fuel. However, an important  preflight check is to make sure the two-stroke oil res­ ervoir is properly filled.  

If a two-stroke engine doesn’t have an oil injection  system, it is critical to mix oil into fuel before it is  put into the tank. Just pouring oil into the fuel tank  doesn’t give it the proper chance to mix with the gas  and makes it difficult to measure the proper amount of  oil for mixing. To mix two-stroke oil you should:  

• 	Find a clean, approved container. Pour a little  gas into it to help pre-dilute the two-stroke oil. • 	Pour in a known amount of two-stroke oil  into the container. Oil should be approved for  air-cooled engines at 50:1 mixing ratio (check  the engine manufacturer for proper fuel to oil  ratio for your PPC). Use a measuring cup if  necessary. Shake the oil-gas mixture around a  little to dilute the oil with gasoline. • 	Add gasoline until the 50:1 ratio is reached. If  you choose to use a water separating funnel,  make sure the funnel is grounded or at least in  contact with the fuel container. • 	Put the cap on the fuel can and shake the  gasoline and oil mixture thoroughly.  

# Starting System  

Most small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric  starter system. This system consists of a source of  electricity, wiring, switches, and solenoids to operate  the starter and a starter motor. The starter engages the  aircraft flywheel or the gearbox, rotating the engine  at a speed that allows the engine to start and maintain  operation.  

Electrical power for starting is usually supplied  by an on-board battery. When the battery switch is  turned on, electricity is supplied to the main power  bus through the battery solenoid. Both the starter and  the starter switch draw current from the main bus, but  the starter will not operate until the starting solenoid  is energized by the starter switch being turned to the  “start” position. When the starter switch is released  from the “start” position, the solenoid removes power  from the starter motor. The starter motor is protected  from being driven by the engine through a clutch in  the starter drive that allows the engine to run faster  than the starter motor.  

# Oil Systems  

In a four-stroke engine, the engine oil system per­ forms several important functions, including:  

•	 Lubrication of the engine’s moving parts. • 	Cooling of the engine by reducing friction. • 	Removing heat from the cylinders. • 	Providing a seal between the cylinder walls and  pistons. • 	Carrying away contaminants.  

Four-stroke engines use either a wet-sump or dry- sump oil system. Refer to Chapter 5 of the  Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  for more in­ formation on four-stroke oil systems.  

# Engine Cooling Systems  

The burning fuel within the cylinders produces in­ tense heat, most of which is expelled through the ex­ haust system. Much of the remaining heat, however,  must be removed, or at least dissipated, to prevent the  engine from overheating.  

While the oil system in a four-stroke engine and the  fuel-oil mix in a two-stroke engine is vital to the in­ ternal cooling of the engine, an additional method of  cooling is necessary for the engine’s external surface.  Powered parachute engines operate with either air- cooled or liquid-cooled systems.  

Many powered parachutes are equipped with a cylin­ der head temperature (CHT) gauge. This instrument  indicates a direct and immediate cylinder temperature  change. This instrument is calibrated in degrees Cel­ sius or Fahrenheit. Proper CHT ranges can be found  in the pilot’s operating handbook for that machine.  

Air cooling is accomplished by air being pulled into  the engine shroud by a cooling fan. Baffles route this  air over fins attached to the engine cylinders where  the air absorbs the engine heat. Expulsion of the hot  air takes place through one or more openings in the  shroud. If cylinder head temperatures rise too much in  an air cooled engine, it is because of lubrication prob­ lems: cooling fan drive belt damage or wear, or air  blockage in the cooling fins by a bird or insect nest.  

Liquid cooling systems pump coolant through jackets  in the cylinders and head. The heated liquid is then  routed to a radiator where the heat is radiated to the  atmosphere. The cooled liquid is then returned to the  engine. If the radiator is mounted low and close to the  propeller, the propeller can constantly move air across  the radiator and keep the engine cool even when the  powered parachute is not moving. Radiators mounted  high and away from the propeller raise the center of  gravity and make it more difficult for the radiator to  cool the engine unless the powered parachute is mov­ ing. Breaking in an engine through ground runs on a  hot day is when radiator placement is most critical.  

Liquid-cooled engines can overheat for a number of  reasons, such as coolant not at proper levels, a leak, a  failed water pump, or a blockage of the radiator. Op­ erating an engine above its maximum design tempera­ ture can cause a loss of power and detonation. It will  also lead to serious permanent damage, such as scor­ ing the cylinder walls and damaging the pistons and  rings. Monitor the engine temperature instruments to  avoid high operating temperature.  

Operating the engine lower than its designed tempera­ ture range can cause piston seizure and scarring on  the cylinder walls. This happens most often in liquid- cooled powered parachutes in cold weather where  large radiators designed for summer flying may need  to be partially blocked off.  

# Get Ready to Fly  

Your preflight preparations should include evaluating  the airworthiness of the:  

•	  P ilot: experience, sleep, food and water, drugs/ medications, stress, illness •	  A ircraft: fuel, weight (does not exceed  maximum), density altitude, takeoff and landing  requirements, equipment •	 En V ironment: weather conditions and forecast  for departure and destination airfields and route  of flight, runway lengths •	  E xternal pressures: schedules, available  alternatives, purpose of flight  

Often remembered as PAVE, it is important for you to  consider each of these factors and establish your own  personal minimums for flying.  

Once you determine the PAVE factors are favorable  for flight, you should obtain a weather briefing,  check  Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) and Terminal Flight  Restrictions (TFRs), plan your flight (determine the  departure and destination airfield and route of flight),  file a flight plan (if planning to fly cross-country), and  head to your aircraft and point of departure. The pow­ ered parachute (PPC) may be stored in a hangar, ga­ rage, or covered trailer­—any place out of the weather.  Begin with a visual inspection of the cart, then warm  up the engine. Push or taxi the PPC to the takeoff  point, shut down the engine, lay out and inspect the  wing.  Finally, strap into the PPC, start the engine, kite  the wing, and then continue the takeoff roll to lift off.  [Figure 5-1]  

# Trailering  

Trailers may be used to transport, store, and retrieve  powered parachutes. The PPC components should  fit snuggly without being forced, be guarded against  chafing, and be well secured within the trailer. Once Chapter 5—Preflight and Ground Operations  

![](images/74876e9f79b75a02e75cfd8a455a077cd596fe9487139141f47430cb5bd5cc72.jpg)  
Figure 5-1. Typical sequence for a preflight inspection. Use the preflight checklist in your POH for every flight.  

the loading is completed, take a short drive, stop, and  check for rubbing or chafing of components.  

Prior to taking the trailer on the road, inspect the  tires for proper inflation and adequate tread; check  all lights to make sure they are operating; ensure the  hitch is free moving and well lubricated; make sure  the vehicle attachment is rated for the weight of the  trailer; check the vehicle and trailer brake operation.  

When using a trailer, there are other precautions to  note. First, avoid towing with too much or too little  tongue weight as this causes the trailer to fishtail at  certain speeds, and it may become uncontrollable.  Second, take care when unloading the PPC to avoid  damage.  

# Where to Fly  

The powered parachute can be transported by trailer  from one flying field to the next. For as many benefits  as this provides, transporting the powered parachute  into unfamiliar territory also includes some safety and  operational issues.  

Make contact with the airport management to inquire  about any special arrangements that may need to be  made prior to departing from an unfamiliar airport.  Check the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) for traf­ fic pattern information, no fly zones surrounding the  airport, and special accommodations that may need  to be arranged.  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 91 states that powered parachutes are to avoid  the flow of all other air traffic. In addition, you should  inform local pilots about some of the incidentals of  powered parachute flight (such as flying low and  slow); the more information that other category pi­ lots know about PPC flight characteristics, the more  they will understand the specific needs of the powered  parachute in flight. Sharing the same airspace with  various aircraft categories requires pilots to know and  understand the rules, and understand the flight charac­ teristics and performance limitations of the different  aircraft.  

The ideal departure area for a powered parachute is an  open grassy area clear of debris and obstacles with a  groomed, even surface. Concrete and asphalt surfaces  should be avoided, as well as lit runways, as the struc­ tural integrity of the wing and suspension lines may  be compromised during takeoffs and landings if the  wing catches on the runway surface or surrounding  lighting.  

Powered parachutes do not normally take off where  the rest of the airport traffic takes off. This is to help  both the PPC pilot and the pilots of other aircraft. A  powered parachute requires time to set up and depart;  it is not polite or safe to tie up an active runway while  this is being done. Exceptions to this would be the  edge of a very wide runway or an undeveloped area  next to the active runway where setup can take place  well away from the centerline of that active runway.  

Another reason PPC pilots typically don’t use stan­ dard runways is that you want to set up into the wind  to avoid a crosswind takeoff. While slight crosswind  takeoffs are possible, they are usually unnecessary  due to the short-field capabilities of a powered para­ chute. You should do your best to point the machine  into the wind before you lay out the wing.  

Extend consideration to land owners that may own a  flight strip in their field. You need permission to use  private property as an airstrip. Locate the area on an  aeronautical sectional chart to check for possible air­ space violations or unusual hazards that could arise  by not knowing the terrain or location. Avoid loitering  around residential structures and animal enclosures  because of the slow flight attributes of the powered  parachute and the distinct engine noise.  

While selecting a takeoff position, make certain the  approach and takeoff paths are clear of other aircraft,  or will be clear by the time the equipment is set up.  Fences, power lines, trees, buildings, and other obsta­ cles should not be in the immediate flightpath unless  you are certain you will be able to safely take off and  clear them during takeoff and climbout.  

Walk the entire length of the intended takeoff and  landing area prior to departure. Look for holes, mud­ dy spots, rocks, dips in the terrain, high grass, and  other objects that can cause the aircraft to be damaged  or the wing to snag during takeoff and landing. Physi­ cally mark areas of concern with paint, flags, or  cones;  a pothole may not look like a pothole from the air.  

There are a number of preflight actions you must  perform, mandated by 14 CFR part 91. You must be­ come familiar with all available information concern­ ing your flight, to include runway lengths at airport of  intended use, takeoff and landing distance accounting  for airport elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross  weight, wind, and temperature. For a flight not in the  vicinity of a conventional airport, this information  must include weather reports and forecasts, fuel re­ quirements, and alternatives available if the planned  flight cannot be completed.  

# Weather  

The weather is a determining factor for all flight oper­ ations. Get a full weather briefing prior to your flight,  to include the current conditions and forecasts for  your departure and destination areas, and along the  route of flight. There are many sources for obtaining a  weather briefing, such as www.nws.noaa.gov, calling  1-800-WX-BRIEF, and a variety of internet sites that  specialize in local and regional weather. Crosswind  landings are possible in a powered parachute, but  crosswind takeoffs should be avoided. It is important  to review your departure procedure at your destina­ tion to ensure you don’t get into a field you cannot  depart from. In gathering your weather information,  know the wind conditions, temperature and dew point  spread, sky condition, and visibility. Review Chapters  10 and 11 in the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge  for a comprehensive understanding of  weather theory, reports, forecasts, and charts.  

PPCs fly best in calm air. Check the wind forecast as  well as current conditions, as this information will de­ termine whether safe flight can be conducted. Winds  less than 10 miles per hour (MPH) are ideal; follow  the recommendations provided by the PPC manufac­ turer for the aircraft you will be flying. Steady winds  that are not gusting are more desirable, as the inflation  and overall performance of the wing is more predict­ able. For example, 5 MPH with no gusting is better  than 1 MPH gusting to 5 MPH. Some types of wings  perform differently in certain types of wind condi­ tions and pilotage skills­—know your wing and your  abilities. Crosswind takeoffs in a powered parachute  are dangerous and should be avoided. If the runway  configuration does not allow for takeoff into the wind,  then the flight should be canceled or postponed from  that takeoff area. Do not attempt to take off in a cross­ wind with a powered parachute unless it is within the  pilot and aircraft capabilities, not a limitation in the  aircraft POH, and you have been trained thoroughly  for this advanced procedure. Crosswind landings are  possible in a powered parachute, but crosswind take­ offs should be avoided. It is important to review your  departure procedure at your destination to ensure you  don’t get into a field you cannot depart from.  

Air temperature and humidity directly affect the per­ formance of the powered parachute wing and engine.  The powered parachute pilot who doesn’t understand  and respect the effect(s) density altitude has on any  given flight may get into situations that are not de­ sirable and could be hazardous. The higher the tem­ perature, humidity, and the actual altitude of the field  you are operating from, the greater the role density  altitude plays in determining how much runway the  powered parachute needs to get off the ground with  the load on board, and how much climb performance  the wing will have once airborne. The powered para­ chute may have cleared that obstacle at   $8~\mathrm{a.m}$  . when  the weather conditions were cooler with less humid­ ity, but at   $1\ \mathrm{p.m}$  . with increased air temperature and  higher humidity levels the pilot will have to re-evalu­ ate the performance of that same aircraft. You need a  full understanding of density altitude to be a safe PPC  pilot; refer to Chapter 9 in the  Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge .  

Understand the different cloud formations and the  ground/air effects they can produce. [Figure 5-2] Cloud  clearance and visibility should be maintained for the  operations you intend to conduct (see Chapter 8 for  cloud clearance requirements in each class of airspace).  Knowledge of thermals and turbulence, and how to  determine where they can occur is also important.  [Figure 5-3]  

Do not fly when ground and flight visibility is below  minimums for your pilot certificate and the class of  airspace where you will be operating (see Chapter 8).  Be particularly watchful for low visibilities when the  air and dewpoint temperatures are within a spread of  three or four degrees. The closer these temperatures  are to each other, the greater the chance for fog and  reduced visibility conditions.  

In addition to adhering to the regulations and manu­ facturer recommendations for weather conditions, it’s  important for you to develop your own set of personal  minimums. These minimums will evolve as you gain  experience, and are also dependent on your recency  and currency in the make/model of aircraft you will  be flying.  

# Weight and Loading  

Weight and loading must be considered before each  flight. Do not exceed the maximum gross weight as  specified in the POH. Always follow the POH perfor­ mance limitations.  

The balance of the pilot, passenger, fuel and baggage  must be compared to the limitations, and the wing at­ tachment to the fuselage position must be within the  limits as specified in the POH. The cart must be bal­ anced properly or an unsafe cart configuration, either  nose-high or nose-low will result.

# The Preflight Checklist  

Use a written checklist during preflight and ground  operations. The checklist is an aid to the memory and  helps to ensure that critical items necessary for the  safe operation of the aircraft are not overlooked or  forgotten.  

# Certificates and Documents  

The airworthiness of the powered parachute is de­ termined, in part, by the following certificates and  documents, which must be on board the aircraft when  operated:  

• 	 A irworthiness certificate. • 	 R egistration certificate. • 	 O perating limitations, which may be in the  form of an FAA-approved Aircraft Flight  Manual and/or Pilot’s Operating Handbook  (AFM/POH), placards, instrument markings, or  any combination thereof. • 	 W eight and balance  

AROW is the acronym commonly used to remember  these items. The pilot in command is ultimately re­ sponsible to make sure the proper documentation is  on board. [Figure 5-4]  

Aircraft logbooks are not required to be on board the  powered parachute when it is operated. However, you  should inspect the aircraft logbooks prior to flight to  confirm the PPC has had all required tests and inspec­ tions. The owner/operator must keep maintenance re­ cords for the airframe and powerplant.  

At a minimum, there must be an annual inspection  within the preceding 12-calendar months. In addition,  the powered parachute may also need a 100-hour in­ spection in accordance with 14 CFR part 91 if it is  used for hire (for example, for training operations). If  a transponder or a transponder/encoder with a pitot-

Figure 5-4. Required documentation must be carried on  the aircraft at all times.  

static system is used, it must be inspected within each  preceding 24-calendar months.  

The pilot must have in his or her possession a valid  U.S. driver’s license, or a valid medical certificate  accompanied by a photo identification and pilot cer­ tificate. Sport pilots must also carry a copy of the en­ dorsements issued from their logbook indicating they  are qualified for the powered parachute category/class  for the aircraft they are flying. The wing shape (rec- tangular or elliptical) and the landing system (land or  sea) will be specified in this endorsement.  

# Visual Inspection  

The accomplishment of a safe flight begins with a  careful visual inspection, regardless of the category/ class of aircraft you will be flying. The purpose of the  routine preflight inspection is twofold: to determine  the powered parachute is legally airworthy, and that it  is in condition for safe flight. You determine whether  the PPC is in a condition for safe flight by a thorough  and systematic preflight inspection of the aircraft  and its components. The preflight inspection should  be performed in accordance with a printed checklist  provided by the powered parachute manufacturer for  the specific make and model of aircraft. However, the  following general areas are applicable to all powered  parachutes.  

The preflight inspection should begin as soon as  you approach the aircraft. Since the powered para­ chute can be transported by trailer, the unloading of  the aircraft allows you extra opportunity to look the  cart over from front to back and top to bottom. First  and foremost, you need to look for any damage that  may have occurred during transit. Make note of the  general appearance of the aircraft, looking for obvi­ ous discrepancies such as tires with low air pressure,  structural distortion, wear points, cart damage, and  dripping fuel or oil leaks. All tie-downs, control locks,  and chocks should be removed during the unloading  process.  

It is absolutely necessary you are thoroughly familiar  with the locations and functions of the aircraft sys­ tems, switches, and controls. Use the preflight inspec­ tion as an orientation when operating a make/model  for the first time.  

The actual “walk around” is a routine preflight inspec­ tion and has been used for years from the smallest  general aviation airplane to the largest commercial  jet. The walk around is thorough and systematic, and  should be done the same way each and every time an  aircraft will be flown. In addition to “seeing” what  you’re looking at, it requires you take the appropri­ ate action whenever a discrepancy is discovered. A  powered parachute walk around will cover five main  tasks:  

1.	Cart inspection

 	 2.	Powerplant inspection

 	 3.	Equipment check

 	 4.	Engine warm-up and check

 	 5.	Wing and suspension line inspection  

Each PPC should have a specific routine preflight in­ spection checklist, but the following can be used as a  guideline for most PPCs.  

# Cart Inspection  

Check the front nosewheel for proper play, tire infla­ tion, and secure axle bolt. Test the ground steering bar  connection points and ensure there is smooth steering  range of motion from the steering bar. Check and se­ cure the connections between the front fork and the  front axle and the front fork and the gooseneck. [Fig­ ure 5-5]  

![](images/cb280a639764bf57ac15b7cb27563c29fe27064290595ab5cf7273d7143bf306.jpg)  

# Figure 5-5. Check for proper tire inflation and that the axle  bolt is secure.  

When brakes are installed, it is common for them to  be on the front nosewheel. Typically, they are drum  or disk style operated by a cable; it is important to  inspect the cable lock, assuring it is tight. The brakes  may be hydraulic disk brakes that also incorporate a  cable; in this case, inspect both components. Check  brakes and brake systems for rust and corrosion, loose  nuts/bolts, alignment, brake pad wear/cracks, signs of  hydraulic fluid leakage, and hydraulic line security/ abrasion.  

Inside the cart where the pilot sits, check the seats,  seat rails, and seat belt attachment points for wear,  cracks, and serviceability. A few manufacturers offer  powered parachutes with adjustable front seats. The  lever moves the pin in and out of the seat rail holes  and the seat then moves forward and back along the  rail. The seat rail holes should be checked for wear;  they should be round and not oval so there is no play  

![](images/a19423d19e1a95dd7d6967e24ae12338cc37a38d4be2d35d1b7a5c755e6bdfd5.jpg)

in the fixed position of the pilot seat. Inspect where  the seat lock pins fit; check the pin and seat rail grips  for wear and serviceability. [Figure 5-6]  

The battery and ignition switches need to be in the  OFF position at the beginning of the preflight in­ spection. They will be turned on and then off again  to check the different components operated by the  power source during the preflight. While checking the  ignition switches, check that the strobe is operational  if one is installed. Exercise the primer or primer bulb,  if the PPC is so equipped; you should feel resistance  when exercised. Faulty primers can interfere with  proper engine operation.  

Manipulate the engine throttle control by slowly  moving through its full range of motion to check for  binding or stiffness. On two-stroke engines with oil  injection, it is important to check that the oil injection  mechanism is moving freely. [Figure 5-7]  

Set the altimeter to the field elevation or set in the  barometric pressure, if equipped. Turn on the ignition  or engine instrument system master and make note  of the fuel quantity gauge indications, if applicable,  for comparison with an actual visual inspection of the  fuel tank(s) during the exterior inspection.  

Inspect for any signs of deterioration, distortion, and  loose or missing bolts or locknuts.  Gently  shake the  cart to determine if objects and airframe parts are  loose and need to be tightened. Treat all aircraft and  their components with respect and care while con­ ducting a preflight. As with all aircraft, the PPC does  not need to be “over-handled” to perform an adequate  preflight inspection. Check that all cables are free of  kinks, frays, abrasions or broken strands; check each  end of each flying cable for bolt security and check  that the thimbles are not twisted or elongated.

Figure 5-7. Check the ignition switches, primer and oil  injections mechanism during preflight inspections.  

Check the steering bars for freedom of movement,  for proper steering line attachments, and confirm the  steering bars are securely attached.  

Inspect the rear wheel and axle assembly. Check the  tires for proper inflation, as well as cuts, bruises, wear,  bulges, imbedded foreign objects, and deterioration.  As a general rule, tires with cord showing, and those  with cracked sidewalls are unairworthy. Check the  axle and axle hardware, and inspect that the wheels  rotate properly.  

# Fuel and Oil  

Pay particular attention to the fuel quantity, type,  grade, and quality. Many fuel tanks are sensitive to at­ titude when attempting to fuel for maximum capacity.  The powered parachute attitude can also be affected  laterally by a ramp that slopes. Always confirm the  fuel quantity indicated on the fuel gauge(s) by visu­ ally inspecting the level of the fuel tank(s).  

The engine manufacturer recommends the type of fuel  that any given powered parachute engine should burn;  this recommendation should be strictly conformed to.  Although most PPC engine manufacturers recom­ mend premium grade auto fuel, it is usually accept­ able to burn 100LL AVGAS on a limited basis. Most  airports will not have auto fuel available on the field.  

Ensure the fuel caps have been securely replaced  following each fueling and the vents are free and  open. Most powered parachutes have an inline fuel  filter located somewhere between the tank and the  carburetors; check the fuel filter for contaminates.  [Figure 5-8]  

The fuel tank vent is an important part of all preflight  inspections. [Figure 5-9] Be alert for any signs of vent  

![](images/a2c7ae6d3b56898d6cf4778345c21f25cb3b9ef3e8a450b960a6ce09ff51aa79.jpg)

tubing damage, as well as vent blockage. A functional  check of the fuel vent system can be done simply by  opening the fuel cap. If there is a rush of air when  the fuel tank cap is opened, there could be a serious  problem with the vent system.  

![](images/374e234669cd50e11f1bc629a4491f6cb62e1439f4ff5323003d2cb28c70c84d.jpg)  
Figure 5-9. Inspect that the fuel tank vents are free of dirt  and debris to prevent fuel starvation during flight.  

Check the oil reservoir to ensure the proper oil is  used. Check the oil level during each preflight and  after each refueling. [Figure 5-10] If the consumption  of oil steadily increases or suddenly changes, quali­ fied maintenance personnel should investigate. After  checking or adding oil to the PPC, ensure that the oil  cap has been securely replaced. The oil reservoir on a  two-stroke must be checked for adequate venting; if  this becomes plugged, it could cause starvation of the  oil to the engine.  

Two cycle engines without oil injection premix the  oil with the fuel. Assure the mixture ratio is correct.  Proper mixing techniques is covered in the fuel sec­ tion.  

# Powerplant Inspection  

Inspect the propeller for any signs of propeller blade  chafing, and defects such as cracking. Check the pro­ peller for large nicks in the leading edge, cracks, pit­ ting, corrosion, and security. All propeller tape should  be securely attached to the propeller surface, paying  special attention to the convex side of the propeller  for any delaminating; propeller tape is used primarily  for protection on the leading edge of the propeller as  well as a supplemental balancing device. Check the  propeller hub for security, bolt threads showing and  general condition.  

![](images/454b024c7cc479d6c4951130e758cb54e4c1ae1f6c61939e8bbde16f16d66db3.jpg)  
Figure 5-10. It is important to check the oil reservoir cap to  make sure the vent holes are open and free of debris.  

Powered parachute engines are set up in a pusher con­ figuration, so it is essential to check the engine area  for loose items to ensure nothing is blown through the  propeller, possibly injuring the aircraft, observers, or  property. Carburetor(s) must be checked to make sure  they are secure; check the air filter for condition and  secure fit. Check the rubber manifolds for cracks and  check spark plugs to make sure all of the spark plug  caps are secure. On some two-stroke engines, there  is a reservoir that contains the lubricant for the ro­ tary valve; check this level on every preflight. Check  gear reduction boxes for leaking seals and make sure  there is not play within the gears. Look for signs of  fuel dye which may indicate a fuel leak and deteriora­ tion of fuel lines. Check for oil leaks, deterioration of  oil lines, and make certain that the oil cap, filter, oil  cooler and drain plug are secure.  

Check the exhaust system for white stains caused  by exhaust leaks at the cylinder head or cracks in  the stacks. Check exhaust components for freedom  of movement; they must be secure with all exhaust  springs in place.  

On liquid cooled engines, the radiator fluid level, as  well as the overflow reservoir, must be checked and  filled as necessary.  

Check all visible wires and lines for security and con­ dition.  

# Engine Starting  

Prior to starting the engine it is imperative to precisely  follow the engine manufacturer’s recommendation for  engine warm-up. Follow the before engine starting  and engine starting checklist procedures in the POH.  Certain precautions apply to all powered parachutes.  

Do not start the engine with the back of the cart of  the powered parachute pointed toward an open hangar  door, parked automobiles, or a group of bystanders.  This is not only discourteous, but may result in per­ sonal injury and damage to the property of others as  propeller blast is surprisingly powerful.  

When ready to start the engine, look in all directions  to be sure nothing is or will be in the vicinity of the  propeller. This includes nearby persons and aircraft  that could be struck by the propeller blast or the debris  it might pick up from the ground. Turn on the anti­ collision strobe prior to engine start (if so equipped),  even during daylight operations.  

First look around, and then shout “CLEAR PROP.”  Wait for a response from persons who may be nearby  before activating the starter.  

When activating the starter, keep one hand on the  throttle. The other hand should be on the ignition in  case the engine races immediately after start and the  throttle has no effect. This allows prompt response  if the engine falters during starting, and allows you  to rapidly retard the throttle if revolutions per minute  (RPM) are excessive after starting. A low RPM set­ ting is recommended immediately following engine  start. Do not allow the RPM to race immediately after  start, as there will be insufficient lubrication until the  oil pressure rises. In freezing temperatures, the engine  will also be exposed to potential mechanical distress  until it warms and normal internal operating clear­ ances are assumed.  

As soon as the engine is operating smoothly, check  the oil pressure, if applicable. If it does not rise to the  manufacturer’s specified value, the engine may not be  receiving proper lubrication and should be shut down  immediately to prevent serious damage. Although  quite rare, the starter motor may remain on and en­ gaged after the engine starts. This can be detected by  a continuous very high current draw on the ammeter.  Some powered parachutes also have a starter engaged  warning light specifically for this purpose. The engine  should be shut down immediately should this occur.  

Starters are small electric motors designed to draw  large amounts of current for short periods of crank­ ing. Should the engine fail to start readily, avoid con­ tinuous starter operation for periods longer than 30  seconds without a cool down period of at least 30 sec­ onds to a minute (some POHs specify even longer).  Their service life is drastically shortened from high  heat through overuse.  

If the engine fails to start at all, it may be necessary  to charge the battery or use the back-up pull starter.  Hand propping is not a procedure typically used on  powered parachutes. Always follow the manufactur­ ers’ recommendations while troubleshooting and fol­ low those specific procedures.  

# Engine Warm-Up  

Engine warm-up, or run-up, not only brings the engine  up to proper operating temperatures but also allows  you to determine that the engine and its components  are operating properly.  

Generally, the engine start-up will follow these  steps:  

•	 Walk-around is complete. •	 Safety check to include: front wheels properly  braced, engine and propeller area clear of loose  and foreign objects, area behind the cart is  clear of debris, wing lines are away from the  propeller. •	 Prime the fuel system (as equipped). •	 Activate strobe light if switch is independent of  magneto switch. •	 Shout “CLEAR PROP” and wait for “CLEAR”  response from bystanders. •	 Turn magnetos on. •	 Engine gauge switch on. •	 Check throttle – at idle. •	 Start engine.  

The warm-up procedure should never be skipped, as  the result can be costly in engine repairs and detri­ mental to the physical well-being of the pilot and pas­ senger. Pilots should know their engine temperature  parameters from the markings on the panel and the  POH limitations. Once the engine has been brought  up to normal operating temperatures, check that the  engine will produce sufficient RPM. Once again, re­ fer to the engine manufacturer’s manuals for recom­ mended procedures and parameters.  

Continually monitor all the engine’s temperature  gauges and know the engine operational minimum,  normal, and maximum temperature ranges. The en­ gine manual will also specify “difference” tempera­ tures between cylinders. Excessive split differences  between cylinders should not be overlooked, even if  both temperature readings are within the acceptable  ranges for the engine. Do not fly the powered parachute  if the temperature readings are not normal! Figure out  what the problem is before it results in a dangerous  situation or costly engine repair. Finally, test the igni­ tion switches if the engine has dual ignition systems  installed. By turning one switch off and checking the  RPM and then alternating the check with the other  switch, you can assure that both ignition switches are  operational. An engine with a dual ignition system is  intended to be run with both systems operating.  

# Taxiing  

You taxi the aircraft to get the cart from one place to  another. The wing bag is typically hung from the cart  or placed on the rear seat unless there are extra bars  installed specifically to accommodate the wing bag  while taxiing; check with your manufacturer for the  recommended procedure. [Figure 5-11] You can taxi  with the wing packed or with the wing inflated above  you; it is called “kiting” if it is inflated. During all  ground operations it is important to keep your hand on  the throttle and your feet on the steering bars. Do not  dangle your feet off of the steering bars as this could  result in a broken ankle, foot, or leg. Do not use your  feet to stop the PPC, even from low speeds. Wind is  not a factor when taxiing with the wing in the bag;  follow the procedures for initial takeoff if taxiing with  the wing inflated, or “kiting,” in any wind.  

Be aware of other aircraft that are taking off, landing  or taxiing and provide consideration for the right-of- way of others. Keep a lookout in front of you and  on both sides. Be aware of the entire area around the  powered parachute to ensure the PPC will clear all  obstructions and other aircraft. If at any time there is  doubt about the clearance from an object, you should  stop the powered parachute and verify clearance.  

![](images/679f2908d6c72d9f3fd5dcf1c0f0085424c69cc9ee8b8701016de6b170c95c98.jpg)  
Figure 5-11. Follow manufacturer recommendations for  bag placement when taxiing.  

Even though you may not be using a standard runway,  you may need to cross active runways or taxiways  to get to the area designated for powered parachute  operations. That means understanding radio commu­ nications and keeping your eyes and ears open. You  probably have better visibility than a pilot in a typical  airplane.  

The primary requirements for safe taxiing are positive  control of the aircraft at all times, the ability to recog­ nize potential hazards in time to avoid them, and the  ability to stop or turn where and when desired. While  on the ground, the throttle directly controls your  groundspeed. It is important not to taxi too fast, and  be careful no one is in your prop blast. Going too fast  can damage the frame or the suspension. The grass  you taxi on could have holes and ditches, and damage  the suspension. When taxiway centerline stripes are  provided, they should be observed unless necessary  to clear airplanes or obstructions.  

Ground steering is accomplished by controlling the  ground steering bar. The ground steering bar may in  fact be a bar, handle, wheel, or lever; ground steer­ ing controls are as varied as the powered parachutes  themselves. Operate the ground steering in a slow  and deliberate manner, never jerky or erratic. Some  ground steering bars are pushed forward to turn right  and pulled back to turn left. Others are just the op­ posite. Consult the POH for each make and model  of aircraft you fly to determine the safe and proper  operation of the ground steering.  

When taxiing, it is best to slow down before attempt­ ing a turn. Sharp, high-speed turns place undesirable  side loads on the landing gear and may result in an  uncontrollable swerve. If the wing is inflated, the cart  will not follow the direction of the wing due to the  friction (via the wheels) with the ground. If the cart  and the wing are not going in the same direction, you  must prevent the wing from gaining enough lift (via  cart groundspeed) to pull the cart over on its side.  (See Chapter 12 for more details on pull-overs.) Ad­ just power or apply braking as necessary to control  the taxi speed. More engine power may be required  to start the powered parachute moving forward, or to  start a turn, than is required to keep it moving in any  given direction. When using additional power, retard  the throttle immediately once the powered parachute  begins moving, to prevent excessive acceleration.  

When first beginning to taxi the PPC cart, if equipped  with brakes, test them for proper operation as soon as  the powered parachute is put in motion (typically with  a hand control). Apply power to start the powered  parachute moving forward slowly, and then retard the  throttle and simultaneously apply pressure smoothly  to the brakes.  

To avoid overheating the brakes when taxiing, keep  engine power to a minimum. Rather than continu­ ously riding the brakes to control speed, it is better to  apply brakes only occasionally. Other than sharp turns  at low speed, the throttle should be at idle before the  brakes are applied. It is a common error to taxi with a  power setting that requires controlling taxi speed with  the brakes. This is the aeronautical equivalent of driv­ ing an automobile with both the accelerator and brake  pedals depressed at the same time.  

When taxiing with an inflated wing (kiting), the ram- air wing will try to weathervane. The wing is designed  to be self-centering; its strongest desire is to point into  the wind.  

Stop the powered parachute with the nosewheel  straight ahead to relieve any side load on the nose­ wheel and to make it easier to start moving ahead.  

At nontowered airports, you should announce your  intentions on the common traffic advisory frequency  (CTAF) assigned to that airport. When operating from  an airport with an operating control tower, you must  contact the appropriate controller for a clearance to  taxi, and a takeoff clearance before taxiing onto the  active runway.  

After landing, taxiing with the parachute inflated re­ quires you to coordinate movements between the roll­ ing cart on the ground and the flying wing in the air.  Cross-controlling by steering the cart one way while  failing to steer the wing in the same direction creates  a dangerous situation that may end in a rollover. Com­ mon errors in taxiing with the wing inflated are:  

• 	Failing to maintain enough forward speed to  keep the wing inflated and flying overhead. • 	Maintaining too much speed over the ground  and thereby lifting the nosewheel off the  ground; preventing the nosewheel from being  able to control the direction of the cart. • 	Not steering the wing along with the cart. • 	Attempting to turn the cart too tight for the  wing to be able to keep up. • 	Failing to take wind into account. • 	Attempting to taxi when winds are too high, 	 change in direction, or are gusty.  

# Wing Inspection  

The powered parachute flight instructor will spend a  great deal of time explaining the systems of the wing,  the proper preflight, and the different methods of stag­ ing the wing for inflation by means of different layout  techniques. The wing, and its performance, is critical  to flight and safety; once again a thorough and sys­ tematic preflight procedure is essential.  

Check the wind direction and manually point the cart  directly into the wind. Many PPC pilots use a tele­ scoping rod with a windsock or long strip of narrow  rip-stop suspended from the top, displayed from their  powered parachute trailer or vehicle to determine wind  direction and wind speed. Some pilots prefer hand­ held wind speed/direction devices. Most conventional  airports have some sort of wind indicator (windsock,  wind T, etc.) positioned in the segmented circle, as  well as electronic weather indicators that accurately  measure wind speed and direction at the field. Once  the powered parachute engine starts it will be nearly  impossible for the pilot to determine the direction of  the wind without the aid of a wind direction indicator.  [Figure 5-12]  

Remove the wing bag from its stored position on the  airframe, either on the rear or pilot’s seat, or hanging  from the airframe itself. It is critical that the bag not  be twisted, rotated or turned when removing it from  its storage location, as doing so will twist and entan­ gle the suspension lines. Another determining factor  in keeping the suspension lines free from   is how you  packed the wing away the last time it was flown; the  proper procedure for re-bagging the PPC wing will be  covered at the end of this chapter.  

It is critical for the powered parachute pilot to be able  to recognize when the suspension lines are twisted  and to know how to untwist them. Most wing bags  are clearly marked with an emblem or other marking  to identify one side of the bag from the other. Keep­ ing the marked side of the wing bag always facing  in the same direction (either facing the cart or facing  away from the cart) is a helpful reference to deter­ mine if you have twisted the suspension lines while  moving the wing into place, either on or behind the  cart. The key is to be consistent and methodical in  whatever procedure you use. Your flight instructor  will offer input on a practical procedure. The height  and physical strength of the pilot will also be a factor  in determining the best position on the cart to store  the wing bag.  

Place the wing bag on the ground directly behind the  airframe as far back as the riser and support lines will  allow, keeping the wing bag in the same configuration  that it was removed from the cart. You will have to pull  both line sleeves that hold the suspension lines out of  

![](images/a792f6eebe7e24e86f0bd9e1b3946111e7074f807d6c74f049b3fae4b6e56f4f.jpg)

the wing bag, and one line sleeve up and around the  cart to follow the bag; those lines should run straight  from the attach points on the cart to the wing bag after  the bag is in position behind the cart. Tilt the wing bag  toward the cart to spill the folded wing out of the bag  and onto the ground. [Figure 5-13]  

With the wing folded behind the cart, you are ready  to spread it out and in doing so begin to visually in­ spect the uninflated wing. Unfold the right side of the  wing toward the right and repeat on the left side. As  you unfold the wing, it should remain centered di­ rectly behind the cart. After the wing is completely  unfolded, stand directly behind the cart and hold the  leading edge of the wing up in front of you as you  face the backside of the cart. You will see an “x” in the  lines; this “x” should be positioned directly behind  the centerline of the prop on the cart. [Figure 5-14] If  it is not, physically pick up the center and drag it into  the center position. Then go to the end of the side that  will be bunched up and pull out the slack.  

Remove the protective sleeves that cover the sus­ pension lines and their components. The protective  sleeves are referred to as line sleeves and there is a  line sleeve on each set of lines (or two­— the right and  the left). [Figure 5-15]  

While laying out the wing, check for tears in the fab­ ric, torn or loose stitching, abrasions, and deteriora­ tion of the fabric from ultraviolet rays. The sun is one  of the powered parachute wing’s worst enemies, next  to the prop! Certain colors deteriorate faster than oth­ ers, like red and orange, when exposed to ultraviolet  rays from the sun. When the wing is not being used,  you should always return it to its wing bag. Take this  opportunity to check the wing cells for debris, such as  stones, sticks, and bugs; lifting the wing by the trail­ ing edge and gently shaking it will allow most cap­ tured debris to fall out of the ram-air openings on the  leading edge of the wing.  

With the wing centered behind the cart, it is time to  start checking the suspension lines. At first glance  it may look difficult to sort out all of the lines from  the cart to the wing. Most of the time, the lines will  straighten out with just a light flick of the wrist. Make  sure you have no twists or line-overs and your lines  are straight. As long as the wing has not been physi­ cally removed, or disconnected from the cart, there  should not be any permanent knots in the lines. In  the event that you detect pressure knots during the  line inspection they are easily removed with minimal  manipulation.

Figure 5-15. Removal of the line sleeve is an important  step in the wing layout and inspection.  

Small twigs, stems from weeds, and other debris can  get caught in the lines to form pressure knots. Pres­ sure knots are a concern because they are only “knots”  when there is tension on the lines. That means they are  only a problem when your wing is inflated.  As soon  as you land, the foreign object often shakes free and  there is no knot. However, while you are flying, that  pressure knot can cause the powered parachute to go  into a steep turn. Make sure there is nothing around to  catch into your line sets. The more organized the sus­ pension lines are laid out during this preflight check,  the more likely that the wing will kite evenly and  without mishap. It may take a great deal of space to  get all the cells open during the inflation of the wing.  Aborting the takeoff to re-kite the wing is always an  option, but it is not desirable. Preflight the wing cor­ rectly the first time.  

If you put your wing away correctly and took it out  as described, it should not have any twists in it. How­ ever, you still need to check. Start where the risers at­ tach to the cart. Make sure they are not twisted around  anything and trace each one back to the point where  the wing risers are attached to the cart.  

Check the steering lines on both sides of the cart;  make sure the anchor point knots are secure and the  lines flow freely through all guides and pulleys. Make  sure the links on both sides of the aircraft are secure;  it is recommended that the links are finger tight plus  one-quarter turn. Continue by checking that the riser  cables are not twisted or damaged and they are free  from tangles. At this time pull slack from the steering  lines so the steering bars are fully retracted. Physi­ cally separating the steering lines from the suspension  lines, pulling them out and away to the outer edge of  the wingtips, enables you to visually see the steering  lines are free from being tangled with the rest of the  lines. [Figure 5-16]  

Continue to check the suspension lines for tangles,  knots and wear and the attachment points for security  and lack of fraying. [Figure 5-17] The A lines should  be visually and physically separated from the B lines  at the point where the lines are connected to the ris­ ers. Most newer wing lines are color-coded to make  this process visually easier; the older wing styles will  still be separated and configured the same way as the  newer wings, however all the lines will be the same  color. The A lines will travel toward the leading edge  of the wing and subdivide into the C lines. The B lines  will travel toward the trailing edge of the wing and  subdivide into the D lines. Make sure that the lines  are all separated and not tangled. The A/C lines will  be on top of the B/D lines when the lines are returned  to the ground after the preflight of each section. Make  sure there is no debris around to catch in the line sets  during wing inflation; when the length of the line is  altered it changes how the line holds the wing. The  length of the lines are clearly defined by the manufac­ turers and should not be changed. The more organized

the suspension lines are laid out during this preflight  check, the more likely that the wing will kite evenly  and without mishap; a lot of runway can be used up  trying to get all the cells open during inflation of the  wing. Aborting the takeoff to re-kite the wing is al­ ways an option, but it is not desirable. Preflight the  wing correctly the first time; taking your time will pay  off in the end.  

# Line Tangles, Twists, and Line-Overs  

Line tangles and twists can be frustrating if you do  not understand how to solve them. The good news  is that wing line problems are simple to understand,  few in type, and easy to solve. They break down into  line twists and line-overs. A definite advantage for the  pilot is that both ends of the suspension lines are at­ tached to either the risers or the wing. That means  there are no loose ends to get twisted in and around  each other. Any loops in the lines readily pull out if  shaken a little; gently shaking all of the lines loose is  an important step to get the wing laid out properly in  preparation for flight.  

# Line Twists  

A line twist is when all of the lines on both sides of  the wing are spiraled together. Sometimes it will seem  that all of the lines on one side are twisted around  the steering line. That is actually the case. [Figure  5-18] Trying to fly the powered parachute with the  suspension lines twisted is unsafe and the pilot should  consider the wing unairworthy until the line twist is  removed. Line twists most often occur because the  pilot inadvertently flips, or turns, the wing over while  moving it from the stowed position. This is why it is  so important to put your wing away and take it out the  same way each time. The suspension lines can also  get twisted if the wing flies over the cart accidentally,  or if the wing is incorrectly repositioned behind the  cart when the wing settles to one side of the cart dur­ ing an aborted takeoff or during landing.  

![](images/514a192b910e6193bc4c106618c54942cc8cd811e78ad1731866a5da952b72f5.jpg)  

# Figure 5-18. Line twist.  

Unless someone has mistakenly twisted a single set  of suspension lines while rigging the PPC wing to the  cart at the attachment points, a line twist will happen  to both sets of lines on both sides of the powered para­ chute at the same time. This stands to reason if you  think of the entire configuration of cart and attached  wing as a continuous structure or a complete circle.  

To get rid of a line twist, you do not have to pack the  wing back into the wing bag and flip the whole bag in  reverse, although this is an option. You can actually  flip the wing while it is out of the bag.  

With the wing laid out behind the cart, determine if  the twist is clockwise or counterclockwise in configu­ ration. If the twist in the line is traveling clockwise as  you face the chute, the wing edge you are working with  will have to travel counterclockwise back through the  center of the two sets of lines (or through the center of  the circle created by the cart/wing configuration) and  under the twisted group of lines you are holding. A  counterclockwise twist will require just the opposite  movement. The wing edge will need to travel clock­ wise under the line set and then up and over the twist  via the center of the circle. Remember to maintain the  clockwise motion for the counterclockwise twist, and  the counterclockwise motion for the clockwise twist.  

Disconnecting the wing from the risers or the wing  from the cart is not a safe practice; the flight instructor  needs to explain this to the PPC student in detail. The  risers are specific to each cart. Refer to the PPC manu­ facturer and the operating manual for information.  

Starting at the riser cables, gather all the lines in the  group and walk toward the wing keeping the lines  gathered as you go. Once close to the wing, you can  easily manipulate the edge of the wing and not tangle  the lines any further. The key is to remember that the  lines are twisted as a group—not tangled individu­ ally—therefore they must be untwisted as a group to  prevent them from becoming tangled. [Figures 5-19  and 5-20]  

![](images/6e88545178a94d4a681a582a652673198913e0b532c03cb4fc299d945c48487d.jpg)

Figure 5-20. Pilot throwing the wing edge through to undo  a line twist.  

Lay out the half of the wing you just worked on. If that  side looks good, it means you can do the same thing  to the other side of the chute. The same sequence of  checking for twist direction, gathering the lines and  then twisting the wing edge in the opposite direction  of the twisted lines is completed on the second set of  lines. It stands to reason that the twist will be in the  opposite direction than the twist on the other set of  lines you just cleared.  

There is a possibility that the side you are working  on still doesn’t look right when you re-check it. If the  lines still look twisted, then you probably flipped the  wing the wrong way. The good news is that there are  only the two types of line twists, clockwise and coun­ terclockwise—with a little practice you will be able  to recognize the twist well before you start handling  the wing.  

# Line-Overs  

The line-over is one of the most dangerous things that  can happen to the powered parachute wing. A line- over is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of the wing  line going straight from the wing to the riser system, it  takes a trip over the top of the wing first. This means  that when the wing inflates, the suspension line that is  over the top of the wing will pinch the wing together  and prevent the proper inflation of the wing to pro­ duce the airfoil necessary to achieve flight. If a line is  over the top surface of the wing, the pilot risks serious  injury or death if takeoff is attempted. To recognize  a line-over before you take off, look for a line that is  twisted with other lines on one or both sides of the  wing. If you see that, your next step should be to in­ spect the leading edge and top of the wing closely. If  you see a line wrapped over the top, you have found  your problem.  

Sometimes using the “stacked” method of laying out  the wing during the final wing staging before flight  versus the “inverted” method can inadvertently pro­ duce a line-over on the top side of the wing as it in­ flates. Also, “stuffing” the wing into the wing bag  versus methodically folding the wing for storage can  cause a line to become wrapped around the top of the  wing mistakenly. [Figure 5-21]  

To correct a line-over, pull the fabric of the wing  through the loop made by the line-over. To know  which side to pull the noncompliant suspension line  to, trace the line to its home line group (left or right  riser) before you start pulling things around. Some­ times the side will be easy to determine because the  line-over is either close to the left or right edge of the  

![](images/715ddb73aa638a4f53f6e5a252185c84f246ec477457326f90310003def2c9d9.jpg)

wing. When it is not, tracing it is the best way to save  time and to determine the correct way to pull the wing  fabric.  

# Preparing for Takeoff  

Wing inflation and kiting procedures are critical to a  successful takeoff. Refer to Chapter 7 for informa­ tion on how to lay out the wing, wing inflation, and  kiting.  

# After Landing  

It is imperative to evaluate the field in which you in­ tend to land, particularly because of the unique nature  of the powered parachute wing, and what happens to  it prior to landing. If the field is being used by other  aircraft, taxi the powered parachute off the “active”  area or runway surface while the wing remains kited.  Ground taxiing with the wing kited takes a little prac­ tice, but the flight instructor will make sure the stu­ dent pilot has adequately mastered this skill prior to  takeoff instruction.  

After the powered parachute has touched down,  re­ lease the flare on the wing ; this is done to prevent the  aircraft from becoming airborne again. Not releasing  the flare on landing is a critical and common mistake  made by both new and seasoned PPC pilots. With the  throttle at idle, the powered parachute begins to slow  down to the point where the stream of air is not suf­ ficient to maintain the wing’s pressurization. At this  time, the engine must be shut down immediately; the  consequences of not turning off the magnetos dur­ ing the after-landing roll are detrimental to the well-
 being of the wing because the propeller will most  likely chop the PPC lines. A turning propeller and the  wing and its components do not mix. Once you turn  off the magnetos, you will physically grab the steering  lines from overhead and pull the wing to the ground  to finish the deflation process. If the wing is allowed  to “float” down on its own, a small gust of wind can  force the suspension lines onto hot exhaust surfaces  which can melt the lines, or even pick up the cart and  instigate a landing roll.  

# Clearing the Runway  

If a powered parachute lands on the center of a run­ way, it is considered good practice to taxi to the edge  of or even off of the runway before collapsing the  wing and stowing equipment. When doing that, it is  important to keep the powered parachute moving af­ ter landing to keep the wing inflated. The safest and  easiest method is to keep taxiing straight into the wind  until you clear the runway or landing area and can  collapse the parachute out of the way of other aircraft.  If you determine that winds are too strong or gusty to  taxi off of an active runway, an alternate landing area  should be chosen.  

# Parking  

Unless parking in a designated, supervised area, you  should select a location which will prevent the propel­ ler blast of other airplanes from striking the powered  parachute broadside. The powered parachute engine is  not enclosed in a cowling and engine surfaces will be  extremely hot. Never assume a bystander will know  this; even though the engine is not operating, it can  still be dangerous.  

Once out of the powered parachute, you should im­ mediately pull the trailing edge of the wing forward  toward the cart and roll the leading edge and cell  openings under the wing surface; this will prevent  gusts of air from grabbing the wing and pulling the  cart backward. After the wing is totally disabled from  becoming airborne, you can assist your passenger in  disembarking from the cart.  

# Postflight  

A flight is never complete until the engine is shut down  and the aircraft is secure. A pilot should consider this  an essential part of any flight.  

After engine shutdown and the passenger exits the  cart, the pilot should accomplish a postflight inspec­ tion. This includes checking the general condition of  the aircraft. For additional departures, the oil should  be rechecked and fuel added if required. If the PPC is  going to be inactive for a period of time, put the wing  properly back in the bag to keep it out of the sun.  

# Packing the Wing  

As discussed earlier in this chapter, packing the wing  back into the wing bag at the end of the flight is a nec­ essary task. The care and method the pilot employs  for this critical task directly affects whether or not the  wing is easy to unpack for the next flight. The process  of folding the wing and returning it safely to its wing  bag takes little time and the powered parachute pas­ senger can lend a hand to the pilot in the process. If  the pilot is flying solo the process will take a little  longer, but the overall results will be the same and  this gives the pilot an opportunity to do a thorough  postflight inspection of both the wing itself and the  suspension lines.  

After disembarking from the cart, the wing should be  repositioned in the inverted layout with the exception  that the cart/prop hoop will be positioned very close  to the trailing edge of the wing. At that time the line  sleeves should both be replaced on each set of sus­ pension lines. When the line sleeves are in place, the  two bundles and any suspension lines left showing  are placed on the exposed lower surface of the wing  where they will be neatly packaged for storage during  the folding process of the wing.  

Starting with one outer trailing edge of the wing, draw  the wing surface up and over the surface of the wing  fabric to the very center of the wing. The same action  will then be completed on the leading edge of the wing  on the same side. The process is then completed two  more times on the same side. Then the wing is folded  from the other side three times in the same manner,  resulting in a long rectangle of wing lying directly  behind the prop line of the cart. This is one example;  it is important for you to follow the manufacturer’s  recommendations for your PPC.  

The pilot then starts at the edge closest to the cart and  folds the sides of the folded wing alternately in on  each other, depressing the trapped air out of the fabric,  all the way to the farthest area away from the cart.  [Figure 5-22] Once this is complete, the wing pack­ age size is established by taking the farthest edge and  folding it toward the cart over and over until a neat  square is obtained on the last fold.  

After the wing is folded and lying on the ground be­ hind the cart, the wing bag is placed on the ground  next to the wing (on the side away from the cart).  [Figure 5-23] It is advised to have a “marked” side  of the bag and always keep the marked side facing up  or in the same direction every time you load the wing  into the bag and onto the cart. The wing is then neatly  pulled into the bag. The pilot then picks the bag up on  end and gathers the line sleeves on top of the wing.  [Figure 5-24] Refer to the manufacturer’s recommen­ dations for loading the wing in its bag on the cart for  taxi and storage.

# The Four Fundamentals  

There are four basic flight maneuvers upon which all  flying tasks are based: straight-and-level flight, turns,  climbs, and descents.  

In addition, the powered parachute (PPC) has a  unique characteristic, the pendulum effect, as covered  in Chapter 2. This chapter will cover the basic flight  maneuvers and how they are influenced by this pen­ dulum effect.  

# Flight Controls  

The PPC has two basic flight controls:  

1.	Throttle: used to adjust the vertical speed to  climb or descend

 	 2.	Steering controls: used to turn right or left  

The wing design, angle of trim, and total weight de­ termine the PPC airspeed, which remains about the  same for most flight operations.  

The vast majority of PPC steering is done via either  foot pedals or foot steering bars. However, some PPC  designs incorporate hand steering controls. In addition  to the mechanical hand or foot steering controls, the  steering line itself can be pulled directly or in combi­ nation with the mechanical controls. For simplicity  of the information in this handbook, flight steering  controls will be addressed as foot controls. For those  PPCs with hand steering controls or steering lines that  are pulled directly, substitute “push the foot steering  control” with “pull the hand steering control” or “pull  on the steering line.”  

# Throttle  

While in the air, the throttle provides thrust and there­ fore controls altitude; it is used to climb and descend.  Throttle changes will not measurably affect your air­ speed. The aircraft maintains about the same indicat­ ed airspeed throughout your pitch angle and altitude  changes. There is less than a 1 MPH increase in speed  as the throttle is increased from gliding flight to level  flight; not easily measured on the instruments or felt  by the pilot in the air.  

Pitch angle changes in a PPC are similar to pitch  changes in an airplane being flown at a constant air­ speed. Assuming a typical 3-to-1 glide ratio for a pow­ ered parachute, the pitch increases about 20 degrees  from gliding flight to level flight. The pitch would  increase an additional 20 degrees from level flight to  full power climb, assuming a three-to-one climb path  with a high powered engine. This total pitch change  of 40 degrees from glide to high powered climb is  significant and noticed by the pilot, passenger, and  observers on the ground. Throughout the large pitch  variations of the PPC, the PPC will continue to fly at  about the same airspeed, even with the engine off.  

As you descend with the throttle retarded, the nose of  the cart is pointed more towards the ground while the  wing is overhead. As you climb, the nose of the cart  is pointed more towards the sky, and the wing appears  to be rotated in back of you. These are large pitch  changes. A common misunderstanding is that these  pitch changes, which can be as much as 40 degrees,  are a change of angle of attack. This is not the case.  The angle of attack stays almost constant for the same  weight and the same speed, but the pitch angle, espe­ cially as viewed from the cart, changes dramatically.  

On a PPC, the angle of trim is determined by the  suspension lines and set at the factory, but the cart  can rotate around the riser attachment point to the  cart. Generally, the angle between the cart and the  wing remains the same; both pitch together rotating  around the center of gravity of the complete aircraft.  [Figure 6-1]  

Flying in good atmospheric conditions and using  smooth throttle applications can avoid additional  loading which results in slight increases in angle of  attack and speed.  

A common, inappropriate use of the throttle is an  abrupt power application when the engine is at idle.  This abrupt application of throttle from idle to full  

![](images/7093fe271d0049a1c4dc09d8265bd3b01fbbbbcc55c64ce4c99ba924cf28e006.jpg)  
Figure 6-1. The cart and wing pitch together.  

creates a porpoising effect. Gradually increase the  throttle to full to avoid the abrupt porpoising.  

# Clearing Turns  

Pilots should perform clearing turns prior to begin­ ning any maneuver and any turns. Proper clearing  procedures combined with proper visual scanning  techniques are the most effective strategy for colli­ sion avoidance. The essential idea of the clearing turn  is to be certain that the next maneuver is not going  to proceed into another aircraft’s flightpath. Refer to  Chapter 9.  

# Turning the Powered Parachute  

Steering lines run from the foot controls, through a  series of pulleys parallel to the risers and suspension  lines and are connected to the trailing edge of the cor­ responding side of the wing. The right steering line at  the front end is attached to the right steering control  at the cockpit (either foot or hand control), and the  other end is directly attached to the trailing edge of the  right side of the wing. Hence, when you push a foot  steering control, you pull on a steering line and “pull- down” the trailing edge of the corresponding side of  the wing, which creates drag on that side of the wing’s  trailing edge. The drag from the pulled-down trail­ ing edge slows down and drops that side’s wing, and  the opposite side of the wing simultaneously pivots  around the vertical and longitudinal axes in a coor­ dinated turn. The PPC is designed to fly straight into  the relative wind, which is a key factor in the PPC’s  ability to automatically perform a coordinated turn.  [Figure 6-2]  

While airborne, you will turn in the same direction  of the foot steering control that you push: push right  foot—go right; push left foot—go left.  

Similar to the pendulum effect with throttle, there  can also be a swinging pendulum effect during turns.  For example, if you are in a stabilized right, medium- banked turn (approximately 20 to 45 degrees bank),  the pendulum is swinging out opposing the lift com­ ponent of the wing. If an abrupt left turn is initiated,  the wing will start to turn but the momentum of the  cart cannot respond as quickly. This results in the pi­ lot not coordinating the pendulum effect, and can be  avoided with smoother and less abrupt turns so the  cart can keep up with the wing.  

# Feel of the PPC  

The ability to sense a flight condition, without relying  on cockpit instrumentation, is often called “feel of the  PPC,” but senses in addition to “feel” are involved.  

Sounds inherent to flight are an important sense in  developing “feel.” The air rushes past the PPC pilot,  who is not typically masked by enclosures. When the  level of sound increases, it indicates that speed is in­ creasing. Also, the powerplant emits distinctive sound  patterns in different conditions of flight as the RPM  is adjusted. The sound of the engine in cruise flight  may be different from that in a climb, and different  again from that in a descent and can aid the pilot in  estimating not only the present airspeed but the air­ speed trend.  

The sources of actual “feel” are important to the pilot.  The pilot’s own body responds to forces of accelera­ tion. These “G” loads imposed on the cart are also felt  by the pilot. Increased G loads force the pilot down  

![](images/9b329fadcf8116f7823deb1a401756665f8921227c2b839934d738b89fcbfd53.jpg)  
Figure 6-2. Apply steering input to one side of the trailing edge to turn.  

into the seat or raise the pilot against the seat belt.  Radial accelerations produce side loadings, which  will shift the pilot from side to side in the seat. These  forces need not be strong, only perceptible by the pilot  to be useful.  

An accomplished pilot who has excellent “feel” for  the PPC will be able to understand and coordinate the  rate of bank change so as not to overshoot the desired  course or bank, and ultimately be able to anticipate  the pendulum effect. The wing trailing edge control  surfaces move in the airstream and meet resistance  proportional to the speed and weight of the cart. When  the cart is heavy and flying faster, the steering con­ trols are stiffer and harder to move because the wing  internal pressure is higher. When the cart is light and  flying slower, there is less force required and controls  move easier.  

The senses that contribute to “feel” of the airplane  are inherent in people. However, “feel” must be de­ veloped. The flight instructor should direct the begin­ ning pilot to be attuned to these senses and teach an  awareness of their meaning as it relates to various  conditions of flight. To do this effectively, the flight  instructor must fully understand the difference be­ tween perceiving something and merely noticing it. It  is a well established fact that the pilot who develops  a “feel” for the PPC early in flight training will have  little difficulty with advanced flight maneuvers.  

# Attitude Flying  

In a PPC, flying by attitude means visually establish­ ing the aircraft’s attitude with reference to the natural  horizon. [Figure 6-3] Attitude is the angular difference  measured between an aircraft’s axis and the line of the  Earth’s horizon. Pitch attitude is the angle formed by  the longitudinal axis of the aircraft and the horizon.  Bank attitude is the angle formed by the lateral axis  with the horizon.  

In attitude flying, the PPC pilot controls two compo­ nents: pitch and bank.  

•	 Pitch control is the control of the PPC about the 	 lateral axis by using the throttle to raise and  lower the nose in relation to the natural horizon. • 	Bank control is control of the PPC about the  longitudinal axis by use of the PPC steering  controls to attain a desired bank angle in  relation to the natural horizon.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

It is impossible to emphasize too strongly the neces­ sity for forming correct habits in flying straight and  level. All other flight maneuvers are in essence a de­ viation from this fundamental flight maneuver. Per­ fection in straight-and-level flight will not come of  itself. It is not uncommon to find a pilot whose basic  flying ability consistently falls just short of minimum  expected standards, and upon analyzing the reasons  for the shortcomings to discover that the cause is the  inability to properly fly straight and level.  

![](images/6dcb1a111b23ee2d7358f79b3d8af615310b56c721f296473f87b4bf6966e8b5.jpg)  

Straight-and-level flight is flight in which a constant  heading and altitude are maintained. It is accomplished  by making immediate and measured corrections for  deviations in direction and altitude from unintentional  slight turns, descents, and climbs. Level flight, at first,  is a matter of consciously fixing the relationship of  the position of some portion of the PPC, used as a  reference point, with the horizon. In establishing the  reference points, place the PPC in the desired posi­ tion and select a reference point. No two pilots see  this relationship exactly the same. The references will  depend on where the pilot is sitting, the pilot’s height  (whether short or tall), and the pilot’s manner of sit­ ting. It is, therefore, important that during the fixing  of this relationship, you sit in a normal manner; other­ wise the points will not be the same when the normal  position is resumed.  

In learning to control the aircraft in level flight, it is  important to use only slight control movements, just  enough to produce the desired result. Pilots need to  associate the apparent movement of the references  with the forces which produce it. In this way, you can  develop the ability to regulate the change desired in  the aircraft’s attitude by the amount and direction of  forces applied to the controls.  

The pitch attitude for level flight (constant altitude) is  usually obtained by selecting some portion of the air­ craft’s nose as a reference point, and then keeping that  point in a fixed position relative to the horizon. [Figure  6-4] Using the principles of attitude flying, that posi­ tion should be cross-checked occasionally against the  altimeter (if so equipped) to determine whether or not  the pitch attitude is correct. If altitude is being gained  or lost, the pitch attitude should be readjusted in rela­ tion to the horizon and then the altimeter rechecked to  

![](images/c255725ad8c2a8db6a115a4a16048814e06c3a7c238b742e53fcce1a3eebed3d.jpg)  
Figure 6-4. Nose reference for straight-and-level flight.  

determine if altitude is now being maintained. The ap­ plication of increasing and decreasing throttle is used  to control this attitude.  

In all normal maneuvers, the term “increase the pitch  attitude” implies raising the nose in relation to the ho­ rizon (by increasing power); the term “decreasing the  pitch attitude” means lowering the nose (by decreas­ ing power). While foot controls do have an effect on  altitude, they are not typically used as a control for  flying straight and level. A PPC must be capable of  maintaining altitude to tolerances using the controls  as designed.  

Anytime the wing is banked, even very slightly, the  aircraft will turn. In a PPC the pilot has no useful  reference to measure bank angle like an airplane or  weight shift control aircraft where the wing tips are  visible in relation to the horizon. The objective of  straight-and-level flight is to detect small deviations  from laterally level flight as soon as they occur, neces­ sitating only small corrections. Reference to the mag­ netic compass or GPS, if so equipped, can be made  to note any change in direction; however, the visual  reference of a point on the horizon with a point on the  aircraft such as the front wheel or instrument panel  will typically be used for sport pilot training.  

Continually observing the nose to align the heading  should be avoided. The pilot must spend more time  scanning for air traffic than focusing on heading. This  helps divert the pilot’s attention from the aircraft’s  nose, prevents a fixed stare, and automatically ex­ pands the pilot’s area of vision by increasing the range  necessary for the pilot’s vision to cover.  

Straight-and-level flight requires almost no applica­ tion of control pressures if the aircraft is properly  trimmed to fly straight and the air is smooth. Some  PPCs will have a directional trim control which ad­ justs the tension in a control line to make it fly straight.  Each PPC manufacturer has a unique design for their  particular aircraft. The pilot must not form the habit  of constantly moving the controls unnecessarily. You  must learn to recognize when corrections are neces­ sary, and then make a measured response. Tolerances  necessary for passing the PPC practical test are   $\pm10$  degrees heading and  $\pm100$   feet altitude. Students may  initially start to make corrections when tolerances are  exceeded but should strive to initiate a correction be­ fore the tolerances are exceeded, such as starting cor­ rection before the tolerance is   $\pm5$   degreees heading  and  $\pm50$   feet altitude.  

Since the PPC does not have an elevator to control the  pitch, immediate minor adjustments should be made  while flying close to the ground. In flying a low ap­ proach (flying straight and level over the centerline of  the runway at a low but specified distance from the  ground), think of the throttle as the coarse and slow  response altitude control, and application of both  steering controls (flare) as the fine adjustments to al­ titude adjustment. Throttle has a slight delay between  implementation and response in increasing altitude;  flare relatively quickly increases altitude but can only  hold altitude changes temporarily (about 2 seconds).  This would be like applying flaps on an airplane if no  elevator control was available.  

While trying to maintain a constant altitude, especially  when close to the ground, you can fly with about one- third flare. By holding a small flare, if you encounter  downdrafts, you can immediately add a large portion  of flare to lift you back to the desired altitude. If the  PPC begins to climb, then you can reduce the amount  of the flare to return to the desired altitude, until you  can adjust your throttle position again.  

Common errors in the performance of straight-and-  level flight are:  

•	 Attempting to use improper reference points on  the aircraft to establish attitude. •	 Forgetting the location of preselected reference  points on subsequent flights. • 	Attempting to establish or correct aircraft  attitude using flight instruments rather than  outside visual reference. •	 Overcontrol and lack of feel. •	 Improper scanning and/or devoting insufficient  time to outside visual reference. •	 Fixation on the nose (pitch attitude) reference  point. •	 Unnecessary or inappropriate control inputs. •	 Failure to make timely and measured control  inputs when deviations from straight-and-level  flight are detected. •	 Inadequate attention to sensory inputs in  developing feel for the PPC.  

# Level Turns  

A turn is made by banking the wing in the direction of  the desired turn. A specific angle of bank is selected  by the pilot, control pressures applied to achieve the  desired bank angle, and appropriate control pressures  exerted to maintain the desired bank angle once it is  established.  

Both primary controls are used in close coordination  when making level turns. Their functions are as follows.  

•	 The steering bars bank the wings and so  determine the rate of turn. •	 The throttle determines vertical speed and must  be increased during a turn for the PPC to remain  level. The greater the degree of turn, the greater  the throttle/thrust required to remain level; this  is similar to an airplane and weight-shift control  aircraft.  

For purposes of this discussion, turns are divided into  three types: shallow, medium, and steep.  

•	 Shallow turns are those in which the bank is  less than approximately   $20^{\circ}$  . •	 Medium turns are those resulting from  approximately   $20^{\circ}$   to  $45^{\circ}$   of bank. •	 Steep turns are those resulting from  $45^{\circ}$   or  more of bank. Steep turns are generally not  recommended in a PPC.  

Bank angle is measured in a PPC from angle of the  horizon and any level component on the PPC, typical­ ly the instrument panel, steering bars, cart frame, or  any other cart component that can provide a horizon­ tal reference. Each design will have its own unique  reference.  

Exceeding the limitations specified in the regulations  or in the aircraft pilot operating handbook is consid­ ered aerobatics and not authorized by the manufac­ turer limitations.  

To initiate a turn, drag is created on the side of the  wing you want to turn via the steering control bar,  slowing and dropping that wing into the desired bank.  The side without the drag is flying faster and hence  pivots around the slower side. As discussed in Chap­ ter 2, the PPC is designed to track directly into the  relative air stream, similar to a weight-shift control  aircraft. Therefore, no rudder is needed to coordinate  a turn.  

A shallow bank produces a noticeable turn but you  likely will not notice an increase in load or airspeed.  A constant pressure is required on the steering bar to  maintain the bank angle for the turn. Abruptly releas­ ing the pressure on the foot bar would typically bring  the PPC back to straight flight because the pendulum  effect is so minor.  

A medium bank turn requires more PPC performance  than a shallow bank. Higher and noticeable loads,  plus noticeable airspeed increases are the result of  a medium bank turn. After the bank has been es­ tablished in a medium banked turn, pressure on the  steering control must be maintained to continue the  bank. If the control pressure is released, the PPC will  return to the level position because of the pendulum  stability discussed in Chapter 2. If it is a medium bank  angle, such as 40 degrees, and the pressure is released  abruptly, there will be some dampening oscillations  until the PPC returns to level flight. Slower responses  are required so the bank angle is reduced gradually  to maintain “coordinated pendulum effect.” All PPCs  have unique flying characteristics, but generally, low­ er performance “rectangular” wings would dampen  quicker than higher performance “elliptical” wings.  

To maintain altitude during a turn, you must direct­ ly coordinate the amount of steering input with the  amount of throttle increase because of the loss in ver­ tical lift, as covered in Chapter 2. To make a shallow  turn, only a modest amount of steering control input  and throttle increase is required. As the steering in­ put is applied, you will also simultaneously apply the  corresponding amount of throttle increase to maintain  level flight throughout the turn.  

The greater the bank angle, the greater the throttle re­ quired to remain in level flight. Also, with increased  bank, greater skill is required to reduce the pendulum  effect when coming out of the turn or reversing the  direction of the turn. [Figure 6-5]  

![](images/1ae7b8c6147da4faa5210940b967ac6e67b62eff9256f9209dcf798b6604bee4.jpg)  

# Figure 6-5. To turn, coordinate increased throttle with foot  steering input.  

To stop the turn and return to straight-and-level flight,  you need to smoothly release the steering control  input to achieve pendulum effect coordination. The  pendulum stability of the PPC will do the rest to re­ turn to the straight flightpath.  

All PPC controls should be manipulated with a smooth  and slow motion. This will prevent pilot induced os­ cillation (PIO). Whether you are pushing the throttle  forward to increase the pitch angle, or pushing the  steering control to induce a turn, both controls should  be operated smoothly and slowly—whether applying  input or removing it. [Figure 6-6]  

The rate at which a PPC turns is directly related to  the amount of steering control input. The more input,  the quicker the rate of turn. Be advised, however, if  full steering input is used and adequate throttle is not

Figure 6-6. Push the foot control and pull the steering line  smoothly and slowly.  

used to compensate, the vertical component of lift is  reduced significantly and a rapid descent will ensue as  the turn progresses.  

# Common Errors for Level Turns  

•	 Failure to adequately clear the area before  beginning the turn. •	 Attempting to sit up straight, in relation to the  ground, during a turn, rather than maintaining  posture with the cart.  •	 Insufficient feel for the PPC. •	 Gaining proficiency in turning in only one  direction; not practicing turns in both directions. •	 Failure to coordinate the throttle with the  steering controls. •	 Altitude gain/loss during the turn. •	 Too great of a bank angle.  

# Climbs and Climbing Turns, Descents  and Descending Turns  

To gain altitude, increase engine RPM. To lose al­ titude, decrease engine RPM. When a PPC enters a  climb, it changes flight path from level or descending  (with level or declined planes) to ascending with an  inclined plane. [Figure 6-7]  

Straight climbs are achieved by increasing throttle  above the level flight setting and holding a straight  heading. Climbing turns require more throttle than  straight climbs.  

During any descent, the pilot must clear the area be­ low and to the turning side (if applicable) before be­ ginning these maneuvers.  

![](images/aad9cb925376ad06135fd35eef020a8db453feca26218e42ae0e8284d5725237.jpg)  
Figure 6-7. When a PPC stabilizes in a climb or descent, the flight path is a declined or inclined plane.  

To descend, reduce throttle below the straight and  level RPM while flying straight or in a turn.  

Throttle reduction is the basis for determining the  descent rate. Banking the aircraft will also increase  the descent rate. Greater bank angles result in greater  descent rates.  

# Gliding  

A glide is a basic maneuver in which the PPC loses  altitude in a controlled descent with little or no engine  power.  

The PPC glide ratio is the distance the aircraft will  travel forward in relation to the altitude it loses. For  instance, if the aircraft travels 3,000 feet forward while  descending 1,000 feet, its glide ratio is said to be 3 to  1. Wind is a major influence on the gliding distance  in relationship to the PPC movement over the ground.  With a tailwind, the PPC will glide farther, perhaps a  5 to 1 glide ratio because of the higher groundspeed.  Conversely, with a headwind or a crosswind, the air­ craft will not glide as far, perhaps a 2 to 1 glide ratio,  because of the slower groundspeed.  

Typically, a PPC is designed to fly efficiently near the  best lift to drag ratio. Adding flare will normally de­ crease your speed by increasing your drag and angle  of attack, reducing your glide ratio. Do not attempt to  “stretch” a glide by applying flare and reducing the  airspeed. Attempts to stretch a glide will invariably  result in an increase in the descent rate and angle of  descent.  

A stabilized power-off descent is referred to as a nor­ mal glide. The flight instructor, while demonstrating a  normal glide, should direct the pilot to note:  

•	 sounds made by the PPC, •	 no steering control is required except to  maintain intended direction, and •	 feel of the powered parachute.  

# Wing Trim  

The powered parachute is designed so there is no  pressure needed on the flight steering controls, thus,  no pulling on the trailing edge when the PPC is flying  along normally. If properly trimmed, the PPC will fly  straight with no pilot input except for slight variations  due to left-turning tendencies. If the PPC is flying out  of this basic balanced condition, one of the steer­ ing controls can be pulled down and slight pressure  applied on the side to reduce the speed of the faster  side wing with a trim lock to temporarily relieve the  pilot of constant steering input. This trim lock is a  mechanical device the pilot can set on the ground or  in flight. [Figure 6-8] It holds the pressure on the side  that needs it so the pilot does not have to continually  apply pressure. Due to the inefficiency of increased  drag, the constant use of trim locks should not be a  replacement for a well set up and properly trimmed  wing. Most PPCs are currently not equipped with trim  locks but this will depend on the specific manufactur­ er and make/model. An improperly-trimmed PPC can  quickly produce pilot tension and fatigue, requiring  constant pressure on one of the steering bars.  

![](images/2bea67f154a6a31e72dc7b7826f185b8c7ea707349a728178bf70b137645b923.jpg)  
Figure 6-8. The right trailing edge is pulled down slightly  using the trim system, to correct for the left-turning  tendency.  

Most powered parachute incidents occur during the  takeoff. This is because unlike most other types of air­ craft, a powered parachute needs to create the airfoil  before flight can be attempted. This critical process  happens during the takeoff roll. The importance of  thorough knowledge, faultless technique, and judg­ ment cannot be overemphasized.  

# Terms and Definitions  

Although the takeoff and climb is one continuous ma­ neuver, it will be divided into four separate steps for  purposes of explanation:  

•	  Equipment staging  — the portion of the  takeoff procedure during which the powered  parachute is positioned and the chute is set up  for takeoff.  •	  Takeoff roll (ground roll)  — the portion of the  takeoff procedure during which the powered  parachute is accelerated from a standstill to an  airspeed that provides sufficient lift for it to  become airborne.  •	  Rotation and liftoff  — enough lift is on the  wing to rotate the nose wheel and lift the  powered parachute off the ground. •	  Initial climb  — begins when the powered  parachute leaves the ground and a rate of climb  is established.  

Normally, the process is considered complete when  the powered parachute has reached a safe maneu­ vering altitude, or an enroute climb has been estab­ lished.  

# Laying Out the Wing  

Refer to Chapter 5 to understand wing  inspection , a  separate procedure from wing  layout . There are sev­ eral ways to successfully lay out a powered parachute  wing. What an instructor teaches is usually determined  by the terrain, wind conditions, wing shape, and per­ sonal preference. There are two major layout meth­ ods: the inverted method and the stacked method.  

![](images/432595ef835869af7f265ac3e26a35d60a3d772802de0c69f094e7abffd4c08f.jpg)  
Figure 7-1. The inverted method of laying out the wing.  

# The Inverted Method  

The inverted method of laying out a wing involves  spreading it out with the bottom surface of the wing  facing up like a blanket on the beach. [Figure 7-1] The  trailing edge of the wing is positioned closest to the  cart and the leading edge is pulled out as far behind  the cart as it will lay without pulling the cart back­ wards.  

This method allows for a clear inspection of the wing  and the attachment points of the suspension lines. It  also allows the propeller blast on most carts to go over  the wing, keeping it from inflating too early.  

The main advantage to the inverted method is that  when the cart rolls forward on the takeoff roll, it  pulls the leading edge (A-lines) before it pulls the  other suspension lines. This allows for a quick in­ flation of the wing. However, the inverted method  is prone to lifting at the edges of the wing when  there is wind. The wind can get under the corners  of the wing and blow it up and back before you are  ready to take off which can delay the proper infla­ tion of the wing during the takeoff roll. Keep in mind  that if the wind is blowing hard enough to lift the  wing from its layout position, the flight conditions
 should be reviewed before continuing with the flight. The inverted method of laying out the wing.  

# The Stacked (or Accordion) Method  

The stacked method of laying out a wing involves  piling the wing up like an accordion with all of the  suspension lines stretched out as far as possible to the  rear of the cart. [Figure 7-2] The pilot can choose to  change from the inverted layout to the stacked method  on days where a slight wind is blowing or if the pilot  is concerned with the condition of the takeoff area.  Pavement or areas of the ground not covered in grass  in the takeoff runway will make it necessary to get  the wing off the ground with as little ground drag as  possible to avoid tearing or jeopardizing the integrity  of the wing fabric and/or lines.  

![](images/d0f8fb711915f0f493435ff8a2e69c4a31e2f6c3ee18c0e464728c3812d1f4c2.jpg)  
Figure 7-2. The stacked method of laying out the wing.  

With the wing spread out in the inverted configuration  and the lines inspected, you can pull the cart forward  to tighten all of the lines. This will begin the stacking  process. When the slack has been removed from all  lines, the pilot then goes back to the wing and finishes  the stacking process by hand. This usually means tak­ ing the trailing edge of the wing and tucking it under  the rest of the wing.  

To complete the process of stacking the wing there are  two options for laying out the leading edge. Generally,  if there is no wind you may want to leave the leading  edge open on top of the stack. If it is a little windy,  take the leading edge and tuck it behind and under the  rest of the wing. By “hiding” the leading edge over  and under the rest of the wing, the wind will blow  over the top of the stacked wing without catching the  open edges of the wing cells. When you start the take­ off roll, the leading edge is pulled forward and up, is  exposed to airflow and begins a quick inflation.  

# Cockpit Management  

The FAA regulations require the pilot to brief each per­ son on board on how to fasten and unfasten his or her  seatbelt and, if installed, shoulder harness. This pas­ senger briefing should be accomplished before start­ ing the engine, to include information on the proper  use of safety equipment and exiting the aircraft. You  should also inform the passenger as to what to expect  during takeoff, flight, and landing, what feelings and  jolts are normal, what to do if the cart should roll over,  and what to do if the engine fails. Make sure passen­ gers are aware of the hazards and risks of a moving  propeller and educate them on the necessity of keep­ ing items secured so they don’t get sucked through the  propeller. Help them to secure their helmets (if worn)  and explain how to control the intercom. Show them  where to put their hands and feet and make sure any  cameras or equipment are secure. A passenger should  be aware that an aborted takeoff is always a possibil­ ity. Tell them everything depends upon the wing­ —if  the wing does not inflate properly, or does not inflate  and rotate in time to take off and clear an obstacle, the  engine will be shut down. Finally, emergency proce­ dures should be discussed. At a minimum, it should  be explained that in the case of a rollover, the pas­ senger should keep arms and legs inside the protected  areas of the cart. In case of an accident, the passen­ ger should not be holding onto a part of the structure  that could hit the ground or an obstacle and hurt their  hand or any other part of their body. The informed  passenger is a safe passenger and one that will enjoy  the flight.  

After entering the cart, you should first ensure that  all necessary equipment, documents, checklists, and  navigation charts appropriate for the flight are on  board and secure. If a portable intercom, headsets, or  a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) is used,  the pilot is responsible for ensuring that the routing of  wires and cables does not interfere with the motion  or the operation of any control. Regardless of what  materials will be used, they should be neatly arranged  and organized in a manner that makes them readily  available. Loose items should be properly secured to  ensure nothing goes through the propeller or departs  the aircraft. All pilots should form the habit of good  housekeeping.  

When you are comfortably seated, fasten the safety  belt and shoulder harness and adjust to a comfortably  snug fit. The shoulder harness must be worn at least  for the takeoff and landing, although because of the  open cockpit, it is highly recommended both pilot and  passenger wear seat belts at all times. If the seats are  adjustable, it is important to ensure the seat is locked  in position. Accidents have occurred as the result of  seat movement during acceleration or pitch attitude  changes during takeoffs or landings. When the seat  suddenly moves too close or too far away from the  controls, you may be unable to maintain control of the  powered parachute.  

# Before Takeoff Check  

The before takeoff check is the systematic procedure  for making a final check of the engine, controls, sys­ tems, instruments, and avionics prior to flight. In ad­ dition, it gives the pilot an opportunity to establish a  go or no-go decision. The engine temperatures should  be rechecked, especially if any considerable amount  of time has passed since the engine warm-up was  completed, to make sure the engine and fluids are still  within the manufacturers’ recommended minimums.  If the air temperature is cold, the engine will cool  down faster than when the air temperature is warmer;  take a few minutes to bring the engine temperature  back up to minimums. Recheck the wind direction. If  the wind has changed, adjust your takeoff position so  you remain into the wind. Double check the steering  and suspension lines are not in the way of the forward  movement of the tires and the steering lines are not  tangled in the riser cables.  

# Start the Engine/Initial Rollout  

Prime the engine, if so equipped, switch magnetos to  the ON position, recheck that the throttle is not open  beyond idle, and turn the electric master switch to the  ON position. Visually check the area, shout “CLEAR  PROP” and start the engine. Monitor the engine tem­ peratures and check security of harnesses and hel­ mets. Check that the strobe lights are ON, electric  fuel pump is ON (if applicable), oil pressure is within  limits (if applicable), and complete a final ignition  system check.  

Once again, the pilot has this opportunity to establish  a go or no-go decision point. Check the intended run­ way and traffic pattern for existing traffic, and if radio  equipped and a nontowered airport, announce field,  type of aircraft, runway heading, and flight intentions;  if a tower-controlled airport, contact ground or tower  control to request a departure clearance. By adding  thrust smoothly to about half to three-quarter throttle,  the powered parachute will begin the takeoff roll.  

# Wing Inflation and Kiting  

During the takeoff roll of an airplane, the goal is to  build sufficient airflow over the wing to generate the  lift required to lift the aircraft off the ground. Powered  parachutes have two goals during the takeoff roll: to  pressurize and raise the wing overhead making sure  proper inflation exists for takeoff, and to create the  airflow over the wing to generate the necessary lift.  [Figure 7-3]  

![](images/ee4473ad640f3c8425efa53121be7e536fb87fd8bc757deb9024f90e9a894004.jpg)  

Make a final check to confirm that the cart is pointed  in the right direction and nothing has moved into the  way. Look over your shoulder to observe the canopy  inflation. Advance the throttle smoothly and firmly  to about one-half to two-thirds takeoff power. Too  abrupt an application of power may cause the cart to  yank the wing too roughly forward. This can damage  the riser system and shorten wing life. This is more  of a problem with higher horsepower engines than in  lower powered aircraft. As the cart starts to roll for­ ward, make sure both feet are on the steering bars to  begin steering the parachute immediately.  

As the wing starts to rise off the ground and climb, it is  acting like a parachute with lots of drag; the cart does  not move forward much. As soon as the wing passes  through the  $50^{\circ}$   angle to the ground, the drag dramati­ cally decreases as the parachute becomes a wing and  the cart will begin to pick up forward speed very rap­ idly. You must reduce the engine thrust enough at this  point to prevent the powered parachute from becom­ ing airborne prematurely. If the initial thrust reduction  is too great, the wing will begin to lose pressurization  and settle back to the ground. If the thrust reduction  is not adequate, the powered parachute will continue  to accelerate and become airborne. On occasion the  wing can become locked-out, or stuck in the prop  wash; easing back on the throttle will allow the wing  to settle out of the prop wash. Once again, easing  the throttle smoothly forward will assist the wing in  climbing through the prop wash and climb overhead  above the fuselage.  

As the wing is coming up in back of the cart, one side  of the wing may inflate and rise faster than the other  side. That higher side should be given a little bit of  steering control to allow the other side of the wing  to catch up. If you don’t make the correction early,  the wing will want to fly over to the slower-inflating  side. This may create wing oscillations, especially if  combined with too slow a takeoff speed. While it is  important to not over-control, remember that wing  controls during kiting are sluggish and more control  inputs are needed than during flight.  

Now is the most critical point during takeoff and pos­ sibly during the entire flight. While the parachute is  inflating and rising overhead, most of the powered  parachute’s weight is still being carried by the wheels  and the suspension system. The goal is to get the wing  overhead and then transition the load from the wheels  to the wing.  

During the inflation and takeoff roll, you need to divide  your attention between the direction the cart is going  and the wing. When the wing is overhead, perform  the “rolling preflight.” You need to quickly inspect the  wing to make sure it is fully inflated and there are no  line-overs, end cell closures, pressure knots, or huge  oscillations before adding full power for takeoff. This  all has to be done with quick glances.  

Line-overs are very easy to detect because the wing  will be obviously deformed and look like it is pinched  by the line that is over the top of the wing. If you see  a line-over, shut down and set up again.  

End cells of the wing not inflating are something ad­ ditional to watch for. Most powered parachute wings  have large cross-venting in the cells to allow the  entire wing to pressurize evenly. Generally, the wing  will pressurize in the middle first. As the pressure  evens out across the wing sometimes the end cells of  the wing simply do not want to inflate. It is impera­ tive that the pilot visually sees end cells inflate before  taking off. Sometimes all you have to do is wait for  the end cells to open. On some wing configurations it  is recommended that the steering tubes be “pumped”  lightly to help open the end cell openings.  

Pressure knots are harder to determine during a rolling  preflight. It may be very hard to see what is going on  with the lines themselves, so the pilot may find it bet­ ter to look for deformations on the bottom surface of  the wing caused by one line being pulled more than it  should be. Trying to take off with a pressure knot will  result in the powered parachute turning very sharply  to the side of the pressure knot. It will be nearly im­ possible to correct for that turn without nearly stalling  the wing with the input on the other side. The engine  will have to be kept at a very high setting just to main­ tain what little altitude is gained.  

Wing oscillations occur for several reasons. There  may not have been enough power added initially to  kite the wing, or the pilot may have waited too long  to correct for a wing that was flying to one side. Some  light oscillation is okay, and will merely lift one side  of the powered parachute into the air before the oth­ er. On the other hand large oscillations will actually  change the lift from a straight upward vector to an  upward and side-pulling force. An oscillating wing  forced into takeoff will most likely roll the airframe,  which is an undesirable cause and effect.  

Oscillations are easier to prevent with good inflation  techniques than they are to correct. However, if a  wing is oscillating, it is possible to correct by steering  the wing opposite to the side that the wing is drift­ ing towards. In other words, manage the wing, steer  it straight. The wrong inputs can make the problem  worse. If the oscillations become too severe, it is best  to abort the takeoff and set up again.  

It is critical for the wing and lines to become verified,  or fully inflated, directly overhead and centered, with  the lines free of tangles. An acronym of LOC is often  used to verify the wing is ready for takeoff: L – Lines  Free, O – Cells Open, C – Wing Centered. Once the  wing is fully pressurized, centered above the cart and  the suspension and steering lines are free of tangles,  slowly increase the throttle to takeoff thrust. The in­ creased thrust accelerates the powered parachute for­ ward until the airflow over the wing generates enough  lift to get the PPC airborne. Continue to increase  throttle gradually to the desired pitch attitude. Your  feet have been resting on the steering bars throughout  all the ground operations, and can be used to steer.  

# Normal Takeoff  

A normal takeoff is one in which the powered para­ chute is headed into the wind and the wind is light  to moderate. [Figure 7-4] The takeoff surface should  be firm, free of debris, and not have any obstructions  along the takeoff path. The takeoff surface should  have sufficient length to permit the powered para­ chute to quickly accelerate to normal flight speed.  

There are three reasons for making a takeoff as di­ rectly into the wind as possible:  

1.	A slower ground speed reduces wear and stress  on the landing gear;

 	 2.	The headwind helps inflate the wing and get it  overhead more quickly;

 	 3.	A shorter ground roll, and therefore less runway  length, is required to lift off.

Figure 7-4. The powered parachute should be headed into  the wind during takeoff.  

# Takeoff Roll  

Once there is a commitment to take off, it takes a  minimum airspeed to keep the wing inflated. Inflating  the chute, then cutting the power, will usually result in  the wing deflating and falling to the ground. This can  be difficult to recover from and should only be done  if you wish to abort the takeoff.  

Otherwise, as the speed of the takeoff roll increases,  more and more pressure will be felt on the steering  control tubes. It is important during this time to keep  the wing going in the same direction as the cart. This  means using the ground controls and/or the flight con­ trols to keep the cart and the wing coordinated.  

After kiting the wing and performing the LOC pre­ flight check as discussed in Chapter 5, takeoff power  is applied and you accelerate to flying speed.  

# Rotation  

When the wing has enough lift to rotate the cart nose  off of the ground, nosewheel steering becomes inef­ fective. This means that even though the back wheels  of the machine are still on the ground, the cart will be  steered by the wing. You should not attempt any kind  of tight radius turn during this process.  

# Lift-Off  

Once the wing is overhead and enough power is add­ ed, the powered parachute will lift off the ground.  

# Initial Climb  

Once the cart is off the ground, it is important to main­ tain at least the same throttle setting that got it off the  ground in the first place. When the cart is free from  ground friction on the landing gear, it will begin to  climb.  

Once the powered parachute is off the ground, prop  torque may become noticeable. It will typically steer  the aircraft to the left (with a clockwise spinning pro­ peller). Wind can also affect the direction of the PPC  after liftoff. During initial climb, it is important that  the initial climb path remain aligned with the runway  to avoid drifting into obstructions, or the path of an­ other aircraft that may be taking off from a parallel  runway. Proper scanning techniques are essential to  a safe takeoff and climb, not only for maintaining at­ titude and direction, but also for collision avoidance  in the airport area.  

The powered parachute’s takeoff performance will be  much different when there is less weight with only  one person in the PPC. Due to decreased load, the  powered parachute will become airborne sooner,  climb more rapidly, climb at a much steeper angle,  and the flight controls may seem more sensitive.  

Common errors in the performance of normal take­ offs and departure climbs are:  

•	 Failure to adequately clear the area prior to  taxiing into the staging position. •	 Poor selection of a staging position. (Not  allowing for enough takeoff area.) •	 Failure to set up the powered parachute into the  wind. •	 Abrupt use of the throttle resulting in additional  stress on the wing during inflation. •	 Not using enough power to kite the wing. •	 Failure to observe the wing during inflation. •	 Failure to perform the rolling LOC preflight to  clear the wing.  

•	 Abrupt use of the throttle resulting in the  aircraft porpoising. •	 Failure to anticipate the left turning tendency  (as discussed in Chapter 2) on initial  acceleration. •	 Overcorrecting for left turning tendency.  

# Centering the Wing  

The steering controls can be used to reduce the wing’s  side-to-side oscillation, or assist with the centering of  the wing during the rolling (takeoff) preflight. For ex­ ample, if the wing is far left of center, and is beginning  to move back to center (from left to right) you can add  some left control pressure to slow the wing’s (right  moving) inertia and thus keep it from overshooting  the center position above the cart. Or, if the wing is  far right of center and you want to begin the wing’s  motion back to its normal and safe position above the  cart, you could help initiate the wing’s motion to the  left by applying slight left steering pressure.  

# Encourage Cell Openings  

During the pretakeoff roll (when building and verify­ ing your wing before takeoff—particularly if operat­ ing on a soft field) you may find it useful to press  the pedals multiple times, and hold it (about half a  second) after the wing comes overhead. This has  two beneficial uses. First, it assists with opening the  outside cells by temporarily increasing internal wing  pressure, pushing the air forward and transfering the  pressure out to the tips. Second, it helps confirm the  steering lines are clear of any impediments, ensuring  they are not caught on  or wrapped around any outrig­ ger tubing or obstructions.  

# “Lock-out” Avoidance  

Improper canopy layout, wind conditions, or inappro­ priate throttle movements during the initial building  of the wing during your takeoff roll may cause the  wing to “lock-out” or stall behind the cart at a 30 to 45  degree angle on its rise. To correct the lock-out, reduce  power and push both steering controls simultaneously  out in a flaring motion until the wing is pulled back  to where the tail is almost touching the ground. Then  rapidly release the flare so the wing “sling-shots” up  and overhead of the cart. Note: This method is not  recommended with elliptical shaped wings, as these  wings, with their reduced drag, may over-fly the cart  and land ahead of the rolling cart.  

# Crosswind Takeoff  

Powered parachutes have very limited crosswind ca­ pability. You should take off directly into the wind. If  the wind is slowly changing direction and the powered  parachute is positioned to take off into a crosswind, it  is better to wait and see if the winds will change back  to headwinds before committing to a takeoff. If winds  are changing direction very quickly, the flight should  be cancelled.  

Sometimes there is only one runway and the winds  are blowing across it. It is still possible to take off,  but it will involve positioning the powered parachute  so the initial inflation and roll will be into the wind. If  you fly at a field that has only one main runway, you  must be familiar with the principles and techniques  involved in crosswind takeoffs or not fly when there  is a crosswind.  

# Positioning the Cart  

In all but the lightest of crosswinds, it is still a good  idea to position the powered parachute into the  wind. Lay out the powered parachute wing directly  into the wind, as you would for a normal takeoff.  [Figure 7-5]  

![](images/350c3e184000e1137e8e8c51dff4ec3cf4de70358cc3f968571fa55829e7e0f2.jpg)  

# Figure 7-5. Initial inflation.  

# Wing Inflation and Kiting  

The initial inflation and kiting should be done as it  would be for a normal takeoff. As soon as the wing is  overhead and flying, steer the cart into the direction  desired for takeoff. This procedure requires practice  coordinating the controls for the ground steering and  the wing. The wing needs to be producing some lift  before the turn can be attempted. This may mean a  more aggressive inflation and kiting if the takeoff area  is relatively small.  

# Takeoff Roll  

The technique used during the initial takeoff roll in  a crosswind is generally the same as used in a nor­ mal takeoff, the wing should be turned approximately  into the wind; this is done with steering bar control  held to the side from which the crosswind is blowing.  This will help keep the wing from pulling the cart to  the down wind side. It is important there is sufficient  airspeed over the wing to create lift. Otherwise, the  wing will have a tendency to fall towards the down­ wind side of the powered parachute. This exposes the  powered parachute to a rollover since the wind will be  blowing into the bottom of the wing that is now acting  as a sail, thereby pulling the cart over.  

The sequence of events will usually be moving fast  during a crosswind takeoff, but it is still important to  do a rolling preflight: LOC.  

# Lift-Off  

As the nosewheel is being raised off the runway, the  steering control for the powered parachute is trans­ ferred fully to the wing flight controls.  

If a significant crosswind exists, it will take longer for  the powered parachute to take off because the steering  control adds drag to the wing. This may be naturally  compensated for by the headwind component of the  wind as well as the tendency for the deflected side of  the wing to act as a flared wing.  

As both main wheels leave the runway and ground  friction no longer resists drifting, the powered para­ chute will be slowly carried sideways with the wind  unless you maintain adequate drift correction. There­ fore, it is important to establish and maintain the prop­ er amount of crosswind correction prior to lift-off by  continuing to apply steering bar pressure.  

# Initial Climb  

If proper crosswind correction is being applied, as  soon as the powered parachute is airborne, the cart  will rotate so it is lined up with the wing. Firm and  aggressive use of the steering bars may be required  to keep the powered parachute crabbed down the in­ tended takeoff path. Continue the climb with a wind  correction angle to follow a ground track aligned  with the runway centerline or takeoff path direction.  However, because the force of a crosswind may vary  markedly within a few hundred feet of the ground,  make frequent checks of actual ground track, and ad­ just the crab angle as necessary. The remainder of the  climb technique is the same used for normal takeoffs  and climbs.  

Common errors in the performance of crosswind  takeoffs are:  

•	 Failure to adequately clear the area prior to  taxiing into the staging position. •	 Poor selection of a staging position.  •	 Not allowing for enough takeoff area. •	 Not allowing for enough area to kite the wing  and turn to the intended takeoff path. •	 Failure to set up the powered parachute into the  wind. •	 Not using enough power to kite the wing. •	 Failure to observe the wing during inflation. •	 Failure to perform a rolling preflight (LOC). •	 Failure to maintain enough thrust to keep  the wing properly loaded during the turn and  alignment with the intended takeoff path.  

# Rejected Takeoff/Engine Failure  

Emergency or abnormal situations can occur during  a takeoff that will require you to reject the takeoff  while still on the runway. Circumstances such as a  malfunctioning powerplant, inadequate acceleration,  inadequate wing kiting, runway incursion, or air traf­ fic conflict may be reasons for a rejected takeoff.  

Prior to takeoff, you should have in mind a point along  the runway at which the powered parachute should  be airborne. If that point is reached and the powered  parachute is not airborne, take immediate action to  discontinue the takeoff. Properly planned and execut­ ed, chances are excellent the powered parachute can  be stopped on the remaining runway without using  extraordinary measures, such as excessive braking or  trying to stop by using your feet as brakes. Neither  of these measures should be used and may result in  powered parachute damage and/or personal injury. In  the event a takeoff is rejected, reduce the power to idle  and shut down the engine. Immediately, pull down the  trailing edge to collapse the wing so it can be used as  a drogue chute, semi-inflated behind you.  

Urgency characterizes all power loss or engine failure  occurring after lift-off. In most instances, the pilot has  only a few seconds after an engine failure to decide  and execute the proper course of action. In the event  of an engine failure on initial climb-out, the powered  parachute will be at a high pitch angle, with the cart  well in front of the wing. When the engine fails, the  cart will rock back under the parachute, possibly caus­ ing a temporary but potentially dangerous dive. The  level of danger in the dive is dependent on how high  the PPC is above the ground when the engine fails.  The best situation is if the pilot can establish a normal  glide and execute a normal engine-out landing (see  Chapter 12). However, if the engine-out occurs close  to the ground, it may be necessary to immediately  flare the parachute so the parachute does not rotate  over the cart and into a dive which will increase the  descent rate.  

# Runway Surface and Gradient  

Runway conditions affect takeoff performance. Typi­ cally, powered parachutes take off from level grassy  surfaces. However, runway surfaces vary widely from  one airport to another. The runway surface for a spe­ cific airport is noted in the Airport/Facility Directory  (A/FD). Any surface that is not hard and smooth will  increase the ground roll during takeoff. This is due  to the inability of the tires to smoothly roll along the  surface. Tires can sink into soft, grassy, or muddy  runways. Holes or other ruts in the surface can be  the cause of poor tire movement along the surface.  Obstructions such as mud, snow, or standing water  reduce the powered parachute’s acceleration down  the runway. Many of these same hindrances are mul­ tiplied in effect by the use of soft or wide tires that  increase resistance themselves.  

The gradient or slope of the runway is the amount of  change in runway height over the length of the run­ way. The gradient is expressed as a percentage such  as a 3 percent gradient. This means that for every 100  feet of runway length, the runway height changes by  3 feet. A positive gradient indicates that the runway  height increases, and a negative gradient indicates that  the runway decreases in height. An upsloping runway  impedes acceleration and results in a longer ground  run during takeoff. A downsloping runway aids in ac­ celeration on takeoff resulting in shorter takeoff dis­ tances. Runway slope information is contained in the  Airport/Facility Directory.  

# Takeoff Performance  

Takeoff performance is partly a condition of acceler­ ated motion. For instance, during takeoff, the pow­ ered parachute starts at zero speed and accelerates to  inflate the wing, then to takeoff speed and becomes  airborne. The important factors of takeoff perfor­ mance are as follows:  

•	 The takeoff speed. •	 The rate of acceleration during the takeoff roll. •	 The takeoff roll distance is a function of both  acceleration and speed.  

The minimum takeoff distance is of primary interest  in the operation of any powered parachute because  it defines the runway requirements. The minimum  takeoff distance is obtained by taking off on a length  of runway that allows sufficient margin to inflate the  wing, perform the LOC procedure, and then satisfac­ tory room to initiate a lift-off and climb.  

The powerplant thrust is the principal force providing  the acceleration and — for minimum takeoff distance  — the output thrust should be at the maximum after  the wing is inflated and successful LOC procedure pre­ formed. Use smooth, gradual throttle settings to avoid  porpoising. Drag is produced as soon as the powered  parachute moves forward. The drag of the wing de­ creases as it rotates into position over the cart.  

In addition to the important factors of proper proce­ dures, many other variables affect the takeoff perfor­ mance of a powered parachute. Any item that alters  the takeoff speed or acceleration rate during the take­ off roll will affect the takeoff distance.  

The most important variable to affect the takeoff  performance is how fast the pilot can get the wing  overhead, centered, and ready to take the load of the  cart. Often, most of the runway used will be for the  inflation and wing LOC procedure. Unlike almost any  other type of flight, a powered parachute pilot has to  create the airfoil and clear it on the ground before lift­ off. It is always best to practice this skill at a longer  field where mistakes can be made and corrected in  plenty of time before taking off.  

Even a slight headwind will have a dramatic effect  on takeoff distances for powered parachutes because  a wind helps inflate a wing much faster than can be  done on a calm day. Even light winds can be a large  percentage of the flying speed of a powered parachute.  A powered parachute that flies at   $35~\mathrm{mph}$   taking off  into a headwind of only 3.5 mph is working with a 10  percent headwind. A headwind that is 10 percent of  the takeoff airspeed will reduce the takeoff distance  approximately 19 percent. In the case where the head­ wind is 50 percent of the takeoff speed (a brisk 17.5  mph), the takeoff distance would be approximately 25  percent of the zero wind takeoff distance (75 percent  reduction).  

Gross weight also has an effect on takeoff distance.  Proper consideration of this item must be made in  predicting the powered parachute’s takeoff distance.  Increased gross weight can be considered to produce  a threefold effect on takeoff performance:  

1.	Higher lift-off speed,

 	 2.	Greater mass to accelerate, and

 	 3.	Increased retarding force (drag and ground  friction).  

If the gross weight increases, a greater speed is re­ quired to produce the greater lift necessary to get the  powered parachute airborne at the takeoff lift coef­ ficient. As an example of the effect of a change in  gross weight for a typical PPC, a 21 percent increase  in takeoff weight will require a 10 percent increase in  lift-off speed to support the greater weight.  

A change in gross weight will change the net acceler­ ating force and the mass that is being accelerated.  

The takeoff distance will vary at least as the square  of the gross weight. Adding a 200-pound passenger  to a machine that already weighs 400 pounds, with  a pilot weighing 200 pounds, will increase the gross  weight by 33 percent. That increase of one passenger  will degrade the performance of the powered para­ chute dramatically. The 33 percent increase in takeoff  gross weight would cause:  

•	 At least a 25 percent decrease in rate of  acceleration, and •	 At least a 76 percent increase in takeoff  distance.  

For the powered parachute with a high thrust-to- weight ratio, the increase in takeoff distance might be  approximately 76 percent, but for the powered para­ chute with a relatively low thrust-to-weight ratio, the  increase in takeoff distance would be more. Such a  powerful effect requires proper consideration of gross  weight in predicting takeoff distance.  

The effect of pressure altitude and ambient tempera­ ture is to define primarily the density altitude and its  effect on takeoff performance. While subsequent cor­ rections are appropriate for the effect of temperature  on certain items of powerplant performance, density  altitude defines specific effects on takeoff perfor­ mance. An increase in density altitude can produce a  fourfold effect on takeoff performance:  

1.	Greater takeoff speed.

 	 2.	Decreased thrust and reduced net accelerating  force.

 	 3.	Reduced rate of climb.

 	 4.	Increased runway required.  

If a powered parachute of given weight and configura­ tion is operated at greater heights above standard sea  level, it will still require the same dynamic pressure  to become airborne. Thus, the powered parachute at  altitude will take off at the same indicated airspeed as  at sea level, but because of the reduced air density, the  true airspeed will be greater.  

Proper accounting of pressure altitude (field elevation  is a poor substitute) and temperature is mandatory for  accurate calculation of takeoff roll distance.  

The most critical conditions of takeoff performance  are the result of some combination of high gross  weight, altitude, temperature, and unfavorable wind.  In all cases, the pilot must make an accurate calcu­ lation of takeoff distance from the performance data  of the AFM/POH, regardless of the runway avail­ able, and strive for a polished, professional takeoff  procedure. In the calculation of takeoff distance from  the AFM/POH data, the following primary consider­ ations must be given:  

•	 Pressure altitude and temperature — to define  the effect of density altitude on distance. • 	Gross weight — a large effect on distance. • 	Wind — a large effect on wing inflation and  overall distance. • 	Runway slope and condition — the effect of an  incline and the retarding effect of factors such  as snow, ice, or uncut grass.  

# Noise Abatement  

Aircraft noise problems have become a major concern  at many airports throughout the country. Many local  communities have pressured airports into developing  specific procedures that will help limit aircraft noise  while operating over nearby areas. For years now, the  FAA, airport managers, aircraft operators, pilots, and  special interest groups have been working together to  minimize aircraft noise for nearby sensitive areas. As  a result, noise abatement procedures have been devel­ oped for many of these airports that include standard­ ized profiles and procedures to achieve these lower  noise goals.  

Standard noise abatement procedures don’t necessar­ ily apply to powered parachutes, but similar issues  exist. Powered parachutes fly at lower altitudes, fly  tighter patterns, and tend to fly early in the morning  and late in the evening when the winds are lightest.  Powered parachute pilots should actively work with  airport management to determine takeoff areas, pat­ terns, and procedures that emphasize both safety and  good neighborhood relations.  

Specific noise abatement flight procedures are found  in the A/FD where runway surface, slope and eleva­ tion can be found for flight planning.  

This chapter introduces the various classifications  of airspace and provides information on the require­ ments to operate in such airspace. For further infor­ mation, consult the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Information,  the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regula­ tions (14 CFR) parts 71, 73, and 91.  

Powered parachutes (PPC) share the airspace with  all other types of aircraft and must avoid the flow  of fixed wing aircraft. Although most PPCs fly low,  slow and close to the field, you must be aware of the  airspace in which you are operating. Each type of air­ space has communication, equipment, visibility and  cloud clearance requirements, and therefore may re­ quire additional pilot training with logbook endorse­ ments. Some airspace may not be accessible (Class A)  while other airspace (Class B and Class C) may not  be prudent for PPC operation. Knowing the types of  airspace and their requirements is necessary for safe  and proper PPC operations.  

The two categories of airspace are: regulatory and  non-regulatory. Within these two categories, there are  four types: controlled, uncontrolled, special use, and  other airspace.  

Each type of airspace may have different minimum  pilot certification, equipment, visibility and cloud  clearance, and entry requirements.  

Figure 8-1 presents a profile view of the dimensions  of various airspace classes. Figure 8-2 provides the  basic weather minimums for operating in the different  airspace classes. Figure 8-3 lists the operational and  equipment requirements. Refer to these figures as you  review this chapter.  

# Controlled Airspace  

Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the  different classifications of airspace and defined di­ mensions within which air traffic control service is  provided in accordance with the airspace classifica­ tion. Controlled airspace consists of Class A, Class B,  Class C, Class D, and Class E.  

# Class A Airspace  

Class A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000  feet mean sea level (MSL) up to and including 60,000  feet (FL600), including the airspace overlying the  

![](images/484316473488497b6525060cc344a59ba762f1986aab0db565a2a0396859b72a.jpg)  

waters within 12 nautical miles (NM) of the coast of  the 48 contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise  authorized, all operation in Class A airspace will be  conducted under instrument flight rules (IFR). It is not  likely PPCs will be operated in Class A airspace.  

# Class B Airspace  

Class B airspace is generally the airspace from the  surface to 10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s  busiest airports. The configuration of Class B airspace  is individually tailored to the needs of a particular  area and consists of a surface area and two or more  layers. Some Class B airspace resembles an upside- down wedding cake. At least a private pilot certificate  is required to operate in Class B airspace; however,  there is an exception to this requirement. Student pi­ lots, recreational pilots, and sport pilots may operate  in the airspace if they have received training and a  logbook endorsement by an authorized flight instruc­ tor in accordance with 14 CFR part 61.  

With proper communication equipment, a Mode C  transponder (a device that transmits your exact posi­ tion and altitude), pilot certification and endorsements  as required, and an air traffic control (ATC) clearance,  a powered parachute may operate in Class B airspace.  Due to large jets and congested traffic operating in  Class B airspace, powered parachute operations may  not be advised.  

![](images/76c4e3143afe8e0b8f6c85c8fa4b0f7312e0fb64d58e583e5a7a299adf3c5185.jpg)  

When associated with Class B airspace and within 30  nautical miles of the primary airport, aircraft must be  equipped with a Mode C transponder. This require­ ment must be complied with even if there is no intent  to enter the Class B airspace.  

# Class C Airspace  

Class C airspace generally surrounds those airports  having an operational control tower, are serviced by  a radar approach control, and with a certain number  of instrument flight (IFR) operations or passenger  enplanements. This airspace is charted in mean sea  level feet. Although the configuration of each Class  C airspace is individually tailored, the airspace usu­ ally consists of a   $5~\mathrm{{NM}}$   radius core surface area that  extends from the surface up to 4,000 feet above the  airport elevation, and a   $10~\mathrm{{NM}}$   radius shelf area that  extends no lower than 1,200 feet up to 4,000 feet above  the airport elevation. Though not requiring regulatory  action, Class C airspace areas have a procedural Outer  Area. Normally this area is  $20~\mathrm{{NM}}$   from the primary  Class C airspace airport. Within the outer area, pilots  are encouraged to participate but it is not a VFR re­ quirement. With proper communication equipment, a  Mode C transponder, endorsements as required, and  two-way communications established, a powered  parachute may operate in Class C airspace though it  may still not be advisable. A Mode C transponder is  also required for overflying the Class C airspace.  

# Class D Airspace  

Class D airspace is for smaller airports operating with  a control tower and generally extends from the surface  to 2,500 feet above the airport elevation surrounding  those airports that have an operational control tower.  The configuration of Class D airspace will be tailored  to meet the operational needs of the area. At many  Class D airports, the airspace is configured as a circle  with a 4 nautical mile radius around the primary air­ port. Some are keyhole shaped. With the proper com­ munication equipment, endorsements as required,  and two-way communications established with ATC,  a powered parachute may operate within Class D. If  advised by ATC to remain clear of the Class D air­ space the powered parachute pilot must comply and  remain clear of the Class D airspace. Alternatives may  include circumnavigating the Class D airspace and/or  landing at an alternative airport.  

# Class E Airspace  

Class E airspace is generally controlled airspace that  is not designated A, B, C, or D. Except for 18,000 feet  MSL, Class E airspace has no defined vertical limit,  but rather it extends upward from either the surface  or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent  controlled airspace. With visibility and cloud clear­ ance requirements met, powered parachute operations  are not restricted. Most PPC operations take place in  Class E airspace.  

![Figure 8-3. Requirements for airspace operations from 14 CFR 61.325.  ](images/afc8daf0d9000128e10fac05ed19cff0fc7330217a5cd0a9614a2017bfc22042.jpg)  

# Uncontrolled Airspace: 
 Class G Airspace  

Uncontrolled or Class G airspace is the portion of the  airspace that has not been designated as Class A, B,  C, D, or E. It is therefore designated uncontrolled air­ space. Class G airspace extends from the surface to  the base of the overlying Class E airspace. Although  air traffic control has no authority or responsibility to  control air traffic in Class G airspace, you should re­ member there are visual flight rule (VFR) minimums  (visibility and cloud clearance) which apply to Class  G airspace.  

# Special Use Airspace  

Special use airspace exists where activities must be  confined because of their nature. In special use air­ space, limitations may be placed on aircraft that are  not a part of the activities. Special use airspace usu­ ally consists of:  

•	 Prohibited Areas.  •	 Restricted Areas.  •	 Warning Areas.  •	 Military Operation Areas.  •	 Alert Areas.  •	 Controlled Firing Areas.  

It is important you review the current sectional chart  for the area you will be flying in to make sure you  avoid operating in special use airspace without proper  training and authority. [Figure 8-4]  

# Prohibited Areas  

Prohibited areas are established for security or other  reasons associated with the national welfare. Prohib­ ited areas are published in the Federal Register and  are depicted on aeronautical charts.  

# Restricted Areas  

Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, of­ ten invisible hazards to aircraft such as artillery firing,  aerial gunnery, or guided missiles. An aircraft may  not enter a restricted area unless permission has been  obtained from the controlling agency. Restricted areas  are depicted on aeronautical charts and are published  in the Federal Register. Restricted areas may have  altitude limitations and hours of operation. Aircraft  operations are not restricted if the restricted area is  not active.  

![](images/a26c7895b5df84957e28e4bf6a06279ad79f249055ce9c715cc3031e643c3f1e.jpg)  
Figure 8-4. Your preflight preparations should include  studying the sectional chart to determine in which  airspace you will be operating.  

# Warning Areas  

Warning areas consist of airspace which may contain  hazards to non participating aircraft in international  airspace. The activities may be much the same as  those for a restricted area. Warning areas are estab­ lished beyond the 3-mile limit. Warning areas are de­ picted on aeronautical charts.  

# Military Operation Areas  

Military operation areas (MOA) consist of airspace of  defined vertical and lateral limits established for the  purpose of separating certain military training activity  from IFR traffic. There is no restriction against a pilot  operating VFR in these areas; however, a pilot should  be alert since training activities may include acrobatic  and abrupt maneuvers. MOAs are depicted on aero­ nautical charts. MOAs may have altitude limitations  and hours of operation.  

# Alert Areas  

Alert areas are depicted on aeronautical charts and  advise pilots that a high volume of pilot training or  unusual aerial activity is taking place. You should be  particularly vigilant while flying in this airspace due  to the high volume of training activities.  

# Controlled Firing Areas  

Controlled firing areas contain activities, which, if  not conducted in a controlled environment, could be  hazardous to non participating aircraft. The difference  between controlled firing areas and other special use  airspace is that activities must be suspended when a  spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout position indi­ cates an aircraft might be approaching the area.  

# Other Airspace Areas  

“Other airspace areas” is a general term referring to  the majority of the remaining airspace. It includes:  

•	 Airport Advisory Areas. •	 Military Training Routes (MTR).  •	 Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs). •	 Parachute Jump Areas.  •	 Published VFR Routes.  •	 Terminal Radar Service Areas.  •	 National Security Areas.  •	 Flights over Charted U.S. Wildlife Refuges,  Parks, and Forest Service Areas.  

# Airport Advisory Areas  

An airport advisory area is an area within 10 statute  miles (SM) of an airport where a control tower is not  operating, but where a flight service station (FSS) is  located. At these locations, the FSS provides advisory  service to arriving and departing aircraft.  

# Military Training Routes  

Military training routes (MTR) are developed to allow  the military to conduct low-altitude, high speed train­ ing. The routes above 1,500 feet AGL are developed  to be flown primarily under IFR, and the routes 1,500  feet and less are for VFR flight. The routes are identi­ fied on sectional charts by the designation “instrument  (IR) or visual (VR).” MTRs with no segment above  1,500 feet AGL are identified by four number charac­ ters; e.g., IR1206, VR1207. MTRs that include one or  more segments above 1,500 feet AGL are identified  by three number characters; e.g., IR206, VR207.  

# Temporary Flight Restrictions  

An FDC Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) will be issued  to designate a temporary flight restriction (TFR). The  NOTAM will begin with the phrase “FLIGHT RE­ STRICTIONS” followed by the location of the tem­ porary restriction, effective time period, area defined  in statute miles, and altitudes affected. The NOTAM  will also contain the FAA coordination facility and  telephone number, the reason for the restriction,  and any other information deemed appropriate. You  should check the NOTAMs as part of flight planning.  Flight Service (1-800-WX-BRIEF) can advise you on  current TFRs.  

Some of the purposes for establishing a temporary  restriction are:  

•	 Protect persons and property in the air or on the  surface from an existing or imminent hazard.  •	 Provide a safe environment for the operation of  disaster relief aircraft.  •	 Prevent an unsafe congestion of sightseeing  aircraft above an incident or event, which may  generate a high degree of public interest.  •	 Protect declared national disasters for  humanitarian reasons in the State of Hawaii.  •	 Protect the President, Vice President, or other  public figures.  •	 Provide a safe environment for space agency  operations.  

# Parachute Jump Areas  

Parachute jump areas are published in the Airport/
 Facility Directory. Sites that are used frequently are  depicted on sectional charts.  

# Published VFR Routes  

Published VFR routes are for transitioning around,  under, or through some complex airspace. Terms such  as VFR flyway, VFR corridor, Class B airspace, VFR  transition route, and terminal area VFR route have  been applied to such routes. These routes are gener­ ally found on VFR terminal area planning charts.  

# Terminal Radar Service Areas  

Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA) are areas  where participating pilots can receive additional ra­ dar services. The purpose of the service is to provide  separation between all IFR operations and participat­ ing VFR aircraft.  

The primary airport(s) within the TRSA become(s)  Class D airspace. The remaining portion of the TRSA  overlies other controlled airspace, which is normally  Class E airspace beginning at 700 or 1,200 feet and  established to transition to/from the en route terminal  environment. TRSAs are depicted on VFR sectional  charts and terminal area charts with a solid black line  and altitudes for each segment. The Class D portion is  charted with a blue segmented line.  

Participation in TRSA services is voluntary; however,  pilots operating under VFR are encouraged to con­ tact the radar approach control and take advantage of  TRSA service.  

# National Security Areas  

National security areas consist of airspace of defined  vertical and lateral dimensions established at locations  where there is a requirement for increased security  and safety of ground facilities. Pilots are requested to  voluntarily avoid flying through these depicted areas.  When necessary, flight may be temporarily prohib­ ited.  

National security areas can be changed to TFRs with  very little notice. Check the status of the airspace  with the FSS before flying through a national security  area.  

# Flight Over Charted U.S. Wildlife  Refuges, Parks, and Forest Service  Areas  

The landing of aircraft is prohibited on lands or waters  administered by the National Park Service, U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service, or U.S. Forest Service without  authorization from the respective agency. Exceptions  include:  

1.	When forced to land due to an emergency beyond  the control of the operator;

 	 2.	At officially designated landing sites; or

 	 3.	An approved official business of the Federal 
 Government.  

Pilots are requested to maintain a minimum altitude of  2,000 feet above the surface of the following: Nation­ al Parks, Monuments, Seashores, Lakeshores, Recre­ ation Areas and Scenic River ways administered by  the National Park Service, National Wildlife Refuges,  Big Game Refuges, Game Ranges and Wildlife Rang­ es administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,  and Wilderness and Primitive areas administered by  the U.S. Forest Service.  

# Powered Parachute Operations  

PPC preflight planning should include a review of the  airspace that will be flown. A local flight may be close  to the field and include only Class G and Class E air­ space. Minimum visibility and cloud clearance may  be the only requirements for both the pilot and the  powered parachute.  

If you will be flying through controlled airspace, you  must determine if the PPC meets all of the equipment  requirements of that airspace. [Figure 8-3] You must  also review your qualifications to determine if you  meet the minimum pilot requirements of the airspace.  If you or the PPC do not meet the minimum aircraft  and/or pilot requirements of the airspace, then the  preflight planning should include a course around the  airspace. Extra time and fuel will be required for the  circumnavigation and should be taken into consider­ ation prior to departure. With proper preflight plan­ ning, transition or circumnavigation of the controlled  airspace should not be a problem for the pilot or the  powered parachute.  

# PPC and Air Traffic Control  

In uncontrolled airspace separation from other air­ craft is the responsibility of the pilot. Separation from  higher speed traffic may require flight paths different  than faster traffic. The PPC pilot may be asked to ex­ pedite or deviate from a traditional course. The PPC  pilot must work with ATC in advising of the airspeed  limitations and surface wind speed and direction limi­ tations. Safe operation in controlled airspace requires  that the controller understand the limits of the pow­ ered parachute.  

In uncontrolled airspace the responsibility for separa­ tion from other aircraft is the responsibility of the pilot.  The PPC pilot must be aware that the pilot of the other  aircraft may not understand the requirements and/or  limitations of the PPC. In operations at uncontrolled  airports 14 CFR part 91 requires that PPCs avoid the  flow of fixed-wing aircraft.  

Regardless of the airspace, see and avoid is a key ele­ ment of flying in a PPC. The slow speed of the PPC al­ lows it to be overtaken by higher performance aircraft  quickly. Vigilance and proper scanning techniques are  extremely important in all airspace, particularly when  operating around nontowered airports.  

# Navigating the Airspace  

Knowledge of airspace dimensions, requirements to  enter the airspace and geographical location of the  airspace is the responsibility of all pilots. The current  sectional chart is the primary official tool to determine  the airspace you are flying within or trying to avoid.  

Pilotage is navigation by reference to landmarks to  determine your location and the location of airspace.  Pilotage is the best form of navigation to ensure that  you avoid airspace you are not authorized to enter.  Locating your position on the sectional chart and  locating/identifying the airspace you want to enter/ avoid requires preflight planning on the ground and  situational awareness in the air.  

GPS is a very popular form of navigation use by pow­ ered parachute pilots. The GPS receiver is small, sim­ ple to use and inexpensive compared to other forms  of electronic (radio) navigation. Simple modes of  operation and the aviation database give the pilot a  considerable amount of information about the flight,  the terrain and Class B, C and D airspace, and spe­ cial use airspace. Many pilots use GPS to determine  distance from airspace with restrictions and/or com­ munications requirements. When using GPS to avoid  airspace, allow for a buffer between the aircraft and  the airspace. The aviation database in the GPS may  not exactly match the airspace as depicted on the sec­ tional chart. If there is a difference between the sec­ tional chart and GPS information, the sectional chart  should be considered the correct information.  

A PPC pilot using GPS should ensure that the bat­ teries are fresh and the aviation database is current.  Never rely entirely on the GPS for navigation. Always  back up GPS by using pilotage with a sectional chart  and checkpoints when flying beyond visual range of  a familiar airport. In addition, the GPS should be se­ cured in the powered parachute so it does not depart  the cart, nor touch the propeller before it stops.  

# Purpose and Scope  

Ground reference maneuvers and their related factors  are used in developing a high degree of pilot skill.  Although most of these maneuvers are not performed  as such in normal everyday flying, the elements and  principles involved in each are applicable to perfor­ mance of the customary pilot operations. They aid the  pilot in analyzing the effect of wind and other forces  acting on the powered parachute, and in developing a  fine control touch and the division of attention neces­ sary for accurate and safe powered parachute maneu­ vering.  

All of the early part of the pilot’s training has been  conducted for the purpose of developing technique,  knowledge of maneuvers, feel, and the handling of the  powered parachute in general. This training will have  required that most of the pilot’s attention be given to  the actual handling of the powered parachute, and the  results of control pressures on the action of the pow­ ered parachute.  

If permitted to continue beyond the appropriate train­ ing stage, however, the student pilot’s concentration  of attention will become a fixed habit, one that will  seriously detract from the student’s ease and safety as  a pilot, and will be very difficult to eliminate. There­ fore it is necessary, as soon as the pilot shows profi­ ciency in the fundamental maneuvers, that the pilot be  introduced to maneuvers requiring outside attention  on a practical application of these maneuvers and the  knowledge gained.  

During ground reference maneuvers, it is important  that basic flying technique previously learned be  maintained. The flight instructor should not allow  any relaxation of the student’s previous standard of  technique simply because a new factor is added. This  requirement should be maintained throughout the  student’s progress from maneuver to maneuver. Each  new maneuver should embody some advance and in­ clude the principles of the preceding one in order that  continuity is maintained. Each new factor introduced  should be merely a step-up of one already learned so  that orderly, consistent progress can be made.  

# Maneuvering by Reference to  Ground Objects  

Ground track or ground reference maneuvers are  performed at a relatively low altitude while apply­ ing wind drift correction as needed to follow a pre­ determined track or path over the ground. They are  designed to develop the ability to control the powered  parachute and to recognize and correct for the effect  of wind while dividing attention among other matters.  This requires planning ahead of the powered para­ chute, maintaining orientation in relation to ground  objects, flying appropriate headings to follow a de­ sired ground track, and being cognizant of other air  traffic in the immediate vicinity.  

Pilots should perform clearing turns prior to begin­ ning a maneuver. The essential idea of the clearing  turn is to be certain that the next maneuver is not go­ ing to proceed into another aircraft’s flightpath. Some  pilot training programs have hard and fast rules, such  as requiring two   $90^{\circ}$   turns in opposite directions be­ fore executing any training maneuver. Other types of  clearing procedures may be developed by individual  flight instructors. Whatever the preferred method, a  clearing procedure should be used. Execute the ap­ propriate clearing procedure before all turns and be­ fore executing any training maneuver. Proper clearing  procedures, combined with proper visual scanning  techniques, are the most effective strategy for colli­ sion avoidance.  

Ground reference maneuvers should be flown so as  not to descend below 200 feet above the ground. The  actual altitude will depend on a number of factors.  You should plan and fly the maneuver so as not to  descend below an altitude of 200 feet above ground  level (AGL); however you must also plan and fly so as  not to come closer than 500 feet to any person, vessel,  vehicle or structure.  

•	 The radius of the turn and the path of the  powered parachute over the ground should be  easily noted and changes planned and effected  as circumstances require. •	 Drift should be easily discernable, but not tax  the student too much in making corrections. • 	The altitude should be low enough to render  any gain or loss apparent to the student, but  in no case closer than 500 feet to the highest  obstruction or lower then 200 feet above the  ground.  

During these maneuvers, both the instructor and the  student should be alert for available forced-landing  fields. The area chosen should be away from com­ munities, livestock, or groups of people to prevent  possible annoyance or hazards to others. Due to the  altitudes at which these maneuvers are performed,  there is little time available to search for a suitable  field for landing in the event the need arises.  

# Drift and Ground Track Control  

Whenever any object is free from the ground, it is  affected by the medium with which it is surrounded.  This means that a free object will continue to move in  its current direction and speed unless acted upon by  another force. For example, if a powerboat is cross­ ing a river and the river is still, the boat could head  directly to a point on the opposite shore and travel on  a straight course to that point without drifting. How­ ever, if the river were flowing swiftly, the water cur­ rent would have to be considered. That is, as the boat  progresses forward with its own power, it must also  move upstream at the same rate the river is moving  it downstream. This is accomplished by angling the  boat upstream sufficiently to counteract the down­ stream flow. If this is done, the boat will follow the  desired track across the river from the departure point  directly to the intended destination point. Should the  boat not be headed sufficiently upstream, it would  drift with the current and run aground at some point  downstream on the opposite bank. [Figure 9-1]  

As soon as a powered parachute becomes airborne,  it is free of ground friction. Its path is then affected  by the air mass in which it is flying; therefore, the  powered parachute (like the boat) will not always  track along the ground in the exact direction that it is  headed. When flying with the longitudinal axis of the  powered parachute aligned with a road, the powered  parachute may get closer to or farther from the road  without any turn having been made. This would indi­ cate the air mass is moving sideward in relation to the  powered parachute. Since the powered parachute is  flying within this moving body of air (wind), it moves  or drifts with the air in the same direction and speed,  just like the boat moved with the river current. [See  Figure 9-1]  

![](images/72fbc9f9cc47630317c425762c00ccdd184393952e01c78b4410ace05a2b1e99.jpg)  

When flying straight and level and following a select­ ed ground track, the preferred method of correcting  for wind drift is to head the powered parachute suf­ ficiently into the wind to cause the powered parachute  to move forward into the wind at the same rate the  wind is moving it sideways. Depending on the wind  velocity, this may require a large wind correction an­ gle or one of only a few degrees. When the drift has  been neutralized, the powered parachute will follow  the desired ground track.  

To understand the need for drift correction during  flight, consider a flight with a wind velocity of 30  knots from the left and   $90°$   to the direction the pow­ ered parachute is headed. After 1 hour, the body of air  in which the powered parachute is flying will have  moved  $30~\mathrm{{NM}}$   to the right. Since the powered para­ chute is moving with this body of air, it too will have  drifted   $30~\mathrm{{NM}}$   to the right. In relation to the air, the  powered parachute moved forward, but in relation to  the ground, it moved forward as well as  $30\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   to the  right.  

There are times when the pilot needs to correct for  drift while in a turn. [Figure 9-2] Throughout the turn  the wind will be acting on the powered parachute from  constantly changing angles. The relative wind angle  and speed govern the time it takes for the powered  parachute to progress through any part of a turn. This  is due to the constantly changing groundspeed. When  the powered parachute is headed into the wind, the  groundspeed is decreased; when headed downwind,  the groundspeed is increased. Through the crosswind  portion of a turn, the powered parachute must be  turned sufficiently into the wind to counteract drift.  

To follow a desired circular ground track, the wind  correction angle must be varied in a timely manner  because of the varying groundspeed as the turn pro­ gresses. The faster the groundspeed, the faster the  wind correction angle must be established; the slow­ er the groundspeed, the slower the wind correction  angle must be established. You will see then that the  PPC should have the steepest bank and fastest rate of  turn on the downwind portion of the turn and have  the shallowest bank and slowest rate of turn on the  upwind portion.  

The principles and techniques of varying the angle  of bank to change the rate of turn and wind correc­ tion angle for controlling wind drift during a turn are  the same for all ground track maneuvers involving  changes in direction of flight.  

When there is no wind, it should be simple to fly along  a ground track with an arc of exactly   $180^{\circ}$   and a con­ stant radius because the flightpath and ground track  would be identical. This can be demonstrated by ap­ proaching a road at a   $90°$   angle and, when directly  over the road, rolling into a medium-banked turn, then  maintaining the same angle of bank throughout the   $180^{\circ}$   of turn. [Figure 9-2]  

To complete the turn, the rollout should be started at a  point where the canopy will become level as the pow­ ered parachute again reaches the road at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle  and will be directly over the road just as the turn is  completed. This would be possible only if there were  absolutely no wind and if the angle of bank and the  rate of turn remained constant throughout the entire  maneuver.  

If the turn were made with a constant angle of bank  and a wind blowing directly across the road, it would  result in a constant radius turn through the air. How­ ever, the wind effects would cause the ground track  to be distorted from a constant radius turn or semicir­ cular path. The greater the wind velocity, the greater  would be the difference between the desired ground  track and the flightpath. To counteract this drift, the  

![](images/45194bc91ff26b87be1dba4f4e9ba05a82f016d04528822d1d31366c7ec37e92.jpg)

Figure 9-3. Effect of wind during turns.  

flightpath can be controlled by the pilot in such a man­ ner as to neutralize the effect of the wind, and cause  the ground track to be a constant radius semicircle.  

The effects of wind during turns can be demonstrated  after selecting a road, railroad, or other ground refer­ ence that forms a straight line parallel to the wind. Fly  into the wind directly over and along the line and then  make a turn with a constant medium angle of bank  for  $360^{\circ}$   of turn. [Figure 9-3] The powered parachute  will return to a point directly over the line but slightly  downwind from the starting point, the amount de­ pending on the wind velocity and the time required to  complete the turn. The path over the ground will be an  elongated circle, although in reference to the air, it is  a perfect circle. Straight flight during the upwind seg­ ment after completion of the turn is necessary to  bring  the powered parachute back to the starting position.  

A similar  $360^{\circ}$   turn may be started at a specific point  over the reference line, with the powered parachute  headed directly downwind. In this demonstration, the  effect of wind during the constant banked turn will  drift the powered parachute to a point where the line  is re-intercepted, but the   $360^{\circ}$   turn will be completed  at a point downwind from the starting point.  

Another reference line which lies directly crosswind  may be selected and the same procedure repeated,  showing that if wind drift is not corrected the pow­ ered parachute will, at the completion of the   $360^{\circ}$  turn, be headed in the original direction but will have  drifted away from the line a distance dependent on the  amount of wind.  

From these demonstrations, you will see where and  why it is necessary to increase or decrease the angle  of bank and the rate of turn to achieve a desired track  over the ground. The principles and techniques in­ volved can be practiced and evaluated by the perfor­ mance of the ground track maneuvers discussed in  this chapter.  

# Rectangular Course  

Normally, the rectangular course is the first ground  reference maneuver the pilot is introduced to. [Figure 9-4]  

The rectangular course is a training maneuver in  which the ground track of the powered parachute is  equidistant from all sides of a selected rectangular  area on the ground. The maneuver simulates the con­ ditions encountered in an airport traffic pattern. While  performing the maneuver, the altitude should be held  constant.  

The maneuver assists the student pilot in perfecting:  

• 	Practical application of the turn. • 	The division of attention between the flightpath,  ground objects, and the handling of the powered  parachute. • 	The timing of the start of a turn so that the turn  will be fully established at a definite point over  the ground. • 	The timing of the recovery from a turn so that a  definite ground track will be maintained. • 	The establishing of a ground track and the  determination of the appropriate “crab” angle.  

Like those of other ground track maneuvers, one of  the objectives is to develop division of attention be­ tween the flightpath and ground references, while  controlling the powered parachute and watching for  other aircraft in the vicinity. Another objective is to  develop recognition of drift toward or away from a  line parallel to the intended ground track. This will be  helpful in recognizing drift toward or from an airport  runway (landing area) during the various legs of the  airport traffic pattern.  

For this maneuver, a square or rectangular field, or an  area bounded on four sides by section lines or roads,  should be selected well away from other air traffic.  The powered parachute should be flown parallel to  and at a uniform distance from the field boundaries,  not necessarily directly above the boundaries. For best  results, the flightpath should be positioned outside the  field boundaries just far enough that they may be eas­ ily observed from either pilot seat by looking out the  side of the powered parachute. If an attempt is made  to fly directly above the edges of the field, the pilot  will have no usable reference points to start and com­ plete the turns. The closer the track of the powered  parachute is to the field boundaries, the steeper the  

![](images/d7af0da6046a46800785e5716265cb29c074deae17b0f73066b959f0751acd68.jpg)

bank necessary at the turning points. Also, the pilot  should be able to see the edges of the selected field  while seated in a normal position and looking out the  side of the powered parachute during either a left- hand or right-hand course. The distance of the ground  track from the edges of the field should be the same  regardless of whether the course is flown to the left or  right. All turns should be started when the powered  parachute is abeam the corner of the field boundaries  headed downwind where ground reference maneuvers  are typically started. These should be the determining  factors in establishing the distance from the boundar­ ies for performing the maneuver.  

Although the rectangular course may be entered from  any direction, this discussion assumes entry on a  downwind.  

On the downwind leg, the wind is a tailwind and re­ sults in an increased groundspeed. Consequently, the  turn onto the next leg is entered with a fairly fast rate  of turn and a higher (medium) bank. As the turn pro­ gresses, the bank angle is reduced gradually because  the tailwind component is diminishing, resulting in  a decreasing groundspeed. During and after the turn  onto this leg (the equivalent of the base leg in a traffic  pattern), the wind will tend to drift the powered para­ chute away from the field boundary. To compensate  for the drift, the amount of turn will be more than   $90°$  .  

The rollout from this turn must be such that as the  wing becomes level, the powered parachute is turned  slightly toward the field and into the wind to correct  for drift. The powered parachute should again be  the same distance from the field boundary and at the  same altitude, as on other legs. The base leg should be  continued until the upwind leg boundary is being ap­ proached. Once more the pilot should anticipate drift  and turning radius. Since drift correction was held on  the base leg, it is necessary to turn less than   $90^{\circ}$   to  align the powered parachute parallel to the upwind leg  boundary. This turn should be started with a medium  bank angle with a gradual reduction to a shallow bank  as the turn progresses. The rollout should be timed  to assure paralleling the boundary of the field as the  canopy becomes level.  

While the powered parachute is on the upwind leg, the  next field boundary should be observed as it is being  approached, to plan the turn onto the crosswind leg.  Since the wind is a headwind on this leg, it is reducing  the powered parachute’s groundspeed and during the  turn onto the crosswind leg will try to drift the pow­ ered parachute toward the field. For this reason, the  roll-in to the turn must be slow and the bank relative­ ly shallow to counteract this effect. As the turn pro­ gresses, the headwind component decreases, allowing  the groundspeed to increase. Consequently, the bank  angle and rate of turn are increased gradually to as­ sure that upon completion of the turn the crosswind  ground track will continue the same distance from the  edge of the field. Completion of the turn with the wing  level should be accomplished at a point aligned with  the upwind corner of the field.  

Simultaneously, as the wing is rolled level, the proper  drift correction is established with the powered para­ chute turned into the wind. This requires that the turn  be less than a   $90°$   change in heading. If the turn has  been made properly, the powered parachute should  be the same distance from the field boundary and  at the same altitude, as on other legs. While on the  crosswind leg, the wind correction angle should be  adjusted as necessary to maintain a uniform distance  from the field boundary.  

As the next field boundary is being approached, the  pilot should plan the turn onto the downwind leg.  Since a wind correction angle is being held into the  wind and away from the field while on the crosswind  leg, this next turn will require a turn of more than  $90°$  .  Since the crosswind will become a tailwind, caus­ ing the groundspeed to increase during this turn, the  bank initially should be medium and progressively  increased as the turn proceeds. To complete the turn,  the rollout must be timed so that the wing becomes  level at a point aligned with the crosswind corner of  the field just as the longitudinal axis of the powered  parachute again becomes parallel to the field bound­ ary. The distance from the field boundary should be  the same as from the other sides of the field.  

Usually, drift should not be encountered on the up­ wind or the downwind leg, but it may be difficult to  find a situation where the wind is blowing exactly  parallel to the field boundaries. This would make it  necessary to use a slight wind correction angle on all  the legs. It is important to anticipate the turns to cor­ rect for groundspeed, drift, and turning radius. When  the wind is behind the powered parachute, the turn  must be faster and steeper; when it is ahead of the  powered parachute, the turn must be slower and shal­ lower. These same techniques apply while flying in  airport traffic patterns.  

Common errors in the performance of rectangular  courses are:  

• 	Failure to adequately clear the area. • 	Failure to establish proper altitude prior to  entry. (Typically, entering the maneuver while  descending.) • 	Failure to establish appropriate wind correction  angle resulting in drift. • 	Gaining or losing altitude. • 	Abrupt control usage. • 	Inability to adequately divide attention between  powered parachute control, maintaining ground  track, and maintaining altitude.  • 	Improper timing in beginning and recovering  from turns.  • 	Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft.  

# S-Turns Across a Road  

An S-turn across a road is a practice maneuver in  which the powered parachute’s ground track de­ scribes semicircles of equal radii on each side of a  selected straight line on the ground. [Figure 9-5] The  straight line may be a road, fence, railroad, or section  line that lies perpendicular to the wind, and should  be of sufficient length for making a series of turns. A  constant altitude should be maintained throughout the  maneuver; do not go lower than 200 feet.  

S-turns across a road present one of the most elemen­ tary problems in the practical application of the turn  and in the correction for wind drift in turns. The appli­ cation of this maneuver is considerably less advanced  in some respects than the rectangular course. How­ ever it is taught after the student has been introduced  to the rectangular course in order that he or she may  have a knowledge of the correction for wind drift in  straight flight along a reference line, before attempt­ ing to correct for drift by applying a turn.  

The objectives of S-turns across a road are to develop  the ability to compensate for drift during turns, orient  the flightpath with ground references, follow an as­ signed ground track, arrive at specified points on as­ signed headings, and divide the pilot’s attention. The  maneuver consists of crossing the road at a  $90^{\circ}$   angle  and immediately beginning a series of   $180^{\circ}$   turns of  uniform radius in opposite directions, re-crossing the  road at a   $90°$   angle just as each   $180^{\circ}$   turn is completed.  

![](images/7b53a075f4e87c9da337fbe5ad1e79ea2e46860647cb2b75691fa74b14181ece.jpg)  
Figure 9-5. S-turns.  

To accomplish a constant radius ground track requires  a changing rate of turn and angle of bank to establish  the wind correction angle. Both will increase or de­ crease as groundspeed increases or decreases.  

The bank must be steepest when beginning the turn on  the downwind side of the road and must be shallowed  gradually as the turn progresses from a downwind  heading to an upwind heading. On the upwind side,  the turn should be started with a relatively shallow  bank and then gradually steepened as the powered  parachute turns from an upwind heading to a down­ wind heading. In this maneuver, the powered para­ chute should be rolled from one bank directly into the  opposite just as the reference line on the ground is  crossed.  

Before starting the maneuver, a straight ground ref­ erence line or road that lies   $90^{\circ}$   to the direction of  the wind should be selected, then the area should be  checked to ensure that no obstructions or other air­ craft are in the immediate vicinity. The road should be  approached from the upwind side, at the selected alti­ tude on a downwind heading. When directly over the  road, start the first turn immediately. With the pow­ ered parachute headed downwind, the groundspeed is  greatest and the rate of departure from the road will  be rapid; so the roll into the bank must be fairly rapid  to attain the proper wind correction angle. This pre­ vents the powered parachute from flying too far from  the road and from establishing a ground track of ex­ cessive radius. During the latter portion of the first   $90°$   of turn when the powered parachute’s heading is  changing from a downwind heading to a crosswind  heading, the groundspeed becomes less and the rate of  departure from the road decreases. The wind correc­ tion angle will be at the maximum when the powered  parachute is headed directly crosswind.  

After turning   $90^{\circ}$  , the powered parachute’s head­ ing becomes more and more an upwind heading,  the groundspeed will decrease, and the rate of clo­ sure with the road will become slower. If a constant  steeper bank were maintained, the powered parachute  would turn too quickly for the slower rate of closure,  and would be headed perpendicular to the road pre­ maturely. Because of the decreasing groundspeed and  rate of closure while approaching the upwind head­ ing, it will be necessary to gradually shallow the bank  during the remaining   $90°$   of the semicircle, so that the  wind correction angle is removed completely and the  wing becomes level as the   $180^{\circ}$   turn is completed at  the moment the road is reached.  

At the instant the road is being crossed again, a turn  in the opposite direction should be started. Since the  powered parachute is still flying into the headwind,  the groundspeed is relatively slow. Therefore, the turn  will have to be started with a shallow bank so as to  avoid an excessive rate of turn that would establish  the maximum wind correction angle too soon. The  degree of bank should be that which is necessary to  attain the proper wind correction angle so the ground  track describes an arc the same size as the one estab­ lished on the downwind side.  

Since the powered parachute is turning from an up­ wind to a downwind heading, the groundspeed will  increase and after turning   $90°$  , the rate of closure  with the road will increase rapidly. Consequently, the  angle of bank and rate of turn must be progressively  increased so that the powered parachute will have  turned   $180^{\circ}$   at the time it reaches the road. Again, the  rollout must be timed so the powered parachute is in  straight-and-level flight directly over and perpendicu­ lar to the road.  

Throughout the maneuver a constant altitude should  be maintained, and the bank should be changing con­ stantly to affect a true semicircular ground track.  

Often there is a tendency to increase the bank too  rapidly during the initial part of the turn on the up­ wind side, which will prevent the completion of the   $180^{\circ}$   turn before re-crossing the road. This is apparent  when the turn is not completed in time for the pow­ ered parachute to cross the road at a perpendicular  angle. To avoid this error, the pilot must visualize the  desired half circle ground track, and increase the bank  during the early part of this turn. During the latter part  of the turn, when approaching the road, the pilot must  judge the closure rate properly and increase the bank  accordingly, so as to cross the road perpendicular to it  just as the rollout is completed.  

Common errors in the performance of S-turns across  a road are:  

• 	Failure to adequately clear the area. • 	Gaining or losing altitude. • 	Inability to visualize the half circle ground  track. • 	Poor timing in beginning and recovering from  turns. • 	Faulty correction for drift. • 	Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft.  

# Turns Around a Point  

As a training maneuver turns around a point is a logi­ cal extension of the principles involved in the per­ formance of S-turns across a road. Its purposes as a  training maneuver are:  

• 	To further perfect turning technique. • 	To perfect the ability to subconsciously control  the powered parachute while dividing attention  between the flightpath and ground references. • 	To teach the student that the radius of a turn is a  distance which is affected by the degree of bank  used when turning with relation to a definite  object. • 	To develop a keen perception of altitude. • 	To perfect the ability to correct for wind drift  while in turns.  

In turns around a point, the powered parachute is  flown in a complete circle of uniform radii or distance  from a prominent ground reference point while main­ taining a constant altitude; do not go lower than 200  feet.  

The factors and principles of drift correction that are  involved in S-turns are also applicable in this maneu­ ver. As in other ground track maneuvers, a constant  radius around a point will, if any wind exists, require  a constantly changing angle of bank and wind correc­ tion angles. The closer the powered parachute is to a  direct downwind heading where the groundspeed is  greatest, the steeper the bank and the faster the rate  of turn required to establish the proper wind correc­ tion angle. The more nearly it is to a direct upwind  heading where the groundspeed is least, the shallower  the bank and the slower the rate of turn required to  establish the proper wind correction angle. It follows,  then, that throughout the maneuver the bank and rate  of turn must be gradually varied in proportion to the  groundspeed.  

The point selected for turns around a point should  be prominent, easily distinguished by the pilot,  and yet small enough to present precise reference.  [Figure 9-6] Isolated trees, crossroads, or other simi­ lar small landmarks are usually suitable.  

To enter turns around a point, the powered parachute  should be flown on a downwind heading to one side  of the selected point at a distance equal to the desired  radius of turn.  

When any significant wind exists, it will be necessary  to roll into the initial bank at a rapid rate so that the  steepest bank is attained abeam of the point when the  

![](images/18e11d034752460932d3829de367dc2a7d297366bd7c5389c82e9318926f9a92.jpg)  
Figure 9-6. Turns around a point.  

powered parachute is headed directly downwind. By en­ tering the maneuver while heading directly downwind,  the steepest bank can be attained immediately. There­ after, the bank is shallowed gradually until the point is  reached where the powered parachute is headed directly  upwind. At this point, the bank should be gradually  steepened until the steepest bank is again attained when  heading downwind at the initial point of entry.  

Just as S-turns require that the powered parachute be  turned into the wind in addition to varying the bank,  so do turns around a point. During the downwind half  of the circle, the powered parachute’s nose is progres­ sively turned toward the inside of the circle; during the  upwind half, the nose is progressively turned toward  the outside. The downwind half of the turn around  the point may be compared to the downwind side of  the S-turn across a road; the upwind half of the turn  around a point may be compared to the upwind side  of the S-turn across a road.  

As the pilot becomes experienced in performing turns  around a point and has a good understanding of the  effects of wind drift and varying of the bank angle  and wind correction angle as required, entry into the  maneuver may be from any point. When entering the  maneuver at a point other than downwind, however,  the radius of the turn should be carefully selected, tak­ ing into account the wind velocity and groundspeed  so that an excessive bank is not required later on to  maintain the proper ground track. The flight instructor  should place particular emphasis on the effect of an  incorrect initial bank.  

Common errors in the performance of turns around a  point are:  

•	 Failure to adequately clear the area. • 	Failure to establish appropriate bank on entry. • 	Failure to recognize wind drift. • 	Excessive bank and/or inadequate wind  correction angle on the downwind side of the  circle resulting in drift towards the reference  point. • 	Inadequate bank angle and/or excessive wind  correction angle on the upwind side of the circle  resulting in drift away from the reference point. • 	Gaining or losing altitude. • 	Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft. • 	Inability to direct attention outside the powered  parachute while maintaining precise powered  parachute control.

It is very important to note 14 CFR part 91 requires  powered parachutes to avoid the flow of fixed-wing  aircraft. Additional information on airport operations  can be found in the  Aeronautical Information Manual   (AIM) and the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge.  

# Airport Traffic Patterns and  Operations  

Every flight begins and ends at an airport; an airport,  as defined by the Federal Aviation Regulations, is an  area of land or water that is used or intended to be  used for the landing and takeoff of aircraft. For this  reason, it is essential you learn the traffic rules, pro­ cedures, and patterns that may be in use at various  airports.  

Most aviation accidents occur within a few miles of  the airport. This is where congestion is the heaviest  and the pilot is the busiest.  

“See and avoid” is critical for safe operations. Ad­ visories on the common traffic advisory frequency  (CTAF) are essential at nontower-controlled airports  and flying fields to advise other aircraft of your posi­ tion and intentions.  

To enhance safety around airports, specific traffic pat­ terns and traffic control procedures have been estab­ lished at airports. The traffic patterns provide specific  routes for takeoffs, departures, arrivals, and landings.  The exact nature of each airport traffic pattern is de­ pendent on the runway in use, wind conditions, ob­ structions, and other factors.  

Different traffic patterns at the same airport may be  established for heavy aircraft, general aviation aircraft,  gliders and light-sport aircraft (LSA) operations. The  largest factor in determining the proper traffic pattern  is airspeed. Slow aircraft do not mix well with fast air­ craft. The powered parachute is at the slow end of the  speed range of aircraft found around most airports.  Regardless of the traffic pattern flown, you must be  aware of your position relative to other aircraft in the  traffic pattern and avoid the flow of fixed-wing air­ craft. Helicopters fall under this same rule. This rule  frequently affects the choice for a landing site. Refer  to Chapter 5 for more information on selecting a land­ ing site and airport operation information.  

With that in mind, you must understand the standard  airport traffic pattern in use at the airport you are oper­ ating at and the traffic pattern you are flying to main­ tain separation from other aircraft traffic.  

Powered parachutes operate best from a grass surface,  due to less wear and tear on the canopy. However,  off-runway operation may disrupt normal airport op­ erations and may not be safe for the PPC due to poor  surface conditions. If an off-runway area is used for  PPC operations, examine the area for surface condi­ tion, holes, standing water, rocks, vegetation height,  moguls, fences, wires and other hazards.  

A traffic pattern may be established for an off-runway  operating area. The traffic pattern may not, and prob­ ably will not, conform to the airplane traffic pattern. It  is still your responsibility to avoid the flow of airplane  traffic.  

If you elect to use the airport runway, take into con­ sideration any crosswind that may be present. The air­ port runway may not be aligned close enough into the  wind for your flying skills or may exceed the canopy  limitations.  

The established powered parachute traffic pattern for  an airport might be similar to the standard traffic pat­ tern or it might use turns in the opposite direction.  [Figure 10-1] In both cases, use a standard rectangular  pattern with a pattern altitude one-half the airplane  traffic pattern altitude or as published (if published).  An airport may also use a smaller pattern, referred to  as a “tight pattern” or “inside pattern,” and it might be  in the same direction as the other traffic or opposite.  This smaller pattern combined with a pattern altitude  of one-half the airport traffic pattern helps ensure sep­

aration from aircraft flying much faster. It is important  to review the Airport/Facilities Directory (A/FD) and  understand the procedures used at each airport you  will be operating at.  

Airports vary in complexity from small, private grass  or sod strips to public major terminals having many  paved runways and taxiways. Regardless of the type  of airport or field, you must know and abide by the  rules and general operating procedures applicable to  the airport being used. These rules and procedures are  based not only on logic or common sense, but also on  courtesy. The objective is to keep air traffic moving  with maximum safety and efficiency. The use of any  traffic pattern, service, or procedure does not alter the  responsibility for you to see and avoid other aircraft.  

Control towers and radar facilities provide a means  of adjusting the flow of arriving and departing air­ craft, and render assistance to pilots in busy terminal  areas. You must be familiar with the communication  requirements for operating at airports where you op­ erate or indend to operate. [Figure 10-2]  

Airport lighting, markings, and signs are used fre­ quently to alert pilots to abnormal conditions and  hazards, provide directions, and assist pilots in air­ port operations. It is essential you understand and ad­ here to the information provided by these indicators.  [Figures 10-3 and 10-4]  

# Standard Airport Traffic Patterns  

The regulations require powered parachutes avoid the  flow of fixed-wing aircraft. This rule should be the  primary factor in deciding whether a standard airport  traffic pattern is appropriate for your operation.  

To assure that air traffic flows into and out of an air­ port in an orderly manner, an airport traffic pattern  is established appropriate to the local conditions, in­ cluding the direction and placement of the pattern, the  altitude to be flown, and the procedures for entering  and leaving the pattern. Unless the airport displays  approved visual markings indicating that turns should  be made to the right, you should make all turns in  the pattern to the left. Again, the airport may have  established a different pattern and altitude for LSA  operations; be sure to talk with the airport manager  and check the A/FD before heading to the airport.  

When operating at an airport with an operating con­ trol tower, you will receive by radio a clearance to  approach or depart, as well as pertinent information  

![](images/9e86419ae619e673cf674173c04b60aff87696cc035510312ed7a7e98cefdcd1.jpg)  

about the traffic pattern. If there is not a control tow­ er, it is your responsibility to determine the direction  of the traffic pattern, to comply with the appropriate  traffic rules, and to display common courtesy toward  other pilots operating in the area. The common traffic  advisory frequency (CTAF) is a good place to listen  for traffic at the airport. It is also important to listen  to the automatic terminal information service (ATIS)  if one is provided.  

You are not expected to have extensive knowledge of  all traffic patterns at all airports, but if you are famil­ iar with the basic rectangular pattern, it will be easy  to make proper approaches and departures from most  airports, regardless of whether they have control tow­ ers. Check the Airport/Facility Directory for airport  and traffic pattern information.  

At airports with operating control towers, the tower  operator may instruct you to enter the traffic pattern  at any point or to make a straight-in approach with­ out flying the usual rectangular pattern. Many other  deviations are possible if the tower operator and the  pilot work together in an effort to keep traffic moving  smoothly. Jets or heavy aircraft will frequently be fly­ ing wider and/or higher patterns than lighter aircraft,  and in many cases will make a straight-in approach  for landing.  

The standard general aviation (GA) rectangular traf­ fic pattern is illustrated in Figure 10-1. Traffic pattern  altitude can vary by airport and should be checked in  the Airport/Facility Directory. The GA pattern altitude  is typically  $800-1{,}000$   feet. The PPC should NOT be  flown at the GA pattern altitude. In an effort to avoid  airplanes, the PPC pattern altitude should be one-half  the GA pattern altitude. Even after the airplane has  slowed to traffic pattern speed, it is still 2 to 3 times  the PPC speed.  

When entering the traffic pattern at an airport with­ out an operating control tower, inbound pilots are ex­ pected to observe other aircraft already in the pattern  and to conform to the traffic pattern in use. If other  aircraft are not in the pattern, then traffic indicators  on the ground and wind indicators must be checked to  determine which runway and traffic pattern direction  should be used. Many airports have L-shaped traffic  

![](images/65f74ef1a6433da1981350ff1d84ea9a36fb35bff49e968b148b820f69d31730.jpg)

pattern indicators displayed with a segmented circle  adjacent to the runway. [Figure 10-5] The short mem­ ber of the L shows the direction in which the traffic  pattern turns should be made when using the runway  parallel to the long member. Check these indicators  while at a distance well away from any pattern that  might be in use, or while at a safe height well above  airport pattern altitudes. Once the proper traffic pat­ tern direction has been determined, you should then  proceed to a point well clear of the pattern before de­ scending to the pattern altitude.  

When approaching an airport for landing, the traffic  pattern should be entered at a  $45^{\circ}$   angle to the down­ wind leg, headed toward a point abeam of the mid­ point of the runway to be used for landing. Arriving  aircraft should be at the proper traffic pattern altitude  before entering the pattern, and should stay clear of  the traffic flow until established on the entry leg. En­ tries into traffic patterns while descending create spe­ cific collision hazards and should always be avoided.  

The entry leg should be of sufficient length to provide  a clear view of the entire traffic pattern, and to allow  you adequate time for planning the intended path in  the pattern and the landing approach.  

The downwind leg is a course flown parallel to the  landing runway, but in a direction opposite to the in­ tended landing direction. This leg should be at one- half the specified traffic pattern altitude to alleviate  conflicts with faster aircraft. During this leg, the be­ fore landing check should be completed. Maintain  pattern altitude until abeam the approach end of the  landing runway. At this point, reduce power and begin  a descent. The downwind leg continues past a point  abeam the approach end of the runway to a point ap­ proximately  $45^{\circ}$   from the approach end of the runway,  and a medium bank turn is made onto the base leg.  

![](images/5b1c61e445f3ef241c974b8dbb90dfd143470ec08bc579ce7827e50770c791f9.jpg)  

![](images/d33e5026358e22d17acb73daa37c801284e27251f2e5f3314f9a073f37a3f091.jpg)  
Figure 10-5. Segmented circle and components.  

The base leg is the transitional part of the traffic pattern  between the downwind leg and the final approach leg.  Depending on the wind condition, it is established at a  sufficient distance from the approach end of the land­ ing runway to permit a gradual descent to the intended  touchdown point. The ground track of the powered  parachute while on the base leg should be perpendicu­ lar to the extended centerline of the landing runway,  although the longitudinal axis of the powered para­ chute may not be aligned with the ground track when  it is necessary to turn into the wind to counteract drift.  While on the base leg, the pilot must ensure, before  turning onto the final approach, that there is no danger  of colliding with another aircraft that may already be  on the final approach.  

The final approach leg is a descending flightpath start­ ing from the completion of the base-to-final turn and  extending to the point of touchdown. This is prob­ ably the most important leg of the entire pattern, be­ cause here the pilot’s judgment and procedures must  be the sharpest to accurately control the airspeed and  descent angle while approaching the intended touch­ down point.  

As stipulated in 14 CFR part 91, section 91.113, air­ craft while on final approach to land or while landing  have the right-of-way over other aircraft in flight or  operating on the surface. When two or more aircraft  are approaching an airport for the purpose of landing,  the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way.  Pilots should not take advantage of this rule to cut in  front of another aircraft that is on final approach to  land, or to overtake that aircraft.  

The upwind leg is a course flown parallel and in the  same direction to the landing runway. The upwind leg  continues past a point abeam the departure end of the  runway where a medium bank   $90°$   turn is made onto  the crosswind leg.  

The upwind leg is also the transitional part of the traf­ fic pattern: the final approach, when a go-around is  initiated, and where climb attitude is established af­ ter lift-off. When a safe altitude is attained, the pilot  should commence a shallow bank turn to the cross­ wind leg of the airport. The go-around is flown much  as you would overtake an aircraft by passing the over­ taken aircraft on their right. This will allow better vis­ ibility of the runway for departing aircraft.  

The departure leg of the rectangular pattern is a  straight course aligned with, and leading from, the  takeoff runway. This leg begins at the point the pow­ ered parachute leaves the ground and continues until  the  $90^{\circ}$   turn onto the crosswind leg is started.  

On the departure leg after takeoff, continue climbing  straight ahead, and, if remaining in the traffic pattern,  commence a turn to the crosswind leg. The published  airport traffic pattern may describe the turn to cross­ wind by altitude or ground reference. Begin the turn  to crosswind after a positive rate of climb has been  established and sufficient altitude has been gained to  allow clearance from ground obstructions.  

If departing the traffic pattern, continue straight out  or exit with a  $45^{\circ}$   turn, to enter the upwind leg after a  positive rate of climb has been established and suffi­ cient altitude has been gained to allow clearance from  ground obstructions. Exit the upwind leg straight out.  Turning into the upwind leg allows the PPC to exit the  pattern and avoid airplanes in the traffic pattern. Care  should be taken not to turn into the path of an aircraft  in the upwind leg.  

If parallel operations are in place (i.e., airplanes on  the hard surface, powered parachutes on the grass), fly  a pattern that stays within the pattern of the airplane  traffic and does not cross the airplanes’ active runway.  In all cases, the powered parachute should not make  any turns until the pilot is certain it will not obstruct  any aircraft operating in either pattern.  

The crosswind leg is the part of the rectangular pattern  that is horizontally perpendicular to the extended cen­ terline of the takeoff runway and is entered by making  approximately a  $90^{\circ}$   turn from the upwind leg. On the  crosswind leg, the powered parachute proceeds to the  downwind leg position.  

Since takeoffs are usually made into the wind, the  wind will now be approximately perpendicular to  the powered parachute’s flightpath. As a result, the  powered parachute will have to be turned or headed  slightly into the wind while on the crosswind leg to  maintain a ground track that is perpendicular to the  runway centerline extension.  

The information in this chapter is specific to the pow­ ered parachute land class. Refer to the  Seaplane, Ski­ plane, and Float/Ski Equipped Helicopter Operations  Handbook  (FAA-8083-23) for information regarding  operation of a powered parachute category sea class  (PPCS) aircraft, as appropriate.  

# Normal Approach and Landing  

A normal approach and landing involves the use of  procedures for what is considered a normal situation;  that is, when engine power is available, the wind is  light or the final approach is made directly into the  wind, the final approach path has no obstacles, and the  landing surface is firm, level and of ample length to  gradually bring the powered parachute to a stop. The  selected landing point should be beyond the runway’s  approach threshold but within the first one-third por­ tion of the landing area.  

So you may better understand the factors that will  influence judgment and procedures, the last part of  the approach pattern and the actual landing will be  divided into five phases: the base leg, the final ap­ proach, the roundout, the touchdown, and the after- landing roll.  

The manufacturer’s recommended procedures, in­ cluding powered parachute configuration, center of  gravity, and other information relevant to approach­ es and landings in a specific make and model pow­ ered parachute are contained in the  Pilot’s Operating  Handbook  (POH) for that powered parachute. If any  of the information in this chapter differs from the  powered parachute manufacturer’s recommendations  as contained in the POH, the powered parachute man­ ufacturer’s recommendations take precedence.  

# Base Leg  

The placement of the base leg is one of the more im­ portant judgments made by the pilot in any landing  approach. [Figure 11-1] You must accurately judge  the altitude and distance from which a gradual descent  will result in landing at the desired spot. The distance  will depend on the altitude of the base leg and the  effect of wind. When there is a strong wind on final  approach, the base leg must be positioned closer to the  approach end of the runway than would be required  with a light wind. You should strive to fly a constant  ground track on base leg.  

Drift correction should be established and maintained  to follow a ground track perpendicular to the exten­ sion of the centerline of the runway on which the  landing is to be made. Since the final approach and  landing will normally be made into the wind, there  may be somewhat of a crosswind during the base leg.  This requires the powered parachute be angled suffi­ ciently into the wind to prevent drifting farther away  from the intended landing spot.  

The base leg should be continued to the point where  a medium to shallow-banked turn will align the pow­ ered parachute’s path directly with the centerline of  the landing runway. This descending turn should be  completed at a safe altitude that will be dependent  upon the height of the terrain and any obstructions  along the ground track. The turn to the final approach  should also be sufficiently above the airport elevation  to permit a final approach long enough for you to ac­ curately estimate the resultant point of touchdown.  This will require careful planning as to the starting  point and the radius of the turn. Normally, it is recom­ mended that the angle of bank not exceed a medium  bank because the steeper the angle of bank, the faster  the powered parachute descends. Since the base-to- final turn is often made at a relatively low altitude, it  is important not to do radical turns at low altitude. If  a significant bank is needed to prevent overshooting  the proper final approach path, it is advisable to dis­ continue the approach, go around, and start the turn  earlier on the next approach rather than risk a hazard­ ous situation.

Figure 11-1. Base leg and final approach.  

# Final Approach  

After the base-to-final approach turn is completed,  the powered parachute should be aligned with the  centerline of the runway or landing surface, so drift  (if any) will be recognized immediately. On a normal  approach, with no wind drift, keep the longitudinal  axis aligned with the runway centerline throughout  the approach and landing. (The proper way to correct  for a crosswind will be explained under the section,  “Crosswind Approach and Landing.” For now, only  an approach and landing where the wind is straight  down the landing area will be discussed.)  

Focus directly down the centerline and steer right or  left to remain on that centerline.  

While aligning the powered parachute down the run­ way centerline, or straight down your intended landing  area, slight adjustments in power may be necessary to  maintain the descent.  

Control the descent angle throughout the approach so  the powered parachute will land in the center of the  first third of the runway. The descent angle is affected  by the throttle. More throttle means lower descent  rate, less throttle results in a higher descent rate. The  wind also plays a prominent part in the gliding dis­ tance over the ground. [Figure 11-2] Naturally, you  do not have control over the wind but may correct for  its effect on the powered parachute’s descent by ap­ propriate power adjustments: more throttle is required  in a headwind and crosswind, less throttle is required  with a tailwind.  

The objective of a good final approach is to descend  at an angle that will permit the powered parachute to  reach the desired touchdown point. Since on a nor­ mal approach the power setting is not fixed as in a  power-off approach, adjust the power as necessary,  to control the descent angle, or to attain the desired  altitudes along the approach path. This is one reason  for performing approaches with partial power; if the  approach is too high, merely reduce the power. When  the approach is too low, add power.  

![](images/5b09340cff8d9a73c709fc68a10b3f4c49ccfe1839e195b6e8c7c53946f83c64.jpg)  
Figure 11-2. Effect of headwind on final approach.  

# Estimating Height and Movement  

During the approach, roundout, and touchdown, vi­ sion is of prime importance. To provide a wide scope  of vision and to foster good judgment of height  and movement, your head should assume a natural,  straight-ahead position. Your visual focus should not  be fixed on any one side or any one spot ahead of the  powered parachute, but should be changing slowly  from a point just over the powered parachute’s nose­ wheel to the desired touchdown zone and back again,  while maintaining a deliberate awareness of distance  from either side of the runway within your periph­ eral field of vision. Accurate estimation of distance  is, besides being a matter of practice, dependent upon  how clearly objects are seen; it requires that vision be  focused properly for the important objects to stand out  as clearly as possible.  

Speed blurs objects at close range. For example, con­ sider the view from an automobile moving at high  speed. Nearby objects seem to merge together in a  blur, while objects farther away stand out clearly. The  driver subconsciously focuses the eyes sufficiently far  ahead of the automobile to see objects distinctly. In  the same way, the distance at which the powered para­ chute pilot’s vision is focused is normally adjusted  automatically.  

If you attempt to focus on a reference that is too close  or look directly down, the reference will become  blurred, and the reaction will be either too abrupt or  too late. In this case, your tendency will be to over- control, round out high, and make drop-in landings.  When you focus too far ahead, accuracy in judging  the closeness of the ground is lost and the consequent  reaction will be too slow since there will not appear  to be a necessity for action. This will result in flying  into the ground without flaring.  

# Roundout  

The powered roundout is a slow, smooth transition  from a normal approach descent rate to a landing de­ scent rate, gradually rounding out the flightpath to  one that is parallel with, and within a very few inches  above the runway. When the powered parachute is in  a normal descent, within what appears to be 10 to 20  feet above the ground, the powered roundout should  be started. Once started, it should be a continuous pro­ cess until the powered parachute touches down on the  ground.  

As the powered parachute reaches a height above  the ground where a timely change can be made into  the proper landing descent, power should be gradu­ ally applied to slowly decrease the rate of descent.  [Figure 11-3]  

The rate at which the roundout is executed depends  on the powered parachute’s height above the ground  and the rate of descent. A roundout started excessively  high must be executed more slowly than one from a  lower height to allow the powered parachute to de­ scend to the ground. The rate of rounding out must  also be proportionate to the rate of closure with the  

![](images/8c6d991620ced93c287a3ecb95c5c6bfc58783909e3d5e499b5bcc86f48e4e06.jpg)

ground. When the powered parachute appears to be  descending very slowly, no increase in power settings  is called for.  

Visual cues are important in rounding out at the prop­ er altitude and maintaining the wheels a few inches  above the surface until eventual touchdown. Visual  cues are primarily dependent on the angle at which  your central vision intersects the ground (or runway)  ahead and slightly to the side. Proper depth perception  is a factor in a successful flare, but the visual cues used  most are those related to changes in runway or ter­ rain perspective and to changes in the size of familiar  objects near the landing area such as fences, bushes,  trees, hangars, and even sod or runway texture. You  should direct central vision at a shallow downward  angle of from   $10^{\circ}$   to   $15^{\circ}$   toward the runway as the  roundout is initiated.  

Maintaining the same viewing angle causes the point  of visual interception with the runway to move pro­ gressively rearward toward you as the powered para­ chute loses altitude. This is an important visual cue  in assessing the rate of altitude loss. Conversely, for­ ward movement of the visual interception point will  indicate an increase in altitude, and would mean that  power was increased too rapidly, resulting in floating.  In most powered parachutes, the front wheel can eas­ ily be seen and can be used as an indicator of how far  the main wheels are above the runway.  

which would result in a hard, drop-in type landing.  You should keep one hand on the throttle throughout  the approach and landing, in case a sudden and un­ expected hazardous situation requires an immediate  application of power.  

# Wing Control  

The measured input of the flare is directly related to  the leg extension of the pilot. For one-third flare, si­ multaneously push the steering controls out approxi­ mately one-third of your leg length. During a full-flare,  you would be fully extending your legs to apply input  to the steering controls; one-half flare, you would be  pushing the controls out half of your full leg exten­ sion, and so on. [Figure 11-4]  

For landings, the amount of flare needed is directly  related to the descent rate. The steeper and faster the  descent, the more flare input is required for a smooth  landing. [Figure 11-5] Keep in mind the flare is con­ verting forward momentum into lift. So, if the pilot is  landing with a very slow descent rate, then the pilot  would only need to apply one-third flare during the  landing. Use full-flare during an engine-out descent,  which is the steepest descent of a PPC, for landing.  

A flare should be applied in a single 1-2-3 motion.  Apply the flare smoothly, in a rhythmic, even, “1-2-  $_{3}{\mathrm{"}}$   motion.  

In some cases, it may be necessary to advance the  throttle slightly to prevent an excessive rate of sink

Figure 11-5. The steeper the descent rate, the greater the need for flare.  

# Touchdown  

The touchdown is the gentle settling of the powered  parachute onto the landing surface. The roundout and  touchdown should be made with the engine slightly  below level flight power levels. As the powered para­ chute settles, the parachute is flared to smooth out the  landing.  

Some pilots may try to force or fly the powered para­ chute onto the ground without flaring. It is paradoxi­ cal that the way to make an ideal landing is to try to  hold the powered parachute’s wheels a few inches off  the ground as long as possible. In most cases, when  the wheels are within a foot or less off the ground, the  powered parachute will still be settling too fast for a  gentle touchdown; therefore, this rate of descent must  be retarded by the use of flare. [Figure 11-6]  

Flare is accomplished by pushing both steering bar  tubes simultaneously. That pulls the entire trailing  edge of the parachute down. That increases drag, low­ ers the forward speed, and most importantly (for land­ ing) increases the lift of the parachute. The amount  of flare needed depends on the rate of descent right  before landing. If the rate of descent is very gradual,  very little flare is needed. Conversely, in an engine- out situation a lot of flare is required. Accurately  determining how much flare is needed for a given  situation is developed with practice. A general rule is  to begin the flare one second before you would other­ wise touch the ground.  

Flare is used rather than engine power because the  wing is much more responsive in controlling descent  and pitch than engine power. When you add flare, the  drag on the wing increases and the wing quickly re­ sponds by rotating backwards and increasing its pitch  angle. In order to achieve the same effect with engine  power, you add throttle, the propeller speeds up, and  the thrust pushes the cart (which is much heavier than  a parachute) forward of the wing. It is easier to change  the inertia and positioning of a 25-pound wing than a   $500+$   pound cart-engine-pilot-fuel assembly.

Figure 11-6. A well executed roundout results in attaining the proper landing attitude.  

It is extremely important the touchdown occur with  the powered parachute’s longitudinal axis exactly  parallel to the direction in which the PPC is moving  along the surface. Failure to accomplish this imposes  side loads on the landing gear. To avoid these side  stresses, you should try to not allow the PPC to touch  down while drifting.  

# After-Landing Roll  

The landing process must never be considered com­ plete until the powered parachute has been brought to  a complete stop, the engine shut down, and the wing  collapsed and on the ground. Many accidents have oc­ curred as a result of pilots abandoning their vigilance  and positive control after getting the powered para­ chute on the ground. Some have damaged their para­ chute by failing to stop the engine before the wing  falls into the moving propeller. Other incidents have  occurred where the wind has caught a still-inflated  wing and rolled the powered parachute over.  

Normally as soon as you have landed, you should do  four things in this order:  

1.	Release any flare that was used during landing.  Once the flare is released, the wing will rotate  forward relative to the cart. That decreases both  the angle of attack and lift that the landing flare  generated. With the flare released, there will be  more load put on the front landing gear, which  in turn makes the powered parachute easier to  ground handle.  

2.	Unless you have the intention to taxi the powered  parachute with the parachute inflated, close the  throttle.

 	 3.	Shut down the ignition system. Normally,  powered parachutes have two toggle ignition  switches. Both toggle switches must be turned  off to shut down the engine.

 	 4.	The parachute needs to be collapsed and  grounded. This is done by tugging on the  parachute steering lines. One long pull will  generally not be adequate. Three or four quick  tugs will normally be enough. The wing rotating  and collapsing behind the cart will also act as  a brake for the powered parachute, much like a  drogue chute. [Figure 11-7]  

Landings should always be planned to be done di­ rectly into the wind. However, if you must land in a  crosswind, you may be able to land but you will not  be able to takeoff. You can land on higher crosswinds  than you can take off.  

A wide runway may allow you the capability to land  across the runway. However, a narrow runway would  not allow this. Therefore, if you must land in a cross­ wind, during final approach, crab into the wind and  line up on the runway centerline. Approach with this  crab and flare as you normally would. Reduce power  as your back wheels touch. When your back wheels  touch, your front wheel will swing around, straight  down the runway. However your wing will still be  headed into the wind. Shut the engine down and con­ tinue pulling the steering lines to get the canopy down  on the ground immediately since you can not taxi in  a crosswind.

# Stabilized Approach Concept  

A stabilized approach is one in which the pilot es­ tablishes and maintains a constant angle glidepath to­ wards a predetermined point on the landing runway.  It is based on the pilot’s judgment of certain visual  clues, and depends on the maintenance of a constant  final approach.  

A powered parachute descending on final approach at  a constant rate will be traveling in a straight line to­ ward a spot on the ground ahead. This spot will not be  the spot on which the powered parachute will touch  down, because some float will inevitably occur during  the powered roundout and flare.  

The point toward which the powered parachute is pro­ gressing is termed the “aiming point.” [Figure 11-8]  It is the point on the ground at which, if the powered  parachute maintains a constant glidepath, and was not  rounded out or flared for landing, it would strike the  ground. To a pilot moving straight ahead toward an  object, it appears to be stationary. It does not “move.”  This is how the aiming point can be distinguished— it  does not move.  However, objects in front of and be­ yond the aiming point do appear to move as the dis­ tance is closed, and they appear to move in opposite  

![](images/3ca556ff4c41dc4e8f0d30f2383eae6cad5e962f66f85654c32779772911b59a.jpg)

directions. During instruction in landings, one of the  most important skills a student pilot must acquire is  how to use visual cues to accurately determine the true  aiming point from any distance out on final approach.  From this, the pilot will not only be able to determine  if the glidepath will result in an undershoot or over­ shoot, but, taking into account float during roundout,  the pilot will be able to predict the touchdown point  to within a very few feet.  

For a constant angle glidepath, the distance between  the horizon and the aiming point will remain constant.  If a final approach descent has been established but  the distance between the perceived aiming point and  the horizon appears to increase (aiming point mov­ ing down away from the horizon), then the true aim­ ing point, and subsequent touchdown point, is farther  down the runway. If the distance between the per­ ceived aiming point and the horizon decreases (aim­ ing point moving up toward the horizon), the true  aiming point is closer than perceived.  

When the powered parachute is established on final  approach, the shape of the runway image also pres­ ents clues as to what must be done to maintain a sta­ bilized approach to a safe landing.  

The objective of a stabilized approach is to select  an appropriate touchdown point on the runway, and  adjust the glidepath so the true aiming point and the  desired touchdown point basically coincide. Immedi­ ately after rolling out on final approach, you should  adjust the power so the powered parachute is de­ scending directly toward the aiming point. With the  approach set up in this manner, you will be free to  devote full attention toward outside references. You  should not stare at any one place, but rather scan from  one point to another, such as from the aiming point  to the horizon, to the trees and bushes along the run­ way, to an area well short of the runway, and back to  the aiming point. In this way, you will be more apt to  perceive a deviation from the desired glidepath, and  whether or not the powered parachute is proceeding  directly toward the aiming point.  

If the aiming point on the runway is not where you  want it, adjust the glidepath. This in turn will move  the aiming point. For instance, if you perceive the  aiming point is short of the desired touchdown point  and will result in an undershoot, increase the engine  power. The power change must be made smoothly.  This will result in a shallower glidepath with the  resultant aiming point moving towards the desired  touchdown point. Conversely, if the aiming point is  farther down the runway than the desired touchdown  point and you suspect it will result in an overshoot,  steepen the glidepath by decreasing power.  

The closer the powered parachute gets to the runway,  the larger (and possibly more frequent) the required  corrections may become, resulting in an unstabilized  approach.  

Common errors in the performance of normal ap­ proaches and landings are:  

•	 Inadequate wind drift correction on the base  leg. •	 Overshooting or undershooting the turn onto  final approach resulting in too steep or too  shallow a turn onto final approach. •	 Unstabilized approach. •	 Focusing too close to the powered parachute  resulting in a too high roundout. •	 Focusing too far from the powered parachute  resulting in a too low roundout. •	 Flaring the parachute too early before  touchdown. •	 Touching down prior to attaining proper landing  attitude. •	 Failure to release the flare after touchdown.  

# Go-Arounds (Rejected Landings)  

Whenever landing conditions are not satisfactory, a  go-around is warranted. There are many factors that  can contribute to unsatisfactory landing conditions.  Situations such as air traffic control requirements, un­ expected appearance of hazards on the runway, over­ taking another powered parachute, wind shear, wake  turbulence, mechanical failure and/or an unstabilized  approach are all examples of reasons to discontinue  a landing approach and make another approach un­ der more favorable conditions. The assumption that  an aborted landing is invariably the consequence of  a poor approach, which in turn is due to insufficient  experience or skill, is a fallacy. The go-around is not  strictly an emergency procedure. It is a normal ma­ neuver that may at times be used for normal situa­ tions. It does not need to be an emergency to do a  go-around. Like any other normal maneuver, the go- around must be practiced and perfected. The flight  instructor should emphasize early on, and the student  pilot should understand, that the go-around maneuver  is an alternative to any approach and/or landing.  

Although the need to discontinue a landing may arise  at any point in the landing process, the most critical  go-around will be one started when very close to the  ground. Therefore, the earlier a condition that warrants  a go-around is recognized, the safer the go-around/
 rejected landing will be. The go-around maneuver is not  inherently dangerous in itself. It becomes dangerous  only when delayed unduly or executed improperly.  

Delay in initiating the go-around normally stems from  two sources: (1) landing expectancy, or set—the an­ ticipatory belief that conditions are not as threatening  as they are and that the approach will surely be termi­ nated with a safe landing, and (2) pride—the mistaken  belief that the act of going around is an admission of  failure—failure to execute the approach properly. The  improper execution of the go-around maneuver stems  from a lack of familiarity with the three cardinal prin­ ciples of the procedure:  power ,  power , and  power .  

Power is your first concern. The instant you decide to  go around,  full  power must be applied smoothly and  without hesitation, and held until the powered para­ chute climbs back to pattern altitude. Applying only  partial power in a go-around is never appropriate. You  must be aware of the degree of inertia that must be  overcome, before a powered parachute that is settling  towards the ground can become capable of turning  safely or climbing. The application of power should  be smooth as well as positive. Abrupt movements of  the throttle in some powered parachutes will cause the  engine to falter.  

Common errors in the performance of go-arounds (re­ jected landings) are:  

•	 Failure to recognize a condition that warrants a  rejected landing. •	 Indecision. •	 Delay in initiating a go-around. •	 Failure to apply maximum allowable power in a  timely manner. •	 Abrupt power application. •	 Failure to adequately compensate for torque/
 P-factor.  

# Turbulent Air Approach and Landing  

Powered parachute flying is a low-wind sport. It is im­ portant PPC pilots evaluate the upper-air winds to en­ sure the wind is within the limitations for that aircraft,  accounting for wind shear and wind gust possibilities  at pattern altitude.  

For flying in more turbulent air on final approach,  maintain power throughout the approach to reduce  your descent rate in case you do experience a down  gust. This will alleviate the possibility of an excessive  descent rate.  

# Emergency Approaches and  Landings (Simulated)  

From time to time on dual flights, the instructor should  give simulated emergency landings by retarding the  throttle and calling “simulated emergency landing.”  

The objective of these simulated emergency landings  is to develop the pilot’s accuracy, judgment, planning,  procedures, and confidence when little or no power is  available.  

A simulated emergency landing may be given at any  time. When the instructor calls “simulated emergency  landing,” the pilot should consider the many variables,  such as altitude, obstruction, wind direction, landing  direction, landing surface and gradient, and landing  distance requirements. Risk management must be ex­ ercised to determine the best outcome for the given  set of circumstances. The higher the altitude, the more  time the pilot has to make the decision of where to  land.  

Using any combination of normal gliding maneuvers,  from wing level to turns, the pilot should eventually  arrive at the normal key position at a normal traffic  pattern altitude for the selected landing area. From  this point on, the approach will be as nearly as pos­ sible a normal power-off approach. [Figure 11-9]  

All pilots should learn to determine the wind direction  and estimate its speed. This can be done by observing  the windsock at the airport, smoke from factories or  houses, dust, brush fires, and windmills.  

Once a field has been selected, the student pilot should  always be required to indicate it to the instructor. Nor­ mally, the student should be required to plan and fly  a pattern for landing on the field elected until the in­ structor terminates the simulated emergency landing.  This will give the instructor an opportunity to explain  and correct any errors; it will also give the student an  opportunity to see the results of the errors.  

However, if the student realizes during the approach  that a poor field has been selected—one that would  obviously result in disaster if a landing were to be  made—and there is a more advantageous field within  gliding distance, a change to the better field should  be permitted. The hazards involved in these last-min­ ute decisions, such as excessive maneuvering at very  low altitudes, should be thoroughly explained by the  instructor.  

![](images/6e3c9a6a1502faabd45e7a80d1b4d8ddb75e1f8bfea648434387962fabc23929.jpg)  
Figure 11-9. Remain over intended landing area; once selected, never have the landing zone behind the pilot/aircraft.  

During all simulated emergency landings, the engine  should be kept warm and cleared. During a simulated  emergency landing, either the instructor or the student  should have complete control of the throttle. There  should be no doubt as to who has control since many  near accidents have occurred from such misunder­ standings.  

Every simulated emergency landing approach should  be terminated as soon as it can be determined whether  a safe landing could have been made. In no circum­ stances should you violate the altitude restrictions  detailed in 14 CFR part 91 or any local nonaviation  regulations in force. It is also important to be courte­ ous to anyone on the ground. In no case should it be  continued to a point where it creates a hazard or an  annoyance to persons or property on the ground.  

In addition to flying the powered parachute from the  point of simulated engine failure to where a reason­ able safe landing could be made, the pilot should also  learn certain emergency cockpit procedures. The habit  of performing these cockpit procedures should be de­ veloped to such an extent that, when an engine failure  actually occurs, the pilot will check the critical items  that would be necessary to get the engine operating  again after selecting a field and planning an approach.  Accomplishing emergency procedures and executing  the approach may be difficult for the pilot during the  early training in emergency landings.  

There are definite steps and procedures to follow in a  simulated emergency landing. They should be learned  thoroughly by the student, and each step called out  to the instructor. The use of a checklist is strongly  recommended. Most powered parachute manufac­ turers provide a checklist of the appropriate items.  [Figure 11-10]  

Critical items to be checked should include the quan­ tity of fuel in the tank and the position of the ignition  switches. Many actual emergency landings could have  been prevented if the pilots had developed the habit of  checking these critical items during flight training to  the extent that it carried over into later flying.  

Instruction in emergency procedures should not be  limited to simulated emergency landings caused by  power failures. Other emergencies associated with  the operation of the powered parachute should be ex­

plained, demonstrated, and practiced if practicable.  Among these emergencies are such occurrences as fire  in flight, electrical system malfunctions, unexpected  severe weather conditions, engine overheating, immi­ nent fuel exhaustion, and the emergency operation of  powered parachute systems and equipment.  

# Faulty Approaches and Landings  

# Low Final Approach  

When the base leg is too low, insufficient power is  used or the velocity of the wind is misjudged, suf­ ficient altitude may be lost, which will cause the  powered parachute to be well below the proper final  approach path. In such a situation, you would have  to apply considerable power to fly the powered para­ chute (at an excessively low altitude) up to the run­ way threshold.  

When it is realized the runway will not be reached  unless appropriate action is taken, power must be  applied immediately to stop the descent. When the  proper approach path has been intercepted, the cor­ rect approach attitude should be re-established and  the power reduced and a stabilized approach main­ tained. [Figure 11-11] If there is any doubt about the  approach being safely completed, it is advisable to  EXECUTE AN IMMEDIATE GO-AROUND.  

# High Final Approach  

When the final approach is too high, reduce power as  required. [Figure 11-12] When the proper approach  path has been intercepted, adjust the power as re­ quired to maintain a stabilized approach. When steep­ ening the approach path, however, care must be taken  that the descent does not result in an excessively high  sink rate. If a high sink rate is continued close to the  surface, it may be difficult to slow to a proper rate  prior to ground contact. Any sink rate in excess of   $800\!-\!1,\!000$   feet per minute is considered excessive. A  go-around should be initiated if the sink rate becomes  excessive.  

# Use of Power  

Power can be used effectively during the approach  and roundout to compensate for errors in judgment.  Power can be added to slow the descent rate to an ac­ ceptable rate. Some pilots use power rather than wing  flare to land smoothly. After the powered parachute  has touched down, it will be necessary to close the  throttle so the additional thrust and lift will be re­ moved and the powered parachute will stay on the  ground.  

# High Roundout  

It is possible to flare for landing too high above the  ground. [Figure 11-13] If this happens, efforts need to  be made to prevent the wing from surging forward. The  power should not be reduced and the flare should only  be reduced slightly or the wing could surge forward  as the pendulum starts swinging back. Some pilots try  to correct this situation by reducing the throttle too  much and letting off the flare completely in order to  land closer to their chosen landing point. This invari­ ably results in the cart rotating back under the forward  surging wing and diving towards the ground because  lift has been dramatically reduced. Any surging for­ ward of the wing above the cart should be slowed by  increased flare. If the flare is performed too high off  the ground, a go-around can be accomplished.  

It is recommended that a go-around be executed any  time it appears that there may not be enough runway  to safely land the powered parachute or if the landing  is in any other way uncertain.  

# Bouncing During Touchdown  

When the powered parachute contacts the ground  with a sharp impact as the result of an excessive sink  rate, the cart tends to bounce back into the air.  

The corrective action for a bounce when it is very  slight is to make a follow-up landing by applying suf­ ficient power to cushion the subsequent touchdown  and by adding flare as needed.  

When a bounce is severe, the safest procedure is to  EXECUTE A GO-AROUND IMMEDIATELY. No  attempt to salvage the landing should be made. Ap­

ply full power and check the wing is LOC (lines free,  cells open, wing centered) since a hard landing can  collapse a ram-air wing. It would be extremely fool­ ish to attempt a landing from a bad bounce since the  skill set that would allow a student to make a severe  bounce would not be up to the task of salvaging a bad  landing.  

# Hard Landing  

When the powered parachute contacts the ground dur­ ing landings, its vertical speed is instantly reduced to  zero. Unless provisions are made to slow this vertical  speed and cushion the impact of touchdown, the force  of contact with the ground may be so great it could  cause structural damage to the powered parachute.  Reductions in rapid descent rates are made through  throttle increases. Closer to the ground, additional  flare is applied before touchdown.  

The purpose of pneumatic tires, shock absorbing land­ ing gears, and other devices is to cushion the impact  and to increase the time in which the powered para­ chute’s vertical descent is stopped. Within a fraction  of a second, the powered parachute must be slowed  from a high rate of vertical descent to zero, without  damage.  

During this time, the landing gear together with  some aid from the lift of the ram-air wing must sup­ ply whatever force is needed to counteract the force  of the powered parachute’s inertia and weight. The  lift decreases rapidly as the powered parachute’s for­ ward speed is decreased, and the force on the landing  gear increases by the impact of touchdown. When the  descent stops, the lift will be zero, leaving the land­ ing gear alone to carry both the powered parachute’s  weight and inertia force. Any time you have a hard  landing, inspect your landing gear, tires, and structure  to make sure there is no structural damage.  

# Wing Blowing Over After Touchdown  

When landing in a crosswind, there is a concern that  the wing will blow downwind during the after-land­ ing roll. This is due to the fact that the wing is flexibly  attached to the cart.  

Anytime a powered parachute is rolling on the ground  in a crosswind condition, the upwind side of the para­ chute is receiving a force that wants to push it down­ wind.  

If no correction is applied, it is possible that the upwind  side of the parachute will rise sufficiently to cause the  downwind side of the parachute to strike the ground.  If the wind and/or the forward motion of the powered  parachute is great enough, a rollover may result. It is  important for a pilot to remember that the parachute  should be flown or pulled to the ground right after  landing the cart. The cart and the parachute’s move­ ments should be controlled together on the ground.  

# Night Operations and the 
 Powered Parachute  

Flying a powered parachute after sunset requires a  private pilot powered parachute certificate. In addi­ tion, the powered parachute needs to be equipped for  night operations by adding position lights for taxi and  flight. Position lights are green on the right, red on  the left, and white in the back. Anti-collision strobe  lights can also be used in addition to position lights.  [Figure 12-1]  

![](images/c5b220e1de821c3628cc1695b91a9c4c60d9dfb598b9782229d25eba43228661.jpg)  
Figure 12-1. Powered parachutes must be specifically  equipped for night flight.  

The use of lighted runways for night flight imposes  several problems for the powered parachute pilot.  Setting up on a runway and conducting a preflight on  a powered parachute cart and wing in the dark could  tie up a designated runway area for a considerable  amount of time, not to mention raise issues about be­ ing able to see the aircraft and wing components for  proper preflight inspection.  

A pilot planning to fly a powered parachute at night  should ensure adequate illumination is provided for  takeoff. The wing needs to be illuminated to ensure  the wing cells are all open, the wing is centered, and  the lines are not tangled (LOC). The takeoff area needs  adequate illumination to ensure hazards are avoided.  Typically, lights on poles can present a hazard at an  airfield.  

A powered parachute flight where the preflight in­ spection was completed during daylight, just prior to  sunset, and then the final landing made after sunset  may be a more feasible endeavor. If a powered para­ chute pilot holding a private pilot certificate or higher  were to venture into night flight, Chapter 15 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  should  be carefully reviewed to understand the parameters  that need to be considered prior to conducting a flight  in the dark.  

# Emergency Situations  

This section contains information on dealing with un­ expected situations that may occur in flight. The key  to successful management of an emergency situation,  and/or preventing a problem from progressing into a  true emergency, is a thorough familiarity with, and ad­ herence to, the procedures developed by the powered  parachute (PPC) manufacturer. Hence, the following  guidelines are generic and are not meant to replace  the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. Rather,  they are meant to enhance your general knowledge  in the area of emergency operations. If any of the  guidance in this chapter conflicts in any way with the  manufacturer’s recommended procedures, the manu­ facturer’s recommended procedures take precedence.  

Review the lost procedures and flight diversion tech­ niques in Chapter 14 of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aero­ nautical Knowledge.  You must be able to select an  appropriate alternate airport or landing area and route,  determine there is sufficient fuel to fly to the alternate  airport or landing area, turn to and establish a course  to the select alternate destination, and maintain the  appropriate altitude and heading while doing so. As  a PPC pilot you must be able to select an appropriate  course of action if you become lost, including main­ taining an appropriate heading and climb if necessary,  identify prominent landmarks, and use your naviga­ tion system (GPS) or contact an ATC facility for as­ sistance, as appropriate.  

Review the POH for the aircraft you fly to be familiar  with the necessary pilot actions required for system  and equipment malfunctions. You must be prepared  to analyze the situation and take action if you experi­ ence any of the following system and equipment mal­ functions: engine/oil and fuel, electrical, carburetor or  induction icing, smoke and/or fire, flight control/trim,  pitot static/vacuum and associated flight instruments,  propeller, ballistic recovery system malfunction (if  applicable), or any other emergency unique to the  powered parachute you are flying.  

# Accidents  

It is estimated that 85 percent of accidents occur dur­ ing the takeoff process, 10 percent transpire during  landings, and 5 percent happen in flight. The vast  majority of these accidents are the direct result of  complacency. The cause of this complacency is that  the PPC is relatively easy to fly. Hence, if you find  complacency setting in, you need to turn from outside  distractions, and direct your attention to the immedi­ ate situational awareness of the aircraft.  

The following are some reasons for PPC complacency  during flight:  

•	 The PPC does not require quick reactions. •	 When compared to other light-sport aircraft  (LSA), the PPC flies very slowly. •	 The PPC has only two axes around which you  can directly control (lateral-pitch and vertical- yaw). Note: As there are no ailerons on a PPC,  roll or movement around the longitudinal axis  cannot be directly controlled. However, there  is longitudinal roll invoked during a steep turn  as the centrifugal force of the cart directs the  cart to the outside of the suspension point of the  wing. •	 The controls are very intuitive (push right to go  right, left to go left, more throttle to go up, and  less to go down).  

It is possible the outside environment can become a  distraction to the necessary situational awareness of  flying (i.e., situational complacency). Hence, in-flight  accidents can be due to the pilot’s failure to see ob­ structions (power lines and tower cables) and to an­ ticipate weather-related turbulence and its resultant  negative effects on a PPC’s light wing (i.e., wind  rotors or mechanical turbulence). Landing accidents  are usually the result of porpoising (too rapid throttle  movements), thermals, or unsafe field terrain. Takeoff  problems can be caused by: (1) failure to get a wing  LOC before adding airborne power; and (2) failure to  take off into the wind.  

# Potential Hazards of the 
 Standing PPC  

Even while parked on the ground, high winds can pick  up the wing of an unsecured powered parachute and  begin carrying it away. To regain control of a free- standing PPC with a semi-inflated, dragging wing,  rescuers need to grasp the steering lines—not the  cart! Then with a steering line in hand, pull the line  back toward the front of the cart (into the wind) and  tie it off to any structured part of the PPC. This will  keep the wing from gathering air and re-inflating. If  you are by yourself, you do not have to do both lines  simultaneously. It would be best to get both lines, but  with a PPC that is dragging down the field, grab any  steering line and get at least one line secured; then  secure the second line. When you pull a steering line,  the canopy will be pulled down on that side and the  air in the wing will literally be pulled out, as the wing  is hauled back and down.  

The best safety procedure is prevention. To safeguard  a PPC from high winds, immediately after landing,  secure the wing. Even if you only intend to refuel, it is  highly recommended to condense the exposure of the  wing to the elements: the harmful ultraviolet rays of  the sun and those unexpected wind gusts. As soon as  possible after landing, condense the wing by folding it  on top of itself and put something on top of it to secure  it. It is best to pack the canopy to keep it out of the sun  and make sure the wind cannot inflate the wing and  if possible, lean the nose wheel up, then place the fan  guard of the cart back and down on the folded wing.  Securing it this way will usually be adequate for short  breaks when the make and model allows for this static  positioning. [Figure 12-2]

# Restricted Lines During the 
 Takeoff Roll  

If the lines (steering or suspension lines) become re­ stricted, such as around part of an outrigger, a trim  lock, or an accessory—then while safely maintaining  your ground direction into the wind and holding your  RPM down to kiting speed—reach out and push the  line off of the restricting object. If this is not possible,  then shut the PPC down and abort the takeoff.  

To abort a takeoff (i.e., to shutdown) maintain your  ground steering clear of obstacles as you: (1) power  down the throttle, (2) push the magneto switches into  the OFF position, and (3) pull the wing down.  

# Entangled or Embedded Lines  

If the lines become entangled or embedded with de­ bris, then shut the PPC down and clean up the lines.  If you don’t, and you load the wing by beginning the  lift-off, the stress on the lines as they pull through  the debris (twigs, sticks, and so forth) can break the  lines.  

# Lines Caught Under a Wheel  

If the lines go under a wheel, IMMEDIATELY abort  the takeoff. Shut down: power, magnetos and wing  down.  

# A Wing Wall  

The term “wall” is simply defined as the canopy liter­ ally forming a wall-like appearance behind the PPC.  [Figure 12-3] The trailing edge of the canopy is still  on the ground, while the leading edge of the canopy  forms the top of the wall. The “wall” is the first can­ opy problem that might occur during the initial kiting  of the wing.  

![](images/ba21a94f48e20f962dc37e9e83c4b966b6a6e15844f57e853e7edee749e4d0f0.jpg)  
Figure 12-3. A wing wall.  

Even though some pilots will try to “pop” the canopy  out of the “wall,” the only safe solution is to immedi­ ately abort the takeoff, and re-layout the canopy. By  shutting down and restarting the takeoff preflight, pi­ lots will save the expense of many line and propeller  repairs. Lines will inevitably become damaged when  a pilot tries to “pop” the canopy out of the wall via  sharp throttle movements. When you fight the wall,  you create an ideal situation for lines to get sucked  into the propeller.  

# A Wing Lock-Out  

A wing “lock-out” occurs when the initial forward  momentum is insufficient to move the canopy through  the prop-wash and up and above the PPC cart. [Figure  12-4] During this phenomenon, the inflated canopy  will hang at about a   $45^{\circ}$   angle behind the cart. This  is a “parachutal-wing stall” while the pilot is still on  the ground. Usually, regardless of how much ground­ speed is increased, the wing will stay in a parachutal- wing stall behind the cart as long as the tension on the  suspension lines remains the same; the wing will stay  “locked-out” in that   $45^{\circ}$   position.  

![](images/a4bf977b72e7cd90d52d9c642a3f64c5c602124f887055cf281c2051bc3894f8.jpg)  

# Figure 12-4. A wing lock-out.  

There are two techniques that can be used to correct  this “parachutal-wing stall” position of a rectangular  wing:  

1.	Lower the groundspeed until the canopy begins  to fall down and back behind the cart. Then  before the wing touches the ground, smoothly  and firmly increase the groundspeed to move  (“sling-shot”) the canopy up and above the cart.

 	 2.	Maintain the groundspeed and pull the canopy  back via a flare (i.e., pushing both foot steering  bars). Hold the flare until the drag caused on the  tail of the wing pulls the wing back down—about  a  $60^{\circ}$   angle­—and then smoothly release the flare.  The release of the flare will again “sling-shot”  the canopy up and above the cart.  

![](images/a297229ec8d597e2656dce71137a2943890d234b81451cb8393e57061b4ed865.jpg)  
Figure 12-5. The wing should be centered and forward to the rise attachment points prior to takeoff.  

Note: Ask the advice of an instructor before using  these techniques on an elliptical-shaped wing. The  characteristics between the two types of PPC wings  are significant in correcting the “Locked-Out” scenario.  

# Wing Not Centered Overhead  

No takeoff should ever be attempted until the wing  is centered above the cart and forward to the riser at­ tachment points. [Figure 12-5]  

Hence, if the wing is not centered when it comes  ahead to the riser attachment of the cart:  

1.	Keep steering into the wind, and

 	 2.	Keep your groundspeed below airborne (liftoff)  speed.  

The most noteworthy aspect of the takeoff preflight  roll is to verify that the wing is positioned correctly.  Due to the design, the wing will normally want to  be up and centered above the cart. It also wants to  weathervane into the wind. If you don’t rush the take­ off roll, and give the wing the time and speed it needs  to adjust and settle overhead, the takeoff will be fine.  The wing wants to be centered over the cart and point­ ing into the wind. You must steer into the wind during  the entire takeoff roll.  

You can adjust the wing’s position during your take­ off preflight roll once the wing is up and past the  $45^{\circ}$  position. When the wing is down on one side, apply  steering input to the opposite side. Hence, if the wing  is hanging down on the left side of the cart, push on  the right steering bar. The additional drag created on  the right side will begin to pull the wing up to a more  centered position (from being down on the left).  

To compensate for the inertia of the wing’s movement  as it is traveling upward, reduce the initial steering bar  pressure, just before (not when) the wing is centered  overhead. Then slowly add slight opposite steering  bar pressure to compensate for possible over-correc­ tion (inertia) of the wing from center.  

Remember: you do NOT need to manually move the  wing center. The design of the wing and its attachment  points create the tendency for the wing to be centered  and overhead. You need only to steer the wing into the  wind, allow the time needed to self correct, and pro­ vide the proper groundspeed to achieve proper wing  position prior to takeoff.  

# The Cart Turns Over (Roll-Over)  

During a PPC taxi, you have two entities to steer: the  wing and the cart. Until united in an airborne pendu­ lum, the independent wing can follow one path, while  the “grounded” cart may insist on another. This can  result in a pull-over. [Figure 12-6] Normally this situ­ ation occurs when pilots are not headed into the wind  during takeoff, or try a crosswind taxi beyond the PPC  limitations or their current skill level.  

The strongest inclination of a taxiing ram-air wing  is to weathervane. The wing wants to point into the  wind. However, if the pilot is steering the cart in a  

![](images/e96ca3354e5a7b19e4903072c76d98571dd8eaa0c2120ed270f1cb264114d2d8.jpg)  
Figure 12-6. A wing pull-over.  

different direction and has failed to notice the differ­ ence and has not corrected the wing over the center of  the cart, then the wing can pull the cart over. The cart  will be pulled over when the wing has been given the  required airspeed to create the necessary lift to over­ come the weight of the cart.  

Since a taxiing cart has all its wheels on the ground,  friction exists between the ground and the wheels.  The friction causes the cart to travel in a particular di­ rection. If the wing is in the air and pulling the cart in  a different direction, opposing forces may be working  against each other. You must prevent the wing from  gaining enough force (horizontal lift) to pull the cart  over on its side. Hence, caution must be used during  taxi turns. Therefore, if the wing is not centered, and  all the wing’s cells are not open, or the suspension or  steering lines are not clear of debris and free of frame  obstructions, DO NOT increase the throttle to provide  the wing enough airspeed to generate lift. Either shut  down or slow down while pointing the cart into the  wind and then correctly build the wing.  

On a takeoff or landing, when you get hit with an un­ expected side gust of wind, or try to take off before  the wing is centered, the cart may be placed into a  condition where it could be pulled over on its side by  the horizontal lift of the wing. During a pull-over, you  will react to one of two possible situations:  

1.	Your cart is lifting on one side, but you still have  time to recover.

 	 2.	Your cart is up on one wheel; past the point of  recovery and beginning to tip over.  

In the first situation, to enhance the recovery, imme­ diately remove the lifting force from the wing by re­ ducing the groundspeed (i.e., reduce engine RPM via  the throttle).  

In the second and most uncomfortable situation of not  being able to prevent the pull-over:  

1.	Immediately place the magneto switches OFF, to  turn OFF the engine and stop the propeller.

 	 2.	Do not try to prevent the pull-over with your  body (i.e., sticking out your arms and legs). Pull  your arms and legs up into a tuck position to  protect your limbs. When the aircraft comes to a  stop, immediately unstrap and get out of the cart.

 	 3.	In the event the situation does not conflict with  the provisions of Title 49, Code of Federal  Regulations, Volume 5, Chapter VIII, Part 830  (49 CFR 830), move the unit back into an upright  position (to prevent gas and oil from spilling  out).  

Keep in mind the above paragraph does NOT imply  a wing pull-over should ever be a normal or periodi­ cal occurrence. These accidents can cause death or  serious injuries and damage to your aircraft. With the  proper training and understanding, a wing pull-over is  easily prevented during the takeoff roll if you:  

1.	Keep the cart headed into the wind.

 	 2.	Stay calm, relaxed and don’t rush your takeoff  roll.

 	 3.	Realize it is the airspeed that is giving the wing  lift, so slow down if you feel side lift and one  rear wheel rising in a tipping fashion.

 	 4.	Let the cart settle back on all wheels as you  maintain your heading into the wind.

 	 5.	Let the wing settle overhead, and allow all the  cells to fully inflate.

 	 6.	Re-check the lines to make sure they are free and  unrestricted.

 	 7.	Verify you do not have a “pig-tail” in the rear of  the wing fabric or a friction knot in the lines.

 	 8.	Get your wing repositioned for takeoff, or abort  the takeoff and get situated.  

# Engine Failure on Climbout  

Urgency characterizes all power loss or engine fail­ ure occurrences after lift-off. In most instances, the  pilot has only a few seconds after an engine failure to  decide the course of action and execute it. Unless pre­ pared in advance to make the proper decision, there is  a chance the pilot will make a poor decision, or make  no decision at all and allow events to rule.  

The altitude available is, in many ways, the control­ ling factor in the successful accomplishment of an  emergency landing. If an actual engine failure should  occur immediately after takeoff and before a safe ma­ neuvering altitude is attained, it is usually not advis­ able to attempt to turn back to the field from where the  takeoff was made. Instead, it is safer to immediately  establish the proper glide attitude, and select a land­ ing area directly ahead or slightly to either side of the  takeoff path. Complete the landing in accordance with  the next section.  

In the event of an engine failure on initial climb-out,  the powered parachute is typically at a high pitch  angle with the cart well in front of the wing. When  the engine fails, the cart swings back under the wing  and the wing can surge forward bringing the PPC  into a temporary and potentially dangerous dive. If  the engine-out occurs close to the ground, and the  wing starts to surge out in front of the cart, it is neces­ sary to immediately flare the wing to slow the surge.  Gradually release the flare when the forward surge is  controlled and the wing is back overhead in a normal  flying position.  

# Engine Failure In Flight  

Never fly over something you cannot land on (con­ sidering your altitude and glide slope) and remain  constantly aware of the surrounding terrain and hence  potential landing zones. If you adhere to these rules,  an in-flight engine failure will not directly correlate  to an accident or incident. If this happens, continue  to fly the aircraft. You simply glide it away from all  obstacles and toward the safest landing area.  

The safest landing zone may perhaps be in the middle  of the flight park if you have a lot of altitude. Or, the  best landing zone may be straight ahead if you are  below 100 feet. If at all possible, set up your landing  approach so you touch down into the wind—but the  number one priority of an engine-out scenario is safe  terrain (not ground wind direction). Wind direction is  a secondary concern. Land into the wind if possible;  otherwise land downwind. Crosswind is the least fa­ vorable wind direction to land into.  

When you are about one second from touchdown, be­ gin applying a full flare. [Figure 12-7] With a single  1-2-3 rhythmic timing motion, push both foot steer­ ing bars completely forward and hold that position as  the rear wheels touch the ground. You can increase  the amount of flare before landing, but you cannot  release it when you are close to the ground and with­ out power! Once on the ground smoothly release the  flare and pull down the canopy (since the engine is  already off).

Figure 12-7. Engine-out, beginning full-flare about one  second above the ground.  

# Engine Failure in a PPCL  

When planning any over-water flight, wear a life vest.  Maintain an altitude that will allow you to safely glide  to land should the engine fail. [Figure 12-8] If you  consistently fly over water, consider attaching an au­ tomatic, inflatable device or pontoons to the bottom of  your PPC (i.e., so it becomes a PPCS with pontoons,  as opposed to a PPCL in water). Carry a line-cutter  that is easy to access, yet placed so as not to cause  additional injury upon impact. Practice emergency  procedures so you are prepared and brief your pas­ sengers on evacuation procedures prior to any over- water flight.  

![](images/787ea0a6b7e40217881fd2ebcbaf572200b0a29e925f77637297b676efbfcea0.jpg)  
Figure 12-8. You should not fly over water beyond your  glide slope to the shore.  

If you find yourself over water with an engine failure,  too far to glide to shore, remain strapped in so the cart  can provide some impact protection. It is possible you  will become disorientated, as the PPCL will likely flip  over when you hit the water and settle upside-down in  the water. You may become entangled in the wing and  lines as it descends upon the craft and the occupants.  

Although your PPCL may float for a few minutes, it  will eventually sink. The time before sinking will de­ pend on the amount of fuel left, the condition of the  seals on the ends of your tubing, and the air left in  your tires after impact.  

As soon as you know a water landing is inevitable,  your first step is to align your PPCL into the wind if  possible, and move as close to shore as possible.  

1.	Don’t panic. Use the ADM “DECIDE” method.

 	 2.	Stay seated.

 	 3.	Turn off all electronics.

 	 4.	Remove any objects that will delay your  evacuation of the aircraft prior to impact (i.e.,  communication cords, camera straps, etc.).

 	 5.	Discard any objects that may penetrate your skin  upon impact (or hit you, such as cameras).

 	 6.	Tighten your seatbelt and shoulder harnesses.

 	 7.	At approximately 2 seconds (  ${\sim}25$   feet) above the  water, bring your head, neck, and legs in as close  to your body as possible. Place your arms along  the side of your head, with your hands over the  lower back of your head.

 	 8.	If experienced, you could execute a full flare and  a parachutal-wing stall approximately 3 seconds  (  $\sim\!\!\bar{40}$   feet) above the water (recommended for  PPCs with foot steering bars only).

 	 9.	Once in the water, release your seatbelt and  shoulder harness and exit the cart.

 10.	Help your passenger with his or her restraints.

 11.	Do not try to retrieve items on the aircraft or  try to save the aircraft. When surfacing, avoid  the wing and swim to the side of the PPC (if  entangled with the canopy lines, cut them with  the line cutter and work your way to the edge of  the wing).

 12.	Swim to shore.  

# In-Flight Fire  

Considering the flammability of a ram-air wing, it is  easy to realize that in-flight fire—especially an engine  or fuel fire—is one of the most serious emergencies  a PPC pilot can encounter. (Note: An electrical fire  in the front of the cart is unlikely to cause anything  more than an engine failure. Therefore, see “Engine  Failures” above for this specific emergency.) If there  is any sign of fire near the engine, fuel containers, or  fuel lines, do everything possible to reduce the pos­ sibilities of the fire spreading and land as soon as pos­ sible. The necessary procedures are:  

•	 Reduce throttle to idle; •	 If possible, shut off fuel valves; •	 Shut off magnetos; •	 Shut off all electronics; •	 Land immediately and stop as quickly as  possible; and •	 Evacuate the aircraft immediately.  

After landing, get far away. The principal danger after  evacuating the PPC is that the fuel will ignite and ex­ plode, with the potential to injure people at consider­ able distances.  

# Landing Porpoise  

Porpoising refers to pitch oscillations, most notice­ able during a landing. These erratic pilot-induced  movements are a result of rapid throttle movements.  This is a common, correctable error pilots need to be  aware of. There is a delay between throttle changes  and pitch changes. Porpoising will result if you over- control the throttle during a landing attempt, causing  pitch oscillations. As a result of over-reacting, the  PPC, which is now dangerously close to the ground,  

![](images/7eaefbde7e62ba6a18f7a629798eac9179af58e72c0b712e4c6bf42535bc73f9.jpg)  

will be further induced into increasing the forward/ rearward swinging oscillations from the pilot throttle  movements. [Figure 12-9]  

If this happens, immediately abort the landing and  climb back to pattern altitude. On the next turn to  final, relax and work with a slow, smooth throttle  action.  

# Gust-Induced Oscillations  

Gusty headwinds can induce pitch oscillations as the  lightweight wing responds faster and more easily  to the wind gust than the cart. Crosswinds can also  induce side-to-side swing oscillations. A crosswind  from the right, for instance, tends to weathervane the  PPC wing into the wind, causing an unexpected yaw  to the right. Right crosswind gust also tends to lift  the upwind side of the wing. When crosswinds are  gusty, these effects vary rapidly as the speed of the  crosswind varies.  

Local terrain can have a considerable effect on the  wind. Wind blowing over and around obstacles can be  gusty and chaotic. Nearby obstacles, such as buildings,  trees, cliffs, and mountains can have a pronounced ef­ fect on low altitude winds, particularly on the down­ wind side of the obstruction. In general, the effect of  an upwind obstacle is the creation of additional tur­ bulence. These conditions are usually found from the  surface to a height 10 times above the obstacle. Flight  in these conditions should be avoided.  

Pilot-induced side-to-side swinging can occur as the  pilot continues to over-control the steering controls.  This usually occurs with new pilots during the land­ ing phase, and typically begins after a side gust of  wind during the approach. The solution is similar: re­ lax your steering control pressures; realize the PPC  wants to be centered (side to side, as well as fore and  aft). Ease the pressure on the steering controls, and let  your inputs balance the PPC pendulum movements.  [Figure 12-10]  

# Cross-Country Flights  

Preparation is essential to handling an emergency  while on a cross-country flight. Carry your wing bag  and line sleeve whenever possible. If you have these  items with you during a flight, should you confront  unexpected bad weather, you need not consider going  around it or fighting it. Simply find a suitable landing  site—preferably next to a road. Avoid private prop­ erty and landing in crops. Pack up your wing and se­ cure the canopy bag to the cart any time you are on  

![](images/bda5f6e3e023fc2656c29395765b178a860833ad97486c1e06452b30d2815e97.jpg)  
Figure 12-10. Side-to-side swinging on landing approach.  

the ground. You then have the option to wait until the  weather passes or walk to a phone or shelter.  

# Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear  

It is a good idea (especially at a fly-in) to circle a new  flight park before departing, making a note of the lo­ cal landmarks, so you can find your field (via pilot­ age) on your return. Be sure to file, open, and close a  flight plan with Flight Service (FSS).  

Carry a flight safety kit:  

•	 Flashlight. •	 Reflection mirror. •	 Water and food (enough for 2 days). •	 Matches. •	 A utility tool: combo pliers, knife, and so forth.  •	 Your canopy bag and line sleeve whenever  possible­—just in case you are forced to drive  the cart back to civilization. Note: You should  drive the cart to the nearest phone—BUT NO  FARTHER. •	 Tire repair can which includes a sealer and air  pressure. •	 Tape to repair small canopy tears.­ The  manufacturer’s POH typically has specifications  for repairs but as guideline, a tear less than   $2"$   can be repaired with common duct tape.  However, cut lines will ground you and hence  force you to drive the cart back or walk home.  

Communication can be your radio, cell phone, vi­ sual, or audible signals. Signal mirrors, flashlight or  light beacons at night, signal fire flames at night, sig­ nal smoke during daylight hours, signal flares, and a  prominent wing display are effective methods.  

Search and rescue squads (SAR) are particularly  tuned to signals of threes. Hence, three fires arranged  in a triangle, three bangs against a log, or three flashes  of a mirror—all of these will initiate a rapid response  by search and rescue.  

The aviation transceiver can be tuned to broadcast and  receive on the emergency frequency   $121.5~\mathrm{MHz}$   or  any other usable frequency that will elicit a response.  

The wing can be employed to lay out a prominent  marker to aid recognition from the air by other air­ craft. The wing can also be used as an effective  layered garment when wrapped around the body to  conserve body heat or to provide relief from excessive  sunlight.

 instructor. SUSPENSION LINES—Lines that run from several  attachment points on the wing down to a set of  cables called risers, which connect to the PPC cart. TAILWIND—Wind blowing in the same direction  the aircraft is moving. When an aircraft is flying  with a tailwind, its speed over the ground is equal  to its speed through the air, plus the speed the air  is moving over the ground. TAKEOFF CLEARANCE—ATC authorization for  an aircraft to depart a runway. It is predicated on  known traffic and known physical airport condi­ tions. TAXI—The movement of an aircraft under its own  power while on the ground. TAXIWAY—Airport area designated for aircraft  surface movement. TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTION (TFR)— Designated airspace of specified dimension where  flight is temporarily restricted or prohibited.  NOTAMs are issued to advise airmen of local TFR  restrictions. TERMINAL RADAR SERVICE AREAS (TRSA)— Areas where participating pilots can receive addi­ tional radar services. The purpose of the service is  to provide separation between all IFR operations  and participating VFR aircraft. TFR—See TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRIC­TION.  

THERMAL—A buoyant plume or bubble of rising  air. THROTTLE—The control in an aircraft that regu­ lates the power or thrust the pilot wants the engine  to develop. THRUST—The force which imparts a change in the  velocity of a mass. A forward force which propels  the powered parachute through the air. TORQUE—(1) A resistance to turning or twisting.  (2) Forces that produce a twisting or rotating mo­ tion. (3) In a PPC, the tendency of the aircraft to  turn (roll) in the opposite direction of rotation of  the engine and propeller. TOTAL DRAG—The sum of the parasite and in­ duced drag. TOUCH AND GO—An operation by an aircraft that  lands and takes off without stopping. TOUCHDOWN POINT—The point or intended  point at which an aircraft first makes contact with  the landing surface. TOUCHDOWN ZONE—The portion of a runway, beyond the threshold, where it is intended landing  aircraft first contact the runway. TRACK—The actual path made over the ground in  flight. TRAFFIC PATTERN—The traffic flow that is pre­ scribed for aircraft landing at or taking off from an  airport. TRAFFIC PATTERN INDICATORS—Ground based visual indicators that identify traffic pattern  direction at certain airports. TRAILING EDGE—The portion of the airfoil where  the airflow over the upper surface rejoins the lower  surface airflow. TRANSPONDER—The airborne portion of the sec­ ondary surveillance radar system. The transponder  emits a reply when queried by a radar facility. TRICYCLE GEAR CONFIGURATION—Land­ ing gear configuration employing a third wheel  located on the nose of the aircraft. TRSA—See TERMINAL RADAR SERVICE 
 AREAS. TWO-STROKE ENGINE—A simple form of  reciprocating engine that completes its operating  cycle in two strokes of its piston—one down and  one up. Two-stroke-cycle engines are inefficient  in their use of fuel, but their simplicity makes  them popular for powering light-sport aircraft and  ultralight vehicles where light weight and low cost  are paramount.  

ULTRALIGHT—A vehicle as defined by 14 CFR  103.1. UNSTABILIZED APPROACH—The final approach  of an aircraft that has not achieved a stable rate of  descent or controlled flight track by a pre-deter­ mined altitude, usually 500 feet AGL. UPWIND LEG—A flight path parallel to the landing  runway in the direction of landing.  VEHICLE—Man-made means of transportation; an  ultralight aircraft (not a light-sport aircraft). VENTURI—A specially shaped restriction in a tube  designed to speed up the flow of fluid passing  through in accordance with Bernoulli’s principle.  Venturis are used in carburetors and in many types  of fluid control devices to produce a pressure  drop proportional to the speed of the fluid passing  through them. VENTURI EFFECT—The effect of Bernoulli’s  principle, which states that the pressure of a fluid  decreases as it is speeded up without losing or  gaining any energy from the outside. VERIFIED—Confirmation of information or con­ figuration status. VERTICAL AXIS (YAW)—An imaginary line pass­ ing vertically through the center of gravity of an  aircraft. The vertical axis is called the z-axis or the  yaw axis. VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR (VSI)—An in­ strument that uses static pressure to display a rate  of climb or descent in feet per minute. The VSI  can also sometimes be called a vertical velocity  indicator (VVI). VERTIGO—A type of spatial disorientation caused  by the physical senses sending conflicting signals  to the brain. Vertigo is especially hazardous when  flying under conditions of poor visibility and may  cause pilot incapacitation, but may be minimized  by confidence in the indication of the flight instru­ ments. VFR—See VISUAL FLIGHT RULES. VFR TERMINAL AREA CHARTS—Charts desig­ nated to depict Class B airspace in greater detail  and greater scale than sectional charts. VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)—Code of Federal  Regulations that govern the procedures for con­ ducting flight under visual conditions. V LINES—See RISERS. VSI—See VERTICAL SPEED INDICATOR. WAKE TURBULENCE—Wingtip vortices that are  created when an aircraft generates lift. When an  aircraft generates lift, air spills over the wingtips  from the high pressure areas below the wings  

to the low pressure areas above them. This flow  causes rapidly rotating whirlpools of air called  wingtip vortices or wake turbulence. WASHOUT—A condition in aircraft rigging in  which a wing is twisted so its angle of incidence is  less at the tip than at the root. Washout decreases  the lift the wing produces to improve the stall  characteristics of the wing. WEATHER BRIEFING—Means for pilots to gather  all information vital to the nature of the flight.  Most often obtained from FSS specialist. WEATHERVANE—The tendency to point into the  wind. WEIGHT—A measure of the heaviness of an object.  The force by which a body is attracted toward the  center of the Earth (or another celestial body) by  gravity. Weight is equal to the mass of the body  times the local value of gravitational acceleration.  One of the four main forces acting on an aircraft.  Equivalent to the actual weight of the aircraft. It  acts downward through the aircraft’s center of  gravity toward the center of the Earth. Weight op­ poses lift. WEIGHT-SHIFT CONTROL AIRCRAFT—Pow­ered aircraft with a framed pivoting wing and a  fuselage controllable only in pitch and roll by the  pilot’s ability to change the aircraft’s center of  gravity with respect to the wing. Flight control of  the aircraft depends on the wing’s ability to flex­ ibly deform rather than the use of control surfaces. WIND CORRECTION ANGLE—Correction ap­ plied to the course to establish a heading so that  track will coincide with course. WIND DIRECTION INDICATORS—Indicators that include a wind sock, wind tee, or tetrahedron.  Visual reference will determine wind direction and  runway in use. WIND DRIFT CORRECTION—Correction applied  to the heading of the aircraft necessary to keep the  aircraft tracking over a desired track. WIND SHEAR—A sudden, drastic shift in wind­ speed, direction, or both that may occur in the  horizontal or vertical plane. WING—A ram-air inflated and pressurized fabric  airfoil that produces the lift necessary to support  the powered parachute in flight; including the lines  that attach to the cart. Also called a parachute,  chute, or airfoil. WING LOADING—The amount of weight that a  wing must support to provide lift. WINGSPAN—The maximum distance from wingtip  to wingtip.
