# Preface  

The Helicopter Flying Handbook is designed as a technical manual for applicants who are preparing for their private,  commercial, or flight instructor pilot certificates with a helicopter class rating. Certificated flight instructors may find  this handbook a valuable training aid, since detailed coverage of aerodynamics, flight controls, systems, performance,  flight maneuvers, emergencies, and aeronautical decision-making is included. Topics such as weather, navigation, radio  navigation and communications, use of flight information publications, and regulations are available in other Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) publications.  

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certification concepts established by the FAA. There are different ways of  teaching, as well as performing, flight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations in the explanations of aerodynamic  theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept to flying helicopters. The discussion and  explanations reflect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally the word “must” or similar language  is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve  a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR). Persons working towards a helicopter rating are  advised to review the references from the applicable practical test standards (FAA-S-8081-3 for recreational applicants,  FAA-S-8081-15 for private applicants, and FAA-S-8081-16 for commercial applicants). Resources for study include  FAA-H-8083-25, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, and FAA-H-8083-1, Weight and Balance Handbook, as  these documents contain basic material not duplicated herein. All beginning applicants should refer to FAA-H-8083-25,  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, for study and basic library reference.  

It is essential for persons using this handbook to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   and the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). The AIM is available online at www.faa.gov. The current Flight Standards  Service airman training and testing material and learning statements for all airman certificates and ratings can be obtained  from www.faa.gov.  

This handbook supersedes FAA-H-8083-21A, Helicopter Flying Handbook, dated 2012. Gyroplane information can be  found in the FAA-H-8083-20, Gyroplane Flying Handbook.

# Chapter 1 Introduction to the Helicopter  

# Introduction  

A helicopter is an aircraft that is lifted and propelled by one  or more horizontal rotors, each rotor consisting of two or  more rotor blades. Helicopters are classified as rotorcraft  or rotary-wing aircraft to distinguish them from fixed-wing  aircraft, because the helicopter derives its source of lift from  the rotor blades rotating around a mast. The word “helicopter”  is adapted from the French hélicoptère, coined by Gustave de  Ponton d’Amécourt in 1861. It is linked to the Greek words  helix/helikos (“spiral” or “turning”) and pteron (“wing”).  

As an aircraft, the primary advantages of the helicopter are  due to the rotor blades that revolve through the air, providing  lift without requiring the aircraft to move forward. This lift  allows the helicopter to hover in one area and to take off  and land vertically without the need for runways. For this  reason, helicopters are often used in congested or isolated  areas where fixed-wing aircraft are not able to take off or  land.   [Figures 1-1  and  1-2]  

Piloting a helicopter requires adequate, focused and safety- orientated training. It also requires continuous attention  to the machine and the operating environment. The pilot  must work in three dimensions and use both arms and  both legs constantly to keep the helicopter in a desired  state. Coordination, timing and control touch are all used  simultaneously when flying a helicopter.  

Although helicopters were developed and built during the  first half-century of flight, some even reaching limited  production; it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by  Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production, with 131 aircraft  built. Even though most previous designs used more than one  main rotor, it was the single main rotor with an antitorque  tail rotor configuration that would come to be recognized  worldwide as the helicopter.

# Turbine Age  

In 1951, at the urging of his contacts at the Department of  the Navy, Charles H. Kaman modified his K-225 helicopter  with a new kind of engine, the turbo-shaft engine. This  adaptation of the turbine engine provided a large amount of  horsepower to the helicopter with a lower weight penalty  than piston engines, heavy engine blocks, and auxiliary  components. On December 11, 1951, the K-225 became  the first turbine-powered helicopter in the world. Two years  later, on March 26, 1954, a modified Navy HTK‑1, another  Kaman helicopter, became the first twin-turbine helicopter  to fly. However, it was the Sud Aviation Alouette II that  would become the first helicopter to be produced with a  turbine engine.  

Reliable helicopters capable of stable hover flight were  developed decades after fixed-wing aircraft. This is largely  due to higher engine power density requirements than  fixed-wing aircraft. Improvements in fuels and engines  during the first half of the  $20^{\mathrm{th}}$   century were critical factors  in helicopter development. The availability of lightweight  turbo-shaft engines in the second half of the  $20^{\mathrm{th}}$   century led  to the development of larger, faster, and higher-performance  helicopters. While smaller and less expensive helicopters  still use piston engines, turboshaft engines are the preferred  powerplant for helicopters today.  

The turbine engine has the following advantages over a  reciprocating engine:  

•	 Less vibration •	 Increased aircraft performance •	 Reliability •	 Ease of operation  

# Uses  

Due to the unique operating characteristics of the helicopter— its ability to take off and land vertically, to hover for extended  periods of time, and the aircraft’s handling properties under  low airspeed conditions—it has been chosen to conduct tasks  that were previously not possible with other aircraft or were  too time- or work-intensive to accomplish on the ground.  Today, helicopters are used for transportation, construction,  firefighting, search and rescue, and a variety of other jobs  that require its special capabilities.  [Figure 1-3]

Figure 1-3.  The many uses for a helicopter include search and rescue  (top), firefighting (middle), and construction (bottom).  

# Rotor System  

The helicopter rotor system is the rotating part of a  helicopter that generates lift. A rotor system may be mounted  horizontally, as main rotors are, providing lift vertically; and  it may be mounted vertically, such as a tail rotor, to provide  lift horizontally as thrust to counteract torque effect. In the  case of tilt rotors, the rotor is mounted on a nacelle that  rotates at the edge of the wing to transition the rotor from a  horizontal mounted position, providing lift horizontally as  thrust, to a vertical mounted position providing lift exactly  as a helicopter.  

The rotor consists of a mast, hub, and rotor blades.  [Figure 1-4]   The mast is a hollow cylindrical metal shaft which extends  upwards from and is driven by the transmission. At the top  of the mast is the attachment point for the rotor blades called  the hub. The rotor blades are then attached to the hub by  several different methods. Main rotor systems are classified  according to how the main rotor blades are attached and  move relative to the main rotor hub. There are three basic  classifications: semirigid, rigid, or fully articulated, although  some modern rotor systems use an engineered combination  of these types. All three rotor systems are discussed with  greater detail in Chapter 4, Helicopter Components, Sections,  and Systems.  

With a single main rotor helicopter, a torque effect is created  as the engine turns the rotor. This torque causes the body of  the helicopter to turn in the opposite direction of the rotor  (Newton’s Third Law: Every action has an equal and opposite  reaction, as explained in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics of Flight).  To eliminate this effect, some sort of antitorque control must  be used with a sufficient margin of power available to allow  the helicopter to maintain its heading and prevent the aircraft  from moving unsteadily. The three most common controls  used today are the traditional tail rotor, Fenestron (also called  a fantail), and the NOTAR ® . All three antitorque designs will  be discussed in Chapter 4, Helicopter Components, Sections,  and Systems.

Figure 1-4.  Basic components of the rotor system.  

# Rotor Configurations  

Most helicopters have a single, main rotor but require a  separate rotor to overcome torque which is a turning or  twisting force. This is accomplished through a variable  pitch, antitorque rotor or tail rotor. This is the design that  Igor Sikorsky settled on for his VS-300 helicopter shown  in  Figure 1-5.  It has become the recognized convention for  helicopter design, although designs do vary. Helicopter main  rotor designs from different manufacturers rotate in one of  two different directions (clockwise or counter-clockwise  when viewed from above). This can make it confusing when  discussing aerodynamic effects on the main rotor between  different designs, since the effects may manifest on opposite  sides of each aircraft. For clarity, throughout this handbook,  all examples use a counter-clockwise rotating main rotor  system when viewed from above.

# Tandem Rotor  

Tandem rotor (sometimes referred to as dual rotor) helicopters  have two large horizontal rotor assemblies, instead of one  main assembly and a smaller tail rotor.  [Figure 1-6]  Single  rotor helicopters need a tail rotor to neutralize the twisting  momentum produced by the single large rotor. Tandem  rotor helicopters, however, use counter-rotating rotors, each  canceling out the other’s torque. Counter-rotating rotor  blades will not collide with and destroy each other if they  flex into the other rotor’s pathway. This configuration has  the advantage of being able to hold more weight with shorter  blades, since there are two blade sets. Also, all the power  from the engines can be used for lift, whereas a single rotor  helicopter must use some power to counter main rotor torque.  Because of this, tandem helicopters make up some of the  most powerful and fastest rotor system aircraft.

# Coaxial Rotors  

Coaxial rotors are a pair of rotors turning in opposite  directions, but mounted on a mast, with the same axis of  rotation, one above the other. This configuration is a noted  feature of helicopters produced by the Russian Kamov  helicopter design bureau.  [Figure 1-7]  

# Intermeshing Rotors  

Intermeshing rotors on a helicopter are a set of two rotors  turning in opposite directions, with each rotor mast mounted  on the helicopter with a slight angle to the other so that  the blades intermesh without colliding.  [Figure 1-8]  This  arrangement allows the helicopter to function without the  need for a tail rotor. It has high stability and powerful lifting  capability. This configuration is sometimes referred to as a  synchropter. The arrangement was developed in Germany

# Tail Rotor  

The tail rotor is a smaller rotor mounted vertically or near- vertically on the tail of a traditional single-rotor helicopter.  The tail rotor either pushes or pulls against the tail to counter  the torque. The tail rotor drive system consists of a drive shaft  

![](images/586cf38762ed039a6293de6296373cbc9c40a8cb1dfec135dac618dd05a906f0.jpg)  
Figure 1-9.  Basic tail rotor components.  

powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted  at the end of the tail boom.  [Figure 1-9]  The drive shaft may  consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected  at both ends with flexible couplings. The flexible couplings  allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom.  

The gearbox at the end of the tail boom provides an angled  drive for the tail rotor and may also include gearing to adjust  the output to the optimum rotational speed typically measured  in revolutions per minute (rpm) for the tail rotor. On some  larger helicopters, intermediate gearboxes are used to angle  the tail rotor drive shaft from along the tail boom or tailcone  to the top of the tail rotor pylon, which also serves as a vertical  stabilizing airfoil to alleviate the power requirement for the  tail rotor in forward flight. The pylon (or vertical fin) may  also provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges  if the tail rotor or the tail rotor flight controls fail.  

# Controlling Flight  

A helicopter has four primary flight controls:  

•	 Cyclic •	 Collective •	 Antitorque pedals •	 Throttle  

# Cyclic  

The cyclic control is usually located between the pilot’s legs  and is commonly called the “cyclic stick” or simply “cyclic.”  On most helicopters, the cyclic is similar to a joystick;  however, Robinson helicopters have unique T-bar cyclic  control systems. A few helicopters have cyclic controls that  descend into the cockpit from overhead while others use side  cyclic controls.  

The control is called the cyclic because it can vary the pitch  of the rotor blades throughout each revolution of the main  rotor system (i.e., through each cycle of rotation) to develop  unequal lift (thrust). The result is to tilt the rotor disk in a  particular direction, resulting in the helicopter moving in that  direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic forward, the rotor disk  tilts forward, and the rotor produces a thrust in the forward  direction. If the pilot pushes the cyclic to the side, the rotor  disk tilts to that side and produces thrust in that direction,  causing the helicopter to hover sideways.  [Figure 1-10]  

# Collective  

The collective pitch control, or collective, is located on the  left side of the pilot’s seat with a pilot-selected variable  friction control to prevent inadvertent movement. The  collective changes the pitch angle of all the main rotor blades  

![](images/844fd728853a4a75009ea8e3344a539c4709428396e10507cb475083287bc3e9.jpg)  
Figure 1-10.  Cyclic controls changing the pitch of the rotor blades.  

collectively (i.e., all at the same time) and independently of  their positions. Therefore, if a collective input is made, all  the blades change equally, increasing or decreasing total  lift or thrust, with the result of the helicopter increasing or  decreasing in altitude or airspeed.  

# Antitorque Pedals  

The antitorque pedals are located in the same position as the  rudder pedals in a fixed-wing aircraft and serve a similar  purpose, namely to control the direction in which the nose  of the aircraft is pointed. Application of the pedal in a given  direction changes the pitch of the tail rotor blades, increasing  or reducing the thrust produced by the tail rotor, causing the  nose to yaw in the direction of the applied pedal. The pedals  mechanically change the pitch of the tail rotor, altering the  amount of thrust produced.  

# Throttle  

![](images/1f621d60acdb54e99900f1d0c37ccd1c53b2baf8a26b1cc796b58a538f22fd87.jpg)  
Figure 1-11.  The throttle control mounted at the end of the collective  control.  

The throttle controls the power produced by the engine, which  is connected to the rotor by a transmission. The purpose of  the throttle is to maintain enough engine power to keep the  rotor rpm within allowable limits to produce enough lift for  flight. In single-engine helicopters, if so equipped, the throttle  control is typically a twist grip mounted on the collective  control, but it can also be a lever mechanism in fully  governed systems. Multi-engine helicopters generally have  a power lever or mode switch for each engine.  [Figure 1-11]   Helicopter flight controls are discussed in greater detail  throughout Chapter 4, Helicopter Components, Sections  and Systems.  

# Flight Conditions  

There are two basic flight conditions for a helicopter: hover  and forward flight. Hovering is the most challenging part of  flying a helicopter. This is because a helicopter generates  its own gusty air while in a hover, which acts against the  fuselage and flight control surfaces. The end result is the  need for constant control inputs and corrections by the pilot  to keep the helicopter where it is required to be. Despite  the complexity of the task, the control inputs in a hover are  simple. The cyclic is used to eliminate drift in the horizontal  direction that is to control forward and back, right and left.  The collective is used to maintain altitude. The pedals are  used to control nose direction or heading. It is the interaction  of these controls that makes hovering so difficult, since an  adjustment in any one control requires an adjustment of the  other two, creating a cycle of constant correction.  

Displacing the cyclic forward initially causes the nose to  pitch down, with a resultant increase in airspeed and loss  of altitude. Aft cyclic initially causes the nose to pitch up,  slowing the helicopter and causing it to climb; however, as  the helicopter reaches a state of equilibrium, the horizontal  stabilizer helps level the helicopter to minimize drag, unlike  

![](images/70190c599a44d6638782d343c4e7f7d4bc74b803e920821031f4f43e370ea160.jpg)  
Figure 1-12.  The horizontal stabilizer helps level the helicopter to  minimize drag during flight.  

an airplane.  [Figure 1-12]  Therefore, the helicopter has  very little pitch deflection up or down when the helicopter  is stable in a flight mode. The variation from absolutely  level depends on the particular helicopter and the horizontal  stabilizer function.  

Increasing collective (power) while maintaining a constant  airspeed induces a climb while decreasing collective causes  a descent. Coordinating these two inputs, down collective  plus aft cyclic or up collective plus forward cyclic, results  in airspeed changes while maintaining a constant altitude.  

The pedals serve the same function in both a helicopter  and a fixed-wing aircraft, to maintain balanced flight. This  is done by applying pedal input in whichever direction is  necessary to center the ball in the turn and bank indicator.  Flight maneuvers are discussed in greater detail throughout  Chapter 9, Basic Flight Maneuvers.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter gives the reader an overview of the history  of the helicopter, its many uses, and how it has developed  throughout the years. The chapter also introduces basic terms  and explanations of the helicopter components, sections, and  the theory behind how the helicopter flies.  

# Chapter 2 Aerodynamics of Flight  

# Introduction  

This chapter presents aerodynamic fundamentals and  principles as they apply to helicopters. The content relates  to flight operations and performance of normal flight tasks.  It covers theory and application of aerodynamics for the  pilot, whether in flight training or general flight operations.  

Gravity acting on the mass (the amount of matter) of an object  creates a force called weight. The rotor blade below weighs  100 lbs. It is 20 feet long (span) and is 1 foot wide (chord).  Accordingly, its surface area is 20 square feet.  [Figure 2-1]  

The blade is perfectly balanced on a pinpoint stand, as you  can see in  Figure 2-2  from looking at it from the end (the  airfoil view). The goal is for the blade to defy gravity and  stay exactly where it is when we remove the stand. If we do  nothing before removing the stand, the blade will simply fall  to the ground. Can we exert a force (a push or pull) opposite  gravity that equals the 100 lb. weight of the blade? Yes, for  example, electromagnetic force could be used. In helicopters,  however, we use aerodynamic force to oppose weight and  to maneuver.  

Every object in the atmosphere is surrounded by a gas that  exerts a static force of 2,116 lb per square foot (a force  times a unit area, called pressure) at sea level. However, that  pressure is exerted equally all over the blade (top and bottom)  and therefore does not create any useful force on the blade.  We need only create a difference of a single pound of static  pressure differential per square foot of blade surface to have a  force equal to the blade’s weight (100 lb of upward pressure  opposite 100 lb downward weight).  

Total pressure consists of static pressure and, if the air is  moving, dynamic pressure (a pressure in the direction of the  air movement). As shown in  Figure 2-3 , if dynamic pressure  

![](images/d6e64fe76569787cd949d165b6cac9b1de0b60850a38ee42cde01b540224cd44.jpg)

is increased the static pressure will decrease. Due to the  design of the airfoil, the velocity of the air passing over the  upper surface will be greater than that of the lower surface,  leading to higher dynamic pressure on the upper surface than  on the lower surface. The higher dynamic pressure on the  upper surface lowers the static pressure on the upper surface.  The static pressure on the bottom will now be greater than  the static pressure on the top. The blade will experience an  upward force. With just the right amount of air passing over  the blade the upward force will equal one pound per square  foot. This upward force is equal to, and acts opposite the  blade’s weight of 100 lb. So, if we now remove the stand, the  blade will defy gravity and remain in its position (ignoring  rearward drag for the moment).  

The force created by air moving over an object (or moving  an object through the air) is called aerodynamic force. Aero  means air. Dynamic means moving or motion. Accordingly,  by moving the air over an airfoil we can change the static  pressures on the top and bottom thereby generating a useful  force (an aerodynamic force). The portion of the aerodynamic  force that is usually measured perpendicular to the air flowing  around the airfoil is called lift and is used to oppose weight.  Drag is the portion of aerodynamic force that is measured  as the resistance created by an object passing through the air  (or having the air passed over it). Drag acts in a streamwise  direction with the wind passing over the airfoil and retards  forward movement.  

# Forces Acting on the Aircraft  

Once a helicopter leaves the ground, it is acted upon by  four aerodynamic forces; thrust, drag, lift, and weight.  Understanding how these forces work and knowing how to  control them with the use of power and flight controls are  essential to flight.  [Figure 2-3]  They are defined as follows:  

![](images/f65b7cb8df386989ac5baa975fc889465f7c88cca8c1573edc52cf3e6c739db7.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.  Four forces acting on a helicopter in forward flight.  

•	 Lift—opposes the downward force of weight, is  produced by the dynamic effect of the air acting on the  airfoil and acts perpendicular to the flightpath through  the center of lift.  

•	 Weight—the combined load of the aircraft itself, the  crew, the fuel, and the cargo or baggage. Weight pulls  the aircraft downward because of the force of gravity.  It opposes lift and acts vertically downward through  the aircraft’s center of gravity (CG). •	 Thrust—the force produced by the power plant/ propeller or rotor. It opposes or overcomes the force  of drag. As a general rule, it acts parallel to the  longitudinal axis. However, this is not always the case,  as explained later. •	 Drag—a rearward, retarding force caused by  disruption of airflow by the wing, rotor, fuselage, and  other protruding objects. Drag opposes thrust and acts  rearward parallel to the relative wind.  

For a more in-depth explanation of general aerodynamics,  refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge.  

# Lift  

Lift is generated when an object changes the direction of  flow of a fluid or when the fluid is forced to move by the  object passing through it. When the object and fluid move  relative to each other and the object turns the fluid flow in  a direction perpendicular to that flow, the force required to  do this work creates an equal and opposite force that is lift.  The object may be moving through a stationary fluid, or the  fluid may be flowing past a stationary object—these two are  effectively identical as, in principle, it is only the frame of  reference of the viewer which differs. The lift generated by  an airfoil depends on such factors as:  

•	 Speed of the airflow •	 Density of the air •	 Total area of the segment or airfoil •	 Angle of attack (AOA) between the air and the airfoil  

The AOA is the angle at which the airfoil meets the oncoming  airflow (or vice versa). In the case of a helicopter, the object  is the rotor blade (airfoil) and the fluid is the air. Lift is  produced when a mass of air is deflected, and it always acts  perpendicular to the resultant relative wind. A symmetric  airfoil must have a positive AOA to generate positive lift. At  a zero AOA, no lift is generated. At a negative AOA, negative  lift is generated. A cambered or nonsymmetrical airfoil may  produce positive lift at zero, or even small negative AOA.  

The basic concept of lift is simple. However, the details of how  the relative movement of air and airfoil interact to produce  the turning action that generates lift are complex. In any case  causing lift, an angled flat plate, revolving cylinder, airfoil,  etc., the flow meeting the leading edge of the object is forced to  split over and under the object. The sudden change in direction  over the object causes an area of low pressure to form behind  the leading edge on the upper surface of the object. In turn,  due to this pressure gradient and the viscosity of the fluid,  the flow over the object is accelerated down along the upper  surface of the object. At the same time, the flow forced under  the object is rapidly slowed or stagnated causing an area of  high pressure. This also causes the flow to accelerate along  the upper surface of the object. The two sections of the fluid  each leave the trailing edge of the object with a downward  component of momentum, producing lift.  [Figure 2-4]  

# Bernoulli’s Principle  

Bernoulli’s principle describes the relationship between  internal fluid pressure and fluid velocity. It is a statement  of the law of conservation of energy and helps explain why  an airfoil develops an aerodynamic force. The concept of  conservation of energy states energy cannot be created or  destroyed and the amount of energy entering a system must  also exit. Specifically, in this case the “energy” referred  to is the dynamic pressure (the kinetic energy of the air— more velocity, more kinetic energy) and static air pressure  (potential energy). These will change among themselves, but  the total pressure energy remains constant inside the tube.  

A simple tube with a constricted portion near the center of its  length illustrates this principle. An example is running water  through a garden hose. The mass of flow per unit area (cross- sectional area of tube) is the mass flow rate. In  Figure 2-5, the flow into the tube is constant, neither accelerating nor  decelerating; thus, the mass flow rate through the tube must  be the same at stations 1, 2, and 3. If the cross-sectional area  at any one of these stations—or any given point—in the  tube is reduced, the fluid velocity must increase to maintain  a constant mass flow rate to move the same amount of fluid  through a smaller area. The continuity of mass flow causes  the air to move faster through the venturi. In other words,  fluid speeds up in direct proportion to the reduction in area.  

![](images/27adfcf3b52e8882f5c2b7e58f3129f9912870303227041e21c9e176c895cb05.jpg)

Figure 2-5.  Water flow through a tube.  

Bernoulli   $(\mathrm{P_{total}=P_{d y n a m i c}+P_{s t a t i c}})$   states that the increase  in velocity will increase the streamwise dynamic pressure.  Since the total pressure in the tube must remain constant,  the static pressure on the sides of the venturi will decrease.  Venturi effect is the term used to describe this phenomenon.  

Figure 2-6  illustrates plates of one square foot in the dynamic  flow and on the sides of the tube indicating static pressure,  with corresponding pressure. At point 2, it is easier to  visualize the static pressure reduction on the top of the airfoil  as compared to the bottom of the airfoil, which is depicted as  outside of the tube and therefore at ambient static pressure.  Keep in mind with actual blades it is not a simple as this  example because the bottom static pressure is influenced by  blade design and blade angle, among other things. However,  the basic idea is that it is the static pressure differential  between the top and bottom multiplied by the surface area  of the blade that generates the aerodynamic force.  

# Venturi Flow  

While the amount of total energy within a closed system (the  tube) does not change, the form of the energy may be altered.  Pressure of flowing air may be compared to energy in that the  total pressure of flowing air always remains constant unless  energy is added or removed. Fluid flow pressure has two  components—static and dynamic pressure. Static pressure  is the pressure component measured in the flow but not  moving with the flow as pressure is measured. Static pressure  is also known as the force per unit area acting on a surface.  Dynamic pressure of flow is that component existing as a  result of movement of the air. The sum of these two pressures  is total pressure. As air flows through the constriction, static  pressure decreases as velocity increases. This increases  dynamic pressure.  Figure 2-7  depicts the bottom half of the  constricted area of the tube, which resembles the top half of  an airfoil. Even with the top half of the tube removed, the air  

![](images/992135d20264a28a97b17d6c4a96e9af393bdb57567e8884fa64baec7f548e40.jpg)

Figure 2-7.  Venturi flow.  

still accelerates over the curved area because the upper air  layers restrict the flow—just as the top half of the constricted  tube did. This acceleration causes decreased static pressure  above the curved portion and creates a pressure differential  caused by the variation of static and dynamic pressures.  

# Newton’s Third Law of Motion  

Additional lift is provided by the rotor blade’s lower surface  as air striking the underside is deflected downward. According  to Newton’s Third Law of Motion, “for every action there  is an equal and opposite reaction,” the air that is deflected  downward also produces an upward (lifting) reaction.  

Since air is much like water, the explanation for this source  of lift may be compared to the planing effect of skis on water.  The lift that supports the water skis (and the skier) is the force  caused by the impact pressure and the deflection of water  from the lower surfaces of the skis.  

Under most flying conditions, the impact pressure and the  deflection of air from the lower surface of the rotor blade  provides a comparatively small percentage of the total lift.  The majority of lift is the result of decreased pressure above  the blade, rather than the increased pressure below it.  

# Weight  

Normally, weight is thought of as being a known, fixed value,  such as the weight of the helicopter, fuel, and occupants. To  lift the helicopter off the ground vertically, the rotor disk must  generate enough lift to overcome or offset the total weight of  the helicopter and its occupants. Newton’s First Law states:  “Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain  in that state of motion unless an external force is applied  to it.” In this case, the object is the helicopter whether at a  hover or on the ground and the external force applied to it  is lift, which is accomplished by increasing the pitch angle  of the main rotor blades. This action forces the helicopter  into a state of motion, without it the helicopter would either  remain on the ground or at a hover.  

The weight of the helicopter can also be influenced by  aerodynamic loads. When you bank a helicopter while  maintaining a constant altitude, the “G” load or load factor  increases. The load factor is the actual load on the rotor  blades at any time, divided by the normal load or gross  weight (weight of the helicopter and its contents). Any time  a helicopter flies in a constant altitude curved flightpath, the  load supported by the rotor blades is greater than the total  weight of the helicopter. The tighter the curved flightpath  is, the steeper the bank is; the more rapid the flare or pullout  from a dive is, the greater the load supported by the rotor.  Therefore, the greater the load factor must be.  [Figure 2-8]  

To overcome this additional load factor, the helicopter must  be able to produce more lift. If excess engine power is not  available, the helicopter either descends or has to decelerate in  order to maintain the same altitude. The load factor and, hence,  

![](images/b1bd9ee68200bbb92a5fcb224faa8ffa0bd9c9c83b074e1b14aa8eea1bd72fb3.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.  The load factor diagram allows a pilot to calculate  the amount of “G” loading exerted with various angles of bank.  

apparent gross weight increase is relatively small in banks up  to  $30^{\circ}$  . Even so, under the right set of adverse circumstances,  such as high-density altitude, turbulent air, high gross weight,  and poor pilot technique, sufficient or excess power may not  be available to maintain altitude and airspeed. Pilots must take  all of these factors into consideration throughout the entire  flight from the point of ascending to a hover to landing. Above   $30^{\circ}$   of bank, the apparent increase in gross weight soars. At   $30^{\circ}$   of bank, or pitch, the apparent increase is only 16 percent,  but at  $60^{\circ}$  , it is twice the load on the wings and rotor disk.  For example, if the weight of the helicopter is 1,600 pounds,  the weight supported by the rotor disk in a   $30^{\circ}$   bank at a  constant altitude would be 1,856 pounds   $^{1,600+16}$   percent  (or 256)). In a  $60^{\circ}$   bank, it would be 3,200 pounds; in an  $80^{\circ}$    bank, it would be almost six times as much, or 8,000 pounds.  It is important to note that each rotor blade must support a  percentage of the gross weight. In a two-bladed system, each  blade of the 1,600-pound helicopter as stated above would  have to lift 50 percent or 800 pounds. If this same helicopter  had three rotor blades, each blade would have to lift only 33  percent, or 533 pounds. One additional cause of large load  factors is rough or turbulent air. The severe vertical gusts  produced by turbulence can cause a sudden increase in AOA,  resulting in increased rotor blade loads that are resisted by the  inertia of the helicopter.  

Each type of helicopter has its own limitations that are based  on the aircraft structure, size, and capabilities. Regardless  of how much weight one can carry or the engine power  that it may have, they are all susceptible to aerodynamic  overloading. Unfortunately, if the pilot attempts to push  the performance envelope the consequence can be fatal.  Aerodynamic forces effect every movement in a helicopter,  whether it is increasing the collective or a steep bank  angle. Anticipating results from a particular maneuver or  adjustment of a flight control is not good piloting technique.  Instead pilots need to truly understand the capabilities of the  helicopter under any and all circumstances and plan never to  exceed the flight envelope for any situation.  

# Thrust  

Thrust, like lift, is generated by the rotation of the main  rotor disk. In a helicopter, thrust can be forward, rearward,  sideward, or vertical. The resultant lift and thrust determines  the direction of movement of the helicopter.  

The solidity ratio is the ratio of the total rotor blade area,  which is the combined area of all the main rotor blades, to the  total rotor disk area. This ratio provides a means to measure  the potential for a rotor disk to provide thrust and lift. The  mathematical calculations needed to calculate the solidity ratio  for each helicopter may not be of importance to most pilots but  what should be are the capabilities of the rotor disk to produce  and maintain lift. Many helicopter accidents are caused from  the rotor disk being overloaded. Simply put, pilots attempt  maneuvers that require more lift than the rotor disk can  produce or more power than the helicopter’s powerplant can  provide. Trying to land with a nose high attitude along with  any other unfavorable condition (i.e., high gross weight or  wind gusts) is most likely to end in disaster.  

The tail rotor also produces thrust. The amount of thrust is  variable through the use of the antitorque pedals and is used  to control the helicopter’s yaw.  

# Drag  

The force that resists the movement of a helicopter through the  air and is produced when lift is developed is called drag. Drag  must be overcome by the engine to turn the rotor. Drag always  acts parallel to the relative wind. Total drag is composed of  three types of drag: profile, induced, and parasite.  

# Profile Drag  

Profile drag develops from the frictional resistance of the  blades passing through the air. It does not change significantly  with the airfoil’s AOA but increases moderately when  airspeed increases. Profile drag is composed of form drag and  skin friction. Form drag results from the turbulent wake caused  by the separation of airflow from the surface of a structure.  The amount of drag is related to both the size and shape of the  structure that protrudes into the relative wind.  [Figure 2-9]  

![](images/fbbe61337607327d57abb9045bed8a04a7d669b37fa3ce963928cf7914d30ff2.jpg)  
Figure 2-9.  It is easy to visualize the creation of form drag by  examining the airflow around a flat plate. Streamlining decreases  form drag by reducing the airflow separation.  

Skin friction is caused by surface roughness. Even though the  surface appears smooth, it may be quite rough when viewed  under a microscope. A thin layer of air clings to the rough  surface and creates small eddies that contribute to drag.  

# Induced Drag  

Induced drag is generated by the airflow circulation around  the rotor blade as it creates lift. The high-pressure area  beneath the blade joins the low-pressure area above the  blade at the trailing edge and at the rotor tips. This causes a  spiral, or vortex, which trails behind each blade whenever  lift is being produced. These vortices deflect the airstream  downward in the vicinity of the blade, creating an increase  in downwash. Therefore, the blade operates in an average  relative wind that is inclined downward and rearward near the  blade. Because the lift produced by the blade is perpendicular  to the relative wind, the lift is inclined aft by the same amount.  The component of lift that is acting in a rearward direction  is induced drag.  [Figure 2-10]  

As the air pressure differential increases with an increase in  AOA, stronger vortices form, and induced drag increases.  Since the blade’s AOA is usually lower at higher airspeeds,  and higher at low speeds, induced drag decreases as airspeed  increases and increases as airspeed decreases. Induced drag  is the major cause of drag at lower airspeeds.  

# Parasite Drag  

Parasite drag is present any time the helicopter is moving  through the air. This type of drag increases with airspeed.  Non-lifting components of the helicopter, such as the cabin,  rotor mast, tail, and landing gear, contribute to parasite drag.  Any loss of momentum by the airstream, due to such things  as openings for engine cooling, creates additional parasite  drag. Because of its rapid increase with increasing airspeed,  parasite drag is the major cause of drag at higher airspeeds.  Parasite drag varies with the square of the velocity; therefore,  

![](images/b66db0532be754b43ebdaa27f794f2d551cf60b69a99ae4e676ded679e828632.jpg)  
Figure 2-10.  The formation of induced drag is associated with the  downward deflection of the airstream near the rotor blade.  

doubling the airspeed increases the parasite drag four times.  

# Total Drag  

Total drag for a helicopter is the sum of all three drag forces.  [Figure 2-11]  As airspeed increases, parasite drag increases,  while induced drag decreases. Profile drag remains relatively  constant throughout the speed range with some increase at  higher airspeeds. Combining all drag forces results in a total  drag curve. The low point on the total drag curve shows the  airspeed at which drag is minimized. This is the point where  the lift-to-drag ratio is greatest and is referred to as  $\mathrm{L/D_{MAX}}$  .  At this speed, the total lift capacity of the helicopter, when  compared to the total drag of the helicopter, is most favorable.  This is an important factor in helicopter performance.  

# Airfoil  

Helicopters are able to fly due to aerodynamic forces  produced when air passes around the airfoil. An airfoil is  any surface producing more lift than drag when passing  through the air at a suitable angle. Airfoils are most often  associated with production of lift. Airfoils are also used for  stability (fin), control (elevator), and thrust or propulsion  (propeller or rotor). Certain airfoils, such as rotor blades,  combine some of these functions. The main and tail rotor  blades of the helicopter are airfoils, and air is forced to pass  around the blades by mechanically powered rotation. In  some conditions, parts of the fuselage, such as the vertical  and horizontal stabilizers, can become airfoils. Airfoils are  carefully structured to accommodate a specific set of flight  characteristics.  

# Airfoil Terminology and Definitions  

•	 Blade span—the length of the rotor blade from center  of rotation to tip of the blade.  

![](images/b742361129905f021995b2b7dd84096e1203c343ed318146626a4e211827cb8f.jpg)  
Figure 2-11.  The total drag curve represents the combined forces of  parasite, profile, and induced drag and is plotted against airspeed.  

•	 Chord line—a straight line intersecting leading and  trailing edges of the airfoil.  [Figure 2-12]  

 •	 Chord—the length of the chord line from leading edge  to trailing edge; it is the characteristic longitudinal  dimension of the airfoil section.

 •	 Mean camber line—a line drawn halfway between the  upper and lower surfaces of the airfoil.  [Figure 2-12]  

The chord line connects the ends of the mean camber  line. Camber refers to curvature of the airfoil and  may be considered as curvature of the mean camber  line. The shape of the mean camber is important for  determining aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil  section. Maximum camber (displacement of the mean  camber line from the chord line) and its location help  to define the shape of the mean camber line. The  location of maximum camber and its displacement  from the chord line are expressed as fractions or  percentages of the basic chord length. By varying the  point of maximum camber, the manufacturer can tailor  an airfoil for a specific purpose. The profile thickness  and thickness distribution are important properties of  an airfoil section.  

•	 Leading edge—the front edge of an airfoil.  [Figure 2-12]  

•	 Flightpath velocity—the speed and direction of  the airfoil passing through the air. For airfoils on  an airplane, the flightpath velocity is equal to true  airspeed (TAS). For helicopter rotor blades, flightpath  velocity is equal to rotational velocity, plus or minus  a component of directional airspeed. The rotational  velocity of the rotor blade is lowest closer to the hub  and increases outward towards the tip of the blade  during rotation.

 •	 Relative wind—defined as the airflow relative to  an airfoil and is created by movement of an airfoil  through the air. This is rotational relative wind for  rotary-wing aircraft and is covered in detail later. As  an induced airflow may modify flightpath velocity,  

![](images/47120e69b278f4857d578c230064f4630efc7a9085a5364991f26c3b6b648ebc.jpg)  
Figure 2-12.  Aerodynamic terms of an airfoil.  

relative wind experienced by the airfoil may not be  exactly opposite its direction of travel. •	 Trailing edge—the rearmost edge of an airfoil.  •	 Induced flow—the downward flow of air through the  rotor disk.  •	 Resultant relative wind—relative wind modified by  induced flow. •	 AOA—the angle measured between the resultant  relative wind and chord line.  •	 Angle of incidence (AOI)—the angle between the  chord line of a blade and rotor hub. It is usually  referred to as blade pitch angle. For fixed airfoils,  such as vertical fins or elevators, angle of incidence  is the angle between the chord line of the airfoil and  a selected reference plane of the helicopter. •	 Center of pressure—the point along the chord line of  an airfoil through which all aerodynamic forces are  considered to act. Since pressures vary on the surface  of an airfoil, an average location of pressure variation is  needed. As the AOA changes, these pressures change,  and the center of pressure moves along the chord line.  

# Airfoil Types Symmetrical Airfoil  

The symmetrical airfoil is distinguished by having identical  upper and lower surfaces.  [Figure 2-13]  The mean camber  line and chord line are the same on a symmetrical airfoil,  and it produces no lift at zero AOA. Most light helicopters  incorporate symmetrical airfoils in the main rotor blades.  

# Nonsymmetrical Airfoil (Cambered)  

The nonsymmetrical airfoil has different upper and lower  surfaces, with a greater curvature of the airfoil above the  chord line than below.  [Figure 2-13]  The mean camber line  and chord line are different. The nonsymmetrical airfoil design  can produce useful lift at zero AOA. A nonsymmetrical design  

![](images/e9fa2bc092f0007bea773d9e7cc4882d5c2e2d8f355eb47e8205b5946870d1f6.jpg)  
Figure 2-13.  The upper and lower curvatures are the same on a  symmetrical airfoil and vary on a nonsymmetrical airfoil.  

has advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are more  lift production at a given AOA than a symmetrical design,  an improved lift-to-drag ratio, and better stall characteristics.  The disadvantages are center of pressure travel of up to 20  percent of the chord line (creating undesirable torque on the  airfoil structure) and greater production costs.  

# Blade Twist  

Because of lift differential due to differing rotational relative  wind values along the blade, the blade should be designed  with a twist to alleviate internal blade stress and distribute  the lifting force more evenly along the blade. Blade twist  provides higher pitch angles at the root where velocity is  low and lower pitch angles nearer the tip where velocity  is higher. This increases the induced air velocity and blade  loading near the inboard section of the blade.  [Figure 2-14]  

# Rotor Blade and Hub Definitions  

•	 Hub—on the mast, the attaching point for the root of  the blade, and the axis about which the blades rotate.  [See Figure 1-7] •	 Tip—the farthest outboard section of the rotor blade •	 Root—the inner end of the blade and is the point that  attaches to the hub •	 Twist—the change in blade incidence from the root  to the outer blade  

The angular position of the main rotor blades (as viewed from  above, as they rotate about the vertical axis of the mast) is  measured from the helicopter’s longitudinal axis, and usually  from its nose. The radial position of a segment of the blade is  the distance from the hub as a fraction of the total distance.  

# Airflow and Reactions in the Rotor Disk  

# Relative Wind  

Knowledge of relative wind is essential for an understanding  of aerodynamics and its practical flight application for the  pilot. Relative wind is airflow relative to an airfoil. Movement  of an airfoil through the air creates relative wind. Relative  wind moves in a direction parallel to but opposite of the  movement of the airfoil.  [Figure 2-15]  

There are two parts to wind passing a rotor blade:  

•	 Horizontal part—caused by the blades turning  plus movement of the helicopter through the air  [Figure 2-16]  •	 Vertical part—caused by the air being forced down  through the rotor blades plus any movement of the air  relative to the blades caused by the helicopter climbing  or descending  [Figures 2-17  and  2-18]  

# Rotational Relative Wind (Tip-Path Plane)  

The rotation of rotor blades as they turn about the mast  produces rotational relative wind (tip-path plane). The  term rotational refers to the method of producing relative  wind. Rotational relative wind flows opposite the physical  flightpath of the airfoil, striking the blade at   $90^{\circ}$   to the  leading edge and parallel to the plane of rotation; and it is  constantly changing in direction during rotation. Rotational  relative wind velocity is highest at blade tips, decreasing  uniformly to zero at the axis of rotation (center of the  mast).  [Figure 2-19]

Figure 2-19.  Rotational relative wind.  

# Resultant Relative Wind  

The resultant relative wind at a hover is rotational relative  wind modified by induced flow. This is inclined downward  at some angle and opposite the effective flightpath of the  airfoil, rather than the physical flightpath (rotational relative  wind). The resultant relative wind also serves as the reference  plane for development of lift, drag, and total aerodynamic  force (TAF) vectors on the airfoil.  [Figure 2-20]  When the  helicopter has horizontal motion, airspeed further modifies  the resultant relative wind. The airspeed component of  relative wind results from the helicopter moving through  the air. This airspeed component is added to, or subtracted  from, the rotational relative wind depending on whether  the blade is advancing or retreating in relation to helicopter  movement. Introduction of airspeed relative wind also  modifies induced flow. Generally, the downward velocity  of induced flow is reduced. The pattern of air circulation  through the disk changes when the aircraft has horizontal  motion. As the helicopter gains airspeed, the addition of  

![](images/6eab502c545a1b6f02b14d8ea905257623dd1ae2b6148dca2218354d06f07f83.jpg)  
Figure 2-20.  Resultant relative wind.  

forward velocity results in decreased induced flow velocity.  This change results in an improved efficiency (additional lift)  being produced from a given blade pitch setting.  

# Induced Flow (Downwash)  

At flat pitch, air leaves the trailing edge of the rotor blade  in the same direction it moved across the leading edge; no  lift or induced flow is being produced. As blade pitch angle  is increased, the rotor disk induces a downward flow of air  through the rotor blades creating a downward component of  air that is added to the rotational relative wind. Because the  blades are moving horizontally, some of the air is displaced  downward. The blades travel along the same path and pass a  given point in rapid succession. Rotor blade action changes the  still air to a column of descending air. Therefore, each blade has  a decreased AOA due to the downwash. This downward flow  of air is called induced flow (downwash). It is most pronounced  at a hover under no-wind conditions.  [Figure 2-21]  

![](images/b369c7a7341d551ee4e5291a56c9b88fb5bab7fe80e822a78d772174518e1ec7.jpg)  
Figure 2-21.  A helicopter in forward flight, or hovering with a headwind or crosswind, has more molecules of air entering the aft portion  of the rotor disk. Therefore, at the rear of the rotor disk, the angle of attack is less and the induced flow is greater.  

In Ground Effect (IGE)  

Ground effect is the increased efficiency of the rotor  disk caused by interference of the airflow when near the  ground. The air pressure or density is increased, which  acts to decrease the downward velocity of air. Ground  effect permits relative wind to be more horizontal, lift  vector to be more vertical, and induced drag to be reduced.  These conditions allow the rotor disk to be more efficient.  Maximum ground effect is achieved when hovering over  smooth hard surfaces. When hovering over surfaces as tall  grass, trees, bushes, rough terrain, and water, maximum  ground effect is reduced. Rotor efficiency is increased  by ground effect to a height of about one rotor diameter  (measured from the ground to the rotor disk) for most  helicopters. Since the induced flow velocities are decreased,  the AOA is increased, which requires a reduced blade pitch  angle and a reduction in induced drag. This reduces the  power required to hover IGE.  [Figure 2-22]  

# Out of Ground Effect (OGE)  

The benefit of placing the helicopter near the ground is lost  above IGE altitude. Above this altitude, the power required  to hover remains nearly constant, given similar conditions  (such as wind). Induced flow velocity is increased, resulting  in a decrease in AOA and a decrease in lift. Under the correct  circumstances, this downward flow can become so localized  that the helicopter and locally disturbed air will sink at  alarming rates. This effect is called vortex ring state (formerly  referenced as settling-with-power) and is discussed at length  in Chapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards. A higher  blade pitch angle is required to maintain the same AOA as in  IGE hover. The increased pitch angle also creates more drag.  This increased pitch angle and drag requires more power to  hover OGE than IGE. [Figure 2-23]  

# Rotor Blade Angles  

There are two angles that enable a rotor disk to produce the  lift required for a helicopter to fly: angle of incidence and  angle of attack.  

# Angle of Incidence  

Angle of incidence is the angle between the chord line of a  main or tail rotor blade and its rotor disk. It is a mechanical  angle rather than an aerodynamic angle and is sometimes  referred to as blade pitch angle.  [Figure 2-24]  In the absence  of induced flow, AOA and angle of incidence are the same.  Whenever induced flow, up flow (inflow), or airspeed modifies  the relative wind, the AOA is different from the angle of  incidence. Collective input and cyclic feathering (see page  2-12) change the angle of incidence. A change in the angle of  incidence changes the AOA, which changes the coefficient of  lift, thereby changing the lift produced by the airfoil.

Figure 2-24.  Angle of incidence.  

# Angle of Attack  

AOA is the angle between the airfoil chord line and resultant  relative wind.  [Figure 2-25]  It is an aerodynamic angle and  not easy to measure. It can change with no change in the blade  pitch angle (angle of incidence, discussed earlier).  

When the AOA is increased, air flowing over the airfoil is  diverted over a greater distance, resulting in an increase of  air velocity and more lift. As the AOA is increased further,  it becomes more difficult for air to flow smoothly across the  top of the airfoil. At this point, the airflow begins to separate  from the airfoil and enters a burbling or turbulent pattern.  The turbulence results in a large increase in drag and loss of  lift in the area where it is taking place. Increasing the AOA  increases lift until the critical angle of attack is reached. Any  increase in the AOA beyond this point produces a stall and  

![](images/fca66929e5c310a3d16486f6707e9ffa724d2d3b0d38ca9edd83619b551268d5.jpg)  
Figure 2-25.  The AOA is the angle between the airfoil chord line  and resultant relative wind.  

a rapid decrease in lift (refer to the Low Rotor RPM and  Rotor Stall section of Chapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies  and Hazards).  

Several factors may change the rotor blade AOA. The pilot  has little direct control over AOA except indirectly through  the flight control input. Collective and cyclic feathering  help to make these changes. Feathering is the rotation of the  blade about its longitudinal axis by collective/cyclic inputs  causing changes in blade pitch angle. Collective feathering  changes angle of incidence equally and in the same direction  on all rotor blades simultaneously. This action changes AOA,  which changes coefficient of lift (CL), and affects overall  lift of the rotor disk.  

Cyclic feathering changes the blade’s AOA differentially  around the rotor disk and creates a differential lift. Aviators  use cyclic feathering to control attitude of the rotor disk. It  is the means to control rearward tilt of the rotor (blowback)  caused by flapping action and (along with blade flapping)  counteract dissymmetry of lift (discussed in chapter 3). Cyclic  feathering causes attitude of the rotor disk to change but does  not change the amount of net lift the rotor disk is producing.  

Most of the changes in AOA come from change in airspeed  and rate of climb or descent; others such as flapping occur  automatically due to the rotor system design. Flapping is the  up and down movement of rotor blades about a hinge on a  fully articulated rotor system. A semi-rigid system does not  have a hinge but flap as a unit. A rigid rotor system has no  vertical or horizontal hinges, so the blades cannot flap or  drag, but they can flex. By flexing, the blades themselves  compensate for the forces which previously required rugged  hinges. It occurs in response to changes in lift due to changing  velocity or cyclic feathering. No flapping occurs when the tip- path plane is perpendicular to the mast. The flapping action  alone, or along with cyclic feathering, controls dissymmetry  of lift. Flapping is the primary means of compensating for  dissymmetry of lift.  

Pilots adjust AOA through normal control manipulation of  the pitch angle of the blades. If the pitch angle is increased,  the AOA increases; if the pitch angle is reduced, the AOA  is reduced.  

# Powered Flight  

In powered flight (hovering, vertical, forward, sideward,  or rearward), the total lift and thrust forces of a rotor are  perpendicular to the rotor disk.  

# Hovering Flight  

Hovering is the most challenging part of flying a helicopter.  This is because a helicopter generates its own gusty air  while in a hover, which acts against the fuselage and flight  control surfaces. The end result is constant control inputs  and corrections by the pilot to keep the helicopter where it is  required to be. Despite the complexity of the task, the control  inputs in a hover are simple. The cyclic is used to eliminate  drift in the horizontal plane, controlling forward, backward,  right and left movement or travel. The throttle, if not governor  controlled, is used to control revolutions per minute (rpm). The  collective is used to maintain altitude. The pedals are used to  control nose direction or heading. It is the interaction of these  controls that makes hovering difficult, since an adjustment  in any one control requires an adjustment of the other two,  creating a cycle of constant correction. During hovering flight,  a helicopter maintains a constant position over a selected  point, usually a few feet above the ground. The ability of the  helicopter to hover comes from the both the lift component,  which is the force developed by the main rotor(s) to overcome  gravity and aircraft weight, and the thrust component, which  acts horizontally to accelerate or decelerate the helicopter in  the desired direction. Pilots direct the thrust of the rotor disk  by using the cyclic to rotate the rotor disk plane relative to the  horizon. They do this in order to induce travel or compensate  for the wind and hold a position. At a hover in a no-wind  condition, all opposing forces (lift, thrust, drag, and weight)  are in balance; they are equal and opposite. Therefore, lift  and weight are equal, resulting in the helicopter remaining at  a stationary hover.  [Figure 2-26]  

While hovering, the amount of main rotor thrust can be  adjusted to maintain the desired hovering height. This is done  by changing the angle of incidence (by moving the collective)  of the rotor blades, and hence their AOA. Changing the AOA  changes the drag on the rotor blades, and the power delivered  by the engine must change as well to keep the rotor speed  constant.  

The weight that must be supported is the total weight of the  helicopter and its occupants. If the amount of lift is greater  than the actual weight, the helicopter accelerates upwards  until the lift force equals the weight of the helicopter; if lift  is less than weight, the helicopter accelerates downward.  

The drag of a hovering helicopter is mainly induced drag  incurred while the blades are producing lift. There is, however,  some profile drag on the blades as they rotate through the air  and a small amount of parasite drag from the non-lift-producing  surfaces of the helicopter, such as the rotor hub, cowlings, and  

![](images/4e9fb5cb08bfd7650196c2f98d83160936632f417c120d3a6d5a0ad37f0dae72.jpg)  
Figure 2-26.  To maintain a hover at a constant altitude, the lift  must equal the weight of the helicopter. Thrust must equal any  wind and tail rotor thrust to maintain position. The power must be  sufficient to turn the rotors and overcome the various drags and  frictions involved.  

landing gear. Throughout the rest of this discussion, the term  “drag” includes induced, profile and parasite drag.  

An important consequence of producing thrust is torque.  As discussed earlier, Newton’s Third Law states: for every  action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, as  the engine turns the main rotor disk in a counterclockwise  direction, the helicopter fuselage wants to turn clockwise.  The amount of torque is directly related to the amount of  engine power being used to turn the main rotor disk. As  power changes, torque changes.  

To counteract this torque-induced turning tendency, an  antitorque rotor or tail rotor is incorporated into most  helicopter designs. A pilot can vary the amount of thrust  produced by the tail rotor in relation to the amount of torque  produced by the engine. As the engine supplies more power  to the main rotor, the tail rotor must produce more thrust to  overcome the increased torque effect. This control change  is accomplished through the use of antitorque pedals (See  page 3-4).  

# Translating Tendency (Drift)  

During hovering flight, a single main rotor helicopter tends  to move in the direction of tail rotor thrust. This lateral 

 (or sideward) movement is called translating tendency. 

 [Figure 2-27]  

To counteract this tendency, one or more of the following  features may be used. All examples are for a counterclockwise  rotating main rotor disk.  

![](images/7f84ea8ba188f7044a0f713043798d7348d09736c2b188a7465784dddbb26587.jpg)  
Figure 2-27.  A tail rotor is designed to produce thrust in a direction  opposite torque. The thrust produced by the tail rotor is sufficient  to move the helicopter laterally.  

•	 The main transmission is mounted at a slight angle to  the left (when viewed from behind) so that the rotor  mast has a built-in tilt to oppose the tail rotor thrust.  •	 Flight controls can be rigged so that the rotor disk is  tilted to the left slightly when the cyclic is centered.  Whichever method is used, the tip-path plane is tilted  slightly to the left in the hover.  •	 The transmission is mounted so the rotor shaft is  vertical with respect to the fuselage, the helicopter  “hangs” left skid low in the hover. (The opposite is  true for rotor disks turning clockwise when viewed  from above.) •	 The helicopter fuselage will also be tilted when the  tail rotor is below the main rotor disk and supplying  antitorque thrust. The fuselage tilt is caused by the  imperfect balance of the tail rotor thrust against the  main rotor torque in the same plane. The helicopter  tilts due to two separate forces, the main rotor disk tilt  to neutralize the translating tendency and the lower  tail rotor thrust below the plane of the torque action. •	 In forward flight, the tail rotor continues to push  to the right, and the helicopter makes a small angle  with the wind when the rotors are level and the slip  ball is in the middle (See page 12-2). This is called  inherent sideslip. For some larger helicopters, the  vertical fin or stabilizer is often designed with the  tail rotor mounted on them to correct this side slip  and to eliminate some of the tilting at a hover. (By  mounting the tail rotor on top of the vertical fin or  pylon, the antitorque is more in line with or closer  to the horizontal plane of torque, resulting in less  airframe (or body) lean from the tail rotor.) Also,  having the tail rotor higher off the ground reduces  the risk of objects coming in contact with the blades,  but at the cost of increased weight and complexity.  

# Pendular Action  

Since the fuselage of the helicopter, with a single main rotor,  is suspended from a single point and has considerable mass, it  is free to oscillate either longitudinally or laterally in the same  way as a pendulum. This pendular action can be exaggerated  by overcontrolling; therefore, control movements should be  smooth and not exaggerated.  [Figure 2-28]  

The horizontal stabilizer helps to level the helicopter in  forward flight. However, in rearward flight, the horizontal  stabilizer can press the tail downward, resulting in a tail  strike if the helicopter is moved rearward into the wind.  Normally, with the helicopter mostly into the wind, the  horizontal stabilizer experiences less headwind component  as the helicopter begins rearward travel (downwind). When  

![](images/6a469e2e37ad3af62b98e821791e58c67af5632ccee98c14988d7cc961e60fe1.jpg)  
Figure 2-28.  Because the helicopter’s body has mass and is  suspended from a single point (the rotor mast head), it tends to act  much like a pendulum.  

rearward flight groundspeed equals the windspeed, then  the helicopter is merely hovering in a no-wind condition.  However, rearward hovering into the wind requires  considerable care and caution to prevent tail strikes.  

It is important to note that there is a difference in the amount  of pendular action between a semirigid system and a fully  articulated system. Because of the hard connection (offset)  of the latter, the centrifugal force pulling out on the blades is  transferred to the fuselage, and the fuselage tends to follow  the rotor attitude. The semirigid system is a true pendulum,  with thrust required to create a moment around the fuselage  CG to allow for control of the fuselage. This comes into play  later when mast bumping is discussed.  

# Coning  

In order for a helicopter to generate lift, the rotor blades  must be turning. Rotor disk rotation drives the blades into  the air, creating a relative wind component without having  to move the airframe through the air as with an airplane or  glider. Depending on the motion of the blades and helicopter  airframe, many factors cause the relative wind direction to  vary. The rotation of the rotor disk creates centrifugal force  (inertia), which tends to pull the blades straight outward  from the main rotor hub: the faster the rotation, the greater  the centrifugal force, the slower the rotation, the smaller  the centrifugal force. This force gives the rotor blades their  rigidity and, in turn, the strength to support the weight of  the helicopter. The maximum centrifugal force generated  is determined by the maximum operating rotor revolutions  per minute (rpm).  

As lift on the blades is increased (in a takeoff, for example),  two major forces are acting at the same time—centrifugal  force acting outward, and lift acting upward. The result of  these two forces is that the blades assume a conical path  instead of remaining in the plane perpendicular to the mast.  This can be seen in any helicopter when it takes off; the rotor  disk changes from flat to a slight cone shape.  [Figure 2-29]  

If the rotor rpm is allowed to go too low (below the minimum  power-on rotor rpm, for example), the centrifugal force  becomes smaller and the coning angle becomes much  larger. In other words, should the rpm decrease too much,  at some point the rotor blades fold up with no chance  of recovery.  

# Coriolis Effect (Law of Conservation of Angular  Momentum)  

The Coriolis Effect is also referred to as the law of  conservation of angular momentum. It states that the value  of angular momentum of a rotating body does not change  unless an external force is applied. In other words, a rotating  body continues to rotate with the same rotational velocity  until some external force is applied to change the speed of  rotation. Angular momentum is the moment of inertia (mass  times distance from the center of rotation squared) multiplied  by the speed of rotation.  

Changes in angular velocity, known as angular acceleration  and deceleration, take place as the mass of a rotating body  is moved closer to or farther away from the axis of rotation.  The speed of the rotating mass varies proportionately with  the square of the radius.  

An excellent example of this principle in action is a figure  skater performing a spin on ice skates. The skater begins  rotation on one foot, with the other leg and both arms  extended. The rotation of the skater’s body is relatively  slow. When a skater draws both arms and one leg inward,  the moment of inertia (mass times radius squared) becomes

much smaller and the body is rotating almost faster than the  eye can follow. Because the angular momentum must, by  law of nature, remain the same (no external force applied),  the angular velocity must increase.  

The rotor blade rotating about the rotor hub possesses angular  momentum. As the rotor begins to cone due to G-loading  maneuvers, the diameter of the rotor disk shrinks. Due to  conservation of angular momentum, the blades increase  speed even though the blade tips have a shorter distance to  travel due to reduced disk diameter. The action results in an  increase in rotor rpm which causes a slight increase in lift.  Most pilots arrest this increase of rpm with an increase in  collective pitch. This increase in blade rpm lift is somewhat  negated by the slightly smaller disk area as the blades cone  upward.  

# Gyroscopic Precession  

The spinning main rotor of a helicopter acts like a gyroscope.  As such, it has the properties of gyroscopic action, one of  which is precession. Gyroscopic precession is the resultant  action or deflection of a spinning object when a force is  applied to this object. This action occurs approximately  $90^{\circ}$  in the direction of rotation from the point where the force  is applied (or   $90^{\circ}$   later in the rotation cycle).  [Figure 2-30]  

Examine a two-bladed rotor disk to see how gyroscopic  precession affects the movement of the tip-path plane.  Moving the cyclic pitch control increases the angle of  incidence of one rotor blade with the result of a greater lifting  force being applied at that point in the plane of rotation.  This same control movement simultaneously decreases the  angle of incidence of the other blade the same amount, thus  

![](images/3207db3d614063ee46ae9079f137b85049b678dd698f631ea1338429dd7bbb69.jpg)  
Figure 2-30.  Gyroscopic precession.  

decreasing the lifting force applied at that point in the plane of  rotation. The blade with the increased angle of incidence tends  to flap up; the blade with the decreased angle of incidence  tends to flap down. Because the rotor disk acts like a gyro, the  blades reach maximum deflection at a point approximately   $90^{\circ}$   later in the plane of rotation.  Figure 2-31  illustrates the  result of a forward cyclic input. The retreating blade angle  of incidence is increased, and the advancing blade angle of  incidence is decreased resulting in a tipping forward of the  tip-path plane, since maximum deflection takes place   $90°$    later when the blades are at the rear and front, respectively. In a rotor disk using three or more blades, the movement of  the cyclic pitch control changes the angle of incidence of each  blade an appropriate amount so that the end result is the same.  

# Vertical Flight  

Hovering is actually an element of vertical flight. Increasing  the angle of incidence of the rotor blades (pitch) while  keeping their rotation speed constant generates additional  lift and the helicopter ascends. Decreasing the pitch causes  the helicopter to descend. In a no-wind condition in which  lift and thrust are less than weight and drag, the helicopter  descends vertically. If lift and thrust are greater than weight  and drag, the helicopter ascends vertically.  [Figure 2-32]  

# Forward Flight  

In steady forward flight, with no change in airspeed or vertical  speed, the four forces of lift, thrust, drag, and weight must  be in balance. Once the tip-path plane is tilted forward, the  total lift-thrust force is also tilted forward. This resultant  lift-thrust force can be resolved into two components—lift  acting vertically upward and thrust acting horizontally in the  direction of flight. In addition to lift and thrust, there is weight  (the downward acting force) and drag (the force opposing the  motion of an airfoil through the air).  [Figure 2-33]  

In straight-and-level, unaccelerated forward flight (straight- and-level flight is flight with a constant heading and at a  constant altitude), lift equals weight and thrust equals drag.  If lift exceeds weight, the helicopter accelerates vertically  until the forces are in balance; if thrust is less than drag, the  helicopter slows down until the forces are in balance. As a  helicopter initiates a move forward, it begins to lose altitude  because lift is lost as thrust is diverted forward. However,  as the helicopter begins to accelerate from a hover, the rotor  disk becomes more efficient due to translational lift (see  translational lift on page 2-19). The result is excess power  over that which is required to hover. Continued acceleration  causes an even larger increase in airflow through the rotor  disk (up to a maximum determined by drag and the engine’s  limit of power), and more efficient flight. In order to maintain  unaccelerated flight, the pilot must understand that with  

![](images/39a8854b7cf99173a9e7e40babebac9e6c5dfed6507528dd4e03a3e40c1579bf.jpg)  
Figure 2-31.  As each blade passes the   $90^{\circ}$   position on the left in a counterclockwise main rotor blade rotation, the maximum increase  in angle of incidence occurs. As each blade passes the  $90^{\circ}$   position to the right, the maximum decrease in angle of incidence occurs.  Maximum deflection takes place  $90^{\circ}$   later—maximum upward deflection at the rear and maximum downward deflection at the front—and  the tip-path plane tips forward.  

![](images/01d046fd23d4f389f55b5b4e821dac6cb5d74bc8ba744c3023545f8373470311.jpg)  
Figure 2-33.  To transition to forward flight, more lift and thrust must  be generated to overcome the forces of weight and drag.  

any changes in power or in cyclic movement, the helicopter  begins either to climb or to descend. Once straight-and-level  flight is obtained, the pilot should make note of the power  (torque setting) required and not make major adjustments to  the flight controls.  [Figure 2-34]  

# Airflow in Forward Flight  

Airflow across the rotor disk in forward flight varies from  airflow at a hover. In forward flight, air flows opposite the  aircraft’s flightpath. The velocity of this air flow equals the  helicopter’s forward speed. Because the rotor blades turn  in a circular pattern, the velocity of airflow across a blade  depends on the position of the blade in the plane of rotation  at a given instant, its rotational velocity, and airspeed of the  helicopter. Therefore, the airflow meeting each blade varies  continuously as the blade rotates. The highest velocity of  airflow occurs over the right side (3 o’clock position) of  the helicopter (advancing blade in a rotor disk that turns  counterclockwise) and decreases to rotational velocity over  the nose. It continues to decrease until the lowest velocity of  airflow occurs over the left side (9 o’clock position) of the  helicopter (retreating blade). As the blade continues to rotate,  velocity of the airflow then increases to rotational velocity  over the tail. It continues to increase until the blade is back  at the 3 o’clock position.  

The advancing blade in  Figure 2-35,  position A, moves in  the same direction as the helicopter. The velocity of the air  meeting this blade equals rotational velocity of the blade  plus wind velocity resulting from forward airspeed. The  retreating blade (position C) moves in a flow of air moving

in the opposite direction of the helicopter. The velocity of  airflow meeting this blade equals rotational velocity of the  blade minus wind velocity resulting from forward airspeed.  The blades (positions B and D) over the nose and tail move  essentially at right angles to the airflow created by forward  airspeed; the velocity of airflow meeting these blades equals  the rotational velocity. This results in a change to velocity  of airflow all across the rotor disk and a change to the lift  pattern of the rotor disk.  

# Advancing Blade  

As the relative wind speed of the advancing blade increases,  the blade gains lift and begins to flap up. It reaches its  maximum upflap velocity at the 3 o’clock position, where the  wind velocity is the greatest. This upflap creates a downward  flow of air and has the same effect as increasing the induced  flow velocity by imposing a downward vertical velocity  vector to the relative wind which decreases the AOA.  

# Retreating Blade  

As relative wind speed of the retreating blade decreases,  the blade loses lift and begins to flap down. It reaches its  maximum downflap velocity at the 9 o’clock position, where  wind velocity is the least. This downflap creates an upward  flow of air and has the same effect as decreasing the induced  flow velocity by imposing an upward velocity vertical vector  to the relative wind which increases the AOA.  

# Dissymmetry of Lift  

Dissymmetry of lift is the differential (unequal) lift between  advancing and retreating halves of the rotor disk caused by the  different wind flow velocity across each half. This difference  in lift would cause the helicopter to be uncontrollable in any  situation other than hovering in a calm wind. There must  be a means of compensating, correcting, or eliminating this  unequal lift to attain symmetry of lift.  

When the helicopter moves through the air, the relative  airflow through the main rotor disk is different on the  advancing side from the retreating side. The relative wind  encountered by the advancing blade is increased by the  forward speed of the helicopter, while the relative wind speed  acting on the retreating blade is reduced by the helicopter’s  forward airspeed. Therefore, as a result of the relative wind  speed, the advancing blade side of the rotor disk can produce  more lift than the retreating blade side.  [Figure 2-36]  

If this condition were allowed to exist, a helicopter with a  counterclockwise main rotor blade rotation would roll to the  left because of the difference in lift. In reality, the main rotor  blades flap and feather automatically to equalize lift across  the rotor disk. Articulated rotor disks, usually with three or  more blades, incorporate a horizontal hinge (flapping hinge)  to allow the individual rotor blades to move, or flap up and  down as they rotate. A semi-rigid rotor disk (two blades)  utilizes a teetering hinge, which allows the blades to flap as  a unit. When one blade flaps up, the other blade flaps down.  

As shown in  Figure 2-37,  as the rotor blade reaches the  advancing side of the rotor disk (A), it reaches its maximum  up flap velocity. When the blade flaps upward, the angle  between the chord line and the resultant relative wind  decreases. This decreases the AOA, which reduces the  amount of lift produced by the blade. At position (C), the  rotor blade is now at its maximum down flapping velocity.  Due to down flapping, the angle between the chord line and  the resultant relative wind increases. This increases the AOA  and thus the amount of lift produced by the blade.  

The combination of blade flapping and slow relative wind  acting on the retreating blade normally limits the maximum  forward speed of a helicopter. At a high forward speed,  the retreating blade stalls because of a high AOA and slow  relative wind speed. This situation is called retreating blade  stall and is evidenced by a nose pitch up, vibration, and a  rolling tendency—usually to the left in helicopters with  counterclockwise blade rotation.  

![](images/b0f18967fa4c5c18d89f800f51aa6ca1c280ce6bfa3eaba7788364710aa42ed3.jpg)  
Figure 2-36.  The blade tip speed of this helicopter is approximately  400 knots. If the helicopter is moving forward at 100 knots, the  relative windspeed on the advancing side is 500 knots. On the  retreating side, it is only 300 knots. This difference in speed causes  a dissymmetry of lift.  

Pilots can avoid retreating blade stall by not exceeding the  never-exceed speed. This speed is designated   $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   and is  indicated on a placard and marked on the airspeed indicator  by a red line.  

Blade flapping compensates for dissymmetry of lift in the  following way. At a hover, equal lift is produced around the  rotor disk with equal pitch (AOI) on all the blades and at  all points in the rotor disk (disregarding compensation for  translating tendency). The rotor disk is parallel to the horizon.  To develop a thrust force, the rotor disk must be tilted in the  desired direction of movement. Cyclic feathering changes  the angle of incidence differentially around the rotor disk.  For a counterclockwise rotation, forward cyclic movement  decreases the angle of incidence on the right of the rotor disk  and increases it on the left.  

When transitioning to forward flight either from a hover or  taking off from the ground, pilots must be aware that as the  helicopter speed increases, translational lift becomes more  effective and causes the nose to rise or pitch up (sometimes  referred to as blowback). This tendency is caused by the  combined effects of dissymmetry of lift and transverse flow.  Pilots must correct for this tendency by maintaining a constant  rotor disk attitude that will move the helicopter through the  speed range in which blowback occurs. If the nose is permitted  to pitch up while passing through this speed range, the aircraft  may also tend to roll to the right. To correct for this tendency,  the pilot must continuously move the cyclic forward as velocity  of the helicopter increases until the takeoff is complete, and  the helicopter has transitioned into forward flight.  

![](images/9a08df1335755269199fa2de521b7d31f614307ad6c333bdf73470814c33ffba.jpg)  
Figure 2-37.  The combined upward flapping (reduced lift) of the advancing blade and downward flapping (increased lift) of the retreating  blade equalizes lift across the main rotor disk, counteracting dissymmetry of lift.  

Figure 2-38  illustrates the tilting forward of the rotor disk,  which is the result of a change in pitch angle with forward  cyclic. At a hover, the cyclic is centered and the pitch angle on  the advancing and retreating blades is the same. At low forward  speeds, moving the cyclic forward reduces pitch angle on the  advancing blade and increases pitch angle on the retreating  blade. This causes a slight rotor disk tilt. At higher forward  speeds, the pilot must continue to move the cyclic forward.  This further reduces pitch angle on the advancing blade and  further increases pitch angle on the retreating blade. As a result,  there is even more tilt to the rotor disk than at lower speeds.  

A horizontal lift component (thrust) generates higher  helicopter airspeed. The higher airspeed induces blade  flapping to maintain symmetry of lift. The combination of  flapping and cyclic feathering maintains symmetry of lift and  desired attitude on the rotor disk and helicopter.  

# Translational Lift  

Improved rotor efficiency resulting from directional flight is  called translational lift. The efficiency of the hovering rotor  disk is greatly improved with each knot of incoming wind  gained by horizontal movement of the aircraft or surface  wind. As the incoming wind produced by aircraft movement  

![](images/3967a1e52daddf24c922b33500edfc4a756fa7f27c99093cec805a9e48e1661b.jpg)  
Figure 2-38.  To compensate for blowback, you must move the  cyclic forward.  

or surface wind enters the rotor disk, turbulence and vortices  are left behind and the flow of air becomes more horizontal.  In addition, the tail rotor becomes more aerodynamically  efficient during the transition from hover to forward flight.  Figures 2-39  and  2-40  show the different airflow patterns  at different speeds and how airflow affects the efficiency of  the tail rotor.  

# Effective Translational Lift (ETL)  

While transitioning to forward flight at about 16 to 24 knots,  the helicopter goes through effective translational lift (ETL).  As mentioned earlier in the discussion on translational lift,  the rotor blades become more efficient as forward airspeed  increases. Between 16 and 24 knots, the rotor disk completely  outruns the recirculation of old vortices and begins to work  in relatively undisturbed air. The flow of air through the rotor  disk is more horizontal, which reduces induced flow and  drag with a corresponding increase in angle of attach and lift.  The additional lift available at this speed is referred to as the  ETL, which makes the rotor disk operate more efficiently.  This increased efficiency continues with increased airspeed  until the best climb airspeed is reached, and total drag is at  its lowest point.  

As speed increases, translational lift becomes more effective,  nose rises or pitches up, and aircraft rolls to the right.  The combined effects of dissymmetry of lift, gyroscopic  precession, and transverse flow effect cause this tendency.  It is important to understand these effects and anticipate  correcting for them. Once the helicopter is transitioning  through ETL, the pilot needs to apply forward and left  lateral cyclic input to maintain a constant rotor-disk attitude.  [Figure 2-41]  

# Translational Thrust  

Translational thrust occurs when the tail rotor becomes more  aerodynamically efficient during the transition from hover  to forward flight. As the tail rotor works in progressively  less turbulent air, this improved efficiency produces more  antitorque thrust, causing the nose of the aircraft to yaw left  

![](images/d79492429ccf2c163be00fa4a74395ff28eb943bb3d66060bd338c8047569904.jpg)

![](images/a9b068b0ca0391fb552a53d74d64bf58f864a713c019218040232cb583682f20.jpg)

(with a main rotor turning counterclockwise) and forces the  pilot to apply right pedal (decreasing the AOA in the tail  rotor blades) in response. In addition, during this period, the  airflow affects the horizontal components of the stabilizer  found on most helicopters which tends to bring the nose of  the helicopter to a more level attitude.  

# Induced Flow  

As the rotor blades rotate, they generate what is called  rotational relative wind. This airflow is characterized as  flowing parallel and opposite the rotor’s plane of rotation  and striking perpendicular to the rotor blade’s leading edge.  This rotational relative wind is used to generate lift. As  rotor blades produce lift, air is accelerated over the foil and  projected downward. Anytime a helicopter is producing lift,  it moves large masses of air vertically and down through the  rotor disk. This downwash or induced flow can significantly  change the efficiency of the rotor disk. Rotational relative  wind combines with induced flow to form the resultant  relative wind. As induced flow increases, resultant relative  wind becomes less horizontal. Since AOA is determined by measuring the difference between the chord line and the  resultant relative wind, as the resultant relative wind becomes  less horizontal, AOA decreases.  [See Figure 2-21]  

# Transverse Flow Effect  

As the helicopter accelerates in forward flight, induced flow  drops to near zero at the forward disk area and increases at the  aft disk area. These differences in lift between the fore and  aft portions of the rotor disk are called transverse flow effect.  [ Figure 2-41]  This increases the AOA at the front disk area  causing the rotor blade to flap up and reduces AOA at the aft  disk area causing the rotor blade to flap down. Because the  rotor acts like a gyro, maximum displacement occurs  $90^{\circ}$   in the  direction of rotation. The result is a tendency for the helicopter to  roll slightly to the right as it accelerates through approximately  20 knots or if the headwind is approximately 20 knots.  

Transverse flow effect is recognized by increased vibrations  of the helicopter at airspeeds around 12 to 15 knots and can  be produced by forward flight or from the wind while in a  hover. This vibration happens at an airspeed just below ETL  on takeoff and after passing through ETL during landing. The  vibration happens close to the same airspeed as ETL because  that is when the greatest lift differential exists between the  front and rear portions of the rotor system. As such, some  pilots confuse the vibration felt by transverse flow effect with  passing through ETL. To counteract transverse flow effect,  a cyclic input to the left may be needed.  

# Sideward Flight  

In sideward flight, the tip-path plane is tilted in the direction  that flight is desired. This tilts the total lift-thrust vector  sideward. In this case, the vertical or lift component is still  straight up and weight straight down, but the horizontal or  thrust component now acts sideward with drag acting to the  opposite side.  [Figure 2-42]  

Sideward flight can be a very unstable condition due to the  parasitic drag of the fuselage combined with the lack of  horizontal stabilizer for that direction of flight. Increased  altitudes help with control and the pilot must always scan in  the direction of flight. Movement of the cyclic in the intended  direction of flight causes the helicopter to move, controls the  rate of speed, and ground track, but the collective and pedals  are key to successful sideward flight. Just as in forward flight,  the collective keeps the helicopter from contacting the ground  and the pedals help maintain the correct heading; even in  sideward flight, the tail of the helicopter should remain behind  you. Inputs to the cyclic should be smooth and controlled,  and the pilot should always be aware of the tip-path plane in  relation to the ground.  [Figure 2-43]  

![](images/9ed3b14e4ed02d68744030e5917bcabb29fe2fdfc84631c66d080a4b1be03f89.jpg)  
Figure 2-42.  Forces acting on the helicopter during sideward flight.  

Contacting the ground with the skids during sideward flight  will most likely result in a dynamic rollover event before the  pilot has a chance to react. Extreme caution should be used  when maneuvering the helicopter sideways to avoid such  hazards from happening. Refer to Chapter 11, Helicopter  Hazards and Emergencies.  

# Rearward Flight  

For rearward flight, the tip-path plane is tilted rearward,  which, in turn, tilts the lift-thrust vector rearward. Drag now  acts forward with the lift component straight up and weight  straight down.  [Figure 2-44]  

Pilots must be aware of the hazards of rearward flight.  Because of the position of the horizontal stabilizer, the tail  end of the helicopter tends to pitch downward in rearward  flight, causing the probability of hitting the ground to be  greater than in forward flight. Another factor to consider  in rearward flight is skid design. Most helicopter skids are  not turned upward in the back, and any contact with the  ground during rearward flight can put the helicopter in an  uncontrollable position leading to tail rotor contact with the  ground. Pilots must do a thorough scan of the area before  attempting to hover rearward, looking for obstacles and  terrain changes. Slower airspeeds can help mitigate risk and  maintain a higher-than-normal hover altitude.  

# Turning Flight  

In forward flight, the rotor disk is tilted forward, which also  tilts the total lift-thrust force of the rotor disk forward. When  

![](images/d7acea534e0286813a013ff04e09312d2b13fc76012775662e0b2fb1656cfd40.jpg)

resulting in lift being separated into two components. Lift  acting upward and opposing weight is called the vertical  component of lift. Lift acting horizontally and opposing  inertia (centrifugal force) is the horizontal component of lift  (centripetal force).  [Figure 2-45]  

As the angle of bank increases, the total lift force is tilted more  toward the horizontal, thus causing the rate of turn to increase  because more lift is acting horizontally. Since the resultant  lifting force acts more horizontally, the effect of lift acting  

![](images/f0e7e60f2d8c64e5fd1895b1527b1c312da246f09840ed751f28facec00219f8.jpg)

the helicopter is banked, the rotor disk is tilted sideward

Figure 2-45.  Forces acting on the helicopter during turning flight.  

vertically is decreased. To compensate for this decreased  vertical lift, the AOA of the rotor blades must be increased in  order to maintain altitude. The steeper the angle of bank is,  the greater the AOA of the rotor blades required to maintain  altitude. Thus, with an increase in bank and a greater AOA, the  resultant lifting force increases, and the rate of turn is higher.  Simply put, collective pitch must be increased in order to  maintain altitude and airspeed while turning. Collective pitch  controls the angle of incidence and along with other factors,  determines the overall AOA in the rotor disk.  

# Autorotation  

Autorotation is the state of flight where the main rotor disk  of a helicopter is being turned by the action of air moving  up through the rotor rather than engine power driving  the rotor. In normal, powered flight, air is drawn into the  main rotor disk from above and exhausted downward, but  during autorotation, air moves up into the rotor disk from  below as the helicopter descends. Autorotation is permitted  mechanically by a freewheeling unit, which is a special  clutch mechanism that allows the main rotor to continue  turning even if the engine is not running. If the engine fails,  the freewheeling unit automatically disengages the engine  from the main rotor allowing the main rotor to rotate freely.  It is the means by which a helicopter can be landed safely in  the event of an engine failure; consequently, all helicopters  must demonstrate this capability in order to be certified.  [Figure 2-46]  If a decision is made to attempt an engine  restart in flight (the parameters for this emergency procedure  will be different for each helicopter and must be precisely  followed) the pilot must reengage the engine starter switch to  start the engine. Once the engine is started, the freewheeling  unit will reengage the engine with the main rotor.  

# Vertical Autorotation  

Most autorotations are performed with forward speed. For  simplicity, the following aerodynamic explanation is based  on a vertical autorotative descent (no forward speed) in still  air. Under these conditions, the forces that cause the blades  to turn are similar for all blades regardless of their position in  the plane of rotation. Therefore, dissymmetry of lift resulting  from helicopter airspeed is not a factor.  

During vertical autorotation, the rotor disk is divided into  three regions (as illustrated in  Figure 2-47) : driven region,  

![](images/1a60145b5548db88e8d9d9a597cf32ccbaa8630aca1be9c89ea05f07f7b26e88.jpg)  
Figure 2-46.  During an autorotation, the upward flow of relative wind permits the main rotor blades to rotate at their normal speed. In  effect, the blades are “gliding” in their rotational plane.  

![](images/38b037a4ce2e2582483566e0d312324b999440dca63d3749371007f41dc24715.jpg)  
Figure 2-47.  Blade regions during autorotational descent.  

driving region, and stall region.  Figure 2-48  shows three  blade sections that illustrate force vectors. Part A is the  driven region, B and D are points of equilibrium, part C is  the driving region, and part E is the stall region. Force vectors  are different in each region because rotational relative wind is  slower near the blade root and increases continually toward  the blade tip. Also, blade twist gives a more positive AOA in  the driving region than in the driven region. The combination  of the inflow up through the rotor with rotational relative  wind produces different combinations of aerodynamic force  at every point along the blade.  

The driven region, also called the propeller region, is nearest  the blade tips. Normally, it consists of about 30 percent of  the radius. In the driven region, part A of  Figure 2-48,  the  TAF acts behind the axis of rotation, resulting in an overall  drag force. The driven region produces some lift, but that lift  is offset by drag. The overall result is a deceleration in the  rotation of the blade. The size of this region varies with the  blade pitch, rate of descent, and rotor rpm. When changing  autorotative rpm blade pitch, or rate of descent, the size of  the driven region in relation to the other regions also changes.  

There are two points of equilibrium on the blade—one  between the driven region and the driving region, and one  between the driving region and the stall region. At points of  equilibrium, TAF is aligned with the axis of rotation. Lift  and drag are produced, but the total effect produces neither  acceleration nor deceleration.  

The driving region, or autorotative region, normally lies  between 25 to 70 percent of the blade radius. Part C of  Figure 2-48  shows the driving region of the blade, which  produces the forces needed to turn the blades during  autorotation. Total aerodynamic force in the driving region is  inclined slightly forward of the axis of rotation, producing a  continual acceleration force. This inclination supplies thrust,  which tends to accelerate the rotation of the blade. Driving  region size varies with blade pitch setting, rate of descent,  and rotor rpm.  

By controlling the size of this region, a pilot can adjust  autorotative rpm. For example, if the collective pitch is raised,  the pitch angle increases in all regions. This causes the point  of equilibrium to move inboard along the blade’s span, thus  increasing the size of the driven region. The stall region also  becomes larger while the driving region becomes smaller.  Reducing the size of the driving region causes the acceleration  force of the driving region and rpm to decrease. A constant  rotor rpm is achieved by adjusting the collective pitch so blade  acceleration forces from the driving region are balanced with  the deceleration forces from the driven and stall regions.  

The inner 25 percent of the rotor blade is referred to as the  stall region and operates above its maximum AOA (stall  angle), causing drag, which tends to slow rotation of the  blade. Part E of  Figure 2-48  depicts the stall region.  

# Autorotation (Forward Flight)  

Autorotative force in forward flight is produced in exactly the  same manner as when the helicopter is descending vertically  in still air. However, because forward speed changes the  inflow of air up through the rotor disk, all three regions move  outboard along the blade span on the retreating side of the  disk where AOA is larger.  [Figure 2-49]  With lower AOA  on the advancing side blade, more of the blade falls in the  driven region. On the retreating side, more of the blade is in  the stall region. A small section near the root experiences a  reversed flow; therefore, the size of the driven region on the  retreating side is reduced.  

Prior to landing from an autorotative descent (or autorotation),  the pilot must flare the helicopter in order to decelerate. The  pilot initiates the flare by applying aft cyclic. As the helicopter  flares back, the airflow patterns change around the blades  causing the rpm to increase. Pilots must adjust the collective  as necessary to keep the rpm within operating limits.

# Chapter 3 Helicopter Flight Controls  

# Introduction  

There are three major controls in a helicopter that the pilot  must use during flight. They are the collective pitch control,  the cyclic pitch control, and the antitorque pedals or tail rotor  control. In addition to these major controls, the pilot must also  use the throttle control, which is usually mounted directly  to the collective pitch control in order to fly the helicopter.  

In this chapter, the control systems described are not limited  to the single main rotor type helicopter but are employed  in one form or another in most helicopter configurations.  All examples in this chapter refer to a counterclockwise  main rotor blade rotation as viewed from above. If flying a  helicopter with a clockwise rotation, left and right references  must be reversed, particularly in the areas of rotor blade pitch  change, antitorque pedal movement, and tail rotor thrust.  

# Collective Pitch Control  

The collective pitch control (or simply “collective” or “thrust  lever”) is located on the left side of the pilot’s seat and is  operated with the left hand. The collective is used to make  changes to the pitch angle of the main rotor blades and does  this simultaneously, or collectively, as the name implies. As  the collective pitch control is raised, there is a simultaneous  and equal increase in pitch angle of all main rotor blades;  as it is lowered, there is a simultaneous and equal decrease  in pitch angle. This is done through a series of mechanical  linkages and the amount of movement in the collective lever  determines the amount of blade pitch change.  [Figure 3-1]   An adjustable friction control helps prevent inadvertent  collective pitch movement.  

Changing the pitch angle on the blades changes the angle  of incidence on each blade. With a change in angle of  incidence comes a change in drag, which affects the speed  or revolutions per minute (rpm) of the main rotor. As the  pitch angle increases, angle of incidence increases, drag  increases, and rotor rpm decreases. Decreasing pitch angle  decreases both angle of incidence and drag, while rotor rpm  increases. In order to maintain a constant rotor rpm, which  is essential in helicopter operations, a proportionate change  in power is required to compensate for the change in drag.  This is accomplished with the throttle control or governor,  which automatically adjusts engine power.  

# Throttle Control  

The function of the throttle is to regulate engine rpm. If  the correlator or governor system does not maintain the  desired rpm when the collective is raised or lowered, or if  those systems are not installed, the throttle must be moved  manually with the twist grip in order to maintain rpm. In  most helicopters, rotating the twist-grip throttle away from  the pilot (counter-clockwise), increases engine rpm; rotating  the twist-grip throttle towards the pilot (clockwise) decreases  engine rpm. [Figure 3-2]  

# Governor/Correlator  

A governor is a sensing device that senses rotor and engine  rpm and makes the necessary adjustments in order to keep  rotor rpm constant. In normal operations, once the rotor  rpm is set, the governor keeps the rpm constant, and there  is no need to make any throttle adjustments. Governors are  common on all turbine helicopters (as it is a function of the  fuel control system of the turbine engine) and used on some  piston powered helicopters.  

A correlator is a mechanical connection between the  collective lever and the engine throttle. When the collective  lever is raised, power is automatically increased; when  lowered, power is decreased. This system maintains rpm  close to the desired value, but still requires adjustment of  the throttle for fine tuning.

Figure 3-1.  Raising the collective pitch control increases the pitch angle, or angle of incidence, by the same amount on all blades.  

![](images/9e07b11d680befcaf8af2c57570ad77268e3e562e720efda91545445fbd7e553.jpg)  
Figure 3-2.  A twist grip throttle is usually mounted on the end of  the collective lever. The throttles on some turbine helicopters are  mounted on the overhead panel or on the floor in the cockpit.  

Some helicopters do not have correlators or governors and  require coordination of all collective and throttle movements.  When the collective is raised, the throttle must be increased;  when the collective is lowered, the throttle must be decreased.  As with any aircraft control, large adjustments of either  collective pitch or throttle should be avoided. All corrections  should be made through the use of smooth pressure.  

In piston helicopters, the collective pitch is the primary control  for manifold pressure, and the throttle is the primary control  for rpm. However, the collective pitch control also influences  rpm, and the throttle also influences manifold pressure;  therefore, each is considered to be a secondary control of the  other’s function. Both the tachometer (rpm indicator) and  the manifold pressure gauge must be analyzed to determine  which control to use.  Figure 3-3  illustrates this relationship.

Figure 3-3.  Relationship between rpm, manifold pressure, collective,  and throttle.  

# Cyclic Pitch Control  

The cyclic pitch control (or simply “cyclic”) is usually  projected upward from the cockpit floor, between the  pilot’s legs or between the two pilot seats in some models.  [Figure 3-4]  This primary flight control allows the pilot to fly  the helicopter in any direction of travel: forward, rearward,  left, and right. As discussed in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics  of Flight, the total lift force is always perpendicular to the  tip-path plane of the main rotor. The purpose of the cyclic  pitch control is to tilt the tip-path plane in the direction of  the desired horizontal direction. The cyclic controls the  rotor disk tilt versus the horizon, which directs the rotor disk  thrust to enable the pilot to control the direction of travel of  the helicopter.  

The rotor disk tilts in the same direction the cyclic pitch control  is moved. If the cyclic is moved forward, the rotor disk tilts  forward; if the cyclic is moved aft, the disk tilts aft, and so on.  Because the rotor disk acts like a gyro, the mechanical linkages  for the cyclic control rods are rigged in such a way that they  

![](images/959a90a0dbd80331ffddc575480225d50e2a74a1bccae2a9c8fb72e7bae5f261.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.  The cyclic pitch control may be mounted vertically  between the pilot’s knees or on a teetering bar from a single cyclic  located in the center of the helicopter. The cyclic can pivot in all  directions.  

decrease the pitch angle of the rotor blade approximately   $90^{\circ}$   before it reaches the direction of cyclic displacement  and increase the pitch angle of the rotor blade approximately   $90°$   after it passes the direction of displacement. An increase  in pitch angle increases AOA; a decrease in pitch angle  decreases AOA. For example, if the cyclic is moved forward,  the AOA decreases as the rotor blade passes the right side of  the helicopter and increases on the left side. This results in  maximum downward deflection of the rotor blade in front  of the helicopter and maximum upward deflection behind it,  causing the rotor disk to tilt forward.  

# Antitorque Pedals  

The antitorque pedals, located on the cabin floor by the pilot’s  feet, control the pitch and therefore the thrust of the tail rotor  blades or other antitorque system. See Chapter 5, Helicopter  Components, Sections, and Systems, for a discussion on  these other systems.  [Figure 3-5]  Newton’s Third Law was  discussed in Chapter 2, General Aerodynamics, stating that  for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  This law applies to the helicopter fuselage and its rotation  in the opposite direction of the main rotor blades unless  counteracted and controlled. To make flight possible and  to compensate for this torque, most helicopter designs  incorporate an antitorque rotor or tail rotor. The antitorque  pedals allow the pilot to control the pitch angle of the tail  rotor blades, which in forward flight puts the helicopter in  longitudinal trim and, while at a hover, enables the pilot to  turn the helicopter  $360^{\circ}$  . The antitorque pedals are connected  to the pitch change mechanism on the tail rotor gearbox and  allow the pitch angle on the tail rotor blades to be increased  or decreased.  

![](images/da8688884904dd9db4650cbc2a6328dbc2d7c3467109bf7550aaf034b547b6fd.jpg)  
Figure 3-5.  Antitorque pedals compensate for changes in torque  and control heading in a hover.  

# Heading Control  

The tail rotor is used to control the heading of the helicopter  while hovering or when making hovering turns, as well as  counteracting the torque of the main rotor. Hovering turns  are commonly referred to as “pedal turns.”  

At speeds above translational lift, the pedals are used to  compensate for torque to put the helicopter in longitudinal  trim, so that coordinated flight can be maintained. The cyclic  control is used to change heading by making a turn to the  desired direction.  

The thrust of the tail rotor depends on the pitch angle of the  tail rotor blades. This pitch angle can be positive, negative,  or zero. A positive pitch angle tends to move the tail to the  right. A negative pitch angle moves the tail to the left, while  no thrust is produced with a zero pitch angle. The maximum  positive pitch angle of the tail rotor is generally greater than  the maximum negative pitch angle available. This is because  the primary purpose of the tail rotor is to counteract the torque  of the main rotor. The capability for tail rotors to produce  thrust to the left (negative pitch angle) is necessary, because  during autorotation the drag of the transmission tends to yaw  the nose to the left, or in the same direction the main rotor  is turning.  

From the neutral position, applying right pedal causes the  nose of the helicopter to yaw right and the tail to swing to  the left. Pressing on the left pedal has the opposite effect:  the nose of the helicopter yaws to the left and the tail swings  right.  [Figure 3-6]  

With the antitorque pedals in the neutral position, the tail rotor  has a medium positive pitch angle. In medium positive pitch,  the tail rotor thrust approximately equals the torque of the  main rotor during cruise flight, so the helicopter maintains  a constant heading in level flight.  

A vertical fin or stabilizer is used in many single-rotor  helicopters to help aid in heading control. The fin is designed  to optimize directional stability in flight with a zero tail rotor  thrust setting. The size of the fin is crucial to this design. If  the surface is too large, the tail rotor thrust may be blocked.  Heading control would be more difficult at slower airspeeds  and at a hover and the vertical fin would then weathervane.  

Helicopters that are designed with tandem rotors do not have  an antitorque rotor. The helicopter is designed with both  rotor systems rotating in opposite directions to counteract the  torque rather than a tail rotor. Directional antitorque pedals  

![](images/0352e5561ea87c80046fd45e3f585c05d0c42bad1bb64c3c161f70615f42253e.jpg)  
Figure 3-6.  Tail rotor pitch angle and thrust in relation to pedal positions during cruising flight.  

are used for directional control of the aircraft while in flight,  as well as while taxiing with the forward gear off the ground.  

In intermeshing rotor systems, which are a set of two rotors  turning in opposite directions with each rotor mast mounted  on the helicopter with a slight angle to the other so that  the blades intermesh without colliding, and a coaxial rotor  systems, which are a pair of rotors mounted one above the  other on the same shaft and turning in opposite directions, the  heading pedals control the heading of the helicopter while at  a hover by imbalancing torque between the rotors, allowing  for the torque to turn the helicopter.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter introduced the pilot to the major flight controls  and how they work in relation to each other. The chapter also  correlates the use of flight controls and aerodynamics and  how the two work together to make flight possible.  

# Chapter 4 Helicopter Components,  Sections, and Systems  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses the components, sections, and systems  found on most modern helicopters. Helicopters come in a  variety of sizes and shapes, but most share the same major  components. The chapter introduces the major components/ sections of the helicopter and the systems that correlate  with each. Knowing how the components and systems  work on the helicopter enables the pilot to more easily  recognize malfunctions and possible emergency situations.  Understanding the relationship of these systems allows the  pilot to make an informed decision and take the appropriate  corrective action should a problem arise.  

# Airframe  

The airframe, or fundamental structure, of a helicopter can be  made of either metal, wood, or composite materials, or some  combination of the two. Typically, a composite component  consists of many layers of fiber-impregnated resins, bonded  to form a smooth panel. Tubular and sheet metal substructures  are usually made of aluminum, though stainless steel or  titanium are sometimes used in areas subject to higher  stress or heat. Airframe design encompasses engineering,  aerodynamics, materials technology, and manufacturing  methods to achieve favorable balances of performance,  reliability, and cost.  [Figure 4-1]  

# Fuselage  

The fuselage, the outer core of the airframe, is an aircraft’s  main body section that houses the cabin that holds the crew,  passengers, and cargo. Helicopter cabins have a variety of  seating arrangements. Most have the pilot seated on the right  side, although there are some with the pilot seated on the  left side or center. The fuselage also houses the engine, the  transmission, avionics, flight controls, and the powerplant.  [Figure 4-1]  

# Main Rotor System  

The rotor system is the rotating part of a helicopter which  generates lift. The rotor consists of a mast, hub, and rotor  blades. The mast is a hollow cylindrical metal shaft which  extends upwards from and is driven and sometimes supported  by the transmission. At the top of the mast is the attachment  point for the rotor blades called the hub. The rotor blades are  then attached to the hub by any number of different methods.  Main rotor systems are classified according to how the main  rotor blades are attached and move relative to the main rotor  hub. There are three basic classifications: semirigid, rigid,  or fully articulated. Some modern rotor systems, such as the  bearingless rotor system, use an engineered combination of  these types.  

# Semirigid Rotor System  

A semirigid rotor system is usually composed of two blades  that are rigidly mounted to the main rotor hub. The main rotor  hub is free to tilt with respect to the main rotor shaft on what  is known as a teetering or flapping hinge. This allows the  blades to flap together as a unit. As one blade flaps up, the  other flaps down. Since there is no vertical drag hinge, lead/ lag forces are absorbed and mitigated by blade bending. The  semirigid rotor is also capable of feathering, which means that  the pitch angle of the blade changes. This is made possible  by the feathering hinge.  [Figure 4-2]  

If the semirigid rotor system is an underslung rotor, the center  of gravity (CG) is below where it is attached to the mast. This  underslung mounting is designed to align the blade’s center  of mass with a common flapping hinge so that both blades’  centers of mass vary equally in distance from the center of  rotation during flapping. The rotational speed of the system tends to change, but this is restrained by the inertia of the  engine and flexibility of the drive system. Only a moderate  amount of stiffening at the blade root is necessary to handle  this restriction. Simply put, underslinging effectively  eliminates geometric imbalance.  [Figure 4-3]  

![](images/63be351ef784d639fcee9832a8d0b00dda14d6cfde5c83e0cb8e4906e9f226dd.jpg)  
Figure 4-1.  The major components of a helicopter are the airframe, fuselage, landing gear, powerplant, transmission, main rotor  system,and tail rotor system.

Figure 4-2.  The teetering hinge allows the main rotor hub to tilt, and  the feathering hinge enables the pitch angle of the blades to change.  

The underslung rotor system mitigates the lead/lag forces by  mounting the blades slightly lower than the usual plane of  rotation, so the lead/lag forces are minimized. As the blades  cone upward, the center of pressures of the blades are almost  in the same plane as the hub. Whatever stresses are remaining  bend the blades for compliance.  

Helicopters with semirigid rotors are vulnerable to a  condition known as mast bumping which can cause the rotor  flap stops to shear the mast. The mechanical design of the  semirigid rotor system dictates downward flapping of the  blades must have some physical limit. Mast bumping is the  result of excessive rotor flapping. Each rotor system design  has a maximum flapping angle. If flapping exceeds the design  value, the static stop will contact the mast. The static stop is  a component of the main rotor providing limited movement  of strap fittings and a contoured surface between the mast  and hub. It is the violent contact between the static stop and  the mast during flight that causes mast damage or separation.  This contact must be avoided at all costs.  

Mast bumping is directly related to how much the blade  system flaps. In straight and level flight, blade flapping is  minimal, perhaps  $2^{\circ}$   under usual flight conditions. Flapping  angles increase slightly with high forward speeds, at low  rotor rpm, at high-density altitudes, at high gross weights, and  when encountering turbulence. Maneuvering the aircraft in a  sideslip or during low-speed flight at extreme CG positions  can induce larger flapping angles.  

# Rigid Rotor System  

The rigid rotor system shown in  Figure 4-4  is mechanically  simple, but structurally complex because operating loads  must be absorbed in bending rather than through hinges. In  this system, the blade roots are rigidly attached to the rotor  hub. Rigid rotor systems tend to behave like fully articulated  systems through aerodynamics, but lack flapping or lead/ lag hinges. Instead, the blades accommodate these motions  by bending. They cannot flap or lead/lag, but they can be  feathered. As advancements in helicopter aerodynamics

Figure 4-3.  With an underslung rotor, the center of gravity   $(C G)$   remains in the same approximate location relative to the mast before  and after rotor tilt.

Figure 4-4.  Four-blade hingeless (rigid) main rotor. Rotor blades are comprised of glass fiber reinforced material. The hub is a single  piece of forged rigid titanium.  

and materials continue to improve, rigid rotor systems may  become more common because the system is fundamentally  easier to design and offers the best properties of both  semirigid and fully articulated systems.  

The rigid rotor system is very responsive and is usually  not susceptible to mast bumping like the semirigid systems  because the rotor hubs are mounted solid to the main rotor  mast. This allows the rotor and fuselage to move together  as one entity and eliminates much of the oscillation usually  present in the other rotor systems. Other advantages of the rigid  rotor include a reduction in the weight and drag of the rotor  hub and a larger flapping arm, which significantly reduces  control inputs. Without the complex hinges, the rotor system  becomes much more reliable and easier to maintain than the  other rotor configurations. A disadvantage of this system is  the quality of ride in turbulent or gusty air. Because there are  no hinges to help absorb the larger loads, vibrations are felt  in the cabin much more than with other rotor head designs.  

There are several variations of the basic three rotor head  designs. The bearingless rotor system is closely related to  the articulated rotor system but has no bearings or hinges.  This design relies on the structure of blades and hub to absorb  stresses. The main difference between the rigid rotor system  and the bearingless system is that the bearingless system has  no feathering bearing—the material inside the cuff is twisted  by the action of the pitch change arm. Nearly all bearingless  rotor hubs are made of fiber-composite materials. The  differences in handling between the types of rotor system  are summarized in  Figure 4-5 .  

# Fully Articulated Rotor System  

Fully articulated rotor systems allow each blade to lead/lag  (move back and forth in plane), flap (move up and down  about an inboard mounted hinge) independent of the other  blades, and feather (rotate about the pitch axis to change lift).  [Figures 4-6  and  4-7]  Each of these blade motions is related  

![Figure 4-5.  Differences in handling between the types of rotor  systems.  ](images/6db0da37668136cac2108c174694ec000800c065a2db5965bfae543a52a5b6b3.jpg)

to the others. Fully articulated rotor systems are found on  helicopters with more than two main rotor blades.  

As the rotor spins, each blade responds to inputs from the  control system to enable aircraft control. The center of lift  on the whole rotor system moves in response to these inputs  to effect pitch, roll, and upward motion. The magnitude of  this lift force is based on the collective input, which changes  pitch on all blades in the same direction at the same time. The  location of this lift force is based on the pitch and roll inputs  from the pilot. Therefore, the feathering angle of each blade  (proportional to its own lifting force) changes as it rotates  with the rotor, hence the name “cyclic control.”  

As the lift on a given blade increases, it tends to flap upwards.  The flapping hinge for the blade permits this motion and is  balanced by the centrifugal force of the weight of the blade,  which tries to keep it in the horizontal plane.  [Figure 4-8]  

Either way, some motion must be accommodated. The  centrifugal force is nominally constant; however, the flapping  force is affected by the severity of the maneuver (rate of  climb, forward speed, aircraft gross weight). As the blade  flaps, its CG changes. This changes the local moment of  inertia of the blade with respect to the rotor system and it  speeds up or slows down with respect to the rest of the blades  and the whole rotor system. This is accommodated by the  lead/lag or drag hinge, shown in  Figure 4-9,  and is easier to  visualize with the classical ‘ice skater doing a spin’ image.  As the skater moves her arms in, she spins faster because her inertia changes but her total energy remains constant (neglect  friction for purposes of this explanation). Conversely, as  her arms extend, her spin slows. This is also known as the  conservation of angular momentum. An in-plane damper  typically moderates lead/lag motion.  

Following a single blade through a single rotation beginning  at some neutral position, as load increases from increased  feathering, it flaps up and leads forward. As it continues  

![](images/ff20e5ecc861b495e82d77b723c74776a8e3d15d6773031f9dae2845ae2e6c77.jpg)

around, it flaps down and lags backward. At the lowest  point of load, it is at its lowest flap angle and also at its most  ‘rearward’ lag position. Because the rotor is a large, rotating  mass, it behaves somewhat like a gyroscope. The effect of  this is that a control input is usually realized on the attached  body at a position  $90^{\circ}$   prior to the control input displacement  in the axis of rotation. This is accounted for by the designers  through placement of the control input to the rotor system  so that a forward input of the cyclic control stick results in a  nominally forward motion of the aircraft. The effect is made  transparent to the pilot.  

Older hinge designs relied on conventional metal bearings. By  basic geometry, this precludes a coincident flapping and lead/ lag hinge and is cause for recurring maintenance. Newer rotor  systems use elastomeric bearings, arrangements of rubber  and steel that can permit motion in two axes. Besides solving  some of the above-mentioned kinematic issues, these bearings  are usually in compression, can be readily inspected, and  eliminate the maintenance associated with metallic bearings.  

Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe, and their wear  is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older  bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design.  

# Tandem Rotor  

Tandem rotor (sometimes referred to as dual rotor)  helicopters have two large horizontal rotor assemblies; a twin  rotor system, instead of one main assembly, and a smaller  tail rotor.  [Figure 4-10]  Single rotor helicopters need an  anti-torque system to neutralize the twisting momentum  produced by the single large rotor. Tandem rotor helicopters,  however, use counter-rotating rotors, with each canceling  

![](images/620733e6d4ef3de15f107d3bbc860510ffa2a4923668744708171b43cb1b8936.jpg)  
Figure 4-10.  Tandem rotor heads.  

out the other’s torque. Counter-rotating rotor blades will not  collide with and destroy each other if they flex into the other  rotor’s pathway. This configuration also has the advantage  of being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since  there are two sets. Also, all of the power from the engines can  be used for lift, whereas a single rotor helicopter uses power  to counter the torque.  

# Coaxial Rotors  

A coaxial rotor system is a pair of rotors mounted on the same  shaft but turning in opposite directions. This design eliminates  the need for a tail rotor or other antitorque mechanisms, and  since the blades turn in opposite directions, the effects of  dissymmetry of lift are avoided. The main disadvantage  of coaxial rotors is the increased mechanical complexity  of the rotor system. Numerous Russian helicopters, such  as the Kaman Ka-31 and Ka-50, along with the Sikorsky  experimental X2 use a coaxial rotor design.  

# Intermeshing Rotors  

An intermeshing rotor system is a set of two rotors turning  in the opposite directions with each rotor mast mounted on  the helicopter with a slight angle, so the blades intermesh  without colliding. This design also eliminates the need for an  antitorque system, which provides more engine power for lift.  However, neither rotor lifts directly vertical which reduces  each rotor’s efficiency. The Kaman HH-43, which was used  by the USAF in a firefighting role and the Kaman K-MAX  are examples of an intermeshing rotor systems.  

# Swash Plate Assembly  

The purpose of the swash plate is to convert stationary  control inputs from the pilot into rotating inputs which can be  connected to the rotor blades or control surfaces. It consists  of two main parts: stationary swash plate and rotating swash  plate . [Figure 4-11]  

![](images/e65db03020f908ae9b36e3e75a0223dae8afb311087311c91dff3a21d8ecc47b.jpg)  
Figure 4-11.  Stationary and rotating swash plate.  

The stationary swash plate is mounted around the main rotor  mast and connected to the cyclic and collective controls by a  series of pushrods. It is restrained from rotating by an anti- drive link but can tilt in all directions and move vertically.  The rotating swash plate is mounted to the stationary swash  plate by means of a uniball sleeve. It is connected to the mast  by drive links and must rotate in constant relationship with  the main rotor mast. Both swash plates tilt and slide up and  down as one unit. The rotating swash plate is connected to  the pitch horns by the pitch links.  

# Freewheeling Unit  

Since lift in a helicopter is provided by rotating airfoils,  these airfoils must be free to rotate if the engine fails. The  freewheeling unit automatically disengages the engine from  the main rotor when engine revolutions per minute (rpm)  is less than main rotor rpm.  [Figure 4-12]  This allows the  main rotor and tail rotor to continue turning at normal in- flight speeds. The most common freewheeling unit assembly  consists of a one-way sprag clutch located between the engine  and main rotor transmission. This is usually in the upper  pulley in a piston helicopter or mounted on the accessory  gearbox in a turbine helicopter. When the engine is driving  the rotor, inclined surfaces in the sprag clutch force rollers  against an outer drum. This prevents the engine from  exceeding transmission rpm. If the engine fails, the rollers  move inward, allowing the outer drum to exceed the speed  of the inner portion. The transmission can then exceed the  speed of the engine. In this condition, engine speed is less  than that of the drive system, and the helicopter is in an  autorotative state.  

# Antitorque System  

Helicopters with a single, main rotor system require a  separate antitorque system. This is most often accomplished  through a variable pitch, antitorque rotor or tail rotor.  [Figure 4-13]  Pilots vary the thrust of the antitorque system to  maintain directional control whenever the main rotor torque

Figure 4-12.  Freewheeling unit in normal drive position and  freewheeling position. Note that in the top example, the engine  output shaft (inner part) drives the rotor shaft (outer part) at the  same speed (normal flight). In the bottom example, the rotor shaft  (outer part) breaks free under autorotation, as it turns faster than  the driver shaft (inner part).

changes, or to make heading changes while hovering. Most  helicopters drive the tail rotor shaft from the transmission  to ensure tail rotor rotation (and hence control) in the event  that the engine quits. Usually, negative antitorque thrust is  needed in autorotations to overcome transmission friction.  

# Fenestron  

Another form of antitorque system is the Fenestron or “fan- in-tail” design. This system uses a series of rotating blades  shrouded within a vertical tail. Because the blades are located  within a circular duct, they are less likely to come into contact  with people or objects.  [Figure 4-14]  

# NOTAR ®  

Using the natural characteristics of helicopter aerodynamics,  the NOTAR ®  antitorque system provides safe, quiet,  responsive, foreign object damage (FOD) resistant directional  control. The enclosed variable-pitch composite blade fan  produces a low pressure, high volume of ambient air to  pressurize the composite tailboom. The air is expelled  through two slots which run the length of the tailboom on the  right side, causing a boundary-layer control called the Coanda  effect. The result is that the tailboom becomes a “wing,”  flying in the downwash of the rotor system, producing up to  60 percent of the antitorque required in a hover. The balance  of the directional control is accomplished by a rotating direct  jet thruster. In forward flight, the vertical stabilizers provide  the majority of the antitorque; however, directional control  remains a function of the direct jet thruster. The NOTAR ® antitorque system eliminates some of the mechanical  disadvantages of a tail rotor, including long drive shafts,  hanger bearings, intermediate gearboxes and  $90^{\circ}$   gearboxes.  [Figure 4-15]  

# Antitorque Drive Systems  

The antitorque drive system consists of an antitorque drive  shaft and a antitorque gearbox mounted at the end of the tail  boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a  series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible  couplings. This allows the drive shaft to flex with the tail  boom. The tail rotor gearbox provides a right-angle drive  for the tail rotor and may also include gearing to adjust the

output to optimum tail rotor rpm.  [Figure 4-16]  Tail rotors  may also have an intermediate gearbox to turn the power up  a pylon or vertical fin.  

# Engines  

# Reciprocating Engines  

Reciprocating engines, also called piston engines, are  generally used in smaller helicopters. Most training  helicopters use reciprocating engines because they are  relatively simple and inexpensive to operate. Refer to the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for a detailed  explanation and illustrations of the piston engine.  

# Turbine Engines  

Turbine engines are more powerful and are used in a wide  variety of helicopters. They produce a tremendous amount  of power for their size but are generally more expensive  to operate. The turbine engine used in helicopters operates  differently from those used in airplane applications. In most  applications, the exhaust outlets simply release expended  gases and do not contribute to the forward motion of the  helicopter. Approximately 75 percent of the incoming airflow  is used to cool the engine.  

The gas turbine engine mounted on most helicopters is  made up of a compressor, combustion chamber, turbine,  and accessory gearbox assembly. The compressor draws  filtered air into the plenum chamber and compresses it.  Common type filters are centrifugal swirl tubes where debris  is ejected outward and blown overboard prior to entering  the compressor, or engine barrier filters (EBF), similar to  the K&N filter element used in automotive applications.  

![](images/b9b1b28289cfe0e2d26a2ba3ed2e8c5e3694c6d086fc2772803565118522cc94.jpg)  
Figure 4-15.  While in a hover, Coanda effect supplies approximately  two-thirds of the lift necessary to maintain directional control.  The rest is created by directing the thrust from the controllable  rotating nozzle.  

![](images/76fabe52296f0db83f92c7b7d7ff1ed2db2112a6d0bae7c00ca44ed9d234f39b.jpg)  
Figure 4-16.  The tail rotor driveshaft is connected to both the main transmission and the tail rotor transmission.  

Although this design significantly reduces the ingestion  of foreign objects into the engine, it is important for pilots  to be aware of how much debris is actually being filtered.  Operating in the sand, dust, or even in grassy type materials  can choke an engine in just minutes. The compressed air is  directed to the combustion section through discharge tubes  where atomized fuel is injected into it. The fuel/air mixture  is ignited and allowed to expand. This combustion gas is then  forced through a series of turbine wheels causing them to  turn. These turbine wheels provide power to both the engine  compressor and the accessory gearbox. Depending on model  and manufacturer, the rpm can vary from 20,000 to 51,600.  

Power is provided to the main rotor and tail rotor systems  through the freewheeling unit which is attached to the  accessory gearbox power output gear shaft. The combustion  gas is finally expelled through an exhaust outlet. The  temperature of gas is measured at different locations and is  referenced differently by each manufacturer. Some common  terms are inter-turbine temperature (ITT), exhaust gas  temperature (EGT), measured gas temperature (MGT), or  turbine outlet temperature (TOT). TOT is used throughout  this discussion for simplicity.  [Figure 4-17]  

![](images/ddc9c86335a8fe3e169f7473fff3c11cba6d984bf1cecf70724b8229d4f8d52d.jpg)  
Figure 4-17.  Many helicopters use a turboshaft engine as shown above to drive the main transmission and rotor systems. The main  difference between a turboshaft and a turbojet engine is that most of the energy produced by the expanding gases is used to drive a  turbine rather than producing thrust through the expulsion of exhaust gases.  

# Compressor  

The compressor may consist of an axial compressor, a  centrifugal compressor, or combination of the two.  

An axial compressor consists of two main elements: the rotor  and the stator. The rotor consists of a number of blades fixed  on a rotating spindle and resembles a fan. As the rotor turns,  air is   drawn inward. Stator vanes are arranged in fixed rows  between the rotor blades and act as a diffuser at each stage  to decrease air velocity and increase air pressure. There may  be a number of rows of rotor blades and stator vanes. Each  row constitutes a pressure stage, and the number of stages  depends on the amount of air and pressure rise required for  the particular engine.  

A centrifugal compressor consists of an impeller, diffuser,  and a manifold. The impeller, which is a forged disc with  integral blades, rotates at a high speed to draw air in and  expel it at an accelerated rate. The air then passes through  the diffuser, which slows the air down. When the velocity  of the air is slowed, static pressure increases, resulting  in compressed, high pressure air. The high-pressure air  then passes through the compressor manifold where it is  distributed to the combustion chamber via discharge tubes.  

If the airflow through the compressor is disturbed, a  condition called surge, or compressor stall, may take effect.  This phenomenon is a periodic stalling of the compressor  blades. When this occurs, the pressure at the compressor  is reduced and the combustion pressure may cause reverse  flow into the compressor output. As the airflow through  the compressor is reduced, the air pressure then increases  temporarily correcting the condition until it occurs again.  This is felt throughout the airframe as vibrations and is  accompanied by power loss and an increase in TOT as the  fuel control adds fuel in an attempt to maintain power. This  condition may be corrected by activating the bleed air system  which vents excess pressure to the atmosphere and allows  a larger volume of air to enter the compressor to unstall the  compressor blades.  

# Combustion Chamber  

Unlike a piston engine, the combustion in a turbine engine is  continuous. An igniter plug serves only to ignite the fuel/air  mixture when starting the engine. Once the fuel/air mixture  is ignited, it continues to burn as long as the fuel/air mixture  continues to be present. If there is an interruption of fuel, air,  or both, combustion ceases. This is known as a “flameout,”  and the engine must be restarted or re-lit. Some helicopters  are equipped with auto-relight, which automatically activates  the igniters to start combustion if the engine flames out.  

# Turbine  

The two-stage turbine section consists of a series of turbine  wheels that are used to drive the compressor section and  other components attached to the accessory gearbox. Both  stages may consist of one or more turbine wheels. The first  stage is usually referred to as the gas producer (N1 or NG)  while the second stage is commonly called the power turbine  (N2 or NP). (The letter N is used to denote rotational speed.)  

If the first and second stage turbines are mechanically  coupled to each other, the system is said to be a fixed turbine  (turboshaft). These engines share a common shaft, which  means the first and second stage turbines, and thus the  compressor and output shaft, are connected.  

On most turbine assemblies used in helicopters, the first  stage and second stage turbines are not mechanically  connected to each other. Rather, they are mounted on  independent shafts, one inside the other, and can turn  freely with respect to each other. This is referred to as a  “free turbine.” When a free turbine engine is running, the  combustion gases pass through the first stage turbine (N1)  to drive the compressor and other components, and then past  the independent second stage turbine (N2), which turns the  power and accessory gearbox to drive the output shaft, as  well as other miscellaneous components.  

# Accessory Gearbox  

The accessory gearbox of the engine houses all of the  necessary gears to drive the numerous components of the  helicopter. Power is provided to the accessory gearbox  through the independent shafts connected to the N1 and  N2 turbine wheels. The N1 stage drives the components  necessary to complete the turbine cycle, making the engine  self-sustaining. Common components driven by the N1  stage are the compressor, oil pump, fuel pump, and starter/ generator. The N2 stage is dedicated to driving the main  rotor and tail rotor drive systems and other accessories such  as generators, alternators, and air conditioning.  

# Transmission System  

The transmission system transfers power from the engine to  the main rotor, tail rotor, and other accessories during normal  flight conditions. The main components of the transmission  system are the main rotor transmission, tail rotor drive  system, clutch, and freewheeling unit. The freewheeling unit  or autorotative clutch allows the main rotor transmission to  drive the tail rotor drive shaft during autorotation. In some  helicopter designs, such as the Bell BH-206, the freewheeling  unit is located in the accessory gearbox. Because it is part  of the transmission system, the transmission lubricates it to  ensure free rotation. Helicopter transmissions are normally  lubricated and cooled with their own oil supply. A sight gauge  is provided to check the oil level. Some transmissions have  chip detectors located in the sump, to detect loose pieces of  metal. These detectors are wired to warning lights located  on the pilot’s instrument panel that illuminate in the event  of an internal problem. Some chip detectors on modern  helicopters have a “burn off” capability and attempt to correct  the situation without pilot action. If the problem cannot be  corrected on its own, the pilot must refer to the emergency  procedures for that particular helicopter.  

# Main Rotor Transmission  

The primary purpose of the main rotor transmission is  to reduce engine output rpm to optimum rotor rpm. This  reduction is different for the various helicopters. As an  example, suppose the engine rpm of a specific helicopter  is 2,700. A rotor speed of   $450~\mathrm{rpm}$   would require a 6:1  reduction. A 9:1 reduction would mean the rotor would turn  at  $300\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

# Dual Tachometers  

Most helicopters use a dual-needle tachometer or a vertical  scale instrument to show both engine and rotor rpm or a  percentage of engine and rotor rpm. The rotor rpm indicator is  used during clutch engagement to monitor rotor acceleration,  and in autorotation to maintain rpm within prescribed limits.  It is vital to understand that rotor rpm is paramount, and that  engine rpm is secondary. If the rotor tachometer fails, rotor  rpm can still be determined indirectly by the engine rpm  during powered flight, because the engine drives the rotor at  a fixed, one-to-one ratio (by virtue of the sprag clutch). There  have been many accidents where the pilot responded to the  rotor rpm tachometer failure and entered into autorotation  while the engine was still operating.  

Look closer at the markings on the gauges in  Figure 4-18.  All  gauges shown are dual tachometer gauges. The two on the  left have two needles each, one marked with the letter ‘T’  (turbine) the other marked with the letter ‘R’ (rotor). The  lower left gauge shows two arced areas within the same  needle location. In this case, both needles should be nearly  together or superimposed during normal operation. Note the  top left gauge shows two numerical arcs. The outer arc, with  larger numbers, applies one set of values to engine rpm. The  inner arc, or smaller numbers, represents a separate set of  values for rotor rpm. Normal operating limits are shown when  the needles are married or appear superimposed. The top  right gauge shows independent needles, focused toward the  middle of the gauge, with colored limitation areas respective  to the needle head. The left side represents engine operational  parameters; the right, rotor operational parameters.  

In normal conditions when the rotor is coupled to the engine,  both needles move together in the same direction. However,  with a sudden loss in engine power the needles “split”  showing that the engine and rotor are no longer coupled as  the clutch has disconnected.  [Figure 4-19]  

Many newer aircraft have what is referred to as a glass  cockpit, meaning the instrumentation is digital and displayed  

![](images/614e3455ddc9ef6e4b18901169147bad27a9557f1329dd509b1c1d3fdbf5a8a4.jpg)

to the pilot on digital screens and vertical scale instruments.  The bottom right gauge in  Figure 4-18  replicates a vertical  scale instrument. The dual tachometer shown displays rotor  rpm (NR) on the left and engine rpm (NP) on the right side  of the vertical scale. Corresponding color limits are present  for each component parameter.  

# Structural Design  

In helicopters with horizontally mounted engines, another  purpose of the main rotor transmission is to change the  axis of rotation from the horizontal axis of the engine to the  vertical axis of the rotor shaft.  [Figure 4-20]  This differs  from airplanes, which have their propellers mounted directly  to the crankshaft or to a shaft that is geared to the crankshaft.  

Maintaining main rotor rpm is essential for adequate lift.  RPM within normal limits produces adequate lift for normal  maneuvering. Therefore, it is imperative not only to know  the location of the tachometers, but also to understand the  information they provide. If rotor rpm is allowed to go below  normal limits, the outcome could be catastrophic.  

# Clutch  

In a conventional airplane, the engine and propeller are  permanently connected. However, in a helicopter they are  not. Because of the greater weight of a rotor in relation to the  power of the engine, as compared to the weight of a propeller  and the power in an airplane, the rotor must be disconnected  from the engine when the starter is engaged. A clutch allows  the engine to be started and then gradually pick up the load  of the rotor.  

![](images/c5dc586f88827789c67542036cb4bdb2933aa5049d8df2aec331aab95fc28d7a.jpg)  
Figure 4-20.   The main rotor transmission reduces engine output  rpm to optimum rotor rpm.  

Freewheeling turbine engines do not require a separate clutch  since the air coupling between the gas producer turbine and  the power (takeoff) turbine functions as an air clutch for  starting purposes. When the engine is started, there is little  resistance from the power turbine. This enables the gas- producer turbine to accelerate to normal idle speed without  the load of the transmission and rotor system dragging it  down. As the gas pressure increases through the power  turbine, the rotor blades begin to turn, slowly at first and then  gradually accelerate to normal operating rpm.  

On reciprocating and fixed turbine engines, a clutch is  required to enable engine start. Air, or windmilling starts,  are not possible. The two main types of clutches are the  centrifugal clutch and the idler or manual clutch.  

How the clutch engages the main rotor system during engine  start differs between helicopter design. Piston-powered  helicopters have a means of engaging the clutch manually  just as a manual clutch in an automobile. This may be by  means of an electric motor that positions a pulley when the  engine is at the proper operating condition (oil temperature  and pressure in the appropriate range), but which is controlled  by a cockpit mounted switch.  

# Belt Drive Clutch  

Some helicopters utilize a belt drive to transmit power from  the engine to the transmission. A belt drive consists of a lower  pulley attached to the engine, an upper pulley attached to the  transmission input shaft, a belt or a set of V-belts, and some  means of applying tension to the belts. The belts fit loosely  over the upper and lower pulley when there is no tension on  the belts.  [Figure 4-21]  

![](images/b0a1c0d4c4133e186ff83d99d7770a502654acdcc7454f6f90ce4f69043d5c9b.jpg)  
Figure 4-21.  Idler or manual clutch.  

Some aircraft utilize a clutch for starting. This allows the  engine to be started without requiring power to turn the  transmission. One advantage this concept has is that without  a load on the engine starting may be accomplished with  minimal throttle application. However, caution should also  be used during starting, since rapid or large throttle inputs  may cause overspeeds.  

Once the engine is running, tension on the belts is gradually  increased. When the rotor and engine tachometer needles are  superimposed, the rotor and the engine are synchronized, and  the clutch is then fully engaged. Advantages of this system  include vibration isolation, simple maintenance. When the  clutch is not engaged, engines are very easy to overspeed,  resulting in costly inspections and maintenance. Power, or  throttle control, is very important in this phase of engine  operation.  

# Centrifugal Clutch  

A centrifugal clutch is made up of an inner assembly and  an outer drum. The inner assembly, which is connected to  the engine driveshaft, consists of shoes lined with material  similar to automotive brake linings. At low engine speeds,  springs hold the shoes in, so there is no contact with the outer  drum, which is attached to the transmission input shaft. As  engine speed increases, centrifugal force causes the clutch  shoes to move outward and begin sliding against the outer  drum. The transmission input shaft begins to rotate, causing  the rotor to turn slowly at first, but increasing as the friction  increases between the clutch shoes and transmission drum.  

As rotor speed increases, the rotor tachometer needle shows  an increase by moving toward the engine tachometer needle.  When the two needles are superimposed (in the case of a  coaxial-type gage), the engine and the rotor are synchronized,  indicating the clutch is fully engaged and there is no further  slippage of the clutch shoes.  

The turbine engine engages the clutch through centrifugal  force, as stated above. Unless a rotor brake is used to  separate the automatic engagement of the main driveshaft and  subsequently the main rotor, the drive shaft turns at the same  time as the engine and the inner drum of the freewheeling unit  engages gradually to turn the main rotor system.  

# Fuel Systems  

The fuel system in a helicopter is made up of two components:  supply and control.  

# Fuel Supply System  

The supply system consists of a fuel tank or tanks, fuel quantity  gauges, a shut-off valve, fuel filter, a fuel line to the engine,  and possibly a primer and fuel pumps.  [Figure 4-22]  The fuel  tanks are usually mounted to the airframe as close as possible  to the CG. This way, as fuel is burned off, there is a negligible  effect on the CG. A drain valve located on the bottom of the  fuel tank allows the pilot to drain water and sediment that may  have collected in the tank. A fuel vent prevents the formation  of a vacuum in the tank, and an overflow drain allows fuel to  expand without rupturing the tank.  

The fuel travels from the fuel tank through a shut-off valve,  which provides a means to completely stop fuel flow to the  engine in the event of an emergency or fire. The shut-off  valve remains in the open position for all normal operations.  

Most non-gravity feed fuel systems contain both an electric  pump and a mechanical engine-driven pump. The electrical  pump is used to maintain positive fuel pressure to the  engine pump and may also serve as a backup in the event of  mechanical pump failure. The electrical pump is controlled  by a switch in the cockpit. The engine driven pump is the  primary pump that supplies fuel to the engine and operates  any time the engine is running. A fuel filter removes moisture  and other sediment from the fuel before it reaches the engine.  These contaminants are usually heavier than fuel and settle to  the bottom of the fuel filter sump where they can be drained  out by the pilot.  

![](images/dbec1e7cba249c612d2fad3838f0bdb699678f80f0859521fe70512f125a18fa.jpg)  
Figure 4-22.  A typical gravity feed fuel system, in a helicopter with  a reciprocating engine, contains the components shown here.  

Some fuel systems contain a small hand-operated pump  called a primer. A primer allows fuel to be pumped directly  into the intake port of the cylinders prior to engine start. The  primer is useful in cold weather when fuel in the carburetor  is difficult to vaporize.  

A fuel quantity gauge located on the pilot’s instrument panel  shows the amount of fuel measured by a sensing unit inside  the tank. Most fuel gauges will indicate in gallons or pounds  and must be accurate only when empty.  

It is worth noting that in accordance with Title 14 of the Code  of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) section 27.1337(b)(1), fuel  quantity indicators “must be calibrated to read ‘zero’ during  level flight when the quantity of fuel remaining in the tank  is equal to the unusable fuel supply.” Therefore, it is of the  utmost importance that the pilot or operator determine an  accurate means of verifying partial or full fuel loads. It is  always a good habit, if possible, to visually verify the fuel on  board prior to flight and determine if adequate fuel is present  for the duration of the flight.  

Additionally, 14 CFR section 27.1305(l)(1) requires newer  helicopters to have warning systems “provide a warning  to the flight crew when approximately 10 minutes of  usable fuel remains in the tank.” Caution should be used  to eliminate unnecessary or erratic maneuvering that could  cause interruption of fuel flow to the engine. Although these  systems must be calibrated, never assume the entire amount  is available. Many pilots have not reached their destinations  due to poor fuel planning or faulty fuel indications.  

# Engine Fuel Control System  

Regardless of the device, the reciprocating engine and the  turbine engine both use the ignition and combustion of the  fuel/air mix to provide the source of their power. Engine  fuel control systems utilize several components to meter  the proper amount of fuel necessary to produce the required  amount of power. The fuel control system, in concert with  the air induction components, combines the proper amount of  fuel and air to be ignited in the combustion chamber. Refer  to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for a  detailed explanation and illustration.  

# Carburetor Ice  

The effect of fuel vaporization and/or a decrease of air  pressure in the venturi causes a rapid decrease in air  temperature in the carburetor. If the air is moist, the water  vapor in the air may condense causing ice to form in the  carburetor. If ice is allowed to form inside the carburetor,  engine failure is a very real possibility and the ability to  restart the engine is greatly reduced. Carburetor icing can  occur during any phase of flight but is particularly dangerous  when you are using reduced power, such as during a descent.  You may not notice it during the descent until you try to add  power. Indications of carburetor icing are a decrease in engine  rpm or manifold pressure, the carburetor air temperature  gauge indicating a temperature outside the safe operating  range, and engine roughness. A reciprocating engine with a  governor may mask the formation of carburetor ice since it  will maintain a constant manifold pressure and rpm.  

Since changes in rpm or manifold pressure can occur  for a number of reasons, closely check the carburetor  air temperature gauge when in possible carburetor icing  conditions. Carburetor air temperature gauges are marked  with a yellow caution arc or green operating arcs. In most  cases, it is best to keep the needle out of the yellow arc or  in the green arc. This is accomplished by using a carburetor  heat system, which eliminates the ice by routing air across  

![](images/064070812fea241dfde4f44d0f0eb1c88deb3a6a61e9ff2477e1b82ed7253c54.jpg)

a heat source, such as an exhaust manifold, before it enters  the carburetor. [ Figure 4-23 ] Refer to the RFM (see Chapter  5, Rotorcraft Flight Manual) for the specific procedure as to  when and how to apply carburetor heat.  

# Fuel Injection  

In a fuel injection system, fuel and air are metered at the fuel  control unit but are not mixed. The fuel is injected directly  into the intake port of the cylinder where it is mixed with  

![](images/84ef9db85507a7969c0279b581050048e6e3fd92e6e308f746d2e977fd2d0094.jpg)

However, ensure that all electrical equipment is turned off before starting the engine. This protects sensitive  components, particularly the radios, from damage that may be caused by random voltages generated during the starting process.  

the air just before entering the cylinder. This system ensures  a more even fuel distribution between cylinders and better  vaporization, which in turn promotes more efficient use of  fuel. Also, the fuel injection system eliminates the problem  of carburetor icing and the need for a carburetor heat system.  

# Electrical Systems  

The electrical systems, in most helicopters, reflect the  increased use of sophisticated avionics and other electrical  accessories.  [Figure 4-24]  More and more operations in  today’s flight environment are dependent on the aircraft’s  electrical system; however, all helicopters can be safely flown  without any electrical power in the event of an electrical  malfunction or emergency.  

Helicopters have either a 14- or 28-volt, direct-current  electrical system. On small, piston powered helicopters,  electrical energy is supplied by an engine-driven alternator  by means of a belt and pulley system similar to that of an  automobile. These alternators have advantages over older- style generators as they are lighter in weight, require lower  maintenance, and maintain a uniform electrical output even  at low engine rpm. (As a reminder, think of volts or voltage  as the measure of electrical pressure in the system, analogous  to pounds per square inch in water systems. Amperes is the  measure of electrical quantity in the system or available. For  example, a 100-amp alternator would be analogous to a 100  gallon per hour water pump.)  

Turbine-powered helicopters use a starter/generator system.  The starter/generator is permanently coupled to the accessory  gearbox. When starting the engine, electrical power from the  battery is supplied to the starter/generator, which turns the  engine over. Once the engine is running, the starter/generator  is driven by the engine and then functions as a generator.  

Current from the alternator or generator is delivered through a  voltage regulator to a bus bar. The voltage regulator maintains  the constant voltage required by the electrical system, by  regulating the output of the alternator or generator. An over- voltage control may be incorporated to prevent excessive  voltage, which may damage the electrical components. The  bus bar serves to distribute the current to the various electrical  components of the helicopter.  

A battery is used mainly for starting the engine. In addition,  it permits limited operation of electrical components, such  as radios and lights, without the engine running. The battery  is also a valuable source of standby or emergency electrical  power in the event of alternator or generator failure.  

An ammeter (or load meter) is used to monitor the electrical  current within the system. The ammeter reflects current  flowing to and from the battery. A charging ammeter  indicates that the battery is being charged. This is normal  after an engine start since the battery power used in starting  is being replaced. After the battery is charged, the ammeter  should stabilize near zero since the alternator or generator is  supplying the electrical needs of the system.  

An ammeter showing a discharge means the electrical load  is exceeding the output of the alternator or generator, and the  battery is helping to supply electrical power. This may mean  the alternator or generator is malfunctioning, or the electrical  load is excessive. An ammeter displays the load placed on the  alternator or generator by the electrical equipment. The RFM  (see page 5-1) for a particular helicopter shows the normal  load to expect. Loss of the alternator or generator causes the  load meter to indicate zero.  

Electrical switches are used to select electrical components.  Power may be supplied directly to the component or to a  relay, which in turn provides power to the component. Relays  are used when high current and/or heavy electrical cables are  required for a particular component, which may exceed the  capacity of the switch.  

Circuit breakers or fuses are used to protect various electrical  components from overload. A circuit breaker pops out when  its respective component is overloaded. The circuit breaker  may be reset by pushing it back in, unless a short or the  overload still exists. In this case, the circuit breaker continues  to pop, indicating an electrical malfunction. A fuse simply  burns out when it is overloaded and needs to be replaced.  Manufacturers usually provide a holder for spare fuses in the  event one has to be replaced in flight. Caution lights on the  instrument panel may be installed to show the malfunction  of an electrical component.  

# Hydraulics  

Most helicopters, other than smaller piston-powered  helicopters, incorporate the use of hydraulic actuators to  overcome high control forces.  [Figure 4-25]  A typical  hydraulic system consists of actuators, also called servos,  on each flight control, a pump which is usually driven by  the main rotor transmission and a reservoir to store the  hydraulic fluid. Some helicopters have accumulators located  on the pressure side of the hydraulic system. This allows for  a continuous fluid pressure into the system. A switch in the  cockpit can turn the system off, although it is left on under  normal conditions. When the pilot places the hydraulic  switch/circuit breaker into the on position, the electrical  power is being removed from the solenoid valve allowing  

![](images/0bfedf638c94b47b6fc5f5a9b9e3c2a89743976c2efc3bfa5c3012b597d06161.jpg)

hydraulic fluid to enter the system. When the switch/circuit breaker is put in the off position, the solenoid valve is now  de-energized and closes, which then allows the pilot to  maintain control of the helicopter with the hydraulic fluid in  the actuators. This is known as a failsafe system. If helicopter  electrical power is lost in flight, the pilot is still able to  maintain control of the hydraulic system. A pressure indicator  in the cockpit may also be installed to monitor the system.  

When making a control input, the servo is activated and  provides an assisting force to move the respective flight  control, thus reducing the force the pilot must provide. These  boosted flight controls ease pilot workload and fatigue. In  the event of hydraulic system failure, a pilot is still able to  control the helicopter, but the control forces are very heavy.  

In those helicopters in which the control forces are so high that  they cannot be moved without hydraulic assistance, two or  more independent hydraulic systems may be installed. Some  helicopters are designed to use their hydraulic accumulators  to store hydraulic pressure for an emergency, allowing for  uninterrupted use of the controls for a short period of time  following a hydraulic pump failure. This gives you enough  time to land the helicopter with normal control.  

# Stability Augmentations Systems  

Some helicopters incorporate a stability augmentation system  (SAS) to help stabilize the helicopter in flight and in a hover.  The original purpose and design allowed decreased pilot  workload and lessened fatigue. It allowed pilots to place an  aircraft at a set attitude to accomplish other tasks or simply  stabilize the aircraft for long cross-country flights.  

# Force Trim  

Force trim was a passive system that simply held the cyclic  in a position that gave a control force to transitioning airplane  pilots who had become accustomed to such control forces.  The system uses a magnetic clutch and springs to hold the  cyclic control in the position where it was released. The  system does not use sensor-based data to make corrections,  but rather is used by the pilot to “hold” the cyclic in a desired  position. The most basic versions only apply to the cyclic  requiring the pilot to continue power and tail rotor inputs.  With the force trim on or in use, the pilot can override the  system by disengaging the system through the use of a force  trim release button or, with greater resistance, can physically  manipulate the controls. Some recent basic systems are  referred to as attitude retention systems.  

# Active Augmentation Systems  

So-called actual augmentation systems use electric  actuators that provide input to the hydraulic servos. These  servos receive control commands from a computer that  senses external environmental inputs, such as wind and  turbulence. SAS complexity varies by manufacturer but can  be as sophisticated as providing three-axis stability. That is,  computer-based inputs adjust attitude, power and aircraft  trim for a more stabilized flight.  

Once engaged by the pilot, these actual systems use a  multitude of sensors, from stabilized gyros to electro- mechanical actuators, which provide instantaneous inputs  to all flight controls without pilot assistance. As with all  SASs, they may be overridden or disconnected by the pilot  at any time. Helicopters with complex Automatic Flight  Control Systems (AFCS) and autopilots normally have  a trim switch referred to as “beeper trim.” This switch is  used when minor changes to the trim setting are desired.  

Stability augmentation systems reduce pilot workload by  improving basic aircraft control harmony and decreasing  disturbances. These systems are very useful when the pilot  is required to perform other duties, such as sling loading and  search-and-rescue operations. Other inputs such as heading,  speed, altitude, and navigation information may be supplied  to the computer to form a complete autopilot system.  

# Autopilot  

Helicopter autopilot systems are similar to stability  augmentation systems, but they have additional features. An  autopilot can actually fly the helicopter and perform certain  functions selected by the pilot. These functions depend on  the type of autopilot and systems installed in the helicopter.  

The most common functions are altitude and heading hold.  Some more advanced systems include a vertical speed or  indicated airspeed (IAS) hold mode, where a constant rate  of climb/descent or IAS is maintained by the autopilot. Some  autopilots have navigation capabilities, such as very high  frequency (VHF) OmniRange Navigation System (VOR),  Instrument Landing System (ILS), and global positioning  system (GPS) intercept and tracking, which is especially  useful in instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions. This is  referred to as a coupled system. An additional component,  called a flight director (FD), may also be installed. The FD  provides visual guidance cues to the pilot to fly selected  lateral and vertical modes of operation. The most advanced  autopilots can fly an instrument approach to a hover without  any additional pilot input once the initial functions have  been selected.  

The autopilot system consists of electric actuators or servos  connected to the flight controls. The number and location of  these servos depends on the type of system installed. A two- axis autopilot controls the helicopter in pitch and roll; one  servo controls fore and aft cyclic, and another controls left  and right cyclic. A three-axis autopilot has an additional servo  connected to the antitorque pedals and controls the helicopter  in yaw. A four-axis system uses a fourth servo which controls  the collective. These servos move the respective flight  controls when they receive control commands from a central  computer. This computer receives data input from the flight  instruments for attitude reference and from the navigation  equipment for navigation and tracking reference. An autopilot  has a control panel in the cockpit that allows the pilot to  select the desired functions, as well as engage the autopilot.  

For safety purposes, an automatic disengagement feature  is usually included which automatically disconnects the  autopilot in heavy turbulence or when extreme flight attitudes  are reached. Even though all autopilots can be overridden  by the pilot, there is also an autopilot disengagement button  located on the cyclic or collective which allows pilots to  completely disengage the autopilot without removing their  hands from the controls. Because autopilot systems and  installations differ from one helicopter to another, it is very  important to refer to the autopilot operating procedures  located in the RFM.  

# Environmental Systems  

Heating and cooling the helicopter cabin can be accomplished  in different ways. The simplest form of cooling is by ram air.  Air ducts in the front or sides of the helicopter are opened or  closed by the pilot to let ram air into the cabin. This system  is limited as it requires forward airspeed to provide airflow  and also depends on the temperature of the outside air. Air  conditioning provides better cooling, but it is more complex  and weighs more than a ram air system.  

One of the simplest methods of cooling a helicopter is to  remove the doors allowing air to flow through the cockpit  and engine compartments. Care must be taken to store the  doors properly, whether in a designed door-holding rack in  a hangar, or if it is necessary to carry them on the flight, in  the helicopter. When storing the doors, care must be taken  to not scratch the windows. Special attention should be paid  to ensuring that all seat belt cushions and any other loose  items are stored away to prevent ingestion into the main or  tail rotor. When reattaching the doors, proper care must be  taken to ensure that they are fully secured and closed.  

Air conditioners or heat exchanges can be fitted to the  helicopter as well. They operate by drawing bleed air from  the compressor, passing it through the heart exchanger and  then releasing it into the cabin. As the compressed air is  released, the expansion absorbs heat and cools the cabin. The  disadvantage of this type of system is that power is required  to compress the air or gas for the cooling function, thus  robbing the engine of some of its capability. Some systems  are restricted from use during takeoff and landings.  

Piston-powered helicopters use a heat exchanger shroud  around the exhaust manifold to provide cabin heat. Outside  air is piped to the shroud and the hot exhaust manifold heats  the air, which is then blown into the cockpit. This warm air  is heated by the exhaust manifold but is not exhaust gas.  Turbine helicopters use a bleed air system for heat. Bleed air  is hot, compressed, discharge air from the engine compressor.  Hot air is ducted from the compressor to the bleed air heater  assembly where it is combined with ambient air through  and induction port mounted to the fuselage. The amount of  heat delivered to the helicopter cabin is regulated by a pilot- controlled bleed air mixing valve.  

# Anti-Icing Systems  

Anti-icing is the process of protecting against the formation  of frozen contaminant, snow, ice, or slush on a surface.  

cause icing of rotor blades and fuselages, rendering them  unflyable until cleaned. Asymmetrical shedding of ice from  the blades can lead to component failure, and shedding ice  can be dangerous as it may hit any structures or people that  are around the helicopter. The tail rotor is very vulnerable to  shedding ice damage. Thorough preflight checks should be  made before starting the rotor blades. If any ice was removed  prior to starting, ensure that the flight controls move freely.  While in flight, for those helicopters that have them, deicing  systems should be activated immediately after entry into an  icing condition.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discussed all of the common components,  sections, and systems of the helicopter. The chapter also  explained how each of them work with one another to make  flight possible.  

# Engine Anti-Ice  

The anti-icing system found on most turbine-powered  helicopters uses engine bleed air. Bleed air in turbine engines  is compressed air taken from within the engine, after the  compressor stage(s) and before the fuel is injected in the  burners. The bleed air flows through the inlet guide vanes  and to the inlet itself to prevent ice formation on the hollow  vanes. A pilot-controlled, electrically operated valve on the  compressor controls the air flow. Engine anti-ice systems  should be on prior to entry into icing conditions and remain  on until exiting those conditions. Use of the engine anti-ice  system should always be in accordance with the proper RFM.  

# Airframe Anti-Ice  

Airframe and rotor anti-icing may be found on some larger  helicopters, but it is not common due to the complexity,  expense, and weight of such systems. The leading edges of  rotors may be heated with bleed air or electrical elements to  prevent ice formation. Balance and control problems might  arise if ice is allowed to form unevenly on the blades. Research  is being done on lightweight ice-phobic (anti-icing) materials  or coatings. These materials placed in strategic areas could  significantly reduce ice formation and improve performance.  

The pitot tube on a helicopter is very susceptible to ice and  moisture buildup as well. To prevent this, they are usually  equipped with a heating system that uses an electrical element  to heat the tube.  

# Deicing  

Deicing is the process of removing frozen contaminant,  snow, ice, and/or slush from a surface. Deicing of the  helicopter fuselage and rotor blades is critical prior to starting.  Helicopters that are unsheltered by hangars are subject  to frost, snow, freezing drizzle, and freezing rain that can

# Rotorcraft Flight Manual  

# Introduction  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part  91 requires pilot compliance with the operating limitations  specified in approved rotorcraft flight manuals, markings, and  placards. Originally, flight manuals were often characterized  by a lack of essential information and followed whatever  format and content the manufacturer deemed appropriate.  This changed with the acceptance of the General Aviation  Manufacturers Association (GAMA) specification for a  Pilot’s Operating Handbook, which established a standardized  format for all general aviation airplane and rotorcraft flight  manuals. The term “Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)” is  often used in place of “Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM).”  However, if “Pilot’s Operating Handbook” is used as the main  title instead of “Rotorcraft Flight Manual,” a statement must  be included on the title page indicating that the document  is the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved  Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM).  [Figure 5-1]  

Not including the preliminary pages, an FAA-approved  RFM may contain as many as ten sections. These sections  are: General Information; Operating Limitations; Emergency  Procedures; Normal Procedures; Performance; Weight  and Balance; Aircraft and Systems Description; Handling,  Servicing, and Maintenance Supplements; and Safety  and Operational Tips. Manufacturers have the option of  including a tenth section on safety and operational tips and  an alphabetical index at the end of the handbook.  

# Preliminary Pages  

While RFMs may appear similar for the same make and  model of aircraft, each flight manual is unique since it  contains specific information about a particular aircraft,  such as the equipment installed, and weight and balance  information. Therefore, manufacturers are required to include  the serial number and registration on the title page to identify  the aircraft to which the flight manual belongs. If a flight  manual does not indicate a specific aircraft registration and  serial number, it is limited to general study purposes only.  

Most manufacturers include a table of contents, which  identifies the order of the entire manual by section number  and title. In addition, some helicopters may include a log of  changes or a revision page to track changes to the manual.  Usually, each section also contains its own table of contents.  Page numbers reflect the section being read, 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, and  so on. If the flight manual is published in looseleaf form, each  section is usually marked with a divider tab indicating the  section number or title, or both. The emergency procedures  section may have a red tab for quick identification and  reference.  

![](images/a6e867e96583cc43f27488ec39600f689e179c3bc3f9252d2e9e5ef8f6f64988.jpg)  
Figure 5-1.  The RFM is a regulatory document in terms of the  maneuvers, procedures, and operating limitations described therein.  

# General Information (Section 1)  

The general information section provides the basic descriptive  information on the rotorcraft and the powerplant. In some  manuals there is a three-view drawing of the rotorcraft that  provides the dimensions of various components, including  the overall length and width, and the diameter of the rotor  systems. This is a good place for pilots to quickly familiarize  themselves with the aircraft. Pilots need to be aware of the  dimensions of the helicopter since they often must decide  the suitability of an operations area for themselves, as well  as hanger space, landing pad, and ground handling needs.  

Pilots can find definitions, abbreviations, explanations of  symbology, and some of the terminology used in the manual  at the end of this section. At the option of the manufacturer,  metric and other conversion tables may also be included.  

# Operating Limitations (Section 2)  

The operating limitations section contains only those  limitations required by regulation or that are necessary for  the safe operation of the rotorcraft, powerplant, systems,  and equipment. It includes operating limitations, instrument  markings, color coding, and basic placards. Some of the  areas included are: airspeed, altitude, rotor, and powerplant  limitations, including fuel and oil requirements; weight and  loading distribution; and flight limitations.  

# Instrument Markings  

Instrument markings may include, but are not limited to,  green, red, and yellow ranges for the safe operation of the  aircraft. The green marking indicates a range of continuous  operation. The red range indicates the maximum or minimum  operation allowed while the yellow range indicates a caution  or transition area.  

# Airspeed Limitations  

Airspeed limitations are shown on the airspeed indicator  by color coding and on placards or graphs in the aircraft. A  red line on the airspeed indicator shows the airspeed limit  beyond which structural damage could occur. This is called  the never exceed speed, or  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$  . The normal operating speed  range is depicted by a green arc. A blue or a red cross-hatched  line is sometimes added to show the maximum autorotation  speed.  [Figure 5-2]  

Other airspeed limitations may be included in this section  of the RFM. Examples include reduced  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   when doors are  removed, maximum airspeed for level flight with maximum  continuous power   $\mathrm{(V_{H})}$  , or restrictions when carrying an  external load. Pilots need to understand and adhere to all  airspeed limitations appropriate to the make, model, and  configuration of the helicopter being flown.  

![](images/3ec3ccd4a2fc451aa85ed68bb092a5462931255c40551743febd81be9b3b49fd.jpg)  

# Altitude Limitations  

If the rotorcraft has a maximum operating density altitude  (see page 7-2), it is indicated in this section of the flight  manual. Sometimes the maximum altitude varies based on  different gross weights.  

# Rotor Limitations  

Low rpm does not produce sufficient lift, and high rpm may  cause structural damage, therefore rotor rpm limitations have  minimum and maximum values. A green arc depicts the  normal operating range with red lines showing the minimum  and maximum limits.  [Figure 5-3]  

There are two different rotor rpm limitations: power-on and  power-off. Power-on limitations apply anytime the engine  is turning the rotor and is depicted by a fairly narrow green  band. A yellow arc may be included to show a transition  range, which means that operation within this range is limited  due to the possibility of increased vibrations or harmonics.  This range may be associated with tailboom dynamic modes.  Power-off limitations apply anytime the engine is not turning  the rotor, such as when in an autorotation. In this case, the  green arc is wider than the power-on arc, indicating a larger  operating range.  

# Powerplant Limitations  

The powerplant limitations area describes operating  limitations on the helicopter’s engine including such items  as rpm range, power limitations, operating temperatures,  and fuel and oil requirements. Most turbine engines and  some reciprocating engines have a maximum power and a  

![](images/cb7cf8ff67a2f7e98753147a4409d9e1f099e72b33e1170d95298f9bada08310.jpg)

maximum continuous power rating. The “maximum power”   rating is the maximum power the engine can generate and  is usually limited by time. The maximum power range is  depicted by a yellow arc on the engine power instruments,  with a red line indicating the maximum power that must not   be exceeded. “Maximum continuous power” is the maximum  power the engine can generate continually and is depicted  by a green arc.  [Figure 5-4]  

Manifold pressure is a measure of vacuum at the intake  manifold. It is the difference between the air pressure  (or vacuum) inside the intake manifold and the relative  atmospheric pressure of the air around the engine. The  red line on a manifold pressure gauge indicates the  maximum amount of power. A yellow arc on the gauge  warns of pressures approaching the limit of rated power.

Figure 5-4.  Torque and turbine outlet temperature (TOT) gauges  are commonly used with turbine-powered aircraft.  

[Figure 5-5]  A placard near the gauge lists the maximum  readings for specific conditions.  

# Weight and Loading Distribution  

The weight and loading distribution section of the  manufacturer's RFM contains the maximum certificated  weights, as well as the center of gravity (CG) range. The  location of the reference datum used in balance computations  should also be included in this section. Weight and balance  computations are not provided here, but rather in the weight  and balance section of the RFM.  

# Flight Limitations  

This area lists any maneuvers which are prohibited, such  as acrobatic flight or flight into known icing conditions. If  the rotorcraft can only be flown in visual flight rules (VFR)  conditions, it is noted in this area. Also included are the  minimum crew requirements, and the pilot seat location, if  applicable, from which solo flights must be conducted.  

# Placards  

All rotorcraft generally have one or more placards displayed  that have a direct and important bearing on the safe operation  of the rotorcraft. These placards are located in a conspicuous  place within the cabin and normally appear in the limitations  section. Since  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   varies with altitude, this placard can be  found in all helicopters.  [Figure 5-6]  

![](images/874cf6b444f21e035e51502598559905c68cc15674eb4342c0861cb93460121e.jpg)

# Emergency Procedures (Section 3)  

Concise checklists describing the recommended procedures  and airspeeds for coping with various types of emergencies  or critical situations can be found in this section. Some of   the emergencies covered include: engine failure in a hover  and at altitude, tail rotor failures, fires, and systems failures.  The procedures for restarting an engine and for ditching in  the water might also be included.  

Manufacturers may first show the emergencies checklists in  an abbreviated form with the order of items reflecting the  sequence of action. This is followed by amplified checklists  providing additional information to clarify the procedure. To  be prepared for an abnormal or emergency situation, learn  the first steps of each checklist, if not all the steps. If time  permits, refer to the checklist to make sure all items have  been covered. For more information on emergencies, refer  to Chapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards.  

Manufacturers are encouraged to include an optional area  titled Abnormal Procedures, which describes recommended  procedures for handling malfunctions that are not considered  to be emergencies. This information would most likely be  found in larger helicopters.  

# Normal Procedures (Section 4)  

The normal procedures section is the section most frequently  used. It usually begins with a listing of airspeeds that  may enhance the safety of normal operations. It is a good  idea to learn the airspeeds that are used for normal flight  operations. The next part of the section includes several  checklists, which cover the preflight inspection, before-  starting procedure, how to start the engine, rotor engagement,  ground checks, takeoff, approach, landing, and shutdown.  Some manufacturers also include the procedures for practice  autorotations. To avoid skipping an important step, always  use a checklist when one is available. More information  on maneuvers can be found in Chapter 9, Basic Flight  Maneuvers, and Chapter 10, Advanced Flight Maneuvers.  

# Performance (Section 5)  

The performance section contains all the information required  by the regulations and any additional performance information  the manufacturer determines may enhance a pilot’s ability to  operate the helicopter safely. Although the performance section  is not in the limitation section and is therefore not a limitation,  operation outside or beyond the flight-tested and documented  performance section can be expensive, slightly hazardous, or  outright dangerous to life and property. If the helicopter is  certificated under 14 CFR part 29, then the performance section  may very well be a restrictive limitation. In any event, a pilot  should determine the performance available and plan to stay  within those parameters.  

These charts, graphs, and tables vary in style, but all contain  the same basic information. Some examples of the performance  information that can be found in most flight manuals include  a calibrated versus indicated airspeed conversion graph,  hovering ceiling versus gross weight charts, and a height- velocity diagram.  [Figure 5-7]  For information on how to use  the charts, graphs, and tables, refer to Chapter 7, Helicopter  Performance.  

# Weight and Balance (Section 6)  

The weight and balance section should contain all the  information required by the FAA that is necessary to calculate  weight and balance. To help compute the proper data, most  manufacturers include sample problems. Weight and balance  is detailed in Chapter 6, Weight and Balance.  

# Aircraft and Systems Description  (Section 7)  

The aircraft and systems description section is an excellent  place to study all the systems found on an aircraft. The  manufacturers should describe the systems in a manner that  is understandable to most pilots. For larger, more complex  

![](images/7e6288e4ed40b61f0e9cc72a8b55597e5a00078d5444e989ac4306c308a6d147.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.  One of the performance charts in the performance  section is the In Ground Effect Hover Ceiling versus Gross Weight  chart. This chart can be used to determine how much weight can  be carried and still operate at a specific pressure altitude or, if  carrying a specific weight, detrmine that specific altitude limitation.  

helicopters, the manufacturer may assume a higher degree of  knowledge. For more information on helicopter systems, refer  to Chapter 4, Helicopter Components, Sections, and Systems.  

# Handling, Servicing, and Maintenance  (Section 8)  

The handling, servicing, and maintenance section describes  the maintenance and inspections recommended by the  manufacturer, as well as those required by the regulations,  and airworthiness directive (AD) compliance procedures.  There are also suggestions on how the pilot/operator can  ensure that the work is done properly.  

This section also describes preventative maintenance that  may be accomplished by certificated pilots, as well as the  manufacturer’s recommended ground handling procedures,  including considerations for hangaring, tie down, and general  storage procedures for the helicopter.  

# Supplements (Section 9)  

The supplements section describes pertinent information  necessary to operate optional equipment installed on the  helicopter that would not be installed on a standard aircraft.  Some of this information may be supplied by the aircraft  manufacturer, or by the maker of the optional equipment.  The information is then inserted into the flight manual at the  time the equipment is installed.  

Since civilian manuals are not updated to the extent of  military manuals, the pilot must learn to read the supplements  after determining what equipment is installed and amend  their daily use checklists to integrate the supplemental  instructions and procedures. This is why air carriers must  furnish checklists to their crews. Those checklists furnished  to the crews must incorporate all procedures from any and all  equipment actually installed in the aircraft and the approved  company procedures.  

# Safety and Operational Tips (Section 10)  

The safety and operational tips section is optional and  contains a review of information that could enhance the  safety of the operation. Manufacturers may include best  operating practices and other recommended procedures for  the enhancement of safety and reducing accidents. Some  examples of the information that might be covered include  physiological factors, general weather information, fuel  conservation procedures, external load warnings, low rotor  rpm considerations, and recommendations that if not adhered  to, could lead to an emergency.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter familiarized the reader with the RFM. It  detailed each section and explained how to follow and better  understand the flight manual to enhance safety of flight.  

# Chapter 6 Weight and Balance  

# Introduction  

It is vital to comply with weight and balance limits  established for helicopters. Operating above the maximum  weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of  the helicopter and adversely affects performance. Balance  is also critical because, on some fully loaded helicopters,  center of gravity (CG) deviations as small as three inches can  dramatically change a helicopter’s handling characteristics.  Operating a helicopter that is not within the weight and  balance limitations is unsafe. Refer to FAA-H-8083-1 (as  revised), Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook, for more  detailed information.  

# Weight  

When determining if a helicopter is within the weight limits,  consider the weight of the basic helicopter, crew, passengers,  cargo, and fuel. Although the effective weight (load factor)  varies during maneuvering flight, this chapter primarily  addresses the weight of the loaded helicopter while at rest.  

It is critical to understand that the maximum allowable weight  may change during the flight. When operations include out of  ground effect (OGE) hovers and confined areas, planning must  be done to ensure that the helicopter is capable of lifting the  weight during all phases of flight. The weight may be acceptable  during the early morning hours, but as the density altitude  increases during the day, the maximum allowable weight may  have to be reduced to keep the helicopter within its capability.  

The following terms are used when computing a helicopter’s  weight:  

• 	 Basic Empty Weight • 	 Maximum Gross Weight • 	 Weight Limitations  

# Basic Empty Weight  

The starting point for weight computations is the basic empty  weight. This is the weight of the standard helicopter, optional  equipment, unusable fuel, and all operating fluids including  engine and transmission oil, and hydraulic fluid for those  aircraft so equipped. Some helicopters might use the term  “licensed empty weight,” which is nearly the same as basic  empty weight, except that it does not include full engine and  transmission oil, just undrainable oil. If flying a helicopter  that lists a licensed empty weight, be sure to add the weight  of the oil to the computations.  

# Maximum Gross Weight  

The maximum weight of the helicopter is referred to its  maximum gross weight. Most helicopters have an internal  maximum gross weight, which refers to the weight within the  helicopter structure and an external maximum gross weight,  which refers to the weight of the helicopter with an external  load. The external maximum weight may vary depending  on where it is attached to the helicopter. Some large cargo  helicopters may have several attachment points for sling load  or winch operations. These helicopters can carry a tremendous  amount of weight when the attachment point is directly under  the CG of the aircraft.  

# Weight Limitations  

Weight limits are necessary to guarantee the structural  integrity of the helicopter, enable pilots to predict helicopter  performance and insure aircraft controllability. Although  aircraft manufacturers build in safety factors, a pilot should  never intentionally exceed the load limits for which a  helicopter is certificated.  

Operating below a minimum weight could adversely affect  the handling characteristics of the helicopter. During single- pilot operations in some helicopters, a pilot needs to use a  large amount of forward cyclic to maintain a hover. By adding  ballast to the helicopter, the neutral cyclic position can be  shifted toward the center of its range, thus giving a greater  range of control outward from neutral in every direction.  When operating at or below the minimum weight of the  helicopter, additional weight also improves autorotational  characteristics since the autorotational descent can be  established sooner. In addition, operating below minimum  weight could prevent achieving the desirable rotor revolutions  per minute (rpm) during autorotations.  

Operating above a maximum weight could result in  structural deformation or failure during flight if encountering  excessive load factors, strong wind gusts, or turbulence.  Weight and maneuvering limitations also are factors in  establishing fatigue life of components. Overweight, meaning  overstressed, parts fail sooner than anticipated. Therefore,  premature failure is a major consideration in determination  of fatigue life and life cycles of parts.  

Although a helicopter is certificated for a specified maximum  gross weight, it is not safe to take off with this load under  some conditions. Anything that adversely affects takeoff,  climb, hovering, and landing performance may require  off-loading of fuel, passengers, or baggage to some weight  less than the published maximum. Factors that can affect  performance include high altitude, high temperature, and high  humidity conditions, which result in a high-density altitude.  In-depth performance planning is critical when operating in  these conditions.  

# Balance  

Helicopter performance is not only affected by gross weight,  but also by the position of that weight. It is essential to load the  aircraft within the allowable CG range specified in the rotorcraft  flight manual’s (RFM) weight and balance limitations. Loading  outside approved limits can result in insufficient control travel  for safe operation.  

# Center of Gravity  

The pilot should ensure that the helicopter is properly balanced  and within its center of gravity limitations, so that minimal  cyclic input is required during hovering flight, except for  any wind corrections. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum  suspended from the rotor, changing the CG changes the angle  at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor. When the CG is  directly under the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontally;  if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangs  with its nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the mast,  the nose tilts up.  [Figure 6-1]  

# CG Forward of Forward Limit  

A forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger  take off without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the  rotor mast. This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks  are located aft of the rotor mast because as fuel burns the  CG continues to shift forward.  

This condition is easily recognized when coming to a hover  following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter has a nose-low  attitude, and excessive rearward displacement of the cyclic  control is needed to maintain a hover in a no-wind condition.  Do not continue flight in this condition, since a pilot could  rapidly lose rearward cyclic control as fuel is consumed. A  pilot may also find it impossible to decelerate sufficiently to  bring the helicopter to a stop. In the event of engine failure  and the resulting autorotation, there may not be enough cyclic  control to flare properly for the landing.  

A forward CG is not as obvious when hovering into a strong  wind, since less rearward cyclic displacement is required than  when hovering with no wind. When determining whether a  critical balance condition exists, it is essential to consider the  wind velocity and its relation to the rearward displacement  of the cyclic control.  

# CG Aft of Aft Limit  

Without proper ballast in the cockpit, exceeding the aft CG  may occur when:  

•	 A lightweight pilot takes off solo with a full load of  fuel located aft of the rotor mast. •	 A lightweight pilot takes off with maximum baggage  allowed in a baggage compartment located aft of the  rotor mast. •	 A lightweight pilot takes off with a combination of  baggage and substantial fuel where both are aft of the  rotor mast.  

A pilot can recognize the aft CG condition when coming  to a hover following a vertical takeoff. The helicopter will  have a tail-low attitude and will need excessive forward  displacement of cyclic control to maintain a hover in a no- wind condition. When facing upwind, even greater forward  cyclic is needed.  

If flight is continued in this condition, it may be impossible  to fly in the upper allowable airspeed range due to inadequate  forward cyclic authority to maintain a nose-low attitude. In  addition, with an extreme aft CG, gusty or rough air could  accelerate the helicopter to a speed faster than that produced  with full forward cyclic control. In this case, dissymmetry of  lift and blade flapping could cause the rotor disk to tilt aft.  With full forward cyclic control already applied, a pilot might  not be able to lower the rotor disk, resulting in possible loss  of control, or the rotor blades striking the tailboom.  

# Lateral Balance  

For smaller helicopters, it is generally unnecessary to  determine the lateral CG for normal flight instruction and  passenger flights. This is because helicopter cabins are  relatively narrow and most optional equipment is located  near the centerline. However, some helicopter manuals  specify the seat from which a pilot must conduct solo flight.  In addition, if there is an unusual situation that could affect  the lateral CG, such as a heavy pilot and a full load of fuel  on one side of the helicopter, its position should be checked  against the CG envelope. If carrying external loads in a  position that requires large lateral cyclic control displacement  to maintain level flight, fore and aft cyclic effectiveness could  be limited dramatically. Manufacturers generally account  for known lateral CG displacements by locating external  attachment points opposite the lateral imbalance. Examples  are placement of hoist systems attached to the side, and wing  stores commonly used on military aircraft for external fuel  pods or armament systems.

Figure 6-1.  The location of the CG strongly influences how the helicopter handles.  

# Weight and Balance Calculations  

When determining whether a helicopter is properly loaded,  two questions must be answered:  

1. 	 Is the gross weight less than or equal to the maximum  allowable gross weight? 2. 	 Is the CG within the allowable CG range, and will  it stay within the allowable range throughout the  duration of flight including all loading configurations  that may be encountered?  

To answer the first question, just add the weight of the items  comprising the useful load (pilot, passengers, fuel, oil [if  applicable] cargo, and baggage) to the basic empty weight of  the helicopter. Ensure that the total weight does not exceed  the maximum allowable gross weight.  

To answer the second question, use CG or moment  information from loading charts, tables, or graphs in the  RFM. It is important to note that any weight and balance  computation is only as accurate as the information provided.  Therefore, ask passengers what they weigh and add a few  pounds to account for the additional weight of clothing,  especially during the winter months. Baggage should be  weighed on a scale, if practical. If a scale is not available,  compute personal loading values according to each individual  estimate.  Figure 6-2  indicates the standard weights for  specific operating fluids. These values are used when  computing a helicopter’s balance.  

# Reference Datum  

Balance is determined by the location of the CG, which  is usually described as a given number of inches from the  reference datum. The horizontal reference datum is an  imaginary vertical plane or point, arbitrarily fixed somewhere  along the longitudinal axis of the helicopter, from which all  horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance  

![](images/07b1413b26153fbd9bb2eca4536767c018abf1223e18b3f4f065394ef1ecd93e.jpg)  

purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location. It may be  located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even  at a point in space ahead of the helicopter.  [Figure 6-3]  

The lateral reference datum is usually located at the center  of the helicopter. The location of the reference datum is  established by the manufacturer and is defined in the RFM.  [Figure 6-4]  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discusses the importance of computing the  weight and balance of the helicopter. The chapter also  discusses the common terms and meanings associate with  weight and balance.

Figure 6-3.  While the horizontal reference datum can be anywhere  the manufacturer chooses, some manufacturers choose the datum  line at or ahead of the most forward structural point on the  helicopter, in which case all moments are positive. This aids in  simplifying calculations. Other manufacturers choose the datum  line at some point in the middle of the helicopter, in which case  moments produced by weight in front of the datum are negative and  moments produced by weight aft of the datum are positive.

Figure 6-4.  The lateral reference datum is located longitudinally  through the center of the helicopter; therefore, there are positive  and negative values.  

# Chapter 7 Helicopter Performance  

# Introduction  

A pilot’s ability to predict the performance of a helicopter is  extremely important. It helps to determine how much weight  the helicopter can carry before takeoff, if the helicopter  can safely hover at a spe­ cific altitude and temperature, the  distance required to climb above obstacles, and what the  maximum climb rate will be.  

# Factors Affecting Performance  

A helicopter’s performance is dependent on the power output  of the engine and the lift produced by the rotors, whether  it is the main rotor(s) or tail rotor. Any factor that affects  engine and rotor efficiency affects performance. The three  major factors that affect per­ formance are density altitude,  weight, and wind. The Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge, FAA-H-8083-25 (as revised), discusses these  factors in great detail.  

# Moisture (Humidity)  

Humidity alone is usually not considered an important factor  in calculating density altitude and helicopter performance;  however, it does contribute. There are no rules of thumb used  to compute the effects of humidity on density altitude, but  some manufacturers include charts with 80 percent relative  humidity columns as additional information. There appears  to be an approximately 3–4 percent reduction in performance  compared to dry air at the same altitude and temperature,  so expect a decrease in hovering and takeoff performance  in high humidity conditions. Although 3–4 percent seems  insignificant, it can be the cause of a mishap when already  operating at the limits of the helicopter.  

# Weight  

Weight is one of the most important factors because the pilot  can control it. Most performance charts include weight as one  of the variables. By reducing the weight of the helicopter, a  pilot may be able to take off or land safely at a location that  otherwise would be impossible. However, if ever in doubt  about whether a takeoff or landing can be performed safely,  delay your takeoff until more favorable density altitude  conditions exist. If airborne, try to land at a location that has  more favorable conditions, or one where a landing can be  made that does not require a hover.  

In addition, at higher gross weights, the increased power  required to hover produces more torque, which means more  antitorque thrust is required. In some heli­ copters during high  altitude operations, the maximum antitorque produced by the  tail rotor during a hover may not be sufficient to overcome  torque even if the gross weight is within limits.  

# Winds  

Wind direction and velocity also affect hovering, take­ off, and  climb performance. Translational lift occurs any time there  is relative airflow over the rotor disk. This occurs whether  the relative airflow is caused by helicopter movement or by  the wind. Assuming a headwind, as wind speed increases,  translational lift increases, resulting in less power required  to hover.  

The wind direction is also an important consideration.  Headwinds are the most desirable as they contribute to the  greatest increase in performance. Strong crosswinds and  tailwinds may require the use of more tail rotor thrust to  maintain directional control. This increased tail rotor thrust  absorbs power from the engine, which means there is less  power available to the main rotor for the production of  lift. Some helicopters even have a critical wind azimuth or  maximum safe relative wind chart. Operating the helicopter  beyond these limits could cause loss of tail rotor effectiveness.  

Takeoff and climb performance is greatly affected by wind.  When taking off into a headwind, effective trans­ lational lift  is achieved earlier, resulting in more lift and a steeper climb  angle. When taking off with a tailwind, more distance is  required to accelerate through transla­ tion lift.  

# Performance Charts  

In developing performance charts, aircraft manufacturers  make certain assumptions about the condition of the  helicopter and the ability of the pilot. It is assumed that  the helicopter is in good operating condition, calm wind,  and the engine is developing its rated power. The pilot is  assumed to be following normal operating procedures and  to have average flying abilities. Average means a pilot  capable of doing each of the required tasks cor­ rectly and at  the appropriate times.  

Using these assumptions, the manufacturer devel­ ops  performance data for the helicopter based on actual flight  tests. However, they do not test the hel­ icopter under each  and every condition shown on a performance chart. Instead,  they evaluate specific data and mathematically derive the  remaining data.  

# Height/Velocity Diagram  

The height/velocity (H/V) diagram shows the combinations  of airspeed and height above the ground, which will allow  an average pilot to successfully complete a landing after  an engine failure. By carefully studying the height/velocity  diagram, a pilot is able to avoid the combinations of altitude  and airspeed that may not allow sufficient time or altitude to  enter a stabilized autorotative descent. Refer to  Figure 7-1 during the remainder of the discussion on the height/velocity  diagram.  

In the simplest explanation, the H/V diagram is a diagram in  which the shaded areas should be avoided, as the pilot may be  unable to complete an autorotation landing without damage.  The H/V diagram usually contains a takeoff profile, where the  diagram can be traversed from zero height and zero speed to  

![](images/cf19cb643fe47cbdd7b8180c28b7c7ecc0ec81f2692b54fa11fcba85c9d31f05.jpg)

cruise, without entering the shaded areas or with minimum  exposure to shaded areas.  

The grey portion on the left side of the diagram marks a flight  profile that probably does not allow the pilot to complete an  autorotation successfully, primarily due to having insufficient  airspeed to enter an autorotative profile in time to avoid  a crash. The shaded area on the lower right is dangerous  due to the airspeed and proximity to the ground resulting  in dramatically reduced reaction time for the pilot in the  case of mechanical failure, or other in-flight emergencies.  This shaded area at the lower right is not portrayed in H/V  diagrams for multiengine helicopters capable of safely  hovering and flying with a single engine failure.  

The following examples further illustrate the relevance of  the H/V diagram to a single-engine helicopter.  

At low heights with low airspeed, such as a hover taxi, the  pilot can simply use the kinetic energy from the rotor disk  to cushion the landing with collective, converting rotational  inertia to lift. The aircraft is in a safe part of the H/V diagram.  At the extreme end of the scale (e.g., a three-foot hover  taxi at walking pace) even a complete failure to recognize  the power loss resulting in an uncushioned landing would  probably be survivable.  

As the airspeed increases without an increase in height, there  comes a point at which the pilot’s reaction time would be  insufficient to react with a flare in time to prevent a high  speed, and thus probably fatal, ground impact. Another thing  to consider is the length of the tailboom and the response  time of the helicopter flight controls at slow airspeeds and  low altitudes. Even small increases in height give the pilot  much greater time to react; therefore, the bottom right part of  the H/V diagram is usually a shallow gradient. If airspeed is  above ideal autorotation speed, the pilot’s instinct is usually  to flare to convert speed to height and increase rotor rpm  through coning, which also immediately gets them out of the  dead man’s curve.  

Conversely, an increase in height without a corresponding  increase in airspeed puts the aircraft above a survivable  uncushioned impact height, and eventually above a height  where rotor inertia can be converted to sufficient lift to enable  a survivable landing. This occurs abruptly with airspeeds  much below the ideal autorotative speed (typically 40–80  knots). The pilot must have enough time to accelerate to  autorotation speed in order to autorotate successfully; this  directly relates to a requirement for height. Above a certain  height the pilot can achieve autorotation speed even from a  zero knot start, thus putting high OGE hovers outside the  curve.  

The typical safe takeoff profile involves initiation of forward  flight from a 2–3 feet landing gear height, only gaining  altitude as the helicopter accelerates through translational  lift, as airspeed approaches a safe autorotative speed. At this  point, some of the increased thrust available may be used to  attain safe climb airspeed, which will keep the helicopter out  of the shaded or hatched areas of the H/V diagram. Although  helicopters are not restricted from conducting maneuvers  that will place them in the shaded area of the H/V diagram,  it is important for pilots to understand that operation in  those shaded areas exposes pilot, aircraft, and passengers to  a certain hazard should the engine or driveline malfunction.  The pilot should always evaluate the risk of the maneuver  versus the operational value.  

# The Effect of Weight Versus Density Altitude  

The height/velocity diagram  [Figure 7-1]  depicts altitude and  airspeed situations from which a successful autorotation can  be made. The time required, and therefore, altitude necessary  to attain a steady state autorotative descent, is dependent on  the weight of the helicopter and the density altitude. For this  reason, the H/V diagram is valid only when the helicopter is  operated in accordance with the gross weight versus density  altitude chart. If published, this chart is found in the RFM  for the particular helicopter.  [Figure 7-2]  The gross weight  

![](images/89924ff4a9441c8ced25d084bfda99d2443bb83539529cdd2b1fa9e6848d71f0.jpg)  
Figure 7-2.  Gross weight versus density altitude.  

versus density altitude chart is not intended to provide a  restriction to gross weight, but to be an advisory of the  autorotative capability of the helicopter during takeoff and  climb. A pilot must realize, however, that at gross weights  above those recommended by the gross weight versus density  altitude chart, the values are unknown.  

Assuming a density altitude of 8,500 feet, the height/velocity  diagram in  Figure 7-1  would be valid up to a gross weight of  approximately 2,500 pounds. This is found by entering the  graph in  Figure 7-2  at a density altitude of 8,500 feet (point A),  then moving horizontally to the solid line (point B). Moving  vertically to the bottom of the graph (point C), with the existing  density altitude, the maximum gross weight under which the  height/velocity diagram is applicable is 2,500 pounds.  

The production of performance charts and diagrams for  helicopters are regulatory as set out in Title 14 of the Code  of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) Part 27, Airworthiness  Standards. These charts establish safer parameters for  operation. Although not regulatory, the pilot should carry  out a full risk assessment to carefully consider the higher  risk before operating within the shaded areas of the height/ velocity diagram.  

# Autorotational Performance  

Most autorotational performance charts state that autorotational  descent performance is a function of indicated airspeed (IAS)  and is essentially unaffected by density altitude and gross  weight. Keep in mind that, at some point, the potential energy  expended during the autorotation is converted into kinetic  energy for the flare and touchdown phase of the maneuver. It is  at that point that increased density altitudes and heavier gross  weights have a great impact on the successful completion of  the autorotation. The rotor disk must be able to overcome the  downward momentum of the helicopter and provide enough  lift to cushion the landing. With increased density altitudes  and gross weights, the lift potential is reduced and a higher  collective pitch angle (angle of incidence) is required.  

During autorotation gravity provides the source of energy  powering the rotor by causing upflow up through the rotor  during descent. This is the same as saying that potential  energy is being traded for kinetic energy to turn the rotor as  the aircraft descends.  

In  Figure 7-3 , the S-300 curve shows the various combinations  of horizontal and vertical speeds that supply the required  energy to keep the rotor turning at a constant   $471~\mathrm{rpm}$  .  For example, an airspeed of   $54~\mathrm{mph}$   with a corresponding  vertical speed of 1,600 feet per minute (fpm) will provide  enough kinetic energy to maintain the rotor at a  $471\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . The  rotor does not care if the air is coming from the front or the  bottom so long as the total is sufficient to maintain the rpm.  Any point on the curve will maintain rotor speed. However,  the pilot does care because if he or she, for example, glides  at 30 knots, the corresponding rate of descent will be over 

  $_{2,200~\mathrm{fpm}}$  . Since there is little airspeed for a deceleration 

 (or “flare”) to reduce the rate of decent before touchdown,  the collective pitch application (increasing blade pitch and  giving a final temporary increase in lift before the blades  slow down) may be insufficient to arrest the rate of descent.  

Students who fully comprehend this relationship understand  why training autorotations are usually limited to airspeeds  between the minimum rate of descent airspeed and the  maximum range airspeed (usually about 25 percent faster  than the minimum rate of descent airspeed).  

Referencing a curve similar to the one shown in  Figure 7-3  is  useful to understand the consequences of not maintaining the  target airspeed when executing an autorotation. Simply put,  the pilot should know why airspeed is the most significant  factor affecting the rate of descent.  

# Hovering Performance  

Helicopter performance revolves around whether or not the  helicopter can be hovered. More power is required during the  hover than in any other flight regime. Obstructions aside, if  a hover can be maintained, a takeoff can be made, especially  with the additional benefit of translational lift. Hover charts  are provided for in ground effect (IGE) hover and out of  ground effect (OGE) hover under various conditions of  

![](images/5a741e5fe1b6e233388465c137dbd54020252be39ae85ca5569825998fccb77b.jpg)  
Figure 7-3.  An autorotation curve for the S-300 shows the various combinations of horizontal and vertical speeds that supply the required  energy to keep the rotor turning at a constant 471 rpm.  

gross weight, altitude, temperature, and power. The IGE  hover ceiling is usually higher than the OGE hover ceiling  because of the added lift benefit produced by ground effect.  See Chapter 2, Aerodynamics of Flight, for more details on  IGE and OGE hover. A pilot should always plan an OGE  hover when landing in an area that is uncertain or unverified. As density altitude increases, more power is required to  hover. At some point, the power required is equal to the  power available. This establishes the hovering ceiling under  the existing conditions. Any adjustment to the gross weight  by varying fuel, payload, or both, affects the hovering ceiling.  The heavier the gross weight, the lower the hovering ceiling.  As gross weight is decreased, the hover ceiling increases.  

# Sample Hover Problem 1  

You are to fly a photographer to a remote location to take  pictures of the local wildlife. Using  Figure 7-4 , can you  safely hover in ground effect at your departure point with  the following conditions?  

A. 	 Pressure Altitude................................8,000 feet B. 	 Temperature.........................................  $+15\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  C. 	 Takeoff Gross Weight.........................1,250 lb  

rpm..............................................104 percent  

First enter the chart at 8,000 feet pressure altitude (point A),  then move right until reaching a point mid­ way between the   $+10\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and  $+20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   lines (point B). From that point, proceed  down to find the maximum gross weight where a 2 foot  hover can be achieved. In this case, it is approximately 1,280  pounds (point C).  

Since the gross weight of your helicopter is less than this,  you can safely hover with these conditions.  

# Sample Hover Problem 2  

Once you reach the remote location in the previous problem,  you will need to hover OGE for some of the pictures. The  pressure altitude at the remote site is 9,000 feet, and you will  use 50 pounds of fuel getting there. (The new gross weight is  now 1,200 pounds.) The temperature will remain at  $+15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  Using  Figure 7-5 , can you accomplish the mission?  

Enter the chart at 9,000 feet (point A) and proceed to point  B   $(+15\mathrm{~}^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$  . From there, determine that the maxi­ mum gross

Figure 7-4.  In ground effect hovering ceiling versus gross weight  chart.  

weight to hover OGE is approximately 1,130 pounds (point  C). Since your gross weight is higher than this value, you will  not be able to hover in these conditions. To accomplish the  mission, you will need to remove approximately 70 pounds  before you begin the flight.  

These two sample problems emphasize the importance of  determining the gross weight and hover ceiling throughout  the entire flight operation. Being able to hover at the take­ off  location with a specific gross weight does not ensure the  same performance at the landing point. If the destination  point is at a higher density altitude because of higher  elevation, temperature, and/or relative humidity, more power  is required to hover there. You should be able to predict  whether hovering power will be available at the destination  by knowing the temperature and wind conditions, using  the performance charts in the helicopter flight manual, and  making certain power checks during hover and in flight prior  to commencing the approach and landing.

torque amounts for both engines.  

# Sample Hover Problem 3  

Using  Figure 7-6 , determine what torque is required to hover.  Use the following conditions:  

A.	 Pressure Altitude . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..9,500  feet B.	 Outside Air Temperature. .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  C.

First, enter the chart at 9,500 feet pressure altitude, then  move right to outside air temperature,  $0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . From that point,  move down to 4,250 pounds gross weight and then move left  to 5-foot skid height. Drop down to read 66 percent torque  required to hover.  

# Climb Performance  

For helicopters with dual engines, performance charts provide  

![](images/4ee7afda1deb043e3810663ef70577ddc8b8e56f50c964e63596d12677bda09c.jpg)  
Figure 7-6.  Torque required for cruise or level flight.  

Most of the factors affecting hover and takeoff per­ formance  also affect climb performance. In addition, turbulent air, pilot  techniques, and overall condition of the helicopter can cause  climb performance to vary.  

A helicopter flown at the best rate-of-climb speed  $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   obtains  the greatest gain in altitude over a given period of time. This  speed is normally used during the climb after all obstacles  have been cleared and is usu­ ally maintained until reaching  cruise altitude. Rate of climb must not be confused with angle  of climb. Angle of climb is a function of altitude gained over  a given distance. The  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$    results in the highest climb rate, but  not the steepest climb angle, and may not be sufficient to clear  obstructions. The best angle of climb speed   $\mathrm{(V_{X})}$   depends upon  the power available. If there is a surplus of power available,  

Wind direction and speed have an effect on climb  performance, but it is often misunderstood. Airspeed is  the speed at which the helicopter is moving through the  atmosphere and is unaffected by wind. Atmospheric wind  affects only the groundspeed, or speed at which the helicopter  is moving over the Earth’s surface. Thus, the only climb  performance affected by atmospheric wind is the angle of  climb and not the rate of climb.  

When planning for climb performance, it is first important to  plan for torque settings at level flight. Climb performance charts  show the change in torque, above or below torque, required  for level flight under the same gross weight and atmospheric  conditions to obtain a given rate of climb or descent.  

# Sample Cruise or Level Flight Problem  

Determine torque setting for cruise or level flight using  Figure 7-7.  Use the following conditions:  

![](images/fcdcca27d5925e575a147e9d4a6cf0dbc484f320d7dc54da22e91537349f4966.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.  Maximum rate-of-climb chart.  

Pressure Altitude............................................... 8,000 feet Outside Air Temperature......................................  $+15~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  A.	 Indicated Airspeed........................................80 knots B.	 Maximum Gross Weight................................5,000 lb  

With this chart, first confirm that it is for a pressure altitude  of 8,000 feet with an OAT of   $15^{\circ}$  . Begin on the left side  at 80 knots indicated airspeed (point A) and move right to  maximum gross weight of 5,000 lb (point B). From that point,  proceed down to the torque reading for level flight, which  is 74 percent torque (point C). This torque setting is used  in the next problem to add or subtract cruise/descent torque  percentage from cruise flight.  

# Sample Climb Problem

weight of 5,000 lb (point B). From that point, proceed down  to the torque percentage, which is 15 percent torque (point C).  For climb or descent, 15 percent torque should be added/ subtracted from the 74 percent torque needed for level flight.  For example, if the numbers were to be used for a climb  torque, the pilot would adjust torque settings to 89 percent  for optimal climb performance.

This chapter discussed the factors affecting performance:  density altitude, weight, and wind. Five sample problems  were also given with performance charts to calculate  different flight conditions and determine the performance  of the helicopter.  

# Ground Procedures and Flight  Preparations  

# Introduction  

Once a pilot takes off, it is up to him or her to make sound,  safe decisions throughout the flight. It is equally important  for the pilot to use the same diligence when conducting  a preflight inspection, making maintenance decisions,  refueling, and conducting ground operations. This chapter  discusses the responsibility of the pilot regarding ground  safety in and around the helicopter and when preparing to fly.  

# Preflight  

Before any flight, ensure the helicopter is airworthy by  inspecting it according to the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM),  pilot’s operating handbook (POH), or other information  supplied either by the operator or the manufacturer.  Remember that it is the responsibility of the pilot in command  (PIC) to ensure the aircraft is in an airworthy condition.  

In preparation for flight, the use of a checklist is important  so that no item is overlooked.  [Figure 8-1]  Follow the  manufacturer’s suggested outline for both the inside and  outside inspection. This ensures that all the items the  manufacturer feels are important are checked. If supplemental  equipment has been added to the helicopter, these procedures  should be included on the checklist as well.  

# Minimum Equipment Lists (MELs) and Operations  with Inoperative Equipment  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) requires  that all aircraft instruments and installed equipment be  operative prior to each departure. However, when the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) adopted the minimum  equipment list (MEL) concept for 14 CFR part 91 operations,  flights were allowed with inoperative items, as long as the  inoperative items were determined to be nonessential for safe  flight. At the same time, it allowed part 91 operators, without  an MEL, to defer repairs on nonessential equipment within  the guidelines of part 91.  

![](images/efebabb3e322dbe16447ad1d3f38b6e872c0307f85905a3b42f3b304a6c1f4a9.jpg)  
Figure 8-1.  The pilot in command is responsible for the airworthy  condition of the aircraft and using checklists to ensure proper  inspection of the helicopter prior to flight.  

There are two primary methods of deferring maintenance  on rotorcraft operating under part 91. They are the deferral  provision of 14 CFR part 91, section 91.213(d) and an FAA- approved MEL.  

The deferral provision of 14 CFR section 91.213(d) is  widely used by most pilot/operators. Its popularity is due  to simplicity and minimal paperwork. When inoperative  equipment is found during preflight or prior to departure, the  decision should be to cancel the flight, obtain maintenance  prior to flight, determine if the flight can be made under the  limitations imposed by the defective equipment, or to defer  the item or equipment.  

Maintenance deferrals are not used for in-flight discrepancies.  The manufacturer’s RFM/POH procedures are to be used in  those situations. The discussion that follows is an example of  a pilot who wishes to defer maintenance that would ordinarily  be required prior to flight.  

If able to use the deferral provision of 14 CFR section  91.213(d), the pilot determines whether the inoperative  equipment is required by type design or 14 CFR. If the  inoperative item is not required, and the helicopter can be  safely operated without it, the deferral may be made. The  inoperative item shall be deactivated or removed and an  INOPERATIVE placard placed near the appropriate switch,  control, or indicator. If deactivation or removal involves  maintenance (removal always does), it must be accomplished  by certificated maintenance personnel.  

For example, if the position lights (installed equipment) were  discovered to be inoperative prior to a daytime flight, the pilot  would follow the requirements of 14 CFR section 91.213(d).  The pilot must then decide if the flight can be accomplished  prior to night, when the lights will be needed.  

The deactivation may be a process as simple as the pilot  positioning a circuit breaker to the  off  position, or as complex  as rendering instruments or equipment totally inoperable.  Complex maintenance tasks require a certificated and  appropriately rated maintenance person to perform the  deactivation. In all cases, the item or equipment must be  placarded INOPERATIVE.  

When an operator requests an MEL, and a Letter of  Authorization (LOA) is issued by the FAA, then the use  of the MEL becomes mandatory for that helicopter. All  maintenance deferrals must be accomplished in accordance  with the terms and conditions of the MEL and the operator- generated procedures document.  

The use of an MEL for rotorcraft operated under part 91 also  allows for the deferral of inoperative items or equipment. The  primary guidance becomes the FAA-approved MEL issued  to that specific operator and N-numbered helicopter.  

The FAA has developed master minimum equipment lists  (MMELs) for rotorcraft in current use. Upon written request  by a rotorcraft operator, the local FAA Flight Standards  District Office (FSDO) may issue the appropriate make and  model MMEL, along with an LOA, and the preamble. The  operator then develops operations and maintenance (O&M)  procedures from the MMEL. This MMEL with O&M  procedures now becomes the operator’s MEL. The MEL,  LOA, preamble, and procedures document developed by the  operator must be on board the helicopter when it is operated.  

The FAA considers an approved MEL to be a supplemental  type certificate (STC) issued to an aircraft by serial number  and registration number. It therefore becomes the authority  to operate that aircraft in a condition other than originally  type certificated.  

With an approved MEL, if the position lights were discovered  inoperative prior to a daytime flight, the pilot would make  an entry in the maintenance record or discrepancy record  provided for that purpose. The item is then either repaired or  deferred in accordance with the MEL. Upon confirming that  daytime flight with inoperative position lights is acceptable in  accordance with the provisions of the MEL, the pilot would  leave the position lights switch  off , open the circuit breaker  (or whatever action is called for in the procedures document),  and placard the position light switch as INOPERATIVE.  

There are exceptions to the use of the MEL for deferral. For  example, should a component fail that is not listed in the  MEL as deferrable (the rotor tachometer, engine tachometer,  or cyclic trim, for example), then repairs are required to be  performed prior to departure. If maintenance or parts are not  readily available at that location, a special flight permit can  be obtained from the nearest FSDO. This permit allows the  helicopter to be flown to another location for maintenance.  This allows an aircraft that may not currently meet applicable  airworthiness requirements, but is capable of safe flight, to  be operated under the restrictive special terms and conditions  attached to the special flight permit.  

Deferral of maintenance is not to be taken lightly, and due  consideration should be given to the effect an inoperative  component may have on the operation of a helicopter,  particularly if other items are inoperative. Further information  regarding MELs and operations with inoperative equipment  can be found in AC 9 1-67, Minimum Equipment Requirements  for General Aviation Operations Under FAR Part 91.  

# Engine Start and Rotor Engagement  

During the engine start, rotor engagement, and systems  ground check, use the manufacturer’s checklists. If a problem  arises, have it checked before continuing. Prior to performing  these tasks, however, make sure the area around and above  the helicopter is clear of personnel and equipment. Position  the rotor blades so that they are not aligned with the fuselage.  This may prevent the engine from being started with the  blades still fastened. For a two-bladed rotor system, position  the blades so that they are perpendicular to the fuselage  and easily seen from the cockpit. Helicopters are safe and  efficient flying machines as long as they are operated within  the parameters established by the manufacturer.  

# Rotor Safety Considerations  

The exposed nature of the main and tail rotors deserves  special caution. Exercise extreme care when taxiing near  hangars or obstructions since the distance between the  rotor blade tips and obstructions is very difficult to judge.  [Figure 8-2]  In addition, the tail rotor of some helicopters  cannot be seen from the cabin. Therefore, when hovering  backward or turning in those helicopters, allow plenty of  room for tail rotor clearance. It is a good practice to glance  over your shoulder to maintain this clearance  

Another rotor safety consideration is the thrust a helicopter  generates. The main rotor system is capable of blowing sand,  dust, snow, ice, and water at high velocities for a significant  distance causing injury to nearby people and damage to  buildings, automobiles, and other aircraft. Loose snow, sand,  or soil can severely reduce visibility and obscure outside visual  references. There is also the possibility of sand and snow  being ingested into the engine intake, which can overwhelm  filters and cutoff air to the engine or allow unfiltered air into  the engine, leading to premature failure. Any airborne debris  near the helicopter can be ingested into the engine air intake  or struck by the main and tail rotor blades.

Figure 8-2.  Exercise extreme caution when hovering near buildings  or other aircraft.  

# Aircraft Servicing  

The helicopter rotor blades are usually stopped, and both the  aircraft and the refueling unit properly grounded prior to any  refueling operation. The pilot should ensure that the proper  grade of fuel and the proper additives, when required, are  being dispensed.  

Refueling of a turbine aircraft while the blades are turning,  known as “hot refueling,” may be practical for certain types  of operation. However, this can be hazardous if not properly  conducted. Pilots should remain at the flight controls; and  refueling personnel should be knowledgeable about the  proper refueling procedures and properly briefed for specific  helicopter makes and models.  

The pilot may need to train the refueling personnel on  proper hot refueling procedures for that specific helicopter.  The pilot should explain communication signs or calls,  normal servicing procedures, and emergency procedures as  a minimum. At all times during the refueling process, the  pilot should remain vigilant and ready to immediately shut  down the engine(s) and egress the aircraft. Several accidents  have occurred due to hot refueling performed by improperly  trained personnel.  

Refueling units should be positioned to ensure adequate  rotor blade clearance. Persons not involved with the  refueling operation should keep clear of the area. Smoking  must be prohibited in and around the aircraft during all  refueling operations.  

If operations dictate that the pilot must leave the helicopter  during refueling operations, the throttle should be rolled  back to flight idle and flight control friction firmly applied to  prevent uncommanded control movements. The pilot should  be thoroughly trained on setting the controls and egressing/ ingressing the helicopter.  

# Safety in and Around Helicopters  

People have been injured, some fatally, in helicopter accidents  that would not have occurred had they been informed of the  proper method of boarding or deplaning.  [Figure 8-3]  A  properly briefed passenger should never be endangered by  a spinning rotor. The simplest method of avoiding accidents  of this sort is to stop the rotors before passengers are boarded  or allowed to depart. Because this action is not always  practicable, and to realize the vast and unique capabilities  of the helicopter, it is often necessary to take on passengers  or have them exit the helicopter while the engine and rotors  are turning. To avoid accidents, it is essential that all persons  associated with helicopter operations, including passengers,  be made aware of all possible hazards and instructed how  those hazards can be avoided.  

# Ramp Attendants and Aircraft Servicing Personnel  

These personnel should be instructed as to their specific  duties and the proper method of fulfilling them. In addition,  the ramp attendant should be taught to:  

1. 	 Keep passengers and unauthorized persons out of the  helicopter landing and takeoff area. 2. 	 Brief passengers on the best way to approach and  board a helicopter with its rotors turning.  

Persons directly involved with boarding or deplaning  passengers, aircraft servicing, rigging, or hooking up external  loads, etc., should be instructed as to their duties. It would be  difficult, if not impossible, to cover each and every type of  operation related to helicopters. A few of the more obvious  and common ones are covered below.  

# Passengers  

Passengers increase the responsibility, workload, and risk for  the pilot. The workload and distractions seem magnified to  inexperienced pilots while they are developing confidence and  ability to operate in the aviation environment. Inexperienced  pilots should consider building up their passenger carrying  experience while remaining in good flying conditions and  in a familiar area.  

All persons boarding a helicopter while its rotors are turning  should be briefed on the safest means of doing so. The pilot  in command (PIC) should always brief the passengers prior  to engine start to ensure complete understanding of all  procedures. The exact procedures may vary slightly from  one helicopter model to another, but the following should  suffice as a generic guide.  

When boarding—  

1. 	 Stay away from the rear of the helicopter. 2. 	 Approach or leave the helicopter in a crouching manner. 3. 	 Approach from the side of the helicopter but never  out of the pilot’s line of vision. Certain rotor system  designs allow for rotor blades to pass closer to the  ground towards the front of the helicopter. For that  reason, it is generally accepted for personnel to  approach from the side of the helicopter. Helicopters  designed to be loaded from the rear require personnel  to exercise extreme caution due to tailrotor hazards. 4. 	 Carry tools horizontally, below waist level—never  upright or over the shoulder. 5. 	 Hold firmly onto hats and loose articles. 6. 	 Never reach up or dart after a hat or other object that  might be blown off or away. 7. 	 Protect eyes by shielding them with a hand or by  

# SAFETY  AROUND HELICOPTERS

squinting. 8. 	 If suddenly blinded by dust or a blowing object, stop  and crouch lower; better yet, sit down and wait for help. 9. 	 Never grope or feel your way toward or away from  the helicopter. 10.	 Protect hearing by wearing earplugs or earmuffs.  

Since few helicopters carry cabin attendants, the pilot must  conduct the pretakeoff and prelanding briefings, usually  before takeoff due to noise and cockpit layout. The type  of operation dictates what sort of briefing is necessary. All  briefings should include the following:  

1.	 Passengers should be briefed and understand the proper  use of seatbelts, doors, and headsets/intercom system. 2.	 The safe entry and exit paths (away from the tail rotor  and within the pilot’s view). 3.	 If possible, remove front passenger flight controls and  ensure all passenger personal items, such as cameras  and mobile phones are secure. 4.	 For over water flights, the location and use of flotation  gear and other survival equipment that are onboard.  Pilot instructions should include how and when to exit  the helicopter should ditching or a water landing occur. 5.	 For flights over rough or isolated terrain, the pilot  should brief all occupants regarding the location of  maps and survival equipment. 6.	 Passengers should be informed as to what actions and  precautions to take in the event of an emergency, such  as the body position for best spinal protection against  a high vertical impact (erect with back firmly against  the seat back); and when and how to exit. Ensure  that passengers are aware of the location of the fire  extinguisher, survival equipment and, if equipped,  how to use and locate the Emergency Position  Indicator Radio Beacon (EPIRB).  

operation can be extremely hazardous if a gust of wind  disturbs the rotor disk, or the collective flight control  moves causing lift to be generated by the rotor system.  Either occurrence may cause the helicopter to roll or pitch,  resulting in a rotor blade striking the tail boom or the  ground. Good operating procedures dictate that, generally,  pilots remain at the flight controls whenever the engine is  running, and the rotors are turning.  

If operations require the pilot to leave the cockpit to refuel,  the throttle should be rolled back to flight idle and all  controls firmly frictioned to prevent uncommanded control  movements. The pilot should be well trained on setting  controls and exiting the cockpit without disturbing the flight  or power controls.  

# After Landing and Securing  

When the flight is terminated, park the helicopter where  it does not interfere with other aircraft and is not a hazard  to people during shutdown. For many helicopters, it is  advantageous to land with the wind coming from the right  over the tail boom (counterrotating blades). This tends to  lift the blades over the tail boom but lowers the blades in  front of the helicopter. This action decreases the likelihood  of a main rotor strike to the tail boom due to gusty winds.  Rotor downwash can cause damage to other aircraft in close  proximity, and spectators may not realize the danger or see the  rotors turning. Passengers should remain in the helicopter with  their seats belts secured until the rotors have stopped turning.  During the shutdown and postflight inspection, follow the  manufacturer’s checklist. Any discrepancies should be noted  and, if necessary, reported to maintenance personnel.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter explained the importance of preflight and  safety when conducting helicopter ground operations. Proper  procedures for engine run-up, refueling, and ground safety  were detailed and the responsibilities of the pilot when  maintenance issues occur before flight.  

When passengers are approaching or leaving a helicopter  that is sitting on a slope with the rotors turning, they should  approach and depart downhill. This affords the greatest  distance between the rotor blades and the ground. If this  involves walking around the helicopter, they should always  go around the front—never the rear.  

# Pilot at the Flight Controls  

Many helicopter operators have been lured into a “quick  turnaround” ground operation to avoid delays at airport  terminals and to minimize stop/start cycles of the engine.  As part of this quick turn-around, the pilot might leave  the cockpit with the engine and rotors turning. Such an

# Basic Flight Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

From the previous chapters, it should be apparent that no  two helicopters perform the same way. Even when flying  the same model of helicopter, wind, temperature, humidity,  weight, and equipment make it difficult to predict just how  the helicopter will perform. Therefore, this chapter presents  the basic flight maneuvers in a way that would apply to  the majority of helicopters. In most cases, the techniques  described apply to small training helicopters with:  

•	 A single, main rotor rotating in a counterclock­ wise  direction (looking downward on the rotor).  

•	 An antitorque system.  

#  

Where a technique differs, it is noted. For example, a power  increase on a helicopter with a clockwise rotor system  requires right antitorque pedal pressure instead of left pedal  pressure. In many cases, the terminology “apply proper pedal  pressure” is used to indicate both types of rotor systems.  However, when discussing throt­ tle coordination to maintain  proper rotations per minute (rpm), there is no differentiation  between those helicopters with a gov­ ernor and those without.  In a sense, the governor is doing the work for you. In addition,  instead of using the terms “collective pitch control” and  “cyclic pitch control” throughout the chapter, these controls  are referred to as just “collective” and “cyclic.”  

Because helicopter performance varies with weather  conditions and aircraft loading, specific nose attitudes and  power settings are not detailed in this handbook. In addition,  this chapter does not detail every attitude of a helicopter in  the various flight maneuvers, nor every move that must be  made in order to perform a given maneuver.  

When a maneuver is presented, there is a brief description,  followed by the technique to accomplish the maneuver. In  most cases, there is a list of common errors at the end of the  discussion.  

# The Four Fundamentals  

There are four fundamentals of flight upon which all  maneuvers are based: straight-and-level flight, turns, climbs,  and descents. All controlled flight maneuvers consist of one  or more of these four fundamentals of flight. If a student pilot  is able to perform these maneuvers well, and the student’s  proficiency is based on accurate “feel” and control analysis  rather than mechanical movements, the ability to perform  any assigned maneuver is only a matter of obtaining a clear  visual and mental conception of it. The flight instructor must  impart a good knowledge of these basic elements to the  student and must combine them and plan their practice so that  proper performance of each is instinctive without conscious  effort. The importance of this to the success of flight training  cannot be overemphasized. As the student progresses to  more complex maneuvers, discounting any difficulties in  visualizing the maneuvers, most student difficulties are  caused by a lack of training, practice, or understanding of the  principles of one or more of these fundamentals.  

# Guidelines  

Good practices to follow during maneuvering flight include:  

1. 	 Move the cyclic only as fast as trim, torque, and rotor  speed can be maintained. When entering a maneuver  and the trim, rotor, or torque reacts quicker than  anticipated, pilot limitations have been exceeded. If  continued, an aircraft limitation will be exceeded.  

Perform the maneuver with less intensity until all  aspects of the machine can be controlled. The pilot  must be aware of the sensitivity of the flight controls  due to the high speed of the main rotor.  

2. 	 Anticipate changes in aircraft performance due to  loading or environmental condition. The normal  collective increase to check rotor speed at sea level  standard (SLS) may not be sufficient at 4,000 feet  pressure altitude (PA) and   $95~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  .  

3. 	 The following flight characteristics may be expected  during maneuvering flight and will be discussed and  demonstrated by your Flight Instructor:  

•	 Left turns, torque increases (more antitorque).  This applies to most helicopters, but not all. •	 Right turns, torque decreases (less antitorque).  This applies to most helicopters, but not all. •	 Application of aft cyclic, torque decreases and  rotor speed increases.  •	 Application of forward cyclic (especially when  immediately following aft cyclic application),  torque increases and rotor speed decreases.  •	 Always leave a way out.  •	 Know where the winds are.  •	 Engine failures can occur during power changes  and cruise flight. One possible cause of engine  failure during cruise flight can be attributed to the  pilot ignoring carburetor air temperatures, which  could lead to carburetor icing and, subsequently,  engine failure. •	 Crew coordination is critical. Everyone needs  to be fully aware of what is going on, and each  crewmember has a specific duty.  •	 In steep turns, the nose drops. In most cases,  energy (airspeed) must be traded to maintain  altitude as the required excess engine power may  not be available (to maintain airspeed in a  $2\mathrm{G}/60^{\circ}$    turn, rotor thrust/engine power must increase by  100 percent). Failure to anticipate this at low  altitude endangers the crew and passengers.  The rate of pitch change is proportional to gross  weight and density altitude.  •	 Normal helicopter landings usually require high  power settings, with terminations to a hover  requiring the highest power setting. •	 The cyclic position relative to the horizon  determines the helicopter’s travel and attitude.  

# Straight-and-Level Flight  

Straight-and-level flight is flight in which constant altitude  and heading are maintained. The attitude of the rotor disk  relative to the horizon determines the airspeed. The horizontal  stabilizer design determines the helicopter’s attitude when  stabilized at an airspeed and altitude. Altitude is primarily  controlled by use of the collective.  

# Technique  

To maintain forward flight, the rotor tip-path plane must  be tilted forward to obtain the necessary horizontal thrust  component from the main rotor. By doing this, it causes the  nose of the helicopter to lower which in turn will cause the  airspeed to increase. In order to counteract this, the pilot  must find the correct power setting to maintain level flight by  adjusting the collective.  [Figure 9-1]  The horizontal stabilizer  aids in trimming the helicopter about its transverse, horizontal  axis, and reduces the amount of nose tuck that would occur.  On several helicopters, it is designed as a negative lift airfoil,  which produces a lifting force in a downward direction.  

When in straight-and-level flight, any increase in the  collective, while holding airspeed constant, causes the  helicopter to climb. A decrease in the collective, while holding  airspeed constant, causes the helicopter to descend. A change  in the collective requires a coordi­ nated change of the throttle  to maintain a constant rpm. Additionally, the antitorque pedals  need to keep the helicopter in trim around the vertical axis.  

To increase airspeed in straight-and-level flight, apply  forward pressure on the cyclic and raise the collective as  necessary to maintain altitude. To decrease airspeed, apply  rearward pressure on the cyclic and lower the collective, as  necessary, to maintain altitude.  

![](images/351d0f3db83ace114f7e4baa074e7e884fee5e47eb68da5b515c12ed4d201d8d.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.  Maintain straight-and-level flight by adjusting the rotor  tip-path plane forward but adjusting the collective as necessary to  maintain a constant airspeed and altitude. The natural horizon line  can be used as an aid in maintaining straight-and-level flight. If  the horizon line begins to rise, slight power may be required or the  nose of the helicopter may be too low. If the horizon line is slowly  dropping, some power may need to be taken out or the nose of the  helicopter may be too high, requiring a cyclic adjustment.  

Although the cyclic is sensitive, there is a slight delay in  control reaction, and it is necessary to antici­ pate actual  movement of the helicopter. When making cyclic inputs to  control the altitude or airspeed of a hel­ icopter, take care not  to overcontrol. If the nose of the helicopter rises above the  level-flight attitude, apply forward pressure to the cyclic to  bring the nose down. If this correction is held too long, the  nose drops too low. Since the helicopter continues to change  attitude momentarily after the controls reach neutral, return  the cyclic to neutral slightly before the desired attitude is  reached. This principle holds true for any cyclic input.  

Since helicopters are not very stable, but are inherently very  controllable, if a gust or turbulence causes the nose to drop,  the nose tends to continue to drop instead of returning to a  straight-and-level attitude as it would on a fixed-wing aircraft.  Therefore, a pilot must remain alert and fly the helicop­ ter  at all times.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to trim the helicopter properly, tending to hold  antitorque pedal pressure and opposite cyclic. This is  commonly called cross-controlling. 2.	 Failure to maintain desired airspeed. 3. 	 Failure to hold proper control position to main­ tain  desired ground track. 4.	 Failure to allow helicopter to stabilize at new airspeed.  

# Turns  

A turn is a maneuver used to change the heading of the  helicopter. The aerodynamics of a turn were previously  discussed in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics of Flight.  

# Technique  

Before beginning any turn, the area in the direction of the  turn must be cleared not only at the helicopter’s alti­ tude, but  also above and below. To enter a turn from straight-and-level  flight, apply sideward pressure on the cyclic in the direction  the turn is to be made. This is the only control movement  needed to start the turn. Do not use the pedals to assist the  turn. Use the pedals only to compensate for torque to keep  the helicopter in trim around the vertical axis.  [Figure 9-2] Keeping the fuselage in the correct streamlined position  around the vertical axis facilitates the helicopter flying  forward with the least drag.   Trim is indicated by a yaw string  in the center, or a centered ball on a turn and slip indicator. A  yaw string (also referred to as a slip string) is a tool used to  indicate slip or skid during flight. It is simply a string attached  to the nose or canopy of an aircraft so that it is visible to the  pilot during flight. The string measures sideslip and offers  a visual cue to the pilot in order to make yaw corrections.  

![](images/5e1aae4ad7d29b8cdb35f52acf7753422657619e91ae9f990d4ac03ed471c70e.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.  During a level, coordinated turn, the rate of turn  is commensurate with the angle of bank used, and inertia and  horizontal component of lift (HCL) are equal.  

How fast the helicopter banks depends on how much lateral  cyclic pressure is applied. How far the helicop­ ter banks (the  steepness of the bank) depends on how long the cyclic is  displaced. After establishing the proper bank angle, return  the cyclic toward the neutral position. When the bank is  established, returning the cyclic to neutral (or holding it  inclined relative to the horizon) will maintain the helicopter  at that bank angle. Increase the collective and throttle to  maintain altitude and rpm. As the torque increases, increase  the proper antitorque pedal pressure to maintain longi­ tudinal  trim. Depending on the degree of bank, addi­ tional forward  cyclic pressure may be required to maintain airspeed.  

Rolling out of the turn to straight-and-level flight is the same  as the entry into the turn, except that pressure on the cyclic  is applied in the opposite direction. Since the helicopter  continues to turn as long as there is any bank, start the rollout  before reaching the desired heading.  

The discussion on level turns is equally applicable to making  turns while climbing or descending. The only difference is  that the helicopter is in a climbing or descending attitude  rather than that of level flight. If a so-called simultaneous  entry (entering a turn while, at the same time, climbing or  descending) is desired, merely combine the techniques of  both maneuvers—climb or descent entry and turn entry.  When recovering from a climbing or descending turn, the  desired heading and altitude are rarely reached at the same  time. If the heading is reached first, stop the turn and maintain  the climb or descent until reaching the desired altitude. On the  other hand, if the altitude is reached first, establish the level  flight attitude and continue the turn to the desired heading.  

# Slips  

A slip occurs when the helicopter slides sideways toward the  center of the turn.  [Figure 9-3]  It is caused by an insufficient  amount of antitorque pedal in the direction of the turn,  or too much in the direction oppo­ site the turn, in relation  to the amount of power used. In other words, if you hold  improper antitorque pedal pres­ sure, which keeps the nose  from following the turn, the helicopter slips sideways toward  the center of the turn.  

# Skids  

A skid occurs when the helicopter slides sideways away from  the center of the turn.  [Figure 9-4]  It is caused by too much  antitorque pedal pressure in the direction of the turn, or by  too little in the direction opposite the turn in relation to the  amount of power used. If the helicopter is forced to turn faster  with increased pedal pressure instead of by increasing the  degree of the bank, it skids sideways away from the center  of the turn instead of flying in its normal curved path.  

In summary, a skid occurs when the rate of turn is too great  for the amount of bank being used, and a slip occurs when  the rate of turn is too low for the amount of bank being used.  [Figure 9-5]

# Normal Climb  

The entry into a climb from a hover has already been described  in the Normal Takeoff from a Hover subsection; there­ fore,  this discussion is limited to a climb entry from cruising flight.  

# Technique  

To enter a climb in a helicopter while maintaining airspeed,  the first actions are increasing the collective and throttle,  and adjusting the pedals as necessary to maintain a centered  ball in the slip/skid indicator. Moving the collective up  requires a slight aft movement of the cyclic to direct all  of the increased power into lift and maintain the airspeed.  Remember, a helicopter can climb with the nose down and  descend with the nose up. Helicopter attitude changes mainly  reflect acceleration or deceleration, not climb or descent.  Therefore, the climb attitude is approximately the same as  level flight in a stable climb, depending on the aircraft’s  horizontal stabilizer design.  

If the pilot wishes to climb faster, with a decreased airspeed,  then the climb can be initiated with aft cyclic. Depending  on initial or entry airspeed for the climb, the climb can be  accomplished without increasing the collective, if a much  slower airspeed is acceptable. However, as the airspeed  decreases, the airflow over the vertical fin decreases  necessitating more antitorque (left) pedal application.  

To level off from a climb, start adjusting the attitude to the  level flight attitude a few feet prior to reaching the desired  altitude. The amount of lead depends on the rate of climb at  the time of level-off (the higher the rate of climb, the more  the lead). Generally, the lead is 10 percent of the climb rate.  For example, if the climb rate is 500 feet per minute (fpm),  you should lead the level-off by 50 feet.  

To begin the level-off, apply forward cyclic to adjust and  maintain a level flight attitude, which can be slightly nose  low. Maintain climb power until the airspeed approaches the  desired cruising airspeed, then lower the collective to obtain  cruising power and adjust the throttle to obtain and maintain  cruising rpm. Throughout the level-off, maintain longitudinal  trim with the antitorque pedals.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to maintain proper power and airspeed. 2.	 Holding too much or too little antitorque pedal. 3.	 In the level-off, decreasing power before adjusting the  nose to cruising attitude.  

# Normal Descent  

A normal descent is a maneuver in which the helicop­ ter loses  altitude at a controlled rate in a controlled attitude.  

# Technique  

To establish a normal descent from straight-and-level flight  at cruising airspeed, lower the collective to obtain proper  power, adjust the throttle to maintain rpm, and increase  right antitorque pedal pressure to maintain heading in a  counterclockwise rotor system (or left pedal pressure in a  clockwise system). If cruising airspeed is the same as or  slightly above descending air­ speed, simultaneously apply  the necessary cyclic pressure to obtain the approximate  descending attitude. If the pilot wants to decelerate, the  cyclic must be moved aft. If the pilot desires to descend with  increased airspeed, then forward cyclic is all that is required if  airspeed remains under the limit. As the helicopter stabilizes  at any forward airspeed, the fuselage attitude will streamline  due to the airflow over the horizontal stabilizer. As the  airspeed changes, the airflow over the vertical stabilizer or  fin changes, so the pedals must be adjusted for trim.  

The pilot should always remember that the total lift and thrust  vectoring is controlled by the cyclic. If a certain airspeed  is desired, it will require a certain amount of cyclic and  collective movement for level flight. If the cyclic is moved,  the thrust-versus-lift ratio is changed. Aft cyclic directs  more power to lift, and altitude increases. Forward cyclic  directs more power to thrust, and airspeed increases. If the  collective is not changed and there is a change only in cyclic,  the total thrust to lift ratio does not change: aft cyclic results  in a climb, and forward cyclic results in a descent with the  corresponding airspeed changes.  

To level off from the descent, lead the desired altitude  by approximately 10 percent of the rate of descent. For  example, a 500-fpm rate of descent would require a 50-foot  lead. At this point, increase the collective to obtain cruising  power, adjust the throttle to maintain rpm, and increase left  antitorque pedal pressure to maintain heading (right pedal  pressure in a clockwise rotor system). Adjust the cyclic to  obtain cruising airspeed and a level flight atti­ tude as the  desired altitude is reached.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to maintain constant angle of decent dur­ ing  training.  2.	 Failure to level-off the aircraft sufficiently, which  results in recovery below the desired altitude. 3.	 Failure to adjust antitorque pedal pressures for changes  in power.  

# Vertical Takeoff to a Hover  

A vertical takeoff to a hover involves flying the helicopter  from the ground vertically to a skid height of two to three  feet, while maintaining a constant heading. Once the desired  skid height is achieved, the helicopter should remain nearly  motionless over a reference point at a constant altitude and  on a constant heading. The maneuver requires a high degree  of concentration and coordination.  

# Technique  

The pilot on the controls needs to clear the area left, right,  and above to perform a vertical takeoff to a hover. The  pilot should remain focused outside the aircraft and obtain  clearance to take off from the controlling tower. If necessary,  the pilot who is not on the controls assists in clearing the  aircraft and provides adequate warning of any obstacles and  any unannounced or unusual drift/altitude changes.  

Heading control, direction of turn, and rate of turn at hover  are all controlled by using the pedals. Hover height, rate of  ascent, and the rate of descent are controlled by using the  collective. Helicopter position and the direction of travel are  controlled by the cyclic.  

After receiving the proper clearance and ensuring that the  area is clear of obstacles and traffic, begin the maneuver with  the collective in the down position and the cyclic in a neutral  position, or slightly into the wind. Very slowly increase the  collective until the helicopter becomes light on the skids or  wheels. As collective and torque increases, antitorque must  be adjusted as well. Therefore, as the aircraft begins to get  light on the landing gear, apply appropriate antitorque pedal  to maintain aircraft heading. Continue to apply pedals as  necessary to maintain heading and coordinate the cyclic for  a vertical ascent. As the helicopter slowly leaves the ground,  check for proper attitude control response and helicopter  center of gravity. A slow ascent will allow stopping if  responses are outside the normal parameters indicating hung  or entangled landing gear, center of gravity problems, or  control issues. If a roll or tilt begin, decrease the collective  and determine the cause of the roll or tilt. Upon reaching the  desired hover altitude, adjust the flight controls as necessary  to maintain position over the intended hover area. Student  pilots should be reminded that while at a hover, the helicopter  is rarely ever level. Helicopters usually hover left side low  due to the tail rotor thrust being counteracted by the main  rotor tilt. A nose low or high condition is generally caused  by loading. Once stabilized, check the engine instruments  and note the power required to hover.  

Excessive movement of any flight control requires a change  in the other flight controls. For example, if the helicopter  drifts to one side while hovering, the pilot naturally moves  the cyclic in the opposite direction. When this is done,  part of the vertical thrust is diverted, resulting in a loss of  altitude. To maintain altitude, increase the collective. This  increases drag on the blades and tends to slow them down. To  counteract the drag and maintain rpm, increase the throttle.  Increased throttle means increased torque, so the pilot must  add more pedal pressure to maintain the heading. This can  easily lead to overcontrolling the helicopter. However, as  level of proficiency increases, prob­ lems associated with  overcontrolling decrease. Helicopter controls are usually  more driven by pressure than by gross control movements.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to ascend vertically as the helicopter becomes  airborne. 2.	 Pulling excessive collective to become airborne,  causing the helicopter to gain too much altitude. 3.	 Overcontrolling the antitorque pedals, which not only  changes the heading of the helicopter, but also changes  the rpm.  

4.	 Reducing throttle rapidly in situations in which  proper rpm has been exceeded, usually resulting in  exaggerated heading changes and loss of lift, resulting  in loss of altitude.  

5.	 Failing to ascend slowly.  

# Hovering  

A stationary hover is a maneuver in which the helicopter is  main­ tained in nearly motionless flight over a reference point  at a constant altitude and on a constant heading.  

# Technique  

To maintain a hover over a point, use sideview and peripheral  vision to look for small changes in the helicopter’s attitude  and altitude. When these changes are noted, make the  necessary con­ trol inputs before the helicopter starts to  move from the point. To detect small variations in altitude  or position, the main area of visual attention needs to be  some distance from the aircraft, using various points on the  helicopter or the tip-path plane as a reference. Looking too  closely or looking down leads to overcontrolling. Obviously,  in order to remain over a certain point, know where the point  is, but do not focus all attention there.  

As with a takeoff, the pilot controls altitude with the collec­ tive and maintains a constant rpm with the throttle. The cyclic  is used to maintain the helicopter’s position; the pedals, to  control heading. To maintain the helicopter in a stabilized  hover, make small, smooth, coordinated corrections. As the  desired effect occurs, remove the correction in order to stop the  helicopter’s movement. For example, if the helicopter begins  to move rearward, apply a small amount of forward cyclic  pressure. However, neutralize this pres­ sure just before the  helicopter comes to a stop, or it will begin to move forward.  

After experience is gained, a pilot develops a certain “feel”  for the helicopter. Small deviations can be felt and seen,  so you can make the corrections before the helicopter  actually moves. A certain relaxed looseness develops, and  controlling the helicopter becomes sec­ ond nature, rather than  a mechanical response.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Tenseness and slow reactions to movements of the  helicopter. 2.	 Failure to allow for lag in cyclic and collective pitch,  which leads to overcontrolling. It is very common for  a student to get ahead of the helicopter. Due to inertia,  it requires some small time period for the helicopter  to respond.  

3.	 Confusing attitude changes for altitude changes, which  results in improper use of the controls. 4. 	 Hovering too high, creating a hazardous flight  condition. The height velocity chart should be  referenced to determine the maximum skid height  to hover and safely recover the helicopter should a  malfunction occur. 5. 	 Hovering too low, resulting in occasional touch­ down. 6.	 Becoming overly confident over prepared surfaces  when taking off to a hover. Be aware that dynamic  rollover accidents usually occur over a level surface.  

# Hovering Turn  

A hovering turn is a maneuver performed at hovering height  in which the nose of the helicopter is rotated either left or  right while maintaining position over a reference point on the  surface. Hovering turns can also be made around the mast or  tail of the aircraft. The maneuver requires the coordination  of all flight controls and demands pre­ cise control near the  surface. A pilot should maintain a constant altitude, rate of  turn, and rpm.  

# Technique  

Initiate the turn in either direction by applying anti-torque  pedal pressure toward the desired direction. It should be noted  that during a turn to the left, more power is required because  left pedal pressure increases the pitch angle of the tail rotor,  which, in turn, requires additional power from the engine. A  turn to the right requires less power. (On helicopters with a  clock­ wise rotating main rotor, right pedal increases the pitch  angle and, therefore, requires more power.)  

As the turn begins, use the cyclic as necessary (usually into  the wind) to keep the helicopter over the desired spot. To  continue the turn, add more pedal pressure as the helicopter  turns to the cross­ wind position. This is because the wind is  striking the tail surface and tail rotor area, making it more  difficult for the tail to turn into the wind. As pedal pressures  increase due to crosswind forces, increase the cyclic pressure  into the wind to maintain position. Use the collective with the  throttle to maintain a constant altitude and rpm.  [Figure 9-6]  

After the   $90°$   portion of the turn, decrease pedal pressure  slightly to maintain the same rate of turn. Approaching the   $180^{\circ}$  , or downwind portion, anticipate opposite pedal pressure  due to the tail moving from an upwind position to a down­ wind position. At this point, the rate of turn has a ten­ dency  to increase at a rapid rate due to the tendency of the tail  surfaces to weathervane. Because of the tailwind condition,  

![](images/f5f0d754510e3fd83859aec1aa9e0d51203394415e9709bf900483230f1e0d47.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.  Left turns in helicopters with a counterclockwise rotating main rotor are more difficult to execute because the tail rotor  demands more power. This requires you to compensate with additional left pedal and increased throttle. Refer to this graphic throughout  the remainder of the discussion on a hovering turn to the left.  

hold rearward cyclic pressure to keep the helicopter over  the same spot.  

The horizontal stabilizer has a tendency to lift the tail during  a tailwind condition. This is the most difficult portion of  the hovering turn. Horizontal and vertical stabilizers have  several different designs and locations, including the canted  stabilizers used on some Hughes and Schweizer helicopters.  The primary purpose of the vertical stabilizer is to unload  the work of the antitorque system and to aid in trimming the  helicopter in flight should the antitorque system fail. The  horizontal stabilizer provides for a more usable CG range  and aids in trimming the helicopter longitudinally.  

Because of the helicopter’s tendency to weathervane,  maintaining the same rate of turn from the   $180^{\circ}$   posi­ tion  actually requires some pedal pressure opposite the direction  of turn. If a pilot does not apply opposite pedal pressure,  the helicopter tends to turn at a faster rate. The amount of  pedal pressure and cyclic deflection throughout the turn  depends on the wind velocity. As the turn is finished on the  upwind heading, apply opposite pedal pressure to stop the  turn. Gradually apply forward cyclic pressure to keep the  helicopter from drifting.  

Control pressures and direction of application change  continuously throughout the turn. The most dramatic change  is the pedal pressure (and corresponding power requirement)  necessary to control the rate of turn as the helicopter moves  through the downwind portion of the maneuver.  

Turns can be made in either direction; however, in a high  wind condition, the tail rotor may not be able to produce  enough thrust, which means the pilot cannot control a turn  to the right in a counterclockwise rotor system. Therefore,  if control is ever question­ able, first attempt to make a  $90°$  turn to the left. If sufficient tail rotor thrust exists to turn  the helicopter crosswind in a left turn, a right turn can be  successfully controlled. The opposite applies to helicopters  with clockwise rotor systems. In this case, start the turn to  the right. Hovering turns should be avoided in winds strong  enough to preclude sufficient aft cyclic control to maintain  the helicopter on the selected surface reference point  when headed downwind. Check the flight manual for the  manufacturer’s recom­ mendations for this limitation.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to maintain a slow, constant rate of turn. 2.	 Failing to maintain position over the reference point. 3.	 Failing to maintain rpm within normal range. 4.	 Failing to maintain constant altitude. 5. 	 Failing to use the antitorque pedals properly.  

# Hovering—Forward Flight  

Forward hovering flight is normally used to move a helicopter  to a specific location, and it may begin from a stationary  hover. During the maneuver, constant groundspeed, altitude,  and heading should be maintained.  

# Technique  

Before starting, pick out two references directly in front and  in line with the helicopter. These reference points should be  kept in line throughout the maneuver.  [Figure 9-7]  

Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering height by  applying forward pressure on the cyclic. As movement  begins, return the cyclic toward the neutral position to  maintain low groundspeed—no faster than a brisk walk.  Throughout the maneuver, maintain a constant groundspeed  and path over the ground with the cyclic, a constant heading  with the antitorque pedals, altitude with the collective, and  the proper rpm with the throttle.  

To stop the forward movement, apply rearward cyclic  pressure until the helicopter stops. As forward motion stops,  return the cyclic to the neutral position to pre­ vent rearward  movement. Forward movement can also be stopped by  simply applying rearward pressure to level the helicopter  and allowing it to drift to a stop.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Exaggerated movement of the cyclic, resulting in  erratic movement over the surface.  

![](images/11322ac8aa489c62551c02cdf775ec6dd2ff13e9f99c30a66052a7612866407e.jpg)  
Figure 9-7.  To maintain a straight ground track, use two reference  points in line and at some distance in front of the helicopter.  

2.	 Failure to use proper antitorque pedal control, resulting  in excessive heading change. 3.	 Failure to maintain desired hovering height. 4.	 Failure to maintain proper rpm. 5.	 Failure to maintain alignment with direction of travel.  

# Hovering—Sideward Flight  

Sideward hovering flight may be necessary to move the  helicopter to a specific area when conditions make it  impossible to use forward flight. During the maneu­ ver,  a constant groundspeed, altitude, and heading should be  maintained.  

# Technique  

Before starting sideward hovering flight, ensure the area  for the hover is clear, especially at the tail rotor. Constantly  monitor hover height and tail rotor clearance during all  hovering maneuvers to prevent dynamic rollover or tail  rotor strikes to the ground. Then, pick two points of in-line  reference in the direction of sideward hovering flight to help  maintain the proper ground track. These reference points  should be kept in line throughout the maneuver.  [Figure 9-8]  

Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering height by  applying cyclic toward the side in which the movement is  desired. As the movement begins, return the cyclic toward the  neutral position to maintain low groundspeed—no faster than  a brisk walk. Throughout the maneuver, maintain a constant  groundspeed and ground track with cyclic. Maintain heading,  

![](images/76770ea23babaded91cd2bcad66f96b4ac4e42974661149b5691299c40eca513.jpg)  
Figure 9-8.   The key to hovering sideward is establishing at least  two reference points that help maintain a straight track over the  ground while keeping a constant heading.  

which in this maneuver is perpendicular to the ground track,  with the antitorque pedals, and a constant altitude with the  collective. Use the throttle to maintain the proper operating  rpm. Be aware that the nose tends to weathervane into the  wind. Changes in the pedal position will change the rpm  and must be corrected by collective and/or throttle changes  to maintain altitude.  

To stop the sideward movement, apply cyclic pres­ sure in  the direction opposite to that of movement and hold it until  the helicopter stops. As motion stops, return the cyclic to  the neutral position to prevent movement in the opposite  direction. Applying sufficient opposite cyclic pressure to  level the helicopter may also stop sideward move­ ment. The  helicopter then drifts to a stop.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Exaggerated movement of the cyclic, resulting in  overcontrolling and erratic movement over the surface. 2.	 Failure to use proper antitorque pedal control, resulting  in excessive heading change. 3.	 Failure to maintain desired hovering height. 4.	 Failure to maintain proper rpm. 5.	 Failure to make sure the area is clear prior to starting  the maneuver.  

# Hovering—Rearward Flight  

Rearward hovering flight may be necessary to move the  helicopter to a specific area when the situation is such that  forward or sideward hovering flight cannot be used. During  the maneuver, maintain a constant groundspeed, altitude, and  heading. Due to the limited visibility behind a helicopter, it  is important that the area behind the helicopter be cleared  before beginning the maneuver. Use of ground personnel is  rec­ ommended.  

# Technique  

Before starting rearward hovering flight, pick out two  reference points in front of, and in line with the heli­ copter  just like hovering for­ ward.  [Figure 9-7]  The movement of  the helicopter should be such that these points remain in line.  

Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering height  by applying rearward pressure on the cyclic. After the  movement has begun, position the cyclic to maintain a slow  groundspeed—no faster than a brisk walk. Throughout the  maneuver, maintain constant ground­ speed and ground track  with the cyclic, a constant heading with the antitorque pedals,  constant altitude with the collective, and the proper rpm with  the throttle.  

To stop the rearward movement, apply forward cyclic and  hold it until the helicopter stops. As the motion stops, return  the cyclic to the neutral position. Also, as in the case of  forward and sideward hovering flight, opposite cyclic can  be used to level the helicopter and let it drift to a stop. Tail  rotor clearance must be maintained. Generally, a higher-than- normal hover altitude is preferred.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Exaggerated movement of the cyclic resulting in  overcontrolling and an uneven movement over the  surface. 2.	 Failure to use proper antitorque pedal control, resulting  in excessive heading change. 3.	 Failure to maintain desired hovering height. 4.	 Failure to maintain proper rpm. 5. 	 Failure to make sure the area is clear prior to starting  the maneuver.  

# Taxiing  

Taxiing refers to operations on or near the surface of taxiways  or other prescribed routes. Helicopters utilize three different  types of taxiing.  

# Hover Taxi  

A hover taxi is used when operating below 25 feet above  ground level (AGL).  [Figure 9-9]  Since hover taxi is just like  forward, sideward, or rearward hovering flight, the technique  to perform it is not presented here.  

# Air Taxi  

An air taxi is preferred when movements require greater  distances within an airport or heliport bound­ ary.  [Figure 9-10]   In this case, fly to the new location; however, it is expected  that the helicopter will remain below 100 feet AGL with  an appropriate airspeed and will avoid over flight of other  aircraft, vehicles, and personnel.  

![](images/d7626e3c02e19962fc69981a5b4117143031c3edd51ecf19f350bd8f7f75d5ff.jpg)

Figure 9-10.  Air taxi.  

# Technique  

Before starting, determine the appropriate airspeed and  altitude combination to remain out of the cross-hatched or  shaded areas of the height/velocity diagram (see  Figure 7-1 ).  Additionally, be aware of crosswind conditions that could  lead to loss of tail rotor effectiveness. Pick out two references  directly in front of the helicopter for the ground path desired.  These reference points should be kept in line throughout the  maneuver.  

Begin the maneuver from a normal hovering height by  applying forward pressure on the cyclic. As move­ ment  begins, attain the desired airspeed with the cyclic. Control the  desired altitude with the collective and rpm with the throttle.  Throughout the maneuver, maintain a desired groundspeed  and ground track with the cyclic, a constant heading with  antitorque pedals, the desired altitude with the collective,  and proper operating rpm with the throttle.  

To stop the forward movement, apply aft cyclic pressure to  reduce forward speed. Simultaneously lower the col­ lective to  initiate a descent to hover altitude. As forward motion stops,  return the cyclic to the neutral posi­ tion to prevent rearward  movement. As approaching the proper hover altitude, increase  the collective as necessary to stop descent at hover altitude  (much like a quick stop maneuver (see page 10-4)).  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Erratic movement of the cyclic, resulting in improper  airspeed control and erratic movement over the  surface. 2.	 Failure to use proper antitorque pedal control, result­ ing  in excessive heading change. 3.	 Failure to maintain desired altitude. 4.	 Failure to maintain proper rpm. 5.	 Overflying parked aircraft causing possible dam­ age  from rotor downwash.  

6.	 Flying in the cross-hatched or shaded area of the  height/velocity diagram. 7.	 Flying in a crosswind that could lead to loss of tail  rotor effectiveness. 8.	 Excessive tail-low attitudes. 9.	 Excessive power used or required to stop. 10.	 Failure to maintain alignment with direction of travel.  

# Surface Taxi  

A surface taxi is used to minimize the effects of rotor  downwash in wheel-type helicopters.  [Figure 9-11]  Surface  taxiing in skid type helicopters is generally not recommended  due to the high risk of dynamic rollover; for more information,  refer to Chapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards.  

# Technique  

The helicopter should be in a stationary position on the surface  with the collective full down and the rpm the same as that  used for a hover. This rpm should be maintained throughout  the maneuver. Then, move the cyclic slightly forward and  apply gradual upward pres­ sure on the collective to move  the helicopter forward along the surface. Use the antitorque  pedals to maintain heading and the cyclic to maintain ground  track. The collective controls starting, stopping, and speed  while taxiing. The higher the collective pitch, the faster the  taxi speed; however, do not taxi faster than a brisk walk. If  the helicopter is equipped with brakes, use them to help slow  down. Do not use the cyclic to control groundspeed.  

During a crosswind taxi, hold the cyclic into the wind a  sufficient amount to eliminate any drifting movement.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Improper use of cyclic. 2.	 Failure to use antitorque pedals for heading control.  

![](images/23273785ff30e87133b82005d35f506fd2b3c662a6aa029c2f2258fbf3bf48c4.jpg)  
Figure 9-11.  Surface taxi.  

3.	 Improper use of the controls during crosswind  operations.  

4.	 Failure to maintain proper rpm.  

# Normal Takeoff from a Hover  

A normal takeoff from a hover is an orderly transition to  forward flight and is executed to increase altitude safely and  expeditiously. Before initiating a takeoff, the pilot should  ensure that the proper checklist has been completed and  the helicopter systems are within normal limits. During the  takeoff, fly a pro­ file that avoids the cross-hatched or shaded  areas of the height/velocity diagram.  

# Technique  

Refer to  Figure 9-12  (position 1). Bring the helicopter to a  hover and perform a hover and systems check, which includes  power, balance, and flight controls prior to continuing flight.  The power check should include an evaluation of the amount  of excess power available; that is, the difference between the  power being used to hover and the power available at the  existing altitude and temperature conditions. The balance  condition of the helicopter is indicated by the position  of the cyclic when maintaining a stationary hover. Wind  necessitates some cyclic deflection, but there should not be  an extreme deviation from neutral. Flight controls must move  freely, and the hel­ icopter should respond normally. Then,  visually clear the surrounding area.  

Start the helicopter moving by smoothly and slowly eas­ ing the  cyclic forward (position 2). As the helicopter starts to move  forward, increase the collective, as nec­ essary, to prevent the  helicopter from sinking and adjust the throttle to maintain  rpm. The increase in power requires an increase in the proper  antitorque pedal to maintain heading. Maintain a straight  takeoff path throughout the takeoff.  

While accelerating through effec­ tive translational lift (position  3), the helicopter begins to climb, and the nose tends to rise  due to increased lift. At this point, adjust the collective to  obtain normal climb power and apply enough forward cyclic  to overcome the tendency of the nose to rise. At position 4,  hold an attitude that allows a smooth acceleration toward  climb­ ing airspeed and a commensurate gain in altitude so that  the takeoff profile does not take the helicopter through any  of the cross-hatched or shaded areas of the height/velocity  diagram. As airspeed increases (position 5), place the aircraft  in trim and allow a crab to take place to maintain ground track  and a more favorable climb configuration. As the helicopter  continues to climb and accel­ erate to best rate-of-climb, apply  aft cyclic pressure to raise the nose smoothly to the normal  climb attitude.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to use sufficient collective pitch to pre­ vent  loss of altitude prior to attaining transla­ tional lift. 2.	 Adding power too rapidly at the beginning of the  transition from hovering to forward flight without  forward cyclic compensation, causing the helicopter  to gain excessive altitude before acquiring airspeed. 3.	 Assuming an extreme nose-down attitude near the  surface in the transition from hovering to forward  flight. 4.	 Failing to maintain a straight flightpath over the  surface (ground track). 5.	 Failing to maintain proper airspeed during the climb. 6.	 Failing to adjust the throttle to maintain proper rpm. 7.	 Failing to transition to a level crab to maintain ground  track.  

![](images/62498d200c3303ed307b9282cee031ff93d99061c3e453eb263d226d92e624de.jpg)  
Figure 9-12.  The helicopter takes several positions during a normal takeoff from hover.  

# Normal Takeoff from the Surface  

Normal takeoff from the surface is used to move the helicopter  from a position on the surface into effective translational lift  and a normal climb using a minimum amount of power. If the  surface is dusty or covered with loose snow, this technique  provides the most favorable visibility conditions and reduces  the possibility of debris being ingested by the engine.  

# Technique  

Place the helicopter in a stationary position on the sur­ face.  Lower the collective to the full down position, and reduce  the rpm below operating rpm. Visually clear the area and  select terrain features or other objects to aid in maintaining  the desired track during takeoff and climb out. Increase the  throttle to the proper rpm, and raise the collective slowly  until the helicopter is light on the skids. Hesitate momentarily  and adjust the cyclic and antitorque pedals, as neces­ sary, to  prevent any surface movement. Continue to apply upward  collective. As the helicopter leaves the ground, use the  cyclic, as necessary, to begin forward movement as altitude  is gained. Continue to acceler­ ate. As effective translational  lift is attained, the helicopter begins to climb. Adjust attitude  and power, if necessary, to climb in the same manner as a  takeoff from a hover. A second, less efficient, but acceptable,  technique, is to attempt a vertical takeoff to evaluate if power  or lift is sufficient to clear obstructions. This allows the  helicopter to be returned to the takeoff position if required.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Departing the surface in an attitude that is too nose- low. This situation requires the use of exces­ sive power  to initiate a climb. 2.	 Using excessive power combined with a level attitude,  which causes a vertical climb, unless needed for  obstructions and landing considerations. 3. 	 Application of the collective that is too abrupt when  departing the surface, causing rpm and heading control  errors.  

# Crosswind Considerations During Takeoffs  

If the takeoff is made during crosswind conditions, the  helicopter is flown in a slip during the early stages of the  maneuver.  [Figure 9-13]  The cyclic is held into the wind a  sufficient amount to maintain the desired ground track for  the takeoff. The heading is maintained with the use of the  antitorque pedals. In other words, the rotor is tilted into the  wind so that the sideward movement of the helicopter is  just enough to counter­ act the crosswind effect. To prevent  the nose from turning in the direction of the rotor tilt, it is  necessary to increase the antitorque pedal pressure on the  After approximately 50 feet of altitude is gained, make a  coordinated turn into the wind to maintain the desired ground  track. This is called crabbing into the wind. The stronger the  crosswind, the more the helicopter has to be turned into the  wind to maintain the desired ground track.  [Figure 9-14]  

# Ground Reference Maneuvers  

Ground reference maneuvers may be used as training  exercises to help develop a division of attention between  the flightpath and ground references, and while controlling

the helicopter and watching for other air­ craft in the vicinity.  Other examples of ground reference maneuvers are flights  for photographic or observation purposes, such as pipe line  or power line checks. Prior to each maneuver, a clearing turn  should be done to ensure the area is free of conflicting traffic.  

# Rectangular Course  

The rectangular course is a training maneuver in which the  ground track of the helicopter is kept equidistant from the  sides of a selected rectangular area. While performing the  maneuver, the altitude and air­ speed should be held constant.  The rectangular course helps develop recognition of a drift  toward or away from a line parallel to the intended ground  track. This is helpful in recognizing drift toward or from an  airport runway during the various legs of the airport traffic  pattern and is also useful in observation and photographic  flights.  

# Technique  

Maintaining ground track while trying to fly a straight line  can be very difficult for new pilots to do. It is important to  understand the effects of the wind and how to compensate  for this. For this maneuver, pick a square or rectangular  field, or an area bounded on four sides by section lines or  roads, with sides approximately a mile in length. The area  selected should be well away from other air traffic. Fly the  maneuver approximately 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground  as appropriate. If the student finds it difficult to maintain a  proper ground track at that higher altitude, lower the altitude  for better ground reference until they feel more comfortable  and are able to grasp the concept better. Altitude can be raised  up to 1,000 feet as proficiency improves.  

Fly the helicopter parallel to and at a uniform distance, about  one-fourth to one-half mile, from the field boundaries, and  not directly above the boundaries. For best results, position  flightpath outside the field boundaries just far enough away  that they may be easily observed from either pilot seat by  looking out the side of the helicopter. If an attempt is made  to fly directly above the edges of the field, there will be no  usable reference points to start and complete the turns. In  addition, the closer the track of the helicop­ ter is to the field  boundaries, the steeper the bank necessary at the turning  points. The edges of the selected field should be seen while  seated in a normal position and looking out the side of the  helicopter during either a left-hand or right-hand course. The  distance of the ground track from the edges of the field should  be the same regardless of whether the course is flown to the  left or right. All turns should be started when the helicopter is  abeam the corners of the field boundaries. The bank nor­ mally  should not exceed  $30^{\circ}–45^{\circ}$   in light winds. Strong winds may  require more bank.  

line and maintain a specific heading, aircraft heading must be  adjusted in order to compensate for the winds and stay on the  proper ground track. Also, keep in mind that a constant scan  of flight instruments and outside references aid in maintaining  proper ground track.  

Although the rectangular course may be entered from any  direction, this discussion assumes entry on a downwind  heading.  [Figure 9-15]  while approaching the field boundary  on the downwind leg, begin planning for an upcoming turn.  Since there is a tailwind on the downwind leg, the helicopter’s  groundspeed is increased (position 1). During the turn, the  wind causes the heli­ copter to drift away from the field. To  counteract this effect, the roll-in should be made at a fairly  fast rate with a relatively steep bank (position 2). This is  normally the steepest turn of the maneuver.  

As the turn progresses, the tailwind component decreases,  which decreases the groundspeed. Consequently, the bank  angle and rate-of-turn must be reduced gradually to ensure  that upon completion of the turn, the crosswind ground track  continues to be the same distance from the edge of the field.  Upon completion of the turn, the helicopter should be level  and crabbed into the wind in order to maintain the proper  ground track. Keep in mind that in order to maintain proper  ground track the helicopter may have to be flown almost  sideways depending on the amount of wind. The forward  cyclic that is applied for airspeed will be in the direction of  the intended flight path. For this example, it will be in the  direction of the downwind corner of the field. However, since  the wind is now pushing the helicopter away from the field,  establish the proper drift correction by heading slightly into  the wind. Therefore, the turn should be greater than a   $90°$  change in heading (position 3). If the turn has been made  properly, the field boundary again appears to be one-fourth  to one-half mile away. While on the crosswind leg, the wind  correction should be adjusted, as necessary, to maintain a  uniform distance from the field boundary (position 4).  

As the next field boundary is being approached (position 5),  plan for the next turn. Since a wind correction angle is being  held into the wind and toward the field, this next turn requires  a turn of less than  $90°$  . Since there is now a headwind, the  groundspeed decreases during the turn, the bank initially must  be medium and progressively decrease as the turn pro­ ceeds.  To complete the turn, time the rollout so that the helicopter  becomes level at a point aligned with the corner of the field  just as the longitudinal axis of the helicopter again becomes  parallel to the field boundary (position 6). The distance from  the field boundary should be the same as on the other sides  of the field.

Figure 9-15.  Example of a rectangular course.  

Continue to evaluate each turn and determine the steepness  or shallowness based on the winds. It is also important to  remember that as the bank angles are adjusted in the turn,  the pilot is subsequently forced to make changes with the  flight controls.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Faulty entry technique. 2.	 Poor planning, orientation, and/or division of attention. 3.	 Uncoordinated flight control application. 4.	 Improper correction for wind drift. 5.	 Failure to maintain selected altitude and airspeed.  6.	 Selection of a ground reference with no suitable  emergency landing area within gliding distance.  7.	 Not flying a course parallel to the intended area (e.g.,  traffic pattern or square field).  

# S-Turns  

Another training maneuver to use is the S-turn, which helps  correct for wind drift in turns. This maneuver requires turns  to the left and right.  

Technique  

![](images/5240e27ae6280b0e2f916b999c53b6af400a48226292659634ca9e0d09fb3b40.jpg)  
Figure 9-16.  S-turns across a road.  

The pilot can choose to use a road, a fence, or a railroad  for a reference line. Regardless of what is used, it should  be straight for a considerable distance and should extend as  nearly perpendicular to the wind as possible. The object of  S-turns is to fly a pattern of two half cir­ cles of equal size  on opposite sides of the reference line.  [Figure 9-16]  The  maneuver should be performed at a constant altitude between  500 and 800 feet above the terrain. As mentioned previously,  if the student pilot is having a difficult time maintaining the  proper altitude and airspeed, have him or her attempt the  S-turn at a lower altitude, providing better ground reference.  The discussion that follows is based on choosing a reference  line perpendicular to the wind and starting the maneuver with  the helicopter facing downwind.  

As the helicopter crosses the reference line, immedi­ ately establish a bank. This initial bank is the steepest  used throughout the maneuver since the helicopter is  headed directly downwind and the groundspeed is greatest  (position 1). Gradually reduce the bank, as necessary, to  describe a ground track of a half circle. Time the turn so  that, as the rollout is completed, the helicopter is crossing  the reference line perpendicular to it and head­ ing directly  upwind (position 2). Immediately enter a bank in the opposite  direction to begin the second half of the “S” (position 3).  Since the helicopter is now on an upwind heading, this bank  (and the one just completed before crossing the reference  line) is the shallowest in the maneuver. Gradually increase  the bank, as necessary, to describe a ground track that is a  half circle identical in size to the one previously completed on  the other side of the refer­ ence line (position 4). The steepest  bank in this turn should be attained just prior to rollout when  the helicopter is approaching the reference line nearest the  downwind heading. Time the turn so that as the rollout is  com­ plete, the helicopter is perpendicular to the reference  line and is again heading directly downwind (position 5).  

In summary, the angle of bank required at any given  point in the maneuver is dependent on the ground­ speed.  The faster the groundspeed is, the steeper the bank is; the  slower the groundspeed is, the shallower the bank is. To  express it another way, the more nearly the helicopter is to a  downwind heading, the steeper the bank; the more nearly it  is to an upwind heading, the shallower the bank. In addition  to varying the angle of bank to correct for drift in order to  maintain the proper radius of turn, the helicopter must also  be flown with a drift correction angle (crab) in relation to its  ground track; except, of course, when it is on direct upwind  or downwind headings or there is no wind.  

One would normally think of the fore and aft axis of the  heli­ copter as being tangent to the ground track pattern at  each point. However, this is not the case. During the turn on  the upwind side of the reference line (side from which the  wind is blowing), crab the nose of the heli­ copter toward the  outside of the circle. During the turn on the downwind side  of the reference line (side of the reference line opposite to the  direction from which the wind is blowing), crab the nose of  the helicopter toward the inside of the circle. In either case, it  is obvious that the helicopter is being crabbed into the wind  just as it is when trying to maintain a straight ground track.  The amount of crab depends on the wind velocity and how  close the helicopter is to a crosswind position. The stronger  the wind is, the greater the crab angle is at any given position  for a turn of a given radius. The more nearly the helicopter  is to a crosswind position, the greater the crab angle. The  maximum crab angle should be at the point of each half circle  farthest from the reference line.  

A standard radius for S-turns cannot be specified, since the  radius depends on the airspeed of the helicopter, the velocity  of the wind, and the initial bank chosen for entry. The only  standard is crossing the ground reference line straight and  level and having equal radius semi-circles on both sides.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Using antitorque pedal pressures to assist turns. 2.	 Slipping or skidding in the turn. 3.	 An unsymmetrical ground track during S-turns across  a road.  4.	 Improper correction for wind drift. 5.	 Failure to maintain selected altitude or airspeed.  6.	 Excessive bank angles.  

# Turns Around a Point  

This training maneuver requires flying constant radius  turns around a preselected point on the ground using a bank  angle of approximately   $30^{\circ}{-}45^{\circ}$  , while maintaining both  a constant altitude and the same distance from the point  throughout the maneuver.  [Figure 9-17]  The objective, as in  other ground reference maneuvers, is to develop the ability  to subconsciously control the helicopter while dividing  attention between flightpath, how the winds are affecting  the turn and ground references and watching for other air  traffic in the vicinity. This is also used in high reconnaissance,  observation, and photography flight.  

# Technique  

The factors and principles of drift correction that are involved  in S-turns are also applicable to this maneu­ ver. As in other  ground track maneuvers, a constant radius around a point  requires the pilot to change the angle of bank constantly  and make numerous control changes to compensate for  

![](images/993659f58cfa978344b5b41b5b3f9bc0ce3417a266c68da64c713701a7ec83a3.jpg)  
Figure 9-17.  Turns around a point.  

the wind. The closer the helicopter is to a direct downwind  heading at which the groundspeed is greatest, the steeper the  bank and the greater the rate of turn required to establish the  proper wind correc­ tion angle. The closer the helicopter is to  a direct upwind heading at which the groundspeed is least,  the shallower the bank and the lower the rate of turn required  to establish the proper wind correction angle. Therefore,  throughout the maneuver, the bank and rate of turn must  be varied gradually and in proportion to the groundspeed  corrections made for the wind.  

The point selected for turns should be prominent and easily  distinguishable, yet small enough to present a precise  reference. Isolated trees, crossroads, or other similar small  landmarks are usually suitable. The point should be in an area  away from communities, livestock, or groups of people on  the ground to prevent possible annoyance or hazard to others.  Additionally, the area should be clear and suitable for any  emergency landings should they be required.  

Just as S-turns require that the helicopter be turned into the  wind in addition to varying the bank, so do turns around a  point. During the downwind half of the circle, the helicopter’s  nose must be progressively turned toward the inside of the  circle; during the upwind half, the nose must be progressively  turned toward the outside. The downwind half of the turn  around the point may be compared to the downwind side of  the S-turn, while the upwind half of the turn around a point  may be compared to the upwind side of the S-turn.  

drift and varying of the bank angle and wind correction angle  as required, entry into the maneuver may be from any point.  When entering this maneuver at any point, the radius of the  turn must be carefully selected, taking into account the wind  velocity and groundspeed so that an excessive bank is not  required later to maintain the proper ground track.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Faulty entry technique.  2.	 Poor planning, orientation, or division of attention. 3.	 Uncoordinated flight control application. 4.	 Improper correction for wind drift. 5.	 Failure to maintain selected altitude or airspeed. 6. 	 Failure to maintain an equal distance around the point.  7.	 Excessive bank angles.  

# Traffic Patterns  

A traffic pattern promotes safety by establishing a common  track to help pilots determine their landing order and provide  common reference. A traffic pattern is also useful to control  the flow of traffic, par­ ticularly at airports without operating  control towers. It affords a measure of safety, separation,  protection, and administrative control over arriving,  departing, and circling aircraft. Due to specialized operating  character­ istics, airplanes and helicopters do not mix well  in the same traffic environment. At multiple-use airports,  regulation states that helicopters should always avoid the  flow of fixed-wing traf­ fic. To do this, be familiar with the  patterns typically flown by airplanes. In addition, learn how  to fly these patterns in case air traf­ fic control (ATC) requests  a fixed-wing traffic pattern be flown. Traffic patterns are  initially taught during the day. Traffic patterns at night may  need to be adjusted; for more information, refer to Chapter  12, Night Operations.  

![](images/153f2c88ae77dcb45a5321071d40cc22ff945a817842c6ffdc586617fdefd5d4.jpg)  
Figure 9-18.  A standard fixed-wing traffic pattern consists of left  turns, has five designated legs, and is flown at 1,000' AGL.  

Upon gaining experience in performing turns around a point  and developing a good understanding of the effects of wind  A normal airplane traffic pattern is rectangular, has five named  legs, and a designated altitude, usually 1,000 feet AGL. While  flying the traffic pattern, pilots should always keep in mind  noise abatement rules and flying friendly to avoid dwellings  and livestock. A pattern in which all turns are to the left is  called a standard pattern.  [Figure 9-18]  The takeoff leg (item  1) normally consists of the aircraft’s flightpath after takeoff.  This leg is also called the departure leg. Turn to the crosswind  leg (item 2) after passing the departure end of the runway when  at a safe altitude. Fly the downwind leg (item 3) parallel to the  runway at the designated traffic pattern altitude and distance  from the runway. Begin the base leg (item 4) at a point selected  according to other traffic and wind conditions. If the wind is  very strong, begin the turn sooner than normal. If the wind  is light, delay the turn to base. The final approach (item 5)  is the path the air­ craft flies immediately prior to touchdown.  

Flying a fixed wing traffic pattern at 1,000 feet AGL upon  the request of ATC should not be a problem for a helicopter  unless conducting specific maneuvers that require specific  altitudes. There are variations at different localities and at  airports with operating control towers. For example, ATC  may have airplanes in a left turn pattern (as airplane pilots  are usually seated in the left), seat and a right turn pattern for  helicopters (as those pilots are usually in the right seat). This  arrangement affords the best view from each of the respective  cockpits. Always consult the Airport/Facility Directory for  the traffic pattern procedures at your airport/heliport.  

When approaching an airport with an operating control tower  in a helicopter, it is possible to expedite traffic by stating  intentions. The communication consists of:  

1.	 The helicopter’s call sign, “Helicopter 8340J.” 2.	 The helicopter’s position, “10 miles west.” 3.	 The “request for landing and hover to ...”  

To avoid the flow of fixed-wing traffic, the tower often  clears direct to an approach point or to a particular runway  intersection nearest the destination point. At uncontrolled  airports, if at all possible, adhere to standard practices and  patterns.  

Traffic pattern entry procedures at an airport with an operating  control tower are specified by the controller. At uncontrolled  airports, traffic pattern altitudes and entry procedures may  vary according to established local procedures. Helicopter  pilots should be aware of the standard airplane traffic  pattern and avoid it. Generally, helicopters make a lower  altitude pattern opposite from the fixed wing pattern and  make their approaches to some point other than the runway  in use by the fixed wing traffic. Chapter 7 of the Airplane  flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3 discusses this in greater  detail. For information concerning traffic pattern and landing  direction, utilize airport advisory service or UNICOM, when  available.  

The standard departure procedure when using the fixed- wing traffic pattern is usually a straight-out, down­ wind, or  right-hand departure. When a control tower is in operation,  request the type of departure desired. In most cases, helicopter  departures are made into the wind unless obstacles or traffic  dictate otherwise. At airports without an operating control  tower, comply with the departure procedures established for  that airport, if any.  

A helicopter traffic pattern is flown at 500-1,000 feet AGL  depending on considerations such as terrain, obstacles, and  other aircraft traffic.  [Figure 9-19]  This keeps the helicopter  out of the flow of fixed-wing traffic. A helicopter may take  off from a helipad into the wind with a turn to the right after  300 feet AGL or as needed to be in range of forced landing  areas. When 500 feet AGL is attained, a right turn to parallel  the takeoff path is made for the downwind. Then, as the  intended landing point is about 45 degrees behind the abeam  position of the helicopter, a right turn is made, and a descent  is begun from downwind altitude to approximately 300 feet  AGL for a base leg.  

As the helicopter nears the final approach path, the turn to  final should be made considering winds and obstructions.  Depending on obstructions and forced landing areas, the final  approach may need to be accomplished from as high as 500  feet AGL. The landing area should always be in sight and  the angle of approach should never be too high (indicating  that the base leg is too close) to the landing area or too low  (indicating that the landing area is too far away).  

# Approaches  

An approach is the transition from traffic pattern alti­ tude  to either a hover or to the surface. The approach should  

![](images/146794770f0b628692c5db4414f6529dd435d75bddb9f57c429db999140f9062.jpg)

terminate at the hover altitude with the rate of descent and  groundspeed reaching zero at the same time. Approaches  are categorized according to the angle of descent as normal,  steep, or shallow. In this chapter, concentration is on the  normal approach. Steep and shallow approaches are discussed  in the next chapter.  

Use the type of approach best suited to the existing conditions.  These conditions may include obstacles, size and surface of  the landing area, density altitude, wind direction and speed,  and weight. Regardless of the type of approach, it should  always be made to a specific, predetermined landing spot.  

# Normal Approach to a Hover  

A normal approach uses a descent angle of between  $7^{\circ}$   and   $12^{\circ}$  .  

# Technique  

On final approach, at the recommended approach airspeed  and at approximately 300 feet AGL, the helicopter should  be on the correct ground track (or ground alignment) for the  intended landing site, but the axis of the helicopter does not

Figure 9-20.  Plan the turn to final so the helicopter rolls out on an  imaginary extension of the centerline for the final approach path.  This path should neither angle to the landing area, as shown by  the helicopter on the left, nor require an S-turn, as shown by the  helicopter on the right.  

have to be aligned until about 50-100 feet AGL to facilitate  a controlled approach.  [Figure 9-20]  Just prior to reaching  the desired approach angle, begin the approach by lowering  the collective sufficiently to get the helicopter decelerating  and descending down the approach angle. With the decrease  in the collective, the nose tends to pitch down, requiring  aft cyclic to maintain the recommended approach airspeed  attitude. Adjust antitorque pedals, as necessary, to maintain  trim. Pilots should visualize the angle from the landing  point to the middle of the skids or landing gear underneath  them in the cockpit and maneuver the helicopter down that  imaginary slope until the helicopter is at a hover centered  over the landing point or touching down centered on the  landing point. The most important standard for a normal  approach is maintaining a consistent angle of approach to  the termination point. The collective controls the angle of  approach. Use the cyclic to control the rate of closure or how  fast the helicopter is moving towards the touchdown point.  Maintain entry airspeed until the apparent groundspeed and  rate of closure appear to be increasing. At this point, slowly  begin decelerating with slight aft cyclic, and smoothly lower  the collective to maintain approach angle. Use the cyclic to  maintain a rate of closure equivalent to a brisk walk.  

At approximately 25 knots, depending on wind, the helicopter  begins to lose effective translational lift. To compensate for  loss of effective translational lift, increase the collective to  maintain the approach angle, while maintaining the proper  rpm. The increase of collective pitch tends to make the nose  rise, requiring forward cyclic to maintain the proper rate of  closure.  

As the helicopter approaches the recommended hover  altitude, increase the collective sufficiently to maintain the  hover. Helicopters require near maximum power to land  because the inertia of the helicopter in a descent must be  overcome by lift in the rotor system. At the same time, apply  aft cyclic to stop any forward movement while controlling  the heading with antitorque pedals.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to maintain proper rpm during the entire  approach. 2.	 Improper use of the collective in controlling the angle  of descent. 3.	 Failing to make antitorque pedal corrections to  compensate for collective changes during the  approach. 4.	 Maintaining a constant airspeed on final approach  

instead of an apparent brisk walk.  

5.	 Failing to simultaneously arrive at hovering height  and attitude with zero groundspeed. 6.	 Low rpm in transition to the hover at the end of the  approach. 7.	 Using too much aft cyclic close to the surface, which  may result in tail rotor strikes. 8.   Failure to crab above 100’AGL and slip below  100’AGL.  

# Normal Approach to the Surface  

A normal approach to the surface or a no-hover landing is  often used if loose snow or dusty surface conditions exist.  These situations could cause severely restricted visibility, or  the engine could possibly ingest debris when the heli­ copter  comes to a hover. The approach is the same as the normal  approach to a hover; however, instead of termi­ nating at a  hover, continue the approach to touchdown. Touchdown  should occur with the skids level, zero groundspeed, and a  rate of descent approaching zero.  

# Technique  

As the helicopter nears the surface, increase the collec­ tive, as  necessary, to cushion the landing on the sur­ face, terminate in  a skids-level attitude with no forward movement.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Terminating to a hover, and then making a vertical  landing. 2.	 Touching down with forward movement. 3.	 Approaching too slow, requiring the use of exces­ sive  power during the termination. 4.	 Approaching too fast, causing a hard landing 5.	 Not maintaining skids aligned with direction of travel  at touchdown. Any movement or misalignment of the  skids or gear can induce dynamic rollover  

helicopter in hovering maneuvers is always controlled by  the pedals. The collective controls power, which is altitude  at a hover. This technique should be used on any type of  crosswind approach, whether it is a shallow, normal, or  steep approach.  

# Go-Around  

A go-around is a procedure for remaining airborne after  an intended landing is discontinued. A go-around may be  necessary when:  

•	 Instructed by the control tower. •	 Traffic conflict occurs. •	 The helicopter is in a position from which it is not  safe to continue the approach. Any time an approach  is uncomfortable, incorrect, or potentially dangerous,  abandon the approach. The deci­ sion to make a go- around should be positive and initiated before a critical  situation develops. When the decision is made, carry it  out without hesitation. In most cases, when initiating  the go-around, power is at a low setting. Therefore,  the first response is to increase collective to takeoff  power. This movement is coordinated with the throttle  to maintain rpm, and with the proper antitorque pedal  to control heading. Then, establish a climb attitude  and maintain climb speed to go around for another  approach.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter introduced basic flight maneuvers and the  techniques to perform each of them. Common errors and why  they happen were also described to help the pilot achieve a  better understanding of the maneuver.  

# Crosswind During Approaches  

During a crosswind approach, crab into the wind. At  approximately 50-100 feet of altitude, use a slip to align the  fuselage with the ground track. The rotor is tilted into the  wind with cyclic pressure so that the sideward movement  of the helicopter and wind drift counteracts each other.  Maintain the heading and ground track with the antitorque  pedals. Under crosswind approaches, ground track is always  controlled by the cyclic movement. The heading of the

# Advanced Flight Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

The maneuvers presented in this chapter require more skill  and understanding of the helicopter and the surrounding  environment. When performing these maneuvers, a pilot  is probably taking the helicopter to the edge of the safe  operating envelope. Therefore, if you are ever in doubt about  the outcome of the maneuver, abort the mission entirely or  wait for more favorable conditions.  

# Reconnaissance Procedures  

When planning to land or takeoff at an unfa­ miliar site,  gather as much information as possible about the area.  Reconnaissance techniques are ways of gathering this  information.  

# High Reconnaissance  

The purpose of conducting a high reconnaissance is to  determine direction and speed of the wind, a touchdown  point, suitability of the landing area, approach and departure  axes, and obstacles for both the approach and departure.  The pilot should also give particular consideration to forced  landing areas in case of an emergency.  

Altitude, airspeed, and flight pattern for a high recon­ naissance  are governed by wind and terrain features. It is important to  strike a balance between a reconnaissance conducted too high  and one too low. It should not be flown so low that a pilot  must divide attention between studying the area and avoiding  obstructions to flight. A high reconnaissance should be flown  at an alti­ tude of 300 to 500 feet above the surface. A general  rule to follow is to ensure that sufficient altitude is available  at all times to land into the wind in case of engine fail­ ure. In  addition, a  $45^{\circ}$   angle of observation generally allows the best  estimate of the height of barriers, the presence of obstacles,  the size of the area, and the slope of the terrain. Always  maintain safe altitudes and air­ speeds and keep a forced  landing area within reach whenever possible.  

# Low Reconnaissance  

A low reconnaissance is accomplished during the approach to  the landing area. When flying the approach, verify what was  observed in the high recon­ naissance, and check for anything  new that may have been missed at a higher altitude, such as  wires and their supporting structures (poles, towers, etc.),  slopes, and small crevices. If the pilot determines that the  area chosen is safe to land in, the approach can be continued.  However, the decision to land or go around must be made  prior to decelerating below effective translational lift (ETL),  or before descending below the barriers surrounding the  confined area.  

If a decision is made to complete the approach, termi­ nate  the landing to a hover in order to check the landing point  carefully before lowering the helicopter to the surface.  Under certain conditions, it may be desirable to continue  the approach to the surface. Once the heli­ copter is on the  ground, maintain operating revolutions per minute (rpm)  until the stability of the helicopter has been checked to be  sure it is in a secure and safe position.  

# Ground Reconnaissance  

Prior to departing an unfamiliar location, make a detailed  analysis of the area. There are several factors to consider  during this evaluation. Besides determining the best departure  path and identifying all hazards in the area, select a route that  gets the helicopter from its present position to the take­ off  point while avoiding all hazards, especially to the tail rotor  and landing gear.  

Some things to consider while formulating a takeoff plan  are the aircraft load, height of obstacles, the shape of the  area, direction of the wind, and surface conditions. Surface  conditions can consist of dust, sand and snow, as well as  mud and rocks. Dust landings and snow landings can lead  to a brownout or whiteout condition, which is the loss of  the horizon reference. Disorientation may occur, leading to  ground contact, often with fatal results. Taking off or landing  on uneven terrain, mud, or rocks can cause the tail rotor to  strike the surface or if the skids get caught can lead to dynamic  rollover. If the helicopter is heavily loaded, determine if there  is sufficient power to clear the obstacles. Sometimes it is better  to pick a path over shorter obstacles than to take off directly  into the wind. Also evaluate the shape of the area so that a path  can be chosen that will provide you the most room to maneuver  and abort the take­ off if necessary. Positioning the helicopter  at the most downwind portion of the confined area gives the  pilot the most distance to clear obstacles.  

Wind analysis also helps determine the route of takeoff.  The prevailing wind can be altered by obstructions on  the departure path and can significantly affect aircraft  performance. There are several ways to check the wind  direction before taking off. One technique is to watch the tops  of the trees; another is to look for any smoke in the area. If  there is a body of water in the area, look to see which way the  water is rippling. If wind direction is still in question revert  to the last report that was received by either the Automatic  Terminal Information Service (ATIS) or airport tower.  

# Maximum Performance Takeoff  

A maximum performance takeoff is used to climb at a steep  angle to clear barriers in the flightpath. It can be used when  taking off from small areas surrounded by high obstacles.  Allow for a vertical takeoff, although not preferred, if  obstruction clearance could be in doubt. Before attempting  a maximum performance takeoff, know thoroughly the  capabilities and limitations of the equipment. Also consider  the wind velocity, temperature, density alti­ tude, gross weight,  center of gravity (CG) location, and other factors affecting  pilot technique and the perform­ ance of the helicopter.  

To accomplish this type of takeoff safely, there must be  enough power to hover out of ground effect (OGE) in order  to prevent the helicopter from sinking back to the surface  after becoming airborne. A hover power check can be used to  deter­ mine if there is sufficient power available to accomplish  this maneuver.  

The angle of climb for a maximum performance takeoff  depends on existing conditions. The more critical the  conditions are, such as high-density altitudes, calm winds,  and high gross weights, the shallower the angle of climb is. In  light or no wind conditions, it might be necessary to operate  in the crosshatched or shaded areas of the height/velocity  diagram during the begin­ ning of this maneuver. Therefore,  be aware of the calculated risk when operating in these areas.  An engine failure at a low altitude and airspeed could place  the helicopter in a dangerous position, requiring a high degree  of skill in making a safe autorotative landing.  

# Technique  

Before attempting a maximum performance takeoff,  reposition the helicopter to the most downwind area to allow a  longer takeoff climb, then bring the helicopter to a hover, and  determine the excess power available by noting the difference  between the power available and that required to hover.  Also, perform a balance and flight control check and note  the position of the cyclic. If the takeoff path allows, position  the helicopter into the wind and return the helicopter to the  surface. Normally, this maneuver is initiated from the surface.  After checking the area for obstacles and other aircraft, select  reference points along the takeoff path to maintain ground  track. Also consider alternate routes in case the maneuver is  not possible.  [Figure 10-1]  

Begin the takeoff by getting the helicopter light on the skids  (position 1). Pause and neutralize all aircraft movement.  Slowly increase the collective and position the cyclic  

![](images/4481931fa717c83bfb34ab19b9d1b9a3a299cade43c7f9e5f6a52c8bdd223c33.jpg)

to lift off in a 40-knot attitude. This is approximately  the same attitude as when the helicopter is light on the  skids. Continue to increase the collec­ tive slowly until the  maximum power available is reached (takeoff power is  normally 10 percent above power required for hover). This  large collective movement requires a substantial increase  in pedal pressure to maintain heading (position 2). Use the  cyclic, as necessary, to control movement toward the desired  flightpath and, therefore, climb angle during the maneuver  (position 3). Maintain rotor rpm at its maxi­ mum, and do  not allow it to decrease since you would probably need to  lower the collective to regain it. Maintain these inputs until  the helicopter clears the obstacle, or until reaching 50 feet  for demonstration purposes (position 4). Then, establish a  normal climb attitude and power setting (position 5). As  in any maximum performance maneuver, the techniques  used affect the actual results. Smooth, coordinated inputs  coupled with precise control allow the helicopter to attain  its maximum performance.  

An acceptable method when departing from an area that does  not allow for a takeoff with forward airspeed is to perform a  vertical takeoff. This technique allows the pilot to descend  vertically back into the confined area if the helicopter  does not have the performance to clear the surrounding  obstacles. During this maneuver, the helicopter must climb  vertically and not be allowed to accelerate forward until the  surrounding obstacles have been cleared. If not, a situation  may develop where the helicopter does not have sufficient  climb performance to avoid obstructions and may not have  power to descend back to the takeoff point. The vertical  takeoff might not be as efficient as the climbing profile but  is much easier to abort from a vertical position directly over  the landing point. The vertical takeoff, however, places the  helicopter in the  avoid  area of the height/velocity diagram  for a longer time. This maneuver requires hover OGE power  to accomplish.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to consider performance data, including height- velocity diagram. 2.	 Nose too low initially causing horizontal flight rather  than more vertical flight. 3.	 Failure to maintain maximum permissible rpm. 4.	 Abrupt control movements. 5.	 Failure to resume normal climb power and air­ speed  after clearing the obstacle.  

# Running/Rolling Takeoff  

A running takeoff in helicopter with fixed landing gear,  such as skids, skis or floats, or a rolling takeoff in a  wheeled helicopter is sometimes used when conditions of  load and/or density altitude prevent a sus­ tained hover at  normal hovering height. For wheeled helicopters, a rolling  takeoff is sometimes used to minimize the downwash  created during a takeoff from a hover. Avoid a running/ rolling maneuver if there is not sufficient power to hover,  at least momentarily. If the helicopter cannot be hovered,  its performance is unpredictable. If the helicopter cannot  be raised off the surface at all, sufficient power might not  be available to accomplish the maneuver safely. If a pilot  cannot momentarily hover the helicopter, wait for conditions  to improve or off-load some of the weight.  

To accomplish a safe running or rolling takeoff, the sur­ face  area must be of sufficient length and smoothness, and there  cannot be any barriers in the flightpath to interfere with a  shallow climb.  

# Technique  

Refer to  Figure 10-2 . To begin the maneuver, first align the  helicopter to the takeoff path. Next, increase the throttle to  obtain takeoff rpm, and increase the collec­ tive smoothly  until the helicopter becomes light on the skids or landing  gear (position 1). If taking off from the water, ensure that  the floats are mostly out of the water. Then, move the cyclic  slightly forward of the neutral hovering position, and apply  additional collective to start the forward movement (position  2). To simulate a reduced power condition during practice,  use one to two inches less manifold pressure, or three to five  percent less torque than that required to hover. The landing  gear must stay aligned with the takeoff direction until the  helicopter leaves the surface to avoid dynamic rollover.  

Maintain a straight ground track with lateral cyclic and  heading with antitorque pedals until a climb is established.  As effective translational lift is gained, the helicopter  becomes airborne in a fairly level attitude with little or no  pitching (position 3). Maintain an altitude to take advan­ tage  of ground effect, and allow the airspeed to increase toward  normal climb speed. Then, follow a climb profile that takes  the helicopter through the clear area of the height-velocity  

![](images/fb523022a2ea5b671a1f85bd943ad7efa21892488eeb222508a083cba9d20e12.jpg)

diagram (position 4). During practice maneuvers, after having  climbed to an altitude of 50 feet, establish the normal climb  power setting and attitude.  

NOTE: It should be remembered that if a running takeoff is  necessary for most modern helicopters, the helicopter is very  close to, or has exceeded the maximum operating weight for  the conditions (i.e., temperature and altitude).  

The height/velocity parameters should be respected at all  times. The helicopter should be flown to a suitable altitude  to allow a safe acceleration in accordance with the height- velocity diagram.  

# Common Errors  

1. 	 Failing to align heading and ground track to keep  surface friction to a minimum. 2.	 Attempting to become airborne before obtaining  effective translational lift. 3.	 Using too much forward cyclic during the surface run. 4.	 Lowering the nose too much after becoming air­ borne,  resulting in the helicopter settling back to the surface. 5.	 Failing to remain below the recommended altitude  until airspeed approaches normal climb speed.  

# Rapid Deceleration or Quick Stop  

This maneuver is used to decelerate from forward flight to a  hover. It is often used to abort takeoffs, to stop if something  blocks the helicopter flightpath, or simply to terminate an air  taxi maneuver, as mentioned in the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM). A quick stop is usually practiced on a runway,  taxiway, or over a large grassy area away from other traffic  or obstacles.  

# Technique  

The maneuver requires a high degree of coordination of  all controls. It is practiced at a height that permits a safe  clearance between the tail rotor and the surface throughout  the maneuver, especially at the point where the pitch attitude  is highest. The height at completion should be no higher  than the maximum safe hovering height prescribed by that  particular helicopter’s manufacturer. In selecting a height at  which to begin the maneuver, take into account the overall  length of the helicopter and its height/velocity diagram. Even  though the maneuver is called a rapid deceleration or quick  stop, it is performed slowly and smoothly with the primary  emphasis on coordination.  

During training, always perform this maneuver into the wind  [Figure 10-3, position 1] . After leveling off at an altitude  

![](images/8a1b7c0b2dd3dafc25f924d8ffd839af78486942c759d99d0b1ff555f0cc2afa.jpg)  
Figure 10-3.  Rapid deceleration or quick stop.  

between 25 and 40 feet, depending upon the manufacturer’s  recommendations, accelerate to the desired entry speed,  which is approximately 45 knots for most training helicopters  (position 2). The altitude chosen should be high enough to  avoid danger to the tail rotor during the flare, but low enough  to stay out of the hazardous areas of that helicopter’s height- velocity diagram throughout the maneuver. In addition, this  altitude should be low enough that the helicopter can be  brought to a hover during the recovery.  

At position 3, initiate the deceleration by applying aft cyclic  to reduce forward groundspeed. Simultaneously, lower the  collective, as necessary, to counteract any climbing tendency.  The timing must be exact. If too little collective is taken out  for the amount of aft cyclic applied, the helicopter climbs. If  too much downward collective is applied, the helicopter will  descend. A rapid application of aft cyclic requires an equally  rapid application of down collective. As collective is lowered,  apply proper antitorque pedal pressure to maintain heading,  and adjust the throttle to maintain rpm. The G loading on the  rotor system depends on the pitch-up attitude. If the attitude is  too high, the rotor system may stall and cause the helicopter  to impact the surface.  

After attaining the desired speed (position 4), initiate the  recovery by lowering the nose and allowing the helicopter  to descend to a normal hovering height in level flight and  zero groundspeed (position 5). During the recovery, increase  collective pitch, as necessary, to stop the helicopter at normal  hovering height, adjust the throttle to maintain rpm, and apply  proper antitorque pedal pressure, as necessary, to maintain  heading. During the maneuver, visualize rotating about the  tail rotor’s horizontal axis until a normal hovering height is  reached.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Initiating the maneuver by lowering the collective  without aft cyclic pressure to maintain altitude.  2.	 Initially applying aft cyclic stick too rapidly, causing  the helicopter to balloon (climb).  3.	 Failing to effectively control the rate of deceleration  to accomplish the desired results.  4.	 Allowing the helicopter to stop forward motion in a  tail-low attitude.  5.	 Failing to maintain proper rotor rpm.  6.	 Waiting too long to apply collective pitch (power)  during the recovery, resulting in an overtorque  situation when collective pitch is applied rapidly.  7.	 Failing to maintain a safe clearance over the terrain.  8.	 Using antitorque pedals improperly, resulting in erratic  heading changes. 9.	 Using an excessively nose-high attitude.  

# Steep Approach  

A steep approach is used primarily when there are obstacles  in the approach path that are too high to allow a normal  approach. A steep approach permits entry into most confined  areas and is sometimes used to avoid areas of turbulence  around a pinnacle. An approach angle of approximately  $13^{\circ}$  to   $15^{\circ}$   is considered a steep approach.  [Figure 10-4]  Caution  must be exercised to avoid the parameters for vortex ring  state (20–100 percent of available power applied, airspeed  of less than 10 knots, and a rate of descent greater than 300  feet per minute (fpm)). For additional information on vortex  ring state (formerly referenced as settling-with-power), refer  to Chapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards.  

![](images/e269d6d7ef5c3e1d02bb68ecfb3b6149231acab8daf7ed25eb447c6cf31f253b.jpg)  
Figure 10-4.  Steep approach to a hover.  

# Technique  

On final approach, maintain track with the intended  touchdown point and into the wind as much as possible at the  recommended approach airspeed  [Figure 10-4, position  $I J$  When intercepting an approach angle of   $13^{\circ}$   to   $15^{\circ}$  , begin  the approach by lowering the collective sufficiently to start  the helicopter descending down the approach path and  decelerating (position 2). Use the proper antitorque pedal for  trim. Since this angle is steeper than a normal approach angle,  reduce the collective more than that required for a normal  approach. Continue to decelerate with slight aft cyclic and  smoothly lower the collective to maintain the approach angle.  

The intended touchdown point may not always be visible  throughout the approach, especially when landing to a hover.  Pilots must learn to cue in to other references that are parallel  to the intended landing area that will help them maintain  ground track and position.  

Constant management of approach angle and airspeed is  essential to any approach. Aft cyclic is required to decelerate  sooner than with a normal approach, and the rate of closure  becomes apparent at a higher altitude. Maintain the approach  angle and rate of descent with the collective, rate of closure  with the cyclic, and trim with antitorque pedals.  

The helicopter should be kept in trim just prior to loss of  effective translational lift (approximately 25 knots). Below  100 feet above ground level (AGL), the antitorque pedals  should be adjusted to align the helicopter with the intended  touchdown point. Visualize the location of the tail rotor  behind the helicopter and fly the landing gear to 3 feet above  the intended landing point. In small confined areas, the pilot  must precisely position the helicopter over the intended  landing area. Therefore, the approach must stop at that point.  

Loss of effective translational lift occurs higher in a steep  approach (position 3), requiring an increase in the collective  to prevent settling, and more forward cyclic to achieve  the proper rate of closure. Once the intended landing area  is reached, terminate the approach to a hover with zero  groundspeed (position 4). If the approach has been executed  properly, the helicopter will come to a halt at a hover altitude  of 3 feet over the intended landing point with very little  additional power required to hold the hover.  

The pilot must remain aware that any wind effect is lost once  the aircraft has descended below the barriers surrounding a  confined area, causing the aircraft to settle more quickly.  Additional power may be needed on a strong wind condition  as the helicopter descends below the barriers.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to maintain proper rpm during the entire  approach. 2.	 Using collective improperly in maintaining the  selected angle of descent. 3.	 Failing to make antitorque pedal corrections to  compensate for collective pitch changes during the  approach. 4.	 Slowing airspeed excessively in order to remain on  the proper angle of descent. 5.	 Failing to determine when effective transla­ tional lift  is being lost. 6.	 Failing to arrive at hovering height and attitude, and  zero groundspeed almost simultaneously. 7.	 Utilizing low rpm in transition to the hover at the end  of the approach. 8.	 Using too much aft cyclic close to the surface, which  may result in the tail rotor striking the sur­ face. 9.	 Failure to align landing gear with direction of travel  no later than beginning of loss of translational lift.  

# Shallow Approach and Running/Roll-On  Landing  

Use a shallow approach and running landing when a  high-density altitude, a high gross weight condition, or  some combination thereof, is such that a normal or steep  approach cannot be made because of insufficient power  to hover.  [Figure   $I O–5J$    To compensate for this lack of  power, a shallow approach and running landing makes  use of translational lift until surface contact is made. If  flying a wheeled helicopter, a roll-on landing can be used  

![](images/c3da31d512cd995f5ade2639fdbad5b4190505d3e9cd0bde4c7e997ad3b3c851.jpg)  
Figure 10-5.  Shallow approach and running landing.  

to minimize the effect of downwash. The glide angle for a  shallow approach is approximately  $3^{\circ}$   to   $5^{\circ}$  . This angle is  similar to the angle used on an instrument landing system  (ILS) approach. Since the helicopter is sliding or rolling  to a stop during this maneuver, the landing area should  be smooth, and the landing gear must be aligned with the  direction of travel to prevent dynamic rollover and must be  long enough to accomplish this task. After landing, ensure  that the pitch of the rotor blades is not too far aft as the main  rotor blades could contact the tailboom.  

# Technique  

A shallow approach is initiated in the same manner as the  normal approach except that a shallower angle of descent is  maintained. The power reduction to initiate the desired angle  of descent is less than that for a normal approach since the  angle of descent is less (position 1).  

As the collective is lowered, maintain heading with proper  antitorque pedal pressure and rpm with the throttle. Maintain  approach airspeed until the apparent rate of closure appears  to be increasing. Then, begin to slow the helicopter with aft  cyclic (position 2).  

As in normal and steep approaches, the primary control  for the angle and rate of descent is the collective, while the  cyclic primarily controls the groundspeed. However, there  must be a coordination of all the con­ trols for the maneuver  to be accomplished successfully. The helicopter should  arrive at the point of touchdown at or slightly above effective  translational lift. Since translational lift diminishes rapidly  at slow airspeeds, the deceleration must be coordinated  smoothly, at the same time keeping enough lift to prevent  the helicopter from settling abruptly.  

Just prior to touchdown, place the helicopter in a level  attitude with the cyclic, and maintain heading with the  antitorque pedals. Use the cyclic to keep the direction of  travel and ground track identical (position 3). Allow the  helicopter to descend gently to the surface in a straight-­ and- level attitude, cushioning the landing with the collective.  After surface contact, move the cyclic slightly forward to  ensure clearance between the tail boom and the rotor disk.  

Use the cyclic to maintain the surface track (position 4).  A pilot normally holds the collective stationary until the  helicopter stops; however, to get more braking action, lower  the collective slightly.  

Keep in mind that, due to the increased ground friction when  the collective is lowered or if the landing is being executed  to a rough or irregular surface, the helicopter may come to  an abrupt stop and the nose might pitch forward. Exercise  caution not to correct this pitching movement with aft cyclic,  which could result in the rotor making contact with the tail  boom. An abrupt stop may also cause excessive transmission  movement resulting in the transmission contacting its mount.  During the landing, maintain normal rpm with the throttle  and directional control with the antitorque pedals.  

For wheeled helicopters, use the same technique except  after landing, lower the collective, neutralize the controls,  and apply the brakes, as necessary, to slow the helicopter.  Do not use aft cyclic when bringing the helicopter to a stop.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Assuming excessive nose-high attitude to slow the  helicopter near the surface. 2.	 Utilizing insufficient collective and throttle to cushion  a landing. 3.	 Failure to maintain heading resulting in a turning or  pivoting motion.  4.	 Failure to add proper antitorque pedal as collec­ tive is  added to cushion landing, resulting in a touchdown  while the helicopter is moving sideward. 5.	 Failure to maintain a speed that takes advantage of  effective translational lift. 6.	 Touching down at an excessive groundspeed for the  existing conditions. (Some helicopters have maximum  touchdown groundspeeds.) 7.	 Failure to touch down in the appropriate attitude  necessary for a safe landing. Appropriate attitude is  based on the type of helicopter and the landing gear  installed. 8.	 Failure to maintain proper rpm during and after  touchdown. 9.	 Maintaining poor alignment with direction of travel  during touchdown.  

# Slope Operations  

Prior to conducting any slope operations, be thoroughly  familiar with the characteristics of dynamic rollover and  mast bumping, which are discussed in Chapter 11, Helicopter  Emergencies and Hazards. The approach to a slope is similar  to the approach to any other landing area. During slope  operations, make allowances for wind, barriers, and forced  landing sites in case of engine failure. Since the slope may  constitute an obstruction to wind passage, anticipate turbulence  and downdrafts.  

# Slope Landing  

A pilot usually lands a helicopter across the slope rather than  with the slope. Landing with the helicopter facing down  the slope or downhill is not recommended because of the  possibility of striking the tail rotor on the surface.  

# Technique  

Refer to  Figure 10-6 . At the termination of the approach, if  necessary, move the helicopter slowly toward the slope, being  careful not to turn the tail upslope. Position the helicopter  across the slope at a stabilized hover headed into the wind  over the intended landing spot (frame 1). Downward pressure  on the collective starts the helicopter descending. As the  upslope skid touches the ground, hesitate momentarily in a  level attitude, then apply slight lateral cyclic in the direction  of the slope (frame 2). This holds the skid against the slope  while the pilot continues lowering the downslope skid with  the col­ lective. As the collective is lowered, continue to move  the cyclic toward the slope to maintain a fixed position (frame  3) The slope must be shallow enough to hold the helicopter  against it with the cyclic during the entire landing. A slope of   $5^{\circ}$   is recommended maximum for training in most helicopters.  However, additional training to the manufacturer’s  limitations may be required. Consult the Rotorcraft Flight  Manual (RFM) or Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH) for  the specific limitations of the helicopter being flown.  

Be aware of any abnormal vibration or mast bumping that  signals maximum cyclic deflection. If helicopter mast  moment or slope limits are reached before the helicopter  is firmly on the ground, return the helicopter to a hover.  Select a new area with a lesser degree of slope. In most  helicopters with a counterclockwise rotor system, landings  can be made on steeper slopes when holding the cyclic to the  right. When landing on slopes using left cyclic, some cyclic  input must be used to overcome the translating tendency.  If wind is not a factor, consider the drifting tendency when  determining landing direction.  

After the downslope skid is on the surface, reduce the  collective to full down, and neutralize the cyclic and pedals  (frame 4). Normal operating rpm should be maintained  until the full weight of the helicopter is on the landing gear.  

This ensures adequate rpm for immediate takeoff in case the  helicopter starts sliding down the slope. Use antitorque pedals  as necessary throughout the landing for heading control.  Before reducing the rpm, move the cyclic control as neces­ sary  to check that the helicopter is firmly on the ground.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to consider wind effects during the approach  and landing. 2.	 Failing to maintain proper rpm throughout the entire  maneuver. 3.	 Failure to maintain heading resulting in a turning or  pivoting motion. 4.	 Turning the tail of the helicopter into the  slope.	   5.	 Lowering the downslope skid or wheel too rapidly. 6.	 Applying excessive cyclic control into the slope,  causing mast bumping.  

# Slope Takeoff  

A slope takeoff is basically the reverse of a slope land­ ing.  [Figure 10-7]  Conditions that may be associated with the  slope, such as turbulence and obstacles, must be considered  during the takeoff. Planning should include suitable forced  landing areas.  

![](images/d0fbe92bc0b3a88b1711de43a71f326cb5cb5df9df9442007ac1c1c33c472739.jpg)

Figure 10-7.  Slope takeoff.  

# Technique  

Begin the takeoff by increasing rpm to the normal range with  the collective full down. Then, move the cyclic toward the  slope (frame 1). Holding the cyclic toward the direction of  the slope causes the downslope skid to rise as the pilot slowly  raises the collective (frame 2). As the skid comes up, move  the cyclic as necessary to maintain a level attitude in relation  to the horizon. If properly coordinated, the helicopter should  attain a level attitude as the cyclic reaches the neutral position.  At the same time, use antitorque pedal pressure to maintain  heading and throttle to maintain rpm. With the helicopter  level and the cyclic centered, pause momentarily to verify  everything is correct, and then gradually raise the collective  to complete the liftoff (frame 3). After reaching a hover,  avoid hitting the ground with the tail rotor by not turning the  helicopter tail upslope and gaining enough altitude to ensure  the tail rotor is clear. If an upslope wind exists, execute a  crosswind takeoff and then make a turn into the wind after  clearing the ground with the tail rotor.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failing to adjust cyclic control to keep the heli­ copter  from sliding down slope. 2.	 Failing to maintain proper rpm. 3.	 Holding excessive cyclic into the slope as the down  slope skid is raised. 4.	 Failure to maintain heading, resulting in a turning or  pivoting motion. 5.	 Turning the tail of the helicopter into the slope during  takeoff.  

# Confined Area Operations  

A confined area is an area where the flight of the heli­ copter  is limited in some direction by terrain or the presence of  obstructions, natural or manmade. For example, a clearing  in the woods, a city street, a road, a building roof, etc., can  each be regarded as a confined area. The helicopter pilot  has added responsibilities when conducting operations  from a confined area that airplanes pilots do not. He or she  assumes the additional roles of the surveyor, engineer, and  manager when selecting an area to conduct operations. While  airplane pilots generally operate from known pre-surveyed  and improved landing areas, helicopter pilots fly into areas  never used before for helicopter operations. Generally,  takeoffs and landings should be made into the wind to obtain  maximum airspeed with minimum groundspeed. The pilot  should begin with as nearly accurate an altimeter setting as  possible to determine the altitude.  

There are several things to consider when operating in  confined areas. One of the most important is maintaining  a clearance between the rotors and obstacles forming the  confined area. The tail rotor deserves special considera­ tion  because, in some helicopters, it is not always visible from  the cabin. This not only applies while making the approach,  but also while hovering. Another consider­ ation is that wires  are especially difficult to see; however, their supporting  devices, such as poles or towers, serve as an indication of  their presence and approximate height. If any wind is present,  expect some turbulence.  [Figure 10-8]  

Something else to consider is the availability of forced  landing areas during the planned approach. Think about  the possibility of flying from one alternate landing area to  another throughout the approach, while avoiding unfavorable  areas. Always leave a way out in case the landing cannot be  completed, or a go-around is necessary.  

During the high reconnaissance, the pilot needs to formulate  a takeoff plan as well. The heights of obstacles need to be  determined. It is not good practice to land in an area and  then determine that insufficient power exists to depart.  Generally, more power is required to take off than to land  so the takeoff criteria is most crucial. Fixing the departure  azimuth or heading on the compass is a good technique to  use. This ensures that the pilot is able to take off over the  preselected departure path when it is not visible while sitting  in the confined area.

Figure 10-8.  If the wind velocity is 10 knots or greater, expect updrafts on the windward side and downdrafts on the lee side of obstacles.  Plan the approach with these factors in mind, but be ready to alter plans if the wind speed or direction changes.  

# Approach  

A high reconnaissance should be completed before ini­ tiating  the confined area approach. Start the approach phase using  the wind and speed to the best possible advantage. Keep in  mind areas suitable for forced land­ ing. It may be necessary to  choose a crosswind approach that is over an open area, then  one directly into the wind that is over trees. If these conditions  exist, consider the possibility of making the initial phase of  the approach crosswind over the open area and then turn­ ing  into the wind for the final portion of the approach.  

Always operate the helicopter as close to its normal capabilities  as possible, taking into consideration the situation at hand. In  all confined area operations, with the exception of a pinnacle  operation (see next section, Takeoff), the angle of descent  should be no steeper than necessary to clear any barrier with  the tail rotor in the approach path and still land on the selected  spot. The angle of climb on takeoff should be normal, or not  steeper than necessary to clear any bar­ rier. Clearing a barrier by  a few feet and maintaining normal operating rpm, with perhaps  a reserve of power, is better than clearing a barrier by a wide  mar­ gin but with a dangerously low rpm and no power reserve.  

Always make the landing to a specific point and not to some  general area. This point should be located well forward,  away from the approach end of the area. The more confined  the area is, the more essential it is that the helicopter land  precisely at a definite point. Keep this point in sight during  the entire final approach.  

When flying a helicopter near obstacles, always consider  the tail rotor. A safe angle of descent over bar­ riers must be  established to ensure tail rotor clearance of all obstructions.  After coming to a hover, avoid turning the tail into obstructions.  

# Takeoff  

A confined area takeoff is considered an altitude over  airspeed maneuver where altitude gain is more important to  airspeed gain. Before takeoff, make a reconnaissance from  the ground or cockpit to determine the type of takeoff to  be performed, to determine the point from which the take­ off should be initiated to ensure the maximum amount of  available area, and finally, how to maneuver the helicopter  best from the landing point to the proposed take­ off position.  

If wind conditions and available area permit, the heli­ copter should be brought to a hover, turned around, and  hovered forward from the landing position to the take­ off  position. Under certain conditions, sideward flight to the  takeoff position may be preferred, but rearward flight may  be necessary, stopping often while moving to check on the  location of obstacles relative to the tail rotor.  

When planning the takeoff, consider the direction of the wind,  obstructions, and forced landing areas. To help fly up and  over an obstacle, form an imaginary line from a point on the  leading edge of the helicopter to the highest obstacle to be  cleared. Fly this line of ascent with enough power to clear  the obstacle by a safe distance. After clearing the obstacle,  maintain the power setting and accelerate to the normal climb  speed. Then, reduce power to the normal climb power setting.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to perform, or improper performance of, a high  or low reconnaissance. 2.	 Approach angle that is too steep or too shal­ low for the  existing conditions. 3.	 Failing to maintain proper rpm.  

4.	 Failure to consider emergency landing areas. 5.	 Failure to select a specific landing spot.  

6.	 Failure to consider how wind and turbulence could  affect the approach. 7.	 Improper takeoff and climb technique for exist­ ing  conditions. 8.	 Failure to maintain safe clearance distance from  obstructions.  

# Pinnacle and Ridgeline Operations  

A pinnacle is an area from which the surface drops away  steeply on all sides. A ridgeline is a long area from which  the surface drops away steeply on one or two sides, such  as a bluff or precipice. The absence of obstacles does not  necessarily decrease the difficulty of pinnacle or ridgeline  operations. Updrafts, downdrafts, and turbulence, together  with unsuitable terrain in which to make a forced landing,  may still present extreme hazards.  

# Approach and Landing  

If there is a need to climb to a pinnacle or ridgeline, do it on  the upwind side, when practicable, to take advantage of any  updrafts. The approach flightpath should be paral­ lel to the  ridgeline and into the wind as much as possi­ ble.  [Figure 10-9]  

Load, altitude, wind conditions, and terrain features  determine the angle to use in the final part of an approach.  As a general rule, the greater the winds are, the steeper the  approach needs to be to avoid turbulent air and downdrafts.  

![](images/d40fd4fb2c326acc2867d67eb341abd236f6dc4a3c09f1b33b13d5a7b0e31c78.jpg)  
Figure 10-9.  When flying an approach to a pinnacle or ridgeline,  avoid the areas where downdrafts are present, especially when  excess power is limited. If downdrafts are encountered, it may  become necessary to make an immediate turn away from the  pinnacle to avoid being forced into the rising terrain.  

Groundspeed during a pinnacle approach is more difficult to  judge because visual references are farther away than during  approaches over trees or flat terrain. Pilots must continually  perceive the apparent rate of closure by observing the apparent  change in size of the landing zone features. Avoid the  misperception of an increasing rate of closure to the landing  site. The apparent rate of closure should be that of a brisk  walk. If a crosswind exists, remain clear of down-drafts on  the leeward or downwind side of the ridgeline. If the wind  velocity makes the crosswind landing hazardous, it may be  possible to make a low, coordinated turn into the wind just  prior to terminating the approach. When making an approach  to a pinnacle, avoid leeward turbulence and keep the helicopter  within reach of a forced landing area as long as possible.  

On landing, take advantage of the long axis of the area when  wind conditions permit. Touchdown should be made in the  forward portion of the area. When approaching to land on  pinnacles, especially manmade areas such as rooftop pads,  the pilot should determine the personnel access pathway to  the helipad and ensure that the tail rotor is not allowed to  intrude into that walkway or zone. Parking or landing with the  tail rotor off the platform ensures personnel safety. Always  per­ form a stability check prior to reducing rpm to ensure  the landing gear is on firm terrain that can safely support  the weight of the helicopter. Accomplish this by slowly  moving the cyclic and pedals while lowering the collective.  If movement is detected, reposition the aircraft.  

# Takeoff  

A pinnacle takeoff is considered an airspeed over altitude  maneuver which can be made from the ground or from a  hover. Since pinnacles and ridgelines are generally higher  than the immediate surrounding terrain, gaining airspeed  on the takeoff is more important than gaining altitude. As  airspeed increases, the departure from the pinnacle becomes  more rapid, and helicopter time in the  avoid  area of the  height/velocity area decreases.  [Figure 11-3]  In addition  to covering unfavor­ able terrain rapidly, a higher airspeed  affords a more favorable glide angle and thus contributes to  the chances of reaching a safe area in the event of a forced  landing. If a suitable forced landing area is not avail­ able, a  higher airspeed also permits a more effective flare prior to  making an autorotative landing.  

On takeoff, as the helicopter moves out of ground effect,  maintain altitude and accelerate to normal climb airspeed.  When normal climb speed is attained, estab­ lish a normal  climb attitude. Never dive the helicopter down the slope after  clearing the pinnacle.  

# Common Errors

Failing to maintain proper rpm. 4.	 Failing to consider emergency landing areas. 5. 	 Failing to consider how wind and turbulence could  affect the approach and takeoff. 6.	 Failure to maintain pinnacle elevation after takeoff. 7.	 Failure to maintain proper approach rate of closure. 8.	 Failure to achieve climb airspeed in timely manner.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter described advanced flight maneuvers such  as slope landings, confined area landings, and running  takeoffs. The correlation between helicopter performance  requirements, the environmental factors associated with  different flight techniques, and safety considerations were  also explained to familiarize the pilot with the measures that  can be taken when performing these maneuvers to mitigate  risks. Hazards associated with helicopter flight and certain  aerodynamic considerations were also discussed.  

# Chapter 11 Helicopter Emergencies and  Hazards  

# Introduction  

Today, helicopters are quite reliable. However, emergencies  do occur, whether a result of mechanical failure or pilot  error, and should be anticipated. Regardless of the cause, the  recovery needs to be quick and precise. By having a thorough  knowledge of the helicopter and its systems, a pilot is able  to handle the situation more readily. Helicopter emergencies  and the proper recovery procedures should be discussed and,  when possible, practiced in flight. In addition, by knowing  the conditions that can lead to an emergency, many potential  accidents can be avoided.  

# Autorotation  

In a helicopter, an autorotative descent is a power-off  maneuver in which the engine is disengaged from the  main rotor disk and the rotor blades are driven solely by  the upward flow of air through the rotor.  [Figure 11-1]  In  other words, the engine is no longer supplying power to  the main rotor.  

The most common reason for an autorotation is failure of the  engine or drive line, but autorotation may also be performed  in the event of a complete tail rotor failure, since there is  virtually no torque produced in an autorotation. In both  cases, maintenance has often been a contributing factor to the  failure. Engine failures are also caused by fuel contamination  or exhaustion as well resulting in a forced autorotation.  

If the engine fails, the freewheeling unit automatically  disengages the engine from the main rotor, allowing it to  rotate freely. Essentially, the freewheeling unit disengages  anytime the engine revolutions per minute (rpm) is less than  the rotor rpm.  

At the instant of engine failure, the main rotor blades are  producing lift and thrust from their angle of attack (AOA)  and velocity. By lowering the collective (which must be done  immediately in case of an engine failure), lift and drag are  reduced, and the helicopter begins an immediate descent,  thus producing an upward flow of air through the rotor disk.  This upward flow of air through the rotor disk provides  sufficient thrust to maintain rotor rpm throughout the descent.  Since the tail rotor is driven by the main rotor transmission  during autorotation, heading control is maintained with the  antitorque pedals as in normal flight.  

Several factors affect the rate of descent in autorotation:  bank angle, density altitude, gross weight, rotor rpm, trim  condition, and airspeed. The primary ways to control the rate  of descent are with airspeed and rotor rpm. Higher or lower  airspeed is obtained with the cyclic pitch control just as in  normal powered flight. In theory, a pilot has a choice in the  angle of descent, varying, from straight vertical to maximum  horizontal range (which is the minimum angle of descent).  Rate of descent is high at zero airspeed and decreases to a  minimum at approximately 50–60 knots, depending upon the  particular helicopter and the factors just mentioned. As the  airspeed increases beyond that which gives minimum rate  of descent, the rate of descent increases again.  

When landing from an autorotation, the only energy available  to arrest the descent rate and ensure a soft landing is the  kinetic energy stored in the rotor blades. Tip weights can  greatly increase this stored energy. A greater amount of  rotor energy is required to stop a helicopter with a high  rate of descent than is required to stop a helicopter that is  descending more slowly. Therefore, autorotative descents  at very low or very high airspeeds are more critical than  those performed at the minimum rate of descent airspeed.  Refer to the height/velocity diagram discussion in Chapter  7, Helicopter Performance.  

Each type of helicopter has a specific airspeed and rotor rpm  at which a power-off glide is most efficient. The specific  airspeed is somewhat different for each type of helicopter,  but certain factors affect all configurations in the same  manner. In general, rotor rpm maintained in the low green  area (see  Figure 5-3 ) gives more distance in an autorotation.  Heavier helicopter weights may require more collective to  control rotor rpm. Some helicopters need slight adjustments  to minimum rotor rpm settings for winter versus summer  

![](images/80ef409e85363941cf0badbdb5ce90f94d25cd4c3e57706978f02f60dca7553c.jpg)

conditions, and high altitude versus sea level flights. For  specific autorotation airspeed and rotor rpm combinations for  a particular helicopter, refer to the Rotorcraft Flight Manual  (RFM). The specific airspeed and rotor rpm for autorotation  is established for each type of helicopter based on average  weather, calm wind conditions, and normal loading. When  the helicopter is operated with heavy loads in high density  altitude or gusty wind conditions, best performance is  achieved from a slightly increased airspeed in the descent.  For autorotation at low density altitude and light loading,  best performance is achieved from a slight decrease in  normal airspeed. Following this general procedure of fitting  airspeed and rotor rpm to existing conditions, a pilot can  achieve approximately the same glide angle in any set of  circumstances, and thereby estimate the touchdown point  accurately.  

It is important that pilots experience autorotations from  various airspeeds. This provides better understanding of  the necessary flight control inputs to achieve the desired  airspeed, rotor rpm and autorotation performance, such  as the maximum glide or minimum descent airspeed. The  decision to use the appropriate airspeed and rotor rpm for  the given conditions should be instinctive to reach a suitable  landing area. The helicopter glide ratio is much less than  that of a fixed-wing aircraft and takes some getting used to.  The flare to land at 80 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) will  be significantly greater than that from 55 KIAS. Rotor rpm  control is critical at these points to ensure adequate rotor  energy for cushioning the landing.  

Use collective pitch control to manage rotor rpm. If rotor rpm  builds too high during an autorotation, raise the collective  sufficiently to decrease rpm back to the normal operating  range, then reduce the collective to maintain proper rotor rpm.  If the collective increase is held too long, the rotor rpm may  decay rapidly. The pilot would have to lower the collective  in order to regain rotor rpm. If the rpm begins decreasing,  the pilot must again lower the collective. Always keep the  rotor rpm within the established recommended range for the  helicopter being flown.  

# RPM Control  

Rotor rpm in low inertia rotor systems has been studied  in simulator flight evaluations which indicate that the  simultaneous application of aft cyclic, down collective,  and alignment with the relative wind (trim) at a wide range  of airspeeds, including cruise airspeeds, is critical for all  operations during the entry of an autorotation. The applicable  Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) should be consulted to  determine the appropriate procedure(s) for safely entering an  autorotation. This is vitally important since the procedure(s)  for safely entering an autorotation may vary with specific  makes and/or models of helicopters. A basic discussion of  the aerodynamics and control inputs for single rotor systems  is in order here.  

Helicopter pilots must understand the use of the collective  for rotor rpm control during power off autorotations in a turn.  Upward movement of the collective reduces the rpm and  downward movement increases the rpm. Cyclic movement  is primarily associated with attitude/airspeed control in  powered flight but may not be given the credit appropriate  for rotor rpm control during practice and emergency power  off autorotations. As long as the line of cyclic movement is  parallel with the flight path of the helicopter (trimmed), the  aft movement of the cyclic also creates greater air flow up  through the bottom of the rotor disk and contributes to an  increase in rotor rpm. If the flight path is 10 degrees to the  right of the longitudinal axis of the helicopter, theoretically,  the cyclic should be moved 10 degrees aft and left of the  longitudinal axis to get maximum air up through the rotor  system.  

As the pilot lowers the collective in reaction to a loss of  power during cruise flight there may be a tendency for the  nose of the helicopter to pitch down. As a result, the pilot may  tend to lean forward slightly, which delays the application  of simultaneous aft cyclic to prevent the pitch change and  associated loss of rotor rpm. A slight gain in altitude at cruise  airspeed during the power off entry into an autorotation  should not be of great concern as is the case for the execution  of practice or actual quick stops.  

Various accident investigations have concluded that, when  faced with a real power failure at cruise airspeed, pilots are  not simultaneously applying down collective, aft cyclic, and  antitorque pedal inputs in a timely manner. Low inertia rotor  systems store less kinetic energy during autorotation and, as  a result, rotor rpm decays rapidly during deceleration and  touchdown. Conversely, less energy is required to regain  safe rotor rpm during autorotation entry and autorotative  descent. The pilot should immediately apply simultaneous  down collective, aft cyclic and trim the helicopter for entry  into an autorotation initiated at cruise airspeed. If rotor rpm  has been allowed to decrease, or has inadvertently decreased  below acceptable limits, an application of aft cyclic may  help rebuild rotor rpm. This application of aft cyclic must  be made at least at a moderate rate and may be combined  with a turn, either left or right, to increase airflow through  the rotor system. This will work to increase rotor rpm. Care  should be maintained to not over-speed the rotor system as  this is attempted.  

# Risk Management during Autorotation Training  

The following sections describe enhanced guidelines for  autorotations during rotorcraft/helicopter flight training,  as stated in Advisory Circular (AC) 61-140. There are  risks inherent in performing autorotations in the training  environment, and in particular the 180-degree autorotation.  This section describes an acceptable means, but not the  only means, of training applicants for a rotorcraft/helicopter  airman certificate to meet the qualifications for various  rotorcraft/helicopter ratings. You may use alternate methods  for training if you establish that those methods meet the  requirements of the Helicopter Flying Handbook (HFH),  FAA practical test standards (PTS), and the Rotorcraft Flight  Manual (RFM).  

# Straight-In Autorotation  

A straight-in autorotation is one made from altitude with  no turns. Winds have a great effect on an autorotation.  Strong headwinds cause the glide angle to be steeper due  to the slower groundspeed. For example, if the helicopter  is maintaining 60 KIAS and the wind speed is 15 knots,  then the groundspeed is 45 knots. The angle of descent will  be much steeper, although the rate of descent remains the  same. The speed at touchdown and the resulting ground run  depend on the groundspeed and amount of deceleration. The  greater the degree of deceleration, or flare, and the longer  it is held, the slower the touchdown speed and the shorter  the ground run. Caution must be exercised at this point as  the tail rotor will be the component of the helicopter closest  to the ground. If timing is not correct and a landing attitude  not set at the appropriate time, the tail rotor may contact the  ground causing a forward pitching moment of the nose and  possible damage to the helicopter.  

A headwind is a contributing factor in accomplishing a slow  touchdown from an autorotative descent and reduces the  amount of deceleration required. The lower the speed desired  at touchdown, the more accurate the timing and speed of the  flare must be, especially in helicopters with low-inertia rotor  disks. If too much collective is applied too early during the  final stages of the autorotation, the kinetic energy may be  depleted, resulting in little or no cushioning effect available.  This could result in a hard landing with corresponding  damage to the helicopter. It is generally better practice to  accept more ground run than a harder landing with minimal  groundspeed. As proficiency increases, the amount of ground  run may be reduced.  

# Technique (How to Practice)  

Refer to  Figure 11-2  (position 1). From level flight at  the appropriate airspeed (cruise or the manufacturer’s  recommended airspeed), 500–700 feet above ground level  (AGL), and heading into the wind, smoothly but firmly  lower the collective to the full down position. Use aft cyclic  to prevent a nose low attitude while maintaining rotor rpm  in the green arc with collective. If the collective is in the  full down position, the rotor rpm is then being controlled by  

![](images/344bf5a65da1afefb955840e82fa16b5b5567a91268e554529836dc79e8d8a9d.jpg)

the mechanical pitch stops. During maintenance, the rotor  stops must be set to allow minimum autorotational rpm with  a light loading. This means that collective will still be able  to be reduced even under conditions of extreme reduction of  vertical loading (e.g., very low helicopter weight, at very low- density altitude). After entering an autorotation, collective  pitch must be adjusted to maintain the desired rotor rpm.  

Coordinate the collective movement with proper antitorque  pedal for trim, and apply cyclic control to maintain proper  airspeed. Once the collective is fully lowered, decrease  throttle to ensure a clean split/separation of the needles. This  means that the rotor rpm increases to a rate higher than that of  the engine—a clear indication that the freewheeling unit has  allowed the engine to disconnect. After splitting the needles,  readjust the throttle to keep engine rpm above normal idling  speed, but not high enough to cause rejoining of the needles.  See the RFM for the manufacturer's recommendations for  autorotation rate of descent.  

At position 2, adjust attitude with cyclic to obtain the  manufacturer’s recommended autorotation (or best gliding)  speed. Adjust collective as necessary to maintain rotor rpm  in the lower part of the green arc (see page 11-2). Aft cyclic  movements cause an increase in rotor rpm, which is then  controlled by a small increase in collective. Avoid a large  collective increase, which results in a rapid decay of rotor  rpm, and leads to “chasing the rpm.” Avoid looking straight  down in front of the aircraft. Continually crosscheck attitude,  trim, rotor rpm, and airspeed.  

At the altitude recommended by the manufacturer (position  3), begin the flare with aft cyclic to reduce forward airspeed  and decrease the rate of descent. Maintain heading with the  antitorque pedals. During the flare, maintain rotor rpm in  the green range. In the execution of the flare, care must be  taken that the cyclic be moved rearward neither so abruptly  that it causes the helicopter to climb, nor so slowly that it  fails to arrest the descent, which may allow the helicopter  to settle so rapidly that the tail rotor strikes the ground. In  most helicopters, the proper flare attitude is that resulting in a  groundspeed of a slow run. When forward motion decreases  to the desired groundspeed—usually the lowest possible  speed (position 4)—move the cyclic forward to place the  helicopter in the proper attitude for landing.  

This action gives the student an idea of airframe attitude to  avoid, because a pilot should never allow ground contact  unless the helicopter is more nose-low than that attitude.  Limiting the flare to that attitude may result in slightly faster  touchdown speeds but will eliminate the possibility of tail  rotor impact on level surfaces.  

The landing gear height at this time should be approximately  3–15 feet AGL, depending on the altitude recommended by  the manufacturer. As the apparent groundspeed and altitude  decrease, the helicopter must be returned to a more level  attitude for touchdown by applying forward cyclic. Some  helicopters can be landed on the heels in a slightly nose high  attitude to help decrease the forward groundspeed, whereas  others must land skids or landing gear level, in order to spread  the landing loads equally to all of the landing gear. Extreme  caution should be used to avoid an excessive nose high and  tail low attitude below 10 feet. The helicopter must be close  to the landing attitude to keep the tail rotor from contacting  the surface.  

At this point, if a full touchdown landing is to be performed,  allow the helicopter to descend vertically (position 5). This  collective application uses some of the kinetic energy in the  rotor disk to help slow the descent rate of the helicopter.  When the collective is raised, the opposite antitorque pedal  used in powered flight will be needed due to the friction  within the transmission/drive train. Touch down in a level  flight attitude.  

Control response with increased pitch angles will be slightly  different than normal. With a decrease in main rotor rpm,  the antitorque authority is reduced (the pedals react more  slowly), requiring larger control inputs to maintain heading  at touchdown.  

Some helicopters, such as the Schweitzer 300, have a canted  tail stabilizer. With a canted stabilizer, it is crucial that the  pilot apply the appropriate pedal input at all times during the  autorotation. If not the tailboom tends to swing to the right,  which allows the canted stabilizer to raise the tail. This can  result in a severe nose tuck which is quickly corrected with  right pedal application.  

A power recovery can be made during training in lieu of a full  touchdown landing. Refer to the section on power recovery  for the correct technique.  

After the helicopter has come to a complete stop after  touchdown, lower the collective pitch to the full-down  position. Do not try to stop the forward ground run with aft  cyclic, as the main rotor blades can strike the tail boom. By  lowering the collective slightly during the ground run, an  increase in weight is placed on the landing carriage, slowing  the helicopter; however, this is dependent on the condition  of the landing surface.  

One common error is the holding of the helicopter off the  surface, versus cushioning it onto the surface during an  autorotation. Holding the helicopter in the air by using all of  the rotor rpm kinetic energy usually causes the helicopter to  have a hard landing, which results in the blades flexing down  and contacting the tail boom. The rotor rpm should be used  to cushion the helicopter on to the surface for a controlled,  smooth landing instead of allowing the helicopter to drop  the last few inches.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Not understanding the importance of an immediate  entry into autorotation upon powerplant or driveline  failure.  2.	 Failing to use sufficient antitorque pedal when power  is reduced. 3.	 Lowering the nose too abruptly when power is  reduced, thus placing the helicopter in a dive. 4.	 Failing to maintain proper rotor rpm during the  descent. 5.	 Applying up-collective pitch at an excessive altitude,  resulting in a hard landing, loss of heading control,  and possible damage to the tail rotor and main rotor  blade stops. 6. 	 Failing to level the helicopter or achieve the  manufacturers preferred landing attitude. 7.	 Failing to minimize or eliminate lateral movement  during ground contact. (Similar for items 8 and 9) 8.	 Failing to maintain ground track in the air and keeping  the landing gear aligned with the direction of travel  during touchdown and ground contact. 9. 	 Failing (in a practice run) to go around if not within  limits and specified criteria for safe autorotation.  

# Autorotation with Turns  

Turns (or a series of turns) can be made during autorotation  to facilitate landing into the wind or avoiding obstacles.  Turns during autorotation should be made early so that the  remainder of the autorotation is flown identically to a straight- in autorotation. The most common turns in an autorotation  are 90 degrees and 180 degrees. The following technique  describes an autorotation with a 180-degree turn.  

The pilot establishes the aircraft on a downwind heading  at the recommended airspeed, and parallel to the intended  touchdown point. Then, taking the wind into account, the pilot  establishes the ground track approximately 200 feet laterally  from the desired course line to the touchdown point. In strong  crosswind conditions, the pilot should be prepared to adjust  the downwind leg closer or farther out, as appropriate. The  pilot uses the autorotation entry airspeed recommended by  the RFM. When abeam the intended touchdown point, the  pilot smoothly reduces collective, then reduces power to the  engine to show a split between the rotor rpm and engine rpm  and simultaneously applies appropriate anti-torque pedal  and cyclic to maintain proper attitude/airspeed. Throughout  the autorotation, the pilot should continually crosscheck the  helicopter’s attitude, rotor rpm, airspeed, and verify that the  helicopter is in trim (centered trim ball).  

After the descent and autorotation airspeed is established, the  pilot initiates the 180-degree turn. For training operations,  initially roll into a bank of at least 30 degrees, but no more  than 60 degrees. It is important to maintain the proper  airspeed, rotor rpm, and trim (centered trim ball) throughout  the turn. Changes in the helicopter’s attitude and the angle  of bank causes a corresponding change in rotor rpm within  normal limits. Do not allow the nose to pitch up or down  excessively during the maneuver, as it may cause undesirable  rotor rpm excursions.  

Pitot-static airspeed indications may be unreliable or lag  during an autorotational turn. The pilot should exercise  caution to avoid using excessive aircraft pitch attitudes and to  avoid chasing airspeed indications in an autorotational turn.  

Note: Approaching the 90-degree point, check the position of  the landing area. The second 90 degrees of the turn should  end with a roll-out on a course line to the landing area. If the  helicopter is too close, decrease the bank angle (to increase  the radius of turn); if too far out, increase the bank angle  (to decrease the radius of the turn). A bank angle of no more  than 60 degrees should be encountered during this turn.  Monitor the trim ball (along with one’s kinesthetic sense)  and adjust as necessary with cyclic and anti-torque pedal  to maintain coordinated flight. Prior to passing through  200 feet above ground level (AGL), if landing or making a  surface-level power recovery, the turn should be completed,  and the helicopter aligned with the intended touchdown  area. Upon reaching the course line, set the appropriate  crosswind correction. If the collective pitch was increased  to control the rpm, it may need to be lowered on rollout to  prevent decay in rotor rpm.  

This maneuver should be aborted at any point the following  criteria is not met: if the helicopter is not in a stabilized  approach to landing profile (i.e., it is not aligned as close  as possible into the wind with the touchdown point, after  completing the 180-degree turn); if the rotor rpm is not within  limits; if the helicopter is not at a proper attitude/airspeed; or  if the helicopter is not under proper control at 200 feet AGL.  It is essential that the pilot on the controls (or a certificated  flight instructor (CFI), when intervening) immediately abort  the maneuver and execute a smooth power recovery and go- around. It is important for the CFI who is intervening at this  point to remember that the go-around is a far safer option than  trying to recover lost rotor rpm and reestablish or recover to  the hover or even the preferred hover taxi.  

From all entry positions, but particularly true of the  180-degree entry, a primary concern is getting the aircraft  into the course line with as much altitude as possible. Once  the collective has been lowered and the engine set to flight  idle, the helicopter will lose altitude. A delayed turn will  result in a lower altitude when arriving on the course line.  Additionally, an uncoordinated flight condition (trim-ball  not centered) results in an increased sink rate, which may  be unrecoverable if not corrected.  

During the turn to the course line, the pilot should use a  scan pattern to see outside as well as inside the cockpit. Of  primary importance outside is maintaining the appropriate  descending attitude and a proper turn rate. Essential items to  scan inside are rotor rpm and centered trim ball. Rotor rpm  will build anytime “G” forces are applied to the rotor system.  Usually, this occurs in the turn to the course line and during  the deceleration flare.  

Throughout the maneuver, rotor rpm should be maintained  in the range recommended in the RFM. Rotor rpm outside  of the recommended range results in a higher rate of descent  and less glide-ratio. When the rotor rpm exceeds the desired  value as a result of increased G load in the turn, timely  use of up collective will increase the pitch of the blades  and slow the rotor to the desired rpm. In an autorotation,  rotor rpm is the most critical element, as it provides the lift  required to stabilize an acceptable rate of descent and the  energy necessary to cushion the landing. Collective should  be lowered to the full down position to maintain rotor rpm  immediately following a loss of power. However, rapid or  abrupt collective movement could lead to mast bumping in  some rotorcraft with teetering rotor systems.  

Energy is a very important property of all rotating  components, and the kinetic energy stored in the rotor system  is used to cushion the landing. More lift is produced at the  bottom of an autorotation by raising the collective, which  increases the angle of attack of the blades. The rotor rpm will  also rapidly decay at this point and it is essential to properly  time the flare and the final collective pull to fully arrest the  descent and cushion the landing. Upon arriving into the  course line prior to the flare, the scan should focus almost  entirely outside. The scan should include:  

•	 The horizon for attitude, ground track, and nose  alignment;  •	 the altitude to set the flare and for closure (groundspeed);  and  •	 the instrument cross-check of airspeed, rotor rpm, and  engine rpm in the descent.  

Every autorotational flare will be different depending on the  existing wind conditions, airspeed, density altitude (DA),  and the aircraft gross weight. A pilot operating a helicopter  at a high DA needs to take into account the effects on the  control of the helicopter when recovering from an aborted  autorotation.  

Some effects to consider are:  

•	 Higher rate of descent.  •	 Reduced rotor rpm builds in autorotation.  •	 Low initial rotor rpm response in autorotation.  •	 The requirement for a higher flare height.  •	 Reduced engine power performance.  

# Common Errors  

The following common errors should be prevented:  

1.	 Entering the maneuver at an improper altitude or  airspeed.  2.	 Entering the maneuver without a level attitude (or not  in coordinated flight).  3.	 Entering the maneuver and not correcting from the  initial deceleration to a steady state attitude (which  allows excessive airspeed loss in the descent).  4.	 Improper transition into the descent on entry.  5.	 Improper use of anti-torque on entry.  6.	 Failure to establish the appropriate crosswind  correction, allowing the aircraft to drift.  7.	 Failure to maintain coordinated flight through the tum.  

8.	 Failure to maintain rotor rpm within the RFM  recommended range.  9.	 Excessive yaw when increasing collective to slow rate  of descent during power recovery autorotations.  10.	 During power recovery autorotations, a delay in  reapplying power.  11.	 Initial collective pull either too high or too low.  12.	 Improper flare (too much or not enough).  13.	 Flaring too low or too high (AGL).  14.	 Failure to maintain heading when reapplying power.  15.	 Not landing with a level attitude.  16.	 Landing with aircraft not aligned with the direction  of travel.  17.	 Insufficient collective cushioning during full  autorotations.  18.	 Abrupt control inputs on touchdown during full  autorotations.  

# Practice Autorotation with a Power Recovery  

A power recovery is used to terminate practice autorotations  at a point prior to actual touchdown. After the power  recovery, a landing can be made or a go-around initiated.  

# Technique (How to Practice)  

At approximately 3–15 feet landing gear height AGL,  depending upon the helicopter being used, begin to level the  helicopter with forward cyclic control. Avoid excessive nose- high, tail-low attitude below 10 feet. Just prior to achieving  level attitude, with the nose still slightly up, coordinate  upward collective pitch control with an increase in the  throttle to join the needles at operating rpm. The throttle and  collective pitch must be coordinated properly.  

If the throttle is increased too fast or too much, an engine  overspeed can occur; if throttle is increased too slowly or too  little in proportion to the increase in collective pitch, a loss of  rotor rpm results. Use sufficient collective pitch to stop the  descent, but keep in mind that the collective pitch application  must be gradual to allow for engine response. Coordinate  proper antitorque pedal pressure to maintain heading. When  a landing is to be made following the power recovery, bring  the helicopter to a hover and then descend to a landing.  

In nearly all helicopters, when practicing autorotations with  power recovery, the throttle should be at the flight setting at  the beginning of the flare. As the rotor disk begins to dissipate  its energy, the engine is up to speed as the needles join when  the rotor decreases into the normal flight rpm.  

Helicopters that do not have the throttle control located on  the collective are generally exceptions to basic technique  and require some additional prudence. The autorotation  should be initiated with the power levers left in the “flight,”  or normal, position. If a full touchdown is to be practiced, it  is common technique to move the power levers to the idle  position once the landing area can safely be reached. In most  helicopters, the pilot is fully committed at that point to make  a power-off landing. However, it may be possible to make  a power recovery prior to passing through 100 feet AGL if  the powerplant can recover within that time period and the  instructor is very proficient. The pilot should comply with  the RFM instructions in all cases.  

When practicing autorotations to a power recovery, the  differences between reciprocating engines and turbines  may be profound. The reciprocating powerplant generally  responds very quickly to power changes, especially power  increases. Some turbines have delay times depending on  the type of fuel control or governing system installed. Any  reciprocating engine needing turbocharged boost to develop  rated horse power may have significant delays to demands  for increased power, such as in the power recovery. Power  recovery in those helicopters with slower engine response  times must have the engines begin to develop enough power  to rejoin the needles by approximately 100 feet AGL.  

If a go-around is to be made, the cyclic control should be  moved forward to resume forward flight. In transition from  a practice autorotation to a go-around, exercise caution to  avoid an altitude-airspeed combination that would place the  helicopter in an unsafe area of its height/velocity diagram.  

This is one of the most difficult maneuvers to perform due to  the concentration needed when transitioning from powered  flight to autorotation and then back again to powered flight.  For helicopters equipped with the power control on the  collective, engine power must be brought from flight power  to idle power and then back to a flight power setting. A delay  during any of these transitions can seriously affect rotor rpm  placing the helicopter in a situation that cannot be recovered.  

The cyclic must be adjusted to maintain the required  airspeed without power, and then used for the deceleration  flare, followed by the transition to level hovering flight.  Additionally, the cyclic must be adjusted to remove the  compensation for translating tendency. The tail rotor is  no longer needed to produce antitorque thrust until almost  maximum power is applied to the rotor disk for hovering  flight, when the tail rotor must again compensate for the main  rotor torque, which also demands compensation for the tail  rotor thrust and translating tendency.  

The pedals must be adjusted from a powered flight anti- torque trim setting to the opposite trim setting to compensate  for transmission drag and any unneeded vertical fin thrust  countering the now nonexistent torque and then reset to  compensate for the high power required for hovering flight.  

All of the above must be accomplished during the 23 seconds  of the autorotation, and the quick, precise control inputs must  be made in the last 5 seconds of the maneuver.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Initiating recovery too late, which requires a rapid  application of controls and results in overcontrolling. 2.	 Failure to obtain and maintain a level attitude near the  surface. 3.	 Failure to coordinate throttle and collective pitch  properly, which results in either an engine overspeed  or a loss of rotor rpm. 4.	 Failure to coordinate proper antitorque pedal with the  increase in power. 5.	 Late engine power engagement causing excessive  temperature or torque, or rpm drop. 6.	 Failure to go around if not within limits and specified  criteria for safe autorotation.  

# Practicing Power Failure in a Hover  

Power failure in a hover, also called hovering autorotation, is  practiced so that a pilot can automatically make the correct  response when confronted with engine stoppage or certain  other emergencies while hovering. The techniques discussed  in this section are for helicopters with a counterclockwise  rotor disk and an antitorque rotor.  

# Technique (How to Practice)  

To practice hovering autorotation, establish a normal  hovering height (approximately 2–3 feet) for the particular  helicopter being used, considering load and atmospheric  conditions. Keep the helicopter headed into the wind and  hold maximum allowable rpm.  

To simulate a power failure, firmly roll the throttle to the  engine idle position. This disengages the driving force of the  engine from the rotor, thus eliminating torque effect. As the  throttle is closed, apply proper antitorque pedal to maintain  heading. Usually, a slight amount of right cyclic control is  necessary to keep the helicopter from drifting to the left, to  compensate for the loss of tail rotor thrust. However, use  cyclic control, as required, to ensure a vertical descent and  a level attitude. Do not adjust the collective on entry.  

Helicopters with low inertia rotor disks settle immediately.  Keep a level attitude and ensure a vertical descent with cyclic  control while maintaining heading with the pedals. Any lateral  movement must be avoided to prevent dynamic rollover. As  rotor rpm decays, cyclic response decreases, so compensation  for the winds will require more cyclic input. At approximately  1 foot AGL, apply upward collective control, as necessary,  to slow the descent and cushion the landing without arresting  the rate of descent above the surface. Usually, the full amount  of collective is required just as the landing gear touches the  surface. As upward collective control is applied, the throttle  must be held in the idle detent position to prevent the engine  from re-engaging. The idle detention position is a ridged stop  position between idle and off in which the idle release button  snaps into, prevent accidental throttle off.  

Helicopters with high-inertia rotor disks settle more slowly  after the throttle is closed. In this case, when the helicopter has  settled to approximately 1 foot AGL, apply upward collective  control while holding the throttle in the idle detent position  to slow the descent and cushion the landing. The timing of  collective control application and the rate at which it is applied  depend upon the particular helicopter being used, its gross  weight, and the existing atmospheric conditions. Cyclic control  is used to maintain a level attitude and to ensure a vertical  descent. Maintain heading with antitorque pedals.  

When the weight of the helicopter is entirely resting on  the landing gear, cease application of upward collective.  When the helicopter has come to a complete stop, lower the  collective pitch to the full-down position.  

The timing of the collective movement is a very important  consideration. If it is applied too soon, the remaining rpm may  not be sufficient to make a soft landing. On the other hand,  if it is applied too late, surface contact may be made before  sufficient blade pitch is available to cushion the landing.  The collective must not be used to hold the helicopter off  the surface, causing a blade stall. Low rotor rpm and ensuing  blade stall can result in a total loss of rotor lift, allowing the  helicopter to fall to the surface and possibly resulting in blade  strikes to the tail boom and other airframe damage such as  landing gear damage, transmission mount deformation, and  fuselage cracking.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to use sufficient proper antitorque pedal when  power is reduced. 2.	 Failure to stop all sideward or backward movement  prior to touchdown. 3.	 Failure to apply up-collective pitch properly, resulting  in a hard touchdown.  

4.	 Failure to touch down in a level attitude.  5.	 Failure to roll the throttle completely to idle. 6.	 Failure to hover at a safe altitude for the helicopter  type, atmospheric conditions, and the level of training/ proficiency of the pilot. 7. 	 Failure to go around if not within limits and specified  criteria for safe autorotation.  

# Vortex Ring State  

Vortex ring state (formerly referenced as settling-with- power) describes an aerodynamic condition in which a  helicopter may be in a vertical descent with 20 percent up to  maximum power applied, and little or no climb performance.  The previously used term settling-with-power came from the  fact that the helicopter keeps settling even though full engine  power is applied.  

In a normal out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hover, the helicopter  is able to remain stationary by propelling a large mass of air  down through the main rotor. Some of the air is recirculated  near the tips of the blades, curling up from the bottom of  the rotor disk and rejoining the air entering the rotor from  the top. This phenomenon is common to all airfoils and is  known as tip vortices. Tip vortices generate drag and degrade  airfoil efficiency. As long as the tip vortices are small, their  only effect is a small loss in rotor efficiency. However, when  the helicopter begins to descend vertically, it settles into its  own downwash, which greatly enlarges the tip vortices. In  this vortex ring state, most of the power developed by the  engine is wasted in circulating the air in a doughnut pattern  around the rotor.  

In addition, the helicopter may descend at a rate that exceeds  the normal downward induced-flow rate of the inner blade  sections. As a result, the airflow of the inner blade sections is  upward relative to the disk. This produces a secondary vortex  ring in addition to the normal tip vortices. The secondary  vortex ring is generated about the point on the blade where the  airflow changes from up to down. The result is an unsteady  turbulent flow over a large area of the disk. Rotor efficiency  is lost even though power is still being supplied from the  engine.  [Figure 11-3]  

A fully developed vortex ring state is characterized by an  unstable condition in which the helicopter experiences  uncommanded pitch and roll oscillations, has little or no  collective authority, and achieves a descent rate that may  approach 6,000 feet per minute (fpm) if allowed to develop.  

A vortex ring state may be entered during any maneuver  that places the main rotor in a condition of descending in a  column of disturbed air and low forward airspeed. Airspeeds  

![](images/be35b02a3a4cf27558f91c6305f890928b6cb1b4c96d4dfb6fbf02788de2c7e6.jpg)  
Figure 11-3.  Vortex ring state.  

that are below translational lift airspeeds are within this  region of susceptibility to vortex ring state aerodynamics.  This condition is sometimes seen during quick-stop type  maneuvers or during recovery from autorotation.  

The following combination of conditions is likely to cause  settling in a vortex ring state in any helicopter:  

1.	 A vertical or nearly vertical descent of at least 300  fpm. (Actual critical rate depends on the gross weight,  rpm, density altitude, and other pertinent factors.) 2.	 The rotor disk must be using some of the available  engine power (20–100 percent). 3. 	 The horizontal velocity must be slower than effective  translational lift.  

Situations that are conducive to a vortex ring state condition  are attempting to hover OGE without maintaining precise  altitude control, and approaches, especially steep approaches,  with a tailwind component.  

When recovering from a vortex ring state condition, the pilot  tends first to try to stop the descent by increasing collective  pitch. However, this only results in increasing the stalled  area of the rotor, thereby increasing the rate of descent. Since  inboard portions of the blades are stalled, cyclic control  may be limited. The traditional recovery is accomplished  by increasing airspeed, and/or partially lowering collective  to exit the vortex. In most helicopters, lateral cyclic thrust  combined with an increase in power and lateral antitorque  thrust will produce the quickest exit from the hazard. This  technique, known as the Vuichard Recovery (named after the  Swiss examiner from the Federal Office of Civil Aviation  who developed it) recovers by eliminating the descent rate as  opposed to exiting the vortex. If the vortex ring state and the  corresponding descent rate is allowed to progress to what is  called the windmill brake state, the point where the airflow  is completely up through the rotor, the only recovery may  be an autorotation.  

Tandem rotor helicopters should maneuver laterally to  achieve clean air in both rotors at the same time.  

For vortex ring state demonstrations and training in  recognition and recovery should be performed from a safe  altitude to allow recovery no less than 1000 feet AGL or the  manufacturer’s recommended altitude, whichever is higher.  

To enter the maneuver, come to an OGE hover, maintaining  little or no airspeed (any direction), decrease collective  to begin a vertical descent, and as the turbulence begins,  increase collective. Then allow the sink rate to increase to 300  fpm or more as the attitude is adjusted to obtain airspeed of  less than 10 knots. When the aircraft begins to shudder, the  application of additional up collective increases the vibration  and sink rate. As the power is increased, the rate of sink of  the aircraft in the column of air will increase.  

If altitude is sufficient, some time can be spent in the  vortices, to enable the pilot to develop a healthy knowledge  of the maneuver. However, helicopter pilots would normally  initiate recovery at the first indication of vortex ring state.  Recovery should be initiated at the first sign of vortex ring  state by applying forward cyclic to increase airspeed and/ or  simultaneously reducing collective. The recovery is complete  when the aircraft passes through effective translational lift  and a normal climb is established.  

# Common Errors—Traditional Recovery  

1.	 Too much lateral speed for entry into vortex ring state. 2.	 Excessive decrease of collective.  

# Common Errors—Vuichard Recovery  

1.	 Excessive lateral cyclic 2.	 Failure to maintain heading  

# Retreating Blade Stall  

In forward flight, the relative airflow through the main rotor  disk is different on the advancing and retreating side. The  relative airflow over the advancing side is higher due to the  forward speed of the helicopter, while the relative airflow on  the retreating side is lower. This dissymmetry of lift increases  as forward speed increases.  

To generate the same amount of lift across the rotor disk,  the advancing blade flaps up while the retreating blade flaps  down. This causes the AOA to decrease on the advancing  blade, which reduces lift, and increase on the retreating blade,  which increases lift. At some point as the forward speed  increases, the low blade speed on the retreating blade, and  its high AOA cause a stall and loss of lift.  

Retreating blade stall is a factor in limiting a helicopter’s  never-exceed speed   $\left({{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{NE}}}\right)$   and its development can be felt  by a low frequency vibration, pitching up of the nose, and  a roll in the direction of the retreating blade. High weight,  low rotor rpm, high density altitude, turbulence and/or  steep, abrupt turns are all conducive to retreating blade stall  at high forward airspeeds. As altitude is increased, higher  blade angles are required to maintain lift at a given airspeed.  Thus, retreating blade stall is encountered at a lower forward  airspeed at altitude. Most manufacturers publish charts and  graphs showing a  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   decrease with altitude.  

When recovering from a retreating blade stall condition  caused by high airspeed, moving the cyclic aft only worsens  the stall as aft cyclic produces a flare effect, thus increasing  the AOA. Pushing forward on the cyclic also deepens  the stall as the AOA on the retreating blade is increased.  While the first step in a proper recovery is usually to reduce  collective, RBS should be evaluated in light of the relevant  factors discussed in the previous paragraph and addressed  accordingly. For example, if a pilot at high weight and high  DA is about to conduct a high reconnaissance prior to a  confined area operation where rolling into a steep turn causes  onset of RBS, the recovery is to roll out of the turn. If the  cause is low rotor rpm, then increase the rpm.  

# Common Errors  

1.	 Failure to recognize the combination of contributing  factors leading to retreating blade stall.  

2.	 Failure to compute  $\mathrm{V_{NE}}$   limits for altitudes to be flown.  

# Ground Resonance  

Helicopters with articulating rotors (usually designs with  three or more main rotor blades) are subject to ground  resonance, a destructive vibration phenomenon that occurs  at certain rotor speeds when the helicopter is on the ground.  Ground resonance is a mechanical design issue that results  from the helicopter’s airframe having a natural frequency that  can be intensified by an out-of-balance rotor. The unbalanced  rotor disk vibrates at the same frequency (or multiple thereof)  of the airframe’s resonant frequency, and the harmonic  oscillation increases because the engine is adding power  to the system, increasing the magnitude (amplitude) of the  vibrations until the structure or structures fail. This condition  can cause a helicopter to self-destruct in a matter of seconds.  

Hard contact with the ground on one corner (and usually  with wheel-type landing gear) can send a shockwave to  the main rotor head, resulting in the blades of a three-blade  rotor disk moving from their normal   $120^{\circ}$   relationship to  each other. This movement occurs along the drag hinge and  could result in something like  $122^{\circ}.$  ,  $122^{\circ}$  , and   $116^{\circ}$   between  blades.  [Figure 11-4]  When another part of the landing gear  strikes the surface, the unbalanced condition could be further  aggravated.  

If the rpm is low, the only corrective action to stop ground  resonance is to close the throttle immediately and fully lower  the collective to place the blades in low pitch. If the rpm is in  the normal operating range, fly the helicopter off the ground,  and allow the blades to rephase themselves automatically.  Then, make a normal touchdown. If a pilot lifts off and allows  the helicopter to firmly re-contact the surface before the  blades are realigned, a second shock could move the blades  again and aggravate the already unbalanced condition. This  could lead to a violent, uncontrollable oscillation.  

This situation does not occur in rigid or semi-rigid rotor  disks because there is no drag hinge. In addition, skid-type  landing gear is not as prone to ground resonance as wheel- type landing gear, since the rubber tires' resonant frequency  typically can match that of the spinning rotor, unlike the  condition of a rigid landing gear.  

# Dynamic Rollover  

A helicopter is susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency,  called dynamic rollover, when it is in contact with the surface  

![](images/228194d4adbfbcbcf4bd42453845cbc9836e129e4e1e079578f8c15403397cbc.jpg)  
Figure 11-4.  Ground resonance.  

during takeoffs or landings. For dynamic rollover to occur,  some factor must first cause the helicopter to roll or pivot  around a skid or landing gear wheel, until its critical rollover  angle is reached. The angle at which dynamic rollover  occurs will vary based on helicopter type. Then, beyond  this point, main rotor thrust continues the roll and recovery  is impossible. After this angle is achieved, the cyclic does  not have sufficient range of control to eliminate the thrust  component and convert it to lift. If the critical rollover angle  is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the  cyclic corrections made.  

Dynamic rollover begins when the helicopter starts to pivot  laterally around its skid or wheel. For dynamic rollover to  occur the following three factors must be present:  

1.	 A rolling moment 2.	 A pivot point other than the helicopter’s normal CG 3.	 Thrust greater than weight  

This can occur for a variety of reasons, including the failure  to remove a tie down or skid-securing device, or if the skid  or wheel contacts a fixed object while hovering sideward,  or if the gear is stuck in ice, soft asphalt, or mud. Dynamic  rollover may also occur if you use an improper landing or  takeoff technique or while performing slope operations.  Whatever the cause, dynamic rollover is possible if not using  the proper corrective technique.  

Once started, dynamic rollover cannot be stopped by  application of opposite cyclic control alone. For example,  the right skid contacts an object and becomes the pivot point  while the helicopter starts rolling to the right. Even with full  left cyclic applied, the main rotor thrust vector and its moment  follows the aircraft as it continues rolling to the right. Quickly  reducing collective pitch is the most effective way to stop  dynamic rollover from developing. Dynamic rollover can  occur with any type of landing gear and all types of rotor disks.  

It is important to remember rotor blades have a limited range  of movement. If the tilt or roll of the helicopter exceeds that  range  $\scriptstyle(5-8^{\circ})$  , the controls (cyclic) can no longer command a  vertical lift component and the thrust or lift becomes a lateral  force that rolls the helicopter over. When limited rotor blade  movement is coupled with the fact that most of a helicopter’s  weight is high in the airframe, another element of risk is added  to an already slightly unstable center of gravity. Pilots must  remember that in order to remove thrust, the collective must  be lowered as this is the only recovery technique available.  

# Critical Conditions  

Certain conditions reduce the critical rollover angle, thus  increasing the possibility for dynamic rollover and reducing  the chance for recovery. The rate of rolling motion is also  a consideration because, as the roll rate increases, there is  a reduction of the critical rollover angle at which recovery  is still possible. Other critical conditions include operating  at high gross weights with thrust (lift) approximately equal  to the weight.  

Refer to  Figure 11-5.  The following conditions are most  critical for helicopters with counterclockwise rotor rotation:  

1.	 Right side skid or landing wheel down, since  translating tendency adds to the rollover force. 2.	 Right lateral center of gravity (CG). 3.	 Crosswinds from the left. 4.	 Left yaw inputs.  

For helicopters with clockwise rotor rotation, the opposite  conditions would be true.  

# Cyclic Trim  

When maneuvering with one skid or wheel on the ground,  care must be taken to keep the helicopter cyclic control  carefully adjusted. For example, if a slow takeoff is attempted  and the cyclic is not positioned and adjusted to account for  translating tendency, the critical recovery angle may be  exceeded in less than two seconds. Control can be maintained  if the pilot maintains proper cyclic position and does not  allow the helicopter’s roll and pitch rates to become too  great. Fly the helicopter into the air smoothly while keeping  movements of pitch, roll, and yaw small; do not allow any  abrupt cyclic pressures.  

![](images/27058794360b74e6d8395d7461ccc81568e7755b5531d5fa1a7f96d9b4f3a8b5.jpg)  
Figure 11-5.  Forces acting on a helicopter with right skid on the  ground.  

# Normal Takeoffs and Landings  

Dynamic rollover is possible even during normal takeoffs and  landings on relatively level ground, if one wheel or skid is on  the ground and thrust (lift) is approximately equal to the weight  of the helicopter. If the takeoff or landing is not performed  properly, a roll rate could develop around the wheel or skid  that is on the ground. When taking off or landing, perform the  maneuver smoothly and carefully adjust the cyclic so that no  pitch or roll movement rates build up, especially the roll rate.  If the bank angle starts to increase to an angle of approximately   $5–8^{\circ}$  , and full corrective cyclic does not reduce the angle, the  collective should be reduced to diminish the unstable rolling  condition. Excessive bank angles can also be caused by landing  gear caught in a tie down strap, or a tie down strap still attached  to one side of the helicopter. Lateral loading imbalance (usually  outside published limits) is another contributing factor.  

# Slope Takeoffs and Landings  

During slope operations, excessive application of cyclic  control into the slope, together with excessive collective pitch  control, can result in the downslope skid or landing wheel  rising sufficiently to exceed lateral cyclic control limits, and  an upslope rolling motion can occur.  [Figure 11-6]  

When performing slope takeoff and landing maneuvers, follow  the published procedures and keep the roll rates small. Slowly  raise the downslope skid or wheel to bring the helicopter level,  and then lift off. During landing, first touch down on the  upslope skid or wheel, then slowly lower the downslope skid  or wheel using combined movements of cyclic and collective.  If the helicopter rolls approximately  $5–8^{\circ}$   to the upslope side,  decrease collective to correct the bank angle and return to level  attitude, then start the landing procedure again.  

# Use of Collective  

The collective is more effective in controlling the rolling  motion than lateral cyclic, because it reduces the main rotor  

![](images/2777c83a4574165dd5a4fc4a88c88478311edad9dfe22253724dadbe91ac877d.jpg)  
Figure 11-6.  Upslope rolling motion.  

thrust (lift). A smooth, moderate collective reduction, at a  rate of less than approximately full up to full down in two  seconds, may be adequate to stop the rolling motion. Take  care, therefore, not to dump collective at an excessively high  rate, as this may cause a main rotor blade to strike the fuselage.  Additionally, if the helicopter is on a slope and the roll starts  toward the upslope side, reducing collective too fast may create  a high roll rate in the opposite direction. When the upslope skid  or wheel hits the ground, the dynamics of the motion can cause  the helicopter to bounce off the upslope skid or wheel, and the  inertia can cause the helicopter to roll about the downslope  ground contact point and over on its side.  [Figure 11-7]  

Under normal conditions on a slope, the collective should  not be pulled suddenly to get airborne because a large and  abrupt rolling moment in the opposite direction could occur.  Excessive application of collective can result in the upslope  skid or wheel rising sufficiently to exceed lateral cyclic  control limits. This movement may be uncontrollable. If the  helicopter develops a roll rate with one skid or wheel on the  ground, the helicopter can roll over on its side.  

# Precautions  

To help avoid dynamic rollover:  

1.	 Always practice hovering autorotations into the wind,  and be wary when the wind is gusty or greater than 10  knots. 2.	 Use extreme caution when hovering close to fences,  sprinklers, bushes, runway/taxi lights, tiedown cables,  deck nets, or other obstacles that could catch a skid or  wheel. Aircraft parked on hot asphalt overnight might  find the landing gear sunk in and stuck as the ramp  cooled during the evening.

Figure 11-7.  Downslope rolling motion.  

3.	 Always use a two-step lift-off. Pull in just enough  collective pitch control to be light on the skids  or landing wheels and feel for equilibrium, then  gently lift the helicopter into the air. 4.	 Hover high enough to have adequate skid or landing  wheel clearance from any obstacles when practicing  hovering maneuvers close to the ground, especially  when practicing sideways or rearward flight.  

5.	 Remember that when the wind is coming from  the upslope direction, less lateral cyclic control is  available.  

6.	 Avoid tailwind conditions when conducting slope  operations.  

7.	 Remember that less lateral cyclic control is available  due to the translating tendency of the tail rotor when  the left skid or landing wheel is upslope. (This is true  for counterclockwise rotor disks.)  

8.	 Keep in mind that the lateral cyclic requirement changes  when passengers or cargo are loaded or unloaded.  

9.	 Be aware that if the helicopter utilizes interconnecting  fuel lines that allow fuel to automatically transfer from  one side of the helicopter to the other, the gravitational  flow of fuel to the downslope tank could change the  CG, resulting in a different amount of cyclic control  application to obtain the same lateral result.  

10.	 Do not allow the cyclic limits to be reached. If the  cyclic control limit is reached, further lowering of the  collective may cause mast bumping. If this occurs,  return to a hover and select a landing point with a  lesser degree of slope.  

11. 	During a takeoff from a slope, begin by leveling the  main rotor disk with the horizon or very slightly into  the slope to ensure vertical lift and only enough lateral  thrust to prevent sliding on the slope. If the upslope  skid or wheel starts to leave the ground before the  downslope skid or wheel, smoothly and gently lower  the collective and check to see if the downslope skid or  wheel is caught on something. Under these conditions,  vertical ascent is the only acceptable method of lift-off.  

12. 	Be aware that dynamic rollover can be experienced  during flight operations on a floating platform if the  platform is pitching/rolling while attempting to land  or takeoff. Generally, the pilot operating on floating  platforms (barges, ships, etc.) observes a cycle of seven  during which the waves increase and then decrease to  a minimum. It is that time of minimum wave motion  that the pilot needs to use for the moment of landing  or takeoff on floating platforms. Pilots operating from  floating platforms should also exercise great caution  concerning cranes, masts, nearby boats (tugs) and nets.  

# Low-G Conditions and Mast Bumping  

“G” is an abbreviation for acceleration due to the earth’s  gravity. A person standing on the ground or sitting in an  aircraft in level flight is experiencing one G. An aircraft in a  tight, banked turn with the pilot being pressed into the seat  is experiencing more than one G or high-G conditions. A  person beginning a downward ride in an elevator or riding  down a steep track on a roller coaster is experiencing less  than one G or low-G conditions. The best way for a pilot to  recognize low G is a weightless feeling similar to the start  of a downward elevator ride.  

Helicopters rely on positive G to provide much or all of their  response to pilot control inputs. The pilot uses the cyclic  to tilt the rotor disk, and, at one G, the rotor is producing  thrust equal to aircraft weight. The tilting of the thrust  vector provides a moment about the center of gravity to  pitch or roll the fuselage. In a low-G condition, the thrust  and consequently the control authority are greatly reduced.  

Although their control ability is reduced, multi-bladed (three  or more blades) helicopters can generate some moment  about the fuselage independent of thrust due to the rotor  hub design with the blade attachment offset from the center  of rotation. However, helicopters with two-bladed teetering  rotors rely entirely on the tilt of the thrust vector for control.  Therefore, low-G conditions can be catastrophic for two- bladed helicopters.  

At lower speeds, such as initiation of a takeoff from hover  or the traditional recovery from vortex ring state, forward  cyclic maneuvers do not cause low G and are safe to perform.  However, an abrupt forward cyclic input or pushover in  a two-bladed helicopter can be dangerous and must be  avoided, particularly at higher speeds. During a pushover  from moderate or high airspeed, as the helicopter noses over,  it enters a low-G condition. Thrust is reduced, and the pilot  has lost control of fuselage attitude but may not immediately  realize it. Tail rotor thrust or other aerodynamic factors will  often induce a roll. The pilot still has control of the rotor disk,  and may instinctively try to correct the roll, but the fuselage  does not respond due to the lack of thrust. If the fuselage is  rolling right, and the pilot puts in left cyclic to correct, the  combination of fuselage angle to the right and rotor disk  angle to the left becomes quite large and may exceed the  clearances built into the rotor hub. This results in the hub  contacting the rotor mast, which is known as mast bumping.  [Figure 11-8]  Low-G mast bumping has been the cause of  numerous military and civilian fatal accidents. It was initially  encountered during nap-of-the-earth flying, a very low- altitude tactical flight technique used by the military where  

![](images/b4a5ccd069cf4d2923e528e08a0898d0b05fede372b325a6cfff11a2adf0e018.jpg)

the aircraft flies following the contours of the geographical  terrain. The accident sequence may be extremely rapid, and  the energy and inertia in the rotor system can sever the mast  or allow rotor blades to strike the tail or other portions of  the helicopter.  

Turbulence, especially severe downdrafts, can also cause a  low-G condition and, when combined with high airspeed,  may lead to mast bumping. Typically, helicopters handle  turbulence better than a light airplane due to smaller  surface area of the rotor blades. During flight in turbulence,  momentary excursions in airspeed, altitude, and attitude are  to be expected. Pilots should respond with smooth, gentle  control inputs and avoid overcontrolling. Most importantly,  pilots should slow down, as mast bumping is less likely at  lower airspeeds.  

Pilots can avoid mast bumping accidents as follows:  

•	 Avoid abrupt forward cyclic inputs in two-bladed  helicopters. Airplane pilots may find this a difficult  habit to break because pushing the nose down is an  accepted collision avoidance maneuver in an airplane.  Helicopter pilots would accomplish the same rapid  descent by lowering the collective, and airplane pilots  should train to make this instinctual. •	 Recognize the weightless feeling associated with the  onset of low G and quickly take corrective action  before the situation becomes critical. •	 Recognize that uncommanded right roll for helicopters  with main rotors which rotate counter-clockwise when  viewed from above indicates that loss of control is  imminent, and immediate corrective action must be  taken. •	 Recover from a low-G situation by first gently  applying aft cyclic to restore normal G before  

attempting to correct any roll.  

•	 If turbulence is expected or encountered, reduce power  and use a slower than normal cruise speed. Turbulence  (where high rotor flapping angles are already present),  and higher airspeeds (where the controls are more  sensitive) both increase susceptibility to low-G  conditions.  •	 Use a flight simulator to learn to recognize and  experience low G conditions that result in mast  bumping, its correct recovery technique, and the  consequences of using incorrect recovery actions.  Refer to Chapter 14, Simulation.  

Multi-bladed rotors may experience a phenomenon similar  to mast bumping known as droop stop pounding if flapping  clearances are exceeded, but because they retain some control  authority at low G, occurrences are less common than for  teetering rotors.  

# Low Rotor RPM and Rotor Stall  

Rotor rpm is a critically important parameter for all helicopter  operations. Just as airplanes will not fly below a certain  airspeed, helicopters will not fly below a certain rotor  rpm. Safe rotor rpm ranges are marked on the helicopter’s  tachometer and specified in the RFM. If the pilot allows the  rotor rpm to fall below the safe operating range, the helicopter  is in a low rpm situation. If the rotor rpm continues to fall,  the rotor will eventually stall.  

Rotor stall should not be confused with retreating blade stall,  which occurs at high forward speeds and over a small portion  of the retreating blade tip. Retreating blade stall causes  vibration and control problems, but the rotor is still very  capable of providing sufficient lift to support the weight of  the helicopter. Rotor stall, however, can occur at any airspeed,  and the rotor quickly stops producing enough lift to support  the helicopter, causing it to lose lift and descend rapidly.  

Rotor stall is very similar to the stall of an airplane wing  at low airspeeds. The airplane wing relies on airspeed to  produce the required airflow over the wing, whereas the  helicopter relies on rotor rpm. As the airspeed of the airplane  decreases or the speed of the helicopter rotor slows down, the  AOA of the wing/rotor blade must be increased to support  the weight of the aircraft. At a critical angle (about   $15^{\circ}.$  ),  the airflow over the wing or the rotor blade will separate  and stall, causing a sudden loss of lift and increase in drag  (refer to Chapter 2, Aerodynamics of Flight). An airplane  pilot recovers from a stall by lowering the nose to reduce the  AOA and adding power to restore normal airflow over the  wing. However, the falling helicopter is experiencing upward  airflow through the rotor disk, and the resulting AOA is so  high that even full down collective will not restore normal  airflow. In the helicopter when the rotor stalls, it does not do  so symmetrically because any forward airspeed will produce  a higher airflow on the advancing side than on the retreating  side. This causes the retreating blade to stall first, and its  weight makes it descend as it moves aft while the advancing  blade is climbing as it goes forward. The resulting low aft  blade and high forward blade become a rapid aft tilting of  the rotor disc sometimes referred to as rotor “blow back” or  “flap back.” As the helicopter begins to descend, the upward  flow of air acting on the bottom surfaces of the tail boom  and any horizontal stabilizers tend to pitch the aircraft nose  down. These two effects, combined with any aft cyclic by  the pilot attempting to keep the aircraft level, allow the rotor  blades to blow back and contact the tail boom, in some cases  actually severing the tail boom. Since the tail rotor is geared  to the main rotor, in many helicopters the loss of main rotor  rpm also causes a significant loss of tail rotor thrust and a  corresponding loss of directional control.  

Rotor stalls in helicopters are not recoverable. At low altitude,  rotor stall will result in an accident with significant damage  to the helicopter, and at altitudes above approximately 50  feet the accident will likely be fatal. Consequently, early  recognition of the low rotor rpm condition and proper  recovery technique is imperative.  

Low rotor rpm can occur during power-off and power-on  operations. During power-off flight, a low rpm situation  can be caused by the failure to quickly lower the collective  after an engine failure or by raising the collective at too  great a height above ground at the bottom of an autorotation.  However, more common are power-on rotor stall accidents.  These occur when the engine is operating normally but the  pilot demands more power than is available by pulling up  too much on the collective. Known as “overpitching,” this  can easily occur at higher density altitudes where the engine  is already producing its maximum horsepower and the pilot  raises the collective. The corresponding increased AOA of  the blades requires more engine horsepower to maintain the  speed of the blades; however, the engine cannot produce any  additional horsepower, so the speed of the blades decreases.  A similar situation can occur with a heavily loaded helicopter  taking off from a confined area. Other causes of a power-on  low rotor rpm condition include the pilot rolling the throttle  the wrong way in helicopters not equipped with a governor  or a governor failure in helicopters so equipped.  

As the rpm decreases, the amount of horsepower the engine  can produce also decreases. Engine horsepower is directly  proportional to its rpm, so a 10 percent loss in rpm due  to overpitching, or one of the other scenarios above, will  result in a 10 percent loss in the engine’s ability to produce  horsepower, making recovery even slower and more difficult  than it would otherwise be. With less power from the engine  and less lift from the decaying rotor rpm, the helicopter will  start to settle. If the pilot raises the collective to stop the  settling, the situation will feed upon itself rapidly leading  to rotor stall.  

There are a number of ways the pilot can recognize the low  rotor rpm situation. Visually, the pilot can not only see the  rotor rpm indicator decrease but also the change in torque  will produce a yaw; there will also be a noticeable decrease in  engine noise, and at higher airspeeds or in turns, an increase in  vibration. Many helicopters have a low rpm warning system  that alerts the pilot to the low rotor rpm condition.  

To recover from the low rotor rpm condition the pilot must  simultaneously lower the collective, increase throttle if  available and apply aft cyclic to maintain a level attitude.  At higher airspeeds, additional aft cyclic may be used to  help recover lost rpm. Recovery should be accomplished  immediately before investigating the problem and must be  practiced to become a conditioned reflex.  

# System Malfunctions  

By following the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding  operating limits and procedures and periodic maintenance  and inspections, many system and equipment failures can  be eliminated. Certain malfunctions or failures can be traced  to some error on the part of the pilot; therefore, appropriate  flying techniques and use of threat and error management  may help to prevent an emergency  

# Antitorque System Failure  

Antitorque failure usually falls into one of two categories.  One is failure of the power drive portion of the tail rotor disk  resulting in a complete loss of antitorque. The other category  covers mechanical control failures prohibiting the pilot from  changing or controlling tail rotor thrust even though the tail  rotor may still be providing antitorque thrust.  

Tail rotor drive system failures include driveshaft failures,  tail rotor gearbox failures, or a complete loss of the tail rotor  itself. In any of these cases, the loss of antitorque normally  results in an immediate spinning of the helicopter’s nose. The  helicopter spins to the right in a counterclockwise rotor disk  and to the left in a clockwise system. This discussion is for a  helicopter with a counterclockwise rotor disk. The severity of  the spin is proportionate to the amount of power being used  and the airspeed. An antitorque failure with a high-power  setting at a low airspeed results in a severe spinning to the  right. At low power settings and high airspeeds, the spin is  less severe. High airspeeds tend to streamline the helicopter  and keep it from spinning.  

If a tail rotor failure occurs, power must be reduced in order to  reduce main rotor torque. The techniques differ depending on  whether the helicopter is in flight or in a hover, but ultimately  require an autorotation. If a complete tail rotor failure occurs  while hovering, enter a hovering autorotation by rolling off  the throttle. If the failure occurs in forward flight, enter a  normal autorotation by lowering the collective and rolling  off the throttle. If the helicopter has enough forward airspeed  (close to cruising speed) when the failure occurs, and  depending on the helicopter design, the vertical stabilizer  may provide enough directional control to allow the pilot to  maneuver the helicopter to a more desirable landing sight.  Applying slight cyclic control opposite the direction of yaw  compensates for some of the yaw. This helps in directional  control, but also increases drag. Care must be taken not to  lose too much forward airspeed because the streamlining  effect diminishes as airspeed is reduced. Also, more altitude is  required to accelerate to the correct airspeed if an autorotation  is entered at a low airspeed.  

The throttle or power lever on some helicopters is not located  on the collective and readily available. Faced with the loss  of antitorque, the pilot of these models may need to achieve  forward flight and let the vertical fin stop the yawing rotation.  With speed and altitude, the pilot will have the time to set  up for an autorotative approach and set the power control  to idle or off as the situation dictates. At low altitudes, the  pilot may not be able to reduce the power setting and enter  the autorotation before impact.  

A mechanical control failure limits or prevents control of tail  rotor thrust and is usually caused by a stuck or broken control  rod or cable. While the tail rotor is still producing antitorque  thrust, it cannot be controlled by the pilot. The amount of  antitorque depends on the position at which the controls jam or  fail. Once again, the techniques differ depending on the amount  of tail rotor thrust, but an autorotation is generally not required.  

The specific manufacturer’s procedures should always be  followed. The following is a generalized description of  procedures when more specific procedures are not provided.  

# Landing—Stuck Left Pedal  

A stuck left pedal (high power setting), which might be  experienced during takeoff or climb conditions, results in  the left yaw of the helicopter nose when power is reduced.  Rolling off the throttle and entering an autorotation only  makes matters worse. The landing profile for a stuck left  pedal is best described as a normal-to-steep approach angle to  arrive approximately 2–3 feet landing gear height above the  intended landing area as translational lift is lost. The steeper  angle allows for a lower power setting during the approach  and ensures that the nose remains to the right.  

Upon reaching the intended touchdown area and at the  appropriate landing gear height, increase the collective  smoothly to align the nose with the landing direction and  cushion the landing. A small amount of forward cyclic is  helpful to stop the nose from continuing to the right and  directs the aircraft forward and down to the surface. In certain  wind conditions, the nose of the helicopter may remain  to the left with zero to near zero groundspeed above the  intended touchdown point. If the helicopter is not turning,  simply lower the helicopter to the surface. If the nose of the  helicopter is turning to the right and continues beyond the  landing heading, roll the throttle toward flight idle, which is  the amount necessary to stop the turn while landing. Flight  idle is an engine rpm in flight at a given altitude with the  throttle set to the minimum, or idle, position. The flight  idling rpm typically increase with an increase in altitude.  If the helicopter is beginning to turn left, the pilot should  be able to make the landing prior to the turn rate becoming  excessive. However, if the turn rate begins to increase prior  to the landing, simply add power to make a go-around and  return for another landing.  

# Landing—Stuck Neutral or Right Pedal  

The landing profile for a stuck neutral or a stuck right pedal  is a low-power approach terminating with a running or roll- on landing. The approach profile can best be described as a  shallow to normal approach angle to arrive approximately  2–3 feet landing gear height above the intended landing  area with a minimum airspeed for directional control. The  minimum airspeed is one that keeps the nose from continuing  to yaw to the right.  

Upon reaching the intended touchdown area and at the  appropriate landing gear height, reduce the throttle as  necessary to overcome the yaw effect if the nose of the  helicopter remains to the right of the landing heading. The  amount of throttle reduction will vary based on power applied  and winds. The higher the power setting used to cushion the  landing, the more the throttle reduction will be. A coordinated  throttle reduction and increased collective will result in a very  smooth touchdown with some forward groundspeed. If the  nose of the helicopter is to the left of the landing heading,  a slight increase in collective or aft cyclic may be used to  align the nose for touchdown. The decision to land or go  around has to be made prior to any throttle reduction. Using  airspeeds slightly above translational lift may be helpful to  ensure that the nose does not continue yawing to the right. If  a go-around is required, increasing the collective too much or  too rapidly with airspeeds below translational lift may cause  a rapid spinning to the right.  

Once the helicopter has landed and is sliding/rolling to a  stop, the heading can be controlled with a combination of  collective, cyclic and throttle. To turn the nose to the right,  raise the collective or apply aft cyclic. The throttle may be  increased as well if it is not in the full open position. To turn  the nose to the left, lower the collective or apply forward  cyclic. The throttle may be decreased as well if it is not  already at flight idle.  

# Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE)  

Loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) or an unanticipated  yaw is defined as an uncommanded, rapid yaw towards the  advancing blade which does not subside of its own accord.  It can result in the loss of the aircraft if left unchecked. It is  very important for pilots to understand that LTE is caused  by an aerodynamic interaction between the main rotor and  tail rotor and not caused from a mechanical failure. Some  helicopter types are more likely to encounter LTE due to the  normal certification thrust produced by having a tail rotor  that, although meeting certification standards, is not always  able to produce the additional thrust demanded by the pilot.  

A helicopter is a collection of compromises. Compare the  size of an airplane propeller to that of a tail rotor. Then,  consider the horsepower required to run the propeller. For  example, a Cessna 172P is equipped with a 160-horsepower  (HP) engine. A Robinson R-44 with a comparably sized tail  rotor is rated for a maximum of   $245\;\mathrm{HP}$  . If you assume the  tail rotor consumes   $50~\mathrm{HP}$  , only   $195~\mathrm{HP}$   remains to drive  the main rotor. If the pilot were to apply enough collective  to require  $215\;\mathrm{HP}$   from the engine, and enough left pedal to  require  $50\,\mathrm{HP}$   for the tail rotor, the resulting engine overload  would lead to one of two outcomes: slow down (reduction  in rpm) or premature failure. In either outcome, antitorque  would be insufficient and total lift might be less than needed  to remain airborne.  

Every helicopter design requires some type of antitorque  system to counteract main rotor torque and prevent spinning  once the helicopter lifts off the ground. A helicopter is heavy,  and the powerplant places a high demand on fuel. Weight  penalizes performance, but all helicopters must have an  antitorque system, which adds weight. Therefore, the tail  rotor is certified for normal flight conditions. Environmental  forces can overwhelm any aircraft, rendering the inherently  unstable helicopter especially vulnerable.  

As with any aerodynamic condition, it is very important for  pilots to not only to understand the definition of LTE, but  more importantly, how and why it happens, how to avoid  it, and lastly, how to correct it once it is encountered. We  must first understand the capabilities of the aircraft or even  better what it is not capable of doing. For example, if you  were flying a helicopter with a maximum gross weight of  5,200 lb, would you knowingly try to take on fuel, baggage  and passengers causing the weight to be 5,500 lb? A wise  professional pilot should not ever exceed the certificated  maximum gross weight or performance flight weight for any  aircraft. The manuals are written for safety and reliability.  The limitations and emergency procedures are stressed  because lapses in procedures or exceeding limitations can  result in aircraft damage or human fatalities. At the very least,  exceeding limitations will increase the costs of maintenance  and ownership of any aircraft and especially helicopters.  

Overloaded parts may fail before their designed lifetime. There  are no extra parts in helicopters. The respect and discipline  pilots exercise in following flight manuals should also be  applied to understanding aerodynamic conditions. If flight  envelopes are exceeded, the end results can be catastrophic.  

LTE is an aerodynamic condition and is the result of a control  margin deficiency in the tail rotor. It can affect all single-rotor  helicopters that utilize a tail rotor. The design of main and  tail rotor blades and the tail boom assembly can affect the  characteristics and susceptibility of LTE but will not nullify  the phenomenon entirely. Translational lift is obtained by  any amount of clean air through the main rotor disk. Chapter  2, Aerodynamics of Flight, discusses translational lift with  respect to the main rotor blade, explaining that the more  clean air there is going through the rotor disk, the more  efficient it becomes. The same holds true for the tail rotor.  As the tail rotor works in less turbulent air, it reaches a point  of translational thrust. At this point, the tail rotor becomes  aerodynamically efficient and the improved efficiency  produces more antitorque thrust. The pilot can determine  when the tail rotor has reached translational thrust. As more  antitorque thrust is produced, the nose of the helicopter  yaws to the left (opposite direction of the tail rotor thrust),  forcing the pilot to correct with right pedal application  (actually decreasing the left pedal). This, in turn, decreases  the AOA in the tail rotor blades. Pilots should be aware of the  characteristics of the helicopter they fly and be particularly  aware of the amount of tail rotor pedal typically required for  different flight conditions.  

LTE is a condition that occurs when the flow of air through  a tail rotor is altered in some way, by altering the angle or  speed at which the air passes through the rotating blades of  the tail rotor disk. As discussed in the previous paragraph, an  effective tail rotor relies on a stable and relatively undisturbed  airflow in order to provide a steady and constant antitorque  reaction. The pitch and AOA of the individual blades will  determine the thrust. A change to either of these alters the  amount of thrust generated. A pilot’s yaw pedal input causes  a thrust reaction from the tail rotor. Altering the amount of  thrust delivered for the same yaw input creates an imbalance.  Taking this imbalance to the extreme will result in the loss  of effective control in the yawing plane, and LTE will occur.  

This alteration of tail rotor thrust can be affected by numerous  external factors. The main factors contributing to LTE are:  

1.	 Airflow and downdraft generated by the main rotor  blades interfering with the airflow entering the tail  rotor assembly. 2.	 Main blade vortices developed at the main blade tips  entering the tail rotor disk. 3.	 Turbulence and other natural phenomena affecting the  airflow surrounding the tail rotor.  4.	 A high-power setting, hence large main rotor  pitch angle, induces considerable main rotor blade  downwash and hence more turbulence than when the  helicopter is in a low power condition. 5.	 A slow forward airspeed, typically at speeds where  translational lift and translational thrust are in the  process of change and airflow around the tail rotor  will vary in direction and speed.  

6.	 The airflow relative to the helicopter;  

a.	 Worst case—relative wind within   $\pm15^{\circ}$   of the  10 o’clock position, generating vortices that  can blow directly into the tail rotor. This is  dictated by the characteristics of the helicopters  aerodynamics of tailboom position, tail rotor size  and position relative to the main rotor and vertical  stabilizer, size and shape.  [Figure 11-9]  b.	 Weathercock stability—tailwinds from   $120^{\circ}$   to   $240^{\circ}$    [Figure 11-10] , such as left crosswinds,  causing high pilot workload. c.	 Tail rotor vortex ring state (  $210^{\circ}$   to   $330^{\circ}$  ).  [Figure 11-11]  Winds within this region  will result in the development of the vortex ring  state of the tail rotor. Combinations (a, b, c) of these factors in a particular  

situation can easily require more antitorque than the  helicopter can generate and in a particular environment  LTE can be the result.  

Certain flight activities lend themselves to being at higher  risk of LTE than others. For example, power line and pipeline  patrol sectors, low speed aerial filming/photography as well  as in the Police and Helicopter Emergency Medical Services

(EMS) environments can find themselves in low-and-slow  situations over geographical areas where the exact wind speed  and direction are hard to determine.

Figure 11-11.  Tail rotor vortex ring state.  

Unfortunately, the aerodynamic conditions that a helicopter  is susceptible to are not explainable in black and white terms.  LTE is no exception. There are a number of contributing  factors, but what is more important in preventing LTE is to  note them, and then to associate them with situations that  should be avoided. Whenever possible, pilots should learn  to avoid the following combinations:  

1.	 Low and slow flight outside of ground effect. 2.	 Winds from   $\pm15^{\circ}$   of the 10 o’clock position and  probably on around to 5 o’clock position  [Figure 11-9] 3.	 Tailwinds that may alter the onset of translational lift  and translational thrust, and hence induce high power  demands and demand more anti-torque (left pedal)  than the tail rotor can produce.  4.	 Low speed downwind turns. 5.	 Large changes of power at low airspeeds. 6.	 Low speed flight in the proximity of physical  obstructions that may alter a smooth airflow to both  the main rotor and tail rotor.  

Pilots who put themselves in situations where the combinations  above occur should know that they are likely to encounter  LTE. The key is not to put the helicopter in a compromising  condition, while at the same time being educated enough  to recognize the onset of LTE and being prepared to react  quickly to it before the helicopter cannot be controlled.  

Early detection of LTE, followed by the immediate flight  control application of corrective action, applying forward  cyclic to regain airspeed, applying right pedal not left as  necessary to maintain rotor rpm, and reducing the collective  (thus reducing the high-power demand on the tail rotor), is the  key to a safe recovery. Pilots should always set themselves  up when conducting any maneuver to have enough height  and space available to recover in the event they encounter  an aerodynamic situation such as LTE.  

Understanding the aerodynamic phenomenon of LTE is by  far the most important factor in preventing an LTE-related  accident, and maintaining the ability and option either to go  around if making an approach or pull out of a maneuver safely  and re-plan, is always the safest option. Having the ability to  fly away from a situation and re-think the possible options  should always be part of a pilot's planning process in all phases  of flight. Unfortunately, there have been many pilots who  have idled a good engine and fully functioning tail rotor disk  and autorotated a perfectly airworthy helicopter to the crash  site because they misunderstood or misperceived both the  limitations of the helicopter and the aerodynamic situation.  

# Main Rotor Disk Interference (285–315°)  

Refer to  Figure 11-9.  Winds at velocities of 10–30 knots from  the left front cause the main rotor vortex to be blown into the  tail rotor by the relative wind. This main rotor disk vortex  causes the tail rotor to operate in an extremely turbulent  environment. During a right turn, the tail rotor experiences a  reduction of thrust as it comes into the area of the main rotor  disk vortex. The reduction in tail rotor thrust comes from the  airflow changes experienced at the tail rotor as the main rotor  disk vortex moves across the tail rotor disk.  

The effect of the main rotor disk vortex initially increases the  AOA of the tail rotor blades, thus increasing tail rotor thrust.  The increase in the AOA requires that right pedal pressure  be added to reduce tail rotor thrust in order to maintain the  same rate of turn. As the main rotor vortex passes the tail  rotor, the tail rotor AOA is reduced. The reduction in the  AOA causes a reduction in thrust and right yaw acceleration  begins. This acceleration can be surprising, since previously  adding right pedal to maintain the right turn rate. This thrust  reduction occurs suddenly, and if uncorrected, develops  into an uncontrollable rapid rotation about the mast. When  operating within this region, be aware that the reduction in  tail rotor thrust can happen quite suddenly, and be prepared  to react quickly to counter this reduction with additional left  pedal input.  

# Weathercock Stability (120–240°)  

In this region, the helicopter attempts to weathervane,  or weathercock, its nose into the relative wind.  [Figure 11-10]  Unless a resisting pedal input is made, the  helicopter starts a slow, uncommanded turn either to the right  or left, depending upon the wind direction. If the pilot allows  a right yaw rate to develop and the tail of the helicopter moves  into this region, the yaw rate can accelerate rapidly. In order  to avoid the onset of LTE in this downwind condition, it is  imperative to maintain positive control of the yaw rate and  devote full attention to flying the helicopter.  

# Tail Rotor Vortex Ring State (210–330°)  

Winds within this region cause a tail rotor vortex ring state to  develop.  [Figure 11-11]  The result is a nonuniform, unsteady  flow into the tail rotor. The vortex ring state causes tail  rotor thrust variations, which result in yaw deviations. The  net effect of the unsteady flow is an oscillation of tail rotor  thrust. Rapid and continuous pedal movements are necessary  to compensate for the rapid changes in tail rotor thrust when  hovering in a left crosswind. Maintaining a precise heading  in this region is difficult, but this characteristic presents  no significant problem unless corrective action is delayed.  However, high pedal workload, lack of concentration, and  overcontrolling can lead to LTE.  

When the tail rotor thrust being generated is less than the  thrust required, the helicopter yaws to the right. When  hovering in left crosswinds, concentrate on smooth pedal  coordination and do not allow an uncommanded right yaw to  develop. If a right yaw rate is allowed to build, the helicopter  can rotate into the wind azimuth region where weathercock  stability then accelerates the right turn rate. Pilot workload  during a tail rotor vortex ring state is high. Do not allow a  right yaw rate to increase.  

# LTE at Altitude  

At higher altitudes where the air is thinner, tail rotor thrust  and efficiency are reduced. Because of the high-density  altitude, powerplants may be much slower to respond to  power changes. When operating at high altitudes and high  gross weights, especially while hovering, the tail rotor thrust  may not be sufficient to maintain directional control, and  LTE can occur. In this case, the hovering ceiling is limited  by tail rotor thrust and not necessarily power available. In  these conditions, gross weights need to be reduced and/ or operations need to be limited to lower density altitudes.  This may not be noted as criteria on the performance charts.  

# Reducing the Onset of LTE  

To help reduce the onset of LTE, follow these steps:  

1.	 Maintain maximum power-on rotor rpm. If the main  rotor rpm is allowed to decrease, the antitorque thrust  available is decreased proportionally. 2.	 Avoid tailwinds below airspeeds of 30 knots. If loss  of translational lift occurs, it results in an increased  

power demand and additional antitorque pressures. 3.	 Avoid OGE operations and high-power demand  situations below airspeeds of 30 knots at low altitudes. 4.	 Be especially aware of wind direction and velocity  when hovering in winds of about 8–12 knots. A loss  of translational lift results in an unexpected high power  demand and an increased antitorque requirement. 5.	 Be aware that if a considerable amount of left pedal  is being maintained, a sufficient amount of left pedal  may not be available to counteract an unanticipated  right yaw. 6.	 Be alert to changing wind conditions, which may be  experienced when flying along ridge lines and around  buildings. 7. 	 Execute right turns slowly. This limits the effects of  rotating inertia, and decreases loading on the tailrotor  to control yawing.  

# Recovery Technique (Uncontrolled Right Yaw)  

If a sudden unanticipated right yaw occurs, the following  recovery technique should be performed. Apply full left  pedal. Simultaneously, apply forward cyclic control to  increase speed. If altitude permits, reduce power. As recovery  is affected, adjust controls for normal forward flight. A  recovery path must always be planned, especially when  terminating to an OGE hover and executed immediately if  an uncommanded yaw is evident.  

Collective pitch reduction aids in arresting the yaw rate but  may cause an excessive rate of descent. Any large, rapid  increase in collective to prevent ground or obstacle contact  may further increase the yaw rate and decrease rotor rpm.  The decision to reduce collective must be based on the pilot’s  assessment of the altitude available for recovery.  

If the rotation cannot be stopped and ground contact is  imminent, an autorotation may be the best course of action.  Maintain full left pedal until the rotation stops, then adjust to  maintain heading. For more information on LTE, see Advisory  Circular (AC) 90-95, Unanticipated Right Yaw in Helicopters.  

# Main Drive Shaft or Clutch Failure  

The main drive shaft, located between the engine and the main  rotor transmission, provides engine power to the main rotor  transmission. In some helicopters, particularly those with  piston engines, a drive belt is used instead of a drive shaft.  A failure of the drive shaft clutch or belt has the same effect  as an engine failure because power is no longer provided to  the main rotor and an autorotation must be initiated. There  are a few differences, however, that need to be taken into  consideration. If the drive shaft or belt breaks, the lack of any  load on the engine results in an overspeed. In this case, the  throttle must be closed in order to prevent any further damage.  In some helicopters, the tail rotor drive system continues to  be powered by the engine even if the main drive shaft breaks.  In this case, when the engine unloads, a tail rotor overspeed  can result. If this happens, close the throttle immediately and  enter an autorotation. The pilot must be knowledgeable of the  specific helicopter’s system and failure modes.  

Pilots should keep in mind that when there is any suspected  mechanical malfunction, first and foremost they should  always attempt to maintain rotor rpm. If the rotor rpm is at the  normal indication with normal power settings, an instrument  failure might be occurring, and it would be best to fly the  helicopter to a safe landing area. If the rotor rpm is in fact  decreasing or low, then there is a drive line failure.  

# Hydraulic Failure  

Many helicopters incorporate the use of hydraulic actuators to  overcome high control forces. A hydraulic system consists of  actuators, also called servos, on each flight control; a pump,  which is usually driven by the main rotor transmission;  and a reservoir to store the hydraulic fluid. A switch in the  cockpit can turn the system off, although it is left on during  normal conditions. A pressure indicator in the cockpit may  be installed to monitor the system.  

An impending hydraulic failure can be recognized by a  grinding or howling noise from the pump or actuators,  increased control forces and feedback, and limited control  movement. The required corrective action is stated in detail  in the RFM. In most cases, airspeed needs to be reduced in  order to reduce control forces. The hydraulic switch and  circuit breaker should be checked and recycled. If hydraulic  power is not restored, make a shallow approach to a running  or roll-on landing. This technique is used because it requires  less control force and pilot workload. Additionally, the  hydraulic system should be disabled by placing the switch  in the off position. The reason for this is to prevent an  inadvertent restoration of hydraulic power, which may lead  to overcontrolling near the ground.  

In those helicopters in which the control forces are so high  that they cannot be moved without hydraulic assistance, two  or more independent hydraulic systems are installed. Some  helicopters use hydraulic accumulators to store pressure that  can be used for a short time while in an emergency if the  hydraulic pump fails. This gives enough time to land the  helicopter with normal control.  

# Governor or Fuel Control Failure  

Governors and fuel control units automatically adjust engine  power to maintain rotor rpm when the collective pitch  is changed. If the governor or fuel control unit fails, any  change in collective pitch requires manual adjustment of  the throttle to maintain correct rpm. In the event of a high  side failure, the engine and rotor rpm tend to increase above  the normal range due to the engine being commanded to  put out too much power. If the rpm cannot be reduced and  controlled with the throttle, close the throttle and enter an  autorotation. If the failure is on the low side, the engine  output is allowed to go below the collective and normal  rpm may not be attainable, even if the throttle is manually  controlled. In this case, the collective has to be lowered to  maintain rotor rpm. A running or roll-on landing may be  performed if the engine can maintain sufficient rotor rpm. If  there is insufficient power, enter an autorotation. As stated  previously in this chapter, before responding to any type of  mechanical failure, pilots should confirm that rotor rpm is  not responding to flight control inputs. If the rotor rpm can  be maintained in the green operating range, the failure is in  the instrument, and not mechanical.  

# Abnormal Vibration  

With the many rotating parts found in helicopters, some  vibration is inherent. A pilot needs to understand the  cause and effect of helicopter vibrations because abnormal  vibrations cause premature component wear and may even  result in structural failure. With experience, a pilot learns  what vibrations are normal and those that are abnormal  and can then decide whether continued flight is safe or not.  Helicopter vibrations are categorized into low, medium, or  high frequency.  

# Low-Frequency Vibrations  

Low-frequency vibrations (100–500 cycles per minute) usually  originate from the main rotor disk. The main rotor operational  range, depending on the helicopter, is usually between 320  and  $500\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . A rotor blade that is out of track or balance will  cause a cycle to occur with every rotation. The vibration may  be felt through the controls, the airframe, or a combination  of both. The vibration may also have a definite direction  of push or thrust. It may be vertical, lateral, horizontal, or  even a combination of these. Normally, the direction of the  vibration can be determined by concentrating on the feel of  the vibration, which may push a pilot up and down, backwards  and forwards, or in the case of a blade being out of phase, from  side to side. The direction of the vibration and whether it is  felt in the controls or the airframe is important information for  the mechanic when he or she troubleshoots the source. Out- of-track or out-of-balance main rotor blades, damaged blades,  worn bearings, dampers out of adjustment, or worn parts are  possible causes of low frequency vibrations.  

# Medium- and High-Frequency Vibrations  

Medium-frequency vibrations (1,000–2,000 cycles per  minute) range between the low frequencies of the main rotor  (100–500 cycles per minute) and the high frequencies (2,100  cycles per minute or higher) of the engine and tail rotor.  Depending on the helicopter, medium-frequency vibration  sources may be engine and transmission cooling fans, and  accessories such as air conditioner compressors, or driveline  components. Medium-frequency vibrations are felt through  the entire airframe, and prolonged exposure to the vibrations  will result in greater pilot fatigue.  

Most tail rotor vibrations fall into the high-frequency range 

 (2,100 cycles per minute or higher) and can be felt through  the tail rotor pedals as long as there are no hydraulic actuators  to dampen out the vibration. This vibration is felt by the pilot  through his or her feet, which are usually “put to sleep” by  the vibration. The tail rotor operates at approximately a 6:1  ratio with the main rotor, meaning for every one rotation  of the main rotor the tail rotor rotates 6 times. A main  rotor operating rpm of 350 means the tail rotor rpm would  be   $2{,}100\ \mathrm{rpm}$  . Any imbalance in the tail rotor disk is very  harmful as it can cause cracks to develop and rivets to work  loose. Piston engines usually produce a normal amount of  high-frequency vibration, which is aggravated by engine  malfunctions, such as spark plug fouling, incorrect magneto  timing, carburetor icing and/or incorrect fuel/air mixture.  Vibrations in turbine engines are often difficult to detect as  these engines operate at a very high rpm. Turbine engine  vibration can be at   $30{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$   internally, but common  transmission speeds are in the 1,000 to  $3{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$   range for  the output shaft. The vibrations in turbine engines may be  short lived as the engine disintegrates rapidly when damaged  due to high rpm and the forces present.  

# Tracking and Balance  

Modern equipment used for tracking and balancing the main  and tail rotor blades can also be used to detect other vibrations  in the helicopter. These systems use accelerometers mounted  around the helicopter to detect the direction, frequency, and  intensity of the vibration. The built-in software can then  analyze the information, pinpoint the origin of the vibration,  and suggest the corrective action.  

The use of a system such as a health and usage monitoring  system (HUMS) provides the operator the ability to record  engine and transmission performance and provide rotor track  and balance. This system has been around for over 30 years  and is now becoming more affordable, more capable, and  more commonplace in the rotorcraft industry.  

# Multiengine Emergency Operations  

# Single-Engine Failure  

When one engine has failed, the helicopter can often maintain  altitude and airspeed until a suitable landing site can be  selected. Whether or not this is possible becomes a function  of such combined variables as aircraft weight, density  altitude, height above ground, airspeed, phase of flight,  and single-engine capability. Environmental response time  and control technique may be additional factors. Caution  must be exercised to correctly identify the malfunctioning  engine since there is no telltale yawing as occurs in most  multiengine airplanes. Shutting down the wrong engine  could be disastrous!  

Even when flying multiengine powered helicopters, rotor rpm  must be maintained at all costs, because fuel contamination has  been documented as the cause for both engines failing in flight.  

# Dual-Engine Failure  

The flight characteristics and the required crew member  control responses after a dual-engine failure are similar to  those during a normal power-on descent. Full control of the  helicopter can be maintained during autorotational descent.  In autorotation, as airspeed increases above 70–80 KIAS, the  rate of descent and glide distance increase significantly. As  airspeed decreases below approximately 60 KIAS, the rate  of descent increases and glide distance decreases.  

# Lost Procedures  

Pilots become lost while flying for a variety of reasons, such  as disorientation, flying over unfamiliar territory, or visibility  that is low enough to render familiar terrain unfamiliar. When  a pilot becomes lost, the first order of business is to fly the  aircraft; the second is to implement lost procedures. Keep  in mind that the pilot workload will be high, and increased  concentration will be necessary. If lost, always remember to  look for the practically invisible hazards, such as wires, by  searching for their support structures, such as poles or towers,  which are almost always near roads.  

If lost, follow common sense procedures.  

•	 Try to locate any large landmarks, such as lakes, rivers,  towers, railroad tracks, or Interstate highways. If a  landmark is recognized, use it to find the helicopter’s  location on the sectional chart. If flying near a town or  city, a pilot may be able to read the name of the town  on a water tower or even land to ask for directions. •	 If no town or city is nearby, the first thing a pilot should  do is climb. An increase in altitude increases radio and  navigation reception range as well as radar coverage.  

•	 Navigation aids, dead reckoning, and pilotage are  

•	 Do not forget air traffic control (ATC)—controllers  assist pilots in many ways, including finding a lost  helicopter. Once communication with ATC has been  established, follow their instructions.  

These common-sense procedures can be easily remembered by  using the four Cs: Climb, Communicate, Confess, and Comply.  

•	 Climb for a better view, improved communication and  navigation reception, and terrain avoidance. •	 Communicate by calling the nearest flight service  station (FSS)/automated flight service station (AFSS)  on   $122.2\ \mathrm{MHz}$  . If the FSS/AFSS does not respond,  call the nearest control tower, center, or approach  control. For frequencies, check the chart in the vicinity  of the last known position. If that fails, switch to  the emergency radio frequency   $(121.5~\mathrm{MHz})$  ) and  transponder code (7700). •	 Report the lost situation to ATC and request help. •	 Comply with controller instructions.  

Pilots should understand the services provided by ATC and  the resources and options available. These services enable  pilots to focus on aircraft control and help them make better  decisions in a time of stress.  

When contacting ATC, pilots should provide as much  information as possible because ATC uses the information  to determine what kind of assistance it can provide with  available assets and capabilities. Information requirements  vary depending on the existing situation, but at a minimum  a pilot should provide the following information:  

•	 Aircraft identification and type  •	 Nature of the emergency  •	 Aviator’s desires  

To reduce the chances of getting lost in the first place, use  flight following through active contact with an aircraft during  flight either by radio or through automated flight following  systems when it is available, monitor checkpoints no more  than 25 miles apart, keep navigation aids such as Very  High-Frequency Omni-Directional Range (VOR) tuned in,  and maintain good situational awareness. Flight following  provides ongoing surveillance information to assist pilots in  avoiding collisions with other aircraft.  

Getting lost is a potentially dangerous situation for any  aircraft, especially when low on fuel. Due to the helicopter’s  unique ability to land almost anywhere, pilots have more  flexibility than other aircraft as to landing site. An inherent  risk associated with being lost is waiting too long to land in a  safe area. Helicopter pilots should land before fuel exhaustion  occurs because maneuvering with low fuel levels could cause  the engine to stop due to fuel starvation as fuel sloshes or  flows away from the pickup port in the tank.  

If lost and low on fuel, it is advisable to make a precautionary  landing. Preferably, land near a road or in an area that would  allow space for another helicopter to safely land and provide  assistance. Having fuel delivered is a minor inconvenience  when compared to having an accident. Once on the ground,  pilots may seek assistance.  

# VFR Flight into Instrument Meteorological  Conditions  

Helicopters, unlike airplanes, generally operate under Visual  Flight Rules (VFR) and require pilots to maintain aircraft  control by visual cues. However, when unforecast weather  leads to degraded visibility, the pilot may be at increased  risk of Inadvertent flight into Instrument Meteorological  Conditions (IIMC). During an IIMC encounter, the pilot  may be unprepared for the loss of visual reference, resulting  in a reduced ability to continue safe flight. IIMC is a life- threatening emergency for any pilot. To capture these IIMC  events, the Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) and  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Common  Taxonomy Team (CICTT) categorizes this occurrence as  Unintended flight in Instrument Meteorological Conditions  (UIMC). This term is also recognized by the National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA). It is used to classify occurrences  (accidents and incidents) at a high level to improve the  capacity to focus on common safety issues and complete  analysis of the data in support of safety initiatives.  

The onset of IIMC may occur gradually or suddenly, has  no simple procedural exit, and is unlike flight training by  reference to while in Visual Meteorological Conditions  (VMC). Most training helicopters are not equipped or  certified to fly under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).  Therefore, General Aviation (GA) helicopter pilots may not  have the benefit of flight in actual Instrument Meteorological  Conditions (IMC) during their flight training. Helicopter  pilots that encounter IIMC may experience physiological  illusions which can lead to spatial disorientation and loss of  aircraft control. Even with some instrument training, many  available and accessible helicopters are not equipped with  the proper augmented safety systems or autopilots, which  would significantly aid in helicopter control during an  IIMC emergency. The need to use outside visual references  is natural for helicopter pilots because much of their flight  training is based upon visual cues, not on flight instruments.  This primacy can only be overcome through significant  instrument training. Additionally, instrument flight may be  intimidating to some and too costly for others. As a result,  many helicopter pilots choose not to seek an instrument  rating.  

While commercial helicopter operators often prefer their  pilots to be instrument rated, fatal accidents still occur as  a result of IIMC. Many accidents can be traced back to  the pilot’s inability to recover the helicopter after IIMC  is encountered, even with adequate equipment installed.  Therefore, whether instrument rated or not, all pilots should  understand that avoiding IIMC is critical.  

A good practice for any flight is to set and use personal  minimums, which should be more conservative than those  required by regulations for VFR flight. In addition, a thorough  preflight and understanding of weather conditions that may  contribute to the risk of IMC developing along a planned  route of flight is essential for safety. Pilots should recognize  deteriorating weather conditions so the route of flight can be  changed or a decision made to terminate the flight and safely  land at a suitable area, well before IIMC occurs. If weather  conditions deteriorate below the pilot’s personal minimums  during flight, a pilot who understands the risks of IIMC  knows that he or she is at an en route decision point, where  it is necessary to either turn back to the departure point or  immediately land somewhere safe to wait until the weather  has cleared. Pilots should recognize that descent below a  predetermined minimum altitude above ground level (AGL)  (for example, 500 feet AGL) to avoid clouds or, slowing  the helicopter to a predetermined minimum airspeed (for  example, slowing to 50 KIAS) to reduce the rate of closure  from the deteriorating weather conditions, indicates the  decision point had been reached. Ceilings that are lower than  reported and/or deteriorating visibility along the route of  flight should trigger the decision to discontinue and amend  the current route to avoid IIMC.  

If the helicopter pilot is instrument rated, it is advisable to  maintain instrument currency and proficiency as this may  aid the pilot in a safe recovery from IIMC. A consideration  for instrument rated pilots when planning a VFR flight  should include a review of published instrument charts for  safe operating altitudes, e.g. minimum safe altitude (MSA),  minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), minimum  in VMC throughout a flight: off-route altitude (MORA),  etc. If IIMC occurs, the pilot may consider a climb to a safe  altitude. Once the helicopter is stabilized, the pilot should  declare an emergency with air traffic control (ATC). It is  imperative that the pilot commit to controlling the helicopter  and remember to aviate, navigate, and finally communicate.  Often communication is attempted first, as it is natural to  look for help in stressful situations. This may distract the  pilot from maintaining control of the helicopter.  

If the pilot is not instrument rated, instrument current nor  proficient, or is flying a non-IFR equipped helicopter,  remaining in VMC is paramount. Pilots who are not trained  or proficient in flight solely by reference to instruments have  a tendency to attempt to maintain flight by visual ground  reference, which tends to result in flying at lower altitudes,  just above the trees or by following roads. The thought process  is that, "as long as I can see what is below me, I can continue  to my intended destination." Experience and statistical data  indicate that attempting to continue VFR flight into IMC can  often lead to a fatal outcome as pilots often fixate on what  they see below them and are unable to see the hazards ahead  of them (e.g., power lines, towers, rising terrain, etc.). By  the time the pilot sees the hazard, it is either too late to avoid  a collision, or while successfully maneuvering to avoid an  obstacle, the pilot becomes disoriented.  

Flying at night involves even more conservative personal  minimums to ensure safety and avoidance of IIMC than  daytime flying. At night, deteriorating weather conditions  may be difficult to detect. Therefore, pilots should ensure  that they not only receive a thorough weather briefing, but  that they remain vigilant for unforecasted weather during  their flight. The planned route should include preselected  landing sites that will provide options to the pilot in the  event a precautionary landing is required to avoid adverse  weather conditions. As a pilot gains night flight experience  their ability to assess weather during a flight will improve.  

Below are some basic guidelines to assist a pilot to remain  in VMC throughout a flight:  

1.	 Slowly turn around if threatened by deteriorating  visual cues and proceed back to VMC or to the first  safe landing area if the weather ahead becomes  questionable. Remember that prevention is paramount.  2.	 Do not proceed further on a course when the terrain  ahead is not clearly discernible.  3.	 Delay or consider cancelling the flight if weather  conditions are already questionable, could deteriorate  significantly based on forecasts, or if you are uncertain  whether the flight can be conducted safely. Often, a  gut feeling can provide a warning that unreasonable  risks are present. 4.	 Always have a safe landing area (such as large open  areas or airports) in mind for every route of flight.  

There are five basic steps that every pilot should be familiar  with, and which should be executed immediately at the onset  of IIMC, if applicable. However, remember that if you are  not trained to execute the following maneuvers solely by  reference to instruments, or your aircraft is not equipped  with such instruments, this guidance may be less beneficial  to you and loss of helicopter control may occur:  

1.	 Level the “wings” – level the bank angle using the  attitude indicator. 2.	 Attitude – set a climb attitude that achieves a safe  climb speed appropriate to your type of helicopter.  This is often no more than   $10^{\circ}$   of pitch up on the  attitude indicator.  3.	 Airspeed – verify that the attitude selected has  achieved the desired airspeed. It is critical to 	 recognize that slower airspeeds, closer to effective  translational lift, may require large control inputs and  will decrease stability, making recover impossible  while in UIMC. 4.	 Power – adjust to a climb power setting relative to the  desired airspeed. This should be executed concurrent  with steps 2 and 3.  5.	 Heading and Trim – pick a heading known to be free  of obstacles and maintain it. This will likely be the  heading you were already on, which was planned and  briefed. Set the heading bug, if installed, to avoid over- controlling your bank. Maintain coordinated flight so  that an unusual attitude will not develop.  

Try to avoid immediately turning   $180^{\circ}$  . Turning around is  not always the safest route and executing a turn immediately  after UIMC may lead to spatial disorientation. If a   $180^{\circ}$   turn  is the safest option, first note the heading you are on then  begin the turn to the reciprocal heading, but only after stable  flight is achieved (items 1 through 5 above) and maintain  a constant rate of turn appropriate to the selected airspeed.  

Each encounter with UIMC is unique, and no single  procedure can ensure a safe outcome. Considerations in  determining the best course of action upon encountering  UIMC should include, at a minimum, terrain, obstructions,  freezing levels, aircraft performance and limitations, and  availability of ATC services.  

There are new technologies being developed regarding  aircraft design, enhanced and lower-cost technologies,  and aircraft certification. Because of this promising future,  much of the discussion and guidance in this chapter may  one day become irrelevant. As helicopters integrate more  into the National Airspace System, the IFR infrastructure  and instrument training will become more prevalent. In the  future, UIMC may no longer be the emergency that ends  with a fatality but rather associated with proper prevention,  skilled recovery techniques along with the aid of emerging  new life saving avionics technology. A helicopter instrument  rating may be a life-saving addition to a pilot’s level of  

![](images/3db331ce9aab334ac841b32607abd5677fc2af4b714782a3bad79e0cd6acbc47.jpg)  

certification. Please refer to the Instrument Flying Handbook 

 (FAA-H-8083-15, as revised); Advanced Avionics Handbook 

 (FAA-H-8083-6, as revised); and the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25, as revised) for  further exploration of IFR operations and how to obtain an  instrument rating.  

When faced with deteriorating weather, planning and  prevention, not recovery, are the best strategies to eliminate  UIMC-related accidents and fatalities.  

# Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear  

Both Canada and Alaska require pilots to carry survival  gear. Always carry survival gear when flying over rugged  and desolate terrain. The items suggested in  Figure 11-12 are both weather and terrain dependent. The pilot also needs  to consider how much storage space the helicopter has and  how the equipment being carried affects the overall weight  and balance of the helicopter.  

# Chapter Summary  

Emergencies should always be anticipated. Knowledge  of the helicopter, possible malfunctions and failures, and  methods of recovery can help the pilot avoid accidents and  be a safer pilot. Helicopter pilots should always expect the  worse hazards and possible aerodynamic effects and plan for  a safe exit path or procedure to compensate for the hazard.  

# Chapter 12 Night Operations  

# Introduction  

Pilots rely more on vision than on any other sense to orient  themselves in flight. The following visual factors contribute  to flying performance: good depth perception for safe  landings, good visual acuity to identify terrain features and  obstacles in the flightpath, and good color vision. Although  vision is the most accurate and reliable sense, visual cues can  be misleading, contributing to incidents occurring within the  flight environment. Pilots should be aware of and know how  to compensate effectively for the following:  

•	 Physical deficiency or self-imposed stress, such as  

•	 Visual cue deficiencies  •	 Limitations in visual acuity, dark adaptation, and color  and depth perception  

For example, at night, the unaided eye has degraded visual  acuity. For more information on night operations, reference  Chapter 17, Aeromedical Factors, of the Pilot’s Handbook  of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25, as revised).  

# Visual Deficiencies  

# Night Myopia  

At night, blue wavelengths of light prevail in the visible  portion of the spectrum. Therefore, slightly nearsighted  (myopic) individuals viewing blue-green light at night may  experience blurred vision. Even pilots with perfect vision find  that image sharpness decreases as pupil diameter increases.  For individuals with mild refractive errors, these factors  combine to make vision unacceptably blurred unless they  wear corrective glasses. Another factor to consider is “dark  focus.” When light levels decrease, the focusing mechanism  of the eye may move toward a resting position and make the  eye more myopic. These factors become important when  pilots rely on terrain features during unaided night flights.  Practicing good light discipline is very important and helps  pilots to retain their night adaptation. Keeping the cockpit  lighting on dim allows the pilot to better identify outside  details, unmarked hazards such as towers less than   $200^{\circ}$  AGL, and unimproved landing sites with no hazard lighting.  

A simple exercise that shows the effect of high versus low  light contrast would be to go out to a very dark road and  turn the dash board lights down very low or off and let your  eyes adjust to the ambient light level. Then, turn the dash  board lights up and note how the outside features disappear.  The same concept applies to cockpit lighting and being able  to see the surrounding terrain and obstacles.  [Figure 12-1] Special corrective lenses can be prescribed to pilots who  experience night myopia.  

The eye automatically adjusts for the light level experienced.  During night flight, the cockpit and instrument lights should  

![](images/625ae4f270df851c57e73bb03b068c5340aeba45738aed8fa63fca0963567467.jpg)  
Figure 12-1.  Effects of dimming cockpit lighting during night flight  to better see surrounding terrain.  

be as dim as possible. The eye can then adjust for the outside  lighting conditions (ambient lighting) to see outside. The  dimmer the inside lighting is, the better you can see outside.  

# Hyperopia  

Hyperopia is also caused by an error in refraction. In a  hyperopic state, when a pilot views a near image, the actual  focal point of the eye is behind the retinal plane (wall),  causing blurred vision. Objects that are nearby are not seen  clearly; only more distant objects are in focus. This problem,  is referred to as farsightedness .  

# Astigmatism  

An unequal curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye causes  this condition. A ray of light is spread over a diffused area  in one meridian. In normal vision, a ray of light is sharply  focused on the retina. Astigmatism is the inability to  focus different meridians simultaneously. If, for example,  astigmatic individuals focus on power poles (vertical),  the wires (horizontal) are out of focus for most of them.  [Figure 12-2]  

# Presbyopia  

This condition is part of the normal aging process, which  causes the lens to harden. Beginning in the early teens, the  human eye gradually loses the ability to accommodate for  and focus on nearby objects. When people are about 40 years  old, their eyes are unable to focus at normal reading distances  without reading glasses. Reduced illumination interferes with  focus depth and accommodation ability. Hardening of the lens  may also result in clouding of the lens (cataract formation).  Aviators with early cataracts may see a standard eye chart  clearly under normal daylight but have difficulty seeing under  bright light conditions. This problem is due to light scattering  as it enters the eye. This glare sensitivity is disabling under  certain circumstances. Glare disability, related to contrast  sensitivity, is the ability to detect objects against varying  shades of backgrounds. Other visual functions decline with  age and affect the aircrew member’s performance:  

• 	 Dynamic acuity • 	 Recovery from glare • 	 Function under low illumination • 	 Information processing  

# Vision in Flight  

The visual sense is especially important in collision  avoidance and depth perception. Due to the structure of the  human eye, illusions and blindspots occur. The more pilots  understand the eye and how it functions, the easier it is to  compensate for these illusions and blindspots.  Figure 12-3 shows the basic anatomy of the human eye and how it is like

a camera. A camera is able to focus on near and far objects  by changing the distance between the lens and the film.  With the eye on the other hand, objects can be seen clearly  at various distances because the shape of its lens is changed  automatically by small muscles.  

# Visual Acuity  

Normal visual acuity, or sharpness, is 20/20. A value of  20/80 indicates that an individual reads at 20 feet the letters  that an individual with normal acuity (20/20) reads at 80  feet away. The human eye functions like a camera. It has  an instantaneous field of view, which is oval and typically  measures   $120^{\circ}$   vertically by   $150^{\circ}$   horizontally. When both  eyes are used for viewing, the overall field of vision measures  about   $120^{\circ}$   vertically by  $200^{\circ}$   horizontally.  

# The Eye  

Vision is primarily the result of light striking a photosensitive  layer, called the retina, at the back of the eye. The retina is  composed of light-sensitive cones and rods. The cones in the  eye perceive an image best when the light is bright, while the  rods work best in low light. The pattern of light that strikes  the cones and rods is transmitted as electrical impulses by the  optic nerve to the brain where these signals are interpreted  as an image.  

# Cones  

Cones are concentrated around the center of the retina. They  gradually diminish in number as the distance from the center  increases. Cones allow color perception by sensing red, blue,  and green light. Directly behind the lens, on the retina, is  a small, notched area called the fovea. This area contains  only a high concentration of cone receptors. The best vision  in daylight is obtained by looking directly at the object.  This focuses the image on the fovea, where detail is best  seen. The cones, however, do not function well in darkness,  which explains why color is not seen as vividly at night as  it is during the day.  

# Rods  

Concentrated outside the fovea area, the rods are the dim  light and night receptors. The number of rods increases as the  distance from the fovea increases. Rods sense images only  in black and white. Because the rods are not located directly  behind the pupil, they are responsible for most peripheral  vision. Images that move are perceived more easily by the  rod areas than by the cones in the fovea. If you have ever  seen something move out of the corner of your eye, it was  most likely detected by rod receptors.  

In low light, the cones lose much of their function, while  rods become more receptive. The eye sacrifices sharpness for  sensitivity. The ability to see an object directly in front of you is  reduced, and much depth perception is lost, as well as judgment  of size. The concentration of cones in the fovea can make a  night blindspot at the center of vision. How well a person sees  at night is determined by the rods in the eyes, as well as by the  amount of light allowed into the eyes. At night, the wider the  pupil is open at night, the better night vision becomes.  

# Night Vision  

Diet and general physical health have an impact on how well  a person can see in the dark. Deficiencies in vitamins A and C  have been shown to reduce night acuity. Other factors, such  as carbon monoxide poisoning, smoking, alcohol, and certain  drugs can greatly decrease night vision. Lack of oxygen can  also decrease night vision as the eye requires more oxygen  per unit weight than any other part of the body.  

# Night Scanning  

Good night visual acuity is needed for collision avoidance.  Night scanning, like day scanning, uses a series of short,  regularly spaced eye movements in   $10^{\circ}$   sectors. Unlike day  scanning, however, off-center viewing is used to focus objects  on the rods rather than the fovea blindspot.  [Figure 12-4]  When  looking at an object, avoid staring at it too long. If staring  at an object without moving the eyes, the retina becomes  accustomed to the light intensity and the image begins to  fade. To keep it clearly visible, new areas in the retina must  be exposed to the image. Small, circular eye movements help  eliminate the fading. Also, move the eyes more slowly from  sector to sector than during the day to prevent blurring.  

During daylight, objects can be perceived at a great distance  with good detail. At night, range is limited, and detail is poor.  Objects along the flight path can be more readily identified at  night, by using the proper techniques to scan the terrain. To  

![](images/6d7b30c8b99521dcdbbce10d2c3be5da278965e54466301eb76135b769db9553.jpg)  
Figure 12-4.  Off-center vision technique.  

scan effectively, pilots look from side to side. They should  begin scanning at the greatest distance at which an object  can be perceived high on the horizon, thence moving inward  toward the position of the aircraft.  Figure 12-5  shows this  scanning pattern. Because the light-sensitive elements of  the retina are unable to perceive images that are in motion, a  stop-turn-stop-turn motion should be used. For each stop, an  area about 30 degrees wide should be scanned. This viewing  angle includes an area about 250 meters wide at a distance of  500 meters. The duration of each stop is based on the degree  of detail that is required, but no stop should last more than  two or three seconds. When moving from one viewing point  to the next, pilots should overlap the previous field of view  by 10 degrees. This scanning technique allows greater clarity  in observing the periphery. Other scanning techniques, as  illustrated in  Figure 12-6,  may be developed to fit the situation.  

# Obstruction Detection  

Obstructions having poor reflective surfaces, such as wires  and small tree limbs, are difficult to detect. The best way to  

![](images/b029dfe8b001ad2862fbb61e5d11399ec4e3d2eda44f2c9d3003819d1089ad22.jpg)

locate wires is by looking for the support structures. However,  pilots should review the most current hazard maps with  known wire locations before night flights.  

# Aircraft Lighting  

In order to see other aircraft more clearly, regulations require  that all aircraft operating during the night hours have special  lights and equipment. The requirements for operating at night  are found in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) part 91. In addition to aircraft lighting, the regulations  also provide a definition of night flight in accordance with  14 CFR part 91, currency requirements, fuel reserves, and  necessary electrical systems.  

Position lights enable a pilot to locate another aircraft, as  well as help determine its direction of flight. The approved  aircraft lights for night operations are a green light on the  right cabin side or wingtip, a red light on the left cabin side  or wingtip, and a white position light on the tail. In addition,  flashing aviation red or white anticollision lights are required  for all flights, if equipped on the aircraft and in an operable  condition (in accordance with 14 CFR Section 91.209(b),  which aids in the identification during night conditions).  These flashing lights can be in a number of locations but are  most commonly found on the top and bottom of the cabin.  

Figure 12-7  shows examples of aircraft lighting. By  interpreting the position lights on other aircraft, the pilot in  aircraft 3 can determine whether the aircraft is flying in the  opposite direction or is on a collision course. If a red position  light is seen to the right of a green light, such as shown by  aircraft 1, it is flying toward aircraft 3. A pilot should watch  this aircraft closely and be ready to change course. Aircraft 2,

on the other hand, is flying away from aircraft 3, as indicated  by the white position light.  

# Visual Illusions  

Illusions give false impressions or misconceptions of actual  conditions; therefore, pilots must understand the type of  illusions that can occur and the resulting disorientation.  Although the eye is the most reliable of the senses, some  illusions can result from misinterpreting what is seen; what  is perceived is not always accurate. Even with the references  outside the cockpit and the display of instruments inside,  pilots must be on guard to interpret information correctly.  

# Relative-Motion Illusion  

Relative motion is the falsely perceived self-motion in  relation to the motion of another object. The most common  example is as follows. An individual in a car is stopped at a  traffic light and another car pulls alongside. The individual  who was stopped at the light perceives the forward motion  of the second car as his or her own motion rearward. This  results in the individual applying more pressure to the brakes  unnecessarily. This illusion can be encountered during flight  in situations such as formation flight, hover taxi, or hovering  over water or tall grass.  

# Confusion with Ground Lights  

Confusion with ground lights occurs when a pilot mistakes  ground lights for stars. The pilot can place the helicopter  in an extremely dangerous flight attitude if he or she aligns  it with the wrong lights. In  Figure 12-8A , the helicopter is  aligned with a road and not with the horizon. Isolated ground  lights can appear as stars and could lead to the illusion that  the helicopter is in a nose-high attitude.  

When no stars are visible because of overcast conditions,  unlighted areas of terrain can blend with the dark overcast to  create the illusion that the unlighted terrain is part of the sky  in  Figure 12-8B.  In this illusion, the shoreline is mistaken for  the horizon. In an attempt to correct for the apparent nose- high attitude, a pilot may lower the collective and attempt  to fly “beneath the shore.” This illusion can be avoided by  referencing the flight instruments and establishing a true  horizon and attitude.  

# Reversible Perspective Illusion  

At night, an aircraft or helicopter may appear to be moving  away when it is actually approaching. If the pilot of each  aircraft has the same assumption, and the rate of closure  is significant, by the time each pilot realizes his or her  own error in assumption, it may be too late to avoid a  mishap. This illusion is called reversible perspective and  is often experienced when a pilot observes another aircraft  

![](images/10ab95446b5e02c784823c3addc24e85f67f2cbf5c4df10212a42c452a2c1720.jpg)  
Figure 12-8.  At night, the horizon may be hard to discern due to dark terrain and misleading light patterns on the ground.  

or helicopter flying an approaching, parallel course. To  determine the direction of flight, the pilot should observe the  other aircraft’s position lights. Remember the following: red  on right returning; that is, if an aircraft is seen with the red  position light on the right and the green position light on the  left, the observed aircraft is traveling in the opposite direction.  

# Flicker Vertigo  

Flicker vertigo is technically not an illusion; however, as  most people are aware from personal experience, viewing  a flickering light can be both distracting and annoying.  Flicker vertigo may be created by helicopter rotor blades or  airplane propellers interrupting direct sunlight at a rate of 4  to 20 cycles per second. Flashing anticollision strobe lights,  especially while the aircraft is in the clouds, can also produce  this effect. One should also be aware that photic stimuli at  certain frequencies could produce seizures in those rare  individuals who are susceptible to flicker-induced epilepsy.  

# Night Flight  

The night flying environment and the techniques used when  flying at night depend on outside conditions. Flying on a  bright, clear, moonlit evening when the visibility is good, and  the wind is calm is not much different from flying during the  day. However, if flying on an overcast night over a sparsely  populated area, with few or no outside lights on the ground,  the situation is quite different. Visibility is restricted, so be  more alert in steering clear of obstructions and low clouds.  Options are also limited in the event of an emergency, as it  is more difficult to find a place to land and determine wind  direction and speed. At night, rely more heavily on the aircraft  systems, such as lights, flight instruments, and navigation  equipment. As a precaution, if visibility is limited or outside  references are inadequate, strongly consider delaying the  flight until conditions improve, unless proper instrument  flight training has been received and the helicopter has the  appropriate instrumentation and equipment.  

# Preflight  

Aircraft preflight inspection is a critical aspect of flight  safety. It must comply with the appropriate rotorcraft flight  manual (RFM). Preflight should be scheduled as early as  possible in the flight planning sequence, preferably during  daylight hours, allowing time for maintenance assistance and  correction. If a night preflight is necessary, a flashlight with  an unfiltered lens (white light) should be used to supplement  lighting. Oil and hydraulic fluid levels and leaks are difficult  to detect with a blue-green or red lens. Windscreens should  be checked to ensure they are clean and relatively free of  scratches. Slight scratches are acceptable for day flight but  may not be for night flight. The search light or landing light  should be positioned for the best possible illumination during  an emergency descent.  

Careful attention must be paid to the aircraft electrical system.  In helicopters equipped with fuses, a spare set is required  by regulation, and by common sense, so make sure they are  on board. If the helicopter is equipped with circuit breakers,  check to see that they are not tripped. A tripped circuit breaker  may be an indication of an equipment malfunction and should  be left for maintenance to troubleshoot before flying.  

All aircraft operating between sunset and sunrise are required  to have operable navigation (position) lights. Turn these lights  on during the preflight to inspect them visually for proper  operation. Between sunset and sunrise, these lights must be  on any time the helicopter is operating.  

All recently manufactured aircraft certificated for night  flight must have an anticollision light that makes the aircraft  more visible to other pilots. This light is either a red or white  flashing light and may be in the form of a rotating beacon  or a strobe. While anticollision lights are required for night  visual flight rules (VFR) flights, they may be turned off any  time they create a distraction for the pilot.  

One of the first steps in preparation for night flight is to  become thoroughly familiar with the helicopter’s cockpit,  instrumentation, and control layout. It is recommended that  a pilot practice locating each instrument, control, and switch,  both with and without cabin lights. Since the markings on  some switches and circuit breaker panels may be difficult  to read at night, be able to locate and use these devices, and  read the markings in poor light conditions. Before starting  the engine, make sure all necessary equipment and supplies  needed for the flight, such as charts, notepads, and flashlights,  are accessible and ready for use.  

# Cockpit Lights  

Check all interior lights with special attention to the instrument  and panel lights. The panel lighting can usually be controlled  with a rheostat or dimmer switch, allowing the pilot to adjust  the intensity. If a particular light is too bright or causes  reflection or glare off the windshield, it should be adjusted or  turned off. As ambient light level decreases from twilight to  darkness, intensity of the cockpit lights is reduced to a low,  usable intensity level that reduces any glare or reflection off  the windshield. The light level should be adjusted to as close  to the ambient light level as possible. A flashlight, with red or  blue-green lens filter, or map light can supplement the available  light in the cockpit. Always carry a flashlight with fresh  batteries to provide an alternate source of light if the interior  lights malfunction. If an existing map/utility light is used, it  should be hand-held or remounted to a convenient location.  In order to retain night adaptation, use low level light when  using your checklist. Brief your passengers on the importance  of light discipline during night flight so the pilot is not blinded,  causing loss of dark adaptation.  

# Engine Starting and Rotor Engagement  

Use extra caution when starting the engine and engaging the  rotors, especially in dark areas with little or no outside lights.  In addition to the usual call of “clear,” turn on the position  and anticollision lights. If conditions permit, also turn the  landing light on momentarily to help warn others that the  engine is about to start and engage the rotors.  

# Taxi Technique  

Landing lights usually cast a beam that is narrow and  concentrated ahead of the helicopter, so illumination to the  side is minimal. Therefore, slow the taxi at night, especially  in congested ramp and parking areas. Some helicopters have  a hover light in addition to a landing light, which illuminates  a larger area under the helicopter.  

When operating at an unfamiliar airport at night, ask for  instructions or advice concerning local conditions, so as to  avoid taxiing into areas of construction, or unlighted, unmarked  obstructions. Ground controllers or UNICOM operators are  usually cooperative in furnishing this type of information.  

# Night Traffic Patterns  

Traffic patterns are covered in Chapter 9, Basic Flight  Maneuvers, but the following additional considerations  should be taken into account when flying a helicopter in a  night traffic pattern:  

1.	 The minimum recommended pattern height at night  is 1,000 feet when able. 2.	 If possible, consider taking the right hand night pattern  with fixed wing in the left hand pattern for extra  separation, but if needed, conform and integrate with  the fixed wing using the same pattern height. 3.	 Be extra vigilant on abiding with noise abatement  procedures at night. 4.	 Always plan to use the lit runway at night for  unaided (no night vision equipment) approaches and  departures. 5.	 Avoid downwind and crosswind approaches at night  when able.  

# Takeoff  

Before takeoff, make sure that there is a clear, unobstructed  takeoff path. At airports, this is accomplished by taking  off over a runway or taxi way, however, if operating off- airport, pay more attention to the surroundings. Obstructions  may also be difficult to see if taking off from an unlighted  area. Once a suitable takeoff path is chosen, select a point  down the takeoff path to use for directional reference. The  landing light should be positioned in order to illuminate  the tallest obstacles in the takeoff path. During a night  takeoff, notice a lack of reliable outside visual references  after becoming airborne. This is particularly true at small  airports and off-airport landing sites located in sparsely  populated areas. To compensate for the lack of outside  references, use the available flight instruments as an aid.  Check the altimeter and the airspeed indicator to verify the  proper climb attitude. An attitude indicator, if installed, can  enhance attitude reference.  

The first 500 feet of altitude after takeoff is considered to be  the most critical period in transitioning from the comparatively  well-lit airport or heliport into what sometimes appears to be  total darkness. A takeoff at night is usually an “altitude over  airspeed” maneuver, meaning a pilot most likely performs  a nearly maximum performance takeoff. This improves the  chances for obstacle clearance and enhances safety.  

# En Route Procedures  

In order to provide a higher margin of safety, it is  recommended that a cruising altitude somewhat higher than  normal be selected. There are three reasons for this. First,  a higher altitude gives more clearance between obstacles,  especially those that are difficult to see at night, such as high- tension wires and unlighted towers. Second, in the event of  an engine failure, there is more time to set up for a landing  and the greater gliding distance gives more options for a safe  landing. Third, radio reception is improved, particularly if  using radio aids for navigation.  

During preflight planning, when possible, it is recommended  that a route of flight be selected that is within reach of an  airport, or any safe landing site. It is also recommended  that pilots fly as close as possible to a populated or lighted  area, such as a highway or town. Not only does this offer  more options in the event of an emergency, but also makes  navigation a lot easier. A course comprised of a series of  slight zigzags to stay close to suitable landing sites and  well-lit areas, only adds a little more time and distance to an  otherwise straight course.  

In the event of a forced landing at night, use the same  procedure recommended for day time emergency landings.  If available, turn on the landing light during the final descent  to help in avoiding obstacles along the approach path.  

# Collision Avoidance at Night  

Because the quantity and quality of outside visual references  are greatly reduced, a pilot tends to focus on a single point  or instrument, making him or her less aware of the other  traffic around. Make a special effort to devote enough time  to scan for traffic. As discussed previously in this chapter,  effective scanning is accomplished with a series of short,  regularly spaced eye movements that bring successive  areas of the sky into the central visual field. Contrary to  the 30-degree scan used to view the ground in the case of  scanning for other aircraft, each movement in this case  should not exceed 10 degrees, and each area should be  observed for at least 1 second to enable detection. If the  pilot detects a dimly lit object in a certain direction, the  pilot should not look directly at the object, but scan the area  adjacent to it, called off-center viewing. This will decrease  the chances of fixating on the light and allow focusing more  on the objects (e.g., tower, aircraft, ground lights). Short  stops of a few seconds in duration in each scan will help to  detect the light and its movement. A pilot can determine  another aircraft’s direction of flight by interpreting the  position and anticollision lights, as previously described.  When scanning, pilots should also remember to move their  heads, not just their eyes. Ground obstructions can cover  a considerable amount of sky, and the area can easily be  uncovered by a small head movement.  

# Approach and Landing  

Night approaches and landings do have some advantages over  daytime approaches, as the air is generally smoother, and the  disruptive effects of turbulence and excessive crosswinds are  often absent. However, there are a few special considerations  and techniques that apply to approaches at night. For  example, when landing at night, especially at an unfamiliar  airport, make the approach to a lighted runway and then use  the taxiways to avoid unlighted obstructions or equipment.  

Carefully controlled studies have revealed that pilots have a  tendency to make lower approaches at night than during the  day. This is potentially dangerous as there is a greater chance  of hitting an obstacle, such as an overhead wire or fence, that is  difficult to see. It is good practice to make steeper approaches at  night, increasing the probability of clearing obstacles. Monitor  altitude and rate of descent using the altimeter.  

Another pilot tendency during night flight is to focus too  much on the landing area and not pay enough attention to  airspeed. If too much airspeed is lost, a vortex ring state  condition may result. Maintain the proper attitude during  the approach, and ensure that you keep some forward  airspeed and movement until close to the ground. Outside  visual references for airspeed and rate of closure may not be  available, especially when landing in an unlit area, so pay  special attention to the airspeed indicator.  

Although the landing light is a helpful aid when making  night approaches, there is an inherent disadvantage. The  portion of the landing area illuminated by the landing light  seems higher than the dark area surrounding it. This effect  can cause a pilot to terminate the approach at an altitude that  is too high, which may result in a vortex ring state condition  and a hard landing.  

# Illusions Leading to Landing Errors  

Various surface features and atmospheric conditions  encountered in night landing can create illusions of incorrect  height above and distance from the runway threshold.  Landing errors from these illusions can be prevented by  anticipating them during approaches, conducting an aerial  visual inspection of unfamiliar airports before landing, using  electronic glideslope or VASI systems when available, and  maintaining optimum proficiency in landing procedures.  

# Featureless Terrain Illusion  

An absence of ground features, as when landing over water,  darkened areas, and terrain made featureless by snow, can  create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than  it actually is. The pilot who does not recognize this illusion  will fly a lower approach.  

# Atmospheric Illusions  

Rain on the windscreen can create the illusion of greater  height, and atmospheric haze can create the illusion of being  at a greater distance from the runway. The pilot who does not  recognize these illusions flies a higher approach. Penetration  of fog can create the illusion of pitching up. The pilot who  does not recognize this illusion steepens the approach, often  quite abruptly.  

# Ground Lighting Illusions  

Lights along a straight path can be mistaken for runway  and approach lights. This might include street lights along a  roadside or even the internal lights of a moving train. Another  illusion may occur with very intense runway and approach  lighting. Due to the relative brightness of these lights, the  pilot may perceive them to be closer than they really are.  Assuming that the lights are as close as they appear, the  pilot may attempt an approach that is actually lower than  glideslope. Conversely, the pilot flying over terrain with few  lights may make a lower than normal approach.  

# Helicopter Night VFR Operations  

While ceiling and visibility significantly affect safety in night  VFR operations, lighting conditions also have a profound  effect on safety. Even in conditions in which visibility and  ceiling are determined to be visual meteorological conditions,  the ability to discern unlit or low contrast objects and terrain  at night may be compromised. The ability to discern these  objects and terrain is referred to as the “seeing condition,”  and is related to the amount of natural and man-made  lighting available, and the contrast, reflectivity, and texture  of surface terrain and obstruction features. In order to conduct  operations safely, seeing conditions must be accounted for in  the planning and execution of night VFR operations.  

Night VFR seeing conditions can be described by identifying  high lighting conditions and low lighting conditions.  

High lighting conditions exist when one of two sets of  conditions are present:  

1.	 The sky cover is less than broken (less than  $\%$   cloud  cover), the time is between the local moon rise and  moon set, and the lunar disk is at least 50 percent  illuminated; or  

2.	 The aircraft is operated over surface lighting that, at  least, provides lighting of prominent obstacles, the  identification of terrain features (shorelines, valleys,  hills, mountains, slopes) and a horizontal reference  by which the pilot may control the helicopter. For  example, this surface lighting may be the result of:  

a.	 Extensive cultural lighting (manmade, such as a  built-up area of a city), b.	 Significant reflected cultural lighting (such as the  illumination caused by the reflection of a major  metropolitan area’s lighting reflecting off a cloud  ceiling), or c.	 Limited cultural lighting combined with a  high level of natural reflectivity of celestial  illumination, such as that provided by a surface  covered by snow or a desert surface.  

Low lighting conditions are those that do not meet the high  lighting conditions requirements.  

Some areas may be considered a high lighting environment  only in specific circumstances. For example, some surfaces,  such as a forest with limited cultural lighting, normally  have little reflectivity, requiring dependence on significant  moonlight to achieve a high lighting condition. However,  when that same forest is covered with snow, its reflectivity  may support a high lighting condition based only on starlight.  Similarly, a desolate area, with little cultural lighting, such as  a desert, may have such inherent natural reflectivity that it  may be considered a high lighting conditions area regardless  of season, provided the cloud cover does not prevent starlight  from being reflected from the surface. Other surfaces, such  as areas of open water, may never have enough reflectivity or  cultural lighting to ever be characterized as a high lighting area.  

Through the accumulation of night flying experience in a  particular area, the pilot develops the ability to determine,  prior to departure, which areas can be considered supporting  high or low lighting conditions. Without that pilot experience,  low lighting considerations should be applied by pilots for  both preflight planning and operations until high lighting  conditions are observed or determined to be regularly  available. Even if the aircraft is certified for day and night  VFR conditions, night flight should only be conducted if  adequate celestial illumination is assured during the entirety  of the flight.  

# Chapter Summary  

Knowledge of the basic anatomy and physiology of the eye  is helpful in the study of helicopter night operations. Adding  to that knowledge a study of visual illusions gives the pilot  ways to overcome those illusions. Techniques for preflight,  engine start-up, collision avoidance, and night approach and  landings help teach the pilot safer ways to conduct flight at  night. More detailed information on the subjects discussed  in this chapter is available in the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM) and online at www.faa.gov.  

# Effective Aeronautical  Decision-Making  

# Introduction  

The accident rate for helicopters has traditionally been higher  than the accident rate of fixed-wing aircraft, probably due to  the helicopter’s unique capabilities to fly and land in more  diverse situations than fixed-wing aircraft and pilot attempts  to fly the helicopter beyond the limits of his or her abilities or  beyond the capabilities of the helicopter. With no significant  improvement in helicopter accident rates for the last 20 years,  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has joined with  various members of the helicopter community to improve  the safety of helicopter operations.  

According to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  statistics, approximately 80 percent of all aviation accidents  are caused by pilot error, the human factor. Many of  these accidents are the result of the failure of instructors  to incorporate single-pilot resource management (SRM)  and risk management into flight training instruction of  aeronautical decision-making (ADM).  

SRM is defined as the art of managing all the resources (both  on board the aircraft and from outside sources) available to a  pilot prior to and during flight to ensure a successful flight.  When properly applied, SRM is a key component of ADM.  Additional discussion includes integral topics such as, the  concepts of risk management, workload or task management,  situational awareness, controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)  awareness, and automation management.  

ADM is all about learning how to gather information, analyze  it, and make decisions. It helps the pilot accurately assess  and manage risk and make accurate and timely decisions.  Although the flight is coordinated by a single person, the  use of available resources, such as air traffic control (ATC)  and flight service stations (FSS)/automated flight service  stations (AFSS), replicates the principles of crew resource  management (CRM) (see page 14-7).  

References on SRM and ADM include:

# Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)  

Making good choices sounds easy enough. However,  there are a multitude of factors that come into play when  these choices, and subsequent decisions, are made in the  aeronautical world. Many tools are available for pilots to  become more self-aware and assess the options available,  along with the impact of their decision. Yet, with all the  available resources, accident rates are not being reduced. Poor  decisions continue to be made, frequently resulting in lives  being lost and/or aircraft damaged or destroyed. The Risk  Management Handbook discusses ADM and SRM in detail  and should be thoroughly read and understood.  

While progress is continually being made in the advancement  of pilot training methods, aircraft equipment and systems, and  services for pilots, accidents still occur. Historically, the term  “pilot error” has been used to describe the causes of these  accidents. Pilot error means an action or decision made by  the pilot was the cause of, or a contributing factor that led to,  the accident. This definition also includes the pilot’s failure to  make a decision or take action. From a broader perspective,  the phrase “human factors related” more aptly describes these  accidents since it is usually not a single decision that leads  to an accident, but a chain of events triggered by a number  of factors.  [Figure 13-1]  

The poor judgment chain, sometimes referred to as the  “error chain,” is a term used to describe this concept of  contributing factors in a human factors related accident.  Breaking one link in the chain is often the only event  necessary to change the outcome of the sequence of  events. The following is an example of the type of scenario  illustrating the poor judgment chain.  

# Scenario  

A Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) pilot is nearing the end  of his shift when he receives a request for a patient pickup  at a roadside vehicle accident. The pilot has started to feel  the onset of a cold; his thoughts are on getting home and  getting a good night’s sleep. After receiving the request, the  pilot checks the accident location and required flightpath  to determine if he has time to complete the flight to the  scene, then on to the hospital before his shift expires. The  pilot checks the weather and determines that, although  thunderstorms are approaching, the flight can be completed  prior to their arrival.  

![](images/5e56557fb84a1fbb6f2d5435f8f0be6d53dcf8aa42a07386741826daf3d88e12.jpg)  
Figure 13-1.  The pilot has a limited capacity of doing work and handling tasks, meaning there is a point at which the tasking exceeds  the pilot’s capability. When this happens, either tasks are not done properly or some are not done at all.  

The pilot and on-board medical crews depart the home  location and arrive overhead, at the scene of the vehicular  accident. The pilot is not comfortable with the selected  landing area due to tall trees in all quadrants of the confined  area. The pilot searches for a secondary landing area. Unable  to find one nearby, the pilot then returns to the initial landing  area and decides he can make it work.  

After successfully landing the aircraft, he is told that there  will be a delay before the patient is loaded because more time  is needed to extricate the patient from the wreckage. Knowing  his shift is nearly over, the pilot begins to feel pressured to  “hurry up” or he will require an extension for his duty day.  

After 30 minutes, the patient is loaded, and the pilot ensures  everyone is secure. He notes that the storm is now nearby and  that winds have picked up considerably. The pilot thinks, “No  turning back now, the patient is on board and I’m running out  of time.” The pilot knows he must take off almost vertically  to clear the obstacles and chooses his departure path based  on the observed wind during landing. Moments later, prior to  clearing the obstacles, the aircraft begins an uncontrollable  spin and augers back to the ground, seriously injuring all on  board and destroying the aircraft.  

What could the pilot have done differently to break this  error chain? More important—what would you have done  differently? By discussing the events that led to this accident,  you should develop an understanding of how a series of  judgmental errors contributed to the final outcome of this flight.  

For example, the pilot’s decision to fly the aircraft knowing  that the effects of an illness were present was the initial  contributing factor. The pilot was aware of his illness, but,  was he aware of the impact of the symptoms—fatigue,  general uneasy feeling due to a slight fever, perhaps?  

Next, knowing the shift was about to end, the pilot based his  time required to complete the flight on ideal conditions, and  did not take into consideration the possibility of delays. This  led to a feeling of being time limited.  

Even after determining the landing area was unsuitable, the  pilot forced the landing due to time constraints. At any time  during this sequence, the pilot could have aborted the flight  rather than risk crew lives. Instead, the pilot became blinded  by a determination to continue.  

After landing, and waiting 30 minutes longer than planned,  the pilot observed the outer effects of the thunderstorm, yet  still attempted to depart. The pilot dispelled any available  options by thinking the only option was to go forward;  however, it would have been safer to discontinue the flight.  

Using the same departure path selected under different wind  conditions, the pilot took off and encountered winds that  led to loss of aircraft control. Once again faced with a self- imposed time constraint, the pilot improperly chose to depart  the confined area. The end result: instead of one patient to  transport by ground (had the pilot aborted the flight at any  point), there were four patients to be transported.  

On numerous occasions leading to and during the flight, the  pilot could have made effective decisions that could have  prevented this accident. However, as the chain of events  unfolded, each poor decision left him with fewer options.  Making sound decisions is the key to preventing accidents.  Traditional pilot training emphasizes flying skills, knowledge  of the aircraft, and familiarity with regulations. SRM and  ADM training focus on the decision-making process and on  the factors that affect a pilot’s ability to make effective choices.  

# Trescott Tips  

Max Trescott, Master Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI)  and Master Ground Instructor and winner of the 2008 CFI of  the year, has published numerous safety tips that every pilot  should heed. He believes that the word “probably” should  be purged from our flying vocabulary. Mr. Trescott contends  that “probably” means we’ve done an informal assessment  of the likelihood of an event occurring and have assigned a  probability to it. He believes the term implies that we believe  things are likely to work out, but there’s some reasonable  doubt in our mind. He further explains that if you ever think  that your course of action will “probably work out,” you  need to choose a new option that you know will work out.  

Another safety tip details the importance of accumulating  flight hours in one specific airframe type. He explains that  “statistics have shown that accidents are correlated more with  the number of hours of experience a pilot has in a particular  aircraft model and not with his or her total number of flight  hours. Accidents tend to decrease after a pilot accumulates  at least 100 hours of experience in the aircraft he or she is  flying. Thus, when learning to fly, or when transitioning into  a new model, your goal should be to concentrate your flying  hours in that model.” He suggests waiting until you reach 100  hours of experience in one particular model before attempting  a dual rating with another model. In addition, if you only fly  a few hours per year, maximize your safety by concentrating  those hours in just one aircraft model.  

The third safety tip that is well worth mentioning is what  Mr. Trescott calls “building experience from the armchair.”  Armchair flying is simply closing your eyes and mentally  practicing exactly what you do in the aircraft. This is an  excellent way to practice making radio calls, departures,  approaches and even visualizing the parts and pieces of the  aircraft. This type of flying does not cost a dime and will  make you a better prepared and more proficient pilot.  

All three of Max Trescott’s safety tips incorporate the ADM  process and emphasize the importance of how safety and  good decision-making is essential to aviation.  

# The Decision-Making Process  

An understanding of the decision-making process provides  a pilot with a foundation for developing ADM skills. Some  situations, such as engine failures, require a pilot to respond  immediately using established procedures with little time  for detailed analysis. Called automatic decision-making,  it is based upon training, experience, and recognition.  Traditionally, pilots have been well trained to react to  emergencies, but are not as well prepared to make decisions  that require a more reflective response when greater analysis  is necessary. They often overlook the phase of decision- making that is accomplished on the ground: the preflight,  flight planning, performance planning, weather briefing, and  weight/center of gravity configurations. Thorough and proper  completion of these tasks provides increased awareness and  a base of knowledge available to the pilot prior to departure  and once airborne. Typically during a flight, a pilot has time  to examine any changes that occur, gather information, and  assess risk before reaching a decision. The steps leading to  this conclusion constitute the decision-making process.  

# Defining the Problem  

Defining the problem is the first step in the decision-making  process and begins with recognizing that a change has  occurred or that an expected change did not occur. A problem  is perceived first by the senses, then is distinguished through  insight (self-awareness) and experience. Insight, experience,  and objective analysis of all available information are used to  determine the exact nature and severity of the problem. One  critical error that can be made during the decision-making  process is incorrectly defining the problem.  

While going through the following example, keep in mind what  errors lead up to the event. What planning could have been  completed prior to departing that may have led to avoiding  this situation? What instruction could the pilot have had  during training that may have better prepared the pilot for this  scenario? Could the pilot have assessed potential problems  based on what the aircraft “felt like” at a hover? All these  factors go into recognizing a change and the timely response.  

While doing a hover check after picking up firefighters at  the bottom of a canyon, a pilot realized that she was only  20 pounds under maximum gross weight. What she failed  to realize was that the firefighters had stowed some of their  heaviest gear in the baggage compartment, which shifted  the center of gravity (CG) slightly behind the aft limits.  Since weight and balance had never created any problems  for her in the past, she did not bother to calculate CG and  power required. She did try to estimate it by remembering  the figures from earlier in the morning at the base camp.  At a 5,000-foot density altitude   $(D A)$   and maximum gross  weight, the performance charts indicated the helicopter  had plenty of excess power. Unfortunately, the temperature  was  $93\ ^{\circ}F$   and the pressure altitude at the pickup point was  6,200 feet   $(D A=9{,}600$   feet). Since there was enough power  for the hover check, the pilot decided there was sufficient  power to takeoff.  

Even though the helicopter accelerated slowly during the  takeoff, the distance between the helicopter and the ground  continued to increase. However, when the pilot attempted to  establish the best rate of climb speed, the nose tended to pitch  up to a higher-than-normal attitude, and the pilot noticed that  the helicopter was not gaining enough altitude in relation to  the canyon wall approximately 200 yards ahead.  

# Choosing a Course of Action  

After the problem has been identified, a pilot must evaluate  the need to react to it and determine the actions to take to  resolve the situation in the time available. The expected  outcome of each possible action should be considered and  the risks assessed before a pilot decides on a response to  the situation.  

The pilot’s first thought was to pull up on the collective and  pull back on the cyclic. After weighing the consequences of  possibly losing rotor revolutions per minute (rpm) and not  being able to maintain the climb rate sufficiently to clear the  canyon wall, which was then only a hundred yards away, she  realized the only course was to try to turn back to the landing  zone on the canyon floor.  

# Implementing the Decision and Evaluating the  Outcome  

Although a decision may be reached and a course of action  implemented, the decision-making process is not complete.  It is important to think ahead and determine how the  decision could affect other phases of the flight. As the flight  progresses, a pilot must continue to evaluate the outcome of  the decision to ensure that it is producing the desired result.  

As the pilot made the turn to the downwind, the airspeed  dropped nearly to zero, and the helicopter became very  difficult to control. (At this point, the pilot must increase  airspeed in order to maintain translational lift.) Since the  CG was aft of limits, she needed to apply more forward  cyclic than usual. As she approached the landing zone  with a high rate of descent, she realized that she would  be in a potential vortex ring state situation if she tried to  trade airspeed for altitude and lost effective translational  lift (ETL). Therefore, it did not appear that she would be  able to terminate the approach in a hover. The pilot decided  to make the shallowest approach possible and perform a  run-on landing.  

Pilots sometimes have trouble not because of deficient basic  skills or system knowledge, but because of faulty decision- making skills. Although aeronautical decisions may appear  to be simple or routine, each individual decision in aviation  often defines the options available for the next decision the  pilot must make, and the options (good or bad) it provides.  

Therefore, a poor decision early in a flight can compromise  the safety of the flight at a later time. It is important to make  appropriate and decisive choices because good decision- making early in an emergency provide greater latitude for  later options.  

# Decision-Making Models  

The decision-making process normally consists of several  steps before a pilot chooses a course of action. A variety  of structured frameworks for decision-making provide  assistance in organizing the decision process. These models  include but are not limited to the 5P (Plan, Plane, Pilot,  Passengers, Programming), the OODA Loop (Observation,  Orientation, Decision, Action), and the DECIDE (Detect,  Estimate, Choose, Identify, Do, and Evaluate) models.  [Figure   $_{I3-2J}$   All these models and their variations are  discussed in detail in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge section covering aeronautical decision-making.  

Whichever model is used, the pilot learns how to define  the problem, choose a course of action, implement the  decision, and evaluate the outcome. Remember, there is  no one right answer in this process: a pilot analyzes the  situation in light of experience level, personal minimums,  and current physical and mental readiness levels, and then  makes a decision.

Figure 13-2.  Various models of decision-making are used in problem solving.  

# Pilot Self-Assessment  

The pilot in command (PIC) of an aircraft is directly  responsible for and is the final authority for the operation  of that aircraft. The list of PIC responsibilities is long,  and nothing should be overlooked. To exercise those  responsibilities effectively and make effective decisions  regarding the outcome of a flight, a pilot must have an  understanding of personal limitations. Pilot performance from  planning the flight to execution of the flight is affected by  many factors, such as health, experience, knowledge, skill  level, and attitude.  

Exercising good judgment begins prior to taking the controls  of an aircraft. Often, pilots thoroughly check their aircraft  to determine airworthiness, yet do not evaluate their own  fitness for flight. Just as a checklist is used when preflighting  an aircraft, a personal checklist based on such factors as  experience, currency, and comfort level can help determine  if a pilot is prepared for a particular flight. Specifying when  refresher training should be accomplished and designating  weather minimums, which may be higher than those listed in  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91,  are elements that may be included on a personal checklist. Over  confidence can kill just as fast as inexperience. In addition to a  review of personal limitations, a pilot should use the I’M SAFE  checklist to further evaluate fitness for flight.  [Figure 13-3]  

# Curiosity: Healthy or Harmful?  

The roots of aviation are firmly based on curiosity. Where  would we be today had it not been for the dreams of  Leonardo da Vinci, the Wright Brothers, and Igor Sikorsky?  They all were infatuated with flight, a curiosity that led to  the origins of aviation. The tale of aviation is full of firsts:  first flight, first helicopter, first trans-Atlantic flight, and so  on. But, along the way there were many setbacks, fatalities,  and lessons learned.  

![](images/4610f1f182d6c776a9fd65e5f8fcae863aa7e6b316681201dfd67b6d2f6dba7c.jpg)  
Figure 13-3.  I’M SAFE checklist.  

Today, we continue to learn and investigate the limits  of aviation. We’ve been to the moon, and soon beyond.  Our curiosity will continue to drive us to search for the  next challenge.  

However, curiosity can also have catastrophic consequences.  Despite over 100 years of aviation practice, we still see  accidents that are caused by impaired judgment formed  from curious behavior. Pilots commonly seek to determine  the limits of their ability as well as the limits of the aircraft.  Unfortunately, too often this leads to mishaps with deadly  results. Inquisitive behavior must be harnessed and displayed  within personal and material limits.  

Deadly curiosity may not seem as obvious to some as it is to  others. Simple thoughts such as, “Is visibility really as bad  as what the ATIS is reporting?” or “Will the 20-minute fuel  light really indicate only 20 minutes worth of fuel?” can lead  to poor decisions and disastrous outcomes.  

Some aviators blatantly violate rules and aircraft limitations  without thinking through the consequences. “What  indications and change in flight characteristics will I see if  I fly this helicopter above its maximum gross weight?” or  “I’ve heard this helicopter can do aerobatic flight. Why is it  prohibited?” are examples of extremely harmful curiosity.  Even more astounding is their ignoring to the fact that the  damage potentially done to the aircraft will probably manifest  later in the aircraft’s life, affecting other crews. Spontaneous  excursions in aviation can be deadly.  

Curiosity is natural and promotes learning. Airmen should  abide by established procedures until proper and complete  hazard assessment and risk management can be completed.  

# The PAVE Checklist  

As found in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge, the FAA has designed a personal minimums  checklist. To help pilots with self-assessment, which in turn  helps mitigate risk, the acronym PAVE divides the risks of  flight into four categories. For each category, think of the  applicability specific to helicopter operations:  

•	 Pilot (pilot in command) -	 Physical, emotional readiness. -	 Flight experience, recency, currency, total time  in type. •	 Aircraft -	 Is the helicopter capable of performing the task? -	 Can it carry the necessary fuel?  

-	 Does it provide adequate power margins for the  task to be accomplished? -	 Can it carry the weight and remain within CG? -	 Will there be external loads? Environment -	 Helicopters are susceptible to the impact of  changing weather conditions.  -	 How will the change in moderating temperatures  and DA affect performance? -	 Will controllability be jeopardized by winds,  terrain, and turbulence? External pressures -	 Do not let the notion to accomplish “the mission”  override good judgment and safety. -	 Many jobs include time lines. How often do we  hear “time is money” or “time is wasting”? Don’t  sacrifice safety for an implied or actual need to  meet the deadline! -	 Do not allow yourself to feel pressured by  coworkers, family events, or friends.  

Incorporated into preflight planning, the PAVE checklist  provides the pilot with a simple way to remember each  category to examine for risk prior to each flight. Once the  pilot identifies the risks of a flight, he or she needs to decide  whether the risk or combination of risks can be managed  safely and successfully. Remember, the PIC is responsible  for deciding about canceling the flight. If the pilot decides to  continue with the flight, he or she should develop strategies  to mitigate the risks.  

One way to control risk is by setting personal minimums  for items in each risk category. Remember, these are limits  unique to an individual pilot’s current level of experience and  proficiency. They should be reevaluated periodically based  upon experience and proficiency.  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management  

Many of the concepts utilized in CRM have been successfully  applied to single-pilot operations which led to the development  of SRM. Defined as the art and science of managing all the  resources (both on board the aircraft and from outside  resources) available to a single pilot (prior to and during  flight), SRM helps to ensure the successful outcome of the  flight. As mentioned earlier, this includes risk management,  situational awareness (SA), and CFIT awareness.  

SRM training helps the pilot maintain SA by managing  automation, associated control, and navigation tasks. This  enables the pilot to accurately assess hazards, manage  resulting risk potential, and make good decisions.  

To make informed decisions during flight operations, a pilot  must be aware of the resources found both inside and outside  the cockpit. Since useful tools and sources of information  may not always be readily apparent, learning to recognize  these resources is an essential part of SRM training. The pilot  must not only identify the available resources, but he or she  must also assess whether sufficient time is available to use  a particular one, and the impact its use will have upon the  safety of the flight.  

If a pilot is flying alone into a confined area with no wind  sock or access to a current wind report, should that pilot pick  an approach path based on the direction of wind information  received from an earlier weather brief? Making an approach  into a confined area with a tailwind is a bad decision and can  be avoided. Prior to landing, the pilot should use outside  resources such a smoke, trees, and water on a pond to help  him or her accurately determine which direction the winds are  coming from. Pilots should never leave flying up to chance  and hope for the best. Many accidents could and should be  avoided by simply using the resources, internal and external  that are available.  

Internal resources are found in the cockpit during flight. Since  some of the most valuable internal resources are ingenuity,  knowledge, and skill, a pilot can expand cockpit resources  immensely by improving these capabilities. This can be  accomplished by frequently reviewing flight information  publications, such as 14 CFR and the AIM, as well as by  pursuing additional training.  

No other internal resource is more important than the pilot’s  own ability to control the situation, thereby controlling the  aircraft. Helicopter pilots quickly learn that it is not possible  to hover, single pilot, and pick up the checklist, a chart, or  publication without endangering themselves, the aircraft, or  those nearby.  

Checklists are essential cockpit resources used to verify  the aircraft instruments and systems are checked, set, and  operating properly. They also ensure proper procedures  are performed if there is a system malfunction or inflight  emergency. Pilots at all levels of experience refer to  checklists. The more advanced the aircraft is, the more crucial  checklists are.  

Therefore, have a plan on how to use the checklist (and other  necessary publications) before you begin the flight. Always  control the helicopter first. When hovering in an airport  environment, the pilot can always land the aircraft to access  the checklist or a publication, or have a passenger assist with  holding items. There is nothing more unsettling than being in  flight and not having a well thought-out plan for managing  the necessary documents and data. This lack of planning  often leads to confusion, distractions and aircraft mishaps.  

Another way to avoid a potentially complex and confusing  situation is to remove yourself from the situation. The  following is an example of how proper resource management  and removal from a situation are vital to safe flight.  

A single pilot is conducting a helicopter cross-country flight.  He frequently goes to and is familiar with the final destination  airport. Weather is briefed to be well above the minimum  weather needed, but with isolated thunderstorms possible.  For the pilot, this is a routine run-of-the-mill flight. He has  done this many times before and has memorized the route,  checkpoints, frequencies, fuel required and knows exactly  what to expect.  

However, once within 30 miles of the destination airport  the pilot observes that weather is deteriorating, and a  thunderstorm is nearby. The pilot assesses the situation and  determines the best course of action is to reroute to another  airport. The closest airport is an airport within Class C  airspace. At this point, the pilot realizes the publications with  the required alternate airport information are in the back of  the helicopter out of reach. Now what?  

The pilot continues toward the alternate airport while  using the onboard equipment to access the information.  He struggles to obtain the information because he or she  is not thoroughly familiar with its operation. Finally, the  information is acquired and the pilot dials in the appropriate  alternate airfield information. Upon initial contact ARTCC  (Air Route Traffic Control Center) notifies the pilot that he  has entered the airspace without the required clearance; in  effect the pilot has violated airspace regulations.  

Things have gone from bad to worse for him. When did the  trouble begin for this pilot and what options were available?  Without a doubt, problems began during the planning phase, as  the necessary resources were placed in the back of the aircraft,  unavailable to the pilot during flight. Additional training with  the available automated systems installed on the helicopter  would have expedited access to the necessary information.  What if they hadn’t been installed or were inoperative?  

Next, a poor decision to continue towards the Class C airspace  was made. The pilot could have turned away from the Class  C airspace, removing himself from the situation until the  frequencies were entered and contact established. Remember,  when possible, choose an option that gives more time to  determine a course of action. Proper resource management  could have negated this airspace violation.  

The example also demonstrates the need to have a thorough  understanding of all the equipment and systems in the  aircraft. As is often the case, the technology available today  is seldom used to its maximum capability. It is necessary to  become as familiar as possible with this equipment to utilize  all resources fully. For example, advanced navigation and  autopilot systems are valuable resources. However, if pilots  do not fully understand how to use this equipment, or they  rely on it so much they become complacent, the equipment  can become a detriment to safe flight.  

Another internal resource is the Rotorcraft Flight Manual  (RFM).  [Figure 13-4]  The RFM:  

•	 Must be on board the aircraft.  •	 Is indispensable for accurate flight planning. •	 Plays a vital role in the resolution of inflight equipment  malfunctions.  

Other valuable flight deck resources include current  aeronautical charts and publications, such as the Airport/ Facility Directory (A/FD).  

As stated previously, passengers can also be a valuable  resource. Passengers can help watch for traffic and may be  able to provide information in an irregular situation, especially  if they are familiar with flying. Crew briefs to passengers  should always include some basic helicopter terminology. For  example, explain that in the event you ask them if you are clear  to hover to the right, their response should be either “yes, you  are clear to hover to the right” or “no you are not clear.” A  simple yes or no answer can be ambiguous. A strange smell  or sound may alert a passenger to a potential problem. As PIC,  a pilot should brief passengers before the flight to make sure  that they are comfortable voicing any concerns.  

![](images/32d7c71a6b586d10bc11d9e2c58650e6e2ac25e93cc95a4bf5e9c6843467bc2f.jpg)  
Figure 13-4.  Rotorcraft Flying Manual (RFM).  

Instruction that integrates Single-Pilot Resource Management  into flight training teaches aspiring pilots how to be more  aware of potential risks in flying, how to identify those  risks clearly, and how to manage them successfully. The  importance of integrating available resources and learning  effective SRM skills cannot be overemphasized. Ignoring  safety issues can have fatal results.  

# Risk Management  

Risk management is a formalized way of dealing with  hazards. It is the logical process of weighing the potential  cost of risks from hazards against the possible benefits of  allowing those risks from hazards to stand unmitigated. It  is a decision-making process designed to identify hazards  systematically, assess the degree of risk, and determine the  best course of action. Once risks are identified, they must be  assessed. The risk assessment determines the degree of risk  (negligible, low, medium, or high) and whether the degree  of risk is worth the outcome of the planned activity. If the  degree of risk is “acceptable,” the planned activity may  then be undertaken. Once the planned activity is started,  consideration must then be given whether to continue. Pilots  must have preplanned, viable alternatives available in the  event the original flight cannot be accomplished as planned.  

Two defining elements of risk management are hazard and risk.  

•	 A hazard is a present condition, event, object, or  circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an  unplanned or undesired event, such as an accident.  It is a source of danger. For example, binding in the  antitorque pedals represents a hazard.  

•	 Risk is the future impact of a hazard that is not  

controlled or eliminated. It is the possibility of loss  or injury. The level of risk is measured by the number  of people or resources affected (exposure), the extent  of possible loss (severity), and the likelihood of  loss (probability).  

A hazard can be a real or perceived condition, event, or  circumstance that a pilot encounters. Learning how to identify  hazards, assess the degree of risk they pose, and determine the  best course of action is an important element of a safe flight.  

# Four Risk Elements  

During each flight, decisions must be made regarding events  that involve interactions between the four risk elements—the  PIC, the aircraft, the environment, and the operation. The  decision-making process involves an evaluation of each of  these risk elements to achieve an accurate perception of the  flight situation.  [Figure 13-5]  

One of the most important decisions that a PIC must make is  the go/no-go decision. Evaluating each of these risk elements  can help a pilot decide whether a flight should be conducted  or continued. In the following situations, the four risk  elements and how they affect decision-making are evaluated.  

Pilot—A pilot must continually make decisions about  personal competency, condition of health, mental and  emotional state, level of fatigue, and many other variables.  A situation to consider: a pilot is called early in the morning  to make a long flight. With only a few hours of sleep and  congestion that indicates the possible onset of a cold, is  that pilot safe to fly?  

Aircraft—A pilot frequently bases decisions to fly on  

![](images/5dd5d59ebb40ecb41055c93c47a4f22b40dd4ca7d71bfec42025ef6963c7d4dc.jpg)  
Figure 13-5.  Risk elements to evaluate in decision-making.  

personal evaluations of the aircraft, such as its powerplant,  performance, equipment, fuel state, or airworthiness. A  situation to consider: en route to an oil rig an hour’s flight  from shore, having just passed the shoreline, the pilot notices  the oil temperature at the high end of the caution range.  Should the pilot continue out to sea or return to the nearest  suitable heliport/airport?  

Environment—This encompasses many elements unrelated  to the pilot or aircraft. It can include such factors as weather,  ATC, navigational aids (NAVAID), terrain, takeoff and  landing areas, and surrounding obstacles. Weather is one  element that can change drastically over time and distance.  A situation to consider: a pilot is ferrying a helicopter cross- country and encounters unexpected low clouds and rain in an  area of rising terrain. Does the pilot try to stay under them  and scud run, or turn around, stay in the clear, and obtain  current weather information?  

External Pressures—The interaction between the pilot,  the aircraft, and the environment is greatly influenced by  the purpose of each flight operation. A pilot must evaluate  the three previous areas to decide on the desirability of  undertaking or continuing the flight as planned. It is worth  asking why the flight is being made, how critical it is to  maintain the schedule, and if the trip is worth the risks. A  situation to consider: a pilot is tasked to take some technicians  into rugged mountains for a routine survey in marginal  weather. Would it be preferable to wait for better conditions  to ensure a safe flight? How would the priorities change if a  pilot were tasked to search for cross-country skiers who had  become lost in deep snow and radioed for help?  

# Assessing Risk  

It is important for a pilot to learn how to assess risk. Before a  pilot can begin to assess risk, he or she must first perceive the  hazard and attendant risk(s). In aviation, experience, training,  and education help a pilot learn how to spot hazards quickly  and accurately. During flight training, the instructor should  point out the hazards and attendant risks to help the student  pilot learn to recognize them.  

Once a hazard is identified, determining the probability  and severity of an accident (level of risk associated with it)  becomes the next step. For example, the hazard of binding  in the antitorque pedals poses a risk only if the helicopter is  flown. If the binding leads to a loss of directional control,  the risk is high that it could cause catastrophic damage  to the helicopter and the passengers. The pilot learns to  identify hazards and how to deal with them when they are  incorporated into the training program.  

Every flight has hazards and some level of risk associated  with it. It is critical that pilots be able to:  

•	 Differentiate, in advance, between a low-risk flight  and a high-risk flight. •	 Establish a review process and develop risk mitigation  strategies to address flights throughout that range.  

Examining NTSB reports and other accident research can  help a pilot to assess risk more effectively. For example,  the accident rate decreases by nearly 50 percent once a  pilot obtains 100 hours and continues to decrease until the  1,000-hour level. The data suggest that for the first 500  hours, pilots flying visual flight rules (VFR) at night should  establish higher personal limitations than are required by the  regulations and, if applicable, apply instrument flying skills  in this environment.  

Individuals training to be helicopter pilots should remember  that the helicopter accident rate is 30 percent higher than the  accident rate for fixed-wing aircraft. While many factors  contribute to this, students must recognize the small margin  of error that exists for helicopter pilots in making critical  decisions. In helicopters, certain emergency actions require  immediate action by the pilot. In the event of an engine  malfunction, failure to immediately lower the collective  results in rotor decay and failed autorotation. Fixed wing  pilots may have slightly more time to react and establish  a controllable descent. According to the General Aviation  (GA) Joint Steering Committee, the leading causes of  accidents in GA are CFIT (see p.14-15), weather, runway  incursions, pilot decision-making, and loss of control.  These causes are referred to as pilot-error, or human factors  related, accidents. CFIT, runway incursions, and loss of  control type accidents typically occur when the pilot makes  a series of bad judgments, which leads to these events. For  example, when the pilot has not adequately planned the  flight and the pilot subsequently fails to maintain adequate  situational awareness to avoid the terrain, a CFIT accident  occurs.  

While the reasons for individual helicopter incidents vary,  it can be argued that it is the helicopter’s flight mode and  operational complexity that directly contributes to each  incident. By nature of its purpose, a helicopter usually  flies closer to terrain than does a fixed-wing aircraft.  Subsequently, minimal time exists to avoid CFIT, weather  related, or loss of control type incidents that require quick  and accurate assessments. Fixed-wing aircraft normally fly  at higher altitudes and are flown from prepared surface to  prepared surface. Helicopters are often operated in smaller,  confined area-type environments and require continuous  pilot control. Helicopter pilots must be aware of what rotor  wash can do when landing to a dusty area or prior to starting  where loose debris may come in contact with the rotor blades.  

Often, the loss of control occurs when the pilot exceeds  design or established operating standards, and the resulting  situation exceeds pilot capability to handle it successfully.  The FAA generally characterizes these occurrences as  resulting from poor judgment. Likewise, most weather- related accidents are not a result of the weather per se, but  of a failure of the pilot to avoid a weather phenomenon for  which the aircraft is not equipped, or the pilot is not trained  to handle. That is, the pilot decides to fly or to continues  into conditions beyond pilot capability, an action commonly  considered to be demonstrating bad judgment.  

It cannot be emphasized enough that the helicopter’s unique  capabilities come with increased risk. Since most helicopter  operations are conducted by a single pilot, the workload is  increased greatly. Low-level maneuvering flight (a catch- all category for different types of flying close to terrain or  obstacles, such as power line patrol, wildlife control, crop  dusting, air taxiing, and maneuvering for landing after an  instrument approach), is one of the largest single categories  of fatal accidents.  

Fatal accidents that occur during approach often happen at  night or in instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions. Takeoff/ initial climb accidents are frequently due to the pilot’s lack  of awareness of the effects of density altitude on aircraft  performance or other improper takeoff planning that results  in loss of control during or shortly after takeoff. One of the  most lethal types of GA flying is attempting VFR flight into  instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Accidents  involving poor weather decision-making account for about  4 percent of the total accidents but 14 percent of the fatal  mishaps. While weather forecast information has been  gradually improving, weather should remain a high priority  for every pilot assessing risk.  

# Using the 3P Model to Form Good Safety Habits  

As discussed in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge, the Perceive, Process, Perform (3P) model helps  a pilot assess and manage risk effectively in the real world.  [Figure 13-6]  

To use this model, the pilot will:  

•	 Perceive hazards •	 Process level of risk •	 Perform risk management  

Let’s put this to use through a common scenario, involving a  common task, such as a confined area approach. As is often  the case, the continuous loop consists of several elements;  each element must be addressed through the 3P process.  

![](images/87b07c15993da43ad3fef61cea6a585fecaa7585874f7812552d93eaa937785a.jpg)  
Figure 13-6.  3P Model.  

A utility helicopter pilot receives the task of flying four  passengers into a remote area for a hunting expedition. The  passengers have picked the location where they would like  to be dropped off based on the likelihood of wildlife being  in the area. The area has steep, rugged terrain in a series of  valleys and canyons leading up to large mountains.  

Upon arrival at the location, the pilot locates a somewhat  large confined area near the base of one of the mountains.  The pilot begins the 3P process by quickly noting (or  perceiving) the hazards that affect the approach, landing,  and takeoff. Through thorough assessment the pilot takes  into consideration:  

•	 Current aircraft weight/power available, •	 Required approach angle to clear the trees for landing  in the confined area,  •	 Wind direction and velocity, •	 Limited approach and departure paths (due to  constricting terrain), •	 Escape routes should the approach need to be  terminated prior to landing, •	 Possible hazards, such as wires or structures either  around the landing site or inside of the confined area,  and •	 The condition of the terrain at the landing site. Mud,  dust, and snow can be extreme hazards if the pilot is not  properly trained to land in those particular conditions.  

The pilot reviews the 3P process for each hazard. The pilot  has perceived the risk associated for each of the bullets listed  above. Now, the pilot assesses the risk level of each and what  to do to manage or mitigate the risk.  

The aircraft weight/power risk is assessed as low. While  performing power checks, the pilot verified adequate out of  ground effect (OGE) power exists. The pilot is also aware  that, in this scenario, the departure DA (6,500 feet) is greater  than the arrival location DA (6,000 feet) and that several  hundred pounds of fuel have been burned off en route.  Furthermore, once the passengers have disembarked, more  power will be available for departure.  

The pilot estimates that the highest obstacles along the  approach path are 70–80 feet in height. With the size of the  confined area, a normal approach angle can be maintained  to clear these obstacles, giving this a low risk level. To further  mitigate this risk the pilot has selected mental checkpoints  along the approach path that will serve as go/no-go points  should the pilot feel any assessed parameter is being exceeded.  

Wind direction and velocity are assessed as a medium risk  because (for this scenario) the direction of the wind is slightly  offset from the chosen approach path, creating a   $I5{-}20^{\circ}$    crosswind with a steady 10-knot wind. The pilot also takes  into consideration that, due to the terrain, the wind direction  and velocity may change during the approach. The pilot’s  experience and awareness of the complexity of mountain flow  wind provide a management tool for risk reduction.  

From an approach and departure standpoint, the risk is  assessed to be medium. There is only one viable approach  and departure path. Given the size of the confined area  and the wind direction, the approach and departure path is  deemed acceptable.  

The pilot assigns a medium risk level to the selection of an  escape route. The pilot is aware of the constricting terrain on  either side. Although adequate area exists for maneuvering,  the pilot realizes there are physical boundaries and that  they can affect the options available should the pilot need to  conduct a go-around or abort the approach. Again, the pilot  uses mental checkpoints to ensure an early decision is made  to conduct a go-around, if needed. The selected go-around  or escape route will be in line with the selected approach/ departure path and generally into the wind.  

As you may have noticed, one identified hazard and its  correlating risk management action may have subsequent  impact on other factors. This demonstrates the need for  continuous assessment and evaluation of the impact of chosen  courses of action.  

The 3P model offers three good reasons for its use. First, it  is fairly simple to remember. Second, it offers a structured,  efficient, and systematic way to identify hazards, assess risk,  and implement effective risk controls. Third, practicing risk  management needs to be as automatic as basic aircraft control.  As is true for other flying skills, risk management thinking  habits are best developed through repetition and consistent  adherence to specific procedures.  

Once the pilot completes the 3P decision process and selects  a course of action, the process begins anew as the set of  circumstances brought about by the selected course of action  requires new analysis. Thus, the decision-making process is  a continuous loop of perceiving, processing, and performing.  

# Workload or Task Management  

One component of SRM is workload or task management.  Research shows that humans have a limited capacity for  information. Once information flow exceeds the person’s  ability to mentally process the information, any additional  information becomes unattended or displaces other tasks  and information already being processed. Once this situation  occurs, only two alternatives exist: shed the unimportant  tasks or perform all tasks at a less than optimal level. Like  an overloaded electrical circuit, either the consumption must  be reduced or a circuit failure is experienced.  

Effective workload management ensures essential operations  are accomplished by planning and then placing them in  a sequence that avoids work overload. As a pilot gains  experience, he or she learns to recognize future workload  requirements and can prepare for high workload periods  during times of low workload.  

Reviewing the appropriate chart and setting radio frequencies  well in advance of need help reduce workload as a flight  nears the airport. In addition, a pilot should listen to  Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), Automated  Surface Observing System (ASOS), or Automated Weather  Observing System (AWOS), if available, and then monitor  the tower frequency or Common Traffic Advisory Frequency  (CTAF) to get a good idea of what traffic conditions to  expect. Checklists should be performed well in advance so  there is time to focus on traffic and ATC instructions. These  procedures are especially important prior to entering a high- density traffic area, such as Class B airspace.  

To manage workload, items should be prioritized. For  example, during any situation, and especially in an  emergency, a pilot should remember the phrase “aviate,  navigate, and communicate.” This means that the first  thing a pilot should do is make sure the helicopter is under  control, then begin flying to an acceptable landing area.  Only after the first two items are assured should a pilot try  to communicate with anyone.  

Another important part of managing workload is recognizing  a work overload situation. The first effect of high workload  is that a pilot begins to work faster. As workload increases,  attention cannot be devoted to several tasks at one time, and  a pilot may begin to focus on one item. When a pilot becomes  task saturated, there is no awareness of additional inputs from  various sources, so decisions may be made on incomplete  information, and the possibility of error increases.  

A very good example of this is inadvertent IMC. Once entering  into bad weather, work overload can occur immediately.  Mentally, the pilot must transition from flying outside of the  aircraft to flying inside the aircraft. Losing all visual references  can cause sensory overload and the ability to think rationally  can be lost. Instead of trusting the aircraft’s instruments, pilots  may try to hang onto the few visual references that they have,  and forget all about all other factors surrounding them. Instead  of slowing the helicopter down they increase airspeed. This  can be caused by an oculogravic illusion. This type of illusion  occurs when an aircraft accelerates and decelerates. Inertia  from linear accelerations and decelerations cause the otolith  organ to sense a nose-high or nose-low attitude. Pilots falsely  perceive that the aircraft is in a nose-high attitude. Therefore,  pilots increase airspeed. Pilots can also be looking down for  visual references and forget about the hazards in front of  them. Finally, since the pilots are not looking at the flight  instruments, the aircraft is not level. All of this can be avoided  by proper training and proper planning. If going inadvertent  IMC is your only course of action, pilots must commit to it  and fly the helicopter using only the flight instruments and not  trying to follow the few visual references they have.  

When a work overload situation exists, a pilot needs to:  

•	 Stop, •	 Think, •	 Slow down, and then •	 Prioritize.  

It is important for a pilot to understand how to decrease  workload by:  

•	 Placing a situation in the proper perspective, •	 Remaining calm, and •	 Thinking rationally.  

These key elements reduce stress and increase the pilot’s  ability to fly safely. They depend upon the experience,  discipline, and training that each safe flight earns. It is  important to understand options available to decrease  workload. For example, setting a radio frequency may be  delegated to another pilot or to a passenger, freeing the pilot  to perform higher-priority tasks.  

# Situational Awareness  

In addition to learning to make good aeronautical decisions,  and learning to manage risk and flight workload, SA is an  important element of ADM. SA is the accurate perception  and understanding of all the factors and conditions within  the four fundamental risk elements (PAVE) that affect safety  before, during, and after the flight. SA involves being aware  of what is happening around you, in order to understand how  information, events, and your own actions will impact your  goals and objectives, both now and in the near future. Lacking  SA or having inadequate SA has been identified as one of  the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error.  

SA in a helicopter can be quickly lost. Understanding the  significance and impact of each risk factor independently  and cumulatively aid in safe flight operations. It is possible,  and all too likely, that we forget flying while at work. Our  occupation, or work, may be conducting long line operations,  maneuvering around city obstacles to allow a film crew  access to news events, spraying crops, ferrying passengers  or picking up a patient to be flown to a hospital. In each case  we are flying a helicopter. The moment we fail to account for  the aircraft systems, the environment, other aircraft, hazards,  and ourselves, we lose SA.  

To maintain SA, all of the skills involved in SRM are  used. For example, an accurate perception of pilot fitness  can be achieved through self-assessment and recognition  of hazardous attitudes. A clear assessment of the status of  navigation equipment can be obtained through workload  management, while establishing a productive relationship  with ATC can be accomplished by effective resource use.  

# Obstacles to Maintaining Situational Awareness  

What distractions interfere with our focus or train of thought?  There are many. A few examples pertinent to aviation, and  helicopters specifically, follow.  

Fatigue, frequently associated with pilot error, is a threat to  aviation safety because it impairs alertness and performance.  [Figure 13-7]  The term is used to describe a range of  experiences from sleepy or tired to exhausted. Two major  physiological phenomena create fatigue: circadian rhythm  disruption and sleep loss.  

Many helicopter jobs require scheduling flexibility,  frequently affecting the body’s circadian rhythm. You  

![](images/c2d5b9ba877a2a513b30eaa138c88c6248e589ea2ca6498f8852062128b22006.jpg)  
Figure 13-7. Warning signs of  fatigue  according to the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI)  

may be flying a day flight Monday and then at night on  Tuesday. Your awareness of how your body and mind  react to this variation in schedule is vital to safety. This  disruptive pattern may result in degradation of attention  and concentration, impaired coordination, and decreased  ability to communicate.  

Physical fatigue results from sleep loss, exercise, or physical  work. Factors such as stress and prolonged performance of  cognitive work result in mental fatigue. Consecutive days of  flying the maximum allowable flight time can fatigue a pilot,  mentally and physically. It is important to take breaks within  the workday, as well as days off when possible. When you find  yourself in this situation, take an objective, honest assessment  of your state of mind. If necessary, use rest periods to allow  rejuvenation of the mind and body.  [Figure 13-8]  

Fatigue also occurs under circumstances in which there is  anticipation of flight followed by inactivity. For instance,  a pilot is given a task requiring a specific takeoff time. In  anticipation of the flight, the pilot’s adrenaline kicks in and  SA is elevated. After a delay (weather, maintenance, or any  other unforeseen delay), the pilot feels a letdown, in effect,  becoming fatigued. Then, upon resuming the flight, the pilot  does not have that same level of attention.  

Complacency presents another obstacle to maintaining  SA. Defined as overconfidence from repeated experience  with a specific activity, complacency has been implicated  as a contributing factor in numerous aviation accidents  and incidents. When activities become routine, a pilot may  have a tendency to relax and not put as much effort into  performance. Like fatigue, complacency reduces a pilot’s  effectiveness on the flight deck. However, complacency is  more difficult to recognize than fatigue, since everything  seems to be progressing smoothly.  

Since complacency seems to creep into our routine without  notice, ask what has changed. The minor changes that go  unnoticed can be associated with the four fundamental risks  we previously discussed: pilot, aircraft, environment, and  external pressures.  

As a pilot, am I still using checklists or have I become reliant  on memory to complete my checks? Do I check (Notices to  Airmen) NOTAMs before every flight or only when I think  it is necessary? And the aircraft: did I feel that vibration  before or is it new? Was there a log book entry for it? If so,  

![](images/549c63d722f9706d1a104bbae51210856f3187e1a645d88ef2a071987295eb56.jpg)  
Figure 13-8. Countermeasures to fatigue according to the FAA  Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) .  

Complacent acceptance of common weather patterns can  have huge impacts on safety. The forecast was for clearing  after the rain shower, but what was the dew-point spread?  The winds are greater than forecast. Will this create reduced  visibility in dusty, snowy areas or exceed wind limitations?  

While conducting crop spraying, a new agent is used.  Does that change the weight? Does that change the flight  profile and, if so, what new hazards might be encountered?  When things are going smoothly, it is time to heighten your  awareness and become more attentive to your flight activities.  

Advanced avionics have created a high degree of redundancy  and dependability in modern aircraft systems, which can  promote complacency and inattention. Routine flight  operations may lead to a sense of complacency, which can  threaten flight safety by reducing SA.  

Loss of SA can be caused by a minor distraction that diverts  the pilot’s attention from monitoring the instruments or  scanning outside the aircraft. For example, a gauge that is  not reading correctly is a minor problem, but it can cause an  accident if the pilot diverts attention to the perceived problem  and neglects to control the aircraft properly.  

# Operational Pitfalls  

There are numerous common behavioral traps that can  ensnare the unwary pilot. Pilots, particularly those with  considerable experience, try to complete a flight as planned,  please passengers, and meet schedules. This basic drive to  achieve can have an adverse effect on safety and can impose  an unrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful  conditions. These tendencies ultimately may bring about  practices that are dangerous and sometimes illegal and may  lead to a mishap. Pilots develop awareness and learn to avoid  many of these operational pitfalls through effective SRM  training.  [Figure 13-9]  

# Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT)  Awareness  

An emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter departed  for a night flight to transport an 11-day-old infant patient  from one hospital to another. No record was found indicating  the pilot obtained a weather briefing before departure. The  pilot had a choice of taking either a direct route that crossed  a remote area of rugged mountainous terrain with maximum  ground elevations of about 9,000 feet or a route that was  about 10 minutes longer and followed an interstate highway  with maximum ground elevations of about 6,000 feet. Radar  data, which show about 4 minutes of the helicopter’s flight  before coverage was lost due to mountainous terrain, are  A search was initiated about 4 hours after the helicopter did  not arrive at the destination hospital, and the wreckage was  located the following morning. Physical evidence observed  at the accident site indicated that the helicopter was in level  flight at impact and was consistent with CFIT. [Figure 13-10]  

CFIT is a type of accident that continues to be a major safety  concern, while at the same time difficult to explain because  it involves a pilot controlling an airworthy aircraft that is  flown into terrain (water or obstacles) with inadequate pilot  awareness of the impending disaster.  

One constant in CFIT accidents is that outside visibility is  limited, or the accident occurs at night and the terrain is not  seen easily until just prior to impact. Another commonality  among CFIT accidents is lack of SA. This includes not only  horizontal awareness, and knowing where the helicopter is  over the ground, but also vertical awareness.  

Training, planning, and preparation are a pilot’s best defenses  for avoiding CFIT accidents. For example, take some time  before takeoff to become familiar with the proposed flight and  the terrain. Avoidance of CFIT begins before the helicopter  departs the home location. Proper planning, including applied  risk mitigation must occur before the aircraft is even started.  Thorough assessment of terrain, visibility, pilot experience  and available contingencies must be conducted. If necessary,  delay or postpone the flight while on the ground. The decision  to abort the flight is much easier to make in the planning room  than in the air. In case conditions deteriorate once in flight.  Have contingency options available.  

While many CFIT accidents and incidents occur during  nonprecision approaches and landings, great measures have  been taken to improve instrument training, equipment and  procedures. For the qualified pilot, instrument flight should  not be avoided, but rather, trained as a viable option for safely  recovering the aircraft. Like any other training, frequent  instrument training builds confidence and reassurance.  

Good instrument procedures include studying approach  charts before leaving cruise altitude. Key fixes and airport  elevation must be noted and associated with terrain and  obstacles along the approach path. Pilots should have a good  understanding of both approach and departure design criteria  to understand fully the obstacle clearance margins built into  them. Some pilots have the false belief that ATC provides  obstacle clearance while en route off airways. The pilot is  ultimately responsible for obstacle clearance.  

# Operational Pitfalls  

Peer Pressure  

It would be foolish and unsafe for a new pilot to attempt to compete with an older, more experienced pilot. The only safe competition  should be completing the most safe flights with no one endangered or hurt and the aircraft returned to service. Efficiency comes with  experience and on-the-job training.  

Mindset A pilot should be taught to approach every day as something new.  

Get-There-Itis  

This disposition impairs pilot judgment through a fixation on the original goal or destination, combined with a disregard for any  alternative course of action.  

Duck-Under Syndrome  

A pilot may be tempted to arrive at an airport by descending below minimums during an approach. There may be a belief that  there is a built-in margin of error in every approach procedure, or the pilot may not want to admit that the landing cannot be  completed and a missed approach must be initiated.  

Scud Running It is difficult for a pilot to estimate the distance from indistinct forms, such as clouds or fog formation.  

Continuing Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Into Instrument Conditions Spatial disorientation or collision with ground/obstacles may occur when a pilot continues VFR into instrument conditions. This can  be even more dangerous if the pilot is not instrument rated or current.  

# Getting Behind the Aircraft  

This pitfall can be caused by allowing events or the situation to control pilot actions. A constant state of surprise at what happens  next may be exhibited when the pilot is “getting behind” the aircraft.  

# Loss of Positional or Situational Awareness  

In extreme cases of a pilot getting behind the aircraft, a loss of positional or situational awareness may result. The pilot may not  know the aircraft’s geographical location, or may be unable to recognize deteriorating circumstances.  

# Operating Without Adequate Fuel Reserves  

Pilots should use the last of the known fuel to make a safe landing. Bringing fuel to an aircraft is much less inconvenient than  picking up the pieces of a crashed helicopter! Pilots should land prior to whenever their watch, fuel gauge, low-fuel warning system,  or flight planning indicates fuel burnout. They should always be thinking of unforecast winds, richer-than-planned mixtures,  unknown leaks, mis-servicing, and errors in planning. Newer pilots need to be wary of fuselage attitudes in low-fuel situations.  Some helicopters can port air into the fuel system in low-fuel states, causing the engines to quit or surge.  

Descent Below the Minimum En Route Altitude The duck-under syndrome, as mentioned above, can also occur during the en route portion of an IFR flight.  

Flying Outside the Envelope The pilot must understand how to check the charts, understand the results, and fly accordingly.  

Neglect of Flight Planning, Preflight Inspections, and Checklists All pilots and operators must understand the complexity of the helicopter, the amazing number of parts, and why there are service  times associated with certain parts. Pilots should understand material fatigue and maintenance requirements. Helicopters are  unforgiving of disregarded maintenance requirements. Inspections and maintenance are in place for safety: something functioning  improperly can be the first link in the error chain to an accident. In some cases, proper maintenance is a necessary condition for  insurance converage.  

Figure 13-9.  Operational pitfalls.  

Altitude error is another common cause of CFIT. Cases  of altitude error involve disorientation with respect to the  NAVAID, improper transition on approach, selecting the  wrong NAVAID, or just plain lack of horizontal SA. Today’s  modern aircraft have sophisticated flight directors, autopilots,  autothrottles, and flight management systems. These devices  make significant contributions to the overall safety of flight,  but they are only machines that follow instructions. They  do whatever is asked of them, even if it is wrong. When  commanded, they unerringly follow instructions—sometimes  straight into the ground. The pilot must ensure that both  vertical and horizontal modes are correct and engaged. Cross- check autopilots constantly.  

![](images/c8d127bddf7afdab5e3ce9323ee2be5f1867909dd5af15cebe0781f11df772b1.jpg)  
Figure 13-10.  Helicopter heading straight for mountain.  

When automated flight equipment is not available, great  care must be taken to prepare properly for a night flight.  SRM becomes more challenging under the cover of  darkness, and caution should be exercised when determining  what artificial light source to use inside the aircraft. A light  source that is too bright will blind the pilot from seeing  outside obstacles or rising terrain. Certain colored lenses  bleach out symbols and markings on a map. Conduct this  planning on the ground, in a dark room if necessary, before  the actual flight.  

Pilots must be even more conservative with their decision- making and planning when flying at night. Flying becomes  more difficult due to the degradation of our sensory perception  and the lack of outside references. Beginning with preflight,  looking over the helicopter with a flashlight can cause pilots  to miss even the smallest discrepancy that they would easily  see during the day. For example, failing to remove one or all  of the tie downs and attempting to take off would probably  result in a dynamic rollover accident. Whenever possible,  preflight inspection should always be conducted during the  day or in a lighted hangar. Depth perception is less acute;  therefore, hover height should be increased to avoid contact  with obstacles and hover speed should be reduced. Weather  conditions can be very deceptive and difficult to detect in  flight under night conditions. On a low-illumination night,  it is easy to fly into clouds without realizing it before it is  too late to correct.  

Due to the number of recent CFIT night accidents, the NTSB  issued a safety alert in 2008 about avoiding night CFIT  accidents. That alert included the following information:  

•	 Terrain familiarization is critical to safe visual  operations at night. Use sectional charts or other  topographic references to ensure the helicopter will  safely clear terrain and obstructions all along the route.  •	 When planning a nighttime VFR flight, follow IFR  practices, such as climbing on a known safe course  

altitude that provides terrain separation similar to IFR  flights (2,000 feet above ground level in mountainous  areas and 1,000 feet above the ground in other areas).  Using this technique, known obstacles, such as towers,  will be avoided. •	 When receiving radar services, do not depend on ATC  to warn of terrain hazards. Although controllers try  to warn pilots if they notice a hazardous situation,  they may not always recognize that a particular VFR  aircraft is dangerously close to terrain.  •	 When ATC issues a heading with an instruction to  “maintain VFR,” be aware that the heading may  not provide adequate terrain clearance. If any doubt  exists about your ability to avoid terrain and obstacles  visually, advise ATC immediately and take action to  reach a safe altitude.  •	 For improved night vision, the FAA recommends the  use of supplemental oxygen for flights above 5,000 feet. •	 Obtain as much information about areas in which you  will be flying, and the routes to them, by utilizing  hazard maps and satellite imagery.  •	 Before flying at night to unfamiliar remote areas or  areas with hazardous terrain, try to arrange a day flight  for familiarization.  •	 If a pilot flies at night, especially in remote or unlit  areas, consider whether a global positioning system  (GPS)-based terrain awareness unit would improve  the safety of the flight.  

Of particular note in the 2008 safety alert is a comment  regarding oxygen use above 5,000 feet. Most helicopters  are neither required nor equipped for supplemental oxygen  use at this altitude. Due to the physiological effect on night  vision of reduced available oxygen at higher elevations, care  should be taken to exercise light discipline. Interior lighting  should be lowered to the lowest possible levels but must allow  adequate illumination of necessary systems and instruments.  This, in turn, allows greater recognition of outside obstacles  and terrain features.  

Limited outside visibility is one constant in CFIT accidents.  In the accident cited at the beginning of this section, it  appears the pilot failed to obtain a weather briefing. If the  pilot had obtained one, he would probably have learned  of the cloud cover and light precipitation present along  his planned route of flight. The limited outside visibility  probably caused the CFIT accident, since no evidence was  found of any pre-impact mechanical discrepancies with the  helicopter’s airframe or systems that would have prevented  

# Automation Management  

Automation management is the control and navigation of an  aircraft by means of the automated systems installed in the  aircraft. One of the most important concepts of automation  management is simply knowing when to use it and when not to.  

Ideally, a pilot first learns to perform practical test standard  (PTS) maneuvers and procedures in the aircraft manually,  or hand flying. After successfully demonstrating proficiency  in the basic maneuvers, the pilot is then introduced to the  available automation and/or the autopilot. Obviously, in some  aircraft, not all automated systems may be disengaged for  basic flight. The purpose of basic flight without automation is  to ensure the pilot can hand fly the maneuver when necessary.  

Advanced avionics offer multiple levels of automation, from  strictly manual flight to highly automated flight. No one level  of automation is appropriate for all flight situations, but to  avoid potentially dangerous distractions when flying with  advanced avionics, the pilot must know how to manage the  course indicator, the navigation source, and the autopilot.  It is important for a pilot to know the peculiarities of the  particular automated system in use. This ensures the pilot  knows what to expect, how to monitor for proper operation,  and promptly take appropriate action if the system does not  perform as expected.  

At the most basic level, managing the autopilot means  knowing at all times which modes are engaged and which  modes are armed to engage. The pilot needs to verify that  armed functions (e.g., navigation tracking or altitude capture)  engage at the appropriate time. Automation management is a  good place to practice the callout technique, especially after  arming the system to make a change in course or altitude.  Callouts are verbalizations of particular flight guidance  automation mode changes. In an attempt to reduce the risk  for mode confusion some operators have required flight  crews to callout all flight guidance automation mode changes  as a means of forcing pilots to monitor the Flight Mode  Annunciator (FMA).  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter focused on aeronautical decision-making,  which includes SRM training, risk management, workload  or task management, SA, CFIT awareness, and automation  management. Factors affecting a helicopter pilot’s ability to  make safe aeronautical decisions were also discussed. The  importance of learning how to be aware of potential risks in  flying, how to clearly identify those risks, and how to manage  them successfully were also explored.
