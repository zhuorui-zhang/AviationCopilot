# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Preface  

Designed   for   ground   instructors,   flight   instructors,   and   aviation   maintenance   instructors,   the   Aviation   Instructor’s   Handbook   was  developed by the Flight Standards Service, Airman Testing Standards Branch, in cooperation with aviation educators and industry to  help beginning instructors understand and apply the fundamentals of instruction. This handbook provides aviation instructors with up­ to-date information on learning and teaching, and how to relate this information to the task of teaching aeronautical knowledge and  skills to learners. Experienced aviation instructors will also find the updated information useful for improving their effectiveness in  training activities.

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 1: Risk Management and Single-Pilot Resource Management  

# Introduction  

“Pull the throttle back!” Lenore, a  f light  instructor , ordered the learner, Jennifer, as the revolutions per minute  (rpm) climbed past   past 2,000 on engine start. “I did, I did!”  

Both Jennifer and Lenore grabbed the mixture and pulled. The engine went from a deafening roar to silence. They looked at each  other. “What happened?” asked Jennifer. “I don’t know. Let’s check the engine,” Lenore said.  

Ten minutes later, they had removed the cowling from the airplane. A quick engine check gave them the answer. The throttle rod-end  was not connected to the carburetor arm—no bolt, no nut, just air between the rod-end and the arm. Jennifer looked at Lenore. “What  if this had happened in flight?”  

“What I want to know,” Lenore said, “is how this happened at all. The annual inspection was signed off yesterday.”  

The previous day, the annual inspection had been signed off after a lengthy inspection by a local facility. Several mechanics had been  involved in the inspection, including the owner/learner who had installed a headliner. The mechanic with the Inspection Authorization  (IA) who signed off the annual was supervising several annuals, so most of the maintenance was performed by other mechanics.  

After the inspection, the engine had been run-up according to the usual post-inspection procedures. The learner and instructor had  flown the airplane for a half-hour   familiarization   flight.   The   next   day’s   engine   start   resulted   in   a runaway   engine   with   the   apparent  cause due to the lack of the throttle rod-end hardware being safetied.  

Three deficient areas in this annual inspection were identified by a round-table discussion group of aircraft and powerplant (A&P)  mechanics and the learner. These areas were:  

⦁  Lack of responsibility  ⦁  Checklist misuse  ⦁  Complacency  

Lack of responsibility—no one took responsibility for the entire inspection. The chances of something being overlooked increase with  an increase in the number of mechanics involved in an inspection. The responsible person is removed from the actual procedure. The  learner remembers hearing the IA ask one of the engine mechanics about the throttle. However, the question was vague, the answer  was vague, and the rod-end was not safetied.  

Checklist misuse—Perhaps the throttle rod-end had been disconnected for maintenance after the IA had signed off the  control inspection and marked that item as complete on the maintenan c e checklist. In that case, a discrepancy should have been entered onto the discrepancy sheet stating, “reconnect and safety throttle rod-end.”  

Complacency—an insidious and hard-to-identify attitude. Each of the mechanics involved in the incident thought someone else had  inspected the throttle rod-end. The IA signed off the annual inspection after asking the mechanics about the items on the checklist,  making frequent visits to the airplane, inspecting some of the various items, and deciding that was good enough. Complacency  crippled the mechanics’   quality of work by removing any thoughts of double-checking each other’s work.  

While a definite answer to the question of what happened remains a matter of speculation, professional mechanics heed warning signs  of potential problems. The combination of a lengthy inspection, numerous technicians, an overworked supervisor, a poor checklist,  and vague communication raise a red flag of caution.  

This scenario underscores the need for safety risk management at all levels of aviation. Safety risk management, a formal system of  hazard identification, assessment, and mitigation, is essential in keeping risk at acceptable levels. Part of this process is selecting the  appropriate controls to mitigate the risk of the identified hazard. The primary objective of risk management is accident prevention,  which is achieved by proactively identifying, assessing, and eliminating or mitigating safety-related hazards to acceptable levels.  

This chapter discusses safety risk management in the aviation community, looking at it as preemptive, rather than reactive. The  principles of risk management and the tools for teaching risk management in the flight training environment are addressed in Chapter  9, Techniques of Flight Instruction.  

# Defining Risk Management  

Risk is defined as the probability and possible severity of accident or loss from exposure to various hazards, including injury to  people and loss of resources.  [Figure 1-1]  All Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operations in the United States involve risk  and benefit from decisions that include risk assessment and risk management. Risk management, a formalized way of thinking about  these topics, is the logical process of weighing the potential costs of risks against the possible benefits of allowing those risks to stand  uncontrolled.  

![](images/5aad3c128704773dbda591439b823e22abc55f7340890be275a67e81f2d229b6.jpg)  

Risk management is a decision-making process designed to identify hazards systematically, assess the degree of risk, and determine  the best course of action. Key terms are:  

⦁  Hazard—a present condition, event, object, or circumstance that could lead to or contribute to an      unplanned or undesired event, such as an accident. It is a source of danger. For example, a nick in the      propeller represents a hazard.  ⦁  Risk—the future impact of a hazard that is not controlled or eliminated. It is the possibility of loss or      injury. The level of risk is measured by the number of people or resources affected (exposure); the extent      of possible loss (severity); and likelihood of loss (probability).  ⦁  Safety—freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational illness, or damage to or      loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. Note that absolute safety is not possible      because complete freedom from all hazardous conditions is not possible. Therefore, safety is a relative      term that implies a level of risk that is both perceived and accepted.  

# Principles of Risk Management  

The goal of risk management is to proactively identify safety-related hazards and mitigate the associated risks. Risk management is an  important component of decision-making. When a pilot follows good decision-making practices, the inherent risk in a flight is  reduced or even eliminated. The ability to make good decisions is based upon direct or indirect experience and education. It is  important to remember the four fundamental principles of risk management:  

# Accept No Unnecessary Risk  

Unnecessary risk is that which carries no commensurate return in terms of benefits or opportunities. Everything involves risk. The  most logical choices for accomplishing a flight are those that meet all requirements with the minimum acceptable risk. The corollary  to this axiom is “accept necessary risk” required to complete the flight or task successfully. Flying is impossible without risk,  but unnecessary risk comes without a corresponding return. If flying a new airplane for the first time, a  flight instructor   might   determine that the risk of making that flight in low instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions is unnecessary.  

# Make Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level  

Anyone can make a risk decision. However, risk decisions should be made by the person who can develop and implement risk  controls. In a single-pilot situation, the pilot makes the decision to accept certain levels of risk, so why let anyone else—such as ATC  or your passengers—make risk decisions for you? In the maintenance facility, an aviation maintenance technician (AMT) may need to  elevate decisions to the next level in the chain of management upon determining that those controls available to him or her will not  reduce residual risk to an acceptable level.  

# Accept Risk When Benefits Outweigh the Costs  

All identified benefits should be compared against all identified costs. Even high-risk endeavors may be undertaken when there is  clear knowledge that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs. For example, in any flying activity, it is necessary to accept  some degree of risk. A day with good weather, for example, is a much better time to fly an unfamiliar airplane for the first time than a  day with low instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions.  

# Integrate Risk Management into Planning at All Levels  

Risks are more easily assessed and managed in the early planning stages of a flight. Changes made later in the process of planning  and executing may become more difficult, time consuming, and expensive. However, safety enhancement occurs at any time  appropriate and effective risk management take place.  

# Risk Management Process  

Risk management is a simple process which identifies operational hazards and takes reasonable measures to reduce risk to personnel,  equipment, and the mission. During each flight, the pilot makes many decisions under hazardous conditions. To fly safely, the pilot  needs to identify the risk, assess the degree of risk, and determine the best course of action to mitigate the risk.  

# Step 1: Identify the Hazard  

A hazard is defined as any real or potential condition that can cause degradation, injury, illness, death, or damage to or loss of  equipment or property. Experience, common sense, and specific analytical tools help identify risks. Once the pilot determines that a  hazard poses a potential risk to the flight, it may be further analyzed.  

# Step 2: Assess the Risk  

Each identified risk may be assessed in terms of its likelihood (probability) and its severity (consequences) that could result from the  hazards based upon the exposure of humans or equipment to the hazards. An assessment of overall risk is then possible, typically by  using a risk assessment matrix, such an online Flight Risk Awareness Tool (FRAT). This process defines the probability and severity  of an accident.  

# Step 3: Mitigate the Risk  

Investigate specific strategies and tools that reduce, mitigate, or eliminate the risk. High risks may be mitigated by taking action to  lower likelihood and/or severity to lower levels. For serious risks, such actions may also be taken. Medium and low risks do not  normally require mitigation. Effective control measures reduce or eliminate the most critical risks. The analysis may consider the  overall costs and benefits of remedial actions, providing alternative choices when possible.  

# Implementing the Risk Management Process  

The following principles allow for maximum benefit from series of steps described above that form a risk mitigation strategy:  

⦁  Apply the steps in sequence—each step is a building block for the next and should be completed before      proceeding to the next. If a hazard identification step is interrupted to focus on the control of a      particular hazard, more important hazards may be overlooked. Until all hazards are identified, the      remainder of the process is not effective.  

⦁  Maintain a balance in the process—all steps are important. Allocate the time and resources to perform all.  

⦁  Apply the process in a cycle—the “supervise and review”   step should include a brand-new look at the      operation being analyzed to see whether new hazards can be identified.  

⦁  Involve people in the process—ensure that risk controls are mission supportive, and the people who     do the work see them as positive actions. The people who are exposed to risks usually know best     what works and what does not.  

# Identifying Risk  

Hazards and their associated risks can either be obvious or harder to detect. You should methodically identify and classify risks to a  proposed or ongoing flight by maintaining constant situational awareness. To assist this process, it is helpful to apply the simple  acronym PAVE to your risk management process. The acronym stands for Pilot, Aircraft, Environment, External pressures. Use the  following guidelines and questions to identify risk using the PAVE acronym.  

# The Pave Checklist  

By incorporating the PAVE checklist into all stages of flight planning, the pilot divides the risks of flight into four categories: Pilot in  command (PIC), Aircraft, enVironment, and External pressures (PAVE), which form part of a pilot’s decision-making process.  

With the PAVE checklist, pilots have a simple way to remember each category to examine for risk prior to each flight. Once a pilot  identifies the risks of a flight, he or she needs to decide whether the risk or combination of risks can be managed safely and  successfully. If not, the flight should be cancelled. If the pilot decides to continue with the flight, he or she should develop strategies  to mitigate the risks. One way a pilot can control the risks is to set personal minimums for items in each risk category. These are  limits   unique to   that individual pilot’s   current level of   experience   and   proficiency.  

For example, the aircraft may have a maximum crosswind component of 15 knots listed in the aircraft flight manual (AFM), and the  pilot has experience with 10 knots of direct crosswind. It could be unsafe to exceed a 10 knot-crosswind component without  additional training. Therefore, the 10 knots crosswind experience level should be that pilot’s personal limitation until additional  training with a flight instructor provides the pilot with additional experience for flying in crosswinds that exceed 10 knots.  

One of   the most important concepts   that safe pilots   understand    the difference   between   what is   “legal” in   terms   of   the regulations,  and   what is   “smart” or   “safe”    terms   of   pilot experience   and   proficiency.  

#  $P=$  Pilot in Command (PIC)  

The pilot is   one of   the risk   factors   in   a flight. When   considering   that risk,   a pilot may   ask,   “Am    ready   for   this   trip?” in   terms of  experience, currency, and physical and emotional condition. The IMSAFE checklist (described later in this chapter) combined with  proficiency, recency, and currency helps provide the answer.  

#  $A=$   Aircraft  

What limitations will the aircraft impose upon the trip? Ask the following questions:  

⦁  Is this the right aircraft for the flight?  ⦁  Am I familiar with and current in this aircraft? Aircraft performance figures and the AFM are based on a      brand-new aircraft flown by a professional test pilot. Keep that in mind while assessing personal and      aircraft performance.  ⦁  Is this aircraft equipped for the flight? Instruments? Lights? Navigation and communication equipment      adequate?  ⦁  Can this aircraft use the runways available for the trip with an adequate margin of safety under the      conditions to be flown?  ⦁  Can this aircraft carry the planned load?  ⦁  Can this aircraft operate at the altitudes needed for the trip?  ⦁  Does this aircraft have sufficient fuel capacity, with reserves, for trip legs planned?  ⦁  Does the fuel quantity delivered match the fuel quantity ordered?  

# V = EnVironment  

Weather is a major environmental consideration. Earlier it was suggested pilots set their own personal minimums, especially when it  comes to weather. As pilots evaluate the weather for a particular flight, they should consider the following:  

⦁  What are the current ceiling and visibility? In mountainous terrain, consider having higher minimums for      ceiling and visibility, particularly if the terrain is unfamiliar.  ⦁  Consider the possibility that the weather may be different than forecast. Have alternative plans and be ready      and willing to divert should an unexpected change occur.  ⦁  Consider the winds at the airports being used and the strength of the crosswind component.  ⦁  If flying in mountainous terrain, consider whether there are strong winds aloft. Strong winds in      mountainous terrain can cause severe turbulence and downdrafts and can be very hazardous for aircraft even      when there is no other significant weather.  ⦁  Are there any thunderstorms present or forecast?  ⦁  If there are clouds, is there any icing, current or forecast? What is the temperature-dew point spread and      the current temperature at altitude? Can descent be made safely all along the route?  ⦁  If   icing   conditions   are encountered,    the pilot experienced   at operating   the aircraft’s   deicing   or   anti-icing      equipment? Is this equipment in good condition and functional? For what icing conditions is the aircraft      rated, if any?  

Evaluation of terrain is another important component of analyzing the flight environment. To avoid terrain and obstacles, especially at  night or in low visibility, determine safe altitudes in advance by using the altitudes shown on VFR and IFR charts during preflight  planning. Use maximum elevation figures (MEFs) and other easily obtainable data to minimize chances of an inflight collision with  terrain or obstacles.  

Airport considerations include:  

⦁  What lights are available at the destination and alternate airports? VASI/PAPI or ILS glideslope guidance?       Is the terminal airport equipped with them? Are they working? Will the pilot need to use the radio to      activate the airport lights?  ⦁  Check the Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) for closed runways or airports. Look for runway or beacon lights      out, nearby towers, etc.  ⦁  Choose the flight route wisely. An engine failure gives the nearby airports (and terrain) supreme      importance.  ⦁  Are there shorter or obstructed fields at the destination and/or alternate airports?  

Airspace considerations include:  

⦁  If the trip is over remote areas, are appropriate clothing, water, and survival gear onboard?  ⦁  If the trip includes flying over water or unpopulated areas might  there be a loss of visual references?  ⦁  Will there be any airspace or temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) along the route of flight?  

Night flying requires special consideration:  

⦁  Will the trip include flying over water or unpopulated areas?  ⦁  Will the flight conditions allow a safe emergency landing at night?  ⦁  Are the aircraft lights found to be operational during preflight and is a flashlight available that is      appropriate for intended use before and during flight?  

$E=$  External Pressures  

External pressures are influences external to the flight that create a sense of pressure to complete a flight—often at the expense of  safety. Factors that can be external pressures include the following:  

⦁  Someone waiting   at the airport for   the flight’s   arrival.   ⦁  A passenger the pilot does not want to disappoint.  ⦁  The desire to demonstrate pilot qualifications.  ⦁  The desire    impress   someone.   (Probably   the two   most dangerous   words    aviation   are “Watch   this!”)   ⦁  The desire    satisfy   a specific personal goal (“get-home-itis,” “get-there-itis,” and   “let’s-go-itis").  ⦁  The pilot’s   general goal-completion orientation.  ⦁  Emotional pressure associated with acknowledging that skill and experience levels may be lower than a      pilot would like them to be. Pride can be a powerful external factor!  

Management of external pressure is the single most important key to risk management because it is the one risk factor category that  can cause a pilot to ignore all the other risk factors. External pressures put time-related pressure on the pilot and figure into a majority  of accidents.  

The use of personal standard operating procedures (SOPs) is one way to manage external pressures. The goal is to supply a release  for the external pressures of a flight. These procedures include but are not limited to:  

⦁  Allow time on a trip for an extra fuel stop or to make an unexpected landing because of weather.  ⦁  Have alternate plans for a late arrival or make backup airline reservations for must-be-there trips.  ⦁  For important trips, plan to leave early enough so that there would still be time to drive to the destination.  ⦁  Advise those who are waiting at the destination that the arrival may be delayed. Know how to notify them      when delays are encountered.  ⦁  Manage passengers’   expectations.   Make sure passengers   know   that they   might not arrive on   a firm       schedule, but if they need to arrive by a certain time, they may make alternative plans.  ⦁  Eliminate pressure to return home, even on a casual day flight, by carrying a small overnight kit containing      prescriptions, contact lens solutions, toiletries, or other necessities on every flight.  

The key to managing external pressure is to be ready for and accept delays. Remember that people get delayed when traveling on  airlines, driving   a car,   or   taking   a bus.   The pilot’s   goal is    manage risk,   not create hazards.  

During each flight, decisions should be made regarding events involving interactions between the four risk elements—PIC, aircraft,  environment, and external pressures. The decision-making process involves an evaluation of each of these risk elements to achieve an  accurate perception of the flight situation.  [Figure 1-2]  

![](images/a13eceb57ff122fae4118c06dc1fac2e509d55e84fce2fb68945bed69660866b.jpg)  
Figure 1-2.  One of the most important decisions that the pilot in command makes is the go/no-go decision. Evaluating each of these  risk elements can help the pilot decide whether a flight should be conducted or continued.  

# IMSAFE Checklist  

As mentioned earlier, one of the best ways that single pilots can identify risk associated with physical and mental readiness for flying  is to use the IMSAFE checklist acronym.  [Figure 1-3]  

![](images/491baff8dbd1793c1a40a08053d5a640b935f1118d9b1365b5b6906dfacd63b8.jpg)  
Figure 1-3.  Prior    flight, pilots   may use a   checklist to   assess   their fitness,   just as   they   evaluate the aircraft’s airworthiness.  

1.   I llness—Am I sick? Illness is an obvious pilot risk.  

2.   M edication—Am I taking any medicines that might affect my judgment or make me drowsy?  

3.   S tress—Am I under psychological pressure from the job? Do I have money, health, or family problems?  Stress causes concentration and performance problems. While the regulations list medical conditions that  require grounding, stress is not among them. A thorough evaluation of risk accounts for the effects of stress  on performance.  

4.   A lcohol—Have I been drinking within 8 hours? Within 24 hours? A small amount of alcohol can impair  flying skills. Alcohol also renders a pilot more susceptible to disorientation and hypoxia.  

5.   F atigue—Am I tired and not adequately rested? Fatigue continues to be one of the most insidious hazards  to flight safety, as it may not be apparent to a pilot until serious errors are made.  

6.   E motion—Am I emotionally upset? The emotions of anger, depression, and anxiety from such events as a  serious argument; death in the family; separation or divorce; loss of employment; and/or financial problems  not only decrease alertness, but may also lead to taking risks that border on self-destruction. A pilot who  experiences an emotionally upsetting event may choose to refrain from flying until the pilot has  satisfactorily recovered.  

# Assessing Risk  

Assessment of risk is an important part of good risk management. For example, the hazard of a nick in the propeller poses a risk only  if the airplane is flown. If the damaged prop is exposed to the constant vibration of normal engine operation, there is a high risk is that  it could fracture and cause catastrophic damage to the engine and/or airframe and the passengers.  

Every flight has hazards and some level of risk associated with it. It is critical that pilots and especially learners can differentiate in  advance between a low-risk flight and a high-risk flight, and then establish a review process and develop risk mitigation strategies to  address flights throughout that range.  

For the single pilot, assessing risk is not as simple as it sounds. For example, the pilot acts as his or her own quality control in making  decisions. If a fatigued pilot who has flown 16 hours is asked if he or she is too tired to continue flying, the answer may be no. Most  pilots are goal oriented and, when asked to accept a flight, there is a tendency to deny personal limitations while adding weight to  issues not germane to the mission. For example, pilots of helicopter emergency services (EMS) have been known to make flight  decisions   that add   significant weight to   the patient’s   welfare.   These pilots   add   weight to   intangible factors   (the patient in   this case)  and fail to appropriately quantify actual hazards such as fatigue or weather when making flight decisions. The single pilot deals with  the intangible factors that may draw one into a hazardous position. Therefore, he or she has a greater vulnerability than a full crew.  

Examining National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports and other accident research can help a pilot learn to assess risk  more effectively. For example, the accident rate during night VFR decreases by nearly 50 percent once a pilot obtains 100 hours and  continues to decrease until the 1,000- hour level. The data suggest that for the first 500 hours, pilots flying VFR at night might want  to establish higher personal limitations than are required by the regulations and, if applicable, apply instrument flying skills in this  environment.  

Several risk assessment models are available to assist in the process of assessing risk. The models, all taking slightly different  approaches, seek a common goal of assessing risk in an objective manner.  

![](images/3884c9654591b9cc71eb5e0f843b245b316f0946951565c71779f0259c1c4507.jpg)  
The most basic tool is the risk matrix.  [Figure 1-4]  It assesses two items: the likelihood of an event occurring and the consequence of  that event.  

# Likelihood of an Event  

Likelihood is nothing more than taking a situation and determining the probability of its occurrence. It is rated as probable,  occasional, remote, or improbable. For example, a pilot is flying from point A to point B (50 miles) in marginal visual flight rules  (MVFR) conditions. The likelihood of encountering potential instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is the first question the  pilot needs   to   answer.   The experiences   of   other   pilots,   coupled   with   the forecast, might cause the pilot to   assign   “occasional” to   determine the probability of encountering IMC.  

The following are guidelines for making assignments.  

⦁  Probable—an event will occur several times.  ⦁  Occasional—an event will probably occur sometime.  ⦁  Remote—an event is unlikely to occur but is possible.  ⦁  Improbable—an event is highly unlikely to occur.  

# Severity of an Event  

The next element is   the severity   or   consequence   of   a pilot’s   action(s).   It can   relate   to   injury   and/or   damage.    the individual in the  example above is not an instrument flight rules (IFR) pilot, what are the consequences of encountering inadvertent IMC? In this case,  because the pilot is not IFR rated, the consequences could be fatal. The following are guidelines for this assignment.  

⦁  Catastrophic—results in fatalities, total loss  ⦁  Critical—severe injury, major damage  ⦁  Marginal—minor injury, minor damage  ⦁  Negligible—less than minor injury, less than minor system damage  

Assessing risk may be the most difficult part of risk management and applying the terms described above to specific risks takes some  practice. Once you have assessed risk likelihood and severity for all identified risks, you can readily classify the overall risk level for  that hazard. For example, simply connecting the two factors as shown in  Figure 1-4  indicates the risk is high and the pilot may  consider whether to not fly or fly only after finding ways to mitigate, eliminate, or control the risk.  

# Risk  

The final step in risk management is mitigation, which is the payoff for accomplishing the entire risk management process and will  often allow for mission accomplishment (the reason most pilots fly). By effectively mitigating known risks to acceptable levels, pilots  can complete their planned flights safely or ensure that alternate options are selected for those rare occasions when the planned or  ongoing flight cannot be completed.  

There are almost an infinite number of actions you can take, depending on the nature of the hazard or risk. For example, the pilot  flying from point A to point B (50 miles) in MVFR conditions has several ways to reduce risk:  

⦁  Drive.  ⦁  Wait for the weather to improve to good visual flight rules (VFR) conditions.  ⦁  Take a pilot who is rated as an IFR pilot.  ⦁  Delay the flight.  ⦁  Cancel the flight.  

Risk mitigation often begins days, sometimes weeks, before a planned flight. For example, a pilot flying a single-engine piston  aircraft without ice protection lives in the Pacific Northwest and is planning a trip in January for a scheduled speech. While keeping  the long-range weather forecast in mind, planning in advance gives the pilot several options to mitigate risk:  

⦁  Book commercial flight/transfer the risk to the airlines.  ⦁  Change the date of the event to accommodate weather.  ⦁  Cancel flight altogether.  ⦁  Depart a day early from the Pacific Northwest to avoid an incoming low-pressure area that will bring low      IFR and certain icing conditions.  

After all mitigating steps have been completed, you may confront the possibility that a flight cannot be made or continued for a  variety of reasons not only for yourself but also for your passengers. Remember that many pilots have ignored or failed to mitigate  serious and high-risk hazards, and a tragic fatal accident is all too often the result.  

# Flight Risk Assessment Tools  

Because every flight has some level of risk, it is critical that pilots can differentiate, in advance, between a low risk flight and a high- risk flight, establish a review process, and develop risk mitigation strategies. A Flight Risk Analysis Tool (FRAT) enables proactive  hazard identification, is easy to use, and can visually depict risk. It is a tool many pilots use to make better go/no-go decisions.  

# Why Should I Use a FRAT?  

“In   the thick” is   no   time to   try   to   mitigate a potentially   hazardous   outcome.   When   preparing   for   a flight or   maintenance   task, pilots  and maintenance technicians may set aside time to stop and think about the hazards involved.  

Just thinking about this task may not consider the actual risk exposure. We may allow our personal desires to manipulate our risk  assessment in order to meet personal goals. A formal process using pen and paper gives a perspective on the entire risk picture and is  a good way to make a thorough analysis.  

A risk assessment tool allows pilots to see the risk profile of a flight in its planning stages. Each pilot determines an acceptable level  of risk for flight based on the type of operation, environment, aircraft used, training, and overall flight experience. When the risk for a  flight exceeds the acceptable level, the hazards associated with that risk may be further evaluated and the risk reduced. A higher risk  flight might not be operated if the hazards cannot be mitigated to an acceptable level.  

# What Do I Do with My Score?  

When using a FRAT, the pilot creates numerical thresholds that trigger additional levels of scrutiny prior to a go/no-go decision for  the flight. These thresholds help ensure that the safety standards of each individual flight are maintained. However, it is important that  the pilot create realistic thresholds. If every flight is within the acceptable range under any condition, it is likely that the thresholds  have not been set correctly.  

An effective FRAT has at least three possible score ranges. These are often grouped into green, yellow and red sections.  

⦁  RED (HIGH): Risk likelihood and/or severity is normally reduced to lower levels before departure. Unless      the risks involved in the flight can be mitigated (different crew/adding a copilot, better equipment, delayed      launch   time…)   flight cancellation   occurs.  

⦁  YELLOW (SERIOUS): Risk likelihood and/or severity needs reduction to lower levels before departure.  Begin by mitigating some of the higher scoring items, and consider consulting with a  flight instructor   or mechanic if the score remains in the yellow.  

⦁  GREEN (MEDIUM): Flight can depart or continue, but risk severity and/or likelihood may be reduced.  

No FRAT can anticipate all the hazards that may impact a particular flight but there are some common hazards that GA pilots  encounter regularly. The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) has developed a free online Flight Risk Awareness Tool  (FRAT) to help flightcrews quickly assess threats to safety for a particular flight. Developed as part of a study, the FRAT presents  operators with an easy-to-understand summary of the risks associated with each mission. No identifying data is collected to produce a  risk analysis and pilots can try the tool before putting it to use on a live flight. This downloadable tool presents pilots with an easy-to­ understand summary of the risks associated with each flight and can be found at  https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/flight­ risk-assessment-tool.pdf  

# Three-P Model for Pilots  

As we have just learned with the Identify, Assess, & Mitigate model, risk management is a decision-making process designed to  identify or perceive hazards systematically, assess the degree of risk associated with a hazard, and determine the best course of action  to mitigate the risk. For example, the Perceive, Process, Perform (3P) model for aeronautical decision-making (ADM) offers a  simple, practical, and structured way for pilots to manage risk.  [Figure 1-5]  

![](images/683ec411f4e9d000e3a1cb9c6780e5e1030db7b98bc4c9111de81d1cb588793a.jpg)  
Figure 1-5.  3P Model (Perceive, Process, and Perform).  

To help understand the 3P model, it may be easier to relate this concept to the three steps of the Risk Management Process discussed  earlier in this chapter. Recall that these three steps include identifying the risk, assessing the risk, and finally mitigating the risk.  Imagine the 3P model in parallel to those three steps by perceiving (identifying the risk), processing (assessing the risk), and  performing (mitigating the risk).  

To use the 3P model, the pilot:  

⦁  Perceives the given set of circumstances for a flight.  ⦁  Processes by evaluating the impact of those circumstances on flight safety.  ⦁  Performs by implementing the best course of action.  

In the first step, the goal is to develop situational awareness by perceiving hazards, which are present events, objects, or  circumstances that could contribute to an undesired future event. In this step, the pilot systematically identifies and lists hazards  associated with all aspects of the flight: pilot, aircraft, environment, and external pressures. It is important to consider how individual  hazards might combine. Consider, for example, the hazard that arises when a new instrument pilot with no experience in actual  instrument conditions wants to make a cross-country flight to an airport with low ceilings in order to attend an important business  meeting.  

In the second step, the goal is to process this information to determine whether the identified hazards constitute risk, which is defined  as the future impact of a hazard that is not controlled or eliminated. The degree of risk posed by a given hazard can be measured in  terms of exposure (number of people or resources affected), severity (extent of possible loss), and probability (the likelihood that a  hazard will cause a loss). If the hazard is low ceilings, for example, the level of risk depends on a number of other factors, such as  pilot training and experience, aircraft equipment, and fuel capacity.  

In the third step, the goal is to perform by taking action to eliminate hazards or mitigate risk, and then continuously evaluate the  outcome of this action. With the example of low ceilings at destination, for instance, the pilot can perform good ADM by selecting a  suitable alternate, knowing where to find good weather, and carrying sufficient fuel to reach it. This course of action would mitigate  the risk. The pilot also has the option to eliminate it entirely by waiting for better weather.  

Once the pilot has completed the 3P decision process and selected a course of action, the process begins again because the set of  circumstances brought about by the course of action requires analysis. The decision-making process is a continuous loop of  perceiving, processing, and performing.  

It is never too early to start teaching risk management. Using the 3P model gives  flight instructor s a tool to teach them a structured, efficient, and systematic way to identify hazards, assess risk, and implement effective risk controls. Practicing risk management  needs to be as automatic in general aviation (GA) flying as basic aircraft control. Consider making the 3P discussion a  standard feature of the preflight discussion. As is true for other flying skills, risk management habits are best developed through  repetition and consistent adherence to specific procedures.  

# Hazard List for Aviation Technicians  

AMTs should learn about risk management early in training. Instructors tasked with integrating risk management into instruction can  turn to hazard assessments that identify the safety risks associated with the facility being used, the tools used in the procedure, and/or  the job being performed.  

The process for identifying hazards can be accomplished through the use of checklists, lessons learned, compliance  inspections/audits, accidents/near misses, regulatory developments, and brainstorming sessions. For example, aviation accident  reports from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) can be used to generate discussions pertaining to faulty maintenance  that led to aircraft accidents. All available sources should be used for identifying, characterizing, and controlling safety risks.  

The 3P model can also be adapted for use in a nonflight environment, such as a maintenance facility. For example, the AMT  perceives a hazard, processes its impact on shop or personnel safety, and then performs by implementing the best course of action to  mitigate the perceived risk.  

# Pilot Self-Assessment  

Setting personal minimums is an important step in mitigating risk, and safe pilots know how to properly self-assess. For example, in  the opening scenario, the aircraft Mary plans to fly may have a maximum crosswind component of 15 knots listed in the aircraft flight  manual (AFM), but she only has experience with 10 knots of direct crosswind. It could be unsafe to exceed a 10 knot-crosswind  component without additional training. Therefore, the 10 knot-crosswind   experience   level should   be Mary’s   personal limitation   until  additional training with Daniel provides her with additional experience for flying in crosswinds that exceed 10 knots.  

Pilots in training should be taught that exercising good judgment begins prior to taking the controls of an aircraft. Often, pilots  thoroughly check their aircraft to determine airworthiness, yet do not evaluate their own fitness for flight. Just as a checklist is used  when preflighting an aircraft, a personal checklist based on such factors as experience, currency, and comfort level can help  determine    a pilot   is   prepared   for   a particular   flight.   The   FAA’s   “Personal   Minimums   Checklist”   located   in   Appendix   D is   an   excellent tool for pilots to use in self-assessment. This checklist reflects the PAVE approach to risk mitigation discussed in the  previous paragraphs.  

Worksheets for a more in-depth   risk   assessment   are   located   in   the   “FAA/Industry   Training   Standards   Personal   and   Weather   Risk   Assessment Guide” located online at  www.faa.gov . This guide is designed to assist pilots in developing personal standardized  procedures for accomplishing PIC responsibilities and in making better preflight and inflight weather decisions.  Flight instructor s  should stress that frequent review of the personal guide keeps the information fresh and increases a pilot’s ability to recognize the  conditions in which a new risk assessment should be made, a key element in the decision-making process.  

# Situational Awareness  

Situational awareness is the accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk  elements that affect safety before, during, and after the flight. Maintaining situational awareness requires an understanding of the  relative significance of these factors and their future impact on the flight. When situationally aware, the pilot has an overview of the  total operation and is not fixated on one perceived significant factor. Some of the elements inside the aircraft to be considered are the  status of aircraft systems, pilot, and passengers. In addition, an awareness of the environmental conditions of the flight, such as spatial  orientation of the aircraft and its relationship to terrain, traffic, weather, and airspace should be maintained.  

To maintain situational awareness, all of the skills involved in ADM are used. For example, an accurate perception of the pilot’s   fitness can be achieved through self-assessment and recognition of hazardous attitudes. A clear assessment of the status of navigation  equipment can be obtained through workload management and establishing a productive relationship with ATC can be accomplished  by effective resource use.  

# Obstacles to Maintaining Situational Awareness  

Many   obstacles   exist   that   can   interfere   with   a pilot’s   ability   to   maintain   situational   awareness.   For   example,   fatigue,   stress, or work  overload can cause the pilot to fixate on a single perceived important item rather than maintaining an overall awareness of the flight  situation.    contributing   factor   in   many   accidents    a distraction,   which   diverts   the pilot’s   attention   from   monitoring   the   instruments  or scanning outside the aircraft. Many flight deck distractions begin as a minor problem, such as a gauge that is not reading correctly,  but result in accidents as the pilot diverts attention to the perceived problem and neglects to properly control the aircraft.  

Fatigue, discussed as an obstacle to learning, is also an obstacle to maintaining situational awareness. It is a threat to aviation safety  because it impairs alertness and performance.  [Figure 1-6]  The term is used to describe a range of experiences from sleepy, or tired,  to exhausted. Two major physiological phenomena create fatigue: sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption.  

![](images/bdb121d1bc695c2a375209710df374eeb9b3235682dc442df02a9778e251d0f5.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.  Fatigue is a threat to aviation safety because it impairs alertness and performance.  

Fatigue is a normal response to many conditions common to flight operations because characteristics of the flight deck environment,  such as low barometric pressure, humidity, noise, and vibration, make pilots susceptible to fatigue. The only effective treatment for  fatigue is adequate sleep. As fatigue progresses, it is responsible for increased errors of omission, followed by errors of commission,  and microsleeps, or involuntary sleep lapses lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes. For obvious reasons, errors caused by these  short absences can have significant hazardous consequences in the aviation environment.  

Sleep-deprived pilots may not notice sleepiness or other fatigue symptoms during preflight and departure flight operations. Once  underway and established on altitude and heading, sleepiness and other fatigue symptoms tend to manifest themselves. Extreme  fatigue can cause uncontrolled and involuntary shutdown of the brain. Regardless of motivation, professionalism, or training, an  individual who is extremely sleepy can lapse into sleep at any time, despite the potential consequences of inattention. There are a  number of countermeasures for coping with fatigue, as shown in  Figure 1-7.  

![](images/9db9741ab5dc3b3db8ba2a7bf243c17acdf3302ce8d37e377b5b3fc75aec4e39.jpg)  
Figure 1-7.  Countermeasures for coping with fatigue.  

Complacency presents another obstacle to maintaining situational awareness. Defined as overconfidence from repeated experience on  a specific activity, complacency has been implicated as a contributing factor in numerous aviation accidents and incidents. Like  fatigue,   complacency   reduces   the pilot’s   effectiveness   in   the flight deck.   However,   complacency    harder   to   recognize than   fatigue,  since everything is perceived to be progressing smoothly. Highly reliable automation has been shown to induce overconfidence and  complacency. This can result in a pilot following the instructions of the automation even when common sense suggests otherwise. If  the pilot assumes the autopilot is   doing   its   job,   he or   she does not crosscheck   the instruments   or   the aircraft’s   position   frequently. If  the autopilot fails, the pilot may not be mentally prepared to fly the aircraft manually. Instructors should be especially alert to  complacency in learners with significant flight experience. For example, a pilot receiving a flight review in a familiar aircraft may be  prone to complacency.  

Advanced avionics have created a high degree of redundancy and dependability in modern aircraft systems, which can  promote complacency and inattention. During flight training, the  flight instructor  should emphasize that routine flight operations may lead to a sense of complacency, which can threaten flight safety by reducing situational awareness.  

By asking about positions of other aircraft in the traffic pattern, engine instrument indications, and the aircraft’s location in relation to  references on a chart, the  flight  instructor can determine if the learner is maintaining situational awareness. The  flight  instructor can also attempt to focus the learner’s attention on an imaginary problem with the communication or navigation equipment. The  flight  instructor should point out that situational awareness is not being maintained if the learner diverts too much attention away from other tasks, such as controlling the aircraft or scanning for traffic. These are simple exercises that can be done throughout  flight training, which help emphasize the importance of maintaining situational awareness.  

# Operational Pitfalls  

There are numerous classic behavioral traps that can ensnare the unwary pilot. Pilots, particularly those with considerable experience,  try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, and meet schedules. This basic drive to demonstrate achievements can have an  adverse effect on safety and can impose an unrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful conditions. These tendencies  ultimately may bring about practices that are dangerous and sometimes illegal and may lead to a mishap. Learners develop awareness  and learn to avoid many of these operational pitfalls through effective ADM training. The scenarios and examples provided by  instructors during ADM instruction should involve these pitfalls.  [Figure 1-8]  

# Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM)  

Single pilot resource management (SRM) is defined as the art and science of managing all the resources (both onboard the aircraft  and from outside sources) available to a single pilot (prior to and during flight) to ensure the successful outcome of the flight. SRM  includes the concepts of Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM), Risk Management (RM), Task Management (TM), Automation  Management (AM), Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) Awareness, and Situational Awareness (SA). SRM training helps the pilot  maintain situational awareness by managing the automation and associated aircraft control and navigation tasks. This enables the pilot  to accurately identify, assess, and manage risk and make accurate and timely decisions.  

SRM is all about helping pilots learn how to gather information, analyze it, and make decisions. Although the flight is coordinated by  a single person and not an onboard flightcrew, the use of available resources such as air traffic control (ATC) and Flight Service  replicates the principles of CRM.  

![](images/f6aa8a5eea5b0a8fef0b0aa737f0ca3697ccd5589ef9ff179e8f40efc5ad8b8e.jpg)  

# SRM and the 5P Check  

SRM is about gathering information, analyzing it, and making decisions. Learning how to identify problems, analyze the information,  and make informed and timely decisions is not as straightforward as the training involved in learning specific maneuvers. Learning  how   to   judge a situation   and   “how   to   think” in   the endless   variety   of   situations   encountered   while flying   out in   the “real world” is   more difficult. There is no one right answer in ADM; rather, each pilot is expected to analyze each situation in light of experience  level, personal minimums, and current physical and mental readiness level, and make his or her own decision.  

SRM sounds good on paper, but it requires a way for pilots to understand and use it in their daily flights. One practical application is  called   the “Five Ps” (5   Ps).   [Figure 1-9]  The 5   Ps   consist of   “the Plan,   the Plane,   the Pilot, the Passengers,   and   the Programming.”  Each of these areas consists of a set of challenges and opportunities that face a single pilot. And each can substantially increase or  decrease the risk   of   successfully   completing   the flight based   on   the pilot’s   ability    make informed   and   timely   decisions.   The 5 Ps are  used   to   evaluate the pilot’s   current situation   at key   decision   points   during   the flight, or   when   an   emergency   arises. These decision  points include preflight, pretakeoff, hourly or at the midpoint of the flight, predescent, and just prior to the final approach fix or for  visual flight rules (VFR) operations, just prior to entering the traffic pattern.  

![](images/5f243611b63d005b4faf5a255bbfb2f315b08cd5d2a06ca31102e1839f40b72f.jpg)  
Figure 1-9.  The 5P checklist.  

The 5 Ps are based on the idea that the pilot has essentially five variables that impact his or her environment and that can cause the  pilot to make a single critical decision, or several less critical decisions, that when added together can create a critical outcome. This  concept stems from the belief that current decision-making models tend to be reactionary in nature. A change must occur and be  detected to drive a risk management decision by the pilot. For instance, many pilots use risk management sheets that are filled out by  the pilot prior to takeoff. These form a catalog of risks that may be encountered that day and turn them into numerical values. If the  total exceeds a certain level, the flight is altered or canceled. Informal research shows that while these are useful documents for  teaching risk factors, they are almost never used outside of formal training programs. The 5P concept is an attempt to take the  information contained in those sheets and in the other available models and use it.  

The 5P concept relies on the pilot to adopt a scheduled review of the critical variables at points in the flight where decisions are most  likely to be effective. For instance, the easiest point to cancel a flight due to bad weather is before the pilot and passengers walk out  the door to load the aircraft. So, the first decision point is preflight in the flight planning room, where all the information is readily  available to make a sound decision, and where communication and Fixed Base Operator (FBO) services are readily available to make  alternate travel plans.  

The second easiest point in the flight to make a critical safety decision is just prior to takeoff. Few pilots have ever had to make an  emergency takeoff. While the point of the 5P check is to help the pilot fly, the correct application of the 5P before takeoff is to assist  in making a reasoned go/no-go decision based on all the information available. These two points in the process of flying are critical  go/no-go points on each and every flight.  

The third place to review the 5 Ps is at the midpoint of the flight. Often, pilots may wait until the Automated Terminal information  Service (ATIS) is in range to check weather, yet at this point in the flight many good options have already passed behind the aircraft  and pilot. Additionally, fatigue and low-altitude hypoxia serve to rob the pilot of much of his or her energy by the end of a long and  tiring flight day. This leads to a transition from a decision-making mode to an acceptance mode on the part of the pilot. If the flight is  longer than 2 hours, the 5P check should be conducted hourly.  

The last two decision points are just prior to decent into the terminal area and just prior to the final approach fix, or if VFR just prior  to entering the traffic pattern, as preparations for landing commence. Some pilots execute approaches with the expectation that they  will land out of the approach every time. When using a risk management thought process, the pilot realizes that changing conditions  (the 5   Ps   again)   may   cause the pilot to   divert or   execute the missed   approach   on   each   approach.   Let’s   look   at a detailed   discussion of  each of the Five Ps.  

# The Plan  

The plan can also be called the mission or the task. It contains the basic elements of cross-country planning, weather, route, fuel,  publications currency, etc. The plan should be reviewed and updated several times during the course of the flight. A delayed takeoff  due to maintenance, fast moving weather, and a short notice temporary flight restriction (TFR) may all radically alter the plan. The  plan is not only about the flight plan, but also all the events that surround the flight and allow the pilot to accomplish the mission. The  plan is always being updated and modified and is especially responsive to changes in the other four remaining Ps. If for no other  reason,   the 5P   check   reminds   the pilot that the day’s   flight plan    real life and   subject to   change at any   time.  

Obviously, weather is a huge part of any plan. The addition of real time data link weather information gives the pilot a real advantage  in inclement weather, but only if the pilot is trained to retrieve, and evaluate the weather in real time without sacrificing situational  awareness. And of course, weather information should drive a decision, even if that decision is to continue on the current plan. Pilots  of aircraft without data   link weather should get updated weather in flight through Flight  Service .  

# The Plane  

Both the plan and the plane are fairly familiar to most pilots. The plane consists of the usual array of mechanical and cosmetic issues  that every aircraft pilot, owner, or operator can identify. With the advent of advanced avionics, the plane has expanded to include  database currency, automation status, and emergency backup systems that were unknown a few years ago. Much has been written  about single-pilot IFR flight both with and without an autopilot. While this is a personal decision, it is just that—a decision. Low IFR  in a non-autopilot equipped aircraft may depend on several of the other Ps to be discussed. Pilot proficiency, currency, and fatigue are  among them.  

# The Pilot  

Flying, especially when used for business transportation, can expose the pilot to high altitude flying, long distance and endurance, and  more challenging weather.  

The combination of late night, pilot fatigue, and the effects of sustained flight above 5,000 feet may cause pilots to become less  discerning, less critical of information, less decisive, and more compliant and accepting. Just as the most critical portion of the flight  approaches (for instance, a night instrument approach in the weather after a 4-hour   flight),   the pilot’s   guard    down   the most. The 5P   process helps a pilot recognize the physiological situation at the end of the flight before takeoff and continues to update personal  conditions as the flight progresses. Once risks are identified, the pilot is in a better position to make alternate plans that lessen the  effect of these factors and provide a safer solution.  

# The Passengers  

One of the key differences between CRM and SRM may include the way passengers interact with the pilot. The pilot of a single-pilot  aircraft may   often   interact with   the passengers.   In   fact, the pilot and   passengers   may   sit within   arm’s   reach.  

The desire   of   the passengers    make airline connections   or   important business   meetings   enters   easily   into   this   pilot’s   decision-making  loop. Done in a healthy and open way, this can be a positive factor. Consider a flight to Dulles Airport and the passengers, both close  friends and business partners, need to get to Washington, D.C., for an important meeting. The weather is VFR all the way to southern  Virginia, then turns to low IFR as the pilot approaches Dulles. A pilot employing the 5P approach might consider reserving a rental  car at an airport in northern North Carolina or southern Virginia to coincide with a refueling stop. Thus, the passengers have a way to  get to Washington, and the pilot has an out to avoid being pressured into continuing the flight if the conditions do not improve.  

Passengers can also be pilots. If no one is designated as pilot in command (PIC) and unplanned circumstances arise, the decision- making styles of several self-confident pilots may conflict.  

Pilots also need to understand that non-pilots may not understand the level of risk involved in the flight. There is an element of risk in  every flight. That is why SRM calls it risk management, not risk elimination. While a pilot may feel comfortable with the risk present  in a night IFR flight, the passengers may not. A pilot employing SRM should ensure the passengers are involved in the decision- making and given tasks and duties to keep them busy and involved. If, upon a factual description of the risks present, the passengers  decide to buy an airline ticket or rent a car, then a good decision has generally been made. This discussion also allows the pilot to  move past what he or she  thinks  the passengers want to do and find out what they actually  want  to do. This removes self-induced  pressure from the pilot.  

# The Programming  

The electronic instrument displays, GPS, and autopilot reduce pilot workload and increase pilot situational awareness. While  programming and operation of these devices are fairly simple and straightforward, unlike the analog instruments they replace, they  tend   to   capture the pilot’s   attention   and   hold   it for   long   periods   of   time.   To   avoid   this   phenomenon,   the pilot should   plan   in advance  when and where the programming for approaches, route changes, and airport information gathering should be accomplished as well as  times it should not. Pilot familiarity with the equipment, the route, the local air traffic control environment, and personal capabilities  vis-  $\cdot\grave{\mathbf{a}}$  -vis the automation should drive when, where, and how the automation is programmed and used.  

The pilot should also consider what his or her capabilities are in response to last-minute changes of the approach (and the  reprogramming required) and ability to make large-scale changes (a reroute for instance) while hand flying the aircraft. Since formats  are not standardized,   simply   moving   from   one manufacturer’s   equipment to   another   should   give the pilot pause and   may   require   more  conservative planning and decisions.  

The SRM process    simple.   At least five times before and   during   the flight, the pilot should   review   and   consider   the “Plan,   the Plane,  the Pilot, the Passengers,   and   the Programming” and   make the appropriate decision   required   by   the current situation.   It is   often said  that failure to make a decision is a decision. Under SRM and the 5 Ps, even the decision to make no changes to the current plan is  made through careful consideration of all the risk factors present.  

# Information Management  

The volume of information presented in aviation training is enormous, but part of the process of good SRM is a continuous flow of  information in and actions out. How a learner manages the flow of information definitely has an effect on the relative success or  failure of each and every flight because proper information contributes to valid decisions. Scenario-based training (SBT) plays an  important part in teaching the learner how to gather pertinent information from all available sources, make appropriate decisions, and  assess the actions taken.  

Some pilots who transition to an unfamiliar sophisticated aircraft, may be overwhelmed and unable to find a specific piece of  information. The first critical information management skill includes understanding the systems and displays at a conceptual level.  Remembering how the system is organized helps the pilot manage the available information. Simulation software and manuals on the  specific system used are of great value in furthering understanding for both the  flight instructor  and the learner.  

A good strategy for accessing and managing the available information from PFD to navigational charts is to stop, look, and analyze.  The goal is for the learner to understand how to monitor, manage, and prioritize the information flow to accomplish specific tasks.  

# Task Management  

Task management (TM), a significant factor in flight safety, is the process by which pilots manage the many, concurrent tasks that  should be performed to safely and efficiently fly a modern aircraft. A task is a function performed by a human, as opposed to one  performed by a machine (e.g., setting the target heading in the autopilot).  

The flight deck is an environment in which important tasks compete for pilot attention at any given time. TM determines which tasks  the pilot(s) should attend to. TM entails initiation of new tasks; monitoring of ongoing tasks to determine their status; prioritization of  tasks based on their importance, status, urgency, and other factors; allocation of human and machine resources to high-priority tasks;  interruption and subsequent resumption of lower priority tasks; and termination of tasks that are completed or no longer relevant.  

When   information   flow   exceeds   a person’s   ability   to   mentally   process   the   information,   any   additional   information   becomes  unattended or displaces other tasks and information already being processed. Once the information flow reaches its limit, two  alternatives exist: shed the unimportant tasks or perform all tasks at a less than optimal level. Like an electrical circuit being  overloaded, either the consumption must be reduced, or a circuit failure is experienced. Once again, SBT helps the learner understand  how to effectively manage tasks and properly prioritize them.  

# Automation Management  

Automation management is the demonstrated ability to control and navigate an aircraft by means of the automated systems installed in  the aircraft. One of the most important concepts of automation management is knowing when to use it and when not to use it. Ideally,  the goal of the flight instructor is to train the learner until he or she understands how to operate the aircraft, using all the available  automation. However, the flight instructor should ensure the learner also knows how and when to operate the aircraft without the  benefit of the automation.  

No one level of automation is appropriate for all flight situations, and the learner should know how to set the level of automation. It is  important for a learner to know how to operate the particular automated system being used. This ensures the learner knows what to  expect, how to monitor for proper operation, and promptly take appropriate action if the system does not perform as expected.  

At the most basic level, managing the autopilot means knowing at all times which modes are engaged and which modes are armed to  engage. The learner needs to verify that armed functions (e.g., navigation tracking or altitude capture) engage at the appropriate time.  Automation management is a good place to practice the callout technique, especially after arming the system to make a change in  course or altitude.  

# Aeronautical Decision-Making  

Aviation training and flight operations are now seen as a system rather than individual concepts. The goal of system safety is for  pilots to utilize all four concepts (ADM, risk management, situational awareness, and SRM) so that risk can be reduced to the lowest  possible level.  

ADM is a systematic approach to the mental process used by aircraft pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in  response to a given set of circumstances. Risk management is a decision-making process designed to systematically identify hazards,  assess the degree of risk, and determine the best course of action associated with each flight. Situational awareness is the accurate  perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk elements that affect safety before,  during, and after the flight. SRM is the art and science of managing all resources (both onboard the aircraft and from outside sources)  available to a single pilot (prior and during flight) to ensure the successful outcome of the flight.  

These key principles are often collectively called ADM. The importance of teaching learners effective ADM skills cannot be  overemphasized. While progress is continually being made in the advancement of pilot training methods, aircraft equipment and  systems, and services for pilots, accidents still occur. Despite all the changes in technology to improve flight safety, one factor  remains the same—the human factor. It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of all aviation accidents are human factors related.  

By taking a system approach to aviation safety, flight instructors interweave aeronautical knowledge, aircraft control skills, ADM,  risk management, situational awareness, and SRM into the training process.  

Historically,   the term   “pilot error” has been   used    describe the causes of   these accidents.   Pilot error   means   that an   action or decision  made by   the pilot was the cause of,   or   contributing   factor   to,   the accident. This   definition   also   includes the pilot’s   failure to make a  decision   or   take action.   From   a broader   perspective,   the phrase “human   factors   related” more aptly   describes these accidents   since it  is usually not a single decision that leads to an accident, but a chain of events triggered by a number of factors.  

The poor judgment chain, or the error chain, describes this concept of contributing factors in a human factors-related accident.  Breaking one link in the chain is all that is usually necessary to change the outcome of the sequence of events. The best way to  illustrate this concept to learners is to discuss specific situations that lead to aircraft accidents or incidents. The following is an  example of the type of scenario that can be presented to illustrate the poor judgment chain.  

A private pilot with 100 hours of flight time made a precautionary landing on a narrow dirt runway at a private airport. The pilot lost  directional control during landing and swerved off the runway into the grass. A witness recalled later that the aircraft appeared to be  too high and fast on final approach, and speculated the pilot was having difficulty controlling the aircraft in high winds. The weather  at the time of the incident was reported as marginal VFR due to rain showers and thunderstorms. When the aircraft was fueled the  following morning, 60 gallons of fuel were required to fill the 62-gallon capacity tanks.  

By discussing the events that led to this incident, instructors can help learners understand how a series of    judgmental errors  contributed to the final outcome of this flight.  

⦁  Weather decision—on the morning of the flight, the pilot was running late and, having acquired a computer      printout of the forecast the night before, he did not  self-brief or  obtain a briefing from  F light  S ervice before      his departure.  

⦁  Flight planning decision/performance chart—the pilot calculated total fuel requirements for the trip based      on a rule-of-thumb figure he had used previously for another airplane. He did not use the fuel tables printed       in the pilot’s operating handbook (POH) for the aircraft he was flying on this trip. After reaching his      destination, the pilot did not request refueling. Based on his original calculations, he believed sufficient      fuel remained for the flight home.  

⦁  Fatigue/failure to recognize personal limitations—in the presence of deteriorating weather, the pilot      departed for the flight home at 5:00 p.m. He did not consider how fatigue and lack of extensive night flying      experience could affect the flight.  ⦁  Fuel exhaustion—with the aircraft fuel supply almost exhausted, the pilot no longer had the option of      diverting to avoid rapidly developing thunderstorms. He was forced to land at the nearest airfield available.  

On numerous occasions during the flight, the pilot could have made decisions which may have prevented this incident. However, as  the chain of events unfolded, each poor decision left him with fewer and fewer options. On the positive side, the pilot made a  precautionary landing at a time and place of his choosing. VFR into IMC accidents often lead to fatalities. In this case, the pilot  landed his aircraft without loss of life.  

Teaching pilots to make sound decisions is the key to preventing accidents. Traditional pilot instruction has emphasized flying skills,  knowledge of the aircraft, and familiarity with regulations. ADM training focuses on the decision-making process and the factors that  affect a   pilot’s   ability    make effective choices.  

Timely decision-making is an important tool for any pilot. The learner who hesitates when prompt action is required, or who makes  the decision to not decide, has made a wrong decision. Emergencies require the pilot to think—assess the situation, choose and  execute the actions that assure safety.  

It is important for flight instructors to teach learners that declaring an emergency when one occurs is an appropriate reaction. Once an  emergency is declared, air traffic control (ATC) gives the pilot priority handling. 14 CFR Section 91.3, Responsibility and Authority  of   the Pilot in   Command,   states that “In   an   inflight emergency   requiring   immediate action,   the pilot in   command   may   deviate from  any   rule of   this   part to   the extent required    meet that emergency.”  

Flight instructors should incorporate ADM, risk management, situational awareness, and SRM throughout the entire training course  for all levels of learners. AC 60-22, Aeronautical Decision Making, provides background references, definitions, and other pertinent  information about ADM training in the general aviation (GA) environment.  [Figure 1-10]  

# The Decision-Making Process  

An understanding of the decision-making process provides learners with a foundation for developing ADM skills. Some situations,  such as engine failures, require a pilot to respond immediately using established procedures with little time for detailed analysis.  Traditionally, pilots have been well trained to react to emergencies but are not as well prepared to make decisions, which require a  more reflective response. Typically during a flight, the pilot has time to examine any changes that occur, gather information, and  assess risk before reaching a decision. The steps leading to this conclusion constitute the decision-making process. When the  decision-making process is presented to learners it is essential to discuss how the process applies to an actual flight situation. To  explain the decision-making process, the instructor can introduce the following steps with the accompanying scenario that places the  learners in the position of making a decision about a typical flight situation.  

# Defining the Problem  

The first step in the decision-making process is to define the problem. This begins with recognizing that a change has occurred or that  an expected change did not occur. A problem is perceived first by the senses, and then is distinguished through insight and  experience. These same abilities, as well as an objective analysis of all available information, are used to determine the exact nature  and severity of the problem.  

One critical error that can be made during the decision-making process is incorrectly defining the problem. For example, failure of a  landing-gear-extended light to illuminate could indicate that the gear is not down and locked into place or it could mean the bulb is  burned out. The actions to be taken in each of these circumstances would be significantly different. Fixating on a problem that does  not exist can   divert the pilot’s   attention   from   important tasks.   The pilot’s   failure to   maintain   an   awareness   of   the circumstances  regarding the flight now becomes the problem. This is why once an initial assumption is made regarding the problem, other sources  should   be used    verify   that the pilot’s   conclusion    correct.  

While on a cross-country flight, Brenda discovers her time en route between two checkpoints is significantly longer than the time she  originally calculated. By noticing this discrepancy, she has recognized a change. Based on insight, cross-country flying experience,  and knowledge of weather systems, she considers the possibility that she has an increased headwind. She verifies that the original  calculations are correct and considers factors that may have lengthened the time between checkpoints, such as a climb or deviation off  course. To determine if there is a change in the winds aloft forecast and to check recent pilot reports, she contacts Flight  Service .  After weighing each information source, she concludes that the headwind has increased. To determine the severity of the  problem, she calculates a new groundspeed and reassesses fuel requirements.

# Choosing a Course of Action  

After the problem has been identified, the pilot evaluates the need to react to it and determines the actions that may be taken to  resolve the situation in the time available. The expected outcome of each possible action should be considered, and the risks assessed  before the pilot decides on a response to the situation.  

Brenda determines the fuel burn if she continues to her destination and considers other options: turning around and landing at a  nearby airport, diverting off course, or landing prior to her destination at an airport en route. She considers the expected outcome of  each possible action and assesses the risks involved. After studying the chart, she concludes an airport with fueling services is within  a reasonable distance along her route. She can refuel there and continue to her destination without a significant loss of time.  

# Implementing the Decision and Evaluating the Outcome  

Although a decision may be reached and a course of action implemented, the decision-making process is not complete. It is important  to think ahead and determine how the decision could affect other phases of the flight. As the flight progresses, the pilot should  continue to evaluate the outcome of the decision to ensure that it is producing the desired result.  

To implement her decision, Brenda plots the course changes and calculates a new estimated time of arrival. She also amends her  flight plan and checks weather conditions at the new destination. As she proceeds to the airport, she continues to monitor  groundspeed, aircraft performance, and weather conditions to ensure no additional steps need to be taken to guarantee the safety of  the flight.  

# Factors Affecting Decision-Making  

It is important to stress to a learner that being familiar with the decision-making process does not ensure he or she has the good  judgment to be a safe pilot. The ability to make effective decisions as PIC depends on a number of factors. Some circumstances, such  as the time available to   make a decision,   may   be beyond   the pilot’s   control. However,   a pilot can   learn    recognize those factors that  can be managed, and learn skills to improve decision-making ability and judgment.  

# Recognizing Hazardous Attitudes  

While the ADM process does not eliminate errors, it helps the pilot recognize errors, and in turn enables the pilot to manage any  errors to minimize their effects. In addition, two steps to improve flight safety are identifying personal attitudes hazardous to safe  flight and learning behavior modification techniques.  

Flight instructors should be able to spot hazardous attitudes in a learner because recognition of hazardous thoughts is the first step  toward neutralizing them.  Flight instructor s should keep in mind that being fit to fly depends on more than just a pilot’s physical c ondition and recency of experience. Hazardous attitudes contribute to poor pilot judgment and affect the quality of decisions.  

Attitude can be defined as a personal motivational predisposition to respond to persons, situations, or events in a given manner.  Studies   have   identified   five   hazardous   attitudes   that   can   affect   a pilot’s   ability   to   make   sound   decisions   and   exercise   authority  properly.  [Figure 1-11]  

![](images/9f5dbc81475c41b27981538a88af299ff14fb9acb8ba4f48aec82750552f3f62.jpg)  
Figure 1-11.  Pilots should examine their decisions carefully to ensure that their choices have not been influenced by a hazardous  attitude  

In order for a learner to self-examine behaviors during flight, the learner should be taught the potential risks caused from hazardous  attitudes and, more importantly, the antidote for each.  [Figure 1-12]  For example, if a learner has an easy time with flight training  and seems to understand things very quickly, there may be a potential for that learner to deve l op a hazardous attitude regarding their ability. A successful  flight instructor   points out the potential for the behavior and teaches the learner the antidote for that attitude.   Hazardous attitudes need to be noticed immediately and corrected with the proper antidote to minimize the potential for any flight  hazard.

Figure 1-12.  Learners in training can be asked to identify hazardous attitudes and the corresponding antidotes when presented with  flight scenarios.  

# Stress Management  

Learning   how   to   recognize and   cope with   stress    another   effective ADM   tool. Stress    the body’s   response to   demands   placed   upon  it. These demands can be either pleasant or unpleasant in nature. The causes of stress for a pilot can range from unexpected weather  or mechanical problems while in flight to personal issues unrelated to flying. Stress is an inevitable and necessary part of life; it adds  motivation   and   heightens   an   individual’s   response to   meet any   challenge.  

Everyone is stressed to some degree all the time. A certain amount of stress is good since it keeps a person alert and prevents  complacency. However, the effects of stress are cumulative and, if not coped with adequately, they eventually add up to an intolerable  burden. Performance generally increases with the onset of stress, peaks, and then begins to fall off rapidly as stress levels exceed a  person’s   ability   to   cope.   The ability   to   make effective decisions   during   flight can   be impaired   by   stress.   Factors,   referred   to as  stressors,   can   increase a pilot’s   risk   of   error    the flight deck.   [Figure 1-13]  

#  

![](images/6bfea5f256ad9b4111a5361dceae06c833c3ccafc40d41dbdf09f50955678c1b.jpg)  
Figure 1-13.  Three types of stressors that can affect pilot performance.  

One way of exploring the subject of stress with a learner is to recognize when stress is affecting performance. If a learner seems  distracted, or has a particularly difficult time accomplishing the tasks of the lesson, the instructor can query the learner. Was the  learner   uncomfortable   or   tired   during   the   flight?   Is   there   some   stress   in   another   aspect   of   the   learner’s   life   that   may   be   causing a  distraction? This may prompt the learner to evaluate how these factors affect performance and judgment. The instructor should also  try to determine if there are aspects of pilot training that are causing excessive amounts of stress for the learner. For example, if the  learner consistently makes a decision not to fly, even though weather briefings indicate favorable conditions, it may be due to  apprehension regarding the lesson content. Stalls, landings, or an impending solo flight may cause concern. By explaining a specific  maneuver in greater detail or offering some additional encouragement, the instructor may be able to alleviate some of the learner’s   stress.  

To help learners manage the accumulation of life stresses and prevent stress overload, instructors can recommend several techniques.  For example, including relaxation time in a busy schedule and maintaining a program of physical fitness can help reduce stress levels.  Learning to manage time more effectively can help pilots avoid heavy pressures imposed by getting behind schedule and not meeting  deadlines. While these pressures may exist in the workplace, learners may also experience the same type of stress regarding their  flight training schedule. Instructors can advise learners to self-assess to determine their capabilities and limitations and then set  realistic goals. In addition, avoiding stressful situations and encounters can help pilots cope with stress.  

# Use of Resources  

To make informed decisions during flight operations, learners should be familiar with the resources found both inside and outside the  flight deck. Since useful tools and sources of information may not always be readily apparent, learning to recognize these resources is  an essential part of ADM training. Resources should not only be identified, but learners should also develop the skills to evaluate  whether they have the time to use a particular resource and the impact that its use would have upon the safety of flight. For example,  the assistance of ATC may be very useful if a pilot is lost. However, in an emergency situation when action needs be taken quickly,  time may not be available to contact ATC immediately. During training,  flight instructor s can routinely point out resources to learners.  

# Internal Resources  

Internal resources are found in the flight deck during flight. However, some of the most valuable internal resources include ingenuity,  knowledge, and skill. Pilots can enhance flight deck resources by improving their own capabilities. This can be accomplished  by pursuing additional training and by frequently reviewing flight information publications including the Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM), instruction manuals for on board equipment, and safety journals.  

With the advent of advanced avionics with glass displays, GPS, and autopilot, flying has become more complex. Avionics and  automation systems are valuable resources, and flight instructors should teach learners how to use this equipment properly. If  learners do not fully understand how to use the equipment, or if they rely on it so much that they become complacent, it can become a  detriment to safe flight.  

Checklists are essential flight deck resources for verifying that the aircraft instruments and systems are checked, set, and operating  properly, as well as ensuring that the proper procedures are performed if there is a system malfunction or inflight emergency.  Learners reluctant to use checklists can be reminded that pilots at all levels of experience refer to checklists, and that the more  advanced the aircraft is, the more crucial checklists become. With the advent of electronic checklists, it has become easier to develop  and   maintain   personal checklists   from   the manufacturer’s   checklist with   additions   for   specific aircraft and   operations.  

In addition, the AFM/POH, which is required to be carried onboard the aircraft, is essential for accurate flight planning and for  resolving inflight equipment malfunctions. Other valuable flight deck resources include current aeronautical charts and publications,  such as the Chart Supplement (CS).  

It should be pointed out to learners that passengers can also be a valuable resource. Passengers can help watch for traffic and may be  able to provide information in an irregular situation, especially if they are familiar with flying. A strange smell or sound may alert a  passenger to a potential problem. The PIC should brief passengers before the flight to make sure that they are comfortable voicing  any concerns.  

# External Resources  

Possibly the greatest external resources during flight are air traffic controllers. ATC can help decrease pilot workload by providing  traffic advisories, radar vectors, and assistance in emergency situations. When learners use ATC during training, they develop the  confidence to ask controllers to clarify instructions and to use ATC as a resource for assistance in unusual circumstances or  emergencies. Fight Service specialists can provide updates on weather, answer questions about airport conditions, and may offer  direction-finding assistance on frequencies used for flight plan communications. These services can be invaluable in enabling pilots to  make informed inflight decisions.  

Throughout training, learners can be asked to identify internal and external resources, which can be used in a variety of flight  situations. For example, if a discrepancy is found during preflight, what resources can be used to determine its significance? In this  case,   the learner’s   knowledge of   the aircraft, the POH,   an   instructor   or   other   experienced   pilot, or   an   AMT   can   be a resource   which  may help define the problem. During cross-country training, learners may be asked to consider the following situation. On a cross- country flight, you become disoriented. Although you are familiar with the area, you do not recognize any landmarks, and fuel is  running low. What resources do you have to assist you? Learners should be able to identify their own skills and  knowledge, aeronautical charts, ATC,  F light  S ervice, and navigation equipment as some of the resources that can be used in this  situation.  

# Workload Management  

Effective workload management ensures that essential operations are accomplished by planning, prioritizing, and sequencing tasks to  avoid work overload. As experience is gained, a pilot learns to recognize future workload requirements and can prepare for high  workload peri ods during times of low workload. Instructors can teach this skill by prompting their learners to prepare for a high  workload. For example, when en route, the learner can be asked to explain the actions that need to be taken during the approach to the  airport. The learner should be able to describe the procedures for traffic pattern entry and landing preparation. Reviewing the  appropriate chart and setting radio frequencies well in advance of need helps reduce workload as the flight nears the airport. In  addition, the learner should listen to the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), Automated Surface Observing  Systems (ASOS), or Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), if available, and then monitor the tower frequency or Common  Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) to get a good idea of what traffic conditions to expect. Checklists should be performed well in  advance so there is time to focus on traffic and ATC instructions. These procedures are especially important prior to entering a high- density traffic area, such as Class B airspace.  

To manage workload, items should be prioritized. This concept should be emphasized to learners and reinforced when training  procedures are performed. For example, during a go-around, adding power, gaining airspeed, and properly configuring the aircraft are  priorities. Informing the tower of the balked landing should be accomplished only after these tasks are completed. learners  should understand that priorities change as the situation changes. If fuel quantity is lower than expected on a cross-country flight, the  priority can shift from making a scheduled arrival time at the destination, to locating a nearby airport to refuel. In an emergency  situation, the first priority is to fly the aircraft and maintain a safe airspeed.  

Another important part of managing workload is recognizing a work overload situation. The first effect of high workload is that the  pilot begins to work faster. As workload increases, attention cannot be devoted to several tasks at one time, and the pilot may begin to  focus on one item. When the pilot becomes task saturated, there is no awareness of inputs from various sources; decisions may be  made on incomplete information, and the possibility of error increases.  [Figure 1-14]  

During   a lesson,   workload   can   be gradually   increased   as the instructor   monitors   the learner’s   management of   tasks.   The instructor  should ensure that the learner has the ability to recognize a work overload situation. When becoming overloaded, the learner should  stop, think, slow down, and prioritize. It is important that the learner understand options that may be available to decrease workload.  For example, locating an item on a chart or setting a radio frequency may be delegated to another pilot or passenger, an autopilot (if  available) may be used, or ATC may be enlisted to provide assistance.  

![](images/efff478707cfb467e442eac492666c9bb1aaf3928db80b64269878d521e6067f.jpg)  
Figure 1-14.  Accidents often occur when flying task requirements exceed pilot capabilities. The difference between these two factors is  called the margin of safety. Note that in this idealized example, the margin of safety is minimal during the approach and landing. At  this point, an emergency or distraction could overtax pilot capabilities, causing an accident.  

# Teaching Decision-Making Skills  

When instructor pilots discuss system safety, they generally worry about the loss of traditional stick-and-rudder skills. The fear is that  emphasis on items such as risk management, ADM, SRM, and situational awareness detracts from the training necessary in  developing safe pilots.  

It is important to understand that system safety flight training occurs in three phases. First, there are the traditional stick and rudder  maneuvers. In order to apply the critical thinking skills that are to follow, pilots should develop a high degree of confidence in their  ability to fly the aircraft. Next, the tenets of system safety are introduced into the training environment as learners begin to understand  how best to identify hazards, manage risk, and use all available resources to make each flight as safe as possible. This can be  accomplished through scenarios that emphasize the skill sets being taught. Finally, the learner may be introduced to more complex  scenarios that focus on several safety-of-flight issues. Thus, scenarios should start out rather simply, then progress in complexity and  intensity as the learner becomes able to handle the increased workload.  

A traditional stick-and-rudder maneuver such as short field landings can be used to illustrate how ADM and risk management can be  incorporated into instruction. In phase l the initial focus is on developing the stick-and-rudder skills required to execute this operation  safely. These include power and airspeed management, aircraft configuration, placement in the pattern, wind correction, determining  the proper aim point and sight picture, etc. By emphasizing these points through repetition and practice, a learner eventually acquires  the skills needed to execute a short field landing.  

Phase II introduces the many factors that come into play when performing a short field landing, which include runway conditions, no- flap landings, airport obstructions, and rejected landings. The introduction of such items need not increase training times. In fact, all  of the hazards or considerations referenced in the short field landing lesson plan may be discussed in detail during the ground portion  of the instructional program. For example, if training has been conducted at an airport that enjoys an obstruction-free 6,000-foot  runway, consider the implications of operating the same aircraft out of a 1,800-foot strip with an obstruction off the departure end.  Add to that additional considerations, such as operating the aircraft at close to its maximum gross weight under conditions of high  density altitude, and now a single training scenario has several layers of complexity. The ensuing discussion proves a valuable  training exercise, and it comes with little additional ground and no added flight training.  

Finally, phase III takes the previously discussed hazards, risks, and considerations, and incorporates them into a complex scenario.  This forces a learner to consider not only a specific lesson item (in this case, short-field landings), but also requires that it be viewed  in the greater context of the overall flight. For example, on a cross-country flight, the learner is presented with a realistic distraction,  perhaps the illness of a passenger. This forces a diversion to an alternate for which the learner has not planned. The new destination  airport has two runways, the longest of which is closed due to construction. The remaining runway is short, but while less than ideal,  should prove suitable for landing. However, upon entering the pattern, the learner finds the electrically driven flaps do not extend.  The learner should now consider whether to press on and attempt the landing or proceed to a secondary alternate.  

If he or she decides to go forward and attempt the landing, this proves an excellent time to test the requisite stick and rudder skills. If  the learner decides to proceed to a second alternate, this opens new training opportunities. Proceeding further tests cross-country  skills, such as navigation, communication, management of a passenger in distress, as well as the other tasks associated with simply  flying the aircraft. The outlined methodology simply takes a series of seemingly unrelated tasks and scripts them into a training  exercise requiring both mechanical and cognitive skills to complete it successfully.  

Scenario-based training (SBT) helps the flight instructor effectively teach ADM and risk management. The what, why, and how of  SBT will be discussed extensively throughout this handbook. In teaching ADM, it is important to remember the learning objective is  for the learner to exercise sound judgment and make good decisions. Thus, the flight instructor should be ready to turn the  responsibility for planning and execution of the flight over to the learner as soon as possible. Although the flight instructor continues  to demonstrate and instruct skill maneuvers, when the learner begins to make decisions, the flight instructor should revert to the role  of mentor and/or learning facilitator.  

The flight instructor is an integral part of the systems approach to training and is crucial to the implementation of an SBT program,  which underlies the teaching of ADM. Remember, for SBT instruction to be effective, it is vital the flight instructor and learner  establish the following information:  

⦁  Scenario destination(s)  ⦁  Desired learning outcome(s)  ⦁  Desired level of learner performance  ⦁  Possible inflight scenario changes  

It is also important for the flight instructor to remember that a good scenario:  

⦁  Is not a test.  ⦁  Will not have a single correct answer.  ⦁  Does not offer an obvious answer.  ⦁  Engages all three learning domains.  ⦁  Is interactive.  ⦁  Should not promote errors.  ⦁  Should promote situational awareness and opportunities for decision-making.  ⦁  Requires time-pressured decisions.  

The flight instructor should make the situation as realistic as possible. This means the learner knows where he or she is going and  what transpires on the flight. While the actual flight may deviate from the original plan, it allows the learner to be placed in a realistic  scenario. The learner should plan the flight to include:  

⦁  Route  ⦁  Destination(s)  ⦁  Weather  ⦁  NOTAMS  ⦁  Possible emergency procedures  

Since the scenarios may have several good outcomes and a few poor ones, the flight instructor should understand in advance which  outcomes are positive and/or negative and give the learner the freedom to make both good and poor decisions. This does not mean  that the learner should be allowed to make an unsafe decision or commit an unsafe act. However, it does allow the learners to make  decisions that fit their experience level and result in positive outcomes.  

Teaching decision-making skills has become an integral part of flight training. The word “decision” is used several times in each ACS  and applicants are judged on their ability to make a decision as well as their ability to perform a task. Thus, it is important for  flight  instructors  to remember that decision-making is a component of the ACS.  

# Assessing SRM Skills  

A   learner’s   performance    often   assessed   only   on   a technical   level.   The   instructor   determines   whether   maneuvers   are   technically  accurate and that procedures are performed in the right order. In SRM assessment, instructors should learn to assess on a different  level. How did the learner arrive at a particular decision? What resources were used? Was risk assessed accurately when a go/no-go  decision was made? Did the learner maintain situational awareness in the traffic pattern? Was workload managed effectively during a  cross-country flight? How does the learner handle stress and fatigue?  

Instructors should continually evaluate learner decision-making ability and offer suggestions for improvement. It is not always  necessary to present complex situations, which require detailed analysis. By allowing learners to make decisions about typical issues  that arise throughout the course of training, such as their fitness to fly, weather conditions, and equipment problems, instructors can  address effective decision-making and allow learners to develop judgment skills. For example, when a discrepancy is found during  preflight inspection, the learner should be allowed to initially determine the action to be taken. Then the effectiveness of the learner’s   choice and other options that may be available can be discussed.  

Opportunities for improving decision-making abilities occur often during training. If the tower offers the learner a runway that  requires landing with a tailwind in order to expedite traffic, the learner can be directed to assess the risks involved and asked to  present alternative actions to be taken. Perhaps the most frequent choice that has to be made during flight training is the go/no-go  decision based on weather. While the final choice to fly lies with the instructor, learners can be asked to assess the weather prior to  each flight and make a go/no-go determination.  

In addition, instructors should utilize SBT to create lessons that are specifically designed to test whether learners are applying SRM  skills. Planning a flight lesson in which the learner is presented with simulated emergencies, a heavy workload, or other operational  problems   can   be valuable in   assessing   the learner’s   judgment and   decision-making skills. During the flight, learner performance can  be evaluated for workload and/or stress management.  

SRM grades are based on these four components:  

⦁  Explain—the learner can verbally identify, describe, and understand the risks inherent in the flight scenario.      The learner needs to be prompted to identify risks and make decisions.  

⦁  Practice—the learner is able to identify, understand, and apply SRM principles to the actual flight situation.      Coaching, instruction, and/or assistance from the  flight instructor   quickly corrects minor deviations and      errors identified by the  flight instructor . The learner is an active decision maker.  

⦁  Manage/Decide—the learner can correctly gather the most important data available both within and outside      the flight deck, identify possible courses of action, evaluate the risk inherent in each course of action, and      make the appropriate decision. Instructor intervention is not required for the safe completion of the flight.  

⦁  Not Observed—any event not accomplished or required.  

Postflight, collaborative assessment or learner centered grading (LCG) also discussed in Chapter 6, Assessment, is a vital component  of   assessing   a learner’s   SRM skills.   As   a reminder,   collaborative assessment includes two   parts: learner   self-assessment and a detailed  assessment by the flight instructor. The purpose of the self-assessment is    stimulate growth    the learner’s   thought processes and,    turn, behaviors. The self-assessment is followed by an in-depth discussion between the flight instructor and the learner,  which compares the  flight instructor ’s assessment to the learner’s self-assessment.  

An important element of SRM skills assessment is that the  flight instructor   provides a clear picture of the progress the learner is  making during the training. Grading should also be progressive. During each flight, the learner should achieve a new level of  learning. For flight one, the automation management area might be a “describe” item. By flight three, it would be a “practice”  item, and by flight five, a “manage-decide” item.

# Introduction  

Derek’s   learner,   Jason,    very   smart   and   able   to   retain   a lot   of   information,   but   has   a tendency   to   rush   through   the   less   exciting  material and shows interest and attentiveness only when performing tasks that he finds to be interesting. This concerns Derek because  he is worried that Jason will overlook many important details and rush through procedures. For a homework assignment Jason was  told to take a very thorough look at Preflight Procedures and that for his next flight lesson they would discuss each step in detail. As  Derek   predicted,   Jason   found   this   assignment   to   be   boring   and   was   not   prepared.   Derek   knows   that   Jason    a “thrill   seeker”   as he  talks about his business, which is a wilderness adventure company. Derek wants to find a way to keep Jason focused and help him  find excitement in all areas of learning so that he will understand the complex art of flying and aircraft safety.  

Learning is the acquisition of knowledge or understanding of a subject or skill through education, experience, practice, or study. This  chapter discusses behavior and how it affects the learning process. An instructor seeks to understand why people act the way they do  and how people learn. An effective instructor uses knowledge of human behavior, basic human needs, the defense mechanisms  humans use that prevent learning, and how adults learn in order to organize and conduct productive learning activit i es.  

# Definitions of Human Behavior  

The study of human behavior is an attempt to explain how and why humans function the way they do. A complex topic, human  behavior is a product both of innate human nature and of individual experience and environment. Definitions of human behavior  abound, depending on the field of study. In the scientific world, human behavior is seen as the product of factors that cause people to  act in predictable ways.  

For example, speaking in public is very high on the list of fears many people have. While no two people react the same to any given  fear, fear itself does trigger certain innate responses such as an increase in breathing rate. How a person handles that fear is a product  of individual experiences. The person who has never spoken in public may be unable to fulfill the obligation. Another person,  knowing his or her job requires public speaking, may ch o ose to take a class on public speaking to learn how to cope with the fear.  

Human behavior is also defined as the result of attempts to satisfy certain needs. These needs may be simple to understand and easy  to identify, such as the need for food and water. They also may be complex, such as the need for respect and acceptance. A working  knowledge of human behavior can help an instructor better understand a learner. It is also helpful to remember that to a large extent  thoughts, feelings, and behavior are shared by all men or women, despite seemingly large cultural differences. For example, fear  causes   humans   to   either   fight   or   flee.   In   the   public   speaking   example   above,   one   person   may   “flee”   by   not   fulfilling   the   obligation.  The other   person   may   “fight” by   learning   techniques to   deal with   fear.  

Another definition of human behavior focuses on the typical life course of humans. This approach emphasizes human development or  the successive phases of growth in which human behavior is characterized by a distinct set of physical, physiological, and behavioral  features. The thoughts, feelings, and behavior of an infant differ radically from those of a teen. Research shows that as an individual  matures, his or her mode of action moves from dependency to self-direction. Therefore, the age of the learner impacts how the  instructor designs the curriculum. Since the average age of a learner can vary, the instructor needs to offer a curriculum that addresses  the varying learner tendency to self-direct.  [Figure 2-1]  

By observing human behavior, an instructor can gain the knowledge needed to better understand him or herself as an instructor as  well as the learning needs of learners. Understanding human behavior leads to successful instruction.  

# Instructor and Learner Relationship  

How does personality type testing affect instructors and learners? Research has led many educational psychologists to feel that based  on personality type, everyone also has an individual style of learning. In this theory, working with that style, rather than against it,  benefits both instructor and learner. Although controversy often swirls around the educational benefits of teaching learners according  to   personality   types, it has gained   a large following   and   been   implemented   at many   levels of   education.   Today’s   learner   can   visit any  number of websites, take a personality test, and discover what type of learner he or she is and how best to study.  

In a continuing quest to figure out why humans do what they do, the mother-daughter team of Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel  Briggs Myers pioneered the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test in 1962. The MBTI was based on Jungian theory, previous  research into personality traits, and lengthy personal observations of human behavior by Myers and Briggs. They believed that much  seemingly random variation in human behavior is actually quite orderly and consistent, being due to basic differences in the ways  individuals prefer to use their perception and judgment.  

They distilled human behavior into sixteen distinct personality types. Inspired by their research, clinical psychologist and author, Dr.  David Keirsey condensed their sixteen types into four groups he calls Guardian, Artisan, Rational, and Idealist. Others have either  contributed or continued to expand personality research and its influence on human behavior. Personality type testing now runs the  gamut from helping people make career choices to helping people choose marriage partners.

Figure 2-1.  The average age of a learner pilot is 34, while the average age of a maintenance learner is 25.  

Not only   does personality   type influence   how   one learns,   it also   influences   how   one teaches. Learning   one’s   personality   type helps an  instructor recognize how he or she instructs. Why is it important to recognize personal instruction style? The match or mismatch  between the way an instructor teaches and the way an individual learns contributes to instructional satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  Learners whose styles are compatible with the teaching styles of an instructor tend to retain information longer, apply it more  effectively, learn more, and have a more positive attitude toward the course in general. Although an instructor cannot change his or  her preferred style of teaching to match a learning style, steps can be taken to actively bridge the differences.  

Consider   the Derek’s   dilemma with   Jason   described   at the beginning   of   this   chapter.   Derek   knows   he is   the type of   instructor   who  provides a clear, precise syllabus and has a tendency to explain with step-by-step procedures. His teaching style relies on traditional  techniques and he often finds himself teaching as he was taught. Observation leads Derek to believe Jason is the type of person who  needs the action, excitement, and variation reflected in his career choice. In an effort to focus Jason on the need to learn all aspects of  flight, Derek sets up a scenario for the day that features how to scout locations for future adventure tours.  

By adjusting the flight scenario, Derek pushes himself out of his lock-step approach to teaching. He has also added an element of  variation to the lesson that not only interests Jason, but is one of the reasons he wants to learn to fly.  

# Motivation  

Motivation is the reason one acts or behaves in a certain way and lies at the heart of goals. A goal is the object of a person’s   effort.  Motivation prompts learners to engage in hard work and affects learner success. Being smart or coordinated seldom guarantees  success,   but motivation   routinely   propels learners   to   the top.   An   important part of   an   aviation   instructor’s   job    to   discover what  motivates each learner and to use this information to encourage him or her to work hard.  

Motivation   is   probably   the dominant force   that governs   the learner’s   progress   and   ability   to   understand   and   can   be used   to   the  advantage of the instructor. Motivation comes in many guises. It may be negative or positive. Negative motivation may engender fear,  for example. While negative motivation may be useful in certain situations, characteristically it is not as effective in promoting  efficient learning as positive motivation.  [Figure 2-2]  Positive motivation is provided by the promise or achievement of rewards.  These rewards may be personal or social, they may involve financial gain, satisfaction of the self-concept, personal gain, or public  recognition.  

![](images/18870e37262c03a874c486f9d6008be96a7d3a4f79aaa565948f01fb68371c0f.jpg)  
Figure 2-2.  Insecure and unpleasant training situations inhibit learning.  

Motivation may be tangible or intangible. Learners seeking intangible rewards are motivated by the desires for personal comfort and  security, group approval, and the achievement of a favorable self-image. The desire for personal comfort and security is a form of  motivation which instructors often forget. All learners want secure, pleasant conditions and a safe environment. If they recognize that  what they are learning may promote these objectives, their attention is easier to attract and hold. Insecure and unpleasant training  situations inhibit learning. Learners also want a tangible return for their efforts. For motivation to be effective on this level, learners  know that their efforts are suitably rewarded. These rewards need to be constantly apparent to the learner during instruction, whether  they are to be financial, self-esteem, or public recognition.  

The tangible rewards of aviation are not always obvious during training. Traditional syllabi often contain lessons with objectives that  are not immediately obvious to the learner.  

These lessons may pay dividends during later instruction, a fact the learner may not appreciate and may result in less knowledge  transfer than if the learner could relate all objectives to an operational need (law of readiness). The instructor should ensure that the  learner is aware of those applications not immediately apparent. To reduce this issue, the instructor should develop appropriate  scenarios that contain the elements to be practiced.  

Everyone wants to avoid pain and injury. Learners normally are eager to identify operations or procedures that help prevent injury or  loss of life. This is especially true when the learner knows that the ability to make timely decisions, or to act correctly in an  emergency, is based on sound principles.  

The attractive features of the activity to be learned also can be a strong motivational factor. Learners are anxious to gain skills that  may be used to their advantage. If they understand that each task is useful in preparing for future activities, they are more willing to  pursue it.  

Another strong motivating force is group approval. Every person wants the approval of peers and superiors. Interest can be stimulated  and maintained by building on this natural desire. Most learners enjoy the feeling of belonging to a group and are interested in  accomplishment, which gives them prestige among their peers.  

Every person seeks to establish a favorable self-image. In certain instances, this self-image may be submerged in feelings of insecurity  or despondency. Fortunately, most people engaged in a task believe that success is possible under the right combination of  circumstances and good fortune. This belief can be a powerful motivating force for learners. An instructor can effectively foster this  motivation by the introduction of perceptions that are solidly based on previously learned factual information easily recognized. Each  additional block of learning should help formulate insight, contributing to the ultimate training goals and promoting confidence in the  overall training program. At the same time, it helps the learner develop a favorable self-image. As this confirmation progresses and  confidence increases, advancement is more rapid and motivation is strengthened.  

Positive motivation is essential to true learning. Negative motivation should be avoided with all but the most overconfident and  impulsive learners. Slumps in learning are often due to declining motivation. Motivation does not remain at a uniformly high level. It  may be affected by outside influences, such as physical or mental disturbances or inadequate instruction.  

The instructor should strive to maintain motivation at the highest possible level. In addition, the instructor should be alert to detect  and counter any lapses in motivation.  

# Where Does the Motivation to Learn Come From?  

Motivation to learn can come from many sources. Some learners have a fundamental interest in aviation and experience sheer  fascination with aircraft or with the experience of flight. Other learners may decide that aviation provides an opportunity to develop a  wide variety of technical, physical, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Some see aviation as a way to boost their self- image or ego. Other learners are motivated by tradition and wish to follow in the footsteps of a relative or close friend. Some learners  are motivated to pursue aviation training because it offers a promising career. To others, aviation offers prestige or acceptance within  social groups. Some may think that aviation offers fun and excitement or simply a more convenient form of transportation. All of  these sources of motivation have one thing in common: they all offer some type of reward in exchange for performing the hard work.  

Aviation instructors should keep in mind that adult learners who are motivated to seek out an educational experience do so primarily  because they have a use for the knowledge or skill being sought. Learning is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Based on this, it is  important instructors determine why a learner enrolled in the course. Based on preference and/or class size, an instructor can conduct  a brief   personal interview   with   the learner   or   have them   complete an   information   form.   Asking   questions   such   as “Why   are you   taking  this   course?” or   “How   do   you   plan    use the information   you   learn    this   course?” may   be all that is   necessary.  

# Learner Questionnaire  

A short questionnaire can be helpful in gathering additional background information. For example, it is helpful to know a learner’s   familiarity   with   the subject matter.   Questions   such   as “Have you   ever   taken   a course in   aircraft maintenance?” or   “Have you   ever  flown   a small airplane?” or   “Have you   had   any   on-the-job   training    avionics?” should   garner   the type of   information   needed.  

A short questionnaire also offers an instructor the chance to discover how different learning styles may improve knowledge transfer  (small groups, independent study, etc.). Another possible way to gather information about a learner is to have him or her write a brief  autobiography which includes any experience with the subjects being taught. However an instructor gathers information about  learners, the information helps the instructor allow for not only personal learning goals for the course, but also the goals and  motivations of the learners, their background in aviation training, as well as their preferences. An instructor armed with this  information can make the experience beneficial to all involved.  

# Maintaining Motivation  

Motivation is generally not something that can be transferred from one person to another. Instructors should become skillful at  recognizing problems with motivation and at encouraging learners to continue to do their best.  

# Rewarding Success  

Positive feedback encourages learners. Practice positive feedback frequently by:  

⦁  Praising incremental successes during training.   $\circ$    Relating daily accomplishments to lesson objectives.  ⦁  Commenting favorably on learner progress and level ability.  

For example, as the learner progresses through training, remark on the milestones. When a learner first performs a task alone,  congratulate him or her on having learned it.  

When   that same skill reaches an   intermediate level,   point out that the learner’s   performance    almost consistent with   the requirements  of the Airman Certification Standards (ACS), the set of standards detailing the knowledge and skills an airman needs to possess and  demonstrate to obtain a pilot certificate. When performance is equal to the ACS requirements, comment favorably on the skill  acquisition. When learner performance exceeds ACS requirements, point out what a benefit this will be when the learner performs  under pressure during a practical test or on the job.  

# Presenting New Challenges  

With each declaration of success, be sure to present learners with the next challenge. For example, when a learner begins to perform a  skill consistently to ACS or PTS requirements, challenge him or her to continue to improve it such that the skill can be performed  under pressure or when distracted. Instructors can also add new problems or situations to create a learning scenario.  

# Drops in Motivation  

Instructors should be prepared to deal with a number of circumstances in which motivation levels drop. It is natural for motivation to  wane somewhat after   the initial excitement of   the learner’s   first days   of   training,   or   between   major   training   events   such   as solo,  evaluations, or practical tests. Drops in motivation appear in several different ways. Learners may come to lessons unprepared or give  the general sense that aviation training is no longer a priority. During these times, it is often helpful to remind learners of their own  stated goals for seeking aviation training.  

Learning plateaus are a common source of frustration, discouragement, and decreased learner motivation. A first line of defense  against this situation is to explain that learning seldom proceeds at a constant pace—no one climbs the ladder of success by exactly  one rung per day. Learners should be encouraged to continue to work hard and be reassured that results will follow.  

# Summary of Instructor Actions  

To ensure that learners continue to work hard, the instructor should:  

1. Ask new learners about their aviation training goals.  2. Reward incremental successes in learning.  3. Present new challenges.  4. Occasionally remind learners about their own stated goals for aviation training.  5. Assure learners that learning plateaus are normal and that improvement will resume with continued effort.  

# Human Needs and Motivation  

Human needs are things all humans require for normal growth and development. These needs have been studied by psychologists and  categorized in a number of ways. Henry A. Murray, one of the founders of personality psychology who was active in developing a  theory of motivation, identified a list of core psychological needs in 1938. He described these needs as being either primary (based on  biological needs, such as the need for food) or secondary (generally psychological, such as the need for independence). Murray  believed the interplay of these needs produce distinct personality types and are internal influences on behavior.  

Murray’s   research   underpins   the work   of   psychologist Abraham   Maslow   who   also   studied   human   needs,   motivation,   and   personality.  While working with monkeys during his early years of research, he noticed that some needs take precedence over others. For  example, thirst is relieved before hunger because the need for water is a stronger need than the need for food. In 1954, Maslow  published what has become known as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.  [Figure 2-3]  According to Maslow, human needs go beyond the  obvious physical needs of food and shelter to include psychological needs, safety and security, love and belongingness, self - esteem,  and self - actualization to achieve one’s goals. Human needs are satisfied in order of importance. Once a need is satisfied, humans  work to satisfy the next level of need. Need satisfaction is an ongoing behavior that determines everyday actions.  

Since Maslow's findings, multiple psychological studies have proven that humans can experience higher levels of motivation while  not having   lower   basic needs   met.   In   a study   from   2011,   researchers   at the University   of   Illinois   found   that Maslow’s   hierarchy was  not universal and the order in which these needs were met did not have much impact on the satisfaction or happiness of an individual.  Maslow’s   theory   has little to   no   empirical data to   support his   findings   on   the five-need hierarchy (Whaba and Bridgewell, 1976).  

Maslow’s hierarchy states that each level has to be meet 100 percent before moving on to the next level of need. However, a person  can still achieve what they were “born to do” while still being hungry.  

What was apparent in multiple studies, however, was that humans have needs that affect their ability to focus on the task at hand.  Learners tend to show little to no motivation or attention if most of their needs are not met. If a learner is hungry (physiological), their  focus of perceptions (attention) will not be on the instructor and the subject being presented. Rather, it will be on satisfying the  physiological need as soon as possible. The same can be said about an anxious learner attempting a fully-developed stall for the first  time.    the   learner   feels   unsafe   (safety   and   security),   their   focus   of   perception    on   their   “flee”   response   and   not   the   skill that the  learner it trying to acquire. However, what is important here is the focus of perceptions, and the ability of the instructor to concentrate  the learner’s   senses on   the subject being   presented.  

![](images/0f0b76948ac2c6471729499e15c14850a319fdef478532ec560133cda258cbe4.jpg)  
Figure 2-3.  Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.  

Many learners are able to complete a maneuver or demonstrate knowledge while being hungry or thirsty, which means that for the  most part, the entire need does not have to be fulfilled to 100 percent. What needs to be addressed is whether parts of each level have  been met, which allows the focus of perception to be concentrated on the instruction given. It does not matter which order the needs  are   met,   the   order   has   little   to   no   effect   on   the   learner’s   learning   ability.   What matters    that the instructor   verifies that most of the  needs   has been   met (law   of   readiness)   and    then   able to   focus   the learner’s   senses (perception)   on   the lesson.  

One of the main responsibilities of an aviation instructor is to help learners learn, which encompasses the law of readiness. To satisfy  the law   of   readiness,   an   instructor   can   verify   that a learner’s   needs   have been   met by   conducting   a thorough   pre-assessment prior to  beginning the lesson. The pre-assessment should verify whether the learner is physically and mentally ready to learn.  

# Meeting Human Needs to Encourage Learning  

# Physiological  

These are biological needs. They consist of the need for air, food, water, and maintenance of the human body. If a learner is unwell,  then little else matters. Unless the biological needs are met, a person cannot concentrate fully on learning, self-expression, or any  other tasks. Instructors should monitor their learners to make sure that their basic physical needs have been met. A hungry or tired  learner may not be able to perform as expected.  

# Security  

Once the physiological needs are met, the need for security becomes active. All humans have a need to feel safe. Security needs are  about keeping oneself from harm. If a learner does not feel safe, he or she cannot concentrate. The aviation instructor who  stresses flight safety during training mitigates feelings of insecurity. A flight instructor should be aware of his learner’s fear of certain  flight regions and ease them into those situations carefully.  

# Belonging  

When individuals are physically comfortable and do not feel threatened, they seek to satisfy their social needs of belonging. Maslow  states that people seek to overcome feelings of loneliness and alienation. This involves both giving and receiving love, affection, and  the sense of belonging. For example, aviation learners are usually out of their normal surroundings during training, and their need for  association and belonging is more pronounced. Instructors should make every effort to help new learners feel at ease and to reinforce  their decision to pursue a career or hobby in aviation.  

# Esteem  

When the first three classes of needs are satisfied, the need for esteem can become dominant. Humans have a need for a stable, firmly  based, high level of self-respect and   respect from   others.   Esteem    about feeling   good   about one’s   self.   Humans   get esteem   in   two   ways: internally or externally. Internally, a person judges himself or herself worthy by personally defined standards. High self-esteem  results in self-confidence, independence, achievement, competence, and knowledge.  

Most people, however, seek external esteem through social approval and esteem from other people, judging themselves by what  others think of them. External self-esteem   relates   to   one’s   reputation,   such   as status,   recognition,   appreciation,   and   respect of associates.  

When esteem needs are satisfied, a person feels self-confident and valuable as a person in the world. When these needs are frustrated,  the person feels inferior, weak, helpless, and worthless. Esteem needs not only have a strong influence on the instructor-learner  relationship,   but also   may   be the main   reason   for   a learner’s   interest in   aviation   training.  

# Cognitive and Aesthetic  

In later years, Maslow added cognitive (need to know and understand) and aesthetic (the emotional need of the artist) needs to the  pyramid. He realized humans have a deep need to understand what is going on around them. If a person understands what is going on,  he or she can either control the situation or make informed choices about what steps might be taken next. The brain even reinforces  this   need   by   giving   humans   a rush   of   dopamine whenever   something    learned,   which   accounts   for   that satisfying   “eureka!” moment.  For   example,   a flight learner   usually   experiences   a major   “eureka!” moment upon   completing   the first solo   flight.  

Aesthetic needs connect directly with human emotions, which makes it a subtle factor in the domain of persuasion. When someone  likes another person, a house, a painting, or a song, the reasons are not examined—he or she simply likes it. This need can factor into  the learner-instructor relationship. If an instructor does not “like”   a learner, this subtle feeling may affect the instructor’s ability to  teach.  

# Self-Actualization  

When all of the foregoing needs are satisfied, then and only then are the needs for self-actualization activated. Maslow describes self- actualization   as a person’s   need   to   be and   do   that which   the person   was “born   to   do.” To   paraphrase an   old   Army   recruiting   slogan,  self-actualization     “be all you   can   be.”  

Self-actualized people are characterized by:  

⦁  Being problem-focused.  ⦁  Incorporating an ongoing freshness of appreciation of life.  ⦁  A concern about personal growth.  ⦁  The ability to have peak experiences.  

Helping a learner achieve his or her individual potential in aviation training offers the greatest challenge as well as reward to the  instructor.  

Instructors should help learners satisfy their human needs in a manner that creates a healthy learning environment. In this type of  environment, learners experience fewer frustrations and, therefore, can devote more attention to their studies. Fulfillment of needs can  be a powerful motivation in complex learning situations.  

# Human Nature and Motivation  

Human nature refers to the general psychological characteristics, feelings, and behavioral traits shared by all humans. Consider Jason,  who came to aviation because he wanted to participate more actively in another realm of his business. Derek needs to capitalize on  this motivation to keep Jason interested in the step-by-step procedures that need to be learned in order to fly safely. There is a gap  between   Jason   and   his   goal of   earning   a pilot certificate.   It is   Derek’s   job   to   close the gap.   The successful instructor   channels learner  motivation and guides the learner toward the goal of obtaining aviation skills through education, experience, practice, and study.  

The psychologist and Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Daniel Kahneman, summarized his findings of human behavior in his book  titled,  Thinking, Fast and Slow . Simply, he outlines that two systems of thought constantly compete for control over our behaviors  that affect decision-making. The first system (fast) is the automatic reaction that individuals have developed through memory and  experience. The second system (slow) relies on logic and reasoning to draw conclusions for the actions one takes.  [Figure 2-4]  

![](images/5b0c0fa92e3843bef171aafbac5f5fce992c8768629bd81a0de313d423cbec0c.jpg)  
Figure 2-4.  Daniel Kahneman developed a two-system view of human behaviors that affect decision-making: System 1 (fast)  represents the automatic responses, while System 2 (slow) represents the more logical and deliberate considerations used for  decision-making.  

According   to   Kahneman's   research,   System    is   primarily   based   in   emotion   and   the unconscious   mind.   These are automatic “gut  reactions” that require little thought or   effort by   the individual.   For   example,   when   presented   with   the simple math   equation   2 + 2 = x,  the individual can easily solve the problem where x = 4. The response is instant and likely correct in this example. The inherent risk  in using this thought system is that, as Kahneman explains, we are inherently lazy. It is exhausting to put forth the effort required to  deliberately concentrate on a problem, especially one that appears to be so easy. This can lead to poor decision-making due to the  assumption that the task at hand is as simple as past, similar, experiences suggest it to be.  

In contrast, individuals rely on System 2 less frequently as it requires conscious effort to calculate and reason through a problem, and  because of this System 2 is comparatively slower than System 1. While someone can easily solve the equation 2 + 2 = x, the average  person needs to pause and consider an answer if presented with a more difficult problem such as 48 × 76 = y. This system demands  considerable effort and self-control of the individual and as a result, it is tempting to revert to the relative ease of System 1. In fact,  once the immediate problem is solved, System 1 takes over again.  

Understanding how these systems affect our decision-making can help instructors be more aware of learner pitfalls, such as assuming  a complex problem is a simple one, or assuming that because a recent task led to a solution that the same solution can be used  correctly for a similar task.  

Since it is human nature to be motivated, the responsibility for discovering how to realize the potential of the learner lies with the  instructor.   How   to   mold   a solid,   healthy,   productive relationship   with   a learner   depends   on   the instructor’s   knowledge of   human  behavior and needs. Being able to recognize factors that inhibit the learning process also helps the instructor in this process.  

# Defense Mechanisms  

Defense mechanisms can be biological or psychological. The biological defense mechanism is a physiological response that protects  or   preserves organisms.   For   example,   when   humans   experience   a danger   or   a threat, the “fight or   flight” response kicks   in.   Adrenaline  and other chemicals are activated and physical symptoms such as rapid heart rate and increased blood pressure occur.  

For example, when an anxious learner pilot reacts to impending and full stalls during practice, the anxiety that the learner pilot may  feel may   resolve itself   into   a “fight or   flight” response.   There may   be limited   time to   analyze   the problem.   Therefore,   the learner  needs the opportunity to experience and develop a comfort level that mitigates the anxiety.  

The instructor   needs   to   recognize the learner’s   apprehension   about performing   the recovery   techniques and   help   them   gain   the  necessary skill level to feel comfortable with the maneuver. In this case, the instructor could take the procedure apart and demonstrate  each stage of an impending or full stall. Allowing the learner to then practice the stages in various realistic scenarios should instill the  confidence needed to master the stall recovery.  

Sigmund Freud introduced the psychological concept of the ego defense mechanism in 1894. The ego defense mechanism is an  unconscious mental process to protect oneself from anxiety, unpleasant emotions, or to provide a refuge from a situation with which  the individual cannot currently cope. For example, someone who blots out the memory of being physically assaulted is using a  defense mechanism. People use these defenses to prevent unacceptable ideas or impulses from entering the conscious mind. Defense  mechanisms   soften   feelings   of   failure,   alleviate feelings   of   guilt, help   an   individual cope with   reality,   and   protect one’s   self-image.  [Figure 2-5]  

When anxiety occurs, the mind tries to solve the problem or find an escape, but if these tactics do not work, defense mechanisms are  triggered. Defense mechanisms share two common properties:  

⦁  They often appear unconsciously.  

⦁  They tend to distort, transform, or otherwise falsify reality.  

Because reality is distorted, perception changes, which allows for a lessening of anxiety, with a corresponding reduction in tension.  Repression and denial are two primary defense mechanisms.  

# Repression  

Repression is the defense mechanism whereby a person places uncomfortable thoughts into inaccessible areas of the unconscious  mind. Things a person is unable to cope with now are pushed away, to be dealt with at another time, or hopefully never because they  faded away on their own accord. The level of repression can vary from temporarily forgetting an uncomfortable thought to amnesia,  where the events that triggered the anxiety are deeply buried. Repressed memories do not disappear and may reappear in dreams or  slips   of   the tongue (“Freudian   slips”).   For   example,   a learner   pilot may   have a repressed   fear   of   flying   that inhibits   his   or   her ability to  learn how to fly.  

# Denial  

Denial is a refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening. It is the refusal to acknowledge what has happened, is  happening, or will happen. It is a form of repression through which stressful thoughts are banned from memory. Related to denial is  minimization. When a person minimizes something, he or she accepts what happened, but in a diluted form.  

For example, the instructor finds a water bottle under the rudder pedal of an aircraft the student took on a solo flight and explains the  hazards of loose objects in the cabin. The learner, unwilling to accept the reality that his or her inattention could have caused an  aircraft accident, denies having been inattentive on previous day. Or, the learner minimizes the incident, accepting he or she left the  water bottle pointing out that nothing bad happened as a result of the action.

Figure 2-5.  Several common defense mechanisms may apply to aviation learners.  

Other defense mechanisms include but are not limited to the following:  

# Compensation  

Compensation is a process of psychologically counterbalancing perceived weaknesses by emphasizing strength in other areas.  Through compensation, learners often attempt to disguise the presence of a weak or undesirable quality by emphasizing a more  positive one.   The “I’m   not a fighter,   I’m   a lover” philosophy   can   be an   example of   compensation.   Compensation   involves substituting  success in a realm of life other than the realm in which the person suffers a weakness.  

# Projection  

Through projection, an individual places his or her own unacceptable impulses onto someone else. A person relegates the blame for  personal shortcomings, mistakes, and transgressions to others or attributes personal motives, desires, characteristics, and impulses to  others.   The learner   pilot who   fails   a flight exam   and   says,    failed   because I   had   a poor   examiner” believes the failure was   not due to  a lack   of   personal skill or   knowledge.   This   learner   projects   blame onto   an   “unfair” examiner.  

Learners who believe their instruction is inadequate, or that their efforts are not conscientiously considered and evaluated, do not  learn well. In addition, their motivation suffers no matter how intent they are on learning to fly. Motivation also declines when a  learner believes the instructor is making unreasonable demands for performance and progress.  [Figure 2-6]  

Assignment of difficult, but possible, goals usually provides a challenge and promotes learning. In a typical flight lesson, reasonable  goals are listed in the lesson objectives and the desired levels of proficiency for the goals are included in statements that contain  completion standards.  

# Rationalization  

Rationalization is a subconscious technique for justifying actions that otherwise would be unacceptable. When true rationalization  takes place, individuals sincerely believe in the plausible and acceptable excuses which seem real and justifiable. For example, a  learner mechanic performs poorly on a test. He or she may justify the poor grade by claiming there was not enough time to learn the  required information. The learner does not admit to failing to join the class study group or taking the computer quiz offered by the  instructor.  

# Reaction Formation  

In reaction formation a person fakes a belief opposite to the true belief because the true belief causes anxiety. The person feels an  urge to do or say something and then actually does or says something that is the opposite of what he or she really wants. For example,  a learner may develop a who-cares-how-other-people-feel attitude to cover up feelings of loneliness and a hunger for acceptance.  

![](images/bacb2f13f7e2f51fa223b2d3b04ebd8d671e964034103359159a8e0397636a7f.jpg)  
Figure 2-6.  The assignment of impossible or unreasonable goals discourages the learner, diminishes effort, and retards the learning  process.  

# Fantasy  

Fantasy occurs when a learner engages in daydreams about how things should be rather than doing anything about how things are.  The learner uses his or her imagination to escape from reality into a fictitious world—a world of success or pleasure. However, if a  learner gets sufficient satisfaction from daydreaming, he or she may stop trying to achieve goals altogether. Perhaps the transitioning  pilot is having trouble mastering a more complex aircraft, which jeopardizes his or her dream of becoming an airline pilot. It becomes  easier to daydream about the career than to achieve the certification. Lost in the fantasy, the learner spends more time dreaming about  being a successful airline pilot than working toward the goal. When carried to extremes, the worlds of fantasy and reality can become  so confused that the dreamer cannot distinguish one from the other.  

# Displacement  

This defense mechanism results in an unconscious shift of emotion, affect, or desire from the original object to a more acceptable,  less threatening substitute. Displacement avoids the risk associated with feeling unpleasant emotions and puts them somewhere other  than where they belong. For example, the avionics learner is angry with the instructor over a grade received but fears displaying the  anger could antagonize the instructor. The learner might choose to direct the anger towards a different object without risking  consequences related to the class.  

Psychology textbooks or online references offer more in-depth information about defense mechanisms. While most defense  mechanisms fall within the realm of normal behavior and serve a useful purpose, in some cases they may be associated with mental  health problems. Defense mechanisms involve some degree of self-deception and distortion of reality. Thus, they alleviate the  symptoms, not the causes, and do not solve problems. Moreover, because defense mechanisms operate on an unconscious level, they  are not subject to normal conscious checks and balances. Once an individual realizes there is a conscious reliance on one of these  devices, behavior ceases to be an unconscious adjustment mechanism and becomes, instead, an ineffective way of satisfying a need.  

It may be difficult for an instructor to identify excessive reliance on defense mechanisms by a learner, but a personal crisis or other  stressful event is usually the cause. For example, a death in the family, a divorce, or even a failing grade on an important test may  trigger harmful defensive reactions. Physical symptoms such as a change in personality, angry outbursts, depression, or a general lack  of interest may point to a problem. Drug or alcohol abuse also may become apparent. Less obvious indications may include social  withdrawal, preoccupation with certain ideas, or an inability to concentrate.  

An instructor needs to be familiar with typical defense mechanisms and have some knowledge of related behavioral problems. A  perceptive instructor can help by using common sense and discussing the problem with the learner. The main objective should be to  restore motivation and self-confidence. It should be noted that the human psyche is fragile and could be damaged by inept measures.  Therefore, in severe cases involving the possibility of deep psychological problems, timely and skillful help is needed. In this event,  the instructor should recommend that the learner use the services of a professional counselor.  

# Learner Emotional Reactions  

While it is not necessary for a flight instructor to be a certified psychologist, it is helpful to learn how to analyze learner behavior  before and during each flight lesson. This ability helps a flight instructor develop and use appropriate techniques for instruction yet to  occur.  

# Anxiety  

Anxiety is probably the most significant psychological factor affecting flight instruction. This is true because flying is a potentially  threatening experience for those who are not accustomed to flying and the fear of falling is universal in human beings. While anxiety  is a factor associated with aviation activities where lives depend on consistently doing the job right, the following paragraphs are  primarily concerned with instruction and learner reactions.  

Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something that is going to happen, typically something with an  uncertain outcome. It results from the fear of anything, real or imagined, which threatens the person who experiences it, and may have  a potent effect on actions and the ability to learn from perceptions.  

The responses to   anxiety   range from   a hesitancy   to   act to   the impulse to   do   something   even    it’s   wrong.   Some people affected by  anxiety react appropriately, adequately, and more rapidly than they would in the absence of threat. Many, on the other hand, may  freeze and be incapable of doing anything to correct the situation that has caused their anxiety. Others may do things without rational  thought or reason.  

Both normal and abnormal reactions to anxiety are of concern to the flight instructor. The normal reactions are significant because  they indicate a need for special instruction to relieve the anxiety. The abnormal reactions are even more important because they may  signify a deep-seated problem.  

Anxiety   can   be countered   by   reinforcing   the learners’   enjoyment of   flying   and   by   teaching   them   to   cope with   their   fears.   An   effective  technique is to treat fears as a normal reaction, rather than ignoring them. Keep in mind that anxiety for learner pilots is usually  associated with certain types of flight operations and maneuvers. Instructors should introduce these maneuvers with care, so that  learners know what to expect and what their reactions should be. When introducing stalls, for example, instructors should first review  the aerodynamic principles and explain how stalls affect flight characteristics. Then, carefully describe the physical sensations to be  expected, as well as the recovery procedures.  

Learner anxiety can be minimized throughout training by emphasizing the benefits and pleasurable experiences that can be derived  from flying, rather than by continuously citing the unhappy consequences of faulty performances. Safe flying practices should be  presented as conducive to satisfying, efficient, uninterrupted operations, rather than as necessary only to prevent catastrophe.  

# Impatience  

Impatience is a greater deterrent to learning pilot skills than is generally recognized. For a learner, this may take the form of a desire  to make an early solo flight, or to set out on cross-country flights before the basic elements of flight have been learned.  

The impatient learner fails to understand the need for preliminary training and seeks only the ultimate objective without considering  the means necessary to reach it. With every complex human endeavor, it is necessary to master the basics if the whole task is to be  performed competently and safely. The instructor can correct learner impatience by presenting the necessary preliminary training one  step at a time, with clearly stated goals for each step. The procedures and elements mastered in each step should be clearly identified  when explaining or demonstrating the performance of the subsequent step.  

Impatience can result from instruction keyed to the pace of a slow learner when it is applied to a motivated, fast learner. It is just as  important that a learner be advanced to the subsequent step as soon as one goal has been attained, as it is to complete each step before  the next one is undertaken. Disinterest grows rapidly when unnecessary repetition and drill are requested on operations that have  already been adequately learned.  

# Worry or Lack of Interest  

Worry or lack of interest has a detrimental effect on learning. Learners who are worried or emotionally upset are not ready to learn  and derive little benefit from instruction. Worry or distraction may be due to learner concerns about progress in the training course, or  may stem from circumstances completely unrelated to their instruction. Significant emotional upsets may be due to personal  problems, emotional problems, or a dislike of the training program or the instructor.  

The experiences of learners outside their training activities affect behavior and performance in training; the two cannot be separated.  When learners begin flight training, they bring with them their interests, enthusiasms, fears, and troubles. The instructor cannot be  responsible for these outside diversions, but cannot ignore them because they have a critical effect on the learning process. Instruction  should be keyed to the utilization of the interests and enthusiasm learners bring with them, and to diverting their attention from their  worries and troubles to learning the tasks at hand. This is admittedly difficult, but needs to be accomplished if learning is to proceed  at a normal rate.  

Worries and emotional upsets that result from a flight training course can be identified and addressed. These problems are often due  to inadequacies of the course or of the instructor. The most effective cure is prevention. The instructor should be alert and ensure the  learners understand the objectives of each step of their training, and that they know at the completion of each lesson exactly how well  they have progressed and what deficiencies are apparent. Discouragement and emotional upsets are rare when learners feel that  nothing is being withheld from them or is being neglected in their training.  

# Physical Discomfort, Illness, Fatigue, and Dehydration  

Physical discomfort, illness, and fatigue will slow the rate of learning during both classroom instruction and flight training. Learners  who are not completely at ease, and whose attention is diverted by discomforts such as the extremes of temperature, poor ventilation,  inadequate lighting, or noise and confusion, cannot learn at a normal rate. This is true no matter how diligently they attempt to apply  themselves to the learning task.  

A minor illness such as a cold, or a major illness or injury interferes with the normal rate of learning. This is especially important for  flight instruction. Most illnesses adversely affect the acuteness of vision, hearing, and feeling, all of which are essential to correct  performance.  

Airsickness can be a great deterrent to flight instruction. A learner who is airsick or bothered with incipient airsickness is incapable of  learning at a normal rate. There is no sure cure for airsickness, but resistance or immunity usually can be developed in a relatively  short period of time. An instructional flight should be terminated as soon as incipient sickness is experienced. As the learner develops  immunity, flights can be increased in length until normal flight periods are practicable.  

Keeping learners interested and occupied during flight is a deterrent to airsickness. They are much less apt to become airsick while  operating the controls themselves. Blowing fresh air across the face also helps reduce symptoms of incipient sickness. Rough air and  unexpected abrupt maneuvers tend to increase the chances of airsickness. Tension and apprehension contribute to airsickness and  should be avoided.  

# Fatigue  

Fatigue is one of the most treacherous hazards to flight safety as it may not be apparent to a pilot until serious errors are made.  Fatigue can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Acute fatigue, a normal occurrence of everyday living, is the tiredness  felt after long periods of physical and mental strain, including strenuous muscular effort, immobility, heavy mental workload, strong  emotional pressure, monotony, or lack of sleep.  

Acute fatigue caused by training operations may be physical or mental, or both. It is not necessarily a function of physical strength or  mental acuity. The amount of training any learner can absorb without incurring debilitating fatigue varies. Generally speaking,  complex operations tend to induce fatigue more rapidly than simpler procedures do, regardless of the physical effort involved.  Fatigue is the primary consideration in determining the length and frequency of flight instruction periods and flight instruction should  be continued only as long as the learner is alert, receptive to instruction, and is performing at a level consistent with experience.  

It is important for a  flight instructor   to be able to detect fatigue, both in assessing a learner’s substandard performance early in a  lesson, and also in recognizing the deterioration of performance. If fatigue occurs as a result of application to a learning task, the  learner should be given a break in instruction and practice.  

A  flight instructor   who is familiar with the signs indicative to acute fatigue will be more aware if the learner is  experiencing them. The deficiencies listed below are apparent to others before the individual notices any physical signs of fatigue.  

⦁  Inattention  ⦁  Distractibility  ⦁  Errors in timing  ⦁  Neglect of secondary tasks  ⦁  Loss of accuracy and control  ⦁  Lack of awareness of error accumulation  ⦁  Irritability  

Another form of fatigue is chronic fatigue which occurs when there is not enough time for a full recovery from repeated episodes of  acute fatigue.   Chronic fatigue’s   underlying   cause is   generally   not “rest-related” and   may   have deeper   points   of   origin.   Therefore,   rest  alone may not resolve chronic fatigue.  

Chronic fatigue is a combination of both physiological problems and psychological issues. Psychological problems such as financial,  home life, or job-related stresses cause a lack of qualified rest that is only solved by mitigating the underlying problems before the  fatigue is solved. Without resolution, human performance continues to deteriorate, and judgment becomes impaired so that  unwarranted risks may be taken. Recovery from chronic fatigue requires a prolonged and deliberate solution. In either case, unless  adequate precautions are taken, personal performance could be impaired and adversely affect pilot judgment and decision-making.  

# Dehydration and Heatstroke  

Dehydration    the term   given   to   a critical loss   of   water   from   the body.   Dehydration   reduces   a pilot’s   level of   alertness,   producing a  subsequent slowing of decision-making processes or even the inability to control the aircraft. The first noticeable effect of  dehydration is fatigue, which in turn makes top physical and mental performance difficult, if not impossible. Flying for long periods  in hot summer temperatures or at high altitudes increases susceptibility to dehydration. High altitude is an issue since dry air at high  altitudes tends to increase the rate of water loss from the body. If this fluid is not replaced, fatigue progresses to dizziness, weakness,  nausea, tingling of hands and feet, abdominal cramps, and extreme thirst.  

Heatstroke is a condition caused by any inability of the body to control its temperature. Onset of this condition may be recognized by  the symptoms of dehydration, but its recognition may occur too late if it results in a sudden complete collapse. To prevent these  symptoms, it is recommended that an ample supply of water be carried and used at frequent intervals on any long flight, whether the  pilot is thirsty or not. If the airplane has a canopy or roof window, wearing light-colored, porous clothing and a hat helps provide  protection from the sun. Keeping the flight deck well ventilated aids in dissipating excess heat.  

# Apathy Due to Inadequate Instruction  

Learners can become apathetic when they recognize that the instructor has made inadequate preparations for the instruction being  given,   or   when   the   instruction   appears   to   be   deficient,   contradictory,   or   insincere.   To   hold   the   learner’s   interest   and   to   maintain the  motivation necessary for efficient learning, instructors should provide well-planned, appropriate, and accurate instruction. Nothing  destroys   a learner’s   interest   as quickly   as a poorly   organized   period   of   instruction.   Even   an   inexperienced   learner   realizes  immediately when the instructor has failed to prepare a lesson.  [Figure 2-7]  

Instruction may be overly explicit and complicated, too elementary, or so general that it fails to evoke the interest necessary for  effective learning. To be effective, the instructor teaches for the level of the learner. The presentation should be adjusted to be  meaningful to the person for whom it is intended. For example, instruction in the preflight inspection of an aircraft should be  presented quite differently for a learner who is a skilled aircraft maintenance technician (AMT) compared to the instruction on the  same operation for a learner with no previous aeronautical experience. The instruction needed in each case is the same but a  presentation meaningful to one of these learners might not be appropriate for the other.  

Poor instructional presentations may result not only from poor preparation, but also from distracting mannerisms, personal untidiness,  or the appearance of irritation with the learner. Creating the impression of talking down to the learner is one of the fastest ways for an  instructor to lose learner confidence and attention. Once the instructor loses learner confidence, it is difficult to regain, and the  learning rate is unnecessarily diminished.  

![](images/e235a6354e6daacceab76c4d7e038efa70e81b142cb8a832723d1e4582d9cf99.jpg)  
Figure 2-7.  Poor preparation leads to spotty coverage, misplaced emphasis, unnecessary repetition, and a lack of confidence on the  part of the learner. The instructor should always have a plan.  

# Normal Reactions to Stress  

As mentioned earlier in the chapter, when a threat is recognized or imagined, the brain alerts the body. The adrenal gland activates  hormones, which prepare the body to meet the threat or to retreat from it—the fight or flight syndrome.  

Normal individuals begin to respond rapidly and exactly, within the limits of their experience and training. Many responses are  automatic, highlighting the need for proper training in emergency operations prior to an actual emergency. The affected individual  thinks rationally, acts rapidly, and is extremely sensitive to all aspects of the surroundings.  

# Abnormal Reactions to Stress  

Reactions to stress may produce abnormal responses in some people. With them, response to anxiety or stress may be completely  absent or at least inadequate. Their responses may be random or illogical, or they may do more than is called for by the situation.  

During flight instruction, instructors are normally the only ones who can observe learners when they are under pressure. Instructors,  therefore, are in a position to differentiate between safe and unsafe piloting actions. Instructors also may be able to detect potential  psychological problems. The following learner reactions are indicative of abnormal reactions to stress. None of them provides an  absolute indication, but the presence of any of them under conditions of stress is reason for careful instructor evaluation.  

⦁  Inappropriate reactions, such as extreme over-cooperation, painstaking self-control, inappropriate      laughter or singing, and very rapid changes in emotions.  ⦁  Marked changes in mood on different lessons, such as excellent morale followed by deep depression.  ⦁  Severe anger directed toward the flight instructor, service personnel, and others.  

In difficult situations, flight instructors should carefully examine learner responses and their own responses to the learners. These  responses may be the normal products of a complex learning situation but they also can be indicative of psychological abnormalities  that inhibit learning or are potentially very hazardous to future piloting operations.  [Figure 2-8]  

# Flight Instructor Actions Regarding Seriously Abnormal Learners  

A flight instructor who believes a learner may be suffering from a serious psychological abnormality has a responsibility to refrain  from instructing that learner. In addition, a flight instructor has the personal responsibility of assuring that such a person does not  continue flight training or become certificated as a pilot. To accomplish this, the following steps are available:  

⦁  If an instructor believes that a learner may have a disqualifying psychological defect, arrangements     should be made for another instructor, who is not acquainted with the learner, to conduct an     evaluation flight. After the flight, the two instructors should confer to determine whether they agree     that further investigation or action is justified.  ⦁  The flight instructor’s   primary   legal responsibility   concerns   the decision   whether    endorse the      learner to be competent for solo flight operations, or to make a recommendation for the practical test      leading to certification as a pilot. If, after consultation with an unbiased instructor, the instructor      believes that the learner may have a serious psychological deficiency, such endorsements and      recommendations should be withheld.  

![](images/92fc5f785dba3b09ed314ff08a75c1dfa6c280a054eb35ae9fce4227a9119166.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.  A learner with marked changes in mood during different lessons, such as excellent morale followed by deep depression, is  indicative of an abnormal reaction to stress.  

# AMTs and Flight Instructors as Learners  

Both AMTs and flight instructors sometimes deal with new or unfamiliar technology. For instance, an instructor flying a different  aircraft may have to manage a particular system or avionics suite for the first time. Likewise, the AMT who is accustomed to working  with one type of aircraft has developed analytical processes that may not transfer to another aircraft as well as expected. In both cases,  the instructors may be very highly experienced, but change and its associated stress may have risk consequences.  

Technological advances in aircraft, powerplants, and systems can outpace the knowledge of flight instructors and AMTs if they don’t  ensure they remain adequately trained. This ongoing training may remind instructors of their own tendencies to become  vulnerable and less objective. By under s tanding their own training, instructors gain the insight to direct learners to think rationally  and overcome stress. Instructors should understand that their own actions and care for others during the training they provide can  frame the way a learner responds well into the future.  

Diminishing   stress   and   strengthening   a learner’s   confidence   and   decision-making skills can be achieved by incorporating a risk  assessment tool into a training program. Risk assessment tools should always be used to help determine the level of risk involved with  any flight so that the pilot or other support person maintains a margin of safety in the activity they are involved. Key to any risk  assessment is the individual’s   objectivity    ensure safety   during   their   flight.  

# Teaching the Adult Learner  

While aviation instructors teach learners of all ages, the average aviation learner age is 30 years old. This means the aviation  instructor needs to be versed in the needs of adult learners. The field of adult education is relatively young, having been established in  the late twentieth century by Dr. Malcolm Knowles. His research revealed certain traits that need to be recognized when teaching  adult learners as well as ways instructors can use these traits to teach older learners.  

Adults as learners possess the following characteristics:  

⦁  Adults who are motivated to seek out a learning experience do so primarily because they have a use for the      knowledge or skill being sought. Learning is a means to an end, not an end in itself.   $\circ$    Adults seek out learning experiences in order to cope with specific life-changing events—marriage,      divorce, a new job. They are ready to learn when they assume new roles.  ⦁  Adults are autonomous and self-directed; they need to be independent and exercise control.  ⦁  Adults have accumulated a foundation of life experiences and knowledge and draw upon this reservoir of      experience for learning.  ⦁  Adults are goal-oriented.  ⦁  Adults are relevancy oriented. Their time perspective changes from one of postponed knowledge      application to immediate application.  ⦁  Adults are practical, focusing on the aspects of a lesson most useful to them in their work.  ⦁  As do all learners, adults need to be shown respect.  ⦁  The need to increase or maintain a sense of self-esteem is a strong secondary motivator for adult learners  ⦁  Adults want to solve problems and apply new knowledge immediately.  

Instructors should:  

⦁  Provide a training syllabus (see Chapter 7, Planning Instructional Activity) that is organized with clearly      defined course objectives to show the learner how the training helps him or her attain specific goals.  ⦁  Help learners integrate new ideas with what they already know to ensure they keep and use the new      information.  ⦁  Assume responsibility only for his or her own expectations, not for those of learners. It is important to      clarify and articulate all learner expectations early on.  ⦁  Recognize the learner’s   need    control pace and   start/stop   time.   ⦁  Take advantage of the adult preference to self-direct and self-design learning projects by giving the learner      frequent scenario based training (SBT) opportunities  ⦁  Remember that self-direction does not mean isolation. Studies of self-directed learning indicate self-     directed projects involve other people as resources, guides, etc.  ⦁  Use books, programmed instruction, and computers which are popular with adult learners.  

⦁  Set a cooperative learning climate.  ⦁  Create opportunities for mutual planning.  

An aviation learner may be the retired business executive who always wanted to learn how to fly, an Army helicopter pilot who wants  to learn how to fly an airplane, or a former automobile mechanic who decides to pursue avionics. These learners may be financially  stressed, or they may be financially secure. They may be healthy but they may be experiencing such age-related problems as  diminished hearing or eyesight. Whatever the personal circumstances of the learner, he or she wants the learning experience to be  problem-oriented,   personalized,   and   the instructor    be accepting   of   the learner’s   need   for   self-direction and personal responsibility.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discussed how human behavior affects learning, the effect of human needs on learning, defense mechanisms learners use  to   prevent learning,   how   adults   learn,   and   the flight instructor’s   role in   determining   a learner’s   future in   the aviation   community. For  more information on these topics, it is recommended the instructor read a general educational psychology text or visit one of the many  online sites devoted to education.  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 3: The Learning Process  

# Introduction  The First Flight  

When Beverly (learner) enthusiastically presents herself for her first day of flight instruction, Bill, her  f light  i nstructor, decides  to spend some time in the classroom. Beverly knows a lot of facts about flying and shares her knowledge with Bill, but when he asks  questions to test her understanding of the facts, she cannot answer them. During their first flight, Bill discovers Beverly has mastered  a few basic skills but her performance is awkward, as if she were working from a list of memorized steps.  

In the early stages of flight training, Beverly focuses all her attention on performing each skill. If Bill asks her a question or to  perform two tasks at once, she loses her place and needs to restart. As she flies, she makes errors. When she catches herself making  an error she becomes visibly frustrated. Then sometimes she does not notice an error and keeps moving ahead as if nothing were  amiss. Since she is a beginner, Bill is patient.  

# The Check Ride  

Months later, Bill is helping Beverly prepare for her practical test. Remembering her first days of instruction, Bill feels as if he were  working with a different person. The breadth and depth of her classroom knowledge has grown. Beverly does not simply reiterate  facts—she applies her knowledge to solve the problems Bill gives her. In addition to meeting all the elements listed in the Airmen  Certification Standards (ACS), she also knows about her local environment, such as the nuances of local weather patterns.  

In the aircraft, once awkward and tentative actions are now performed with a steady hand and confidence. Skills she struggled to learn  in the past have become second nature. When asked to do several things simultaneously, she performs well. When Bill interrupts her,  she mentally bookmarks where she is, contends with the interruption and then returns to the task at hand. She still makes errors, but  they are small ones that she notices and corrects right away. She still gets frustrated when she makes an error, but she takes a deep  breath,   and   continues on   her   way.   She makes flying   look   easy   and   Bill is   confident that tomorrow’s   meeting   with   the evaluator   will go  well.  

# Analysis of the First Flight and Check Ride  

Between Beverly’s first day of training and the day before her practical test, she has undergone some remarkable changes:  

1. She has developed a collection of memorized facts into an in-depth understanding of how to fly and  learned to apply this knowledge to problem-solving and decision-making.  2. Skills once performed awkwardly and deliberately are now performed smoothly and efficiently.  3. She comfortably performs several tasks at once, deals with distractions and interruptions, and maintains  her focus in demanding situations. Knowledge and skills are now orchestrated.  4. She still makes errors, but they are less frequent, smaller in magnitude, and she quickly identifies and  corrects them.  5. Her motivation and enthusiasm remain as high as they were on the first day of training.  6. She displays proficiency in all areas now: those at which she naturally excels as well as those she struggled  to master in the past.  7. She deals with psychological obstacles, such as frustration, that initially got in the way of her learning.  8. She recognizes the importance of regular study and practice.  

This scenario illustrates the goal of an aviation instructor: to teach each learner in such a way that he or she will become a competent  pilot or aviation maintenance technician (AMT). In order to take a pilot or AMT from memorized facts to higher levels of knowledge  and skill that include the ability to exercise judgment and solve problems, an instructor needs to know how people learn. Designed as  a basic guide in applied educational psychology, this chapter addresses how people learn.  

# What is Learning?  

Learning can be defined in many ways:  

⦁  A change in the behavior of the learner as a result of experience. The behavior can be physical and overt, or      it can be intellectual or attitudinal.  ⦁  The process by which experience brings about a relatively permanent change in behavior.  ⦁  The change in behavior that results from experience and practice.  ⦁  Gaining knowledge or skills, or developing a behavior, through study, instruction, or experience.  ⦁  The process of acquiring knowledge or skill through study, experience, or teaching. It depends on  experience and leads to long-term changes in behavior potential. Behavior potential describes the  possible behavior of an individual (not actual behavior) in a given situation in order to achieve a goal.  ⦁  A relatively permanent change in cognition, resulting from experience and directly influencing behavior.  

The effective instructor understands the subject being taught, the learner, the learning process, and the interrelationships that exist. An  effective instructor also realizes learning is a complex procedure and assists each learner in reaching the desired outcomes while  helping build self-esteem and confidence.  [Figure 3-1]

# The Framework for Learning  

Research into how people learn gained momentum with the Swiss scientist and psychologist Jean Piaget, who studied the intellectual  development of children in the early twentieth century. His studies influenced others to research not only how people learn, but also  the best ways to teach them, leading eventually to the establishment of the field of educational psychology.  

# Learning Theory  

Learning theory is a body of principles advocated by psychologists and educators to explain how people acquire skills, knowledge,  and attitudes. Primary learning theories include classical and operant conditioning and social learning.  [Figure 3-2]  

![](images/4ba64beeed6a741e98f940c424ad24afef32522ccb832307ee8f1b371713426b.jpg)  
Figure 3-2.  Learning theories of psychology include classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning.  

Classical conditioning is learning based on an association made between a neutral environmental stimulus and a natural stimulus. For  example, the Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov discovered that a dog could be trained to associate the sound of a beating metronome  with being fed. Pavlov would start the metronome before presenting the dog with food. Over time, the dog learned to associate the  unique sound with receiving food and, as a result, the dog would physically respond to only the sound of the metronome. Today, this  experiment is commonly   referred    as Pavlov’s   Dog.  

Operant conditioning is very similar to classical conditioning in which forming associations is the fundamental tool of learning.  However, in operant conditioning, the association is made between behavior and the consequences of that behavior. In this learning  method, a positive behavior creates a positive consequence; a negative behavior creates a negative consequence. The learner then  makes an association between behaviors and consequences and then predicts that future behaviors will result in similar consequences.  

Social learning is simply learning by observation. Psychologist Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory suggests, basically, that we  all learn from each other. Learning occurs by observing the actions of those around us, imitating those actions, and finally modeling  those actions ourselves that others around us may then observe, effectively perpetuating the learning process through continued social  interactions. Bandura's theory states that there are four stages associated to social learning:  

2. Retention—the ability to remember an observed behavior to later repeat that behavior.  3. Reproduction—the act of producing a previously observed behavior. This may require additional skills  beyond what was initially observed.  4. Motivation—the reason to reproduce an observed behavior.  

Various branches of learning theory are used in formal training programs to improve and accelerate the learning process. Key  concepts such as desired learning outcomes, objectives of the training, and depth of training also apply. When properly integrated,  learning principles can be useful to aviation instructors and developers of instructional programs for both pilots and AMTs.  

Many psychologists and educators have attempted to explain how people learn. While variations abound, modern learning theories  grew out of two concepts of how people learn: behaviorism and cognitive theory.  

# Behaviorism  

Behaviorism explains animal and human behavior entirely in terms of observable and measurable responses to stimuli. Behaviorism  was introduced in the twentieth century and its followers believed all human behavior is conditioned more or less by events in the  environment. Thus, human behavior can be predicted based on past rewards and punishments. Classic behaviorist theory in education  stressed   a system   of   rewards   and   punishment or   the “carrot and   stick” approach    learning.   In   modern   education   circles, behaviorism  stresses the importance of having a particular form of behavior positively reinforced by someone (other than the learner) who shapes  or controls what is learned. In aviation training, the instructor provides the reinforcement.  

Today, behaviorism is now used more to break unwanted behaviors, such as smoking, than in teaching. The popularity of behaviorism  has waned due to research that indicates learning is a much more complex process than a response to stimuli. Humans, far from being  passive products of experience, are always actively interacting with the environment.  

# Cognitive Theory  

Cognitive theory focuses on what is going on inside the mind. It is more concerned with cognition (the process of thinking and  learning)—knowing, perceiving, problem-solving, decision-making, awareness, and related intellectual activities—than with stimulus  and response. Learning is not just a change in behavior; it is a change in the way a learner thinks, understands, or feels. Theories  based on cognition are concerned with the mental events of the learner. Much of the recent psychological thinking and  experimentation in education includes some facets of the cognitive theory.  

Theories of cognitive learning were established by psychologists and educators such as John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Benjamin Bloom,  and Jerome Bruner.  [Figure 3-3]  There have been many interpretations of the research data dealing with cognitive theories. This has  led to many different models for learning as well as some associated catch phrases.  

![](images/8b2e66970724e67740dd08c3dc1e8a033b60028215c7dc1a873447fed56c4e75.jpg)  
Figure 3-3.  Psychologists and educators who established the theories of cognitive learning.  

For   example,   educator,   psychologist, and   philosopher,   John   Dewey   introduced   the concept “reflective thought.”   Dewey   believed   learning improves to the degree that it arises out of the process of reflection. Over the years, terminology describing reflection has  spawned   a host of   synonyms,   such   as “critical thinking,” “problem-solving,” and   “higher   level thought.”  

For Dewey, the concept of reflective thought carried deep meaning. He saw reflection as a process that moves a learner from one  experience into the next with deeper understanding of its relationships with and connections to other experiences and ideas. Thus,  reflection leads the learner from the unclear to the clear.  

Jean Piaget, who spent 50 years studying how children develop intellectually, became a major figure in the school of cognitive  thought. His research led him to conclude there is always tension between assimilation (old ideas meeting new situations) and  accommodation (changing the old ideas to meet the new situations). The resolution of this tension results in intellectual growth. Thus,  humans develop cognitive skills through active interaction with the world (a basic premise of scenario-based training (SBT),  discussed later in this chapter).  

An American psychologist who studied with Piaget, Jerome Bruner became interested in how intellectual development related to the  process of learning. His research led him to advocate learning from the known to the unknown, or from the concrete to the abstract,  because humans best learn when relating new knowledge to existing knowledge. He introduced and developed the concept of the  spiral curriculum, which revisits basic ideas repeatedly and builds on them in increasingly sophisticated ways as the learner matures  and develops.  

Consider the opening scenario with Bill and Beverly. Bill might effectively use this theory with Beverly because she arrived at her  first class with a store of aviation facts. Building upon this knowledge, Bill can teach her how to keep the aircraft in straight and level  flight while he reinforces what she knows about basic aerodynamics via demonstration and discussion. Since aerodynamics is a  constant thread in the flight lessons, Bill is also able to employ the spiral curriculum concept in future lessons by repeatedly revisiting  the basic concepts   and   building   upon   them   as Beverly’s   skill and   knowledge increase.  

A group of educators led by Benjamin Bloom tried to classify the levels of thinking behaviors thought to be important in the  processes of learning.  [Figure 3-4]  They wanted to classify education goals and objectives based on the assumption that abilities can  be measured along a continuum from simple to complex. The result, which remains a popular framework for cognitive theory, was  Bloom’s   Taxonomy   of   the Cognitive Domain.   The taxonomy   (a classification   system   according    presumed   relationships)   comprises  six levels of intellectual behavior and progresses from the simplest to the most complex: knowledge, comprehension, application,  analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. For more detailed information about the taxonomy, see Domains of Learning.  

![](images/25305521f8d9762573ec010a44d12a79c28f9d272e709ff22ef0d05efcb0a450.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.  Bloom’s   Taxonomy of the Cognitive Domain.  

Continued research into cognitive theory has led to theories such as information processing and constructivism. This is the basis of  the organizing a lesson methods discussed in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process.  

# Information Processing Theory  

Information processing theory uses a computer system as a model for human learning. The human brain processes incoming  information, stores and retrieves it and generates responses to the information. This involves a number of cognitive processes:  gathering and representing information (encoding), retaining of information, and retrieving the information when needed.  

This learning system has limitations and needs to be operated properly. A computer gets input from a keyboard, mouse, etc., whereas  the human brain gets input from the senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. The amount of sensory input the brain receives  per second ranges from thousands to millions of bits of information according to various theories. Regardless of the number, that is a  lot of information for the brain to track and process.  

One way the brain deals with all this information is to let many of the habitual and routine things go unnoticed. For example, a pilot  who uses the rudder when entering a turn is usually unaware of pressing the pedal, even though it involves moving a leg, exerting  pressure on the pedal, etc. The human unconscious takes charge, leaving conscious thought processes free to deal with issues that are  not habitual.  

Since information processing theorists approach learning primarily through a study of memory, this learning concept is revisited  during the discussion of memory.  

# Constructivism  

A derivative of cognitive theory, constructivism is a philosophy of learning that holds that learners do not acquire knowledge and  skills passively but actively build or construct them based on their experiences. As implied by its name, constructivism emphasizes  the constructing or building that goes on during the learning process. Therefore, it creates a learner-centered environment in which  they assume responsibility for their own learning.  

According to constructivism, humans construct a unique mental image by combining preexisting information with the information  received from sense organs. Learning is the result of matching new information against this preexisting information and integrating it  into meaningful connections. In constructivist thinking, learners are given more latitude to become effective problem solvers,  identifying and evaluating problems, as well as deciphering ways in which to transfer their learning to these problems, all of which  foster critical thinking skills. While the learner is at the center of the process, an experienced teacher is necessary to guide them  through the information jungle. Constructivism techniques are good for some types of learning, some situations, and some  individuals, but not all. This school of thought also encourages teaching learners how to use what are known as the higher order  thinking   skills   (HOTS) from   Bloom’s   Taxonomy   and   training   based   on   problems   or   scenarios.   Constructivism    the basis   for   several  of the training delivery methods covered in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process.  

# Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)  

The constructivist theory of learning explains and supports the learning of HOTS, which is commonly called aeronautical decision- making   (ADM)   in   aviation.   HOTS lie in   the last   three   levels on   Bloom’s   Taxonomy   of   Learning: analysis,   synthesis,   and   evaluation  skills. Teaching the higher level thinking skills which are essential to judgment, decision-making, and critical thinking is important to  aviation because a common thread in aviation accidents is the absence of higher order thinking skills (see Appendix E).  

HOTS are taught like other cognitive skills, from simple to complex and from concrete to abstract. To teach HOTS effectively  involves strategies and methods that include (1) using problem-based learning (PBL) instruction, (2) authentic problems, (3) real- world problems, (4) learner-centered learning, (5) active learning, (6) cooperative learning, and (7) customized instruction to meet the  individual learner’s   needs.   These strategies engage the learner   in   some form   of   mental activity,   have the learner   examine that mental  activity and select the best solution, and challenge the learner to explore other ways to accomplish the task or the problem.  

It should be remembered that critical thinking skills should be taught in the context of subject matter. Learners progress from simple  to complex; therefore, they need some information before they can think about a subject beyond rote learning. For example, knowing  that compliance with the weight and balance limits of any aircraft is critical to flight safety may not help an aviation learner interpret  weight and balance charts unless he or she also knows something about the concept of a center of gravity.  

If the learner does not yet have much subject matter knowledge, they can draw on past experiences to gain entry into complex  concepts. For example, most learners probably played on a seesaw during their childhood. Thus, they have a basic experience of how  weight and balance works around a center of gravity.  

Additionally, HOTS should be emphasized throughout a program of study for best results. For aviation, this means HOTS should be  taught in the initial pilot training program and in every subsequent pilot training program. Instructors need to teach the cognitive skills  used in problem-solving until these techniques become automated and transferable to new situations or problems. Cognitive research  has shown the learning of HOTS is not a change in observable behavior but the construction of meaning from experience.  

# Scenario-Based Training (SBT)  

At the heart of HOTS lies scenario-based training (SBT) which is an example of the PBL instructional method and facilitates the  enhancement of learning and the development and transference of thinking skills. SBT provides more realistic decision-making  opportunities because it presents tasks in an operational environment; it correlates new information with previous knowledge, and  introduces new information in a realistic context.  

SBT    a training   system   that uses a structured   script of   “real-world” scenarios   to   address   flight-training objectives in an operational  environment. Such training can include initial training, transition training, upgrade training, recurrent training, and special training.  

The instructor should adapt the scenarios to the aircraft, its specific flight characteristics and the likely flight environment, and should  always require the learner to make real-time decisions in a realistic setting. The scenarios should always be planned and led by the  learner (with the exception of the first flight or two or until the learner has developed the necessary skills).  

SBT not only meets the challenge of teaching aeronautical knowledge to the application level of learning, but also enables the  instructor to teach the underlying HOTS needed to improve ADM. The best use of scenarios draws the learner into formulating  possible solutions, evaluating the possible solutions, deciding on a solution, judging the appropriateness of that decision and finally,  reflecting on the mental process used in solving the problem. It causes the learner to consider whether the decision led to the best  possible outcome and challenges the learner to consider other solutions.  

SBT scenarios help learners better understand the decisions they have to make and also helps focus the learner on the decisions and  consequences involved. It is being used to train people in everything from emergency response to hotel management. The strength of  SBT lies in helping the learner gain a deeper understanding of the information and in the learner improving his or her ability to recall  the information. This goal is reached when the material is presented as an authentic problem in a situated environment that allows the  learner    “make meaning” of   the information   based   on   his   or   her   past experience   and   personal interpretation.  

SBT   has become one of   the primary   methods   to   teach   today’s   aviation   learners   how   to   make good   aeronautical decisions   which   in   turn enhances the safety of all aviation related activities. For information on how to create an SBT lesson, refer to Chapter 5, The  Teaching Process, and for how to incorporate SBT into a training syllabus, refer to Chapter 7, Planning Instructional Activity.  

# Perceptions  

Initially, all learning comes from perceptions, which are directed to the brain by one or more of the five senses: sight, hearing, touch,  smell, and taste. Psychologists have also found that learning occurs most rapidly when information is received through more than one  sense.  [Figure 3-5]  

![](images/e07efadcf69da06fa5466c1d8732cdde8a68758b5a9ebe50c0ff8afca03cfcc5.jpg)  
Figure 3-5.  Most learning occurs through sight, but the combination of sight and hearing accounts for about 88 percent of all  perception.  

Perception involves more than the reception of stimuli from the five senses; it also involves a person giving meaning to sensations.  People base their actions on the way they believe things to be. The experienced AMT, for example, perceives an engine malfunction  quite differently than does an inexperienced learner. This occurs because the beginning aviation learner is overwhelmed by stimuli  and   often   focuses on   meaningless   things,   thus   missing   key   information.   It is   important for   the instructor    direct trainee’s   perceptions  initially so that the learner detects and perceives relevant information.  

Real meaning comes only from within a person, even though the perceptions, which evoke these meanings, result from external  stimuli. The meanings,   which   are derived   from   perceptions,   are influenced   not only   by   the individual’s   experience,   but also   by many  other factors. Knowledge of the factors that affect the perceptual process is very important to the aviation instructor because  perceptions are the basis of all learning.  

# Factors that Affect Perception  

Both   internal and   external factors   affect an   individual’s   ability    perceive:  

⦁  Physical organism  ⦁  Goals and values  ⦁  Self-concept  ⦁  Time and opportunity  ⦁  Element of threat  

# Physical Organization  

The physical organism provides individuals with the perceptual apparatus for sensing the world around them. Pilots, for example,  need to see, hear, feel, and respond adequately while they are in the air.  

# Goals and Values  

Perceptions   depend   on   one’s   values and   goals. Every   experience   and   sensation,   which    funneled   into   one’s   central nervous   system,  is   colored   by   the individual’s   own   beliefs   and   value structures. Spectators   at a ball game may   see   an   infraction   or   foul differently  depending on which team they support. The values of the learner are important for the instructor to know, because this knowledge  assists in predicting how he or she interprets experiences and instructions.  

Goals are also   a product of   one’s   value structure.   Things   that are more highly   valued   and   cherished   are pursued; those accorded less  value and importance are not sought after.  

# Self-Concept  

Self-concept is   a powerful determinant in   learning.    learner’s   self-image,   described    such   terms   as “confident” or   “insecure,” has a  great influence   on   the total perceptual process.    a learner’s   experiences   tend   to   support a favorable self-image, the learner tends to  remain receptive to subsequent experiences. If a learner has negative experiences, which tend to contradict self-concept, there is a  tendency to reject additional training.  

A negative self-concept inhibits the perceptual processes by introducing psychological barriers, which tend to keep the learner from  perceiving. They may also inhibit the ability to properly implement what is perceived. That is, self-concept affects the ability to  actually perform or do things. Learners who view themselves positively, on the other hand, are less defensive and more receptive to  new experiences, instructions, and demonstrations.  

# Time and Opportunity  

It takes time and opportunity to perceive. Learning some things depends on other past perceptions and on the availability of time to  sense and relate these new things to the earlier perceptions. Thus, proper sequence and time are necessary.  

A learner could probably stall an aircraft on the first attempt, regardless of previous experience. Stall recovery cannot really be  learned, however, unless some experience in normal flight has been acquired. Even with such experience, time and practice are  needed to relate the new sensations and experiences associated with stall recovery in order to develop a perception of the stall. In  general, lengthening an experience and increasing its frequency are the most obvious ways to speed up learning, although this is not  always effective. Many factors, in addition to the length and frequency of training periods, affect the rate of learning. The  effectiveness of the use of a properly planned training syllabus is proportional to the consideration it gives to the time and opportunity  factor in perception.  

# Element of Threat  

The element of threat does not promote effective learning. In fact, fear adversely affects perception by narrowing the perceptual field.  Confronted with threat, learners tend to limit their attention to the threatening object or condition. The field of vision is reduced, for  example, when an individual is frightened and all the perceptual faculties are focused on the thing that has generated fear.  

Flight instruction provides many clear examples of this. During the initial practice of steep turns, Beverly may focus her attention on  the altimeter and completely disregard outside visual references. Anything Bill does that is interpreted as threatening makes Beverly  less able to accept the experience Bill is trying to provide. It adversely affects all her physical, emotional, and mental faculties.  

Learning is a psychological process, not necessarily a logical one. Trying to frighten a learner through threats of unsatisfactory reports  or reprisals may seem logical, but is not effective psychologically. The effective instructor organizes teaching to fit the psychological  needs of the learner. If a situation seems overwhelming, the learner feels unable to handle all of the factors involved; a threat exists.  As long as the learner feels capable of coping with a situation, each new experience is viewed as a challenge.  

A good instructor recognizes that behavior is directly influenced by the way a learner perceives, and perception is affected by all of  these factors. Therefore, it is important for the instructor to facilitate the learning process by avoiding any actions which may inhibit  or prevent the attainment of teaching goals. Teaching is consistently effective only when those factors that influence perception are  recognized and taken into account.  

# Insight  

Insight involves the grouping   of   perceptions   into   meaningful wholes. Creating   insight is   one of   the instructor’s   major   responsibilities.  To ensure that this occurs, it is essential to keep each learner constantly receptive to new experiences and to help them understand  how each piece relates to all other pieces of the total pattern of the task.  

For example, during straight-and-level flight in an aircraft with a fixed-pitch propeller, the revolutions per minute (rpm) increase  when the throttle is opened and decrease when it is closed. On the other hand, rpm changes can also result from changes in aircraft  pitch attitude without changes in power setting. Obviously, engine speed, power setting, airspeed, and aircraft attitude are all related.  

True learning requires an understanding of how each factor may affect all of the others and, at the same time, knowledge of how a  change in any one of them may affect all of the others. This mental relating and grouping of associated perceptions is called insight.  

Insight almost always occurs eventually, whether or not instruction is provided. For this reason, it is possible for a person to become  an electrician by trial and error, just as one may become a lawyer by reading law. Instruction, however, speeds this learning process  by   teaching   the relationship   of   perceptions   as they   occur,   thus   promoting   the development of   the learner’s   insight.  

As perceptions increase in number, the learner develops insight by assembling them into larger blocks. As a result, learning becomes  more meaningful and more permanent. Forgetting is less of a problem when there are more anchor points for tying insights together.  It is a major responsibility of the instructor to organize demonstrations and explanations, and to direct practice so that the learner has  better opportunities to understand the interrelationship of the many kinds of experiences that have been perceived. Pointing out the  relationships as they occur, providing a secure and nonthreatening environment in which to learn, and helping the learner acquire and  maintain a favorable self-concept are key steps in fostering the development of insight.  

# Acquiring Knowledge  

Part of   an   aviation   instructor’s   job   is   helping   learners   acquire knowledge.   In   this   context, knowledge refers   to   information   that  humans are consciously aware of and can articulate. For example, knowledge of the fuel capacity of a particular aircraft,  understanding how an internal combustion engine works, and the ability to determine the weight and balance of an aircraft are  examples of knowledge.  

Figure 3-6  shows the three phases of knowledge, a progression of how learners acquire knowledge. Some practical considerations  about learning new knowledge and instructor actions that help learners acquire knowledge are summarized.  

# Memorization  

A   learner’s   first attempt to   acquire knowledge about a new   topic amounts   to   memorizing   facts   about steps   in   a procedure.   For example, when Beverly is learning to use an altimeter, she may have memorized that the knob on the instrument is used to dial the  current barometric pressure and that this number should be obtained from the recorded broadcast and set prior to flight.  

Memorizing facts and steps has an advantage: it allows learners to get started quickly. For example, as soon as Beverly memorizes the  purpose of the knob on the altimeter and the procedure for obtaining the current barometric pressure, she is able to properly configure  the instrument for flight.  

The limitations of memorization become apparent when a learner is asked to solve a problem or provide an explanation of something  that is not covered by the newly acquired knowledge. For example, when asked whether she would rather have the altimeter  mistakenly set too high or too low when flying in mountainous terrain, Beverly may not have an answer.  

# Understanding  

A more experienced pilot can answer the altimeter question because she or he understands the ramifications of the question.  Understanding, or the ability to notice similarities and make associations between the facts and procedural steps learned, is an  important next stage in the knowledge acquisition process. At this stage, the learner begins to organize knowledge in useful ways and  a collection of memorized facts gives way to understanding.  

Understanding develops when learners begin to organize known facts and steps into coherent groups that come together to form an  understanding of how a thing or a process works. For example, after learning to adjust the mixture control in cruise flight, Beverly  learns that combustion requires a certain mixture of fuel and air, and that air becomes less dense as altitude increases.  

![](images/b07418dea3889be9388d9839f1c8d41c55fbf6d323b7c70eab548f826900ad12.jpg)  
Figure 3-6.  A learner acquires knowledge through memorization, understanding, and application.  

Combining these two ideas, she now understands the purpose of the mixture control is to keep these two quantities in balance as the  aircraft changes altitude.   “Mental model” or   self-explanation is often used to refer to an organized collection of ideas that forms a  learner’s   understanding   of   a thing   or   process.  

The advantages of possessing this type of understanding include the following:  

1. The learner is no longer limited to answering questions that match the memorized facts. For example,  armed with the understanding of the mixture control, Beverly may now be able to produce answers to more  challenging questions, such as what would happen if the mixture were set too rich or too lean.  2. Learners who understand a process have an easier time mastering variations of the processes, such as  unfamiliar aircraft, new avionics systems, and unfamiliar airport procedures.  3. Understanding shared between people allows them to communicate more efficiently. For example, an  experienced pilot might mention to an experienced mechanic that a magneto ran a bit rough during an  engine run-up. This brief communication triggers access to a wealth of knowledge in the mind of the  mechanic who instantly knows what to do.  

4. Learners who understand the purpose behind procedure steps are better able to remember the procedure  steps later, or reconstruct them when they are forgotten.  

Mental models evolve as learners take in new information. For example, Bill could ask Beverly why flying with an inappropriate  mixture setting is bad. A learner whose understanding includes knowledge about spark plugs and carbon deposits might answer  correctly.    this   same   learner’s   understanding   later   extends   to   include   knowledge   about   thermal   efficiency   and   the   stoichiometric  equation   for   the   combustion   of   gasoline,   the   explanations   are   likely   to   become   much   more   sophisticated.   No   individual’s   understanding   of   anything    ever   “complete.”  

# Concept Learning  

Concept learning is based on the assumption that humans tend to group objects, events, ideas, people, etc., that share one or more  major attributes that set them apart. It also involves discrimination between types of things or ideas inside or outside of a concept set.  By grouping information into concepts, humans reduce the complexities of life and create manageable categories. Although many  theories about concept learning exist, categorization has always been a central aspect.  

Concept learning enhances understanding when individuals formulate generalized concepts from particular facts or steps. Generalized  concepts are more powerful than facts because instead of literally describing one thing, they describe many things at once.  

For example, a new flight learner who sees several examples of weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft may formulate a category for  WSC aircraft based on the wing, which is large and fabric covered. The power of the category becomes obvious when the learner sees  a sport plane. Because of the similar wing, he or she immediately categorizes it as an ultra l ight and ascribes many of the properties of  ultralight aircraft to the sport plane. In this way, the learner has used a generalized concept to begin understanding something new.  

Most learners exhibit a natural tendency to categorize and become adept at recognizing members of most any category they create. If  something is encountered that does not fit into a category, these learners formulate a new category or revise the definitions of existing  categories. In the above example, the learner eventually needs to revise the category of ultralight to light-sport aircraft which  encompasses both types of aircraft. Therefore, an important part of the learning process is continual revision of the categories used  when learners encounter new things or exceptions to things previously catalogued.  

Another type of generalization is a schema (the cognitive framework that helps people organize and interpret information). Schemas  can be revised by any new information and are useful because they allow people to take shortcuts in interpreting a vast amount of  information.  

Humans form schemas when they notice reoccurring patterns in things frequently observed or done. Schemas help learners interpret  things they observe by priming them to expect certain elements that match the schema. For example, schemas demonstrate why an  experienced pilot is able to listen to and read back a lengthy departure clearance issued by air traffic control (ATC). Beginning flight  learners   often   remember   the   controller’s   use   of   the   words   “the”   and   “and”   and   fail   to   note   more   important   words   that   describe   assigned altitudes or radio frequencies. The experienced pilot is successful because he or she possesses a schema for this type of  event and knows in advance that the clearance contains five key pieces of information. While listening to the clearance, the pilot  anticipates and is primed to capture those five things.  

Similarly, learners create schemas for preflight inspection procedures and procedures required to operate advanced flight deck  systems such as autopilots or multifunction displays. As with categories, humans continuously learn new schemas and revise old ones  to accommodate new things as they continue to learn. While schemas help humans deal with information, they can also make it  difficult to retain new information that does not conform to established schemas.  

# Thorndike and the Laws of Learning  

One of the pioneers of educational psychology, E.L. Thorndike formulated three laws of learning in the early 20th century.  [Figure  3-7]  These laws are universally accepted and apply to all kinds of learning: the law of readiness, the law of exercise, and the law of  effect. Since Thorndike set down his laws, three more have been added: the law of primacy, the law of intensity, and the law of  recency.  

# Readiness  

The basic needs of the learner need to be satisfied before he or she is ready or capable of learning (see Chapter 2, Human Behavior).  The instructor can do little to motivate the learner if these needs have not been met. This means the individual should want to learn  the task being presented and possesses the requisite knowledge and skill. In SBT, the instructor attempts to make the task as  meaningful as   possible and    keep   it within   the learner’s   capabilities.  

![](images/43542965e0078c64581c39cec3e2b875c4737a957105975ac4665e647f5d2e03.jpg)  
Figure 3-7.  E. L. Thorndike (1874–1949).  

Learners best acquire new knowledge when they see a clear reason for doing so, often show a strong interest in learning what they  believe they need to know next, and tend to set aside things for which they see no immediate need. For example, beginning flight  learners   commonly   ignore the flight instructor’s   suggestion   to   use the trim   control. These learners   believe the control yoke is an  adequate way   to   manipulate the aircraft’s   control surfaces. Later   in   training,   when   they   need   to   divert their   attention   away   from the  controls to other tasks, they realize the importance of trim.  

Instructors can take two steps to keep their learners in a state of readiness to learn. First, instructors should communicate a clear set of  objectives to the learner and relate each new topic to those objectives. Second, instructors should introduce topics in a logical order  and leave learners with a need to learn the next topic. The development and use of a well-designed curriculum accomplish this goal.  

Readiness   to   learn   also   involves what is   called   the “teachable moment” or   a moment of   educational opportunity   when   a person   is  particularly responsive to being taught something.  One of the most important skills to develop as an instructor is the ability to  recognize and   capitalize on   “teachable moments” in   aviation   training.   An   instructor   can   find   or   create teachable moments   in   flight  training activity whether it is pattern work, air work in the local practice area, cross-country, flight review, or instrument proficiency  check.  

Teachable moments present opportunities to convey information in a way that is relevant, effective, and memorable to the learner.  They occur when a learner can clearly see how specific information or skills can be used in the real-world.  

For example, while on final approach several deer cross the runway. Bill capitalizes on this teachable moment to stress the  importance of always being ready to perform a go-around.  

# Effect  

Learning involves the formation of connections, and connections are strengthened or weakened according to the law of effect. The  law states that behaviors that lead to satisfying outcomes are likely to be repeated whereas behaviors that lead to undesired outcomes  are less likely to recur. For example, if Bill teaches landings to Beverly during the first flight, she is likely to feel inferior and be  frustrated, which weakens the intended learning connection.  

The learner needs to have success in order to have more success in the future. It is important for the instructor to create situations  designed to promote success. Positive training experiences are more apt to lead to success and motivate the learner, while negative  training experiences might stimulate forgetfulness or avoidance. When presented correctly, SBT provides immediate positive  experiences in terms of real-world applications.  

To   keep   learning   pleasant and   to   maintain   motivation,   an   instructor   should   make positive comments   about the learner’s   progress  before discussing areas that need improving. Flight instructors have an opportunity to do this during the flight debriefing. For  example, Bill praises Beverly on her aircraft control during all phases of flight but offers constructive comments on how to better  maintain the runway centerline during landings.  

# Exercise  

Connections   are strengthened   with   practice and   weakened   when   practice is   discontinued,   which   reflects the adage “use it or   lose it.” The learner needs to practice what has been taught in order to understand and remember the learning. Practice strengthens the  learning connection; disuse weakens it. Exercise is most meaningful and effective when a skill is learned within the context of a real- world application.  

# Primacy  

When an error occurs pouring a concrete foundation for a building, undoing and correcting the job becomes much more difficult than  doing it right the first time. Primacy in teaching and learning, what is learned first, often creates a strong, almost unshakable  impression and underlies the reason an instructor needs to teach correctly the first time.  

Also, if the task is learned in isolation, it is not initially applied to the overall performance, or if it needs to be relearned, the process  can be confusing and time consuming. The first experience should be positive, functional, and lay the correct foundation for all that is  to follow.  

# Intensity  

Immediate, exciting, or dramatic learning connected to a real situation teaches a learner more than a routine or boring experience.  Real-world applications (scenarios) that integrate procedures and tasks the learner is capable of understanding make a vivid  impression, and he or she is least likely to forget the experience. For example, using realistic scenarios has been shown to be effective  in the development of proficiency in flight maneuvers, tasks, and single-pilot resource management (SRM) skills.  

# Recency  

The principle of recency states that things most recently learned are best remembered. Conversely, the further a learner is removed in  time from a new fact or understanding, the more difficult it is to remember. For example, it is easy for a learner to recall a torque  value used a few minutes earlier, but it is more difficult or even impossible to remember a value last studied or used further back in  time.  

Instructors recognize the principle of recency when they carefully plan a summary for a ground school lesson, a shop period, or a  postflight critique. The instructor repeats, restates, or reemphasizes important points at the end of a lesson to help the learner  remember them. The principle of recency often determines the sequence of lectures within a course of instruction.  

In SBT, the closer the training or learning time is to the time of the actual scenario, the more apt the learner is to perform  successfully. This law is most effectively addressed by making the training experience as much like the scenario as possible.  

# Domains of Learning  

As mentioned during the discussion of Cognitive Theory, Dr. Bloom played a central role in transforming the field of educational  psychology. Interested in what and how people learn, he proposed a framework to help understand the major areas of learning and  thinking. He first classified them into three large groups  [Figure 3-8]  called the domains of learning:  

⦁  Cognitive (thinking)  ⦁  Affective (feeling)  ⦁  Psychomotor (doing)  

![](images/13f0eff1ee04523fa473c28191941575557ed5f2dd0b7ede668e10ba5377a486.jpg)  
Figure 3-8.  An overview of the three learning domains.  

# Cognitive Domain  

The cognitive domain is one of the best known educational domains. It includes remembering specific facts (content knowledge) and  concepts that help develop intellectual abilities and skills. There are six major categories, or levels, starting from the simplest  behavior (recalling facts) to the most complex (evaluation).  [Figure 3-9]  

![](images/69f10d88fcb42a4b3b6d5ca1afac504944d57b2347c5dc45bd926d9eecdd7a43.jpg)  

The four practical learning levels are rote, understanding, application, and correlation.  [Figure 3-10]  The lowest level is the ability to  repeat something which one has been taught, without understanding or being able to apply what has been learned. This is referred to  as rote learning. The fact level is a single concept. The key verbs which describe or measure this activity are words such as define,  identify, and label. The comprehension or understanding level puts two or more concepts together and uses verbs such as describe,  estimate, or explain. The application level puts two or more concepts together to form something new. Typical verbs at this level  include “determine,” “develop,” and   “solve.”  

![](images/a45460972ca997365bf3c8610c1666b47f3842316c478fe8eec95eff761bc5b3.jpg)  
Figure 3-10.  Learning is progressive and occurs at several basic levels.  

For example, Bill may explain the procedure for entering a level, left turn to Beverly. The procedure includes several steps: (1)  visually clear the area, (2) add a slight amount of power to maintain airspeed, (3) apply aileron control pressure to the left, (4) add  sufficient rudder pressure in the direction of the turn to avoid slipping and skidding, and (5) increase back pressure to maintain  altitude. When Beverly verbally repeats this instruction, she has learned the procedure by rote. This will not be very useful to her if  there is never an opportunity to make a turn in flight, or if she has no knowledge of the function of aircraft controls.  

With proper instruction on the effect and use of the flight controls, and experience in controlling the aircraft during straight-and-level  flight, Beverly can consolidate old and new perceptions into an insight on how to make a turn. At this point, she has developed an  understanding of the procedure for turning the aircraft in flight. This understanding is basic to effective learning, but may not  necessarily enable her to make a correct turn on the first attempt.  

When Beverly understands the procedure for entering a turn, has had turns demonstrated, and has practiced turn entries until  consistency has been achieved, she has developed the skill to apply what has been learned. This is a major level of learning, and one  at which the instructor is too often willing to stop. Discontinuing instruction on turn entries at this point and directing subsequent  instruction exclusively to other elements of piloting performance is characteristic of piecemeal instruction, which is usually  inefficient.  

The correlation level of learning, which should be the objective of aviation instruction, is that level at which the individual becomes  able to associate an element which has been taught with other segments or blocks of learning. The other segments may be items or  skills previously learned or new tasks to be undertaken in the future. When Beverly has achieved this level of learning in turn entries,  for example, she has developed the ability to correlate the elements of turn entries with the performance in traffic patterns.  

The three higher levels of the cognitive domain include analysis, synthesis and evaluation (the HOTS level previously mentioned in  the learning theory section). The analysis level involves breaking the information into its component parts, examining, and trying to  understand the information in order to develop conclusions, make inferences, and/or find evidence to support generalizations. This  level uses such verbs as points out, differentiate, distinguish, examine, discriminate, compare, outline, prioritize, recognize, or  subdivide.  

Synthesis involves putting parts together to form a new and integrated whole. Typical verbs for this level include create, design, plan,  organize, generate, write, adapt, compare, formulate, devise, model, revise, or incorporate. The final level in the taxonomy is  evaluation and involves making judgments about the merits of ideas, materials, or phenomena. The following example demonstrates  the difference between learning on the first three levels versus learning critical thinking skills.  

Bill provides a detailed explanation on how to control for wind drift. The explanation includes a thorough coverage of heading,  speed, angle of bank, altitude, terrain, and wind direction plus velocity. The explanation is followed by a demonstration and repeated  practice of a specific flight maneuver, such as turns around a point or S-turns across the road until the maneuver can be consistently  accomplished in a safe and effective manner within a specified limit of heading, altitude, and airspeed. At the end of this lesson,  Beverly is only capable of performing the maneuver.  

Then Bill asks Beverly to plan for the arrival at a specific nontowered airport. The planning should take into consideration the  possible wind conditions, arrival paths, airport information and communication procedures, available runways, recommended traffic  patterns, courses of action, and preparation for unexpected situations. Upon arrival at the airport, Beverly makes decisions (with  guidance and feedback as necessary) to safely enter and fly the traffic pattern. This is followed by a discussion of what was done, why  it was done, the consequences, and other possible courses of action and how it applies to other airports. At the end of this lesson the  learner is capable of explaining the safe arrival at any nontowered airport in any wind condition.  

For aviation instructors, educational objectives for the first three levels (knowledge, comprehension, and application) are generally  gained as the result of attending a ground school, reading about aircraft systems, listening to a preflight briefing, or taking part in  computer-based training. The highest educational objective levels in this domain (analysis, synthesis, and evaluation) can be acquired  through SBT training. For example, the learner pilot understands how to correctly evaluate a flight maneuver or the maintenance  learner repairs an aircraft engine. Sample questions for each level of the cognitive domain are provided in Figure 3-9.  

# Affective Domain  

The affective domain   addresses a learner’s   emotions   toward   the educational experience.   It includes feelings,   values, enthusiasms,  motivations, and attitudes.  [Figure 3-11]  For the aviation instructor, this may mean how the individual approaches learning. Is he or  she motivated to learn? Does he or she exhibit confidence in learning? Does the learner display a positive attitude towards safety and  risk mitigation?  

The affective domain provides a framework for teaching in five levels: awareness, response, value, organizing, and integration. In this  taxonomy, the learner begins on the awareness level and is open to learning, willing to listen to the instructor. As the learner traverses  the taxonomy, he or she responds by participating actively in the training, decides the value of the training, organizes the training into  his or her personal belief system, and finally internalizes it.  

![](images/57cf0227639be0e689255bdbe9d63917e3a6d3d731d3f13f32ccbdad1d0350e9.jpg)  
Figure 3-11.  The affective domain (attitudes, beliefs, and values) contains five educational objective levels.  

The affective domain is more difficult to measure, but motivation and enthusiasm are important components of any learning.  Therefore, the aviation instructor should be acquainted with this facet of learning. Motivation is discussed in depth later in the  chapter.  

# Psychomotor Domain  

The psychomotor domain is skill based and includes physical movement, coordination, and use of the motor-skill areas.  [Figure  3-12]  Development of these skills utilizes repetitive practice and is measured in terms of speed, precision, distance, and techniques.  While various examples of the psychomotor domain exist, the practical instructional levels for aviation training purposes include the  following:  

⦁  Observation 

 ⦁  Imitation 

 ⦁  Practice 

 ⦁  Habit  

![](images/836c97a4e80b442a58768ed5e4b1311bbf7b4fb236fe3a5a9a4f0b2c4ac7033f.jpg)  
Figure 3-12.  The psychomotor domain (physical skills) consists of seven educational objective levels.  

These basic levels make up the broad instructional process, indepen d ent of the specific domain chosen and are important  components of instruction when aviation instructors prepare learners for the practical test.  

At the first level, the learner observes a more experienced person perform the skill. The instructor has the learner observe sequences  and relationships that lead to the finished product. Observation may be supplemented by reading, watching a DVD, or computer- based training. The second level is imitation in which the learner attempts to copy the skill under the watchful eye of the instructor.  

The practice level is a proficiency building experience in which the learner tries a specific activity over and over. It may be conducted  by the learner without direct oversight of the instructor, such as touch-and-go landings for the flight learner who has flown a  successful solo flight. The habit level is reached when the learner can perform the skill in twice the time that it takes the instructor or  an expert to perform. The evaluation of ability is a performance or skill test. If a person continues to perfect a skill, it eventually  becomes a skill performed at the expert level.  

Skills involving the psychomotor domain include learning to fly a precision instrument approach procedure, programming a global  positioning system (GPS) receiver, or using sophisticated maintenance equipment. As physical tasks and equipment become more  complex, the requirement for integration of cognitive and physical skills increases.  

# Summary of Instructor Actions  

To help learners acquire knowledge, the instructor should:  

⦁  Ask learners to recite or practice newly acquired knowledge.  ⦁  Ask questions that probe learner understanding and prompt them to think about what they have learned in      different ways.  ⦁  Present opportunities for learners to apply what they know to solving problems or making decisions.  ⦁  Present learners with problems and decisions that test the limits of their knowledge.  ⦁  Demonstrate the benefits of understanding and being able to apply knowledge.  ⦁  Introduce new topics as they support the objectives of the lesson, whenever possible.  

These additional levels of learning are the basis of the knowledge, attitude, and skill learning objectives commonly used in advanced  qualification programs for airline training. They also can be tied to the ACS to show the level of knowledge or skill required for a  particular task. A list of action verbs for the three domains shows appropriate behavioral objectives at each level.  [Figure 3-13]  Instructors who are familiar with curriculum development recognize that the action verbs are examples of performance-based  objectives.  

![](images/367794460814b4633043cbd7e5e91185444fb8409f9419fb75f7856def87e4f4.jpg)  
Figure 3-13.  A listing such as the one shown here is useful for development of almost any training program.  

# Characteristics of Learning  

The ability   to   learn   is   one of   the most outstanding   human   characteristics.   Learning   occurs   continuously   throughout a person’s   lifetime. To understand how people learn, it is necessary to understand what happens to the individual during the process. In spite of  numerous theories and contrasting views, psychologists generally agree there are many characteristics of learning.  

Knowledge of the general characteristics of learning help an aviation instructor use them in a learning situation. If learning is a  change in behavior as a result of experience, then instruction needs to include a careful and systematic creation of those experiences  that promote learning.   This   process   can   be quite complex   because,   among   other   things,   an   individual’s   background   strongly   influences the way that person learns. To be effective, the learning situation also should be purposeful, based on experience,  multifaceted, and involve an active process.  

# Learning Is Purposeful  

Each learner sees a learning situation from a different viewpoint. Each learner is a unique individual whose past experiences affect  readiness to learn and understanding of the requirements involved. For example, an instructor may give two aviation maintenance  learners the assignment of learning certain inspection procedures. One learner may catch on quickly and be able to competently  present the assigned material. The combination of an aviation background and future goals may enable that learner to realize the need  and   value of   learning   the procedures. A   second   learner’s   goal may   only   be to   comply   with   the instructor’s   assignment, and   may   result  in only minimum preparation. The responses differ because each learner acts in accordance with what he or she sees in the situation.  

Most people have fairly definite ideas about what they want to do and achieve. Their goals sometimes are short term, involving a  matter of days or weeks. On the other hand, their goals may be carefully planned for a career or a lifetime. Each learner has specific  intentions and goals. Some may be shared by other learners. Learners learn from any activity that tends to further their goals. Their  individual needs and attitudes may determine what they learn as much as what the instructor is trying to teach. In the process of  learning, the goals are of paramount significance. To be effective, aviation instructors need to find ways to relate new learning to the  learner’s   goals.  

# Learning Is a Result of Experience  

Since learning is an individual process, the instructor cannot do it for the learner. The learner can learn only from personal  experiences; therefore,   learning   and   knowledge cannot exist apart from   a person.    person’s   knowledge is   a result of   experience, and  no two people have had identical experiences. Even when observing the same event, two people react differently; they learn different  things from it, according to the manner in which the situation affects their individual needs. Previous experience conditions a person  to respond to some things and to ignore others.  

All learning is by experience, but learning takes place in different forms and in varying degrees of richness and depth. For instance,  some experiences involve the whole person while others may be based only on hearing and memory. Aviation instructors are faced  with the problem of providing learning experiences that are meaningful, varied, and appropriate. As an example, learners can learn to  say a list of words through repeated drill, or they can learn to recite certain principles of flight by rote. However, they can make them  meaningful only if they understand them well enough to apply them correctly to real situations. If an experience challenges the  learners, requires involvement with feelings, thoughts, memory of past experiences, and physical activity, it is more effective than a  learning experience in which all the learners have to do is commit something to memory.  

It seems clear enough that the learning of a physical skill requires actual experience in performing that skill. Pilots in training learn to  fly aircraft only if their experiences include flying an aircraft; AMTs in training learn to overhaul power plants only by actually  performing that task. Mental habits are also learned through practice. If learners are to use sound judgment and develop decision- making skills, they need experiences that involve knowledge of general principles and require the use of judgment in solving realistic  problems.  

# Learning Is Multifaceted  

If   instructors   see   their   objective as being   only   to   train   their   learners’   memory   and   muscles, they   are underestimating   the potential of  the teaching situation. Individuals learn much more than expected if they fully exercise their minds and feelings. The fact that these  items   were not included    the instructor’s   plan   does not prevent them   from   influencing   the learning   situation.  

Psychologists sometimes classify learning by types, such as verbal, conceptual, perceptual, motor, problem-solving, and emotional.  Other classifications refer to intellectual skills, cognitive strategies, and attitudinal changes, along with descriptive terms like surface  or deep learning. However useful these divisions may be, they are somewhat artificial. For example, a class learning to apply the  scientific method of problem-solving may learn the method by trying to solve real problems. But in doing so, the class also engages in  verbal learning and sensory perception at the same time. Each learner approaches the task with preconceived ideas and feelings, and  for many learners, these ideas change as a result of experience. Therefore, the learning process may include verbal elements,  conceptual elements, perceptual elements, emotional elements, and problem-solving elements all taking place at once. This aspect of  learning will become more evident later in this handbook when lesson planning is discussed.  

Learning is multifaceted in still another way. While learning the subject at hand, individuals may be learning other things as well.  They may be developing attitudes about aviation—good or bad—depending on what they experience. Under a skillful instructor, they  may learn self-reliance. The list is seemingly endless. This type of learning is sometimes referred to as incidental, but it may have a  great impact on the total development of the learner.  

# Learning Is an Active Process  

Learners do not soak up knowledge like a sponge absorbs water. The instructor cannot assume that learners remember something just  because they were in the classroom, shop, or aircraft when the instructor presented the material. Neither can the instructor assume the  learners can apply what they know because they can quote the correct answer verbatim. For effective knowledge transfer, learners  need to react and respond, perhaps outwardly, perhaps only inwardly, emotionally, or intellectually.  

# Learning Styles  

Learning styles are simply different approaches or ways of learning based on the fact that people absorb and process information in  different ways.   Learning   style is   an   individual’s   preference   for   understanding   experiences   and   changing   them   into   knowledge.   It  denotes the typical strategy a learner adopts in a learning situation. For example, information may be learned in a variety of ways: by  seeing or hearing, by reflecting or acting, analyzing or visualizing, or it may be learned piecemeal or steadily. Just as people learn  differently, they also have different teaching methods. Some instructors rely on lectures, others demonstrate, and others may prefer  computer simulation training. Everyone has a mixture of strengths and preferences, not a single style or preference to the complete  exclusion of any other. Please bear this in mind when using these ideas.  

As mentioned in Chapter 2, Human Behavior, and the discussion of personality types and learning, underpinning the idea of learning  style is the theory that everyone has an individual style of learning. According to this approach, if the learner and instructor work with  that style, rather than against it, both benefit. Currently, 71 different theories of learning styles have been identified. These theories  run from simple to complex, usually reflecting scientific research about how the brain processes information. While the scientific  community may be surprised at how the research has been used, many educators and school systems have become advocates of  applying learning style to teaching methods.  

Another   model for   learning,   the Approaches to   Learning   model,   bases   its   theory   on   the learner’s   intentions.   For   example,   is   the  learner interested in short-term memorization of the material or long-term knowledge? Does the learner want a passing grade on a pop  quiz or the ability to use the material to repair an engine? One feature of the Approaches to Learning is that the approach to learning  depends   on   an   individual’s   reasons   for   learning.   This   theory   reflects the Chapter    Human   Behavior,   discussion   of   adult learners who  come to aviation training with definite reasons.  

While controversy exists over the scientific value of learning styles as well as approaches to learning, many educational psychologists  advocate their use in the learning process. Knowledge of learning styles and approaches can help an instructor make adjustments in  how   material is   presented    his   or   her   learning/teaching   style differs   from   the way   an   individual learns.   Since   a learner’s   information  processing technique, personality, social interaction tendencies, and the instructional methods used are all significant factors, training  programs should be sensitive to different learning styles.  

# Right Brain/Left Brain  

According to research on the human brain, people have a preferred side of the brain to use for understanding and storing information.  While both sides of the brain are involved in nearly every human activity, it has been shown that those with right-brain dominance are  characterized as being spatially oriented, creative, intuitive, and emotional. Those with left-brain dominance are more verbal,  analytical, and objective. Generally, the brain functions as a whole. For example, the right hemisphere may recognize a face, while  the left associates a name to go with the face.  

While most people seem to have a dominant side, it is a preference, not an absolute. On the other hand, when learning is new,  difficult, or   stressful, the brain   seems   to   go   on   autopilot to   the preferred   side.   Recognizing   a learner’s   dominant brain   hemisphere  gives the instructor a guide for ways to teach and reinforce material. There are also some people who use both sides of the brain  equally well for understanding and storing information.  [Figure 3-14]  

![](images/4c9df8b81e148bc57c517a284b63ed4847a38199f0efef99597549624ccc6287.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.  The importance of recognizing a dominant brain hemisphere gives the instructor a guide for ways to teach and reinforce  learning.  

# Holistic/Serialistic Theory  

As seen in  Figure 3-14,  right and left brain learners have preferences for how they process information. Based on  information processing theory, left brain learners or serialistic   learners have an analytic approach to learning. Because they gain  understanding in linear steps, with each step logically following the previous one, these learners need well-defined, sequential steps  where the overall picture is developed slowly, thoroughly, and logically. This is a bottom-up strategy.  

Right brain or holistic learners favor the holistic   strategy and prefer a big picture or global perspective. This is a top-down strategy  and learners tend to learn in large jumps, absorbing material almost randomly without seeing connections, until suddenly “it” clicks  and they get it. Global learners solve complex problems rapidly once they have grasped the big picture, but they often have  difficulty explaining how they did it. This type of learner seeks overall comprehension; analogies help this individual.  

# Index of Learning Styles  

In 1988, Richard Felder and Linda Silverman designed a learning style model with parallel learning styles that classified individuals  as having learning preferences in sensing or intuitive, visual or verbal, active or reflective, sequential or global (discussed under  holistic/serialistic learning style). A questionnaire developed by Felder and Solomon that offers learners the opportunity to  assess learning preferences at no cost for noncommercial purposes is available at  www.webtools.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ .  [Figure 3-15]

# Visual, Auditory Kinesthetic Learners  

One of the most popular learning styles is based on the three main sensory receptors: vision, hearing, and touch. These are called  visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles (VAK).  [Figure 3-16]  Research in this area dates back to the early 20th century and  the concepts were developed over many years by psychologists and teaching specialists. Others have augmented the VAK model with  the addition   of    for   “reading” (VARK),   or   the addition   of    for   “tactile”   (VAKT),   or   even   a combination   of   the terms   for   VARKT.

Figure 3-16.  Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning styles (VAK).  

Learners generally use all three styles to receive information, but one of these three ways of receiving information is dominant. Once  again, the dominant style of receiving information is the best way for a person to learn new information, but this style may not be the  same for every task. The learner may use one style of learning or a combination of styles depending on the task.  

Visual learners rely on seeing information. They learn best if a major component of the lesson is something they can see, and work  best with printed and graphic materials, visual displays including diagrams, illustrated text books, overhead presentations, videos, flip  charts, and hand-outs. They store information in their brains as pictures or images. They like to take extensive notes. Statistically,  most people are visual learners.  

Auditory learners transfer knowledge through listening and speaking. These learners need an oral component to the lesson such as  verbal instructions. These learners have excellent listening skills and remember what was discussed over what was seen. They are  better at verbally explaining than at writing. Since auditory learners prefer to listen to material, they are not good note takers.  

Kinesthetic learners process and store information through physical experience such as touching, manipulating, using, or doing. They  like to move around while trying to solve a problem and learn best when the material being taught involves hands-on practical  experiences. Their concentration tends to wander when there is no external stimulation. They also learn from demonstration by  watching   carefully,   then   imagining   or   mirroring   the demonstrator’s   movements.  

Learners may prefer one of these three learning styles over another, but most employ all three depending on the material being taught.  For example, when Beverly makes her first landing with Bill guiding her attempt, she employs visual, auditory, and kinesthetic  learning. As the aircraft enters downwind, Beverly uses visual cues to recognize the airport and landing strip as she lines the aircraft  up to land. As Bill talks her through the procedures, Beverly is using her auditory learning skills to learn how to land the aircraft.  Finally, she needs to use kinesthetic skills to perform the actual landing.  

Remember, good learners are capable of processing information in a variety of ways. The key to meeting individual needs is to ensure  a variety of learning styles are addressed in every lesson.  

# Superlinks  

In a theory proposed by Ricki Linksman, the learning style ideas discussed in the preceding paragraphs have been melded into a  concept based   on   the VAKT   learning   styles plus   brain   hemisphere preference.   This   “superlink,” as she calls   it, is   the easiest   way for a  learner to process information in order to understand, remember, and retain it. Matching visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile with  right- and left-brain research, Linksman created eight superlinks: visual left-brain, visual right-brain, auditory left-brain, auditory  right-brain, tactile left-brain, tactile right-brain, kinesthetic left-brain, and kinesthetic right-brain. These superlinks accelerate learning  by targeting the best way a person learns.  

# Summary  

As mentioned earlier, there are many models of how people learn. Some models identify styles or approaches that are easily  recognized such as collaborative, sharing learners who enjoy working with others, versus competitive learners who are grade  conscious and feel they shou l d do better than their peers. Participant learners normally have a desire to learn and enjoy attending class,  and avoidant learners do not take part in class activities and have little interest in learning.  

The environment also influences learning style. In real life, most learners find it necessary to adapt to a traditional style-learning  environment   provided   by   a school,   university,   or   other   educational/training   establishment.   Sometimes,   the   learner’s   way   of   learning  may or may not be compatible with his or her environment.  

Instructors who recognize either the learning style or learning approach and problems associated with them are more effective  teachers than those who do not. Also, these instructors are prepared to develop appropriate lesson plans and provide guidance,  counseling, or other advisory services, as required.  

# Acquiring Skill Knowledge  

An aviation instructor also helps a learner acquire skill knowledge, which is knowledge reflected in motor or manual skills and in  cognitive or mental skills, that manifests itself in the doing of something. Thus, skill knowledge differs from declarative knowledge  because the learner is not usually aware of it consciously or able to articulate the skill. Evidence of skill knowledge is gained through  observations of performance. This knowledge of how to do things is based on extensive practice, which leads to the storage of skill  knowledge. An everyday example of skill knowledge is the ability to ride a bicycle.  

Skill knowledge is acquired slowly through related experience. For example, a maintenance individual in training who is learning to  weld   typically   burns   or   cracks   the   metal   being   welded   while   an   expert   welder’s   work    free   of   such   imperfections.   What   does   the  experienced   welder   “know”   that   the   beginner   does   not?   The expert welder   has had   many   hours   of   practice and   a knowing-is-in-the­ doing   ability   the inexperienced   welder   lacks.   It isn’t always   possible to   reduce   to   mere words   that which   one knows   or   knows   how to  do.  

# Stages of Skill Acquisition  

Individuals make their way from beginner to expert via three characteristic stages for skill acquisition (or the learning process) as  follows: cognitive, associative, and automaticity. An instructor needs to recognize each stage in learner performance in order to assess  progress.  

# Cognitive Stage  

Cognitive learning has a basis in factual knowledge. Since the learner has no prior knowledge of flying, the instructor first introduces  him or her to a basic skill. The learner then memorizes the steps required to perform the skill. As the learner carries out these  memorized steps, he or she is often unaware of progress, or may fixate on one aspect of performance. Performing the skill at this  stage typically   requires all the learner’s   attention; distractions   introduced   by   an   instructor   often   cause performance   to   deteriorate or  stop.  

The best way to prepare the learner to perform a task is to provide a clear, step-by-step example. Having a model to follow permits  learners to get a clear picture of each step in the sequence so they understand what is required and how to do it. In flight or  maintenance training, the instructor provides the demonstration, emphasizing the steps and techniques. During classroom instruction,  an outside expert may be used, either in person or in a video presentation. In any case, learners need to have a clear impression of  what they are to do.  

For example, Beverly enters a steep turn after increasing power by a prescribed amount and adjusting the pitch trim. She fixates on  the attitude indicator as she attempts to achieve the desired bank angle. The bank angle exceeds tolerances as she struggles to correct  it, making many abrupt control inputs.  

# Associative Stage  

Even demonstrating how to do something does not result in the learner learning the skill. Practice is necessary in order for the learner  to learn how to coordinate muscles with visual and tactile senses. Learning to perform various aircraft maintenance skills or flight  maneuvers requires practice. Another benefit of practice is that as the learner gains proficiency in a skill, verbal instructions become  more meaningful. A long, detailed explanation is confusing before the learner begins performing, whereas specific comments are  more meaningful and useful after the skill has been partially mastered.  

As the storage of a skill via practice continues, the learner understands how to associate individual steps in performance with likely  outcomes. The learner no longer performs a series of memorized steps, but is able to assess his or her progress along the way and  make adjustments in performance. Performing the skill still requires deliberate attention, but the learner is better able to deal with  distractions.  

For example, Beverly enters the steep turn and again struggles to achieve the desired bank angle. Still working on the bank angle, she  remembers the persistent altitude control problem and glances at the altimeter. Noticing that the aircraft has descended almost 100  feet, she increases back pressure on the control and adjusts the trim slightly. She goes back to a continuing struggle with the bank  angle, keeping it under control with some effort, and completes the turn 80 feet higher than started.  

# Automatic Response Stage  

Automaticity is one of the by-products of practice. As procedures become automatic, less attention is required to carry them out, so it  is possible to do other things simultaneously, or at least do other things more comfortably. By this stage, learner performance of the  skill is rapid and smooth. The learner devotes much less deliberate attention to performance, and may be able to carry on a  conversation or perform other tasks while performing the skill. The learner makes far fewer adjustments during his or her  performance and these adjustments tend to be small. The learner may no longer be able to remember the individual steps in the  procedure, or explain how to perform the skill.  

For example, the learner smoothly increases power, adds back pressure on the yoke, and trims the aircraft as a turn is entered. During  the turn, the instructor questions the learner on an unrelated topic. The learner answers the questions, while making two small  adjustments in pitch and trim, and then rolls out of the turn with the altimeter centered on the target altitude. Noting the dramatically  improved   performance,   the instructor   asks   “What are you   doing   differently?” The learner   seems   unsure and   says,    have developed a  feel for   it.”  

# Knowledge of Results  

In some simple skills, learners can discover their own errors quite easily. In other cases, such as learning complex aircraft  maintenance skills, flight maneuvers, or flight crew duties, mistakes are not always apparent. A learner may know that something is  wrong, but not know how to correct it. In any case, the instructor provides a helpful and often critical function in making certain that  the learners are aware of their progress. It is perhaps as important for learners to know when they are right as when they are wrong.  They should be told as soon after the performance as possible, and should not be allowed to practice mistakes. It is more difficult to  unlearn a mistake, and then learn the skill correctly, than to learn correctly in the first place. One way to make learners aware of their  progress is to repeat a demonstration or example and to show them the standards their performance should ultimately meet.  

# How to Develop Skills  

Theories about how a skill evolves from the awkward and deliberate performance associated with the cognitive stage to the smooth  and steady-handed performance of the automatic response stage have one thing in common: progress appears to depend on repeated  practice. Making progress toward automating a skill seems to be largely a matter of performing the skill over and over again. In skill  learning, the first trials are slow and coordination is lacking. Mistakes are frequent but each trial provides clues for improvement in  subsequent trials. The learner modifies different aspects of the skill such as how to hold the yoke or how to weld.  

How long does it take to become proficient at a skill? Studies of skill learning have demonstrated that progress tends to follow what is  known as a power law of practice. This law simply states that the speed of performance of a task improves as a power of the number  of times that the task is performed. The logarithm of the reaction time for a particular task decreases linearly with the logarithm of the  number of practice trials taken. Qualitatively, the law simply says that practice improves performance.  

The graph in  Figure 3-17  shows how the power law of practice relates the time required to perform a skill to the number of times the  skill has been practiced. While it is impossible to predict how many practice trials a learner will require to develop a skill to  maturity, the general shape of the power law of practice offers some clues. Learning progress proceeds at a fast pace in the beginning  (when there is ample room for improvement) and tends to slow down as performance becomes more skilled. In later stages of  learning, improvement is more gradual. Once the curve levels off, it may stay level for a significant period of time. Further  improvement may even seem unlikely. This is called a learning plateau.  

![](images/f8d2859ad41e646f17b15bfdba1d7a4f93b95c8529f1efcdb599f7be50af8637.jpg)  
Figure 3-17.  Learners will probably experience a learning plateau at some point in their training.  

# Learning Plateaus  

A learning plateau may signify any number of conditions. For example, the learner may have reached capability limits, may be  consolidating levels of skill, interest may have waned, or the learner may need a more efficient method for increasing progress. Keep  in mind that the apparent lack of increasing proficiency does not necessarily mean that learning has ceased. When learning motor  skills, a plateau, is normal and should be expected after an initial period of rapid improvement.  

The instructor should prepare the learner for this situation to avert discouragement by explaining that the plateau is normal and  temporary. Instructors can help learners who fall into a plateau by moving the learner to a different place in the curriculum and giving  the current task a break. Instructors should also be aware that they can bring on a learning plateau by over-practice. Learning plateau  problems can sometimes be alleviated also by the instructor better explaining the lesson, the reason for the lesson, and how it applies  to the learner.  

# Types of Practice  

Once a learner learns the skill, it is important to continue some practice to improve retention, but the power law of practice raises the  question of whether or not there is a point at which continued practice no longer leads to improvement. Since athletic coaches, among  others, are very interested in maximizing performance, much research has been done on the subject. Within the last few years,  research has shown that how practice is structured makes an important impact on how well people retain what they have learned.  

There are three types of practice, each of which yields particular results in acquiring skills: deliberate, blocked, and random.  

# Deliberate Practice  

In order for a learner to gain skill knowledge on how to perform the skill automatically, he or she needs to engage in deliberate  practice. This practice is aimed at a particular goal. During deliberate practice, the learner practices specific areas for improvement  and receives specific feedback after practice. The feedback points out discrepancies between the actual performance and the  performance goal sought. During deliberate practice, a learner focuses on eliminating these discrepancies.  [Figure 3-18]  

![](images/6a74d92818085e430bc431846fc8bff8ba30a8f69a67ea79e57c9c613ee33e84.jpg)  
Figure 3-18.  A learner exhibits deliberate practice by plotting courses for his next training flight.  

Studies of skill learning suggest a learner achieves better results if distractions are avoided during deliberate practice. When feedback  is needed to correct learner performance, it should be brief and explicit. Examples of individual skills for pilots are landings, stalls,  steep turns, and procedure flows. Examples for maintenance technicians are correct installation of piston rings on a reciprocating  engine, setting timing on an aircraft engine, and installing a tach generator.  

Unlike the acquisition of knowledge, skill learning does not benefit from the instructor introducing the learner to new ideas or  prompting the learner to think about old ones in different ways. On the other hand, instructors should not confuse distractions during  skill learning with the legitimate use of distractions to help a learner learn how to manage his or her attention while coordinating  several tasks that have been mastered to some degree.  

# Blocked Practice  

Blocked practice is practicing the same drill until the movement becomes automatic. Doing the same task over and over leads to  better short-term performance, but poorer long-term learning. It tends to fool not only the learner but the instructor into thinking the  skills have been well learned. While blocked practice enhances current performance, it does not improve either concept learning or  retrieval from long-term memory.  [Figure 3-19]  

![](images/47104ca020eb682f097092bd6bae717d760cdc3e09db42a46ca08db35da64744.jpg)  
Figure 3-19.  Pilot practices cross-wind landings repeatedly to improve performance.  

# Random Practice  

Random practice mixes up the skills to be acquired throughout the practice session. This type of practice leads to better retention  because by performing a series of separate skills in a random order, the learner starts to recognize the similarities and differences of  each skill which makes it more meaningful. The learner also is able to store the skill more effectively in the long-term memory.  Learners get to retrieve steps and parameters from long-term memory which helps learners recognize patterns between tasks.  

Blocked practice performance scores well during the actual practice when compared to random practice performance. But on a test  given the next day, random practice does better than blocked practice. For long-term retention of aviation knowledge, the instructor  who uses well-written SBT which encourages random practice and leads to better retention of information.  

How much practice is needed to attain proficiency? In planning for learner skill acquisition, a primary consideration is the length of  time devoted to practice. A beginning learner reaches a point where additional practice is not only unproductive, but may even be  harmful. When this point is reached, errors increase, and motivation declines. As a learner gains experience, longer periods of  practice are profitable.  

Another consideration is the problem of whether to divide the practice period. Perhaps even the related instruction should be broken  down into segments, or it may be advantageous to plan one continuous, integrated sequence. The answer depends on the nature of the  skill. Some skills are composed of closely related steps, each dependent on the preceding one. Learning to pack a parachute is a good  example. Other skills are composed of related subgroups of skills. Learning to overhaul an aircraft engine is a good example.  

One way to structure practice to get the most from learning is to expose the learner to the same knowledge and skill in different  contexts. For example, after practicing the short field landing in the aircraft, return to the classroom and rehearse the procedure using  the toy airplane. Then, watch a video that shows a variety of back-to-back landings and have the learner describe what went right and  what went wrong. Each of these methods gives the learner the chance practice the maneuver while adding new perceptions and  insights to his or her skill base.  

# Evaluation Versus Critique  

In the initial stages of skill acquisition, practical suggestions are more valuable to the learner than a grade. Early evaluation is usually  teacher oriented. It provides a check on teaching effectiveness, can be used to predict learner outcomes, and can help the teacher  locate special problem   areas.   The observations   on   which   the evaluations   are based   also   can   identify   the learner’s   strengths   and  weaknesses, a prerequisite for making constructive criticism. For additional information, refer to Chapter 6, Assessment.  

As a learner practices a skill, it is important he or she perform the skill correctly and that the skill being practiced is one that needs to  be developed to maturity. An instructor ensures a skill is practiced correctly by monitoring the practice and providing feedback about  the skill development. The learner profits by having someone watch the performance and provide constructive criticism to help  eliminate errors. Providing compliments on aspects of the skill that were performed correctly help keep the evaluation positive.  Allowing the learner to critique his or her performance enhances learner-centered training.  

Instructors should note learners can develop deviations from the intended method of performance at any stage of skill acquisition.  

# Overlearning of Knowledge  

Overlearning is the continued study of a skill after initial proficiency has been achieved. Practice proceeds beyond the point at which  the act can be performed with the required degree of excellence. The phenomenon of overlearning sometimes occurs when knowledge  used   frequently   begins   to   take on   the properties   of   a skill. For   example,   a learner’s   everyday   knowledge about weight and   balance  concepts   tends   to   center   on   the routine use of   familiar   charts   found   in   the aircraft. Eventually,   the learner’s   performance   is  characterized less by an understanding of weight and balance concepts, and more by an automatic process in which rows and columns  of familiar charts give desired numbers.  

In some cases, the overlearning of knowledge has the advantage of making application of knowledge more streamlined and efficient.  In other cases, the development of automated routines can lead to problems. For example, a verbal checklist procedure becomes so  automatic that a streamlined recitation of checklist items becomes decoupled from the thoughts and actions the checklist items are  intended to trigger. In this case, the pilot or mechanic may not stop to consider each item.  

The development of automated skills can impede further learning or lead to forgetting general knowledge. In one study, learner pilots  and flight instructors were asked to solve weight and balance problems using charts taken from two different aircraft: (1) a small  single-engine airplane they flew on a daily basis and (2) a different small single-engine airplane in which they had no experience. Test  scores were surprisingly low when the charts for the unfamiliar airplane were used, and this was as true for instructors as it was for  learners. The results suggest pilots had focused on developing streamlined, automatic procedures tuned to the details of the familiar  aircraft charts while their ability to use their understanding of overall weight and balance concepts seemed to have diminished.  

Instructors should remain aware of skills learners develop as a result of overlearning and help make sure that their actions continue to  be accompanied by a use of their underlying knowledge. As a learner progresses, the key difference between knowledge and skill  becomes apparent. Memorized   facts   about a topic that once   supported   the beginner’s   awkward   performance   of   the skill tend   to   develop into deeper understanding. Skill acquisition involves learning many individual steps that eventually meld into a seemingly  continuous automated process, at which point the learner has entered the procedural knowledge realm, and may no longer be  consciously aware of the individual steps.  

# Application of Skill  

The final and   critical question    “Can   the learner   use the information   received?” It is   not uncommon   to   find   that learners   devote  weeks and months in school learning new abilities, and then fail to apply these abilities on the job. To solve this problem, two  conditions need to be present. First, the learner needs to understand the skill so well that it becomes easy, even habitual. Second, the  learner should be able to recognize the types of situations where it is appropriate to use the skill. This second condition involves the  question of transfer of learning, which is discussed later in this chapter.  

# Summary of Instructor Actions  

To help learners acquire skills, the instructor should:  

⦁  Explain that the key to acquiring and improving any skill is continued practice.  ⦁  Monitor learner practice of skills and provide immediate feedback.  ⦁  Avoid conversation and other distractions when learners are practicing individual skills.  ⦁  Explain that learning plateaus are common and that continued practice leads to continued improvement.  

# Putting It All Together  

Many skills are taught before a learner can fly an airplane or a maintenance learner can rebuild an aircraft engine. Just as practicing  scales is   a fundamental part of   learning    play   the piano,   the learner   does not “make music” until the ability    combine the notes in a  variety of ways is acquired. For the learner pilot or technician, practicing specific skills is essential, but flying a cross-country trip or  repairing   a collapsed   landing   gear   requires “putting   it all together” in   the right way    achieve success.  

The following section looks at the challenge of learning to perform several tasks at once, dealing with distractions and interruptions,  overcoming problems with fixation and inattention. It also describes the benefits of using realistic training scenarios to develop these  abilities.  

# The Multitasking Mistake  

The term multitasking is often taken for granted to mean handling several tasks at the same time. For example, when a pilot is on  approach for a landing it is easy to assume that the experienced pilot is performing tasks in concurrence such as ATC  communications, scanning instrumentation, and adjusting for minor deviations through the flight controls. We assume that, due to  experience and practiced refinement, such skills at some point become automatic and somewhat instinctive. This belief can lead to a  false sense of confidence that the routine procedure at hand is  only  routine and therefore does not require the added attention to  question one's assumption that there will be no deviation in that task.  [Figure 3-20]  

![](images/bffbb22f278d919bb3423ae770f4a03e38e0d48af4701911563cea8621e1edec.jpg)  
Figure 3-20.  A pilot is required to perform several tasks at once during approach es   and landings.  

# Priorities of Task Management  

It is generally impossible to look at two different things at the same time. The area of focused vision (called the fovea) is only a few  degrees in span and can only be directed to one location at a time. Similarly, people cannot listen to two conversations at the same  time. While both conversations fall upon the ears at once, people need to devote their attention to the comprehension of one, to the  exclusion of the other.  

In the flight deck, a pilot is encumbered with any number competing events, tasks, and actions that each demand the attention of the  pilot. While the pilot may believe that he or she is successfully managing these many tasks at the same time, in actuality, it is difficult  to process more than one thought in congruence. This is especially true when one or more tasks go beyond perceived automation and  require cognitive effort. To help reduce the risk of information-processing bottlenecks, it may be necessary for the pilot to employ  attention switching.  

Continuously switching attention back and forth between two or more tasks is attention switching. For example, when Beverly uses a  checklist to perform a preflight inspection, she continuously switches her attention between the checklist and the equipment she is  inspecting. She looks at the checklist to retrieve the next step in the procedure, and then looks at the equipment to perform the step.  

There is a danger in task switching. The individual may decide that one task is less of a priority than another and choose to postpone  resolution of that task. In doing so, it is very easy to simply forget the deferred task completely. Or, should the pilot become  momentarily distracted, then effort should be made to remember what task to return to and at what stage of resolution that task was  left in. Even the act of managing such tasks is in and of itself a task.  

# Increased Workload, Diminished Quality  

A common response to an overwhelming workload is to reduce the level of standards for quality and achievement. Preemptively  evaluating an impending task list to then choose to reduce (or even remove) relatively unimportant tasks can be a safe and effective  action against the stresses that often comes with overburdened workload. However, it is not always the case that individuals have the  time (or cognitive discipline as referenced in Chapter 2, Human Behavior) to accurately predict what tasks should instead be focused  on. Sometimes the individual (especially those inexperienced or under high stress) reverts to a reaction-based response process. This  can create a negative environment that may actually induce more stress as the individual continually tries to respond to each task  without an overall plan.  

# Learning to Task Manage  

Before learners are asked to perform several tasks at once, instructors should ensure that the learner has devoted enough time to study  and practice such that the individual tasks can be performed reasonably well in isolation.  

Inexperience with an individual task can often hinder attempts to combine it with other tasks. For example, a learner distracted by  trying to interpret unfamiliar symbols on a sectional chart inadvertently deviates from assigned attitude or heading. An instructor  recognizes the need to spend more time with these skills in isolation. In this case, there is nothing about the experience of controlling  the aircraft that helps learners better understand chart symbols.  

# Distractions and Interruptions  

A   distraction    an   unexpected   event that causes the learner’s   attention   to   be momentarily   diverted.   Learners   need   to   decide whether  or not a distraction warrants further attention or action on their part. Once this has been decided, the learners either turn their attention  back to what they were doing, or act on the distraction.  

An interruption is an unexpected event for which the learner voluntarily suspends performance of one task in order to complete a  different one. Interruptions are a significant source of errors and learners need to be aware of the potential for errors caused by  interruptions and develop procedures for dealing with them. A classic example is an interruption that occurs while a learner is  following the steps in a written procedure or checklist. The learner puts down the checklist, deals with the interruption, and then  returns to the procedure—but erroneously picks up at a later point in the procedure, omitting one or more steps.  

# Fixation and Inattention  

Since human attention is limited in focus and highly prone to distraction, people are vulnerable to two other types of problems:  fixation and inattention.  

Fixation occurs when a learner becomes absorbed in performing one task to the exclusion of other tasks. Instructors see many  examples of this in learner performance. Beginning instrument pilots characteristically fixate on particular instruments, attempting to  control one aspect of their performance while other aspects deteriorate. Fixation on a task is often a sign that the task has not received  enough practice in isolation. That is, the learner has not yet mastered the task well enough to perform it in addition to other tasks.  Fixation can happen even when individual skills have been reasonably mastered, when learners have not yet learned the importance of  managing their own limited attentional resources.  

Inattention occurs when a learner fails to pay attention to a task that is important. Inattention is sometimes a natural by-product of  fixation. Learners fixate on one task and become too busy to attend to other tasks. Inattention also happens when learners are not  busy: attention may drift when they become bored or think that a task does not deserve their attention. In some cases, this type of  inattention is difficult to eliminate through training and practice. For example, it is well known that humans perform poorly when  placed in the role of passive monitor. Many studies have shown how performance rapidly deteriorates when humans are asked to  passively monitor gauges or the progress of an automated system such as a GPS navigation computer or autopilot. Furthermore, it  seems that the more reliable the system becomes, the poorer the human performance becomes at the monitoring task. The first line of  defense against this type of inattention is to alert the learner to the problem, and to help develop habits that keep their attention  focused.  

# How to Identify Fixation or Inattention Problems  

One way for instructors to identify problems with fixation and inattention is to try and follow where learners look. To accomplish this,  instructors   can   glance   at a learner’s   eyes to   try   to   determine where they   are looking.   Learners   who   appear   to   look   at one instrument  for an extended period of time might have a problem with fixation. Learners whose gaze is never directed toward engine instruments  might have a problem with inattention.  

The technique of following learner eye movements is useful, but has limitations since looking in the same direction is not the same as  “seeing” what the learner   sees.  

# Scenario-Based Training (SBT)  

Research and practical experience have demonstrated the usefulness of practicing in realistic scenarios—ones that resemble the  environment in which knowledge and skills are later used. Instructors should devise scenarios that allow learners to practice what they  have learned. This is challenging because different learners need to practice different things at different times, and because different  working environments present different practice opportunities.  

What makes a good scenario? A good scenario:  

⦁  Has a clear set of objectives.  ⦁  Is tailored to the needs of the learner.  ⦁  Capitalizes on the nuances of the local environment.  

For example, Bill is introducing Beverly to a low-fuel emergency. His objective at this early stage is to simply enable Beverly to  recall the sorts of actions that are appropriate for a low-fuel emergency. He decides to use the classroom environment as a first  practice scenario. He asks Beverly about what sorts of actions she might take if such an event would occur. She has some good ideas  but he asks her to think more about before her next lesson. On her next lesson he gives her the same exercise. This time her answers  are consistent and insightful. Bill decides that this scenario has served its purpose and moves on.  

During   their   next flight, Bill’s   objective is   having   Beverly   recall and   carry   out the steps   that she was able to   cite in   the classroom. As  they arrive at their home airport, he presents Beverly with a low-fuel scenario. He notes that she remembers much of what she was  able to recall in the classroom, but amidst the excitement, has forgotten a few things. He uses the same scenario at a different airport  on their next flight, and she performs admirably.  

Later   in   her   training,   Bill’s   next objective is   to   enable her   to   recall and   perform   the emergency   steps   in   concert with   other   piloting  duties. They depart on a cross-country flight from a populated area to a remote area. While en route, Bill presents Beverly with a low- fuel emergency scenario knowing that there is only one airport nearby and that it is not easy to spot. She successfully uses her  available navigational resources to locate and arrive at the airport. Upon returning home, Bill attempts to generalize her new abilities  and put yet a different spin on the same problem. He presents the low-fuel scenario, taking advantage of the fact that there are eight  nearby airports. All of the airports are in plain view, and she can choose one.  

Each of these scenarios taught Beverly something she needed to learn next, and made good use of the surroundings and available  circumstances.   As   these examples illustrate,   there is   no   list of   “canned” scenarios   that can   be used   for   all learners.   Instructors should  devise their own scenarios by considering what each learner needs to practice, and exploiting features of the local environment that  allow them to do it.  

# The Learning Route to Expertise  

What does it take to successfully orchestrate all of the knowledge and skills the learner has learned into what instructors, evaluators,  and other pilots and mechanics would regard as true expertise? All evidence seems to point once again to the idea of practice. Just as  the perfection of an individual skill seems to rely on repeated practice, so does the combination of knowledge and skills that make up  our abilities to do the real-world job of pilot or mechanic.  

How much practice does it take to become a true expert? In a study of expert performers in fields ranging from science to music to  chess, one psychologist found that no performer had reached true expertise without having invested at least ten years of practice in his  or her field. Experts have been found to use two tools to help them gain expertise in their field: cognitive strategies and problem- solving tactics.  

# Cognitive Strategies  

The idea of cognitive strategies emerged over 50 years ago in the context of human information processing theory. Cognitive  strategies refer to the knowledge of procedures or knowledge about how to do something in contrast with the knowledge of facts.  They use the mind to solve a problem or complete a task and provide a structure for learning that actively promotes the  comprehension and retention of knowledge. A cognitive strategy helps the learner develop internal procedures that enable him or her  to perform higher level operations.  

As learners acquire experience, they develop their own strategies for dealing with problems that arise frequently. For example, a  learner develops the following strategy for avoiding inadvertent flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) at night. He  or she checks the weather prior to departure, obtains updates on the weather every hour, and plans to divert to an alternate destination  at the first suspicion of unexpected weather ahead.  

One approach to helping develop cognitive strategies is to study and identify the strategies that experts use and then teach these  strategies to the learners. Expert strategies were identified by researchers who presented experts with problems to solve and asked  them to think aloud as they attempted to solve the problems. These cognitive strategies can be taught to learners, usually with  successful results.  

# Problem-Solving Tactics  

Problem-solving tactics are specific actions intended to get a particular result, and this type of knowledge represents the most targeted  knowledge in   the expert’s   arsenal.   For   example,   a learner   notices how   easy   it is   to   make a mistake with   a takeoff   distance   chart after  using it several times. She notices her finger drifts upward or downward when sliding it across a row of numbers on the chart,  sometimes landing on the wrong number. The learner formulates several tactics to ensure she obtains the correct figures: (1) work  slowly and deliberately, (2) use a ruler, and (3) double-check the work.  

But even   the experts   had    practice.   In   a study   of   violinists   at a music academy    Berlin,   researchers   compared   the “best” learners to  those who   were regarded   as merely   “very   good.” Using   estimates of   how   many   total hours   each   learner   had   spent practicing   during  his or her lifetime, the researchers found that the best violinists had spent an average of 7,000 hours practicing, while the very good  violinists   had   logged   about 5,000   hours.   The scientific study   of   expertise reiterates the adage: “Practice makes perfect.”  

# Awareness of Existence of Unknowns  

An   important aspect of   an   expert’s   knowledge is   an   awareness   of   what he or   she does not know.   This    not always   the case with a  learner.   It’s   important that an   instructor   be aware of   situations   in   which   learners   have acquired   “book” knowledge,   but not yet  acquired the more in-depth understanding that comes from association and experience. For example, after acquiring substantial  knowledge of a single-engine, two-seat training aircraft, learners should understand that a four-seat aircraft by the same manufacturer  should be approached with caution and not overconfidence.  

# Summary of Instructor Actions  

To help learners exercise their knowledge and skills in a concerted fashion, the instructor should:  

⦁  Explain the difference between normal task switching and interruption multitasking and give examples of each.  ⦁  Ensure that individual skills are reasonably well-practiced before asking learners to perform several tasks at once.  ⦁  Teach learners how to deal with distractions and interruptions and provide them with opportunities to practice.  ⦁  Point out fixation and inattention when it occurs.  ⦁  Devise scenarios that allow learners to use their knowledge and skill to solve realistic problems and make decisions.  ⦁  Explain to the learner that continued practice with the goal of improving leads to continued improvement.  

# Errors  

Errors are a natural part of human performance. Beginners, as well as the most highly skilled experts, are vulnerable to error, and this  is perhaps the most important thing to understand about error. To believe people can eliminate errors from their performance is to  commit the biggest error of all. Instructors and learners alike should be prepared for occasional errors by learning about common  kinds of errors, how errors can be minimized, how to learn from errors, and how to recover from errors when they are made.  

# Kinds of Errors  

There are two kinds of errors: slips and mistakes.  

Slip  

A slip occurs when a person plans to do one thing, but then inadvertently does something else. Slips are errors of action. Slips can  take on a variety of different forms. One of the most common forms of slips is to simply neglect to do something. Other forms of slips  occur when people confuse two things that are similar. Accidentally using a manual that is similar to the one really needed is an  example of this type of slip.  

Other forms of slips happen when someone is asked to perform a routine procedure in a slightly different way. For example, Beverly  has been assigned runway 30 for many days in a row. This morning she approaches to land and ATC assigns runway 12 instead. As  she approaches the traffic pattern, she turns to enter the pattern for runway 30 out of habit.  

Time pressure is another common source of slips. Studies of people performing a variety of tasks demonstrated a phenomenon called  the speed-accuracy   tradeoff.   The more hurried   one’s   work   becomes the more slips   one is   likely    make.  

# Mistake  

A mistake occurs when a person plans to do the wrong thing and is successful. Mistakes are errors of thought. Mistakes are  sometimes the result of   gaps   or   misconceptions   in   the learner’s   understanding.   One type of   mistake happens   when   a learner   formulates an understanding of a phenomenon and then later encounters a situation that shows how this understanding was incorrect  or incomplete. For example, overly simplistic understanding of weather frequently leads inexperienced learners into situations that are  unexpected.  

Experts are not immune to making mistakes, which sometimes arise from the way an expert draws upon knowledge of familiar  problems and responds to them using familiar solutions.  [Figure 3-21]  Mistakes can occur when the expert categorizes a particular  case incorrectly. For example, an experienced pilot may become accustomed to ignoring nuisance alerts issued by his traffic alerting  system when approaching his home airport, as many aircraft on the ground turn on their transponders prior to takeoff. One night, he  ignores an alert that was generated not by an aircraft on the ground, but rather by another aircraft that has turned in front of him on  final approach.  

# Reducing Error  

Although it is impossible to eliminate errors entirely, there are ways to reduce them, as described in the following paragraphs.  

# Learning and Practicing  

The first line of defense against errors is learning and practice. Higher levels of knowledge and skill are associated with a lower  frequency and magnitude of error.  

# Taking Time  

Errors can often be reduced by working deliberately at a comfortable pace. Hurrying does not achieve the same results as faster  performance   that is   gained   by   increasing   one’s   skill through   continued   practice.  

# Checking for Errors  

Another way to help avoid errors is to look actively for evidence of them. Many tasks in aviation offer a means of checking work.  Learners should be encouraged to look for new ways of checking their work.  

![](images/ee03ccd42eeb2501282b8c315acaf9410ba4e9fff94a40e26c9f3003b78464cb.jpg)  
Figure 3-21.  Other mistakes arise under pressure. For example, a technician or pilot might perform a cursory inspection of an  aircraft to save time, only to have a problem manifest itself later.  

# Using Reminders  

Errors are reduced when visible reminders are present and actively used. Checklists and other published procedures are examples of  reminders. Many aircraft instruments such as heading indicators offer bugs that can be used to remind the pilot about assigned  headings and courses and some may also prompt altitudes and airspeeds. Mechanics and pilots alike can use notepads to jot down  reminders or information that should otherwise be committed to memory.  

# Developing Routines  

The use of standardized procedures for routine tasks is widely known to help reduce error. Even when a checklist procedure is  unavailable or impractical, learners can help reduce the occurrence of error by adopting standardized procedures.  

# Raising Awareness  

Another   line of   defense against errors    to   raise one’s   awareness   when   operating   in   conditions   under   which   errors   are known   to  happen (e.g., changes in routine, time pressure), or in conditions under which defenses against errors have been compromised (e.g.,  fatigue, lack of recent practice).  

# Error Recovery  

Given that the occasional error is inevitable, it is a worthwhile exercise to practice recovering from commonly made errors, or those  that pose serious consequences. All flight learners need to learn and practice a lost procedure to ensure that they can recover from the  situation in which they have lost their way. It is useful to devote the same sort of preparation to other common learner errors.  

# Learning from Error  

Error can be a valuable learning resource. Learners naturally make errors, which instructors can utilize in training to help while being  careful not to let the individual practice doing the wrong thing. When a learner makes an error, it is useful to ask them to consider  why the error happened, and what could be done differently to prevent the error from happening again in the future. In some cases,  errors are slips that simply reveal the need for more practice. In other cases, errors point to aspects of learner methods or habits that  might be improved. For example, beginning instrument flight learners commonly make errors when managing two communications  radios,   each   with   an   active and   standby   frequency.   When   the same learners   understand   each   radio’s   specific purpose (e.g.,   ATIS,  ground, tower frequencies), error rates often drop quickly.  

Instructors and learners should be aware of a natural human tendency to resist learning from errors. That is, there is a tendency to  “explain   away” errors,   dismissing   them   as one-time events that will likely never happen again. The same phenomenon occurs when  observing errors made by others. Reading an accident or incident report, it is easy to spot where a pilot or mechanic made an error  and regard the error as something that could never happen to the reader. It is important to note that this type of bias is not necessarily  the result of ego or overconfidence; rather, it is something to which we are all susceptible. Psychologist Baruch Fischoff studied  hindsight explanations given by people who were presented with descriptions of situations and their ultimate outcomes. When asked  to provide explanations for events that had already occurred and for which the outcome was known, people explained that the  outcomes were “obvious” and   “predictable.” When   the same events   without the outcomes were presented    a second   group,   peoples’   prediction   of   the outcome was no   better   than   chance   guessing.   The study   nicely   illustrates the popular   adage that “hindsight is   20/20.”  

# Summary of Instructor Actions  

To help learners learn from errors they make and be prepared for them in the future, an instructor should:  

⦁  Explain that pilots and mechanics at all levels of skill and experience make occasional errors.  ⦁  Explain that the magnitude and frequency of errors tend to decrease as skill and experience increases.  ⦁  Explain the difference between slips and mistakes and provide examples of each.  ⦁  Explain ways in which the learner can help minimize errors.  ⦁  Allow the learner to practice recovering from common errors.  ⦁  Point out errors when they occur and ask the learner to explain why they occurred.  

# Memory  

Memory is the vital link between the learner learning/retaining information and the cognitive process of applying what is learned. It is  the ability of people and other organisms to encode (initial perception and registration of information), store (retention of encoded  information over time), and retrieve (processes involved in using stored information) information.  [Figure 3-22]  When a person  successfully recalls a past experience (or skill), information about the experience has been encoded, stored, and retrieved.  

![](images/5b34817fff2076ec40e06bffc0334a032e9d695b96f3a8a8d32c74512d31e180.jpg)  
Figure 3-22.  Information processing within the sensory register, working on short-term memory, and long-term memory includes  complex coding, sorting, storing, and recall functions.  

Although there is no universal agreement of how memory works, a widely accepted model has three components: sensory memory,  short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM).  

# Sensory Memory  

Sensory memory is the part of the memory system that receives initial stimuli from the environment and processes them according to  the   individual’s   preconceived   concept   of   what   is   important.   Other   factors   can   influence   the   reception   of   information   by   sensory  memory. For example, if the input is dramatic and impacts more than one of the five senses, that information is more likely to make  an impression. The sensory memory processes stimuli from the environment within seconds, discards what is considered extraneous,  and processes what is determined by the individual to be relevant. This is a selective process where the sensory register is set to  recognize certain stimuli and immediately transmit them to the STM for action. The process is called precoding. An example of  sensory precoding is recognition of a fire alarm. No matter what is happening at the time, when the sensory register detects a fire  alarm, the working memory is immediately made aware of the alarm and preset responses begin to take place. Sensory memory is  capable of retaining information for only a very short period of time and within seconds the relevant information is passed to the  STM.  

# Short-Term Memory (STM)  

Short-term memory is the part of the memory system where information is stored for roughly 30 seconds, after which it may rapidly  fade or be consolidated into long-term   memory,   depending   on   the   individual’s   priorities.   Several   common   steps   help   retention   in   STM. These include rehearsal or repetition of the information and sorting or categorization into systematic chunks. The sorting  process is usually called coding or chunking. A key limitation of STM is that it takes 5–10 seconds to properly code information and  if the coding process is interrupted, that information is easily lost since it is stored for only 30 seconds. The goal of the STM is to put  the information to immediate use.  

STM is not only time-limited, it also has limited capacity, usually about seven bits or chunks of information. A seven-digit  telephone number is an example. As indicated, the time limitation may be overcome by rehearsal. This means learning the  information by a rote memorization process. Of course, rote memorization is subject to imperfections in both the duration of recall  and in its accuracy. The coding process is more useful in a learning situation. In addition, the coding process may involve recoding to  adjust the information to individual experiences. This is when actual learning begins to take place. Therefore, recoding may be  described as a process of relating incoming information to concepts or knowledge already in memory.  

Brain research has led to the conclusion that STM resembles the control tower of a major airport and is responsible for scheduling  and coordinating all incoming and outgoing flights. STM has three basic operations: iconic memory, acoustic memory, and working  memory. Iconic memory is the brief sensory memory of visual images. Acoustic memory is the encoded memory of a brief sound  memory or the ability to hold sounds in STM. Of the two, acoustic memory can be held longer than iconic memory. Working memory  is an active process to keep information until it is put to use (think of a phone number repeated until used). It is useful in remembering  a spoken sentence or a string of digits.  

Also   called   “scratch-pad”   memory,   working   memory   is   of   short   duration   and   has   limited   capacity.    simultaneously   stores   and   manipulates information. The goal of the working memory is not really to move the information from STM to LTM, but merely put  the information to immediate use.  

STM retention makes information available long enough for it to be rehearsed. For example, if the learner repeats the number to  himself, it can be transferred to some sort of longer term storage. To retain information for extended periods of time, it needs to be  transferred from STM to LTM. This process involves encoding or consolidation of information into LTM where it can then be  retrieved.  

# Long-Term Memory (LTM)  

LTM is relatively permanent storage of unlimited information, and it is possible for memories in LTM to remain there for a lifetime.  What   is   stored   in   LTM   affects   a person’s   perceptions   of   the   world   and   affects   what   information   in   the   environment   is   noticed.   Information that passes from STM to LTM typically has some significance attached to it. For example, imagine how difficult it would  be   for   a pilot   to   forget   the   first   day   he   or   she   soloed.   This    a significant   day   in   any   pilot’s   training,   so   when   the   information was  processed, significance was attached to it, the information was deemed important, and it was transferred into LTM.  

There appear to be other reasons information is transferred to LTM because the average human brain stores numerous insignificant  facts. One explanation is repetition; people tend to remember things the more they are rehearsed. Information also ends up in LTM  because it is somehow attached to something significant. A person may remember the color of the clothing of the recipient of a  wedding proposal. The color of the clothing plays no important role, but is attached to the memory of the experience.  

For the stored information to be useful, some special effort was expended during the encoding or consolidation of information in  STM. The encoding should provide meaning and connections between old and new information. If initial encoding is not properly  accomplished, recall is distorted and it may be impossible. The more effective the encoding process, the easier the recall. However, it  should be noted that the LTM is a reconstruction, not a pure recall of information or events. It is also subject to limitations, such as  time, biases, and, in many cases, personal inaccuracies. This is one reason why two people who view the same event often have  totally different recollections. Memory also applies to psychomotor skills. For example, with practice, a tennis player may be able to  serve a tennis ball at a high rate of speed and with accuracy. This may be accomplished with very little thought. For a pilot, the ability  to instinctively perform certain maneuvers or tasks that require manual dexterity and precision, provides obvious benefits. For  example, it allows the pilot more time to concentrate on other essential duties such as navigation, communications with ATC  facilities, and visual scanning for other aircraft.  

Information in LTM is stored in interrelated networks of schemas which are the cognitive frameworks that help people organize and  interpret information. Schemas guide recognition and understanding of new information by providing expectations about what should  occur. Since LTM is organized into schemas, instructors should consciously look for ways to make training relevant and meaningful  enough for the learner to transfer new information to LTM. This can be accomplished by activating existing schemas before  presenting new information. For example, a brief review of the previous lesson via discussion, video, questions, etc.  

# Remembering What Has Been Learned  

The moment people learn something new and add it to their repertoire of knowledge and skill, they are confronted with a second task:  the task of remembering it. Remembering is a challenge because of a natural feature of human memory-forgetting. Forgetting is such  an apparent part of human memory that it is often the first thing that people think of when they bring up the topic of memory.  

The following section discusses how remembering and forgetting happens in predictable ways that help keep human memories tuned  to the demands of everyday life. Memories help people keep fresh precisely those things needed next, and let slip those things that  have outlived their usefulness. Understanding the factors that determine what is remembered and what is forgotten helps instructor  and learner get the most from memory.  

# How Usage Affects Memory  

The ability to retrieve knowledge or skills from memory is primarily related to two things: (1) how often that knowledge has been  used in the past; and (2) how recently the knowledge has been used. These two factors are called frequency and recency of use.  Frequency and recency can be present individually or in combination.  

Frequency and recency—knowledge that enjoys both frequency and recency is likely to be retrieved easily and quickly. This is  knowledge much used in the past that continues to be used in the present. This is the ideal situation for knowledge and skills that need  to be used.  

Frequency only—knowledge that has been used much in the past but that has not been used recently is vulnerable to being forgotten.  This type of knowledge is likely to be retrieved slowly or not at all. To retrieve this knowledge and skill, some recent rehearsal or  practice needs to be added in order to refresh the memory.  

Recency only—knowledge that has been recently used but has not been used in the past is knowledge that has been recently acquired.  This type of knowledge is particularly vulnerable to being forgotten since there is little to distinguish it from “throw away”   knowledge, such as an hourly weather broadcast. To remember this knowledge requires a program of regular rehearsal to build up its  frequency.  

# Forgetting  

Forgetting, which refers to loss of a memory, typically involves a failure in memory retrieval. The failure may be due to the decay or  overwriting of information which has been temporarily stored in STM, but generally forgetting refers to loss of information from  LTM.   The information    not lost, per   se,   it is   somewhere in   the person’s   LTM,   but he or   she is   not able to   retrieve and   remember it.  

Why   do   people forget?   Why   don’t we remember   everything?   Do   we need   to   remember   everything?   Most of   the information   people  are exposed to each day has a short period of usefulness with little need to retain it. For example, why would anyone need to  remember the details of an hourly weather broadcast ten years ago?  

Thus, forgetting knowledge is not always a bad thing. For example, forgetting old information keeps new information up to date.  Many theories on why people forget have been offered to explain the phenomenon, among them retrieval failure, fading, interference,  and repression or suppression.  

# Retrieval Failure  

Retrieval failure is simply the inability to retrieve information, that tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon when a person knows the meaning  of a word, or the answer to a question, but cannot retrieve it. It is also caused by the fact that sometimes people simply do not encode  information well and the information never makes it to LTM or is lost before it can attach itself to the LTM. This is sometimes  referred to as failure to store.  

# Fading  

The theory of fading or decay suggests that a person forgets information that is not used for an extended period of time, that it fades  away or decays. It had been suggested that humans are physiologically preprogrammed to eventually erase data that no longer appears  pertinent.  

On the other hand, experimental studies show that a hypnotized person can describe specific details of an event, which normally is  beyond recall. Apparently the memory is there, locked in the recesses of the mind. The difficulty is summoning the memory to  consciousness or retrieving the link that leads to it.  

# Interference  

Interference theory suggests that people forget something because a certain experience has overshadowed it, or that the learning of  similar things has intervened. This theory might explain how the range of experiences after graduation from school causes a person to  forget or to lose knowledge. In other words, new events displace many things that had been learned. From experiments, at least two  conclusions about interference may be drawn. First, similar material seems to interfere with memory more than dissimilar material;  and second, material not well learned suffers most from interference.  

# Repression or Suppression  

Freudian psychology advances the view that some forgetting is caused by repression or suppression. In repression or suppression, a  memory is pushed out of reach because the individual does not want to remember the feelings associated with it. Repression is an  unconscious form of forgetting while suppression is a conscious form.  

Forgetting information does not mean it is gone forever. Sometimes it is still there, just inaccessible.  

# Retention of Learning  

Each of the theories of forgetting implies that when a person forgets something, it is not actually lost. Rather, it is simply unavailable  for   recall.   The instructor’s   problem    how   to   make certain   that the learner’s   learning    readily   available for   recall.   The following  suggestions can help.  

Teach thoroughly and with meaning. Material thoroughly learned is highly resistant to forgetting. This is suggested by experimental  studies and it also was pointed out in the sections on skill learning. Meaningful learning builds patterns of relationships in the  learner’s   consciousness,   which   is   one reason   to   conduct SBT.   In   contrast, rote learning   is   superficial and   is   not easily   retained.  Meaningful learning   goes deep   because it involves principles and   concepts   anchored    the learner’s   own   experiences.   The following  discussion emphasizes five principles, which are generally accepted as having a direct application to remembering.  

# Praise Stimulates Remembering  

Responses that give a pleasurable return tend to be repeated. Absence of praise or recognition tends to discourage, and any form of  negativism in the acceptance of a response tends to make its recall less likely.  

# Recall Is Promoted by Association  

As discussed earlier, each bit of information or action, which is associated with something to be learned, tends to facilitate its later  recall by the learner. Unique or disassociated facts tend to be forgotten unless they are of special interest or application.  

# Favorable Attitudes Aid Retention  

People learn and remember only what they wish to know. Without motivation there is little chance for recall. The most effective  motivation is based on positive or rewarding objectives.  

# Learning with All Senses Is Most Effective  

Although people generally receive what is learned through the eyes and ears, other senses also contribute to most perceptions. When  several senses respond together, a fuller understanding and greater chance of recall is achieved.  

# Meaningful Repetition Aids Recall  

Each repetition gives the learner an opportunity to gain a clearer and more accurate perception of the subject to be learned, but mere  repetition does not guarantee retention. Practice provides an opportunity for learning, but does not cause it. Further, some research  indicates that three or four repetitions provide the maximum effect, after which the rate of learning and probability of retention fall off  rapidly.  

Along with these five principles, there is a considerable amount of additional literature on retention of learning during a typical  academic lesson. After the first 10–15 minutes, the rate of retention drops significantly until about the last 5–10 minutes when  learners wake up again. Learners passively listening to a lecture have roughly a five percent retention rate over a 24-hour period, but  individuals actively engaged in the learning process have a much higher retention. This clearly reiterates the point that active learning  is superior to just listening.  

# Mnemonics  

A mnemonic uses a pattern of letters, ideas, visual images, or associations to assist in remembering information. It is a memory  enhancing strategy that involves teaching learners to link new information to information they already know. Its chief value lies in  helping learners recall information that needs to be recalled in a particular order by encoding difficult-to-remember information in a  way that makes it easier to remember. Research shows that providing learners with memorization techniques improves their ability to  recall information. Mnemonics include but are not limited to acronyms, acrostics, rhymes, or chaining.  

Acronyms   form   a word   from   the first letters   of   other   words.   For   example,   “AIM”   is   the acronym   for   Aeronautical Information   Manual.  

An acrostic is a poem, word puzzle, or other composition in which the first letter of each line or word is a cue to the idea the learner  wishes to remember. For example, Every Good Boy Does Fine is used to remember the order of the G-clef notes in music. An  example of   a useful aviation   acrostic is   the memory   aid   for   one of   the magnetic compass   errors.   The letters   “ANDS” indicate:  

⦁  Accelerate  ⦁  North  ⦁  Decelerate  ⦁  South  

Rhymes and   melody   are another   way   to   remember   information.   Rhymes such   as “In   1492,   Columbus   sailed   the ocean   blue.” Most  children   learn   the alphabet using   a familiar   melody   “Twinkle,   Twinkle,   Little Star.” A   well-known mnemonic rhyme for remembering  the days   of   the month    the familiar,    $^{\circ}30$    days   hath   September,   April, June,   and   November...”  

Chaining is used for ordered or unordered lists and consists of creating a story in which each word or idea that needs to be  remembered cues the next idea.  

Variations of the encoding process are practically endless. Developing a logical strategy for encoding information is a significant step  in the learning process.  

# Transfer of Learning  

Transfer of learning is broadly defined as the ability to apply knowledge or procedures learned in one context to new contexts.  Learning occurs more quickly and he or she develops a deeper understanding of the task if he or she brings some knowledge or skills  from previous learning. A positive transfer of learning occurs when the individual practices under a variety of conditions,  underscoring again the value of SBT.  

A distinction is commonly made between near and far transfer. Near transfer consists of transfer from initial learning that is situated  in a given setting to ones that are closely related. Far transfer refers both to the ability to use what was learned in one setting to a  different one as well as the ability to solve novel problems that share a common structure with the knowledge initially acquired. There  is a third way to talk about transfer called generativity. In this context it means learners have the ability on their own to come up with  novel solutions.  

During a learning experience, previous knowledge usually aids the learner, but sometimes interferes with the current task. Consider  the learning of two skills. If the learning of skill A helps to learn skill B, positive transfer occurs. If learning skill A hinders the  learning of skill B, negative transfer occurs. For example, the practice of slow flight (skill A) helps Beverly learn short-field landings  (skill B). However, practice in making a landing approach in an airplane (skill A) may hinder learning to make an approach in a  helicopter (skill B). It should be noted that the learning of skill B might affect the retention or proficiency of skill A, either positively  or negatively. While these processes may help substantiate the interference theory of forgetting, they are still concerned with the  transfer of learning.  

It is clear that some degree of transfer is involved in all learning. This is true because, except for certain inherent responses, all new  learning is based upon previous experience. People interpret new things in terms of what they already know.  

Many aspects of teaching profit by this type of transfer, perhaps explaining why learners of apparently equal ability have differing  success in certain areas. Negative transfer may hinder the learning of some; positive transfer may help others. This points to a need to  know   the learner’s   past experience   and   current knowledge.   In   lesson   and   syllabus   development, instructors   can   plan   for   transfer by  organizing course materials and individual lesson materials in a meaningful sequence. Each phase should help the learner understand  what is to follow.  

The cause of transfer and exactly how it occurs is difficult to determine, but no one disputes the fact that transfer occurs. For the  instructor, the significance of transference lies in the fact that the learners can be helped to achieve it. The following suggestions are  representative of what educational psychologists believe should be done:  

⦁  Plan for transfer as a primary objective. As in all areas of teaching, the chance for success is increased if      the instructor deliberately plans to achieve it.  ⦁  Ensure that the learners understand that information can be applied to other situations. Prepare them to      seek other applications.  ⦁  Maintain high-order learning standards. Overlearning may be appropriate. The more thoroughly      the learners understand the material, the more likely they are to see its relationship to new situations.  ⦁  Avoid unnecessary rote learning, since it does not foster transfer.  ⦁  Provide meaningful learning experiences that build confidence in their ability to transfer knowledge. This      suggests activities that challenge them to exercise their imagination and ingenuity in applying their      knowledge and skills.  ⦁  Use instructional material that helps form valid concepts and generalizations. Use materials that make      relationships clear.  

# Habit Formation  

The formation of correct habit patterns from the beginning of any learning process is essential to further learning and for correct  performance after the completion of training. Remember, primacy is one of the fundamental principles of learning. Therefore, it is the  instructor’s   responsibility    insist on   correct techniques and   procedures from   the outset of   training    provide proper   habit patterns. It  is much easier to foster proper habits from the beginning of training than to correct faulty ones later.  

Due to the high level of knowledge and skill required in aviation for both pilots and maintenance technicians, training has  traditionally followed a building block concept. This means new learning and habit patterns are based on a solid foundation of  experience and/or old learning. Everything from intricate cognitive processes to simple motor skills depends on what the learner  already knows and how that knowledge can be applied in the present. As knowledge and skill increase, there is an expanding base  upon which to build for the future.  

# How Understanding Affects Memory  

The ability to remember is greatly affected by the level of understanding of what has been learned. Many studies have demonstrated a  depth-of-processing effect on memory: the more deeply humans think about what they have learned, the more likely they are able to  retrieve that knowledge later. Depth-of-processing is the natural result of the kinds of learning activities described earlier: beginning  with memorized information and then elaborating upon it, making associations, constructing explanations, all in pursuit of furthering  understanding.  

The effects of depth of processing on memory are quite powerful and result from even the simplest attempts to elaborate on what has  been   learned.   One study   asked   participants   to   memorize sentences   such   as “The pilot arrived   late.” Half   of   the participants   simply  memorized   the sentences   as they   were.   The other   participants   were asked   to   develop   an   elaboration   for   the sentence   such   as “because  of   the bad   weather.”  

When put to a test, participants who created elaborations were significantly better able to recall the sentences. When memories for  sentences had decayed, it seems that remembered words from the elaborations helped people recall them.  

# Remembering during Training  

Remembering what is learned on a day-to-day basis is the first challenge learners need to meet. As learners are presented with new  knowledge each day, they should work to maintain that new knowledge plus all the knowledge they learned on previous days. Indeed,  remembering during training is a challenge that increases in magnitude each day.  

The first threat to newly acquired knowledge is a lack of frequent usage in the past. To address this threat, the learner needs to engage  in   regular   practice of   what they   have learned.   Learners   often   put off   daily   studying   in   favor   of   “cramming” the night before an  evaluation. These learners should be made aware that shorter and regularly spaced study sessions produce memory results that far  exceed those obtained from cramming.  

A second threat to newly acquired knowledge exists if a learner lacks the degree of understanding that may assist with the recall of  that knowledge.   Study   practices that combine repetition   of   knowledge along   with   efforts   to   increase one’s   understanding   of   the  knowledge lead    best results.   The idea   of   reading   with   “study   questions” in   mind    one that has received   much   attention   by   memory  researchers.  

Experiments have found that not only does answering study questions lead to better memory, but so does the very act of creating  study questions. In one experiment in which learners read a text and were then tested on their comprehension, learners who wrote  their own study questions and then discarded them unanswered exhibited better recall than learners who simply read the text.  

# Remembering after Training  

Learners should leave the training environment with a sound understanding that a certificate is in no sense a guarantee that they will  remember anything that they have learned. It seems that no one is exempt from the process of forgetting. Continued practice of their  knowledge and skill is the only means of retaining what they learned, and practice is important after they become certificated pilots  and mechanics as it is during their training.  

One study   of   pilots’   retention   of   aeronautical knowledge showed   that learners’   retention   of   some topics was superior   to   that of their  own   instructors.   It seems   that the learners’   active use and   recent rehearsal of   these knowledge topics in   preparation   for   knowledge and  practical tests outweighed the effects of the more frequent (but less recent) usage on the part of the instructors. This finding nicely  demonstrates that an   instructor’s   knowledge is   just as   vulnerable to   forgetting   when   it has not been   recently   practiced.  

In the same study, the ability of certificated pilots to remember details about regulations was related to the number of months since  each   pilot’s   last   flight review.   This   suggests   that pilots   may   take steps   to   sharpen   their   knowledge before a flight review   and allow it  to decay between reviews. Even skills that become automatic during training may not remain automatic after a period of disuse.  

# Sources of Knowledge  

Aviation learners obtain knowledge from a variety of sources while training to be pilots or mechanics. The aviation instructor is the  learner’s   primary   source   of   knowledge,   but an   instructor   also   recommends   other   sources   of   knowledge.   These include books,   photographs, videos, diagrams and charts, and other instructional materials. These sources are important for the learner because they  allow information to be archived and easily transferred from one person to another. They also allow the reader to self-pace the  acquisition of information and permit the reader to pause, think, formulate, and reformulate his or her understanding.  

The instructor also encourages the learner to gain experience in the real-world   of   aviation.   These experiences   enhance   the learner’s   incidental learning: observation of other pilots or mechanics, thinking about what has been learned, formulation of schemas, and  ability to make correlations about what has been learned. Interactive computer-based instruction programs, another excellent source  of knowledge, often go hand-in-hand with the flight training syllabus, assuring academics are delivered just-in-time to complement  lessons.  

# Summary of Instructor Actions  

To help learners remember what they have learned, the instructor should:  

⦁  Discuss the difference between short-term memory and long-term memory.  ⦁  Explain the effect of frequent and recent usage of knowledge on remembering and forgetting.  ⦁  Explain the effect of depth of understanding on remembering and forgetting.  ⦁  Encourage learner use of mnemonic devices while studying.  ⦁  Explain   the benefits   of   studying   at regularly   spaced   intervals, and   the disadvantages of   “cramming.”  

# Chapter Summary  

Learning theory has caused instruction to move from basic skills and pure facts to linking new information with prior knowledge,  from relying on a single authority to recognizing multiple sources of knowledge, and from novice-like to expert-like problem-solving.  While educational theories facilitate learning, no one learning theory is good for all learning situations and all learners. Instruction in  aviation should utilize a combination of learning theories.  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 4: Effective Communication  

# Introduction  

Carol, a  fl ight  i nstructor, has planned the first tailwheel flight with Jacob, her learner pilot. She begins the preflight briefing with an  explanation of the tendency of tailwheel aircraft to yaw in normal takeoff. This yawing tendency gives the illusion that the  tailwheel aircraft is unstable during the takeoff. Since this yawing tendency occurs on every takeoff, it is predictable and the pilot is  able to compensate for it. Carol then discusses the precession, which causes the noticeable yaw when the tail is raised from a three- point attitude to a level flight attitude. This change of attitude tilts the horizontal axis of the propeller, and the resulting  precession   produces   a forward   force   on   the right side (  $90^{\circ}$   ahead    the direction   of   rotation),   yawing   the aircraft’s   nose to   the left. To  demonstrate the yawing tendency, she places a model aircraft prop under a desk lamp.  [Figure 4-1]  By moving the prop, the shadow  it casts illustrates the pitch change of the propeller when the aircraft is on its tailwheel and when the aircraft is raised to a level flight  attitude.

Figure 4-1.  An   aviation   instructor   communicates with   her learner using   model airplanes to   ensure the learner’s understanding   of the  principles discussed.  

Effective communication is an essential element of instruction. An aviation instructor may possess a high level of technical  knowledge, but he or she needs to cultivate the ability to communicate effectively in order to share this knowledge with learners.  Although communication is a complex process, aviation instructors need to develop a comfortable style of communication that meets  the goal of passing on desired information to learners.  

Communicating effectively is based on similarity of the idea transmitted by the source and received by the receiver. Similarly, as the  source, instructors have communicated effectively if the learner has understood the idea/concept/action transmitted in the manner in  which it was intended to be understood.  

It is also important to recognize that communication is a two-way process. Each instructor and learner may have a unique  communication style, and bridging the gap between these styles is an important aspect of providing instruction. The elements of  effective communication, the barriers to communication, and the development of communication skills are discussed in this chapter.  

# Basic Elements of Communication  

Communication takes place when one person transmits ideas or feelings to another person or group of people. The effectiveness of  the communication is measured by the similarity between the idea transmitted and the idea received. The process of communication is  composed of three elements:  

⦁  Source (sender, speaker, writer, encoder, transmitter, or instructor)  ⦁  Symbols used in composing and transmitting the message (words or signs [model prop/desk lamp in  Figure  4-1])   ⦁  Receiver (listener, reader, decoder, or learner)  

The three elements are dynamically interrelated since each element is dependent on the others for effective communication to take  place. The relationship between the source and the receiver is also dynamic and depends on the two-way flow of symbols between the  source and the receiver. The source depends on feedback from the receiver to properly tailor the communication to the situation. The  source also provides feedback to the receiver to reinforce the desired receiver responses.  

# Source  

As indicated, the source in communication is the sender, speaker, writer, encoder, transmitter, or instructor. The effectiveness of  persons acting in the role of communicators is related to at least three basic factors.  

First, their ability to select and use language is essential for transmitting symbols that are meaningful to listeners and readers. It is the  responsibility of the speaker or writer, as the source of communication, to realize that the effectiveness of the communication is  dependent   on   the   receiver’s   understanding   of   the   symbols   or   words   being   used.   For   example,    an   aviation   maintenance   instructor  were to use aviation acronyms like ADs, TCDS or STCs or a flight instructor were to use aviation acronyms like ILS, TCAS, or  TAWS with a new maintenance learner or learner pilot respectively, effective communication would be difficult if not impossible.  

Second, communicators consciously or unconsciously reveal information about themselves. This includes their self-image, their view  of the ideas being communicated, and their feelings toward the receivers. Communicators need to be confident; they should  illustrate that the message is important, and that the receivers have a need to know the ideas presented.  

Third, successful communicators speak or write from accurate, up-to-date, and stimulating material. Communicators should convey  the   most   current   and   interesting   information   available.   Doing   so   holds   the   receiver’s   interest.   Out-of-date information causes the  instructor    lose credibility,   and   uninteresting   information   may   cause the receiver’s   attention    be lost.  

# Symbols  

At its basic level, all communication is achieved through symbols, which are simple oral, visual, or tactile codes. The words in the  vocabulary constitute a basic code. Common gestures and facial expressions form another, but codes and symbols alone do not  communicate complex concepts. These are communicated only when symbols are combined in meaningful wholes as ideas,  sentences, paragraphs, speeches, or chapters that mean something to the receiver. When symbols are combined into these units, each  portion becomes important to effective communication.  

On a higher level, communication with symbols relies upon different perceptions, sometimes referred to as channels. While many  theories have been proposed, one popular theory indicates that the symbols are perceived through one of three sensory channels:  visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. As discussed in Chapter 3, visual learners rely on seeing, auditory learners prefer listening and  speaking, while kinesthetic learners process and store information through physical experience such as touching, manipulating, using,  or doing.  

The instructor   may   gain   and   retain   the learner’s   attention   by   using   a variety   of   channels. As   an   example,   instead   of   telling   a learner to  adjust the trim, the instructor can move the trim wheel while the learner tries to maintain a given aircraft attitude. The learner  experiences by feel that the trim wheel affects the amount of control pressure needed to maintain the attitude. At the same time, the  instructor can explain to the learner that what is felt is forward or back pressure on the controls. After that, the learner begins to  understand the correct meaning of control pressure and trim, and when told to adjust the trim to relieve control pressure, the learner  responds in the manner desired by the instructor. Instructors commonly rely on the hearing and seeing channels of communication.  However, using all channels may improve the learning process. For teaching motor skills, the sense of touch, or kinesthetic learning,  is added as the learner practices the skill.  

An instructor should constantly monitor feedback from the learner in order to identify misunderstandings and tailor the presentation  of information. Periodically asking the learner to explain his or her understanding of new information while it is being conveyed is  one way to obtain such feedback. The instructor may then modify the symbols he or she uses, as appropriate, to optimize  communication.  [Figure   $_{4-2J}$  In addition to feedback received by the instructor, learners also need feedback from the instructor on  how they are doing. The feedback not only informs the learners of their performance, but can also serve as a valuable source of  motivation.   An   instructor’s   praise builds   the learner’s   self-confidence and reinforces favorable behavior. On the other hand, negative  feedback should be used carefully. To avoid embarrassing a learner, use negative feedback only in private. This information should  be delivered as a description of actual performance and given in a nonjudgmental manner.  

![](images/fbe6930672fabdf064433c8a22dd23754d9efedb5495ec5c4717cb47f068493b.jpg)  
Figure 4-2.  The instructor   realizes from the response of the learner that “stall”   has   been   interpreted   by the learner to   have   something to do with the engine quitting. Recognizing that the learner has misunderstood, the instructor is able to clarify the information and  help the learner to obtain the desired outcome.  

For example, it would be appropriate to tell a maintenance learner that a safety wire installation is not satisfactory. To refer to the  work   as careless   would   not be good   and   could   do   harm    the learner’s   feeling   of   self-worth.  

The parts of the total idea should be analyzed to determine which are most suited to starting or ending the communication, and which  are best for the purpose of explaining, clarifying, or emphasizing. All of these functions are required for effective transmission of  ideas. The process finally culminates in the determination of the medium best suited for their transmission.  

# Receiver  

The receiver is the listener, reader, decoder, or learner—the individual or individuals to whom the message is directed. Effective  communicators should always keep in mind that communication succeeds only in relation to the reaction of their receivers. When the  receiver reacts with understanding and changes his or her behavior according to the intent of the source, effective communication has  taken place.  

In order to understand the process of communication, three characteristics of receivers need to be understood: abilities, attitudes, and  experiences.  

First, an instructor needs to determine the abilities of the learner in order to properly communicate. One factor that can have an effect  on learner ability is his or her background. For example, consider how familiar the learner may be with aviation. The familiarity may  range from having grown up around aviation to absolutely no familiarity at all. Some learners may have highly developed motor  skills, and others have not had opportunities to develop these skills. These factors should be taken into consideration when presenting  information to a learner.  

The instructor should also understand that the viewpoint and background of people may vary because of cultural differences. The  instructor should be aware of possible differences, but not overreact or make assumptions because of these differences. For example,  just because a learner    a college graduate does not guarantee rapid   advancement in   aviation   training.    learner’s   education   certainly  affects   the instructor’s   style of   presentation,   but that style should   be based   on   the evaluation   of   the learner’s   knowledge of the aviation  subject being taught.  

Second, the attitudes learners exhibit may indicate resistance, willingness, or passive neutrality. To gain and hold learner attention,  attitudes should be molded into forms that promote reception of information. A varied communicative approach works best in  reaching most learners since they have different attitudes.  

Third, instructors in aviation enjoy a unique advantage over other teachers, in that an aviation learner is usually an adult willing to  expend time and money to further knowledge. The typical aviation learner exhibits a much more developed sense of motivation and  self-concept than a typical school learner. Additionally, he or she usually comes into the learning environment with a significant  amount of prior knowledge, many life experiences, and a number of decision-making skills. The learner's knowledge, abilities, and  attitudes affect the instructor's communication strategy.  

# Barriers to Effective Communication  

It is essential to understand the dynamics of communication, but the instructor also needs to be aware of several barriers to  communication that can inhibit learning. The nature of language and the way it is used often lead to misunderstandings. These  misunderstandings can be identified by four barriers to effective communication: lack of common experience, confusion between the  symbol and the symbolized object, overuse of abstractions, and external factors.  [Figure 4-3]  

# Lack of Common Experience  

Lack of common experience between the communicator (instructor) and the receiver (learner) is probably the greatest single barrier to  effective communication. Communication can be effective only to the extent that the experiences (physical, mental, and emotional) of  the participants are similar.  

Many people seem to believe that words transport meanings from speaker to listener in the same way that a truck carries bricks from  one location to another. Words, however, rarely carry precisely the same meaning from the mind of the instructor to the mind of the  learner. In fact, words, in themselves, do not transfer meanings at all. Whether spoken or written, words are merely stimuli used to  arouse a response in the learner.  

![](images/70cf696de42684f088d38c4fafd434be0d406f791ffcf5ca6e827164b9c51dfd.jpg)  
Figure 4-3.  Misunderstandings stem primarily from four barriers to effective communication.  

The learner’s   past experience   with   the words   and   things   to   which   they   refer   determines how   the learner   responds   to   what the  instructor   says.   An   instructor’s   words   cannot communicate   the desired   meaning   to   another   person   unless   the learner   has had   some  experience   with   the objects   or   concepts    which   these words   refer.   Since   it is   the learners’   experience   that forms   vocabulary, it is also  essential that instructors   speak   the same language as the learners.   When   the instructor’s   terminology    necessary   to   convey   the idea,  some time needs to be spent making certain the learners understand that terminology.  

For example, a maintenance instructor tells a learner to time the magnetos. A learner new to the maintenance field might think a  stopwatch or clock would be necessary to do the requested task. Instruction would be necessary for the learner to understand that the  procedure has nothing to do with the usual concept of time.  

The English language abounds in words that mean different things to different people. To a farmer, the word “tractor” means the  machine that pulls the implements to cultivate the soil; to a trucker, it is the vehicle used to pull a semitrailer; in aviation, a tractor  propeller is the opposite of a pusher propeller. Each technical field has its own vocabulary. Technical words might mean something  entirely different to a person outside that field, or perhaps mean nothing at all. In order for communication to be effective, the  learners’   understanding   of   the meaning   of   the words   needs    be the same as the instructor’s   understanding.  

When either the instructor, the learner, or both utilize English as a second language, the instructor notes whether this creates a  significant barrier to communication. Except in cases of special accommodation for a medical disabil i ty, any learner seeking a  pilot certificate or a maintenance learner seeking to become an AMT with operating privileges in the United States demonst r ates the  ability to communicate in English before certification or exercise of privilege. If reasonable doubt exists as to the ability of an  aviation learner to communicate in English at an appropriate level, the instructor should refer to Advisory Circular (AC) 60-28,  FAA  English Language Standard for an FAA Certificate Issued Under 14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, and 107 , for further guidance.  

# Confusion Between the Symbol and the Symbolized Object  

Confusion between the symbol and the symbolized object results when a word is confused with what it is meant to represent.  Although it is obvious that words and the connotations they carry can be different, people sometimes fail to make the distinction. An  aviation maintenance technician (AMT) might be introduced as a mechanic. To many people, the term mechanic conjures up images  of   a person   laboring   over   an   automobile.   Being   referred   to   as an   aircraft mechanic might be an   improvement in   some people’s   minds,  but neither really portrays the training and skill of the AMT. Words and symbols do not always represent the same thing to every  person. To communicate effectively, speakers and writers should account for possible misinterpretation. Words and symbols can then  be chosen to represent what the speaker or writer intends.  

# Overuse of Abstractions  

Abstractions are words that are general rather than specific. Concrete words or terms refer to objects people can relate directly to their  own experiences. These words or terms specify an idea that can be perceived or a thing that can be visualized. Abstract words, on the  other hand, stand for ideas that cannot be directly experienced, things that do not call forth mental images in the minds of the learners.  The word aircraft is an abstract word. It does not call to mind a specific aircraft. One learner may visualize an airplane, while another  might visualize a helicopter, and still another learner might visualize an airship.  [Figure 4-4]  Although the word airplane is more  specific, various learners might envision anything from a Boeing 777 to a Piper Cub.  

![](images/2458a26fe94c558f087623b1588521a279728fb158ff80757f77f485401c023d.jpg)  
Figure 4-4.  Overuse of abstract terms can interfere with effective communication.  

Aircraft engines represent another example of abstractions. When an instructor refers to aircraft engines in general, some learners  might think of jet engines, while others would think of reciprocating engines. Even reciprocating engine is too abstract since it could  be a radial engine, an inline engine, a V-type engine, or an opposed type engine. Use of the technical language of engines, as in  Lycoming IO-360, would narrow the engine type, but would only be understood by learners who understand the terminology  particular to aircraft engines.  

Abstractions should be avoided in most cases, but there are times when abstractions are necessary and useful. Aerodynamics is  applicable to all aircraft and is an example of an abstraction that can lead to understanding aircraft flight characteristics. The danger  of abstractions is that they do not evoke the same specific items of experience in the minds of the learners that the instructor intends.  When such terms are used, they should be linked with specific experiences through examples and illustrations.  

For instance, when an approach to landing is going badly, telling a learner to take appropriate measures might not result in the desired  action. It would be better to tell the learner to conduct a go-around since this is an action that has the same meaning. When  maintenance learners are being taught to torque the bolts on an engine, it would be better to tell them to torque the bolts in accordance  with the maintenance manual for that engine rather than simply to torque the bolts to the proper values. Whenever possible, the level  of abstraction should be reduced by using concrete, specific terms. This better defines and gains control of images produced in the  minds of the learners.  

# External Factors  

Some barriers to effective communication can be controlled by the instructor. Others are external factors outside of the instructor’s   control that prevent a process or activity from being carried out properly. These factors may include physiological, environmental,  and psychological elements. To communicate effectively, the instructor should consider the effects of these factors and mitigate them  where possible.  

Physiological external factors include biological conditions such as hearing loss, injury, physical illness, or other congenital  condition. These physiological factors may cause learner discomfort and inhibit communication. The instructor should adapt the  presentation to allow the learner to feel better about the situation and be more receptive to new ideas. Adaptation could be as simple  as putting off a lesson until the learner is over an illness. Another accommodation could be the use of a seat cushion to allow a learner  to sit properly in the airplane.  

With the advent of more sophisticated technology, multitasking has become a form of physiological external factors. The term  multitask   comes from   a computer’s   ability   to   simultaneously   execute more than   one program   or   task   at a time.   Although   it now   refers  to humans performing multiple tasks simultaneously, humans are not computers. Research shows that although human comprehension  can handle two simple, low-level cognitive tasks at once, a higher level cognitive task takes brain function and concentration to  perform optimally. Adding even a simple activity diminishes the comprehension and recall of both. Research shows that multitasking  is just a series of constant micro-interruptions   and   “stop-go” decisions,   all of   which   tend    reduce   mental and   motor   performance.  

Environmental external factors are caused by external physical conditions. One example of this is the noise level found in many light  aircraft. Noise not only impairs the communication process, but also can result in long-term damage to hearing. One solution to this  problem is the use of headphones and an intercom system. If an intercom system is not available, a good solution is the use of  earplugs. It has been shown that in addition to protecting hearing, use of earplugs actually clarifies speaker output. Vibration is  another possible example of environmental external factors, applicable to rotary wing aircraft.  

A psychological external factor is a product of how the instructor and learner feel at the time the communication process is occurring.  If either instructor or learner is not committed to the communication process, communication is impaired. Fear of the situation or  mistrust between the instructor and learner disrupts communication and severely inhibits the flow of information.  

# Interference  

Interference occurs when the message gets disrupted, tru n cated, or added to somewhere in the communication sequence. While the  instructor or learner may believe that an intact message has been sent and received, the assumption may be inaccurate. Noise and  other factors may distort the message. Psychological factors also interfere with the receipt of a message. Instructors and learners  confirm the message and its proper commun i cation when observing the effect of a message. Additional feedback and confirmation  reduce potential harmful effects from interfere nce.  

# Developing Communication Skills  

Communication skills need to be developed; they do not occur automatically. The ability to effectively communicate stems from  experience. The experience of instructional communication begins with role playing during training to be an instructor, continues  during the actual instruction, and is enhanced by additional training.  

# Role Playing  

Role playing is a method of learning in which learners perform a particular role. In role playing, the learner is provided with a general  description of a situation and then applies a new skill or knowledge to perform the role. Experience in instructional communication  comes from actually doing it and is learned in the beginning by role playing during the instructor’s initial training. For example, a  flight instructor applicant can fly with a  flight instructor   who assumes the role of a learner pilot. In this role, the  flight instructor   can  duplicate known learner responses   and then critique the applicant’s role as instructor. A mentor or supervisor can play the learner  AMT for a maintenance instructor applicant.  

It is essential for the flight instructor to develop good ground instruction skills, as well as flight instruction skills to prepare learners  for what is to transpire in the air. Likewise, the maintenance instructor develops classroom teaching skills to prepare the maintenance  learner for practical, hands-on tasks. In both cases, effective communication is necessary to reinforce the skills that have been  attempted and to assess or critique the results. This development continues as an instructor progresses in experience. What worked  early on might be refined or replaced by some other technique as the instructor gains more experience.  

A new instructor is more likely to find a comfortable style of communication in an environment that is not threatening. For a  prospective maintenance instructor, this might take the form of conducting a class on welding while under the supervision of a  maintenance supervisor; the flight instructor applicant usually flies with a  flight instructor   who role plays as the learner.  

Current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) training emphasis has moved from a maneuvers-based training standard to what is  called scenario-based training (SBT). SBT is a highly effective approach that allows learners to understand, then apply their  knowledge as they participate in realistic scenarios. This method of instruction and learning allows learners to move from theory to  practical application of skills during their training. Instructor applicants, flight or maintenance, need to think in terms of SBT while  they are learners. Not only does it prepare them to react appropriately in the situations they encounter in the workplace, it also helps  them as instructors when they are responsible for creating scenarios for their learners.  

For example, James (the flight instructor applicant) designs a scenario in which Ray (the  flight instructor   playing the role of  learner) is performing stalls to Airm a n Certification Standards (ACS). James briefs Ray on the maneuver before the flight,  demonstrates the stall, and then talks Ray through the maneuver. Ray pretends to be an anxious learner pilot, replicating  reactions he himself has experienced with flight learners. After the flight, James critiques their instruction period. As increased  emphasis is placed on SBT, there will be a corresponding increase in the importance of role playing.  

# Instructional Communication  

Instruction has taken place when the instructor explains a particular procedure and subsequently determines that the learner exhibits  the desired response. Even so, the instructor can improve communication by adhering to techniques of good communication.  

One of the basic principles used in public speaking courses is to encourage participants to make presentations about something they  understand. It would not be good if an instructor without a maintenance background tried to teach a course for aviation maintenance.  Instructors perform better when speaking of something they know very well and for which they have a high level of confidence.  

The instructor should not be afraid to use examples of past experiences to illustrate particular points. When teaching the procedures to  be used for transitioning from instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) to visual cues during an approach, it would be helpful to  be   able   to   tell the   learner   about   encountering   these   same   conditions.   An   instructor’s   personal   experiences   make   instruction   more  valuable than reading the same information in a textbook. The instructor should be cautioned, however, to exercise restraint with this  technique of   illustration,   as these types of   discussions   frequently   degrade into   a “war   story” or   “there I   was” discussion.  

The instructor needs some way of determining results, and the method used should be related to the expected outcome. In the case of  flight training, the instructor can judge the actual performance of a maneuver. For a maintenance learner, the instructor can judge the  level of accomplishment of a maintenance procedure. In both cases, the instructor determines whether the learner has actually  received and retained the knowledge or if acceptable performance was a one-time event.  

The aviation learner should know how and why something should be done. For example, a maintenance learner may know how to  tighten a particular fastener to a specified torque, but it is more important to know that the security and integrity of any fastener  depends on proper torque. In this way, the learner would be more likely to torque all fasteners properly in the future. For a flight  learner, simply knowing the different airspeeds for takeoffs and landings is not enough. It is essential to know the reasons for different  airspeeds in specific situations to fully understand the importance of proper airspeed control. Normally, the instructor determines the  level of understanding by use of some type of evaluation. See Chapter 6, Assessment, for more information.  

# Listening  

Instructors should know something about their learners in order to communicate effectively. As discussed earlier, an instructor needs  to determine the abilities of the learners and properly communicate, and one way of becoming better acquainted with learners is to be  a good listener. Good instructors work to master listening ability and frequently self-evaluate in this area. Instructors can use a  number of techniques to become better at listening.     [Figure 4-5]  

![](images/e8b8ea559c0a07a8b7c58fcfeb21c09d03920a42420f3a1de3c06f21c9501c60.jpg)  
Figure 4-5.  Instructors can use a number of tools to become better at listening.  

Just as it is important for instructors to want to listen in order to be effective listeners, it is necessary for learners to want to listen.  Wanting to listen is just one of several techniques that allow a learner to listen effectively. Instructors can improve the percentage of  information transfer by teaching learners how to listen.  [Figure 4-6]  

Listening    more than   hearing.   Most instructors   are familiar   with   the concept that listening    “hearing   with   comprehension.” When   the learner hears something being communicated, he or she may or may not comprehend what is being transmitted. On the other hand,  when the learner truly hears the communication, he or she then interprets the communication based on their knowledge to that point,  processes the information to a level of understanding, and attempts to make a correlation of that communicated information to the  task at hand. The increased level of motivation of typical flight and aviation maintenance learners makes this process much easier.  

Remind learners that certain emotions interfere with how they listen. For example, an instrument learner pilot anticipating drastic  changes in requested routing becomes anxious. In this frame of mind, it is very difficult for the learner to listen and process the new  route. If a learner who is terrified of the prospect of spins attempts to listen to a lesson on spins, the emotions felt might overwhelm  the attempt to listen. This requires a means to allay the anxiety and fear. If the instructor or learner knows that certain areas arouse  emotion, they may consider additional conditioning that prepares the learner to listen.  

![](images/9e226c8188245c7e143643cb5d7db8590fb43c06ddd06562eb18511759047601.jpg)  
Figure 4-6.  Learners can improve their listening skills by applying the steps to effective listening.  

Listening for main ideas is another listening technique. Primarily a technique for listening to a lecture or formal lesson presentation, it  sometimes applies to hands-on situations as well. People who concentrate on remembering or recording facts might very well miss the  message because they have not picked up on the big picture. A listener should always ask, what is the purpose of what I am listening  to? By doing this, the listener can relate the words to the overall concept.  

The instructor should ensure that the learner is aware of the danger of daydreaming. Most people can listen much faster than even the  fastest talker can speak. This leaves room for the mind to get off onto some other subject. The listener who is aware of this problem  can   concentrate on   repeating,   paraphrasing,   or   summarizing   the speaker’s   words.   Doing   so   uses the extra time to   reinforce   the   speaker’s   words,   allowing   the learner    retain   more of   the information.  

Nobody can remember everything. Note taking allows the learner to use an organized system to reconstruct what was said during the  lesson. Every learner has a slightly different system, but no attempt to record the lecture verbatim should be made.  

In   most cases, a shorthand   or   abbreviated   system   of   the learner’s   choosing   should   be encouraged.   Notetaking    merely   a method of  allowing the learner to recreate the lecture so that it can be studied. The same notetaking skills can be used outside the classroom any  time information needs to be retained. For example, copying an instrument clearance word for word is very difficult. By knowing the  format of a typical clearance, learner instrument pilots can develop their own system of abbreviations. This allows them to copy the  clearance in a useful form for read back and for flying the clearance. By incorporating all or some of these techniques, learners retain  more information. Instructors can vastly improve retention of information by making certain their learners have the best possible  listening skills.  

# Questioning  

Good questioning can determine how well the learner understands what is being taught. It also shows the learner that the instructor is  paying   attention   and   that the instructor    interested    the learner’s   response.   An   instructor   should   ask   focused,   open-ended questions  and avoid closed-ended questions .  

Focused questions allow the instructor to concentrate on desired areas. An instructor may ask for additional details, examples, and  impressions from the learner. This allows the instructor to ask further questions if necessary. The presentation can then be modified to  fit the understanding of the learner.  

Open-ended   questions   are designed   to   encourage full, meaningful answers   using   the learner’s   own   knowledge and   perceptions   while  closed-ended questions encourage a short or single-word answer. Open-ended questions, which typically begin with words such as  “why” and   “how” tend   to   be more objective and   less   leading   than   closed-ended questions. Often open-ended questions are not  technically   questions,   but statements   that implicitly   ask   for   completion.   An   instructor’s   ability   to   ask   open-ended questions is an  important skill to develop.  

In contrast, closed-ended   questions   tend   to   evaluate the learner’s   understanding   only   at the rote level of   learning.   Closed-ended  questions   can   be answered   by   “yes” or   “no.” When   used   in   a multiple choice scenario,   closed-ended questions have a finite set of  answers   from   which   the respondent chooses. One of   the choices may   be “other.” It is   a good   idea   to   allow   respondents   to   write   in an  optional response if   they   choose “other” because developing   the learner   response may   lead    insights   into   the learning   process.  

One benefit of closed-ended questions is that they are relatively easy to standardize and the data gathered easily lend themselves to  statistical analysis. The down side to closed-ended questions is that they are more difficult to write than open-ended questions,  generally lead the learner towards the desired answer, and may under certain circumstances direct the conversation toward the  instructor’s   own   agenda.  

To be effective, questions, regardless of the type, are adapted to the ability, experience, and stage of training of the learner. Effective  questions and, therefore, effective communications center on only one idea. A single question should be limited to who, what, when,  where, why, or how and not a combination of these. Effective questioning presents a challenge to the learner. Questions of suitable  difficulty serve to stimulate learning.  

Two ways of confirming that the learner and instructor understand things in the same way are the use of paraphrasing and perception  checking.   The instructor   can   use paraphrasing   to   show   what the learner’s   statement meant to   the instructor.   In   this   way,   the learner  can then make any corrections or expansions on the statement in order to clarify. Perception checking gets to the feelings of the  learner, again by stating what perceptions the instructor has of the behavior that the learner can then clarify as necessary.  

Since it is important that the instructor understand as much as possible about the learners, instructors can be much more effective by  using improved listening skills and effective questions to help in putting themselves in the place of the learners. Questions should be  phrased to focus the learner on the decision-making process and the exercise of good judgment.  

Knowledge of the subject material and skill at instructional communication are necessary to be an instructor. Increasing the depth of  knowledge in either area makes the instructor more effective.  

# Instructional Enhancement  

An instructor never stops learning. While professional development is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8, the more an instructor  knows about a subject, the better the instructor is at conveying that information. For example, a maintenance instructor teaching basic  electricity might be able to teach at a minimally satisfactory level if the instructor had only the same training level as that being  taught. If   asked   a question   that exceeded   the instructor’s   knowledge,   the instructor   could   research   the answer   and   get back   to the  learner. It would be much better if the instructor, through experience or additional training, was prepared to answer the question  initially.   Additional knowledge and   training   would   also   bolster   the instructor’s   confidence   and   give the instructional presentation  more depth. Technically qualified instructors, however, consider the level of the learner and present relevant information to enhance  understanding or to stimulate the interest of the learner.  

# Chapter Summary  

An awareness of the basic elements of the communicative process (source, symbols, and receiver) is the foundation for a successful  communicator. Recognizing the various barriers to communication further enhances the flow of ideas between an instructor and the  learner. Instructors develop communications skills in order to convey desired information to the learners. They also recognize that  communication is a two-way process. In the end, successful communication has taken place if the desired results have been achieved.  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 5: The Teaching Process  

# Introduction  

Bob, an aviation maintenance instructor, arrives thirty minutes before a scheduled class to prepare for the lesson he plans to present  that day. A quick visual scan tells him the classroom has good lighting, the desks are in order, and the room presents a neat overall  appearance. He places his lecture notes on the podium, checking to make sure they are all there and in the correct order. Then, he  turns on the computer to ensure the components are working correctly. A quick run of his visual presentation reassures him this  portion of his lecture is ready. Next, he counts the handouts he plans to distribute to the class. By now, learners are beginning to filter  into the classroom. With his preparations complete, Bob is free to greet the learners, chat with them socially, or answer any questions  they might have about the previous class.  

Today’s   class    Bob’s   introductory   lecture on   aircraft weight and   balance.   Using   a software program,   he has created   a  presentation  featuring examples of safety problems caused by out-of-balance aircraft. He uses these images to introduce the class to the importance  of aircraft weight and balance in safe flying. Then, Bob teaches the class how to compute weight and balance for a generic aircraft.  To reinforce the lecture, Bob divides the class into small groups and distributes handouts which contain sample weight and balance  problems. Working as a group, the learners solve the first weight and balance problem. During this time, Bob and the learners freely  discuss how to figure weight and balance for that particular aircraft. Once the problem is solved, Bob reiterates the steps used to  calculate weight and balance. Now Bob assigns another problem to the learners to be solved independently in class. After each  learner completes this assignment, Bob is confident they will be able to successfully complete the remaining three weight and balance  problems as homework for the next class.  

By using a combination of teaching methods and instructional aids, Bob achieves his instructional objective, which is for the learners  to compute weight and balance. In order to present this lesson, Bob has taken the theoretical information presented in previous  chapters—concepts and principles pertinent to human behavior, how people learn, and effective communication—into the classro om.  He has turned this knowledge into practical methodology for teaching purposes. Drawing on previously discussed theoretical  knowledge, this chapter discusses specific recommendations on how to teach aviation learners.  

# What is Teaching?  

Teaching is to instruct or train. Teachers often complete some type of formal training, have specialized knowledge, have been  certified   or   validated   in   some way,   and   adhere to   a set of   standards   of   performance.   Defining   a “good   instructor” has proven   more  elusive, but in  The Essence of Good Teaching  (1985),   psychologist Stanford   C.   Ericksen   wrote “good   teachers   select and   organize  worthwhile course material, lead learners to encode and integrate this mate rial in memorable form, ensure competence in the  procedures and   methods   of   a discipline,   sustain   intellectual curiosity,   and   promote how    learn   independently.”  

# Process  

The teaching process organizes the material an instructor wishes to teach in such a way that the learner can understand       it. The  teaching process consists of four steps: preparation, presentation, application, and assessment. Regardless of the teaching or training  delivery method used, the overall sequence remains the same. Much research has been devoted to trying to discover what makes an  effective instructor. This research has revealed that effective instructors come in many forms, but they know how to process four  essential teaching steps mentioned above.  [Figure 5-1]  

The remainder of this chapter explores the qualities of effective teachers and the methods used for preparing, presenting applying, and  assessing lesson material and covers  various delivery methods in depth.  

# Essential Teaching Skills  

Four essential skills good teachers have include:  

1. People skills  2. Subject matter expertise  3. Assessment skills  4. Management skills  

# People Skills  

Effective instructors relate well to people. Effective communication, discussed in Chapter 4, underlies people skills. It is important  for instructors to remember:  

⦁  The two-way process of effective communication includes actively listening to the learner.  

![](images/746272446eb7035f1273fab25ca9f04e0c7766fef5ac3d55bf6da1844cc5d6a9.jpg)  
Figure 5-1.  Aviation instructors organize course material and use procedures and methods that promote learning.  

In the previous scenario, Bob uses the guided group discussion period to listen to his learners discuss the weight and balance  problem. By listening to their discussion and questions, he can pinpoint problem areas and explain them more fully during the review  of the solved problem.  

People skills also include the ability to interact respectfully, pick up when learners are not following along, provide motivation, and  adapt to the needs of the learner when necessary. Another important people skill used by effective instructors is to challenge learners  intellectually while supporting their efforts. Effective instructors also display enthusiasm for their subject matter and express  themselves clearly.  

# Subject Matter Expertise  

A subject matter expert (SME) is a person who possesses a high level of expertise, knowledge, or skill in a particular area. For  example, the instructor in the opening scenario is an aviation maintenance SME.  

Effective instructors have a sincere interest in learning and professional growth. There are a number of professional development  opportunities for aviation instructors, such as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) seminars, industry conventions, professional  organizations, and online classes. Networking with and observing other instructors and seeking mentoring from an experienced  instructor to learn new strategies is also helpful. By being a lifelong learner, the aviation professional remains current in both aviation  and education. This topic is explored more thoroughly in the section titled Professional Development found within Chapter 8 of this  handbook: Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism  

# Management Skills  

Management skills generally include the ability to plan, organize, lead, and supervise. For the effective instructor, this translates into  being able to plan, organize, and carry out a lesson. A well-planned lesson means the instructor is also practicing time management  skills and ensures the time allocated for the lesson is used effectively.  

To manage time well, it is important that an instructor plans how to use the time to achieve the lesson goals. This includes time for  what needs to be done as well as time to handle the unexpected. It minimizes stress by not planning too much for the allotted time.  

Time management also come into play for the aviation instructor who is teaching a class. Consider the opening scenario in which Bob  arrived early for the class and ensured the classroom was ready by completing a series of tasks.  

Another management skill that enhances the effectiveness of aviation instructors is supervision of the learners. For the flight  instructor, this may entail overseeing the preflight procedures. For the maintenance instructor, this may mean monitoring a  maintenance procedure. While it is important to provide hands-on tasks in the lesson plan to engage learners, it is also important to  ensure the learners complete the tasks correctly.  

# Assessment Skills  

In Chapter 3, The Learning Process, learning was defined as a change in the behavior as a result of experience. The behavior can be  physical and overt, or it can be intellectual or attitudinal. This change is measurable and therefore can be assessed.  

Assessment of learning is a complex process, and it is important to be clear about the purposes of the assessment. There are several  points at which assessments can be made: before training, during training, and after training. Assessment of learning is another  important skill of an effective instructor.  [Figure 5-2]  This topic is discussed in detail in Chapter 6, Assessment.  

![](images/9fd49fd166604c292691119542e3cab96492743c62f1d59a5d7e50b119372742.jpg)  
Figure 5-2.  An effective instructor uses a variety of tools to evaluate how learners learn, as well as what they know.  

# Instructor's Code of Ethics  

While many of the characteristics of effective instructors discussed in the previous paragraphs hold true for any instructor, the  aviation instructor has the added responsibility of molding an aviation citizen—a pilot or maintenance technician who will be an asset  to the rest of the aviation community. The following code describes the concept of a good aviation citizen.  

An aviation instructor needs to remember he or she is teaching a pilot or technician who should:  

1.   Make safety the number one priority,  2.   Develop and exercise good judgment in making decisions,  3.   Recognize and manage risk effectively,  4.   Be accountable for his or her actions,  5.   Act with responsibility and courtesy,  6.   Adhere to prudent operating practices and personal operating parameters, and  7.   Adhere to applicable laws and regulations.  

In addition, an aviation instructor needs to remember he or she is teaching a pilot who should:  

1. Seek proficiency in control of the aircraft, 2. Use flight deck technology in a safe and appropriate way, 3. Be confident in a wide variety of flight situations, and 4.  Be respectful of the privilege of flight.  

These concepts are also part of the Flight Instructors Model Code of Conduct (FIMCC), designed to enhance flight and ground  instructor safety and professionalism. Developed by a diverse team of aviation professionals and extensively peer-reviewed within the  aviation community, the FIMCC offers a vision of excellence to help flight and ground instructors build professional relationships  with their learners.  

A formal code of conduct/ethics serves as a tool to promote safety, good judgment, ethical behavior, and personal responsibility—all  components of professionalism. The code offers a vision of flight education excellence, and it recommends operating practices to  improve the quality and safety of flight instruction. The FIMCC is one of several similar codes that can be found at  www.secureav.com . such as the Aviator’s Model Code of Conduct and a Student Pilot’s Model Code of Conduct. The National  Association of Flight Instructors (NAFI) and the Society of Aviation and Flight Educators (SAFE), as well as similar groups, also  have a code of ethics for instructors posted on their websites.  

# Course of Training  

In education, a course of training is a complete series of studies leading to attainment of a specific goal. The goal might be a  certificate of completion, graduation, or an academic degree. For example, a learner pilot may enroll in a private pilot certificate  course, and upon completion of all course requirements, be awarded a graduation certificate. A course of training also may be limited  to something like the additional training required for operating high-performance airplanes.  

Other terms closely associated with a course of training include curriculum, syllabus, and lesson plan.  

A curriculum for pilot training usually includes courses for the various pilot certificates and ratings, while the curriculum for an  aviation maintenance technician (AMT) addresses the subject areas described in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) part 147. A syllabus is a summary or outline of an individual course of study that generally contains multiple lessons. The  syllabus   contains   a description   of   each   lesson,   including   objectives and   completion   standards.   In   aviation,   the term   “training   syllabus”  is commonly used and in this context it is a step-by-step, building block progression of learning with provisions for regular review  and assessments at prescribed stages of learning.  [Figure 5-3]     A lesson plan is a detailed plan for how a specific lesson will be  conducted. It includes the lesson objectives, organization of material being covered, description of teaching aids, instruction and  learner actions, and evaluation criteria and completions standards.  

![](images/b171a8f90ace6f0f539e8643486a61efa7dfa963d873a6e3a771aae309bf7483.jpg)  
Figure 5-3.  The syllabus defines the unit of training, states by objective what the learner is expected to accomplish during the unit of  training, shows an organized plan for instruction, and dictates the assessment process for either the unit or stages of learning.  

# Preparation of a Lesson  

A determination of objectives and standards precedes instruction. Although some schools and independent instructors may develop  their own syllabus, in practice, many instructors use a commercially-developed syllabus. For the aviation instructor, the objectives  listed in the syllabus are a beginning point for instruction.  

# Training Objectives and Standards  

Aviation training involves two types of objectives: performance-based and decision-based. Performance-based objectives help define  exactly what needs to be done and how it is done during each lesson. As the learner progresses through higher levels of performance  and understanding, the instructor should shift the training focus to decision-based training objectives. Decision-based training  objectives rely on a more dynamic training environment and are ideally suited to scenario-based training and teach aviation learners  critical thinking skills, such as risk management and aeronautical decision-making (ADM).  

As indicated in Chapter 3, The Learning Process, training objectives apply to all three domains of learning—cognitive (knowledge),  affective (attitudes, beliefs, values), and psychomotor (physical skills). Objectives should incorporate the desired level of learning,  and these level of learning objectives may apply to one or more of the three domains of learning. Since each domain includes several  educational or skill levels, the instructor adapts training objectives to a specific performance level of knowledge or skill. Clearly  defined training objectives that the learner understands are essential to the teaching process regardless of the teaching technique used.  

Standards are closely tied to objectives since they include a description of the desired knowledge, behavior, or skill stated in specific  terms, along with conditions and criteria. When a learner performs according to well-defined standards, evidence of learning is  apparent. Standards should contain comprehensive examples of the desired learning outcomes, or behaviors. As indicated in Chapter  3, The Learning Process, standards for the level of learning in the cognitive and psychomotor domains are easily established.  However,   the design   of   standards   to   evaluate a learner’s   level of   understanding   or   overt behavior   in   the affective domain   (attitudes,  beliefs, and values) is more difficult.  

The overall objective of an aviation training course is usually well established, and the general standards are included in various rules  and related publications. For example, eligibility, knowledge, proficiency, and experience requirements for pilots and AMT learners  are stipulated in the regulations, and the standards are published in the applicable Airman Certification Standards (ACS)/Practical  Test Standards (PTS) or oral and practical tests (O&Ps). It should be noted that ACS/PTS and O&P standards are limited to the most  critical job tasks. Certification tests do not represent an entire training syllabus.  

A broad, overall objective of any pilot training course is to qualify the learner to be a competent, efficient, safe pilot for the operation  of specific aircraft types under stated conditions. Similar objectives and standards are established for AMT learners. While the  established criteria or standards to determine whether the training has been adequate use the 14 CFR certification requirements,  professional instructors should not limit their objectives to meeting the minimum published requirements for pilot or AMT  certification.  

Successful instructors teach their learners not only how, but also why and when. By incorporating ADM and risk management into  each lesson, the aviation instructor helps the learner understand, develop, and reinforce the decision-making process which ultimately  leads to sound judgment and good  decision-making skills.  

# Performance-Based Objectives  

Performance-based objectives set measurable, reasonable standards describing the learner's desired performance, and may be referred  to as a behavioral, performance, instructional, or educational objective. All refer to the same thing, the behavior of the learner.  

These objectives provide a way of stating the level of performance a learner needs to demonstrate before he or she progresses to the  next stage of instruction. Again, the objectives should be clear, measurable, and repeatable and mean the same thing to any  knowledgeable reader. The objectives should be written to avoid the fallibility of recall, interpretation, or loss of specificity with time.  

Performance-based objectives consist of three elements: description of the skill or behavior, the conditions, and the criteria. Each  part should be stated in a way that leaves every reader with the same picture of the objective, how it is performed, and at the level of  performance.  [Figure 5-4]  

# Description of the Skill or Behavior  

The description of the skill or behavior explains the desired outcome of the instruction as a change in knowledge, skill, or attitude.  The skill or   behavior   should   be in   concrete and   measurable terms.   Phrases   such   as “knowledge of   ...” and   “awareness   of   ...” cannot be  measured   very   well and   should   be avoided.   Phrases   like “able to   select from   a list of   ...” or   “able to   repeat the steps   to   ...” are better because they describe something measurable.  

![](images/faf5b64e705a8bc1c3e00d450ec74bc8168a9519612a7d10226a1dff3ee315b9.jpg)  
Figure 5-4.  Performance-based objectives are made up of a description of the skill or behavior, conditions, and criteria.  

# Conditions  

Conditions explain the rules for demonstration of the skill. If the desired objective is to navigate from point A to point B, the  objective, as stated, is not specific enough for all learners to do it in the same way. Information such as equipment, tools, reference  material, and limiting parameters should be included. For example, inserting several conditions narrows the objective as follows:  “Using   appropriate charts,   a prepared   flight log,   and   training   aircraft, navigate from   point A   to   point B   while maintaining   standard  hemispheric altitudes.”   Sometimes, in   the process   of   reading   the objective,   someone might say,   “But, what if   ...?” This    a good  indication that the conditions are confusing and need clarification.  

# Criteria  

Criteria are the standards that measure the accomplishment of the objective. Good criteria define performance so there can be no  question whether or not the performance meets the objective. In the previous example, the criteria may include that navigation from  point A to point B be accomplished within 5 minutes of the preplanned flight time and that en route altitude be maintained within 200  feet. The revised performance-based objective may now also include arrival at point B within 5 minutes of planned arrival time and  cruise altitude should   be maintained   within   200   feet during   the en   route phase of   the flight.”   The alert reader   has already   noted that  the conditions and criteria changed slightly during the development of these objectives. In real-world objective development, that is  exactly the way it will occur. Conditions and criteria may be refined as necessary.  

# The Importance of the ACS in Aviation Training Curricula  

ACS documents hold an important position in aviation training curricula because they supply the instructor with specific performance  objectives based on the standards for the issuance of a particular aviation certificate or rating.  [Figure   $_{5-5J}$    The FAA frequently  reviews the ACS test Areas of Operation and Tasks to maintain their relevance to the current aviation environment. Test items  included as part of a test or evaluation should be both content valid and criterion valid. Content validity means that a particular  maneuver or procedure closely mimics what is required in actual flying. Criterion validity means that the completion standards for the  test are reflective of acceptable standards.  

For example, in flight training, content validity is reflected by a particular maneuver closely mimicking a maneuver required in actual  flight, such as the learner pilot being able to recover from a power-off stall. Criterion validity means that the completion standards for  the test are reflective of acceptable standards in actual flight. Thus, the learner pilot exhibits knowledge of all the elements involved  in a power-off stall as listed in the ACS.

Figure 5-5.  Examples of Airman Certification Standards.  

As discussed in Chapter 3, The Learning Process, humans develop cognitive skills through active interaction with the world. This  concept has led to the adoption of scenario-based training in many fields, including aviation. An effective aviation instructor uses the  maneuver-based approach of the ACS but presents the objectives in a scenario situation.  

It has been found that flight learners using SBT methods demonstrate flying skills equal to or better than those trained under the  maneuver-based approach only. Of even more significance is that the same data also suggest that SBT learners demonstrate better  decision-making skills than maneuver-based learners—most likely because their training occurred while performing realistic flight  maneuvers and not artificial maneuvers designed only for teaching that maneuver.  

The incorporation of SBT as part of the lesson is discussed in more detail later in this chapter, as well as in Chapter 7, Planning  Instructional Activity.  

# Decision-Based Objectives  

The design and use of decision-based objectives specifically develops pilot judgment and ADM skills. Improper pilot decisions cause  a significant percentage of all accidents, and the majority of fatal accidents in aircraft. Decision-based objectives facilitate a higher  level of learning and application. By using dynamic and meaningful scenarios, the instructor teaches    the learner how to  gather information and make informed, safe, and timely decisions.  

Decision-based training is not a new concept. Experienced instructors have been using scenarios that require dynamic problem  solving to teach cross-country operations, emergency procedures, and other flight skills for years.  

Decision-based learning objectives and the use of flight training scenarios do not preclude traditional maneuver-based training.  Rather, flight maneuvers are integrated into the flight training scenarios and conducted as they would occur in the real-world. Those  maneuvers requiring repetition may still be taught during concentrated settings. However, once they are learned, they are integrated  into realistic and dynamic flight situations.  

Decision-based objectives are also important for the aviation instructor planning AMT training. An AMT uses ADM and risk  management skills during the repair and maintenance of aircraft.  

# Other Uses of Training Objectives  

Performance-based and decision-based objectives help an instructor design a complete lesson plan. An instructor can use the  standards of assessment, objectives, conditions, and criteria to fashion many of the details on the lesson plan. For example, many of  the objective components may be used to determine the elements of the lesson and the schedule of events. The equipment necessary  and the instructor and learner actions anticipated during the lesson have also been specified. By listing the criteria for the training  objectives, the instructor has already established the completion standards normally included as part of the lesson plan.  

Use of training objectives also provides the learner with a better understanding of the big picture, as well as knowledge of what is  expected. This overview can alleviate a significant source of uncertainty and frustration on the part of the learner.  

# Presentation of a Lesson  

How does an instructor keep the attention of a class? The steps in  Figure 5-6  form a guideline for lesson presentation. Many of them  can be combined during the actual presentation. For example, consider a video presentation given during the weight and balance  lecture. The video adds a multimedia element to the lecture, is a good attention getter, and can visually demonstrate the learning  objective.

# Organization of Material  

After determining objectives and standards, an instructor formulates a plan of action to lead learners through the course in a logical  manner toward the desired goal. Usually, the goal for learners is a certificate or rating. It could be a private pilot certificate, an  instrument rating, an AMT certificate or, other rating. In all cases, a systematic plan of action requires the use of an appropriate  training syllabus. Generally, the syllabus contains a description of each lesson, including objectives and completion standards.  

The main concern of the instructor is usually organizing a block of training with integrated lesson plans. The traditional organization  of a lesson plan is introduction, development, and conclusion.  

# Lesson Introduction  

The introduction sets the stage for everything to come. Efforts in this area pay great dividends in terms of quality of instruction. In  brief, the introduction is made up of three elements: attention, motivation, and an overview.  

# Attention  

The purpose of   the attention   element is   to   focus   each   learner’s   attention   on   the lesson.   The instructor   begins   by   telling   a story,  showing a video clip, asking a question, or telling a joke. Any of these may be appropriate at one time or another. Regardless of  which is used, it should relate to the subject and establish a background for developing the learning outcomes. Telling a story or a  joke unrelated   in   some way   to   the subject distracts   from   the lesson.   The main   concern    to   focus   everyone’s   attention   on   the   subject.  [Figure 5-7]  

![](images/908dd23b7cefc64b3f2c2c4633c85748eaf7c5f3d5b831caa014ab97acf1fd67.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.  The attention element causes learners to focus on the upcoming lesson.  

# Motivation  

The motivation element offers the learners specific reasons why the lesson content is important to know, understand, apply, or  perform   and   thus   ensures readiness   (Thorndike’s   Law   of   Readiness).   The instructor   may   provide examples where someone applied   the knowledge or remind the learners of an upcoming assessment. The motivation should appeal to each learner personally and  engender a desire to understand the material.  

# Overview  

Every lesson introduction should contain an overview that tells the group what is to be covered during the period. A clear, concise  presentation of the objective and the key ideas gives the learners a road map of the route to be followed. A good visual aid can help  the instructor show the learners the path that they are to travel.  

# Development  

Development is the main part of the lesson. Here, the instructor develops the subject matter in a manner that helps the learners  achieve the desired outcomes. The instructor organizes the material logically to show the relationships of the main points. The  instructor may show these primary relationships by developing the main points in one of the following ways: from past to present,  simple to complex, known to unknown, and most frequently used to least used.  

# Past to Present  

In this pattern of development, the subject matter is arranged chronologically, from the present to the past or from the past to the  present. Time relationships are most suitable when history is an important consideration, as in tracing the development of radio  navigation systems.  

# Simple-to-Complex  

The simple-to-complex pattern helps the instructor lead the learner from simple facts or ideas to an understanding of the phenomena  or concepts involved. When beginning a study of jet propulsion the learner might start by considering the forces involved when  releasing air from a toy balloon and finish by taking part in a discussion of a complex gas turbine engine.  

Do not be afraid to omit less important information at first in order to simplify the learning process. If Class D, E, and G airspace are  the only airspace types being utilized by a learner, save the discussion of A, B, and C airspace until they have operating familiarity  with the other types. Less information at first is easier to absorb.  

# Known to Unknown  

By using something the learner already knows as the point of departure, the instructor can lead into new ideas and concepts. For  example, when developing a lesson on heading indicators, the instructor could begin with a discussion of the magnetic compass  before proceeding to a description of gyroscopic indicators.  

# Most Frequently Used to Least Used  

In some subjects, certain information or concepts are common to all who use the material. This fourth organizational pattern starts  with common usage before progressing to the rarer ones. Even though some aircraft are equipped with a computerized navigational  system, instructors should begin by teaching learners the basics of navigation since all pilots use the basic skills.  

Under each main point in a lesson, the subordinate points should lead naturally from one to another. With this arrangement, each  point leads logically to and serves as a reminder of the next. Meaningful transition from one main point to another keeps the learners  oriented, aware of where they have been, and where they are going. This permits learners to sort or categorize information in their  working or short-term memory and allows them to process and remember what they have been taught.  

# Conclusion  

An effective conclusion retraces the important elements of the lesson and relates them to the objective. This review and wrap-up of  ideas reinforces learning and improves retention. New ideas should not be introduced in the conclusion because they are likely to  confuse the learners  

By organizing the lesson material into a logical format, the instructor maximizes the opportunity for learners to retain the desired  information. Since each teaching situation is unique, the setting and purpose of the lesson determines which teaching method is used.  

# Training Delivery Methods  

Today’s   instructor   can   choose from   a wealth   of   ways    present instructional material: lecture,   discussion,   guided   discussion, problem  based, group learning, demonstration-performance, or e-learning. In a typical lesson, an effective instructor normally uses a  combination of methods. The instructor determines which teaching method best conveys the information and when to use it. For  example, Bob lectures in the opening scenario, but after teaching how to compute weight and balance, he uses group learning to  reinforce the lecture.  

# Lecture Method  

In the lecture method, the instructor delivers knowledge via lectures to learners who are more or less silent participants. Lectures are  best used when an instructor wishes to convey a general understanding of a subject. In  general, lectures begin with an introduction of  the topic to   be discussed.   The body   of   the lecture follows   with   a summary   of   the lecture’s   main   points   at the end.  

Lectures may introduce new subjects, summarize ideas, show relationships between theory and practice, and reemphasize main  points. Thus, the lecture method is adaptable to many different settings, including small or large groups. Finally, lectures may be  combined with other teaching methods to give added meaning and direction.  

There are different varieties of lectures. During the illustrated talk, the speaker relies heavily on visual aids to convey ideas to the  listeners. When using a briefing, the speaker presents a concise array of facts to the listeners who normally do not expect elaboration  of   supporting   material.   During   a formal lecture,   the speaker’s   purpose is   to   inform,    persuade,   or    entertain   with   little   or no verbal  participation by the learners. When using a teaching lecture, the instructor plans and delivers an oral presentation in a manner that  allows some participation by the learners and helps direct them toward the desired learning outcomes.  

# Teaching Lecture  

The teaching lecture is favored by aviation instructors because it allows some active participation by the learners. In other methods of  teaching such as demonstration-performance or guided discussion, the instructor receives direct reaction from the learners, either  verbally or by some form of body language. However in the teaching lecture, the feedback is not nearly as obvious and is much  harder to interpret. An effective instructor develops a keen perception for subtle responses from the class—facial expressions, manner  of taking notes, and apparent interest or disinterest in the lesson. The effective instructor is able to interpret the meaning of these  reactions and adjust the lesson accordingly.  

# Preparing the Teaching Lecture  

The following four steps should be followed in the planning phase of preparation:  

1. Establishing the objective and desired outcomes  2. Researching the subject  3. Organizing the material  4. Planning productive classroom activities  

While developing the lesson, the instructor also should strongly consider the use of examples and personal experiences related to the  subject of the lesson. The instructor may support any point with meaningful examples, comparisons, statistics, or testimony.  

After completing the preliminary planning and writing of the lesson plan, the instructor should rehearse the lecture to build self- confidence. Rehearsals, or dry runs, help smooth out the mechanics of using notes, visual aids, and other instructional devices. If  possible, the instructor should have another knowledgeable person or another instructor observe the practice sessions and act as a  critic. This critique helps the instructor judge the adequacy of supporting materials and visual aids, as well as the overall presentation.  [Figure 5-8]  

![](images/42719023d1ed517f981cab044c99ca93671dd42c1d7e5d43a86eeaf58d86ab38.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.  Instructors should try a dry run with another instructor to get a feel for the lecture presentation.  

# Suitable Language  

In the teaching lecture, simple rather than complex words should be used whenever possible. The instructor should not, use  substandard English or errors in grammar.  

If the subject matter includes technical terms, the instructor should clearly define each one so that no learner is in doubt about its  meaning.   Whenever   possible,   the instructor   should   use specific rather   than   general words.   For   example,   the specific words,   “a   leak in  the fuel line”   tell more than   the general term   “discrepancy.”  

Another way the instructor can add life to the lecture is to vary his or her tone of voice and pace of speaking. In addition, using  sentences of different length helps, since consistent use of short sentences results in a choppy style. On the other hand, poorly  constructed long sentences are difficult to follow and can easily become tangled. To ensure clarity and variety, the instructor should  normally use sentences of short and medium length.  

# Types of Delivery  

A good teaching lecture utilizes an extemporaneous technique. The instructor speaks from a mental or written outline, but does not  read or memorize the material to be presented. Because the exact words to express an idea are spontaneous, the lecture is more  personalized than one that is read or spoken from memory.  

If the instructor realizes from puzzled expressions that a number of learners fail to grasp an idea, that point can be further elaborated  until the reactions   indicate   they   understand.   The extemporaneous   presentation   reflects the instructor’s   personal enthusiasm   and is  more flexible than other methods. For these reasons, it is likely to hold the interest of the learners.  

Notes used wisely can ensure accuracy, jog the memory, and dispel the fear of forgetting. They are essential for      reporting  complicated information, and they may help keep the lecture on track. The instructor who requires notes should use them sparingly  and unobtrusively but at the same time should make no effort to hide them from the learners.  [Figure 5-9]  

![](images/bf3638a558d0efb368f0deab531ad0c2c5c714ab2da56fdc651ed402f0ea2fee.jpg)  
Figure 5-9.  Notes allow the accurate dissemination of complicated information.  

An informal lecture includes active learner participation. Learning is best achieved if learners participate actively in a friendly,  relaxed atmosphere. The use of questions achieves active learner participation. In this way, the learners are encouraged to make  contributions   that   supplement   the   lecture.   However,   it is   the   instructor’s   responsibility   to   plan,   organize,   develop,   and   present the  major portion of a lesson.  

# Advantages and Disadvantages of the Lecture  

A lecture is a convenient way to instruct large groups. If necessary, a public address system can be used to amplify the speaker’s   voice. Lectures can be used to present information that would be difficult for the learners to get in other ways, particularly if they do  not have the time required for research, or if they do not have access to reference material. Lectures supplement other teaching  devices and methods. A brief introductory lecture can give direction and purpose to a demonstration or prepare learners for a  discussion by telling them something about the subject matter to be covered.  

In a lecture, the instructor can present many ideas in a relatively short time. Logically organized ta sks   and ideas can be presented  concisely and in rapid sequence.  

The lecture is particularly suitable for explaining any necessary background information. By using a lecture in this way, the instructor  can offer learners with varied backgrounds a common understanding of essential principles and facts. However, lectures do not allow  an instructor a precise measure of learner understanding of the material covered.  

To achieve desired learning outcomes through the lecture method, an instructor needs considerable skill in speaking. As indicated in  Chapter   3,   The   Learning   Process,   a learner’s   rate   of   retention   drops   off   significantly   after   the   first   10-15 minutes of a lecture and  improves at the end. Research has shown that learning is an active process—the more involved learners are in the process, the more  they retain.  

The lecture does not foster attainment of certain types of learning outcomes, such as motor skills, which need to be perfected via  hands-on practice. Thus, an instructor who introduces some form of active learner participation in the middle of a lecture greatly  increases retention.  

# Discussion Method  

The discussion method modifies the pure lecture form by using lecture and then discussion to actively integrate the learner into the  process. In the discussion method, the instructor provides a short lecture, which gives basic knowledge to the learners. This short  lecture is followed by instructor-learner and learner- learner discussion.  

This method relies on discussion and the exchange of ideas. Everyone has the opportunity to comment, listen, think, and participate.  By being actively engaged in discussing the lecture, learners improve their recall and ability to use the information.  

It is important for the instructor to keep the discussion focused on the subject matter. The instructor may need to initiate leading  questions, comment on any disagreements, ensure that all learners participate, and summarize what has been learned.  

Tying the discussion method into the lecture method not only provides active participation, it also allows learners to develop higher  order thinking skills (HOTS). The give and take of the discussion method also helps learners evaluate ideas, concepts, and principles.  When using this method, instructors should keep their own discussion to a minimum since the goal is learner participation.  

# Guided Discussion Method  

Instructors can also use another form of discussion, the guided discussion method, to ensure the learner has correctly received and  interpreted subject information. The learner needs a level of knowledge about the topic to be discussed, either through reading prior  to class or a short lecture to set up the topic to be discussed. This training method employs instructor-guided discussion with the  instructor maintains control of the discussion. It can be used during classroom periods and preflight and postflight briefings. The  discussions reflect whatever level of knowledge and experience the learners have gained.  

The goal of guided discussions is to draw out the knowledge of the learner. The greater the participation becomes, the more effective  the learning will be. All members of the group should follow the discussion. The instructor should treat everyone impartially,  encourage questions, exercise patience and tact, and comment on all responses with the goal of reinforcing a learning objective  related to the lesson. The instructor acts as a facilitator to encourage discussion between learners without sarcasm.  

# Use of Questions in a Guided Discussion  

In the guided discussion, learning is achieved through the skillful use of questions. Questions can be categorized by function and  characteristics.  

The instructor often uses a lead-off question to open up an area for discussion. After the discussion develops, the instructor may ask a  follow-up question to guide the discussion. The reasons for using a follow-up question may vary. The instructor may want a learner to  explain something more thoroughly, or may need to bring the discussion back to a point from which it has strayed. An instructor may  answer a question with a question and direct that question back to the person posing the question or other participant.  

Questions are so much a part of teaching that they are often taken for granted. Effective use of questions may result in more learning  than any other single technique used by instructors. Instructors should avoid questions that can be answered by short factual  statements or yes or no responses and ask open-ended questions that are thought provoking and require more mental activity. Since  most aviation training is at the understanding level or higher, questions should require learners to grasp concepts, explain similarities  and differences, and to infer cause-and-effect relationships.  [Figure 5-10]  

![](images/a45f39e0a8907cfd2e5f81f02235c17079176687e0080f70d8bbb1e59ae3bfa5.jpg)  
Figure 5-10.  If the objectives of a lesson are clearly established in advance, instructors will find it much easier to ask appropriate  questions that keep the discussion moving in the planned direction.  

# Planning a Guided Discussion  

Planning a guided discussion is similar to planning a lecture. (Note that the following suggestions include many that are appropriate  for planning cooperative learning, to be discussed later in the chapter.)  

⦁  Select an appropriate topic. Unless the learners have some knowledge to exchange with each other, they      cannot reach the desired learning outcomes. If necessary, make assignments that give the learners an      adequate background for discussing the lesson topic.  

⦁  State the specific lesson objective at the understanding level of learning. Through discussion, the learners      develop an understanding of the subject by sharing knowledge, experiences, and backgrounds. The desired      learning outcomes should stem from the objective.  ⦁  Conduct adequate research to become familiar with the topic. The instructor should always be alert for      ideas that will enhance a lesson for a particular group of learners. Similarly, the instructor can consider      any prediscussion assignment while conducting research for the classroom period. During this research      process, the instructor should also earmark reading material that appears to be appropriate as background      material for learners. Such material should be well organized and based on fundamentals.  ⦁  Organize the main and subordinate points of the lesson in a logical sequence. The guided discussion has  three main parts: introduction, discussion, and conclusion. The introduction consists of three elements:  attention, motivation, and overview. During the discussion, the instructor should be certain that the main  points discussed build logically with the objective. The conclusion consists of the summary of the main  points. By organizing in this manner, the instructor phrases the questions to help the learners obtain a firm  grasp of the subject matter and to minimize the possibility of a rambling discussion.  

⦁  Plan at least one lead-off question for each desired learning outcome. While preparing questions, the  instructor should remember that the purpose is to stimulate discussion, not merely to get answers. Lead-off  questions   should   usually   begin   with   how   or   why.   For   example,   it is   better    ask   “Why   does an   aircraft  normally   require a longer   takeoff   run   at Denver   than   at New   Orleans?” instead   of   “Would   you   expect an   aircraft to   require a longer   takeoff   run   at Denver   or   at New   Orleans?” Learners   can   answer   the second   question   by   merely   saying   “Denver,” but the first question    likely    start a   discussion   of   air   density,   engine efficiency, and the effect of temperature on performance.  

# Learner Preparation for a Guided Discussion  

It is   the instructor’s   responsibility    help   learners   prepare themselves for   the discussion.   Each   learner   should   be encouraged to accept  responsibility for contributing to the discussion and benefiting from it. Throughout the time the instructor prepares the learners for  their discussion, they should be made aware of the lesson objective(s). In certain instances, the instructor has no opportunity to assign  preliminary work. In such cases, it is practical and advisable to give the learners a brief general survey of the topic during the  introduction. Normally, learners should not be asked to discuss a subject without some background in that subject.  

# Guiding a Discussion—Instructor Technique  

The techniques used to guide a discussion require practice and experience. The instructor needs to keep up with the discussion and  know   when   to   intervene with   questions   or   redirect the group’s   focus.   The following   information   provides a framework   for   successfully conducting the guided discussion.  

# Introduction  

The introduction should include an attention element, a motivation element, and an overview of key points. To encourage enthusiasm  and stimulate discussion, the instructor should create a relaxed, informal atmosphere. Each learner should be given the opportunity to  discuss the various aspects of the subject, and feel free to do so. Moreover, the learner should feel a personal responsibility to  contribute. The instructor should try to make the learners feel that their ideas and active participation are wanted and needed.  

# Discussion  

The instructor opens the discussion by asking one of the prepared lead-off questions. Discussion questions should be easy for  learners to understand and put forth decisively. While the instructor should have the answer in mind before asking the question, the  learners need to think about the question before answering. It takes time for learners to recall data, determine how to answer, or to  think of an example.  

The more difficult the question, the more time the learners need to answer. If the instructor sees puzzled expressions, denoting that  the learners do not understand the question, it should be rephrased in a slightly different form. The nature of the questions should be  determined by the lesson objective and desired learning outcomes.  

Once the discussion is underway, the instructor should listen attentively to the ideas, experiences, and examples contributed by the  learners during the discussion. Remember that during the preparation, the instructor listed some of the anticipated responses that  would,    discussed   by   the learners,   indicate   that they   had   a firm   grasp   of   the subject. By   using   “how” and   “why” follow- up questions,  the instructor should be able to guide the discussion toward the objective of helping learners understand the subject.  

After the learners discuss the ideas that support this particular part of the lesson, the instructor should summarize what they have  accomplished using an interim summary. This usually occurs after the discussion of each learning outcome to bring ideas together and  help in transition, showing how the discussion by the group related to and supported the objective. An interim summary reinforces  learning in relation to a specific learning outcome. The interim summary may also be used to keep the group on the subject or to  divert the discussion to another member.  

# Conclusion  

A guided discussion closes by summarizing the material covered. The instructor ties together the various points or topics discussed,  and shows the relationships between the facts brought forth and the practical application of these facts. For example, while  concluding a discussion on density altitude, an instructor might describe an accident, which occurred due to a pilot attempting to take  off at a high-altitude airport with a fully loaded aircraft on a hot day.  

The summary should be succinct, but not incomplete. If the discussion has revealed that certain areas are not understood by one or  more members of the group, the instructor should clarify or cover this material again.  

# Advantages  

Training methods involving discussion encourage learners to listen to and learn from their instructor and each other. Open-ended  questions   during   guided   discussion   leads   to   concepts   of   risk   management and   ADM.   The use of   “What If?” during   the discussion   calls for high order thinking skills and exposes the learner to the decision-making process.  

From the description of guided discussion, it is obvious this method works well in a group situation, but it can be modified for an  interactive one-on-one learning situation.  [Figure 5-11]  

![](images/532c2607748d8f569915c7374b7f0c3b019bcaa5585b91c92ab0094828afbc15.jpg)  
Figure 5-11.  As the learner grows in flight knowledge, he or she should be able to lead the postflight review while the instructor  guides the discussion with targeted questions.  

# Problem-Based Learning  

In 1966, the McMaster University School of Medicine in Canada pioneered a new approach to teaching and curriculum design called  problem-based learning (PBL). In the intervening years, PBL has helped shift the focus of learning from an instructor-centered  approach to a learner-centered approach. There are many definitions for PBL, but this handbook defines it as a learning environment  where lessons involve learners with problems encountered in real life and that ask them to find real-world solutions.  

PBL starts with a carefully constructed problem to which there is no single solution. The benefit of PBL lies in helping the learner  gain a deeper understanding of the information and in improving his or her ability to recall the information.  

When   presenting   material as an   authentic problem   in   a situated   environment, the learner   may   “make meaning” of    the information  based on past experience and personal interpretation. This problem type encourages the development of HOTS, which include  cognitive processes such as problem solving and decision-making, as well as the cognitive skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation.  

Developing good problems that motivate, focus, and initiate learning are an important component of PBL. Effective problems:  

1. Relate to the real-world so learners want to solve them.  2. Require learners to make decisions.  3. Are open-ended and not limited to one correct answer.  4. Are connected to previously learned knowledge as well as new knowledge.  5. Reflect lesson objective(s).  6. Challenge learners to think critically.  

# Teaching Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)  

To teach the cognitive skills needed in making decisions and judgments effectively, an instructor should incorporate analysis,  synthesis, and evaluation into lessons using PBL. HOTS should be taught throughout the curriculum from simple to complex and  from concrete to abstract.  

Basic approach to teaching HOTS:  

1.   Set up the problem.  2.   Determine learning outcomes for the problem.  3.   Solve the problem or task.  4.   Reflect on problem-solving process.  5.   Consider additional solutions through guided discovery.  6.   Reevaluate solution with additional options.  7.   Reflect on this solution and why it could be the best solution.  8.   Consider what “best” means (Is it situational?).  

# Types of Problem-Based Instruction  

A problem-based lesson usually involves an incentive or need to solve the problem. It includes a decision on how to find a solution, a  possible solution, an explanation for the reasons used to reach that solution, and then reflection on the solution. A discussion of three  types of problem-based instruction follow: scenario-based, collaborative problem-solving, and case study.  

# Scenario-Based Training Method (SBT)  

SBT uses a highly structured script of real-world experiences to address aviation training objectives in an operational environment. It  presents realistic situations that allow learners to rehearse mentally and explore practical application of various bits of knowledge.  Pilot decisions cause a significant percentage of all accidents and the majority of fatal accidents, and SBT challenges the learner or  transitioning pilot using a variety of flight scenarios with the goal of avoiding accidents. These scenarios require the pilot to manage  the available resources, exercise sound judgment, and make timely decisions. Such training can include initial training, transition  training, upgrade training, recurrent training, and special training. Since it has been documented that learners gain more knowledge  when actively involved in the learning process, SBT is also used to train AMTs.  

The scenario may not have one right or one wrong answer, which reflects situations faced in the real-world. It is important for the  instructor to understand in advance which outcomes are positive and/or negative and give the learner freedom to make both good and  poor decisions without jeopardizing safety. This allows the learner to make decisions that fit his or her experience level and result in  positive outcomes.  

Once the class has mastered the ability to compute weight and balance, Bob decides to give them a real-world scenario. A customer  wants a tail strobe light installed on his Piper Cherokee 180. How will this installation affect the weight and balance of the aircraft?  

The learners need to plan to remove the position light, install a power supply, and also install the tail strobe light. Then they need to  consider all the actions and procedures that affect the final weight and balance of the aircraft. What if part of the assembly does not fit  properly? The real-world problem forces the learner to analyze, evaluate, and make decisions about the procedures required.  

For   the flight instructor,   a good   scenario   tells   a story   that begins   with   a reason   to   fly   because a pilot’s   decisions   differ   depending on  the motivation to fly. For example, Mark and his college fraternity brothers bought tickets for a playoff game at their alma mater.  Mark volunteered to fly all of them to the game in an airplane he rented. Another friend is planning to meet them at the airport and  drive everyone to the game and back.  

Mark has strong motivation to fly his friends to the game, so he checks the weather for College Airport which is reported as clear and  unrestricted visibility. His flight is a go, yet, 15 miles from College Airport he descends to 1,000 feet to stay below the lowering  clouds and encounters rain and lowering visibility to 3 miles. The terrain is flat farmland with no published obstacles. What will he do  now?  

Remember, a good inflight scenario is a learning experience. SBT is a powerful tool because the future is unpredictable and there is  no way to train a pilot for every combination of events that may happen in the future. A good scenario:  

1.   Is not a test;  2.   Will not have one right answer;  3.   Does not offer an obvious answer;  4.   Should not promote errors; and  5.   Should promote situational awareness and opportunities for decision-making.  

# Collaborative Problem-Solving Method  

When using the collaborative problem-solving method, the instructor provides a problem to a group who then solves it. The instructor  provides assistance when needed, but understands that learning to solve the problem without assistance is part of the learning process.  This method can be modified for an interactive one-on-one learning situation such as an independent aviation instructor might  encounter. The instructor provides the problem to the learner and participates in finding solutions by offering limited assistance as the  learner solves it. Once again, open-ended   “what if” problems   encourage the learners   an   opportunity    develop   HOTS.  

# Case Study Method  

An increasingly popular form of teaching, the case study, contains a story relative to the learner that forces him or her to deal with  situations encountered in real life. The instructor presents the case to the learners who then analyze it, come to conclusions, and offer  possible solutions. Effective case studies require the learner to use critical thinking skills.  

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) descriptions of aviation accidents provide an excellent source of real-world case  studies for flight instructors. By removing the NTSB determination of probable cause, a flight instructor can use the description as a  case study and allow the learners to discuss probable cause without bias. The learners analyze the information and suggest possible  reasons   for   the accident. The instructor   then   shares the NTSB’s   determination   of   probable cause,   which   can   lead   to   further   discussions of how to avoid this type of accident.  

# Electronic Learning (E-Learning)  

Electronic learning or e-learning has become an umbrella term for any type of education that involves an electronic component.  [Figure 5-12]  E-learning comes in many formats. It can be a stand-alone software program that takes a learner from lecture to exam  or it can be an interactive web-based course.  

Time flexible, cost competitive, learner-centered, easily updated, accessible anytime and anywhere; e-learning has many advantages  that make it a popular addition to the field of education.  

E-learning is now used for training at many different levels. For example, technology flight training devices and flight simulators are  used by everyone from flight schools to major airlines, as well as the military. Flight Schools of all types may offer training using a  variety of computer-based desk top Basic Aviation Training Devices (BATDs), stand-alone, personal computer based advanced  aviation training devices (AATDs) and even more advance Flight Training Devices (FTDs) for a portion of the time a pilot needs for  various certificates and ratings. Major airlines have high-level flight simulators that are so realistic that transitioning crews meet all  qualifications in the flight simulator. Likewise, military pilots use flight training devices or flight simulators to prepare for flying  aircraft, such as the A-10, for which there are no two-seat training versions. With e-learning, sophisticated databases can organize  vast amounts of information that can be quickly sorted, searched, found, and cross-indexed.  

![](images/9b694761f2b70181b707aba3fe41b4f834388fe362ccc4bef281c91b6e1f7927.jpg)  
Figure 5-12.  E-learning encompasses a variety of electronic educational media.  

The active nature of e-learning enhances the overall learning process several ways. Well-designed programs allow learners to feel  more in control of the content and how fast they learn it. They can explore areas of interest and discover more about a subject on their  own. In addition, e-learning often seems more enjoyable than learning from a classroom lecture. Main advantages include less time  spent on instruction compared to traditional classroom training, and a higher level of mastery and retention.  

Distance learning, or the use of electronic media to deliver instruction when the instructor and learner are separated, is another  advantage to e-learning. Participants in a class may be located on different continents, yet share the same teaching experience.  Distance learning also may be defined as a system and process that connects learners with resources for learning. As sources for  access to information expand, the possibilities for distance learning increase.  

While e-learning has many training advantages, it also has limitations which can include the lack of peer interaction and personal  feedback, depending on what method of e-learning is used. For the instructor, maintaining control of the learning situation may be  difficult. It also may be difficult to find good programs for certain subject areas, and the expense associated with the equipment,  software, and facilities need to be considered. In addition, instructors and learners may lack sufficient experience with specific  programs to take full advantage of the software that is available.  

Improper or excessive use of e-learning should be avoided. For example, a flight instructor should not rely exclusively on a software  program on traffic patterns and landings to do the ground instruction for a learner pilot, and then expect the learner to demonstrate  patterns and landings in the aircraft. Likewise, it would be unfair to expect a maintenance learner to safely and properly perform a  compression check on an aircraft engine if he or she received only e-learning training.  

Along with the many types of e-learning, there are a variety of terms used to describe the educational use of the computer. This  handbook   will use the term   “computer-assisted   learning” in   the following   discussion.  

# Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL) Method  

Computer-assisted learning (CAL) couples the personal computer (PC) with multimedia software to create a training device. For  example, major aircraft manufacturers have developed CAL programs to teach aircraft systems and maintenance procedures to their  employees, reducing the amount of instructor time necessary to train aircrews and maintenance technicians on the new equipment.  End users of the aircraft, such as the major airlines, can purchase the training materials with the aircraft in order to accomplish both  initial and recurrent training of their personnel. Major advantages of CAL are that learners can progress at a rate which is comfortable  for them and are often able to access the CAL at their own convenience.  

Another benefit of CAL is an FAA test prep study guide, useful for preparation for the FAA knowledge tests. These programs  typically allow the learners to select a test, complete the questions, and find out how they did on the test. The learner may then  conduct a review of questions missed.  

Some of the more advanced CAL applications allow learners to progress through a series of interactive segments where the  presentation varies as a result of their responses. They can focus on the area they either need to study or want to study. For example, a  maintenance learner who wants to find information on the refueling of a specific aircraft could use a CAL program to access the  refueling section, and study the entire procedure. If the learner wishes to repeat a section or a portion of the section, it can be done at  any time.  

CAL programs can be used by the instructor as another type of study reference. Just as a learner can reread a section in a text, the  learner may review portions of a CAL program. The instructor should continue to monitor and evaluate the progress of the learner as  usual. This is necessary to be certain a learner is on track with the training syllabus. When using CAL, instructors may do more one­ on-one instruction than in a normal classroom setting, since repetitive forms of teaching may be accomplished by computer.  Remember, the computer has no way of knowing when a learner is having difficulty, and it will always be the responsibility of the  instructor to provide monitoring and oversight of learner progress.  [Figure 5-13]  

Real interactivity with CAL means the learner is fully engaged with the instruction by doing something meaningful which makes the  subject of study come alive. For example, the learner controls the pace of instruction, reviews previous material, jumps forward, and  receives instant feedback.   With   advanced   tracking   features, CAL   also   can   be used   to   test   the learner’s   achievement, compare the  results with past performance, and indicate weak or strong areas.  

For most aviation training, the computer should be thought of as a valuable instructional aid, and CAL is a useful tool for aviation  instructors. For example, in teaching aircraft maintenance, CAL programs produced by various aircraft manufacturers can be used to  expose learners to equipment not normally found at a maintenance school. Another use of computers would allow learners to review  procedures at their own pace while the instructor is involved in hands-on training with others. The major advantage of CAL is that it  is interactive—the computer responds in different ways, depending on learner input. When using CAL, the instructor should remain  actively involved with the learners by using close supervision, questions, examinations, quizzes, or guided discussions on the subject  matter to constantly assess progress.  

![](images/45b8a48319e70e69820f8c10fde75d8f6b7a622feb07ec80decb93078c9875dd.jpg)  
Figure 5-13.  The instructor continually monitors learner performance when using CAL, as with all instructional aids.  

# Simulation, Role-Playing, and Video Gaming  

Simulation (the appearance of real life), role-playing (playing a specific role in the context of a real-world situation), and video  gaming have taken e-learning in new directions.  [Figure 5-14]  The popularity of simulation games that provide players with complex  situations and opportunities to learn have drawn educators into the gaming field as they seek interactive educational games that help  retain subject matter learning.  

The advantages of simulation/role-playing games come as the learner obtains new information, develops skills, connects and  manipulates information. A game gives the learner a stake in the outcome by putting them into the shoes of a character (role-playing)  who needs to overcome a real-world scenario. Learning evolves as a result of the interactions with the game, and these games usually  promote the development of critical thinking skills.  

Not every aviation learning objective can be delivered via this teaching method, but it should prove to be a useful tool in the  instructor’s   tool box   as the number   and   content of   educational games increase.

# Cooperative or Group Learning Method  

Cooperative or group learning organizes learners into small groups who can work together to maximize understanding. Research  indicates that learners completing cooperative learning group tasks tend to have better test scores, higher self-esteem, improved social  skills, and greater comprehension of the subjects they are studying. Perhaps the most significant characteristic of group learning is  that it continually requires active participation in the learning process.  

# Conditions and Controls  

In spite of its advantages, success with cooperative or group learning depends on conditions and controls. First of all, instructors need  to begin planning early to determine what the group is expected to learn and to be able to do on their own. The group task may  emphasize academic achievement, cognitive abilities, or physical skills, but the instructor should use clear and specific objectives to  describe the knowledge and/or abilities the learners are to acquire and then demonstrate on their own.  

The following conditions and controls are useful for cooperative learning:  

⦁  Small, heterogeneous groups  ⦁  Clear, complete instructions of what learners are to do, in what order, with what materials, and when  appropriate—what learners are to do as evidence of their mastery of targeted content and skills  ⦁  Learner perception of targeted objectives as their own, personal objectives  ⦁  The opportunity for learner success  ⦁  Learner access to and comprehension of required information  ⦁  Sufficient time for learning  ⦁  Individual accountability  ⦁  Recognition and rewards for group success  ⦁  Time after completion of group tasks for learners to systematically reflect upon how they worked together as  a team  

In practice, collaborative, learner-led, instructor-led, or working group strategies are types of group learning. In these examples, the  leader or the instructor serves as a coach or facilitator who interacts with the group, as necessary, to keep it on track or to encourage  everyone in the group to participate.  

# Demonstration-Performance Method  

Best used for the mastery of mental or physical skills that require practice, the demonstration-performance method is based on the  principle that people learn by doing. In this method, learners observe the skill and then try to reproduce it. It is well suited for the  aircraft maintenance instructor who uses it in the shop to teach welding, and the flight instructor who uses it in teaching piloting skills.  

Every instructor should recognize the importance of learner performance in the process. Early in demonstration and performance  lesson, the instructor should identify the most important learning outcomes. Next, explain and demonstrate the steps involved in  performing the skill being taught. Then, allow learners time to practice each step, so they can increase their ability to perform the  skill.  

The demonstration-performance method is divided into five phases: explanation, demonstration, learner performance, instructor  supervision, and evaluation.  [Figure 5-15]  

# Explanation Phase  

Explanations need to be clear, pertinent to the objectives of the particular lesson to be presented, and based on the known experience  and knowledge of the learners. In teaching a skill, the instructor conveys to the learners the precise actions they are to perform. In  addition to the necessary steps, the instructor should describe the end result of these efforts. Before leaving this phase, the instructor  should encourage learners to ask questions about any step of the procedure that they do not understand.  

![](images/0e5b6c97651ca5e8f9f8ac91ab5f68d98e15e79680cd809da9e3e005d3d3ba67.jpg)  
Figure 5-15.  The demonstration-performance method of teaching has five essential phases.  

# Demonstration Phase  

The instructor shows learners the actions necessary to perform a skill. Extraneous activity should be excluded from the demonstration  so that learners clearly understand the desired actions. If the demonstration deviates from the explanation, this deviation should be  immediately acknowledged and explained.  

# Learner Performance and Instruction Supervision Phases  

While they involve separate actions, the learner’s performance of the physical or mental skills that and the instructor’s supervision  occur at the same time.  

The instructor needs to allot enough time for meaningful activity. Through doing, learners learn to follow correct procedures and to  reach established standards. It is important that learners be given an opportunity to perform the skill as soon as possible after a  demonstration. In flight training, the instructor may allow the learner to follow along on the controls during the demonstration of a  maneuver. Immediately thereafter, the instructor should have the learner attempt to perform the maneuver, coaching as necessary. In  the opening scenario, learners performed a task (weight and balance computation) as a group, and prior to terminating the  performance phase, they were allowed to independently complete the task at least once with supervision and coaching as necessary.  

# Evaluation Phase  

In this phase, the instructor judges learner performance. The learner displays whatever competence has been attained, and the  instructor identifies how well the skill has been mastered. To test performance ability, the instructor requires learners to work  independently throughout this phase and makes some comment about how each performed the skill relative to the way it was taught.  From this measurement of learner achievement, the instructor determines the effectiveness of the instruction.  

# Drill and Practice Method  

Drill and practice, based on Thorndike's law of exercise discussed in Chapter 3, The Learning Process, predicts that connections are  strengthened with practice. The human mind rarely retains, evaluates, and applies new concepts or practices after one exposure.  Learners do not master welding during one shop period or perform crosswind landings during one instructional flight. They learn by  practicing and applying what they have been told and shown. Every time practice occurs, learning continues. Effective use of drill and  practice revolves around what skill is being developed. The instructor provides opportunities for learners to practice and while  directing the process toward an objective.  

# Conclusion  

A successful instructor needs to be various teaching methods. Although lecture and demonstration-performance methods usually work  well, awareness of other methods and teaching tools such as guided discussion, cooperative learning, and computer-assisted learning  better prepares an instructor for a wide variety of teaching situations.  

Obviously,   the   aviation   instructor    the   key   to   effective   teaching.   The   instructor’s   tools   are   different   teaching   methods.   Just as the  technician uses some tools more than others, the instructor uses some methods more often than others. As is the case with the  technician, there are times when a less used tool is the exact tool needed for a particular situation. The instructor’s success is  determined to a large degree by the ability to organize material and to select and utilize a teaching method appropriate to a particular  lesson.  

# Application of the Lesson  

Application    the learner’s   use of   the presented   material.    it is   a classroom   presentation,   the learner   may   be asked    explain the new  material. If it is a new flight maneuver, the learner may be asked to perform the maneuver just been demonstrated. In most  instructional situations,   the instructor’s   explanation   and   demonstration   activities   alternate with   learner   performance   efforts. Usually  the instructor offers corrections and further demonstrations. This is necessary because each learner needs to perform the maneuver or  operation the right way the first few times to establish a good habit. Faulty habits are difficult to correct and need to be addressed as  soon as possible. Flight instructors should know about this issue since learners often practice without an instructor. Periodic review  and assessment by the instructor is necessary to ensure that the learner has not acquired any bad habits, and learners should practice  maneuvers on solo flights only after demonstrating reasonable competence.  

As the learner becomes proficient with the fundamentals of flight and aircraft maneuvers or maintenance procedures, the instructor  should increasingly emphasize ADM as a means of applying what has been previously learned. For example, the flight learner may be  asked to plan for the arrival at a specific nontowered airport. The planning should take into consideration the wind conditions, arrival  paths, communication procedures, available runways, recommended traffic patterns, and courses of action in the event the unexpected  occurs. Upon arrival at the airport the learner makes decisions (with guidance and feedback as necessary) to safely enter and fly the  traffic pattern.  

# Assessment of the Lesson  

Before the end of the instructional period, the instructor should review what has been covered during the lesson and ask the learners  to demonstrate how well the lesson objectives have been met. Review and assessment are integral parts of each classroom, or flight  lesson.   The instructor’s   assessment may   be informal and   recorded   only   for   the instructor’s   own   use in   planning   the next lesson, or it  may   be formal.   Often,   the assessment is   formal and   results   recorded   to   certify   the learner’s   progress   in   the course.   Assessment is  explored in more detail in Chapter 6.  

# Instructional Aids and Training Technologies  

Instructional aids are devices that assist an instructor in the teaching-learning process. Instructional aids are not self-supporting; they  support, supplement, or reinforce what is being taught. In contrast, training media are generally described as any physical means that  communicates   an   instructional message to   learners.   For   example,   the instructor’s   voice,   printed   text, video   cassettes, interactive  computer programs, part-task trainers, flight training devices, or flight simulators, and numerous other types of training devices are  considered training media.  

In school settings, instructors may be involved in the selection and preparation of instructional aids, but they often are already in  place. An independent instructor may select or prepare instructional aids. Whatever the setting, instructors need to know how to use  them effectively.  

# Instructional Aid Theory  

There is general agreement about certain factors that seem pertinent to understanding the use of instructional aids.  

⦁  Carefully selected charts, graphs, pictures, or other well-organized visual aids are examples of items that      help the learner understand, as well as retain, essential information.  ⦁  Ideally, instructional aids cover the key points and concepts.  ⦁  The coverage should be straightforward and factual so it is easy for learners to remember and recall.  ⦁  Generally, instructional aids that are relatively simple are best.  

# Reasons for Use of Instructional Aids  

Properly used instructional aids help gain and hold the attention of learners. Audio or visual aids can be very useful in supporting a  topic, and the combination of both audio and visual stimuli is particularly effective since the two most important senses are involved.  One caution—the instructional aid should keep learner attention on the subject; it should not be a distracting gimmick.  

Clearly, a major goal of all instruction is for the learner to be able to retain as much knowledge of the subject as possible, especially  the key points. Numerous studies have attempted to determine how well instructional aids serve this purpose. Indications from the  studies vary greatly—from modest results, which show a 10 to 15 percent increase in retention, to more optimistic results in which  retention is increased by as much as 80 percent.  [Figure 5-16]  

![](images/4ff62d9f4be43dfb0caacb0a01b85fc6195688c3e8b91aed5c68b4ecc23bc6b0.jpg)  
Figure 5-16.  Studies generally agree that measurable improvement in learner retention of information occurs when instruction is  supported by appropriate instructional aids.  

Good instructional aids also can help solve certain language barrier problems. Consider the continued expansion of technical  terminology   in   everyday   usage.   This,   coupled   with   culturally   diverse backgrounds   of   today’s   learners,   makes it necessary   for   instructors to be precise in their choice of terminology. Words or terms used in an instructional aid should be carefully selected to  convey the same meaning for the learner as they do for the instructor. They should provide an accurate visual image and make  learning easier.  

Another use for instructional aids is to clarify the relationships between material objects and concepts. When relationships are  presented visually, they often are much easier to understand. For example, the subsystems within a physical unit are relatively easy to  relate to each other through the use of schematics or diagrams. Symbols, graphs, and diagrams can also show relationships of  location, size, time, frequency, and value. By symbolizing the factors involved, it is even possible to visualize abstract relationships.  

Instructors are frequently asked to teach more and more in a smaller time frame. Instructional aids can help them do this. For  example, instead of using many words to describe a sound, object, or function, the instructor plays a recording of the sound, shows a  picture of the object, or presents a diagram of the function. Consequently, the learner gains knowledge faster and more accurately,  and the instructor saves time in the process.  

# Guidelines for Use of Instructional Aids  

T he use of any instructional aid should be planned, based on its ability to support a specific point in a lesson. The following process  can be used to determine if and where instructional aids are necessary:  

⦁  Clearly establish the lesson objective. Be certain of what is to be communicated.  ⦁  Gather the necessary data by researching for support material.  

⦁  Organize the material into an outline or a lesson plan. The plan should include all key points that need to be      covered. This may include important safety considerations.  

⦁  Select the ideas to be supported with instructional aids. The aids should be concentrated on the key points.      Aids are often appropriate when long segments of technical description are necessary, when a point is      complex and difficult to put into words, when instructors find themselves forming visual images, or when      learners are puzzled by an explanation or description.  

Aids should be simple and compatible with the learning outcomes to be achieved. Obviously, an explanation of elaborate equipment  may require detailed schematics or mock-ups, but less complex equipment may lend itself to only basic shapes or figures. Since aids  are normally used in conjunction with a verbal presentation, words on the aid should be kept to a minimum. In many cases, visual  symbols and slogans can replace in-depth explanations. The instructor should avoid the temptation to use the aids as a crutch. The  tendency toward unnecessarily distracting artwork should be avoided.  

Instructional aids should appeal to the learner and be based on sound principles of instructional design. When practical, they should  encourage learner participation. They also should be meaningful to the learner, lead to the desired behavioral objectives, and provide  appropriate reinforcement. Aids that involve mastering a physical skill should guide learners toward mastery of the skill or task  specified in the lesson objective.  

Instructional aids have no value in the learning process if they cannot be heard or seen. Recordings of sounds and speeches should be  tested for correct volume and quality in the actual environment in which they will be used. Visual aids should be visible to the entire  class. All lettering and illustrations need to be large enough to be seen easily by the learners farthest from the aids. Colors should  provide clear contrast.  

While many instructional aids come with purchased material, the effectiveness of instructor-produced aids and the ease of their  preparation can be increased by initially planning them in rough draft form. The rough draft should be carefully checked for technical  accuracy, proper terminology, grammar, spelling, basic balance, clarity, and simplicity. Instructional aids should also be reviewed to  determine whether their use is feasible in the training environment and whether they are appropriate for the learners. See the figure for  a summary of the desired qualities of instructional aids.  [Figure 5-17]  

![](images/183e7adfd6ffdc71a7516608f5a793bcea99aabeb27db5f04ffef346dd6a533a.jpg)  
Figure 5-17.  Guidelines for effective instructional aids.  

# Types of Instructional Aids  

Some of the most common and economical aids are marker boards and supplemental print materials, including charts, diagrams, and  graphs. Other aids include projected material, video, computer-based programs, and models, mock-ups, or cut-aways.  

# Marker Board  

The marker board is a classroom tool for instructors. Its versatility and effectiveness provide several advantages for most types of  instruction. First, the material presented can be erased, allowing the surface to be used again and again; and second, the boards serve  as an excellent medium for joint learner-instructor activity in the classroom.  

# Supplemental Print Material  

Print media, including photographs, reproductions of pictures, drawings, murals, cartoons, and other print materials are valuable  supplemental aids. Charts, diagrams, and graphs are also in this category. Many of these items are suitable for long-term use on  bulletin boards and in briefing areas. Pictures, drawings, and photographs are especially effective because they provide common  visual imagery for both instructors and learners. In addition, they also provide realistic details necessary for visual recognition of  important subject material. In many cases, this type of supplemental training media may be reproduced in a format for projection on a  screen or other clear surface.  

# Enhanced Training Materials  

Training syllabi represent enhanced training material and contain provisions for instructor endorsements and recordkeeping. Such  syllabi not only present the course of training in a logical step-by-step, building block sequence, they contain provisions to remind  both learners and instructors of critical regulatory training benchmarks which are approaching. When required endorsements and  recordkeeping   provisions   are   designed   into   training   syllabi,   it is   much   easier,   from   the   instructor’s   standpoint,   to   conduct   required  training, track learner progress, and certify records. The training record can be reviewed and the training status easily assessed in case  the learner transfers to another school or instructor.  

Another example of enhanced, instructor-oriented material for pilot training is a maneuvers guide or handbook which includes the  ACS as an integral part of the description of maneuvers and procedures. From the beginning learners understand how to perform the  maneuver or procedure and also become familiar with the performance criteria. The examiner for the Airframe and Powerplant  (A&P) is required to ask four questions in each of the subject areas, which are required by the regulations to be taught. The examiner  also is required to assign a practical project from each subject area. Individual maintenance instructors, as well as publishers, have  compiled lists of typical questions and projects. Use of these questions and projects as part of the syllabus helps an instructor ensure  that all subject areas for a particular class have been covered.  

# Projected Material  

Whatever type of projected training aid used, it is essential for the content to be current and support the lesson. Use of projected  materials requires planning and practice. The instructor should set up and adjust the equipment and lighting beforehand and then  preview the presentation. During a classroom session, the instructor should provide learners with an overview of the presentation  before showing it. After the presentation, the instructor should allow time for questions and a summary of key points.  

Computers   have   changed   the   way   information    presented   to   today’s   learner.   A   laptop   computer   may   be   all that    needed   for   the  one-on-one presentation. For groups, the instructor can tailor the presentation for the class and use a large screen or other viewing  system.  

# Video  

Instructors need to follow some basic guidelines when using video. The presentation is not designed to replace the instructor. Prior  planning will help determine the important points and concepts that should be stressed, either during the presentation or summary.  Instructors should be available to summarize the presentation and answer any questions learners may have regarding content.  

# Interactive Systems  

“Interactive”   refers   broadly   to   computer   software   that   responds   quickly   to   certain   choices   and   commands   by   the   user.   A   typical  system consists of interactive material and a computer. With search-and-find features incorporated, the system is a powerful  information source. The software may include additional features such as image banks with full color photos and graphics, as well as  questions or directions which are programmed to create interactivity for learners as they progress through the course.  

The questions or directions are programmed using a branching technique, which provides several possible courses of action for the  user    choose in   order    move from   one sequence    another.   For   example,   a program   may   indicate,   “That was incorrect. Go   back to  … and   try   again.”  

# Computer-Assisted Learning (CAL)  

As mentioned earlier, CAL has become a popular training delivery method. In its basic form, CAL is a combination of more than one  instructional media, such as audio, text, graphics, and video (or film) usually shown on a PC.  

With CAL, the roles of both learner and instructor change. Learners become more involved and instructors may no longer occupy a  center-stage position in a typical classroom setting. Instead, instructors become supportive facilitators. As such, they serve as guides  or resource experts and circulate among learners who are working individually or in small groups. This results in considerable one­ on-one instructor-learner interaction. Thus, the instructor provides assistance, reinforcement, and answers for those who need it most.  

In this situation, the CAL should still be considered as an add-on instructional aid to improve traditional classroom instruction. The  instructor, although no longer the center of attention, continues to maintain adequate control over the learning environment to ensure  learning objectives are being achieved.  [Figure 5-18]  

A more advanced application of computer-based training may involve less instructor control. For example, a laboratory-type  environment may be configured with separate study areas for each learner. With this setup, the physical facility is usually referred to  as a learning center or training center.  

Learners   in   these   centers   are   often   monitored   by   a teacher’s   aide   or   other   trained   personnel   who   can   provide   guidance,   answer   questions, and act as a conduit to the instructor who is responsible for the training. In this case, the responsible instructor needs to  establish procedures to make sure the required training is accomplished, since he or she certif ie s learner competency at the end of the  course.

Figure 5-18.  In a computer-assisted learning environment, the instructor still ensures that learning objectives are being achieved.  

# Models, Mock-ups, and Cut-Aways  

Models, mock-ups, and cut-aways are additional instructional aids. A model is a copy of a real object. It can be an enlargement, a  reduction, or the same size as the original. The scale model represents an exact reproduction of the original, while simplified models  do not represent reality in all details. Some models are solid and show only the outline of the object they portray, while others can be  manipulated or operated.  

Although a model may not be a realistic copy of an actual piece of equipment, it can be used effectively in explaining operating  principles of various types of equipment. Models are especially adaptable to small group discussions in which learners are  encouraged to ask questions. A model is even more effective if it works like the original, and if it can be taken apart and reassembled.  With the display of an operating model, the learners can observe how each part works in relation to the other parts. When the  instructor points to each part of the model while explaining these relationships, the learners can better understand the mechanical  principles involved. As instructional aids, models are usually more practical than originals because they are lightweight and easy to  manipulate.  

A mock-up is a three-dimensional or specialized type of working model made from real or synthetic materials. It is used for study,  training, or testing in place of the real object, which is too costly or too dangerous, or which is impossible to obtain. The mock-up  may emphasize or highlight elements or components for learning and eliminate nonessential elements.  

Cut-aways, another type of model, are built in sections and can be taken apart to reveal the internal structure. Whenever possible, the  various parts should be labeled or colored to clarify relationships.  

Production and equipment costs are limiting factors to consider in developing and using models, mock-ups, and cut-aways.  Depending on the nature of the representation, cost can vary. For instance, scale replicas are often very expensive. In general, if a  two-dimensional representation   will satisfy   the instructor’s   requirement, it should   be used.  

# Test Preparation Material  

Test preparation material applies to an array of paper, video, and computer software products that are designed by commercial  publishers to help learner applicants prepare for FAA tests. While test preparation materials may be effective in preparing for FAA  tests, the danger is that learners may be able to pass a given test, but fail to learn other critical information essential to safe piloting  and maintenance practices. FAA inspectors and designated examiners report that learner applicants sometimes exhibit a lack of  knowledge during oral questioning, even though many have easily passed the FAA knowledge test. A major shortcoming of test  preparation materials is that the emphasis is on rote learning, which is the lowest of all levels of learning.  

Test preparation materials, as well as instructors, that dwell on teaching the test are shortchanging learner applicants. All instructors  who use test preparation publications should stress that these materials are not designed as stand-alone learning tools. They should be  considered as a supplement to instructor-led training.  

# Future Developments  

Electronic communications, including use of computer databases, voice mail, e-mail, Internet, World Wide Web, and satellite-based,  wireless communications, are routine and this explosion of information access affects aviation training. It will be even more  significant in the future.  

Computer technology continues to advance in quantum leaps, challenging traditional ways of teaching. For example, voice- recognition technology, which lets computers accept spoken rather than keyed input, is highly effective for technical training.  

Miniature electro-optical devices allow computer-aided information to be projected electronically on sunglass-style eye wear which is  connected to a lightweight, belt mounted computer. Computer-aided information is particularly useful for aviation maintenance  activities.   For   example,   it would   be possible for   a technician’s   eyes to   easily   move back   and   forth   from   computer-generated technical  data to the actual hardware while diagnosing and correcting a maintenance problem.  

Trends in training indicate a shift from the typical classroom to more extensive use of a lab-type environment with computer work or  study stations. Using simulation devices, computer networks, and multimedia programs, learners become more actively involved and  responsible for their own training. Aviation-related learning centers are usually associated with colleges, universities, and research  centers. The airlines, as well as aeronautical programs at some colleges and universities, have used similar facilities for many years.  

Another type of computer-based technology, virtual reality (VR), creates a sensory experience that allows a participant to believe and  barely distinguish a virtual experience from a real one. VR uses graphics with animation systems, sounds, and images to reproduce  electronic versions of real-life experience. Despite enormous potential, VR is expensive.  

For those engaged in aviation training, the challenge is staying abreast of technological changes that apply to training and adopting  those that are the most useful and cost effective. Since much of the new technology is based on computer technology, instructors with  well-developed computer skills are in demand.  

While evaluating new teaching methods and technology, instructors should remember their main teaching goals. Electronic  information on computer networks and bulletin boards may come from reputable publishers, as well as community, state, and national  government agencies. There is, however, no guarantee that all of this information is current or even accurate.  

# Chapter Summary  

As indicated by this discussion, the teaching process organizes the material an instructor wishes to teach in such a way that the learner  understands what is being taught. An effective instructor uses a combination of teaching methods as well as instructional aids to  achieve this goal.  

By being well prepared, an effective instructor presents and applies lesson material, and also periodically assesses learning. An  effective instructor never stops learning. He or she maintains currency in the subject matter being taught, as well as how to teach it by  reading professional journals and other aviation publications, many of which can be viewed or purchased via the Internet, another  source of valuable aviation information for professional instructors.  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 6: Assessment  

# Introduction  

Assessment is an essential component of teaching and learning, and it provides the instructor with immediate feedback on the quality  of   instruction.   Instructors   continuously   evaluate a learner’s   performance   in   order   to   provide guidance,   suggestions   for   improvement,  and positive reinforcement.  

This   chapter   examines the instructor’s   role when   assessing   levels of   learning,   it describes methods   of   assessment, and   it discusses how  instructors may construct and conduct effective assessments. Since learners are different and each situation is unique,  instructors individualize an asse s sment as needed. Aviation in s tructors can use th e  techniques and methods described in this  chapter as appropriate.  

# Assessment Terminology  

This chapter presents two broad categories of assessment. The first is traditional assessment, which often involves the kind of written  testing (e.g., multiple choice, matching) and grading that is most familiar to instructors and learners. To achieve a passing score on a  traditional assessment, the learner usually has a set amount of time to recognize or reproduce memorized terms, formulas, or data.  There is   a single answer   that is   correct. Consequently,   the traditional assessment usually   assesses the learner’s   progress   at   the rote and  understanding levels of learning. However, carefully crafted scenario questions can assess higher levels of learning.  

The second category of assessment is authentic assessment. Authentic assessment requires the learner to demonstrate not just rote and  understanding, but also the application and correlation levels of learning. Authentic assessment generally requires the learner to  perform real-world tasks and demonstrate a meaningful application of skills and competencies. In other words, the authentic  assessment requires the learner to exhibit in-depth knowledge by generating a solution instead of merely choosing a response.  

In authentic assessment, there are specific performance criteria, or standards, that learners know in advance of the actual assessment.  The   terms   “criteria/criterion”   and   “standard”   are   often   used   interchangeably.   They   refer   to   the   characteristics   that   define   acceptable  performance   on   a task.   Another   term   used   in   association   with   authentic   assessment    “rubric.”   A   rubric    a guide   used   to   score  performance assessments in a reliable, fair, and valid manner. It is generally composed of dimensions for judging learner  performance, a scale for rating performances on each dimension, and standards of excellence for specified performance levels.  

Whether knowledge or skill, an assessment can be either formal or informal. Formal assessments usually involve documentation, such  as a quiz or written examination. They are used periodically throughout a course, as well as at the end of a course, to measure and  document whether or not the course objectives have been met. Informal assessments, which can include verbal critique, generally  occur as needed and are not part of the final grade.  

Other terms associated with assessment include diagnostic, formative, and summative.  ⦁  Diagnostic assessments assess learner knowledge or skills prior to a course of instruction.  

⦁  Formative assessments, which are not graded, provide a wrap-up of the lesson and set the stage for      the next lesson. This type of assessment, limited to what transpired during that lesson, informs the      instructor what to reinforce.  

⦁  Summative assessments, used periodically throughout the training, measure how well learning has      progressed to that point. For example, a stage-check, a chapter quiz, or an end-of-course test can measure      the learner’s   overall mastery   of   the training.   These assessments   are an   integral part of   the lesson,   as well as       the course of training.  

# Purpose of Assessment  

An effective assessment provides critical information to both the instructor and the learner. Both instructor and learner need to know  how well the learner is progressing. A good assessment provides practical and specific feedback to learners. This includes direction  and guidance indicating how they may raise their level of performance. Most importantly, a well-designed and effective assessment  provides an opportunity for self-evaluation that enhances the learner's aeronautical decision-making and judgment skills.  

A well-designed   assessment highlights   the areas    which   a learner’s   performance    incorrect or   inadequate,   it helps   the instructor   see  where more emphasis is needed. If, for example, several learners falter when they reach the same step in a weight-and-balance  problem, the instructor should recognize the need for a more detailed explanation, another demonstration of the step, or special  emphasis in the assessment of subsequent performance.  

# General Characteristics of Effective Assessment  

In   order   to   provide direction   and   raise the learner’s   level of   performance,   assessment needs    be factual,   and   it should   align with the  completion standards of the lesson. An effective assessment displays the characteristics shown in  Figure 6-1.  

![](images/eb59b2a447dd237708a5a0395a7116cd615f9bf33ccf1574e315bb83d1cd5415.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.  Effective assessments share a number of characteristics.  

# Objective  

The personal opinions, likes, dislikes, or biases of the instructor might affect an assessment. A conflict of personalities can alter an  opinion. Sympathy or over-identification   with   a learner,   to   such   a degree   that it influences   objectivity,    known   as “halo   error.” To   what extent does effective assessment need to focus on objectivity and actual learner performance? If an assessment is to be effective,  it needs to be honest; and it must be based on the facts of the performance as they were, not as they could have been.  

# Flexible  

The instructor should evaluate the entire performance of a learner in the context in which it is accomplished. Sometimes a good  learner turns in a poor performance, and a poor learner turns in a good one. A friendly learner may suddenly become hostile, or a  hostile learner may suddenly become friendly and cooperative. The instructor fits the tone, technique, and content of the assessment  to the occasion, as well as to the learner. An assessment should be designed and executed so that the instructor can allow for  variables. The ongoing challenge for the instructor is deciding what to say, what to omit, what to stress, and what to minimize at the  proper moment.  

# Acceptable  

Consider that learners do not like negative feedback. What makes an honest assessment acceptable to the learner? A certificate or  credential alone rarely   suffices. Learners   need   to   have confidence   in   the instructor’s   qualifications,   teaching   ability,   sincerity,  competence, and authority. Usually, instructors have the opportunity to establish themselves with learners before the formal  assessment arises. If   not, however,   the instructor’s   manner,   attitude,   and   familiarity   with   the subject at hand   serves this   purpose.  Assessments presented fairly, with authority, conviction, sincerity, and from a position of recognizable competence tend to work well.  

# Comprehensive  

A comprehensive assessment is not necessarily a long one, nor need it treat every aspect of the performance in detail. While it  includes strengths as well as weaknesses, the degree of coverage of each should fit the situation. The instructor might report what  most needs improvement, or only what the learner can reasonably be expected to improve. The instructor decides whether the greater  benefit comes from a discussion of a few major points or a number of minor points.  

# Constructive  

An assessment is pointless unless the learner benefits from it. Praise can capitalize on things that are done well and inspire the learner  to improve in areas of lesser accomplishment. When identifying a mistake or weakness, the instructor needs to give positive guidance  for correction. Praise for its own sake or negative comments that do not point toward improvement or a higher level of performance  should be omitted from an assessment altogether.  

# Organized  

An assessment must be organized. Almost any pattern is acceptable, as long as it is logical and makes sense to the learner. An  effective organizational pattern might be the sequence of the performance itself. Sometimes an assessment can begin at the point at  which a demonstration failed, and work backward through the steps that led to the failure. A success can be analyzed in similar  fashion. Alternatively, a glaring deficiency can serve as the core of an assessment. Breaking the whole into parts, or building the parts  into a whole, is another possible organizational approach.  

# Thoughtful  

An   effective   assessment   reflects   the   instructor’s   thoughtfulness   toward   the learner’s   need   for   self-esteem, recognition, and approval.  The instructor refrains from minimizing the inherent dignity and importance of the individual. Ridicule, anger, or fun at the expense  of the learner has no place in assessment. While being straightforward and honest, the instructor should always respect the learner’s personal feelings. For example, the instructor should try to deliver criticism in private.  

# Specific  

The   instructor’s   comments   and   recommendations   should   be   specific.   Learners   cannot   act   on   recommendations   unless   they   know   specifically   what   the   recommendations   are.   A   statement   such   as, “Your   second   weld   wasn’t   as good   as your   first,”   has   little  constructive value. Instead, the instructor should say why it was not as good and offer suggestions on how to improve the weld. If the  instructor has a clear, well-founded, and supportable idea in mind, it should be expressed with firmness and authority, and in terms  that cannot be misunderstood. At the conclusion of an assessment, learners should have no doubt about what they did well and what  they did poorly and, most importantly, specifically how they can improve.  

# Traditional Assessment  

As defined earlier, traditional assessment generally refers to written testing, such as multiple choice, matching, true/false, fill in the  blank, etc. Learners typically complete written assessments within a specified time. There is a single, correct response for each item.  The assessment, or test, assumes that all learners should learn the same thing, and relies on rote memorization of facts. Responses are  often machine scored and offer little opportunity for a demonstration of the thought processes characteristic of critical thinking skills.  

Traditional assessment lends itself to instructor centered teaching styles. The instructor teaches the material at a low level, and  the measure of perform a nce is limited. In traditional assessment, fairly simple grading matrices such as shown in  Figure 6-2  are used.  Due to this approach, a satisfactory grade for one lesson may not reflect a learner's ability to apply knowledge in a different situation.  

Still, tests of this nature do have a place in the assessment hierarchy. Multiple choice, supply type, and other such tests are useful in  assessing   the   learner’s   grasp   of   information,   concepts,   terms,   processes,   and   rules—factual knowledge that forms the foundation  needed for the learner to advance to higher levels of learning.  

# Characteristics of a Good Written Assessment (Test)  

Whether or not an instructor designs his or her own tests or uses commercially available test banks, it is important to know the  components of an effective test.  (Note: This section is intended to introduce basic concepts of written-test design. Please see  Appendix A for testing and test-writing publications.)  

![](images/f324aafe01b5e9d5564d578029803ef30f692f0dc023146f76ab36474cb635d2.jpg)  
Figure 6-2.  Traditional grading.  

A test is a set of questions, problems, or exercises intended to determine whether the learner possesses a particular knowledge or skill.  A test can consist of just one test item, but it usually consists of a number of test items. A test item measures a single objective and  calls for a single response. The test could be as simple as the correct answer to an essay question or as complex as completing a  knowledge or practical test. Regardless of the underlying purpose, effective tests share certain characteristics.  [Figure 6-3]  

![](images/5c2d229910ad17fc4604d1549b5a91ad5926fd92ff54f0d203dd4b2af3c8713c.jpg)  
Figure 6-3.  Effective tests have six primary characteristics.  

Reliability is the degree to which test results are consistent with repeated measurements. If identical measurements are obtained every  time a certain instrument is applied to a certain dimension, the instrument is considered reliable. The reliability of a written test is  judged by whether it gives consistent measurement to a particular individual or group. Keep in mind, though, that knowledge, skills,  and understanding can improve with subsequent attempts at taking the same test, because the first test serves as a learning device.  

Validity is the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure, and it is the most important consideration in test  evaluation. The instructor must carefully consider whether the test actually measures what it is supposed to measure. To estimate  validity, several instructors read the test critically and consider its content relative to the stated objectives of the instruction. Items that  do not pertain directly to the objectives of the course should be modified or eliminated.  

Usability refers to the functionality of tests. A usable written test is easy to give if it is printed in a type size large enough for learners  to read easily. The wording of both the directions for taking the test and of the test items needs to be clear and concise. Graphics,  charts, and illustrations appropriate to the test items must be clearly drawn, and the test should be easily graded.  

Objectivity describes singleness of scoring of a test. Essay questions provide an example of this principle. It is nearly impossible to  prevent an   instructor’s   own   knowledge and   experience   in   the subject area,   writing   style,   or   grammar   from   affecting   the grade  awarded. Selection-type test items, such as true/false or multiple choice, are much easier to grade objectively.  

Comprehensiveness is the degree to which a test measures the overall objectives. Suppose, for example, an AMT wants to measure  the compression of an aircraft engine. Measuring compression on a single cylinder would not provide an indication of the entire  engine. Similarly, a written test must sample an appropriate cross-section of the objectives of instruction. The instructor makes certain  the evaluation includes a representative and comprehensive sampling of the objectives of the course.  

Discrimination is the degree to which a test distinguishes the difference between learners and may be appropriate for assessment of  academic achievement. However, minimum standards are far more important in assessments leading to pilot certification. If necessary  for classroom evaluation of academic achievement, a test must measure small differences in achievement in relation to the objectives  of the course. A test designed for discrimination contains:  

1.   A wide range of scores  2.   All levels of difficulty  3.   Items that distinguish between learners with differing levels of achievement of the course objectives  

Please see Appendix B for information on the advantages and disadvantages of multiple choice, supply type, and other written  assessment instruments, as well as guidance on creating effective test items.  

# Authentic Assessment  

Authentic assessment asks the learner to perform real-world tasks and demonstrate a meaningful application of skills and  competencies. Authentic assessment lies   at the heart of   training   today’s   aviation   learner   to   use critical thinking   skills.   Rather than  selecting from predetermined responses, learners must generate responses from skills and concepts they have learned. By using open- ended questions and established performance criteria, authentic assessment focuses on the learning process, enhances the  development of real-world skills, encourages higher order thinking skills, and teaches learners to assess their own work and  performance.  

# Learner-Centered Assessment  

There are several aspects of effective authentic assessment. The first is the use of open-ended questions in what might be called a  “collaborative critique,” which    a form   of   learner-centered grading. As described in the scenario that introduced this chapter, the  instructor begins by using a four-step series of open-ended questions to guide the learner through a complete self-assessment.  

Replay—the instructor asks the learner to verbally replay the flight or procedure. While the learner speaks, the instructor listens for  areas where the account does not seem accurate. At the right moment, the instructor discusses any discrepancy with the learner. This  approach gives the learner a chance to validate his or her own perceptions, and it gives the instructor critical insight into the learner's  judgment abilities.  

Reconstruct—the reconstruction stage encourages learning by identifying the key things that the learner would have, could have, or  should have done differently during the flight or procedure.  

Reflect—insights come from investing perceptions and experiences with meaning, requiring reflection on the events. For example:  

1.   What was the most important thing you learned today?  2.   What part of the session was easiest for you? What part was hardest?  3.   Did anything make you uncomfortable? If so, when did it occur?  4.   How would you assess your performance and your decisions?  5.   How did your performance compare to the standards in the ACS?  

Redirect—the final step is to help the learner relate lessons learned in this session to other experiences and consider how they might  help in future sessions. Questions might include:  

⦁  What might be done to mitigate a similar risk in a future situation?  ⦁  Which aspects of this experience might apply to future situations, and how?  

⦁  What personal minimums should be established, and what additional proficiency flying and/or training      might be useful?  

Any self-assessment stimulates growth   in   the learner’s   thought processes and,   in   turn,   behaviors.   An   in-depth discussion between the  instructor   and   the learner   may   follow,   which   compares the instructor’s   assessment to   the learner’s   self-assessment. Through this  discussion,   the instructor   and   the learner   jointly   determine the learner’s   progress.   The progress   may   be recorded   on   a rubric   as part of  a training program. As explained earlier, a rubric is a guide for scoring performance assessments in a reliable, fair, and valid manner.  It is generally composed of dimensions for judging learner performance, a scale for rating performances on each dimension, and  standards of excellence for specified performance levels.  

The collaborative assessment process in learner-centered   grading   uses two   broad   rubrics:   one that assesses the learner’s   level of   proficiency on skill-focused   maneuvers   or   procedures, and   one that assesses the learner’s   level of   proficiency   on   single-pilot resource  management (SRM), which is the cognitive or decision-making aspect of flight training.  

The performance assessment dimensions for each type of rubric are as follows:  

# Maneuver or Procedure “Grades”  

⦁  Describe—at the completion of the scenario, the learner is able to describe the physical characteristics and      cognitive elements of the scenario activities but needs assistance to execute the maneuver or procedure      successfully.  ⦁  Explain—at the completion of the scenario, the learner is able to describe the scenario activity and      understand the underlying concepts, principles, and procedures that comprise the activity, but needs      assistance to execute the maneuver or procedure successfully.  ⦁  Practice—at the completion of the scenario, the learner is able to plan and execute the scenario. Coaching,      instruction, and/or assistance will correct deviations and errors identified by the instructor.  ⦁  Perform—at the completion of the scenario, the learner is able to perform the activity without instructor      assistance. The learner will identify and correct errors and deviations in an expeditious manner. At no time      will the successful completion of the activity be in doubt. (“Perform”   is used to signify that the learner is      satisfactorily demonstrating proficiency in traditional piloting and systems operation skills).  ⦁  Not observed—any event not accomplished or required.  

For example, a learner can describe a landing and can tell the flight instructor about the physical characteristics and appearance of the  landing. On a good day, with the wind straight down the runway, the learner may be able to practice landings with some success while  still functioning at the rote level of learning. However, on a gusty crosswind day the learner needs a deeper level of understanding to  adapt to the different conditions. If a learner can explain all the basic physics associated with lift/drag and crosswind correction, he or  she is more likely to practice successfully and eventually perform a landing under a wide variety of conditions.  

# Assessing Risk Management Skills  

⦁  Explain—the learner can verbally identify, describe, and understand the risks inherent in the flight scenario,      but needs to be prompted to identify risks and make decisions.  ⦁  Practice—the learner is able to identify, understand, and apply SRM principles to the actual flight situation.      Coaching, instruction, and/or assistance quickly corrects minor deviations and errors identified by the      instructor. The learner is an active decision maker.  ⦁  Manage-Decide—the learner can correctly gather the most important data available both inside and outside      the flight deck, identify possible courses of action, evaluate the risk inherent in each course of action, and      make the appropriate decision. Instructor intervention is not required for the safe completion of the flight.  

In SRM, the learner may be able to describe basic SRM principles during the first flight. Later, he or she is able to explain how SRM  applies to different scenarios that are presented on the ground and in the air. When the learner actually begins to make quality  decisions based on good SRM techniques, he or she earns a grade of manage-decide. The advantage of this type of grading is that  both flight instructor and learner know exactly where the learning has progressed.  

Let’s look at how the rubric in  Figure 6-4  might be used in a flight training scenario. During the postflight debriefing,  flight instructor   Linda asks her learner, Brian, to assess his performance for the day using the Replay, Reconstruct, Reflect, and Redirect guided  discussion questions described in the Learner-Centered Assessment section presented earlier in this chapter. Based on this  assessment, she and Brian discuss where Brian’s performance falls in the rubrics for maneuvers/procedures and SRM. This part of the  assessment may be verbally discussed or, alternatively, Brian and Linda separately create an assessment sheet for each element of the  flight.  

![](images/7671309bf881b93b1615963e6f3bc646d1f83e71ac62d6772fbcc85f363649e5.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.  Rubric for assessing flight training maneuvers.  

When   Brian   studies the performance   levels, he decides he was at the “Perform” level since   he had   not made any   mistakes. Where   he  had   rated   the item   as “Perform,” Linda had   rated   it as “Practice.” During   the ensuing   discussion,   Brian   understands   where he needs  more practice before his   performance    at the “Perform” level.  

This approach to assessment has several key advantages. One is that it actively involves the learner in the assessment process and  establishes the habit of healthy reflection and self-assessment that is critical to being a safe pilot. Another is that these grades are not  self-esteem   related,   since   they   do   not describe a recognized   level of   prestige (such   as   $\mathrm{A}+$   or   “Outstanding”),   but rather   a level of  performance. The learner cannot flunk a lesson. Instead, he or she demonstrates a particular level of flight and SRM skills.  

Both instructors and learners may initially be reluctant to use this method of assessment. Instructors may think it requires more time,  when in fact it is merely a more structured, effective, and collaborative version of a traditional postflight critique. Also, instructors  who learned in the more traditional assessment structure must be careful not to equate or force the dimensions of the rubric into the  traditional grading mold of A through F. One way to avoid this temptation is to remember that evaluation should be progressive: the  learner   may   achieve a new   level of   learning   during   each   lesson.   For   example,   in   flight one,   a task   might be a “describe”   item. By  flight three,   it is   a “practice”   item,   and   by   flight five,   it is   a “manage-decide”   item.  

The learner may be reluctant to self-assess if he or she has not had the chance to participate in such a process before. Therefore, the  instructor may need to teach the learner how to become an active participant in the collaborative assessment.  

# Choosing an Effective Assessment Method  

When deciding how to assess learner progress, aviation instructors can follow a four-step process.  

1.   Determine level-of-learning objectives.  2.   List indicators of desired behaviors.  3.   Establish criterion objectives.  4.   Develop criterion-referenced test items.  

This process is useful for tests that apply to the cognitive and affective domains of learning, and also can be used for skill testing in  the psychomotor domain. The development process for criterion-referenced tests follows a general-to-specific pattern.  [Figure 6-5]  

![](images/d6a3a2f2c10683aa6f54f47a50718cdf5118311f2642bb621bac2eb0ceb4123b.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.  The development process for criterion-referenced tests follows a general-to-specific pattern.  

Instructors should be aware that authentic assessment may not be as useful as traditional assessment in the early phases of training,  because the learner does not have enough information about the concepts or knowledge to participate fully. As discussed in Chapter  3, The Learning Process, when exposed to a new topic, learners first tend to acquire and memorize facts. As learning progresses, they  begin to organize their knowledge to formulate an understanding of the things they have memorized. When learners possess the  knowledge needed to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate (i.e., application and correlation levels of learning), they can participate more  fully in the assessment process.  

# Determine Level-of-Learning Objectives  

The first step in developing an appropriate assessment is to state the individual objectives as general, level-of-learning objectives. The  objectives should measure one of the learning levels of the cognitive, affective, or psychomotor domains described in Chapter 3. The  levels of cognitive learning include knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.  

For   the understanding   level,   an   objective could   be stated   as, “Describe how    perform   a compression   test   on   an   aircraft reciprocating  engine.” This   objective requires a learner   to   explain   how   to   do   a compression   test,   but not necessarily   perform   a compression   test 

 (application level). Further, the learner would not be expected to compare the results of compression tests on different engines 

 (application level), design a compression test for a different type of engine (correlation level), or interpret the results of the  compression test (correlation level). A general level-of-learning objective is a good starting point for developing a test because it  defines the scope of the learning task.  

# List Indicators/Samples of Desired Behaviors  

The second step is to list the indicators or samples of behavior that give the best indication of the achievement of the objective. The  instructor selects behaviors that can be measured and which give the best evidence of learning. For example, if the instructor expects  the learner to display the understanding level of learning on compression testing, some of the specific test question answers should  describe appropriate tools and equipment, the proper equipment setup, appropriate safety procedures, and the steps used to obtain  compression readings. The overall test must be comprehensive enough to give a true representation of the learning to be measured. It  is not usually feasible to measure every aspect of a level of learning objective, but by carefully choosing samples of behavior, the  instructor can obtain adequate evidence of learning.  

# Establish Criterion Objectives  

The next step in the test development process is to define criterion (performance-based) objectives. In addition to the behavior  expected, criterion objectives state the conditions under which the behavior is to be performed, and the criteria that must be met. If  the instructor developed performance-based objectives during the creation of lesson plans, criterion objectives have already been  formulated. The criterion objective provides the framework for developing the test items used to measure the level of learning  objectives. In the compression test example, a criterion objective to measure the understanding level of learning might be stated as,  “The learner   will demonstrate understanding   of   compression   test   procedures for   reciprocating   aircraft engines by   completing   a   quiz  with   a minimum   passing   score of   70   percent.”  

# Develop Criterion-Referenced Assessment Items  

The last step is to develop criterion-referenced assessment items. The development of written test questions is covered in the  reference section. While developing written test questions, the instructor should attempt to measure the behaviors described in the  criterion objective(s). The questions in the exam for the compression test example should cover all of the areas necessary to give  evidence of understanding the procedure. The results of the test (questions missed) identify areas that were not adequately covered.  

Performance-based objectives serve as a reference for the development of test items. If the test is the pre-solo knowledge test, the  objectives are for the learner to understand the regulations, the local area, the aircraft type, and the procedures to be used. The test  should   measure the learner’s   knowledge in   these specific areas.   Individual instructors   should   develop   their   own   tests   to   measure the  progress of their learners. If the test is to measure the readiness of a learner to take a knowledge test, it should be based on the  objectives of all the lessons the learner has received.  

Aviation training also involves performance tests for maneuvers or procedures. The flight instructor does not administer the practical  test for a pilot certificate, nor does the aviation maintenance instructor administer the oral and practical exam for certification as an  aviation maintenance technician (AMT). However, aviation instructors do get involved with the same skill or performance testing that  is measured in these tests. Performance testing is desirable for evaluating training that involves an operation, a procedure, or a  process. The job of the instructor is to prepare the learner to take these tests. Therefore, each element of the practical test should be  evaluated prior to sending an applicant for the practical exam.  

Practical tests for maintenance technicians and pilots are criterion-referenced tests. The practical tests, defined in the Airman  Certification Standards and Practical Test Standards (ACS/PTS), are criterion referenced because the objective is for all successful  applicants to meet the high standards of knowledge, skill, and safety required by the regulations. The purpose of the ACS/PTS is to  delineate the standards by which FAA inspectors, designated pilot examiners (DPEs), and designated maintenance examiners (DMEs)  conduct tests for ratings and certificates. The standards reflect the requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14  CFR) parts 61, 65, 91, and other FAA publications, including the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and pertinent advisory  circulars and handbooks.  

The objectives in the ACS/PTS ensure the certification of pilots and maintenance technicians at a high level of performance and  proficiency, consistent with safety. The ACS/PTS for aeronautical certificates and ratings include areas of operation and tasks that  reflect the requirements of the FAA publications mentioned above. Areas of operation define phases of the practical test arranged in a  logical sequence within each standard. They usually begin with preflight preparation and end with postflight procedures. Tasks are  titles of knowledge areas, flight procedures, or maneuvers appropriate to an area of operation. Included are references to the  applicable regulations or publications. Private pilot applicants are evaluated in all tasks of each area of operation. Flight instructor  applicants are evaluated on one or more tasks in each area of operation. In addition, certain tasks are required to be covered and are  identified by notes immediately following the area of operation titles.  

Since evaluators may cover every task in the ACS/PTS on the practical test, the instructor should evaluate all of the tasks before  recommending the maintenance technician or pilot applicant for the practical test. While this evaluation is not necessarily formal, it  should adhere to criterion-referenced testing.  

# Critiques and Oral Assessments  

Used in conjunction with either traditional or authentic assessment, the critique is an instructor-to-learner assessment. These methods  can also be used either individually, or in a classroom setting.  

The word critique sometimes has a negative connotation, and the instructor needs to avoid using this method as an opportunity to be  overly critical of learner performance. An effective critique considers good as well as bad performance, the individual parts,  relationships of the individual parts, and the overall performance. A critique can and usually should be as varied in content as the  performance being evaluated.  

A   critique may   be oral,   written,   or   both.   It should   come immediately   after   a learner’s   performance,   while the details of   the  performance are easy to recall. An instructor may critique any activity a learner performs or practices to improve skill, proficiency,  and learning. A critique may be conducted privately or before the entire class. A critique presented before the entire class can be  beneficial to every learner in the classroom, as well as to the learner who performed the exercise or assignment. In this case, however,  the instructor should avoid embarrassing the learner in front of the class.  

There are several useful ways to conduct a critique.  

# Instructor/Learner Critique  

The instructor leads a group discussion in an instructor/learner critique in which members of the class are invited to offer criticism of  a performance. This method should be controlled carefully and directed with a clear purpose. It should be organized, and not allowed  to degenerate into a random free-for-all.  

# Learner-Led Critique  

The instructor asks a learner to lead the assessment in a learner-led critique. The instructor can specify the pattern of organization and  the techniques or can leave it to the discretion of the chosen leader. Because of the inexperience of the participants in the lesson area,  learner-led assessments may not be efficient, but they can generate learner interest and learning.  

# Small Group Critique  

For the small group critique, the class is divided into small groups, each assigned a specific area to analyze. Each group presents its  findings to the class. It is desirable for the instructor to furnish the criteria and guidelines. The combined reports from the groups can  result in a comprehensive assessment.  

# Individual Learner Critique by Another Learner  

The instructor may require another learner to present the entire assessment. A variation is for the instructor to ask a number of  learners questions about the manner and quality of performance. Discussion of the performance and of the assessment can often allow  the group to accept more ownership of the ideas expressed. As with all assessments incorporating learner participation, it is important  that the instructor maintain firm control over the process.  

# Self-Critique  

A learner critiques personal performance in a self-critique. Like all other methods, a self-critique receives control and supervision  from the instructor.  

# Written Critique  

A written critique has three advantages. First, the instructor can devote more time and thought to it than to an oral assessment in the  classroom. Second, learners can keep written assessments and refer to them whenever they wish. Third, when the instructor asks all  learners to write an assessment of a performance, the learner-performer has the permanent record of the suggestions,  recommendations, and opinions of all the other learners. The disadvantage of a written assessment is that other members of the class  do not benefit.  

Whatever the type of critique, the instructor should resolve disagreements and correct erroneous impressions. The instructor also  makes allowances   for   the learners’   relative inexperience.   Normally,   the instructor   should   reserve time at the end   of   the learner  assessment to cover those areas that might have been omitted, not emphasized sufficiently, or considered worth repeating.  

# Oral Assessment  

The most common means of assessment is direct or indirect oral questioning of learners by the instructor. Questions may be loosely  classified as fact questions and HOTS questions. The answer to a fact question is based on memory or recall. This type of question  usually concerns who, what, when, and where. HOTS questions involve why or how and require the learner to combine knowledge of  facts with an ability to analyze situations, solve problems, and arrive at conclusions.  

Proper quizzing by the instructor can have a number of desirable results, such as:  

1.   Reveals the effectiveness of the instructor’s training methods   2.   Checks learner retention of what has been learned  3.   Reviews material already presented to the learner  4.   Can be used to retain learner interest and stimulate thinking  5.   Emphasizes the important points of training  6.   Identifies points that need more emphasis  7.   Checks comprehension of what has been learned  8.   Promotes active learner participation, which is important to effective learning  

# Characteristics of Effective Questions  

The instructor should devise and write pertinent questions in advance. One method is to place them in the lesson plan. Prepared  questions merely serve as a framework, and as the lesson progresses, should be supplemented by such impromptu questions as the  instructor considers appropriate. Objective questions have only one correct answer, while the answer to an open-ended HOTS  question can be expressed in a variety of possible solutions.  

To be effective, questions must:  

1.   Apply to the subject of instruction.  2.   Be brief and concise, but also clear and definite.  3.   Be adapted to the ability, experience, and stage of training of the learners.  4.   Center on only one idea (limited to who, what, when, where, how, or why, not a combination).  5.   Present a challenge to the learners.  

# Types of Questions to Avoid  

Effective quizzing   does not include yes/no   questions   such   as “Do   you   understand?” or   “Do   you   have any   questions?” Instructors   should also avoid the following types of questions:  

⦁  Puzzle—“What is the first action you should take if a conventional gear airplane with a weak right brake is      swerving left in a right crosswind during a full flap, power-on wheel landing?”   ⦁  Oversize—“What do you do before beginning an engine overhaul?”   ⦁  Toss-up—“In an emergency, should you squawk 7700 or pick a landing spot?”   ⦁  Bewilderment—“In reading the altimeter—you know you set a sensitive altimeter for the nearest station  pressure—if you take temperature into account, as when flying from a cold air mass through a warm front,  what precaution should you take when in a mountainous area?”   ⦁  Trick questions—these questions cause the learners to develop the feeling that they are engaged in a battle  of wits with the instructor, and the whole significance of the subject of the instruction involved is lost. An  example of a trick question would be one in which the response options are 1, 2, 3, and 4, but they are  placed in the following form:  

A. 4  B. 3  C. 2  D. 1  

⦁  Irrelevant questions—diversions that introduce only unrelated facts and thoughts and slow the learner’s      progress. Questions unrelated to the test topics are not helpful in evaluating the learner’s knowledge of the      subject at hand. An example of an irrelevant question would be to ask a question about tire inflation during a  test on the timing of magnetos.  

# Answering Learner Questions  

Tips for responding effectively to learner questions, especially in a classroom setting:  

1. Be sure that you clearly understand the question before attempting to answer.  2. Display   interest in   the learner’s   question   and   frame an   answer   that is   as direct and   accurate as possible. 3.  After responding, determine whether or not the learner is satisfied with the answer.  

Sometimes it is unwise to introduce considerations more complicated or advanced than necessary to completely answer a learner’s   question at the current point in training. In this case, the instructor should carefully explain to the learner that the question was good  and pertinent, but that a detailed answer would, at this time, unnecessarily complicate the learning tasks. The instructor should invite  the learner to reintroduce the question later at the appropriate point in training.  

Occasionally, a learner asks a question that the instructor cannot answer. In such cases, the instructor should freely admit not knowing  the answer, but should promise to get the answer or, if practicable, offer to help the learner look it up in available references.  

# Scenario-Based Training  

Since flying has become more complex, the focus of training needs to address pilot decision-making and risk management, a concept  the authors call Single Pilot Resource Management (SRM). Since SRM training requires practicing the decision-making process in  real time and in real situations, a new form of GA training that goes beyond the traditional task and maneuver-based training is  recommended. The FITS program emphasizes combining traditional task and maneuver training with Scenario Based Training (SBT)  to teach the advanced pilot judgment and risk management skills required in the SRM environment.  

In many respects, scenario-based training is not a new concept. Experienced  f light  i nstructors have been using scenarios to teach cross  country operations, emergency procedures, and other flight skills for years. Scenario-based training puts the learner pilot into the  normal cross-country environment much earlier than traditional flight training programs. The goal is to begin training the pilot,  through meaningful repetition, how to gather information and make informed and timely decisions. We routinely refer to this  process as “experience.” Scenario-based learning does not preclude traditional maneuver-based training. Rather, flight maneuvers are  integrated into the flight scenarios and conducted, as they would occur in the real world. Those maneuvers requiring repetition may  still be taught during concentrated settings. However, once they are learned, they are then integrated into realistic flight situations.  

The  f light  i nstructor is crucial to the implementation of a scenario-based training program. In this capacity, an instructor serves in the  learning environment as an advisor and guide for the learner. The duties, responsibilities, and authority of the  f light  i nstructor include  the following:  

⦁  Orient new learners to the scenario-based training system.  ⦁  Help the learner become a confident planner and in-flight manager of each flight and a critical evaluator of      their own performance.  ⦁  Help the learner understand the knowledge requirements present in real world applications.  ⦁  Diagnose learning difficulties and help the individual overcome them.  ⦁  Be able to evaluate learner progress and maintain appropriate records.  ⦁  Provide continuous review of learning.  

The  f light  i nstructor is the key to success, and different instructional techniques are required for successful SBT. Remembering that  the learning objective is for the learner to be more ready to exercise sound judgment and make good decisions; the  f light  i nstructor  turns the responsibility for planning and execution of the flight over to the learner as soon as possible. The  f light  i nstructor will  continue to demonstrate and instruct skill maneuvers in the traditional manner, however, when the learner begins to make decisions  the  f light  i nstructor should revert to the role of mentor and/or learning facilitator.  

Each situation a learner faces may not have one right, and one wrong answer. Instead, learners will encounter situations in training  that may have several "good" outcomes as well as the potential for some "poor" ones. While the  f light  i nstructor should understand in  advance which outcomes are positive or negative, the instructor allows the learner to make both good and poor decisions. This does  not mean that the learner should be allowed to make an unsafe decision or commit an unsafe act. However, it does allow the learner to  make decisions that fit their experience level and result in positive outcomes.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter described the methods and techniques aviation instructors use to assess learner progress. A well-designed and timely  assessment defines what is worth knowing, enhances motivation, and improves learning. Today’s learners want to know the criteria  by which they are assessed, and they want practical and specif i c feedback. Aviation instructors familiar with different  types of assessments know how and when to use them to promote a productive learning environment .  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 7: Planning Instructional Activity  

# Introduction  

Susan (learner) and Bill ( f light  i nstructor) are flying a lesson scenario which consists of a short cross-country leg to a local airport for  some practice landings followed by a return to the home airport located in Class C airspace. While practicing landings at the  nontowered airport, Susan notes that the ceiling is lowering, and the crosswind is beginning to increase. In his own mind, Bill is  convinced that they can practice landings for another 30 minutes to an hour and still return to home base. However, instead of  telling Susan this, while taxiing back after a full stop landing, he first asks her several questions.  

⦁  Has the flight situation changed since they left the home field?  ⦁  What does she think of the weather situation?   $\circ$    How can we gain more information?  - Check with Flight Service by cell phone or on the radio?  - Stop at the local Fixed Based Operator (FBO) and call back to the home FBO to check on weather?  ⦁  Are there other issues?  - Fuel?  - Schedule?  

Susan decides that she would be more comfortable returning to the home airport and practicing landings there to stay out of the  weather. Although not his plan, it is a good plan based on accurate situational awareness and good risk management skills, so Bill  agrees. Susan is now beginning to gain confidence by practicing her judgment and decision-making skills. In the postflight critique,  Susan leads a discussion of this and other decisions she has made in order to learn more about under s tanding hazards and mitigating  risk.  

In the past, the aviation instructor was a capable pilot or aviation technician with a general understanding of basic teaching methods  and   techniques. Currently,   the Federal Aviation   Administration   (FAA)   places   greater   emphasis   on   the instructor’s   role and   skill as a  teacher and mentor. The instructor should understand how to create and use lesson objectives and lesson plans. The instructor should  know how to assess learning and motivate learners through proper fee d back and by setting a good example. The learning that  takes place is a direct result of the instructor's active lesson preparation, delivery, observation, and assessment.  

Historically, aviation instruction focused on the performance of specific procedures and/or maneuvers, and measured learning with  objective standards.   Changing   technology   and   innovations    learning   provide today’s   aviation   instructors   with   the opportunity to use  new methods and teach to new standards. One of these methods, introduced in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process, is scenario-based  training   (SBT).   While   SBT    an   integral   component   of   today’s   aviation   training,   the   instructor    crucial   to   its   implementation. By  emphasizing SBT, the instructor functions in the learning environment as an advisor and guide for the learner.  

This chapter reviews the planning required by the professional aviation instructor as it relates to four key topics—course of training,  blocks of learning, training syllabus, and lesson plans. It also explains how to integrate SBT, aeronautical decision-making (ADM),  and risk management into the aviation training lesson.  

# Course of Training  

Whatever the method of teaching, the key to developing well-planned and organized aviation instruction includes using lesson plans  and a training syllabus that meet all regulatory certification requirements. Much of the basic planning necessary for the flight  instructor and maintenance instructor is provided by the knowledge and proficiency requirements published in Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) parts 61 and 65, approved school syllabi, and the various texts, manuals, and training courses  available.  

As discussed in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process, a course of training is a series of studies leading to attainment of a specific goal  such as a certificate of completion, graduation, or an academic degree. An instructor plans instructional content around the course of  training by determining the objectives and standards, which in turn determine individual lesson plans, test items, and levels of  learning. For a complete discussion of these items, see Chapter 5.  

# Blocks of Learning  

After the overall training objectives have been established, the next step is the identification of the blocks of learning which constitute  the necessary parts of the total objective. Just as in building a pyramid, some blocks are submerged in the structure and never appear  on the surface, but each is an integral and necessary part of the structure. Thus, the various blocks are not isolated subjects, but  essential parts of the whole. During the process of identifying the blocks of learning to be assembled for the proposed training  activity, the instructor should also examine each block to ensure it is an integral part of the structure. Extraneous blocks of instruction  are expensive frills, especially in-flight instruction, and detract from, rather than assist in, the completion of the final objective.  

While determining the overall training objectives is a necessary first step in the planning process, early identification of the  foundation blocks of learning is also essential. Training for any such complicated and involved task as piloting or maintaining an  aircraft requires the development and assembly of many segments or blocks of learning in their proper relationships. In this way, a  learner can master the segments or blocks individually and can progressively combine these with other related segments until their  sum meets the overall training objectives.  

The blocks of learning identified during the planning and management of a training activity should be fairly consistent in scope. They  should represent units of learning which can be measured and evaluated—not a sequence of periods of instruction. For example, the  flight training of a private pilot might be divided into the following major blocks: achievement of the knowledge and skills necessary  for solo, the knowledge and skills necessary for solo cross-country flight, and the knowledge and skills appropriate for obtaining a  private pilot certificate.  [Figure 7-1]  

![](images/d19c40b9f8dcfc0e57ef9c26283e9a8c91de51127c2bc4690e565bf4cb969045.jpg)  
Figure 7-1.  The presolo stage or phase of private pilot training is comprised of several basic building blocks. These blocks of  learning, which should include coordinated ground and flight training, lead up to the first solo.  

Use of the building block approach provides the learner with a boost in self-confidence. This normally occurs each time a block is  completed.   Otherwise,   an   overall goal,   such   as earning   a mechanic’s   certificate,   may   seem   unobtainable.   If   the larger   blocks   are  broken down into smaller blocks of instruction, each on its own is more manageable. Humans learn from the simple to the complex.  For example, a learner pilot should understand and master the technique of a normal landing prior to being introduced to short-field  and soft-field landings. A helicopter pilot should be proficient in running landings before the instructor introduces a no hydraulics  approach and landing.  

By   becoming   familiar   with   the   learner’s   aviation   background,   an   instructor   can   plan   the   sequence   of   instruction   blocks.   Does   the  applicant have previous aeronautical experience or possess a pilot certificate in another category? This information will help the  instructor design appropriate training blocks. For example, if the learner is a helicopter pilot who is transitioning to an airplane, he or  she will understand speed control, but not necessarily know how to achieve it in an airplane. The instructor can plan blocks of  instruction that build on what the learner already knows.  

# Training Syllabus  

Instructors need a practical guide to help them make sure the training is accomplished in a logical sequence and that all of the  requirements are completed and properly documented. A well organized, comprehensive syllabus can fulfill these needs.  

# Syllabus Format and Content  

The format and organization of the syllabus may vary, but it always should be in the form of an abstract or digest of the course of  training. It should contain blocks of learning to be completed in the most efficient order. Since a syllabus is intended to be a summary  of a course of training, it should be fairly brief, yet comprehensive enough to cover essential information. This information is usually  presented in an outline format with lesson-by-lesson coverage. Some syllabi include tables to show recommended training time for  each lesson, as well as the overall minimum time requirements.  [Figure 7-2]  

While many instructors may develop their own training syllabi, there are many well-designed commercial products that may be used.  These are found in various training manuals, approved school syllabi, and other publications available from industry.  

Syllabi developed for approved flight schools contain specific information that is outlined in 14 CFR parts 141 and 142. In contrast,  syllabi designed for training in other than approved schools may not provide certain details such as enrollment prerequisites, planned  completion times, and descriptions of checks and tests to measure learner accomplishments for each stage of training.  

Since effective training relies on organized blocks of learning, all syllabi should stress well-defined objectives and standards for each  lesson. Appropriate objectives and standards should be established for the overall course, the separate ground and flight segments,  and for each stage of training. Other details may be added to a syllabus in order to explain how to use it and describe the pertinent  training and reference materials. Examples of the training and reference materials include textbooks, websites, video, compact dis c s,  exams, briefings, and instructional guides.  

# How to Use a Training Syllabus  

Any practical training syllabus needs to be flexible and should be used primarily as a guide. Under 14 CFR part 61, the order of  training can and should be altered to suit the progress of the learner and the demands of special circumstances. For example, previous  experience or different rates of learning often require some alteration or repetition to fit individual learners. The syllabus should also  be flexible enough so it can be adapted to weather variations, aircraft availability, and scheduling changes without disrupting the  teaching process or completely suspending training.  

When departing from the order prescribed by the syllabus, however, it is the responsibility of the instructor to consider how the  relationships of the blocks of learning are affected. For example, if the learner is having a difficult time with normal approaches and  landings, the instructor might decide to delay adding short-field landings, which were originally to be the next step in his block of  instruction. To prevent the learner from becoming frustrated with his or her poor landing technique, the instructor may choose to  review the block on slow flight, which offers the learner a chance to do well and regain confidence. This exercise also builds the skills  necessary for the learner to master approaches and normal landings.  

Each approved training course provided by a certificated aviation school should be conducted in accordance with a training syllabus  specifically approved by the FAA. At certificated schools, the syllabus is a key part of the training course outline. The instructional  facilities, airport, aircraft, and instructor personnel support the course of training specified in the syllabus. Compliance with the  appropriate, approved syllabus is a condition for graduation from such courses. Therefore, effective use of a syllabus necessitates  that it be referred to throughout the entire course of training. Both the instructor and the learner should have a copy of the approved  syllabus. However, as previously mentioned, adherence to a syllabus should not be so stringent that it becomes inflexible or  unchangeable. It should be flexible enough to adapt to the special needs of individual learners.  

Ground training lessons and classroom lectures concentrate on the cognitive domain of learning. A typical lesson might include  defining, labeling, or listing what the learner understands so far. Many of the knowledge areas are directly or indirectly concerned  with safety, ADM, and judgment. Since these subjects are associated with the affective domain of learning (emotion), instructors who  find a way to stress safety, ADM, and judgment, along with the traditional aviation subjects, can favorably influence a learner’s     attitude, beliefs, and values.

Figure 7-2.  This excerpt of a ground lesson shows a unit of ground instruction. In this example, neither the time nor the number of  ground training periods to be devoted to the lesson is specified. The lesson should include three parts—objective, content, and  completion standards .  

Flight training lessons or aviation technical lab sessions also include knowledge areas, but they generally emphasize the psychomotor  domain   of   learning   because the learner    “doing” something.   The lesson   plan   shown   in   Figure 7-3  shows the main elements of a  ground   lesson   for   a flight learner.   The affective domain   of   learning   is   also   important in   this   type of   training; a learner’s   attitude  toward safety, ADM, and judgment, should be a major concern of the instructor.

The flight training syllabus should include Risk Management instruction unique to each stage, phase, or training element to help the  learner   identify   the   risks   involved   and   employ   strategies   to   mitigate   them.   Throughout   the   learner’s   training   scenarios   the instructor  should include increasingly more subtle risks so that the learner becomes more skilled in identifying them and able to  develop effective mitigation strategies. The aviation technician syllabus should also emphasize what constitutes unsafe practices, such  as  the ease of introducing foreign object damage (FOD) to an aircraft when the location of tools is not monitored.  

A syllabus may include several other items that add to or clarify the objective, content, or standards. A lesson may specify the  recommended class time, reference or study materials, recommended sequence of training, and study assignment for the next lesson.  Both ground and flight lessons may have explanatory information notes added to specific lessons.  [Figure 7-4]  

#  

While a syllabus is designed to provide a road map showing how to accomplish the overall objective of a course of training, it may be  useful for other purposes. As already mentioned, it can be used as a checklist to ensure that required training has successfully been  completed. Thus, a syllabus can be an effective tool for recordkeeping. Enhanced syllabi, which also are designed for recordkeeping,  can be very beneficial to the independent instructor.  

This recordkeeping function is usually facilitated by boxes or blank spaces adjacent to the knowledge areas, procedures, or  maneuvers in a lesson. Most syllabi introduce each procedure or maneuver in one lesson and review them in subsequent lessons.  Some syllabi also include provisions for grading learner performance and recording both ground and flight training time. Accurate  recordkeeping is necessary to keep both the learner and the instructor informed on the status of training. These records also serve as a  basis for endorsements and recommendations for knowledge and practical tests. Some training syllabi or records may include coded  numbers   or   letters   for   other   instructors    record   their   evaluation   of   a learner’s   progress   and   knowledge or   skill level.   [Figure 7-5]

Another benefit of using a syllabus is that it helps in the development of lesson plans. A well-constructed syllabus already contains  much of the essential information that is required in a lesson plan, including objectives, content, and completion standards.  

# Lesson Plans  

A lesson plan is an organized outline for a single instructional period. It is a necessary guide for the instructor because it tells what to  do, in what order to do it, and what procedure to use in teaching the material of a lesson. Lesson plans should be prepared for each  training period and be developed to show specific knowledge and/or skills to be taught.  

A mental outline of a lesson is not a lesson plan. A lesson plan should be put into writing. Another instructor should be able to take  the lesson plan and know what to do in conducting the same period of instruction. Written out, the lesson plan can be analyzed for  adequacy and completeness.  

Lesson   plans   make excellent recordkeeping   forms   that can   become a permanent part of   a pilot’s   training   record.   They   can   be  formatted for the instructor to carry in the aircraft and include a checklist for indicating what portions of the lesson were completed,  date of   completion,   the flight instructor’s   signature,   and   time flown.   The lesson   plan   can   also   have a notation   section   for   flight  instructor comments.  

A training folder for each learner helps an instructor keep all pertinent data in one place. The folder should include items such  as lesson plans, training requirements, flight or ground instruction received, 14 CFR part 61 requirements met, solo endorsements,  and any other training information. Many training records are now recorded and maintained electronically. These records should be  kept for at least 3 years. Good recordkeeping also provides each instructor with the number of learners he or she has trained,  which is helpful information for an instructor who needs to renew his or her certificate.  

# Purpose of the Lesson Plan  

Lesson plans are designed to assure that each learner receives the best possible instruction under the existing conditions. Lesson plans  help instructors keep a constant check on their own activity, as well as that of their learners. The development of lesson plans  by instructors signifies, in effect, that they have taught the lessons to themselves prior to attempting to teach the lessons to learners.  An adequate lesson plan, when properly used, should:  

⦁  Assure a wise selection of material and the elimination of unimportant details.  ⦁  Make certain that due consideration is given to each part of the lesson.  ⦁  Aid the instructor in presenting the material in a suitable sequence for efficient learning.  ⦁  Provide an outline of the teaching procedure to be used.  ⦁  Serve as a means of relating the lesson to the objectives of the course of training.  ⦁  Give the inexperienced instructor confidence.  ⦁  Promote uniformity of instruction regardless of the instructor or the date on which the lesson is given.  

# Characteristics of a Well-Planned Lesson  

The quality of planning affects the quality of results. Successful professionals understand that the price of excellence is hard work and  thorough preparation. The effective instructor realizes that the time and energy spent in planning and preparing each lesson is well  worth the effort in the long run.  

A complete cycle of planning usually includes several steps. After the objective is determined, the instructor researches the subject as  it is defined by the objective. Once the research is complete, the instructor determines the method of instruction and identifies a useful  lesson planning format. The decision of how to organize the lesson and the selection of suitable support material come next. The final  steps include assembling training aids and writing the lesson plan outline. One technique for writing the lesson plan outline is to  prepare the beginning and ending first. Then, complete the outline and revise as required. A lesson plan should be a working  document that can and should be revised as changes occur or are needed.  

The following are some of the important characteristics that should be reflected in all well-planned lessons.  

Unity—each lesson should be a unified segment of instruction. A lesson is concerned with certain limited objectives, which are stated  in terms of desired learning outcomes. All teaching procedures and materials should be selected to attain these objectives.  

Content—each lesson should contain new material. However, the new facts, principles, procedures, or skills should be related to the  lesson previously presented. A short review of earlier lessons is usually necessary, particularly in-flight training.  

Scope—each lesson should be reasonable in scope. A person can master only a few principles or skills at a time, the number  depending on complexity. Presenting too much material in a lesson results in confusion; presenting too little material results in  inefficiency.  

Practicality—each lesson should be planned in terms of the conditions under which the training is to be conducted. Lesson plans  conducted in an airplane or ground trainer will differ from those conducted in a classroom. Also, the kinds and quantities of  instructional aids available have a great influence on lesson planning and instructional procedures.  

Flexibility—although the lesson plan provides an outline and sequence for the training to be conducted, a degree of flexibility should  be incorporated. For example, the outline of content may include blank spaces for add-on material, if required.  

Relation to course of training—each lesson should be planned and taught so that its relation to the course objectives is clear to each  learner. For example, a lesson on short-field takeoffs and landings should be related to both the certification and safety objectives of  the course of training.  

Instructional steps—every lesson, when adequately developed, falls logically into the four steps of the teaching process: preparation,  presentation, application, and review and evaluation.  

# How to Use a Lesson Plan Properly  

Be familiar with the lesson plan. The instructor should study each step of the plan and should be thoroughly familiar with as much  information related to the subject as possible.  

Use the lesson plan as a guide. The lesson plan is an outline for conducting an instructional period. It assures that pertinent materials  are at hand and that the presentation is accomplished with order and unity. Having a plan prevents the instructor from getting off  track, omitting essential points, and introducing irrelevant material. Learners have a right to expect an instructor to give the same  attention to teaching that they give to learning. The most certain means of achieving teaching success is to have a carefully reviewed  lesson plan.  

Adapt the lesson plan to the class or learner. In teaching a class, the instructor may find that the procedures outlined in the lesson plan  are not leading to the desired results. In this situation, the instructor should change the approach. There is no certain way of predicting  the reactions of different groups of learners. An approach that has been successful with one group may not be equally successful with  another.  

A lesson plan for an instructional flight period should be appropriate to the background, flight experience, and ability of the particular  learner.   A   lesson   plan   may   have to   be modified   considerably   during   flight, due to   deficiencies in   the learner’s   knowledge or   poor  mastery of elements essential to the effective completion of the lesson. In some cases, the entire lesson plan may have to be  abandoned in favor of review.  

Revise the lesson plan periodically. After a lesson plan has been prepared for a training period, a continuous revision may be  necessary. This is true for a number of reasons such as availability or non-availability of instructional aids, changes in regulations, or  new manuals and textbooks.  

# Lesson Plan Formats  

The format and style of a lesson plan depends on several factors. Certainly, the subject matter helps determine how a lesson is  presented and what teaching method is used. Individual lesson plans may be quite simple for one-on-one training, or they may be  elaborate and complicated for large, structured classroom lessons. Preferably, each lesson should have somewhat limited objectives  that are achievable within a reasonable period of time. This principle should apply to both ground and flight training. However, as  previously noted, aviation training is not simple. It involves all three domains of learning, and the objectives usually include the  higher levels of learning, at least at the application level.  

In spite of need for varied subject coverage, diverse teaching methods, and relatively high-level learning objectives, most aviation  lesson plans have the common characteristics already discussed. All should include objectives, content to support the objectives, and  completion standards. Various authorities often divide the main headings into several subheadings; terminology, even for the main  headings, varies extensively. For example, completion standards may be called assessment, review and feedback, performance  evaluation, or some other related term.  

Commercially developed lesson plans are acceptable for most training situations, including use by flight instructor applicants during  their practical tests. However, all instructors should recognize that even well-designed preprinted lesson plans may need to be  modified. Therefore, instructors are encouraged to use creativity when adapting preprinted lesson plans or when developing their own  lesson plans for specific learners or training circumstances.  

In the traditional lesson plan illustrated by  Figure 7-6,  the objective is   “The learner   will learn    control for   wind   drift.”   According    the plan, the instructor reviews topics already covered including heading, speed, angle of bank, altitude, terrain, and wind direction  plus velocity. This explanation is followed by a demonstration and repeated practice of a specific flight maneuver, such as turns  around a point or S-turns across the road until the maneuver can be consistently accomplished in a safe and effective manner within a  specified limit of heading, altitude, and airspeed. At the end of this lesson, the learner is only capable of practicing the maneuver with  assistance from the instructor.  

The traditional type of training lesson plan with its focus on the task and maneuver or procedure continues to meet many aviation  learning requirements, but as discussed earlier in the chapter, it is being augmented by more realistic and fluid forms of  problem-based learning such as SBT. For the  flight instructor , this type of training does not preclude traditional maneuver-based  training. Rather, flight maneuvers are integrated into the flight scenarios and conducted as they would occur in the real world.  Those maneuvers requiring repetition are still taught during concentrated settings; once learned, they are then integrated into realistic  flight situations.  

For the aviation technician instructor, SBT enhances traditional classroom instruction. By integrating SBT into the lesson, learners  are required to deal with problems they will encounter in the real world.

Figure 7-6.  Example of a traditional training lesson plan.  

# Scenario-Based Training (SBT)  

Improper pilot decisions cause a significant percentage of all accidents and the majority of fatal accidents in light single- and twin- engine aircraft. The goal of SBT is to challenge the learner or transitioning pilot with a variety of flight scenarios to improve  decision-making skills. These scenarios train the pilot to manage the resources available in the flight deck, consider hazards, exercise  sound judgment, and make timely decisions that promote safety.  

As defined in Chapter 5, SBT is a training method that uses a highly structured script of real world experiences to address aviation  training objectives in an operational environment. Such training can include initial training, transition training, upgrade training,  recurrent training, and special training. Since humans develop cognitive skills through active interaction with the world, an effective  aviation instructor uses the maneuver- or procedure-based approach but presents the objectives in a scenario situation.  

Although some  flight instructors   have used the SBT approach as a teaching method for many years, the current emphasis on  SBT in aviation training reflects education research that shows learning is more effective when participants are actively  involved in the learning process.  

Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM) requires the learner or transitioning pilot to practice the decision-making process in real- world situations, It combines traditional task and maneuver-based training with SBT to enhance ADM, risk management, and SRM  skills without compromising basic aeronautical skills. Instead of training pilots to pass practical tests, this program focuses on  expertly managed real-world challenges.  

# Duties, Responsibilities, and Authority of the Aviation Instructor  

The duties, responsibilities, and authority of the aviation instructor include the following:  

1.   Orient new learners to the SBT approach.  2.   Help the learner become a confident planner and a critical self-evaluator of performance.  3.   Help the learner understand the knowledge requirements present in real world applications.  4.   Diagnose learning difficulties and help the individual overcome them.  5.   Evaluate learner progress and maintain appropriate records.  6.   Provide continuous review of learning.  

The aviation instructor is the key to the success of SBT. Remember, the overall learning objective is for the learner to be ready to  exercise sound judgment and make good decisions. For example, the flight instructor should be ready to turn the responsibility for  planning and execution of the flight over to the learner as soon as possible. The flight instructor continues to demonstrate and instruct  skill maneuvers in the traditional manner; but, when the learner begins to make decisions, the flight instructor should revert to the role  of mentor and learning facilitator.  

# SBT Lesson Plan  

The SBT lesson plan differs from the traditional lesson plan.  [Figure 7-7]  In this example, the instructor pilot tells the learner to plan  for arrival at a specific nontowered airport. The planning should take into consideration the possible wind conditions, arrival paths,  airport information and communication procedures, available runways, recommended traffic patterns, courses of action, and  preparation for unexpected situations. Upon arrival at the airport, the learner makes decisions (with guidance and feedback, as  necessary) to safely enter and fly the traffic pattern. This is followed by a discussion of what was done, why it was done, the  consequences, other possible courses of action, and how it applies to other airports. In contrast to the learner who trained under the  traditional lesson plan, the learner who trains under the SBT format is not only capable of a specific flight maneuver, he or she is now  capable of detailing a safe arrival at any nontowered airport in a variety of wind condition.  

# Pre-Scenario Planning  

For SBT instruction to be effective, it is vital that the aviation instructor and learner establish the following information:  

Flight scenario:  

⦁  Scenario destination(s)  ⦁  Desired learning outcomes  ⦁  Desired level of learner performance  ⦁  Possible inflight scenario changes  

Nonflight scenario:  

⦁  Narrative of the task goal  ⦁  Desired learning outcomes  ⦁  Desired level of learner performance  ⦁  Possible scenario changes  

![](images/4ffd708bc876e7a4c98011c0a1f6b2221948d36ef4ad09605971bc49fe47a95a.jpg)  
Figure 7-7.  SBT lesson plan.  

The aviation industry is moving from traditional knowledge-related learning outcomes to an emphasis on increased internalized  learning in which learners assess situations and react appropriately. Enhancement of     knowledge and understanding usually  accompanies a dynamic learning experience.  

Reality is the ultimate learning situation and SBT attempts to get as close as possible to this ideal. It addresses learning that occurs in  a context or situation. It is based on the concept of situated cognition, which is the idea that knowledge cannot be known and fully  understood independent of its context. In other words, humans learn better from realistic situations where they are counted on to  perform.  

For example, realistic cross-country flight scenarios planned and executed by the pilot in training with assistance from the flight  instructor begin the early development of flight deck management skills, situational awareness, and ADM. Continued engagement by  the learner in the planning, executing, and assessment of each scenario reinforces development throughout the training. It is important  to remember the learner is responsible for planning the flight scenario from a menu of short cross-country flights developed by the  training provider. While the flight instructor will certainly assist the learner in aircraft performance data, weight and balance, and  general aircraft layout prior to the first lesson, the sooner the learner assumes these responsibilities, the better the learning  environment. The scenario descriptions offered in the FAA generic syllabi are a starting point for the training provider. Scenarios can  be tailored for the local weather and terrain conditions and are most effective when they replicate the environment most likely  encountered by the learners.  

SBT is a compilation of basic learning theory, adult learning concepts, and the best of the traditional aviation training procedures.  Above all, it is about learning complex tasks in a realistic environment at a pace and in a structure the individual learner can  comprehend and process.  [Figure 7-8]  Good teaching techniques are still important, but only if they aid in learning. More detailed  information about SBT can be found at  www.faa.gov/training testing/training/fits/more/ .

# Single-Pilot Resource Management  

SRM is the art and science of managing all the resources (both on-board the aircraft and from outside sources) available to a single  pilot (prior and during flight) to ensure that the successful outcome of the flight is never in doubt.  

The emergence of very light jet (VLJ) aircraft may also affect air travel.  [Figure 7-9]  Central to their economic success is the concept  of single-pilot operations.   Since   the aircraft is   heavily   automated,   the pilot’s   workload   may   actually   be less   than   the current workload  in some high performance single-engine aircraft. This allows more time for the pilot to gather and analyze information about weather,  winds, landing conditions, fuel state, pilot physical condition, and passenger desires.  

![](images/ccf8189004cfaf11472ca4f0e96619e6b561e79eeae266dd3c876acf3f7a067e.jpg)  
Figure 7-9.  Very light jet aircraft in flight.  

However, unless the pilot is trained to manage all of these factors and to let the aircraft automation assist, the workload may be very  high. SRM training helps the pilot maintain situational awareness by managing the automation and associated aircraft control and  navigation tasks. This enables the pilot to accurately assess, manage risk, and make accurate and timely decisions. SBT enhances  SRM because SBT helps pilots learn how to gather information, analyze it, and make decisions.  

# Chapter Summary  

As indicated by this chapter, it is possible to develop well-planned and organized instruction by using a training syllabus and lesson  plans   that   meet   all regulatory   certification   requirements.   By   identifying   and   incorporating   “blocks   of   learning”   into   the   teaching of  objectives, the instructor can plan lessons that build on prior knowledge. Maneuver and/or procedure training coupled with SBT will  help the aviation instructor train professional aviators and technicians who are able to gather and analyze information to aid in making  good aeronautical decisions and decrease risk factors, leading to a successful flight or maintenance outcome.  

As this training program evolves and new resources are introduced, aviation instructors may access web-based documents such as  the generic transition syllabus at  www.faa.gov/ .  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 8: Aviation Instructor Responsibilities and Professionalism  

# Introduction  

Since learners look to aviation instructors as role models, it is important that instructors not only know how to teach, but that they  project a knowledgeable and professional image. This chapter addresses the responsibilities of aviation instructors as trainers and as  safety advocates. It explains how aviation instructors can enhance their professional image, and offers suggestions and sources of  information to assist in professional development.  

# Aviation Instructor Responsibilit i es  

The job of an aviation instructor is to transfer knowledge. Previous chapters have discussed how people learn, the teaching process,  and teaching methods. To summarize in brief, instructors help learners meet and exceed established standards. Instructors measure  learner performance against those standards and give positive reinforcement along the way.  [Figure 8-1]  

#  

# Helping Learners  

Learning should be an enjoyable experience. By making each lesson a pleasurable experience, the instructor helps the learner  maintain a high level of motivation. This does not mean the instructor sacrifices standards of performance to make things easy. The  learner experiences satisfaction by doing a good job or by meeting the challenge of a difficult task.  

The idea that people need to be led to learning by making it easy is a fallacy. Though learners might initially be drawn to less difficult  tasks, they ultimately devote more effort to activities that bring rewards. The use of standards, and measurement against standards, is  key to helping learners. Meeting standards holds its own satisfaction for learners. People want to feel capable; they are proud of the  successful achievement of difficult goals.  

Learning should be interesting. Knowing the objective of each period of instruction gives meaning and interest to the learner, as well  as the instructor. Not knowing lesson objectives often leads to confusion, disinterest, and uneasiness on the part of the learner.  

# Providing Adequate Instruction  

To   tailor   his   or   her   teaching   technique to   the learner,   the flight instructor   analyzes   the learner’s   personality,   thinking,   and ability. No  two learners are alike, and a particular method of instruction may not be equally effective for all learners. The instructor talks with a  learner at some length to learn about their background, interests, temperament, and way of thinking, and should be prepared to change  his or her methods of instruction as the learner advances through successive stages of training.  

An instructor who incorrectly analyzes a learner may find the instruction does not produce the desired results. For example, the  instructor at first thinks the individual is not a quick learner because that learner is quiet and reserved. Such a learner may fail to act at  the proper time due to lack of self-confidence, even though the situation is correctly understood. In this case, instruction is directed  toward developing learner self-confidence, rather than drill on flight fundamentals. In another case, too much criticism may  discourage a timid person, whereas brisk instruction may force a more diligent application to the learning task. A learner requiring  more time to learn also requires instructional methods that combine tact, keen perception, and delicate handling. If such a learner  receives too much help and encouragement, a feeling of incompetence may develop.  

For learners who exhibit slow progress due to discouragement or lack of confidence, instructors should assign more easily attained  goals. Before attempting a complex task, the instructor separates it into discrete elements, and the learner practices and becomes good  at each element. For example, instruction in S-turns may begin with consideration for headings only. Elements of altitude control,  drift correction, and coordination can be introduced one at a time. As the learner gains confidence and ability, goals are increased in  difficulty.  

Conversely, fast learners can also create challenges for the instructor. Because these learners make few mistakes, they may assume  that the correction of errors is unimportant. Overconfidence may result, which leads to faulty performance. For these learners, the  instructor constantly raises the standard of performance for each lesson, demanding greater effort. Individuals learn only if aware of  their errors, and better retention of skills exists for learners who focus their attention on an analysis of their performance. On the  other   hand,   deficiencies should   not be invented   solely   for   the learners’   benefit. Unfair   criticism   immediately   destroys   a learner's  confidence in the instructor.  

In some ways, an aviation instructor serves as a practical psychologist. As discussed in Chapters 2, Human Behavior, and 3, The  Learning Process, an instructor can meet this responsibility by becoming familiar and conversant in the fundamentals of instructing  and through a careful analysis of and continuing interest in learners.  

Most new instructors tend to adopt the teaching methods used by their own instructors or the methods by which they themselves learn  best. The fact that one has learned under a certain system of instruction does not mean that the best and most efficient learning  occurred. The new instructor needs to remain open-minded and seek other resources and information to develop enhanced teaching  ability.  

# Standards of Performance  

An aviation instructor is responsible for training an applicant to established standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and  maneuvers included in the tasks within each area of operation in the appropriate Airman Certification (ACS)/Airman Practical Test  Standards (PTS). It should be emphasized that the ACS/PTS book is a testing document, not a teaching document.  [Figure 8-2]  

![](images/b8a869cc58db320c54bd9eae9c25f3f5e689d518ce02155502a963c9d218ddff.jpg)  
Figure 8-2.  Acceptable standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and maneuvers are included in the appropriate Airman  Certification Standards (ACS)/Practical Test Standards (PTS).  

# Emphasizing the Positive  

The way instructors conduct themselves and the attitudes they display make an impression on learners. An aviation instructor's ability  to teach in a manner that gives learners a positive image of aviation contributes to the instructor's success.  [Figure 8-3]  

![](images/f22fb3bcad76c009314bbfb53927e3b928fec2c6aa7eb2726d989b98e1ddac01.jpg)  
Figure 8-3.  Learners learn more when instruction is presented in a positive and professional manner.  

Chapter  3 ,  The Learning Process , emphasized that a negative self-concept inhibits the perceptual process, that fear adversely  affects learner perceptions, that the feeling of being threatened limits the ability to perceive, and that negative motivation is not as  effective as positive motivation. Merely knowing about these factors is not enough. Instructors need to detect these factors in their  learners and strive to prevent negative feelings from undermining the instructional process.  

Consider how the following negative scenarios conducted during the first lesson might adversely influence and turn off a new learner  pilot who has limited or no aviation experience:  

⦁  An indoctrination in preflight procedures with emphasis on the critical precautions taken before every      flight because “…emergencies in   flight can   be caused   by   an   improper   preflight and   are often   disastrous.”   ⦁  Instruction and hands-on   training    the care taken    taxiing   an   airplane because “…if   you   go   too   fast, you     lose directional control of   the aircraft.”   ⦁  Introduction   and   demonstration   of   stalls,   because “… this    how   so   many   people lose their   lives in       airplanes.”   ⦁  Illustrating   and   demonstrating   forced   landings   during   the first lesson,   because “…one should   always   be       prepared    cope with   a rope break    a glider.”  

These new experiences might make the new learner wonder if learning to fly is a good idea.  

In contrast, consider a first flight lesson in which the preflight inspection is presented to familiarize the learner with the aircraft and its  components, and the flight is a perfectly normal one to a nearby airport, with return. Following the flight, the instructor can call the  learner’s   attention   to   the ease with   which   the trip   was made in   comparison   with   other   modes of   transportation,   and   the fact that no  critical incidents were encountered or expected.  

This does not mean stalls and emergency procedures should be omitted from training. It only illustrates the positive approach in  which the learner does not receive overwhelming information. Using a syllabus that considers the learner's ability to comprehend new  information means a foundation exists for that information. The introduction of emergency procedures after the learner has developed  an acquaintance with normal operations is less likely to be discouraging and frightening, or to inhibit learning by the imposition of  fear.  

Nothing in aviation that demands that learners suffer as part of their instruction. Every effort should be made to ensure instruction is  given under positive conditions that reinforce training. Instructors may provide flexible training and modify the method of instruction  when   learners   have difficulty   grasping   a task.   In   essence,   a learner’s   failure to   perform   often   results   from   an   instructor’s   inability to  transfer the required information.  

Emphasize the positive because positive instruction results in positive learning.  

# Minimizing Learner Frustration  

Minimizing   learner   frustrations    the classroom,   shop,   or   during   flight training    an   instructor’s   responsibility.   Instructors can encourage rather than discourage learning by following some basic rules.  

For example, lesson plans used as part of an organized curriculum help the learner pilot measure training progress. Since most pilots  don’t want to   be learners,   the ability   to   measure their   progress   or   “see   an   end   in   sight” reduces   frustration   and   increases pilot  motivation.  [Figure 8-4]  

#  

Motivate learners—more can be gained from wanting to learn than from being forced to learn. Too often, learners do not realize how  a particular lesson or course can help them reach an important goal. When learners can see the benefits and purpose of the lesson or  course, their enjoyment and their efforts increase.  

Keep learners informed—learners feel insecure when they do not know what is expected of them or what is going to happen to them.  Instructors can minimize feelings of insecurity by telling learners what is expected of them and what they can expect in return.  Instructors keep learners informed in various ways, including giving them an overview of the course, keeping them posted on their  progress, and giving them adequate notice of examinations, assignments, or other requirements.  

Approach learners as individuals—when instructors limit their thinking to the whole group without considering the individuals who  make up that group, their efforts are directed at an average personality that really fits no one. Each group has its own personality that  stems from the characteristics and interactions of its members. Each individual within the group has a unique personality.  

Give credit when due—when learners do something extremely well, they normally expect their abilities and efforts to be noticed.  Otherwise, they may become frustrated. Praise or credit from the instructor is usually ample reward and provides an incentive to do  even better. Praise pays dividends in learner effort and achievement when deserved, but when given too freely, it becomes valueless.  

Criticize constructively—although it is important to give praise and credit when deserved, it is equally important to identify mistakes  and failures. It does not help to tell learners they have made errors and not provide explanations. If a learner has made an earnest  effort but is told that the work is unsatisfactory, with no other explanation, frustration occurs. Errors cannot be corrected if they are  not identified, and if they are not identified, they will probably be perpetuated through faulty practice. On the other hand, if the  learner is briefed on the errors and is told how to correct them, progress can be made.  

Be consistent—learners want to please their instructor. This is the same desire that influences much of the behavior of subordinates  toward their superiors in industry and business. Naturally, learners have a keen interest in knowing what is required to please the  instructor. If the same thing is acceptable one day and unacceptable the next, the learner becomes confused. The instructor’s  philosophy and actions need to be consistent.  

Admit errors—who expects an instructor to be perfect? The instructor can win the respect of learners by honestly acknowledging  mistakes. If the instructor tries to cover up or bluff, learners sense it quickly. Such behavior tends to destroy learner confidence in the  instructor. If in doubt about something, the instructor should admit it.  

# Flight Instructor Responsibilities  

Learning to fly should provide learners with an opportunity for exploration and experimentation. It should be a habit-building period  during which learners devote their attention, memory, and judgment to the development of correct habit patterns. All aviation  instructors shoulder an enormous responsibility because their learners will ultimately be flying, servicing, or repairing aircraft. Flight  instructors may have the additional responsibility regarding evaluation of learner pilots and deciding when they are ready to solo.  The flight instructor’s   job    to   “mold” the learner   pilot into   a safe pilot who   takes a professional approach   to   flying.   Other flight  instructor responsibilities can be found in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61 and FAA advisory circulars  (ACs).  [Figure 8-5]  

#  

# Figure 8-5.  The flight instructor has many additional responsibilities.  

Instructors should be current and proficient in the aircraft they use and encourage each pilot to learn as much as possible and to  continually   “raise the bar.” Flight instructors   teach   other   pilots   to   remain   focused   on   safety   of   flight and   to   use risk   mitigation. It is  also important to provide an understanding of why pilots are trained to standards, how these standards are set, and that meeting the  standard provides a limited margin of safety.  

# Physiological Obstacles for Flight Learners  

Although most learner pilots have been exposed to air travel, they may not have flown in light, training aircraft. Consequently,  learners may react to unfamiliar noises or vibrations, or experience unfamiliar sensations due to G-force, or an uncomfortable feeling  in the stomach. To teach effectively, instructors cannot ignore the existence of these negative factors, nor should they ridicule learners  who are adversely affected. These negative sensations can usually be overcome by understanding the nature of their causes.  Remember, a sick learner is preoccupied and may not have the mental or physical capacity to learn.  

# Ensuring Learner Skill Set  

Flight instructors ensure learner pilots develop the required skills and knowledge prior to solo flight. The learner pilot needs to show  consistency in the required solo tasks: takeoffs and landings, ability to prioritize maintaining control of the aircraft, proficiency in  flight, traffic pattern operation, proper navigation skills, and proper radio procedure and communication skills. Learner pilots should  receive instruction to ask for assistance or help from the ATC system when needed.  

Mastery of the skill set includes consistent use as well as increased accuracy of performance. The decision to determine when a  learner is ready for solo flight should be a joint decision between learner and instructor. Generally, this determination is made when  the instructor observes the learner from preflight to engine start to engine shutdown and the learner performs consistently, without  need of instructor assistance.  

Flight instructors need to provide adequate flight and ground instruction for each item included in the applicable ACS/ PTS. The ACS  integrates risk management and safety throughout and with supplementary appendix information. PTS lists special emphasis items.  Some common items include:  

1. Positive aircraft control  2. Procedures for positive exchange of flight controls  3. Stall and spin awareness  4. Collision avoidance  5. Wake turbulence and low-level wind turbulence and wind shear avoidance  6. Runway incursion avoidance  7. Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)  8. Aeronautical decision-making (ADM)/risk management  9. Checklist usage  10. Spatial disorientation  11. Temporary flight restrictions (TFR)  12. Special use airspace (SUA)  13. Aviation security  14. Wire strike avoidance  

Flight instructors should be current on the latest procedures regarding pilot training, certification, and safety. It is the flight  instructor’s   responsibility    maintain   a current library   of   information.   These sources   are listed    the appropriate ACS/PTS, and other  sources can be located on the Internet at  www.faa.gov  and  www.faasafety.gov . The FAA websites provide comprehensive  information to pilots and instructors. Other aviation organizations also have excellent information. However, an instructor should  follow procedures in the manner prescribed by the FAA. If an instructor needs any assistance, he or she should contact a more  experienced instructor, an FAA Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), or the local Flight Standards District Office (FSDO).  

# Aviator's Model Code of Conduct  

The Aviator’s   Model Code of   Conduct presents   broad   guidance   and   recommendations   for   General Aviation   (GA)   pilots   to   improve  airmanship, flight safety, and to sustain and improve the GA community. The Code of Conduct presents a vision of excellence in GA  aviation.   Its   principles both   complement and   supplement what is   merely   legal.   The Code of   Conduct is   not a “standard” and    not  intended to be implemented as such. The code of conduct consists of the following seven sections:  

1. General Responsibilities of Aviators  2. Passengers and People on the Surface  3. Training and Proficiency  4. Security  5. Environmental Issues  6. Use of Technology  7.  Advancement and Promotion of General Aviation  

Each section provides flight instructors a list of principles and sample recommended practices. Successful instructor pilots continue to  self-evaluate and   find   ways   to   make themselves safer   and   more productive.   The Aviator’s   Model Code of   Conduct provides guidance   and   principles instructors   should   integrate into   their   own   practices. More information   about the Aviator’s   Model Code of   Conduct can  be found at  www.secureav.com .  

# Safety Practices and Accident Prevention  

Aviation instructors are on the front line of efforts to improve the safety record of the aviation industry. Safety, one of the most  fundamental considerations in aviation training, is paramount. Comprehensive FAA regulations promote safety by eliminating or  mitigating conditions that can cause death, injury, or damage, but even the strictest compliance with regulations may not guarantee  safety. Rules and regulations are designed to address known or suspected conditions detrimental to safety, but there is always a  chance that some new combination of circumstances not contemplated by the regulations will arise. It is important for aviation  instructors to be proactive to ensure the safety of flight or maintenance training activities.  

The safety practices aviation instructors emphasize have a long-lasting effect on learners. Generally, learners consider their instructor  to   be a role model whose habits   they   attempt to   imitate,   whether   consciously   or   unconsciously.   The instructor’s   advocacy   and   description of safety practices mean little to a learner if the instructor does not demonstrate them consistently. For example, if a  maintenance learner observes the instructor violating safety practices by not wearing safety glasses around hazardous equipment, the  learner probably will not be conscientious about using safety equipment when the instructor is not around. One of the best actions a  flight or maintenance instructor can take to enhance aviation safety is to emphasize safety by example.  

Another way for the instructor to advocate safety is to partner with the FAA Safety Team (FAASTeam). The FAASTeam is dedicated  to improving the aviation safety record by conveying safety principles and practices through training, outreach, and education. More  information is available at  FAASafety.gov .  

# Flight Instructor Qualifications  

A flight instructor needs to be thoroughly familiar with the functions, characteristics, and proper use of all flight instruments,  avionics, and other aircraft systems being used for training. This is especially important due to the wide variety in global positioning  systems (GPS) and glass panel displays.  

Each flight instructor should maintain familiarity with current pilot training techniques and certification requirements. Frequent  review of new periodicals and technical publications, personal contacts with FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners (DPE),  and participation in pilot and flight instructor clinics such as the FAASTeam/SAFE quarterly series of Flight Instructor Open Forums  facilitate awareness of current requirements. Additional information can be obtained from veteran flight instructors.  [Figure 8-6]  The  continued use of outmoded instructional procedures or the preparation of learners using obsolete certification requirements usually  involves rationalization.  

![](images/4ae6026a46353365a65a9adfafe973886603b254e56286e931c01d280afb7c72.jpg)  

# Professionalism  

The aviation instructor is the central figure in aviation training and bears responsib i lity for all phases of required training.  The instructor, either pilot or aircraft maintenance technician, needs to be a professional. As professionals, aviation instructors  strive to maintain the highest level of knowledge, training, and currency in the field of aviation. To achieve this goal,  instructors need to commit themselves to continuous, lifelong learning and professional development through study, service,  and membership in professional organizations such as the Society of Aviation and Flight Educators (SAFE), the National  Association of Flight Instructors (NAFI) and Professional Aviation Mechanics Association (PAMA). Professionals build a library  of resources that keeps them informed of the most current procedures, publications, and educational opportunities. Being a  professional also means behaving in a professional manner.  [Figure 8-7]  An aviation instructor should strive to practice the  characteristics on the Instructor Do’s list when teaching a learner.

Figure 8-7.  Guidelines for an aviation instructor.  

# Sincerity  

An aviation learner normally accepts a competent instructor as a teacher. However, the aviation instructor should be straightforward  and honest at all times. Attempting to hide inadequacy behind a smokescreen of unrelated instruction makes it impossible for the  instructor to command the respect and full attention of a learner. Any facade of instructor pretentiousness, whether it is real or  mistakenly presumed, causes the learner to lose confidence in the instructor and adversely affects learning.  

# Acceptance of the Learner  

The instructor needs to accept learners as they are, including all their faults and problems. The learner is a person who wants to learn,  and the instructor is a person who is available to help in the learning process. The professional relationship between the instructor and  learner should be based on a mutual acknowledgement that the learner and the instructor are important to each other, and that both are  working toward the same objective.  

Under no circumstance should the instructor do anything which implies degrading the learner. Acceptance (rather than ridicule) and  support (rather than reproof) encourage learning. Learners need to be treated with respect, regardless of whether they are quick to  learn or require more time to absorb certain concepts. Criticizing a learner who does not learn rapidly is similar to a doctor  reprimanding a patient who does not get well as rapidly as predicted.  

# Personal Appearance and Habits  

Personal appearance   has an   important effect on   the professional image of   the instructor.   Today’s   aviation   customer   expects   an instructor to be neat, clean, and appropriately dressed. Since the instructor is engaged in a learning situation, the attire worn should be  appropriate to professional status.  [Figure 8-8]  

![](images/5b5ae9aeeed4c3d32682755679b72b6260437442f074e0d63a843973d42090c0.jpg)  
Figure 8-8.  The aviation instructor should always present a professional appearance.  

Personal habits have a significant effect on the professional image. The exercise of common courtesy is perhaps the most important of  these. An instructor who is rude, thoughtless, and inattentive cannot hold the respect of a learner, regardless of the instructor’s   ability   as a pilot or aviation maintenance technician. Personal cleanliness is important to aviation instruction. Frequently, an instructor and a  learner work in close proximity, and even little annoyances such as body odor or bad breath can cause serious distractions from  learning the tasks at hand.  

# Demeanor  

The attitude and behavior of the instructor can contribute much to a professional image. The instructor should avoid erratic  movements, distracting speech habits, and capricious changes in mood. The professional image requires development of a calm,  thoughtful, and disciplined demeanor.  

The successful instructor avoids contradictory directions, reacting differently to similar or identical errors at different times,  demanding unreasonable performance or progress, criticizing a learner unfairly, or presenting an overbearing manner or air of  flippancy. Effective instruction is best conducted in a calm, pleasant, thoughtful manner that puts the learner at ease. The instructor  should   constantly   demonstrate competence    the subject matter   and   genuine interest in   the learner’s   well-being.  

# Proper Language  

In aviation instruction, as in other professional activities, the use of profanity and obscene language leads to distrust or, at best, to a  lack of complete confidence in the instructor. Many people object to such language. The professional instructor speaks normally,  without inhibitions, and speaks positively and descriptively, without profanity.  

# Evaluation of Learner Ability  

Evaluation   of   a learner’s   ability    an   important element of   instruction.   Used   in   this   context, evaluation   refers   to   judging   a learner’s   ability to perform a maneuver or procedure.  

# Demonstrated Ability  

Evaluation of demonstrated ability during flight or maintenance instruction is based upon established standards of performance,  suitably   modified   to   apply   to   the learner’s   experience   and   stage of   development as a pilot or   mechanic.   The evaluation   considers the  learner’s   mastery   of   the elements   involved   in   the maneuver   or   procedure,   rather   than   merely   the overall performance.   For   example,  qualification of learner pilots for solo and solo cross-country privileges depends upon demonstrations of performance.  

# Keeping the Learner Informed  

When evaluating learner demonstrations of ability, the aviation instructor should keep the learner informed of progress. This may be  done as each procedure or maneuver is completed or summarized during a postflight or class critique. These critiques should be in a  written format, such as notes, to aid the instructor in covering all areas that were noticed during the flight or lesson. When explaining  errors in performance, instructors point out the elements in which the deficiencies are believed to have originated and, if possible,  suggest appropriate corrective measures.  

# Professional Development  

Aviation is changing rapidly, and aviation instructors need to continue to develop their knowledge and skills in order to teach  successfully in this environment. The aviation instructor is well respected by other technicians and pilots because instructors have  trained extensively to be certificated. Flight instructors undergo comprehensive evaluations and a practical test to obtain a flight  instructor certificate. 14 CFR part 147 requires all instructors teaching maintenance subjects to hold an FAA certificate as an aircraft  maintenance technician.  

Successful, professional aviation instructors do not become complacent or satisfied with their own qualifications and abilities and are  constantly alert for ways to improve their qualifications, effectiveness, and the services they provide to learners. Considered by their  learners to be a source of up-to-date information, instructors have the opportunity and responsibility to introduce new procedures and  techniques both to their learners and to other aviation professionals with whom they come in contact.  

# Continuing Education  

A professional aviation instructor continually updates his or her knowledge and skills. This goal is attained in a variety of ways, such  as reading an article in a technical publication or taking a course at a technical school. There are many different sources of  information the aviation instructor can use in order to remain current in aviation knowledge and teaching.  

# Government  

One of the first educational sources for the instructor is the FAA and other governmental agencies. The FAA either sponsors or  collaborates in sponsoring aviation programs, seminars, and workshops for the public. For example, the FAA conducts safety  seminars around the country in conjunction with the aviation industry. These seminars, although directed at pilots, can be a useful  source of knowledge for aviation instructors.  

The FAA   is   a rich   source   of   information   that can   be used   to   enhance   an   instructor’s   knowledge.   Regulations,   advisory   circulars,  airworthiness directives, orders, and notices are some of the documents that can be downloaded from the FAA website at  

# www.faa.gov  

Participation in the Pilot Proficiency Awards Program is a good way for a flight instructor to improve proficiency and to serve as an  example to learners. Another way is to work toward the Gold Seal Flight Instructor Certificate. Accomplishing the requirements of  the certificate is evidence the instructor has performed at a very high level as a flight instructor. See AC 61-65, Certification: Pilots  and Flight and Ground Instructors, for a list of requirements for earning this certificate.  

Similarly, the Aviation Maintenance Awards Program affords the aviation maintenance instructor the opportunity for increased  education through attendance at FAA or industry maintenance training seminars. Details for the awarding of bronze through diamond  pins can be found in AC 65-25, Aviation Maintenance Technician Awards Program.  

The FAA approves the providers who conduct Flight Instructor Refresher Courses (FIRCs) in accordance with AC 61-83, Nationally  Scheduled FAA-Approved Industry-Conducted Flight Instructor Refresher Course. These courses are available for flight instructors  to complete the training requirements for renewal of flight instructor certificates.  

The FAA cosponsors Inspection Authorization (IA) seminars. These seminars are open to all maintenance technicians and are a good  source of additional training and education for maintenance instructors.  

# Educational/Training Institutions  

Professional aviation instructors can further increase their knowledge and skill in aviation specialties by attending classes at local  community colleges, technical schools, or universities. These schools may offer complete degree programs in aviation subjects as  well as single-subject courses of benefit to instructors.  

# Commercial Organizations  

Commercial organizations are another important source of education/training for the aviation instructor. Some may be publishers or  online suppliers of training materials while others may provide complete ground and flight training programs for professional pilots  and instructors. These companies often provide a wide variety of study programs including videos, computer-based training, and  printed publications. Many offer training that can be attended either at the home base of the company, at classes or seminars around  the country, or through internet sites.  

There are numerous organizations around the country that offer courses of training for aviation instructors. These are generally  courses that are available to all pilots and technicians but are especially useful for instructors to improve their abilities. Examples of  such courses include workshops for maintenance technicians to enhance their skills in subjects such as composites, sheet metal  fabrication, and fabric covering. For pilots, there are courses in mountain flying, spin training, upset prevention and recovery, and tail  wheel qualification to name a few. Flight instructors also may increase their aviation knowledge and experience by adding additional  category and class ratings to their certificates.  

# Industry Organizations  

Other significant sources of ongoing education for aviation instructors are aviation organizations. These organizations not only  provide educational articles in their publications, but also present training programs or cosponsor such programs.  

Many industry organizations have local affiliated chapters that make it easy to meet other pilots, technicians, and instructors. These  meetings frequently include presentations by industry experts, as well as formal training sessions. Some aviation industry  organizations conduct their own training sessions on areas such as the flight instructor refresher course and Inspection Authorization  (IA) seminars. Properly organized safety symposiums and training clinics are valuable sources of refresher training. They are also an  excellent opportunity to exchange information with other instructors.  

# Sources of Material  

An aviation instructor should maintain access to current flight publications or maintenance publications. For the flight instructor, this  includes current copies of regulations pertinent to pilot qualification and certification, Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM),  ACS/PTS, and pilot training manuals. The aviation maintenance instructor should have copies of applicable regulations, current  knowledge and ACS/PTS, and maintenance training manuals. Aviation instructors should be thoroughly familiar with current  certification and rating requirements in order to provide competent instruction. Many of the advisory circulars should be considered by  the aviation instructor as refer e nces. The  www.faa.gov  website maintains current advisory circulars under the Regulations and  Policies tab.  

In addition to government publications, a number of excellent handbooks and other reference materials are available from commercial  publishers through print and online media. Aviation periodicals and technical journals from the aviation industry are other sources of  valuable information for instructors. Many public and institutional libraries have excellent resource material on educational  psychology, teaching methods, testing, and other aviation related subjects.  

The aviation instructor has two reasons to maintain a source of current information and publications. First, the instructor needs a  steady supply of fresh material to make instruction interesting and up to date. Second, instructors should keep themselves well  informed by maintaining familiarity with what is being written in current aviation publications. Many of these publications are in  printed form, but increasingly, information is available through electronic means.  [Figure 8-9]  

# Printed Material  

In aviation, documentation in the form of flight publications or maintenance data needs to be immediately available for referral while  flying or conducting maintenance. While the portability of printed material meets this need for immediate availability, printed  material has two disadvantages. First, it takes up space for storage and second, it can be time consuming to keep printed material  current. Many publishers of printed material now make their information available in electronic format. For example, most FAA  regulations, standards, and guides are available either in electronic form or as hard copy.  

Non-FAA publications are available through the GPO and from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Publications not  printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office are available from the many publishers and suppliers of books. Commercial  publishers usually provide catalogues and toll-free numbers or websites for ordering their products.  

![](images/dddec97ba2b2e218e826ae48eb57e48cf6dc4b26d14606b4cee7c240179cd293.jpg)  
Figure 8-9.  Aviation instructors can improve their knowledge by becoming familiar with information on the internet.  

# Electronic Sources  

Access to the internet via personal computers, tablets, and smartphones has opened up a vast storehouse of information for the  aviation instructor at the FAA website,  www.faa.gov  and many, many other websites and apps.  

Professional aviation instructors should continue to expand their knowledge and skills in order to remain competent. The field of  aviation is advancing, and the instructor also needs to advance. Instructors can best do this by taking advantage of the wide variety of  materials available from the FAA, other government agencies, commercial publishers and vendors, and from industry trade groups.  These materials are available at training sessions and seminars, from printed books, papers, magazines, and from the internet and  other electronic sources. Instructors who commit to continuing education are able to provide the highest quality instruction to their  learners.  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter discussed the responsibilities of aviation instructors to the learner, the public, and the FAA in the training process. The  additional responsibilities of flight instructors who teach new learner pilots as well as rated pilots seeking add-on certification, the  role of aviation instructors as safety advocates, and ways in which aviation instructors can enhance their professional image and  development were explored.  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 9: Techniques of Flight Instruction  

# Introduction  

Flight instructor Daniel decides his learner, Mary, has gained enough confidence and experience that it is time for her to develop  personal weather minimums. While researching the subject at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website, he locates several  sources that provide background information indicating that weather often poses some of the greatest risks to general aviation (GA)  pilots, regardless of their experience level. He also finds charts and a lesson plan he can use.  

Daniel’s   decision   to   help   Mary   develop   personal weather   minimums   reflects a key   component of   the flight instructor’s   job: providing  the learner   with   the tools   to   ensure safety   during   a flight. What does “safety” really   mean?   How   can   a flight instructor   ensure the  safety of flight training activities, and also train clients to operate their aircraft safely after they leave the relatively protected flight  training environment?  

According to one definition, safety is the freedom from conditions that can cause death, injury, or illness; damage to loss of  equipment or property, or damage to the environment. FAA regulations are intended to promote safety by eliminating or mitigating  conditions that can cause death, injury, or damage. These regulations are comprehensive but instructors recognize that even the  strictest compliance with regulations may not guarantee safety. Rules and regulations are designed to address known or suspected  conditions detrimental to safety, but there is always the possibility that a combination of hazardous circumstances will arise.  

The recognition   of   aviation   training   and   flight operations   as a system   led   to   a “system   approach” to   aviation   safety.   This   chapter  discusses some of the practices found to make flight safer on a systemic basis including—aeronautical decision-making (ADM), risk  management, situational awareness, and single-pilot resource management (SRM). These components should be included in a modern  flight training program.  

# Practical Flight Instructor Strategies  

During all phases of flight training, instructors should remember that individuals learn through observing others; therefore, the  instructor needs to model safe and professional behavior. The flight instructor should demonstrate good operational sense at all times:  

⦁  Before the flight—discuss safety and the importance of a proper preflight and use of the checklist.  ⦁  During flight—prioritize the tasks of aviating, navigating, and communicating. Instill importance of aircraft      control, “see and avoid,”   situational awareness, and workload management in the learner.  ⦁  During landing—conduct stabilized approaches, maintain desired airspeed on final, demonstrate good      judgment for go-arounds, wake turbulence, traffic, and terrain avoidance. Correct faulty approaches and      landings. Make touchdowns on the centerline in the first third of the runway.  ⦁  After the flight—review or discuss flight events and choices using ADM principles. Plan a remediation  if trends indicate an inadequate skill, a hazardous attitude, or inadequate knowledge of risk mitigation.  

Flight instructors should produce safe pilots. For that reason, instructors should encourage each learner to learn as much as possible.  When introducing lesson tasks, flight instructors should not focus on the minimum acceptable standards for passing the checkride.  The ACS/PTS is not a teaching tool. It is a testing tool. The overall focus of flight training should be on education, learning, and  understanding why the standards are there and how they were set. The completion standards for each lesson should gradually reach or  exceed those in the ACS/PTS before final preparation for the checkride.  

# Integrating Instruction Techniques  

A flight instructor uses many instructional techniques during ground instruction, when using simulation, and during hands-on aircraft  training. Since flight training costs are high and new aircraft are more complex than in the past, the total training experience should  provide a solid   base of   knowledge and   maximize the learner’s   time without sacrificing   the quality   of   the end   product.   This   section  looks at teaching techniques in greater detail.  

# Ground Instruction  

Ground instruction can be highly effective if it follows a n   overall plan designed to prepare the learner for flight. In Chapter 7,  Planning Instructional Activity,  Figure 7-2  shows a ground lesson that includes clear objectives. However, ground training  objectives should be related to flight training objectives whenever possible. When elements are taught on the ground (as theory),  their practice and application is also experienced in the air. The instructor should point out the connection between the theory and  practice to maximize the benefit from integrated ground and flight instruction.  [Figure 9-1]  

Additionally, ground instruction need not be in the classroom for maximum effectiveness. For example, conduct a preflight using an  actual aircraft although initially taught in an academic setting. Additionally, when airspace is being taught an invaluable  reinforcement of training includes taking the learners to ATC facilities where they can see management of the National Airspace  System (NAS) from another perspective.  

![](images/92706a3547d9cf929bac25fa489767f98e63036c2d1c59b1a0701f59f2b0fa03.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.  The learner prepares to execute a power-off stall maneuver in-flight that was taught in ground school.  

Studies have shown that a mix of instructional elements provides the best balance during ground instruction. Learners who use  electronic media extensively are generally not as well trained as those who receive a balanced mix of ground teaching methods that  include e-learning, class, and one-on-one instruction integrated with technological tools that support the instruction versus replacing  it.  

Ground instruction is a key element that sets the foundation and is critical to learner pilots becoming well educated and successfully  transitioning   into   the flight environment. It should   be deliberative,   supportive of   the learner’s   interwoven   flight education, and highly  rewarding to both the learner and instructor(s) alike.  

# Use of Flight Simulation Training Devices  

The FAA separates flight simulation trainers into three specific categories:  

⦁  Full Flight Simulator (FFS)  ⦁  Flight Training Device (FTD)  ⦁  Aviation Training Device (ATD)  

The National Simulator Program located in Atlanta, GA provides for the evaluation and qualification of FFSs and FTDs. 14 CFR part  60 provides the criteria for the qualification of FFSs  [Figure 9-2]  and FTDs  [Figures 9-3 and   $9–4J$  and further divides these  qualifications as FFS Level A-D and FTD Level 4-7. A qualification letter is provided annually by the FAA to the operator and  identifies the level of qualification. The level of approval affects what maneuvers or tasks may be accomplished in an FFS or FTD.  These FAA-qualified trainers are collectively described in part 60 as Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD). Each device  requires sponsorship by a part 119 certificate holder (part 135/121 operators), or a part 141/142 Pilot School/Training Center, and are  most often used by the airlines or aviation colleges/universities. All training accomplished in FFSs and FTDs is part of an FAA- approved training program.  

![](images/cd5e4f987f578c3325610f4eff05352619a0a4a9ae6783e805b8aa2810b72a37.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.  A Level C simulator.  

The General Aviation and Commercial Division located in Washington, DC provides for the evaluation and approval of ATDs.  Advisory Circular AC 61-136,  FAA Approval of Aviation Training Devices and Their Use for Training and Experience  provides the  criteria for ATD approvals and use, and further divides them into two categories; Basic or Advanced ATD approvals  (BATD/AATD). The letter of authorization provided by the FAA to the manufacturer specifies the training credits or experience  requirements that can be acquired using that model trainer. These training devices are predominately used by general aviation flight  schools providing flight training under 14 CFR part 61 or part 141 regulations. ATDs cannot be used for airman practical tests or type  rating training requirements.

Figure 9-3.  An example of a Level 6 Flight Training Device (FTD).  

# Integrated Training Curricula  

An integrated training curriculum can use an FFS, FTD, or ATD to provide seamless training from the classroom to the aircraft. An  instructor initially provides the required knowledge in a classroom environment and then follows with procedural training in the  simulator. For example, when utilizing an integrated ground and flight-training program, an authorized instructor would initially teach  the required knowledge specific to instrument landing system (ILS) design, and the associated flight operations through ground and  classroom training. The instructor then provides instruction on aircraft flight procedures and details specific to operations in national  airspace system. After the learner has gained the required knowledge and understands the procedures, the instructor then adds  practicing the psychomotor skills of the task in the simulator. The instructor would then demonstrate and teach the instrument  approach task to the learner simulating the flight environment in a FAA-qualified trainer. When the student becomes proficient with  the instrument procedure in the simulator, the instruction would then transition to the aircraft to verify proficiency and reinforce the  airman certification standards. Most operational tasks and procedures for private pilot certificates, instrument ratings, commercial  pilot certificates, and airline transport pilot certificates can be initially taught in an FFS, FTD, or ATD.  

# Logging Training Time and Experience  

Instructors or pilots logging time in an FFS or FTD should log and record the FAA ID number or serial number of the device being  used for training. FSTDs are re-qualified on an annual basis and users should verify the qualification is current and valid. When  logging training time in an ATD, pilot time is logged as a basic aviation training device (BATD) or advanced aviation training device  (AATD) time, and the pilot record should identify the manufacturer and model of the ATD trainer. Letters of authorization (LOAs)  for   ATD’s   are valid   for   five years   and   a copy   of   the LOA   should   be retained   by   the pilot in   training.  

Pilot time logged in an FFS, FFS, or ATD must be recorded as prescribed in 14 CFR part 61, section 61.51(h). The maximum credit  permitted for certificates and ratings is identified in part 61 and 141. However, there is no limit on how much time can be logged in  an FFS, FTD, or ATD. The FAA recommends that training should continue in the simulator until the required tasks are accomplished  successfully, before attempting the same tasks in an aircraft.

# On-Aircraft Training  

On-aircraft training is the continuation of work that is initiated on the ground and part of the integrated training process. As indicated  in Chapter 7, Planning Instructional Activity, the instructor must plan the flight given to the learner to the same extent as the learner  who prepares for it. Just as it is important to have objectives for ground instruction, it is equally important that the flight instruction  have objectives and a syllabus paired with previous instruction given on the ground (to include academic training). Flight training is  not a one size fits all and often must be tailored for the individual. For example, satisfactory progress in learning stalls through flight  instruction   “only” would   be diminished   as compared   to   discussing   them   on   the ground; inclusive of   the types, stalls,   and   their  aerodynamic basis. Just because the learner has received ground school instruction on a particular aspect, the instructor should always  review that same task with the learner before flight to reinforce the learning process as necessary.  [Figure 9-5]

Figure 9-5.  Reinforcing what the learner was taught on the ground is critical to learner knowledge.  

On-aircraft training is integrated with ground instruction and not autonomously separate and distinct. By pairing flight and ground  instruction together, the learner will advance further, faster, and attain more of the educational goals the instructor tries to impart.  

# Demonstration-Performance Training Delivery Method  

The demonstration-performance training delivery method was discussed briefly in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process, but the following  in-depth discussion is geared to the flight instructor. This training method has been in use for a long time and is very effective in  teaching kinesthetic skills so flight instructors find it valuable in teaching procedures and maneuvers. The demonstration-performance  method is divided into four phases: explanation, demonstration, learner performance with instructor supervision, and evaluation.  [Figure 9-6]  

# Explanation Phase  

The flight instructor needs to be well prepared and highly organized to teach complex maneuvers and procedures effectively. The  learner should be intellectually and psychologically ready for the learning activity. The explanation phase is accomplished prior to the  flight lesson with a discussion of lesson objectives and completion standards, as well as a thorough preflight briefing. The instructor  presents clear and pertinent objectives of the particular lesson to be presented, based on the known experience and knowledge of the  learner. Instructors need to provide details on the lesson content, performance expectations and evaluation measures. When teaching a  skill, the instructor conveys the precise actions the learner will perform. In addition to the necessary steps, the instructor should  describe the end result of these efforts. The explanation phase also should include coverage of appropriate safety procedures. Before  leaving this phase, the instructor should encourage learners to ask questions about any step of the procedure that they do not  understand.  

# Demonstration Phase  

The instructor demonstrates the actions necessary to perform a skill and may describe the actions simultaneously. The instructor  avoids extraneous activity as much as possible so that learners get a clear understanding of the task. If, due to some unanticipated  circumstances, the demonstration does not closely conform to the explanation, this deviation should be immediately acknowledged  and explained.  

![](images/b500bc5794903d57bcdee5a6f34541d6fea36058bbc7e7270ca96996fd91d97b.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.  The demonstration-performance method of teaching has four essential phases.  

# Learner Performance and Instruction Supervision Phases  

As discussed in Chapter 5, The Teaching Process, these two phases involve separate actions that are performed concurrently. The first  of   these phases    the learner’s   performance   of   the physical or   mental skills   that have been   explained   and   demonstrated.   The second  activity    the instructor’s   supervision.  

Learner performance requires learners to act and do. To gain skills, learners must practice. The instructor must, therefore, allot  enough time for meaningful activity. Through doing, learners can follow correct procedures and reach established standards. It is  important that learners be given an opportunity to perform the skill as soon as possible after a demonstration.  

Then, the instructor reviews what has been covered during the instructional flight and determines to what extent the learner has met  the objectives outlined during the preflight discussion. The instructor should be satisfied that the learner is well prepared and  understands the task before starting. The instructor observes as the learner performs, and then makes appropriate comments.  

# Evaluation Phase  

In   this   phase,   the instructor   traditionally   evaluates learner   performance,   records   the learner’s   performance,   and   verbally   advises the  learner of the progress made toward the objectives. Regardless of how well a skill is taught, there may still be performance  deficiencies. When pointing out areas that need improvement, offer concrete suggestions that help. If possible, avoid ending the  evaluation on a negative note.  

As discussed in Chapter 6, Assessment, collaborative assessment (or learner centered grading (LCG)) is a form of authentic  assessment currently used in aviation training with problem-based learning (PBL). PBL structures the lessons to confront learners  with problems that are encountered in real life and forces them to reach real-world solutions. Scenario-based training (SBT), a type of  PBL, uses a highly structured script of real-world experiences to address aviation training objectives in an operational environment.  Collaborative assessment is used to evaluate whether certain learning criteria were met during the SBT.  

Collaborative assessment includes two parts—learner self-assessment and a detailed assessment by the flight instructor. The purpose  of the self-assessment is to stimulate growth in the learner’s thought processes and, in turn, behaviors. The self-assessment is followed  by an in-depth discussion between the instructor and the learner which compares the instructor’s assessment to the learner’s self- assessment.  

# The Telling-and-Doing Technique  

The demonstration-performance method can be applied to the telling-and-doing technique of flight instruction in three steps.  However, the telling-and-doing technique includes specific variations for flight instruction.  [Figure 9-7]  

![](images/79682e4adfb2daba80b163b4272f107e5b75eb058d5d2a6ef1aa449706ddad4d.jpg)  

# Instructor Tells—Instructor Does  

First, the flight instructor gives a carefully planned demonstration of the procedure or maneuver with accompanying verbal  explanation. While demonstrating inflight maneuvers, the instructor should explain the required power settings, aircraft attitudes, and  describe any other pertinent factors that may apply. This is the only step in which the learner plays a passive role. It is important for  the demonstration to conform to the explanation as closely as possible. In addition, it should be demonstrated in the same sequence in  which   it was explained   so   as to   avoid   confusion   and   provide reinforcement. Since   learners   generally   imitate the instructor’s   performance, the instructor needs to demonstrate the skill exactly the way the learners are expected to practice it, including all safety  procedures that should be followed. As previously explained, if the demonstration does not closely conform to the explanation, this  deviation should be immediately acknowledged and explained.  

Most physical skills lend themselves to a sequential pattern where the skill is explained in the same step-by-step order normally used  to perform it. When the skill being taught relates to previously learned procedures or maneuvers, the known to unknown strategy may  be effective. When teaching more than one skill at the same time, the simple-to-complex strategy works well. By starting with the  simplest skill, a learner gains confidence and is less likely to become frustrated when building skills that are more complex.  

Another consideration in this phase is the language used. Instructors should attempt to avoid unnecessary jargon and technical terms  that their learners do not know. Instructors should also take care to clearly describe the actions learners are expected to perform.  Communication is the key. It is neither appropriate nor effective for instructors to try to impress learners with their expertise by using  language that is unnecessarily complicated.  

As an example, a level turn might be demonstrated and described by the instructor in the following way:  

⦁  Use outside visual references and monitor the flight instruments.  ⦁  After clearing the airspace around the aircraft, add power slightly, turn the aircraft in the desired direction,      and apply a slight amount of back pressure on the yoke to maintain altitude. Maintain coordinated flight by      applying rudder in the direction of the turn.  ⦁  Remember, the ailerons control the roll rate, as well as the angle of bank. The rate at which the aircraft      rolls depends on how much aileron deflection is used. How far the aircraft rolls (steepness of the bank)      depends on how long the ailerons are deflected, since the aircraft continues to roll as long as the ailerons      are deflected. When the desired angle of bank is reached, neutralize the ailerons, and trim as appropriate.  ⦁  Lead the roll-out by approximately one-half the number of degrees of the angle of bank. Use coordinated      aileron and rudder control pressures. Simultaneously begin releasing the back pressure so aileron, rudder,      and elevator pressures are neutralized when the aircraft reaches the wings-level position.  ⦁  Leading the roll-out heading by one-half the bank angle is a good rule of thumb for initial training.      However, keep in mind that the required amount of lead really depends on the type of turn, turn rate, and      roll-out rate. As a pilot gains experience, he or she will develop a consistent roll-in and roll-out technique      for various types of turns. Upon reaching a wings-level attitude, reduce power and trim to remove control      pressures.  

# Learner Tells—Instructor Does  

Second, the learner tells as the instructor does. In this step, the learner actually plays the role of instructor, telling the instructor what  to do and how to do it. Two benefits accrue from this step: the learner, being freed from the need to concentrate on performance of  the maneuver and from concern about its outcome, is able to organize his or her thoughts regarding the steps involved and the  techniques to be used. In the process of explaining the maneuver as the instructor performs it, perceptions begin to develop into  insights. Mental habits begin to form with repetition of the instructions previously received. Plus, the instructor is able to evaluate the  learner’s   understanding   of   the factors   involved    performance   of   the maneuver.  

According to the principle of primacy, it is important for the instructor to make sure the learner gets it right the first time. The learner  should also understand the correct sequence and be aware of safety precautions for each procedure or maneuver. If a  misunderstanding exists, it can be corrected before the learner becomes absorbed in controlling the aircraft.  

# Learner Tells—Learner Does  

Application is the third step in this method. This is where learning takes place and where performance habits are formed. If the  learner has been adequately prepared and the procedure or maneuver fully explained and demonstrated, meaningful learning occurs.  The instructor   should   be alert during   the learner’s   practice to   detect any   errors   in   technique and   to   prevent the formation   of faulty  

At the same time, the learner should be encouraged to think about what to do during the performance of a maneuver, until it becomes  habitual. In this step, the thinking is done verbally. This focuses concentration on the task to be accomplished, so that total  involvement in   the maneuver    fostered.   All of   the learner’s   physical and   mental faculties   are brought into   play.   The instructor should  be aware of   the learner’s   thought processes. It is easy    determine whether   an   error    induced   by   a misconception   or   by   a simple lack  of motor skills. Therefore, in addition to forcing total concentration on the part of the learner, this method provides a means for  keeping the instructor aware of what the learner is thinking. The learner is not only learning to do something, but he or she is also  learning a self-teaching process that is highly desirable in development of a skill.  

The exact procedures that the instructor   should   use during   learner   practice depend   on   factors   such   as the learner’s   proficiency level,  the type of maneuver, and the stage of training. The instructor should exercise good judgment to decide how much control to use.  With potentially hazardous or difficult maneuvers, the instructor should be alert and ready to take control at any time. This is  especially   true during   a learner’s   first attempt at a particular   maneuver.   On   the other   hand,    a learner    progressing   normally, the  instructor should avoid unnecessary interruptions or too much assistance.  

A   typical test   of   how   much   control is   needed   often   occurs   during   a learner’s   first few   attempts   to   land   an   aircraft. The instructor must  quickly   evaluate the learner’s   need   for   help,   and   not hesitate to   take control, if   required.   At the same time,   the learner   should be  allowed to practice the entire maneuver often enough to achieve the level of proficiency established in the lesson objectives. Since  this is a learning phase rather than an evaluation phase of the training, errors or unsafe practices should be identified and corrected in  a positive and timely way. In some cases, the learner is not able to meet the proficiency level specified in the lesson objectives within  the allotted time. When this occurs, the instructor should be prepared to schedule additional training.  

# Positive Exchange of Flight Controls  

Positive exchange of flight controls is an integral part of flight training. It is especially critical during the demonstration-performance  method of flight instruction. Due to the importance of this subject, the following discussion provides guidance on the recommended  procedure to use for the positive exchange of flight controls between pilots when operating an aircraft.  

# Background  

Incident/accident statistics indicate a need to place additional emphasis on the exchange of control of an aircraft by pilots. Numerous  accidents have occurred due to a lack of communication or misunderstanding regarding who had actual control of the aircraft,  particularly between learners and flight instructors. Establishing the following procedure during initial training will ensure the  formation of a habit pattern that should stay with learners throughout their flying careers.  

# Procedure  

During flight training, there should always be a clear understanding between learners and flight instructors about who has control of  the aircraft. The preflight briefing should include procedures for the exchange of flight controls. A positive three-step process in the  exchange of flight controls between pilots is a proven procedure and one that is strongly recommended. When an instructor is  teaching a maneuver to a learner, the instructor normally demonstrates the maneuver first, then has the learner follow along on the  controls during a demonstration and, finally, the learner performs the maneuver with the instructor following along on the controls.  [Figure 9-8]  

Flight instructors should always guard the controls and be prepared to take control of the aircraft. When necessary, the instructor  should   take the controls   and   calmly   announce,   “I   have the flight controls.” If   an   instructor   allows   a learner   to   remain   on   the controls,  the instructor may not have full and effective control of the aircraft. Anxious learners can be incredibly strong and usually exhibit  reactions inappropriate to the situation. If a recovery is necessary, there is absolutely nothing to be gained by having the learner on the  controls   and   having   to   fight for   control of   the aircraft. Learners   should   never   be allowed    exceed   the flight instructor’s   limits. Flight  instructors should not exceed their own ability to perceive a problem, decide upon a course of action, and physically react within their  ability to fly the aircraft.  

#  

# Sterile Flight Deck Rule  

Commonly known as the “sterile flight deck rule,” Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR)  part 121,  section  121.542 requires airline flight crewmembers to refrain from nonessential activities during critical phases of flight. As defined in the  regulation, critical phases of flight are all ground operations involving taxi, takeoff, and landing, and all other flight operations below  10,000 feet except cruise flight. Nonessential activities include such activities as eating, reading a newspaper, or chatting. A series of  aircraft accidents caused by flight crews who were distracted from their flight duties during critical phases of the flight caused the  FAA to propose the rule. While the regulation grew out of accidents in the airline industry, it holds true for the entire aviation  community. Pilots can improve flight safety significantly by reducing distractions during critical phases of flight. It is important the  flight instructor not only teach the concept of a sterile  flight deck  but also model such behavior during flight instruction.  

# Use of Distractions  

National   Transportation   Safety   Board   (NTSB)   statistics   reveal that most stall/spin   accidents   occurred   when   the pilot’s   attention was  diverted from the primary task of flying the aircraft. Sixty percent of stall/spin accidents occurred during takeoff and landing, and  twenty percent were preceded by engine failure. Preoccupation inside or outside the flight deck while changing aircraft configuration  or trim, maneuvering to avoid other traffic, or clearing hazardous obstacles during takeoff and climb could create a potential stall/spin  situation. The intentional practice of stalls and spins seldom resulted in an accident. The real danger was inadvertent stalls induced by  distractions during routine flight situations.  

Pilots at all skill levels should be aware of the increased risk of entering into an inadvertent stall or spin or the possibil i ty of an upset  while performing tasks that are secondary to controlling the aircraft. The FAA has established a policy for use of certain distractions  on practical tests for pilot certification. The purpose is to determine that applicants possess the skills required to cope with  distractions while maintaining the degree of aircraft control required for safe flight. The most effective training is the simulation of  scenarios that can lead to inadvertent stalls by creating distractions while the learner is practicing certain maneuvers.  

Instructor responsibilities include teaching the learner to divide his or her attention between the distracting task and maintaining  control of the aircraft. The following are examples of distractions that can be used for this training:  

⦁  Drop a pencil. Ask the learner to pick it up.  ⦁  Ask the learner to determine a heading to an airport using a chart.  ⦁  Ask the learner to reset the clock.  ⦁  Ask the learner to get something from the back seat.  ⦁  Ask the learner to read the outside air temperature.  ⦁  Ask the learner to compute true airspeed with a flight computer.  ⦁  Ask the learner to identify terrain or objects on the ground.  ⦁  Ask the learner to identify a field suitable for a forced landing.  ⦁  Have the learner climb 200 feet and maintain altitude, then descend 200 feet and maintain altitude.  ⦁  Have the learner reverse course after a series of S-turns.  

It is   a flight instructor’s   responsibility   to   teach   the learner   how   to   take charge during   a flight. A   pilot in   command   (PIC)   must know  when to tell any passengers, even a Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), when the PIC finds actions in the aircraft that distract and  interfere with the safe conduct of the flight.  

# Integrated Flight Instruction  

Integrated flight instruction is flight instruction during which learners are taught to perform flight maneuvers both by outside visual  references and by reference to flight instruments. For this type of instruction to be fully effective, the use of instrument references  should   begin   the first time each   new   maneuver    introduced.   No   distinction    the pilot’s   operation   of   the flight controls is permitted,  regardless of whether outside references or instrument indications are used for the performance of the maneuver. When this training  technique is used, instruction in the control of an aircraft by outside visual references is integrated with instruction in the use of flight  instrument indications for the same operations.  

# Development of Habit Patterns  

It important for the learner to establish the habit of observing and relying on flight instruments from the beginning of flight training. It  is equally important for the learner to learn the feel and sounds of the airplane while conducting maneuvers, such as being able to  sense when the airplane is out of trim or in a nose-high or nose-low attitude. Learners who have performed all normal flight  maneuvers by reference to instruments, as well as by outside references, develop the habit of continuously monitoring their own and  the aircraft’s   performance.   The early   establishment of   the habits   of   instrument cross-check, instrument interpretation, and aircraft  control is highly useful to the learner. The habitual attention to instrument indications leads to improved landings because of more  precise airspeed control. Effective use of instruments also results in superior cross-country navigation, better coordination, and  generally, a better overall pilot competency level.  

General aviation accident reports provide ample support for the belief that reference to flight instruments is important to safety. The  safety record of pilots who hold instrument ratings is significantly better than that of pilots with comparable flight time who have  never received formal flight training for an instrument rating. Pilots in training who are asked to perform all normal flight maneuvers  by reference to instruments, as well as by outside references, will develop the habit of continuously monitoring their own and the  aircraft’s   performance.    The habits   formed   at this   time also   give the learner   a firm   foundation   for   later   training   for   an   instrument  rating.  

# Operating Efficiency  

As learners become more proficient in monitoring and correcting their own flight technique by reference to flight instruments, the  performance obtained from an aircraft increases noticeably. This is particularly true of modern, complex, or high-performance  aircraft, which are responsive to the use of correct operating airspeeds.  

The use of correct power settings and climb speeds and the accurate control of headings during climbs result in a measurable increase  in climb performance. Holding precise headings and altitudes in cruising flight definitely increases average cruising performance.  

The use of integrated flight instruction provides the learner with the ability to control an aircraft in flight for limited periods if outside  references   are lost. In   an   emergency,   this   ability   could   save the pilot’s   life and   those of   the passengers.  

During the conduct of integrated flight training, the flight instructor needs to impress on the learners and ascertain they understand  that the introduction to the use of flight instruments does not prepare them for operations in marginal weather or instrument  meteorological conditions (IMC). According to NTSB accident data, inflight encounters with weather (attempting VFR flight into  IMC) is one of the most common causes of fatalities.  

# Procedures  

Integrated flight instruction begins with the first briefing on the function of the flight controls. This briefing includes the instrument  indications to be expected, as well as the outside references to be used to control the attitude of the aircraft.  

Each new flight maneuver is introduced using both outside and instrument references with learners developing the ability to maneuver  an aircraft equally as well by instrument or outside references. They naturally accept the fact that the manipulation of the flight  controls is identical, regardless of which references are used to determine the attitude of the aircraft. This practice should continue  throughout the flight instruction for all maneuvers. To fully achieve the demonstrated benefits of this type of training, the use of visual  and instrument references must be constantly integrated throughout the training. Failure to do so lengthens the flight instruction  necessary for the learner to achieve the competency required for a private pilot certificate.  

# See and Avoid  

From the start of flight training, the instructor ensures learners develop the habit of looking for other air traffic at all times. If learners  believe the instructor assumes all responsibility for scanning and collision avoidance procedures, they do not develop the habit of  maintaining a constant vigilance, which is essential to safety. Any observed tendency of a learner to enter flight maneuvers without  first making a careful check for other air traffic needs to be corrected immediately. Recent studies of midair collisions determined  that:  

⦁  Flight instructors were onboard the aircraft in 37 percent of the accidents in the study.  ⦁  Most of the aircraft involved in collisions are engaged in recreational flying not on any type of flight plan.  ⦁  Most midair collisions occur in VFR weather conditions during weekend daylight hours.  ⦁  The vast majority of accidents occurred at or near nontowered airports and at altitudes below 1,000 feet.  ⦁  Pilots of all experience levels were involved in midair collisions, from pilots on their first solo, to 20,000      hour veterans.  ⦁  Most collisions occur in daylight with visibility greater than 3 miles.  

It is   imperative to   introduce   14   CFR   part 91,   section   91.113   “right-of-way” rules to   the learner.   Practice the “see   and   avoid” concept  at all times regardless of whether the training is conducted under VFR or instrument flight rules (IFR). For more information on how  to reduce the odds of becoming involved in a midair collision, see Advisory Circular 90-48 (as amended).  

# Assessment of Piloting Ability  

Assessment is an essential component of the teaching process and determines how, what, and how well a learner is learning. A well- designed assessment provides a learner with something constructive upon which he or she can work or build. An assessment should  provide direction and guidance to raise the level of performance. Learners must understand the purpose of the assessment; otherwise,  they will be unlikely to accept the evaluation offered and little improvement will result. There are many types of assessment but the  flight instructor generally uses the review, collaborative assessment (LCG), written tests, and performance-based tests to ascertain  knowledge or practical skill levels. Refer to Chapter 6 for an in-depth discussion of the types of assessment available to the flight  instructor.  

An assessment can also be used as a tool for reteaching. Although not all assessments lend themselves to reteaching, the instructor  should be alert to the possibility and take advantage of the opportunity when it arises. If the instructor observes a deficiency and  determines a task needs reteaching, the instructor demonstrates the maneuver, allows the learner to practice the maneuver under  direction, and finally evaluates learner accomplishment by observing the performance.  

# Demonstrated Ability  

Assessment of demonstrated ability during flight instruction must be based upon established standards of performance, suitably  modified   to   apply    the learner’s   experience   and   stage of   development as a pilot. The assessment must consider   the learner’s   mastery  of the elements involved in the maneuver, rather than merely the overall performance.  

In order for a learner to be signed off for a solo flight, the instructor needs to determine that the learner is qualified and proficient in  the flight tasks   necessary   for   the flight. The instructor   bases   this   assessment on   the learner’s   ability   to   demonstrate consistent  proficiency on a number of flight maneuvers. Pilot skill evaluations occur during the conduct of courses at FAA-approved schools,  and teaching instructors should verify that learners meet the proficiency requirements prior to sending them for any stage check.  

# Postflight Evaluation  

In assessing piloting ability, it is important for the flight instructor to keep the learner informed of progress. This may be done as each  procedure or maneuver is completed or summarized during postflight critiques. Postflight critiques should be in a written format, such  as notes to aid the flight instructor in covering all areas that were noticed during the flight or lesson. Traditionally, flight instructors  explained errors in performance, pointed out elements in which the deficiencies were believed to have originated and, if possible,  suggested   appropriate corrective measures. Traditional assessment depends   on   a grading   scale of   “excellent, good,   fair,   poor”   or  “exceeds   standards,   meets   standards,   needs   more training” which   often   meets   the instructor’s   needs   but not the needs   of   the learner.  

With the advent of SBT, collaborative assessment is used whenever the learner has completed a scenario. As discussed in Chapters 5,  The Teaching Process, and Chapter 6, Assessment, SBT uses a highly structured script of real-world experiences to address aviation  training objectives in an operational environment. During the postflight evaluation, collaborative assessment is used to evaluate  whether certain learning criteria were met during the SBT.  

Collaborative assessment includes learner self-assessment and a detailed assessment by the aviation instructor. The purpose of the  self-assessment is    stimulate growth    the learner’s   thought processes and,    turn,   behaviors.   The self-assessment is followed by an  in-depth   discussion   between   the instructor   and   the learner   which   compares the instructor’s   assessment to   the learner’s   self-assessment.  

# First Solo Flight  

During   the learner’s   first solo   flight, the instructor   needs   to   be present to   assist in   answering   questions   or   resolving   any   issues that  arise during the flight. To ensure the solo flight is a positive, confidence-building experience for the learner, the flight instructor needs  to consider time of day when scheduling the flight. Time of day is a factor in traffic congestion, possible winds, sun angles, and  reflection.  

If possible, the flight instructor needs access to a portable radio during any supervised solo operations. A radio enables the instructor  to terminate the solo operation if he or she observes a situation developing. The flight instructor needs should use good judgment  when communicating with a solo learner. Keep all radio communications to a minimum. Do not talk to the learner on short final of the  landing approach.  

# Post-Solo Debriefing  

During a post-solo   debriefing,   the flight instructor   discusses what took   place   during   the learner’s   solo   flight. It is   important for   the  flight instructor to answer any questions the learner may have as result of a solo flight. Instructors need to be involved in all aspects of  the flight to ensure the learner utilizes correct flight procedures. It is very important for the flight instructor to debrief a learner  immediately   after   a solo   flight. With   the flight vividly   etched    the learner’s   memory,   questions   about the flight will come   quickly.  

# Correction of Learner Errors  

Correction of learner errors does not include the practice of taking over from learners immediately when a mistake is made. Safety  permitting, it is frequently better to let learners progress part of the way into the mistake and find a way out. For example, in a weight- shift control aircraft the bar is moved right to turn left. A learner may show an initial tendency to move the bar in the direction of the  desired turn. This tendency dissipates with time, but allowing the learner to see the effect of his or her control input is a valuable aid  in illustrating the stability of the aircraft. It is difficult for learners to learn a maneuver properly if they seldom have the opportunity to  correct an error.  

On the other hand, learners may perform a procedure or maneuver correctly and not fully understand the principles and objectives  involved. When the instructor suspects this, learners should be required to vary the performance of the maneuver slightly, combine it  with other operations, or apply the same elements to the performance of other maneuvers. Learners who do not understand the  principles involved will probably not be able to do this successfully.  

# Pilot Supervision  

Flight instructors have the responsibility to provide guidance and restraint with respect to the solo operations of their learners. This is  by far the most important flight instructor responsibility. The flight instructor is the only person in a position to make the  determination a learner is ready for solo operations. Before endorsing a learner for solo flight, the instructor should require the learner  to demonstrate consistent ability to perform all of the fundamental maneuvers.  

# Dealing with Normal Challenges  

Instructors should teach learners how to solve ordinary problems encountered during flight. Traffic pattern congestion, change in  active runway, or unexpected crosswinds are challenges the learner masters individually before being able to perform them  collectively.  

# Visualization  

SBT lends itself well to visualization techniques. For example, have a learner visualize how the flight may occur under normal  circumstances, with the learner describing the progress of the flight. Then, the instructor adds unforeseen circumstances such as a  sudden change in weather that brings excessive winds during final approach. Other examples of SBT can have the instructor adding  undesired landing sites for balloon learner pilots, rope breaks for glider learners, and radio outages for instrument airplane learners.  Now, the learner gets to visualize how to handle the unexpected change.  

During this visualization, the flight instructor can ask questions to check the learner’s thought processes. The job of the instructor is to  challenge the learner with realistic flying situations without creating an overburdening unrealistic scenarios.  

# Practice Landings  

Aircraft speed and control take precedence over other actions during landings and takeoffs. Full stop landings help the learner  develop aircraft control, allow for careful checklist use, and allow time for detailed instruction.  

Instructors should stress touching down in the first third of the runway to ensure stopping before the end of the runway. This means  teaching learners to go-around if they do not touch down within that distance. Instructors should also stress the need for a go-around  if the landing develops an oscillation or results in a significant bounce. These techniques equip a learner for safe solo. Furthermore,  requiring the learner to make full stop la n dings during the first solo gives the instructor the opportunity to stop the flight if necessary.  

When instructing in a glider (other than a motor glider), a go-around will not be possible. Instructors should teach learners to make  low energy landings based on current weather and wind conditions. This technique prepares learners to make an off-field landing if or  when necessary.  

# Practical Test Recommendations  

Provision is made on the airman certificate or rating application form for the written recommendation of the flight instructor who has  prepared the applicant for the practical test involved. Signing this recommendation imposes a serious responsibility on the flight  instructor. A flight instructor who makes a practical test recommendation for an applicant seeking a certificate or rating should require  the applicant to thoroughly demonstrate the knowledge and skill level required for that certificate or rating. This demonstration should  in no instance be less than the complete procedure prescribed in the applicable ACS/PTS.  

When the instructor endorses the applicant for the practical test, his or her signature on the FAA Form 8710-1, Airman Certificate  and/or Rating Application, is valid for 60 days. This is also true with the flight proficiency endorsement that is placed in the  applicant’s   logbook   or   training   record   (Advisory   Circular   (AC)   61-65). These two dates should be the same.  

Instructors need to document completion of prerequisites for a practical test. Examples of all common endorsements can be found in  the current issue of AC 61-65, Appendix A. The appendix in the AC also includes references to 14 CFR part 61 for more details  concerning the respective endorsements. The examples shown contain the essential elements of each endorsement. It is not necessary  for all endorsements to be worded exactly as those in the AC. For example, changes to regulatory requirements may affect the  wording, or the instructor may customize the endorsement to accommodate any special circumstances concerning the applicant.  However, at a minimum, the instructor needs to cite the appropriate 14 CFR part 61 section that has been completed.  

FAA inspectors and DPEs rely on flight instructor recommendations as evidence of qualification for certification, and proof that a  review has been given of the subject areas found to be deficient on the appropriate knowledge test. Recommendations also provide  assurance that the applicant has had a thorough briefing on the ACS/PTS and the associated knowledge areas, maneuvers, and  procedures. If the flight instructor has trained and prepared the applicant competently, the applicant should have no problem passing  the practical test.  

If a flight instructor fails to ensure a learner pilot or additional rating pilot meets the requirements of regulations prior to making  endorsements to allow solo flight or additional rating, that instructor is exhibiting a serious deficiency in performance. The FAA may  hold that instructor accountable. Providing a solo endorsement for a learner pilot who is not proficient for solo flight operations, or  providing an endorsement for an additional rating for a pilot not meeting the appropriate regulatory requirements also represents a  breach of faith with the learner or applicant.

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Chapter 10: Teaching Practical Risk Management during Flight Instruction  

# Introduction  

Examination of accident data leads to the inevitable conclusion that many aviation accidents involve poor risk management decisions.  Therefore, effective risk management is one of the most important skills a pilot needs to learn, understand, and practice as a habit.  Since flight instructors continually deal with risk, they quickly become subject matter experts.  

Instructors know to increase the scope of risk management while teaching. For example, risk management during flight  instruction includes a consideration of the dangers from maneuvers performed incorrectly by the  learner   close to the ground, in  addition to all the other risks associated with the flight.  

Chapter 1, Risk Management and Single-Pilot Resource Management, discussed the foundations of effective risk management, as  well as other critical skills that are a part of single-pilot resource management (SRM). Flight instructors, however, may want  additional practical guidance on teaching risk management to pilots of various experience levels and applying risk management to  instructional flights. This chapter provides such practical guidance.  

# Poor Risk Management and Accident Causality  Traditional Accident Investigation Taxonomy  

Aviation accidents are investigated by both the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA). The role of the NTSB is to determine the probable cause of accidents and make recommendations, while the  FAA seeks to determine if the accident revealed deficiencies in pilot training, aircraft certification, air traffic control or another area  of FAA responsibility. The two government entities are often assisted by other interested parties, such as aircraft and/or engine  manufacturers, in an effort to determine the facts.  

The NTSB role can be illustrated by looking at a typical accident report. [ Figure 10-1]  While this accident occurred several decades  ago and the pilot had LORAN navigation, the lack of risk assessment by the pilot is typical. Pilots have confronted the same type of  scenario and many have repeated similar behavior when faced with a significant and potentially lethal hazard.

![](images/37fd0a9a07da5f3fd3d57e7206c7aeaeddc9b81d8b23f9965dd046d8b603f5db.jpg)  

Key findings of the NTSB final report of the Mooney accident, highlighted in yellow, emphasized the pilot's loss of control of the  aircraft and inadequate in-flight planning. These facts accurately described the final events of the flight leading to the loss of control.  In fact, conventional accident analysis classifies accidents such as this one as pilot error due to loss of control.  

# Risk Analysis Using the PAVE Checklist  

The NTSB report on the Mooney accident reviews the accident facts to arrive at its probable-cause finding. Yet, there is more to learn  about   the   root   causality   of   the   accident   by   examining   the   pilot’s   reaction   to   events   during   the   flight   using   the   PAVE   acronym   from  Chapter 1.  

The pilot knew about the vacuum pump failure and the instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) ahead of him. The faulty  equipment   generated   an   aircraft,   or   "A"   hazard   and   IMC   generated   an   environment   or   “V”   hazard.   The   combination   of   those   two   hazards created an unacceptable risk once the pilot decided to penetrate the weather. In addition, it is possible that the pilot’s   desire    get to his destination created an external pressure, or “E” hazard. Finally, the pilot’s assumption that he could control the   aircraft with  critical in s truments inoperative created a pilot, or “P” hazard. The risk assessment matrix [ Figure 10-2 ],    indicates  catastrophic consequences were possible from loss of control in IMC, and the likelihood of loss of control after a vacuum pump  failure, was at least occasional or even probable. Thus, the overall risk presented was high or red and needed mitigation of some kind.  

![](images/af8879b96f452f3ffa79e1f672f97877d4bf2e72932beadb2a9785be14554eec.jpg)  
Figure 10-2.  This risk matrix can be used for almost any operation by assigning likelihood and severity. In the case presented, the  likelihood of occasional and the severity as catastrophic falls in the high-risk area.  

The pilot’s most effective mitigation may have been to divert and land while still in visual  meteorological   conditions (VMC). Why   was the pilot unable to practice effective risk management on this flight? Lack of risk management training may have created an  inability to cope with a difficult situation.  

Instructors have a role and a responsibility to help pilots obtain the necessary risk management training and to adopt a safety culture  that embraces risk   management and   mitigation   of   risk.   The instructor’s   role in   risk   management should   be incorporated   at all levels of  training, from a new pilot with little experience to a multi-thousand-hour pilot taking recurrent training.  

# When to Teach Risk Management  

The importance of risk management suggests that it should be taught at the very start of flight training and should be integrated into  any actual flight training, rather than taught as a separate subject. However, it will be even more effective if the learner receives  ground instruction on this topic prior to the first flight lesson. This preliminary instruction should also be part of any formal ground  school.  

Risk management activity and discussion should be included in all preflight and postflight briefings. Learners should be encouraged  to participate and even lead such discussions as their experience increases.  

Risk management training should not be confined to initial training. Recurrent, transition, flight reviews, instrument proficiency  checks, and other training and currency events should also include risk management.  

# Identifying Risk  

As described in Chapter 1, the PAVE checklist is an effective and accepted means for identifying risk. Its four categories capture  broad   areas   of   risk   and   provide   the   learner   with   convenient   “buckets”   for   risk   identification.   Instructors should coach learners, as  required, to ensure they use the PAVE checklist methodically and consider all the sub-elements    each   bucket.   For   example,   the “P”  applies to both the learner pilot and the instructor pilot, and has two major sub-elements. The first includes pilot qualification,  currency and proficiency. The second "P" sub-element covers aeromedical hazards and risks and, as described in Chapter 1, the  acronym IMSAFE can be used to identify those hazards and risks.  

Instructors should identify common hazards that generate flight risks. The PAVE checklist can be used to analyze each hazard for its  level   of   risk.   For   example,   the   instructor   can   show   that   certain   weather   hazards   are   almost   always   “red”   and   create   a need   for  mitigation when encountered. Examples include a solid line of thunderstorms ahead, or IMC before takeoff if the pilot is not  instrument rated and cur r ent or the aircraft is not suitably IFR equipped.  

The instructor should emphasize that risk can be effectively managed, and learners should acquire the necessary skills to accomplish  this. In many cases, learners will be professionals who are used to managing risk in their workplace, although the hazards may be very  different. Instructors   should   acknowledge the learner’s   expertise in   those areas.   The instructor   should   involve the learner   in aviation  risk management decisions.  

# Assessing Risk  

In some ways, risk assessment is the most difficult part of the risk management process. Assessing risk severity (consequences) and  likelihood (probability) can be subjective during flight operations. In other aviation applications, such as aircraft certification, the  likelihood of an event is calculated mathematically, and consequences are also precisely defined. Nevertheless, risk assessment  accuracy can improve with practice and experience.  

Instructors should initially lead learners through the assessment phase of each risk identified and provide examples that will help the  learner gain confidence in risk assessment. For example, the instructor could suggest an event with a low but generally fixed  lik e lihood, such as an engine failure after takeoff. The learner should consider the outcomes from various responses to that event.  A review of the outcomes identifies the severity for the risk matrix.  

# Mitigating Risk  

As   explained   in   Chapter   1,   risk   mitigation    the “payoff” for   the risk   management process.   Effective risk   mitigation   may   allow for a  proposed flight to begin or an ongoing flight to continue. However, this is not always the case, and the pilot should be prepared to  delay or terminate any flight.  

Instructors should teach that the risk management process begins days or even weeks before a specific flight. Early in the process, if a  pilot identifies a risk that cannot be easily mitigated, such as a forecast weather system with widespread icing conditions, then the  pilot   can   transfer   the   risk   by   getting   an   airline   ticket.   Alternatively,    the   flight’s   purpose   is   just   recreational,   then   the pilot can  eliminate the risk by cancelling the flight. Other examples of risk elimination include not flying if the crosswind exceeds a limit or not  practicing stalls if the ceiling is below a set value.  

Whenever a flight is contemplated, the process to mitigate each identified risk assessed as high (red) or serious (yellow) can begin.  Instructors should emphasize to learners that medium (green) risks may be mitigated, if possible, following the principle of not  accepting unnecessary risk.  

Instructors should emphasize that even though risk management may begin days before a flight, it continues into the immediate pre­ flight planning and throughout the flight itself. Instructors can plan to introduce scenarios in-flight that simulate hazards and ask the  learner to practice how to identify, assess, and mitigate.  

The final step in risk mitigation is to consider whether or not to accept the remaining risk. A pilot accomplishes this step consciously  and on behalf of any passengers. During flight instruction, the instructor mitigates the risk associated with a learner's actions by  operating at a safe altitude and by guarding the controls. The instructor consciously accepts the risk that remains. Although the  mitigation process completes, the instructor is vigilant for any hazard that needs consideration.  

The acronym TEAM describes the steps in the mitigation process. TEAM represents transfer, eliminate, accept, and mitigate. These  steps describe actions pilots take to deal with risk appropriately. During flight instruction, the instructor takes steps to ensure safety  through risk mitigation and then operates with lower risk when the learner flies. Note that an unprepared learner constitutes a serious  hazard. Prudent risk mitigation includes using a syllabus, providing quality ground instruction, and conducting a thorough briefing  before each training flight.  

# Risk Management Tools  

The risk management process is largely intuitive, but as with many new concepts, it can be daunting to the learner, especially at the  beginning of training. Accordingly, the instructor should use available tools to simplify or make the process more orderly and  effective.  

The TEAM acronym and the risk assessment matrix discussed previously should be considered as primary tools for teaching risk  management. Learners should be encouraged to use these simple tools as a basis for conducting risk management during and after  their flight training.  

On many flights, the risk management process can be more complex, and a more sophisticated risk management tool is needed. As  discussed in Chapter 1, a flight risk assessment tool (FRAT) can serve this purpose.  

There are a variety of FRATs available from various sources. Many of these FRATs have numerical scoring systems. A fixed list of  hazards   and   associated   risks   are   presented   and   assigned   “scores”   based   on   the   severity   of   the   hazard.   Typically,    the total   score is  below a certain number, the pilot can begin the flight. If the score is above a certain number then some sort of mitigating action is  required.  

Numerical FRATs should be used with caution. A low score can still have one or more hazards and associated risks that, if not  properly mitigated, can create unacceptable levels of risk. This can happen because a risk on a particular flight is not included in the  FRAT’s   list,   or   there    only   one   risk,   but it is   extreme.   As   an   example,   a line of   embedded   thunderstorms   may   block   your   route. If  that is   the only   item   identified   as a   risk   then   the “score”   may   suggest a “go” decision   without requiring   mitigation.  

# Risk Management Teaching Techniques by Phase of Instruction  

Instructors should teach risk management using a building block approach. This method will be effective with both new pilots as well  as existing pilots who have not previously been exposed to formal risk management training.  

# Risk Management Training through the Private Pilot Level  

A new learner’s exposure to risk management should begin before the first flight and become part of a routine that  conti n ues throughout initial training. Instructors should emphasize both practical risk management techniques and skills needed to  comply with the Airman Certification Standards (ACS).  

# Pre-Solo  

Instructor-led and guided risk management training should occur during pre-solo instruction. Risk management should be part of  every preflight and post fl ight brief. To assist in structuring the risk management process, the learner should be introduced to a non­ numerical FRAT, and its use should be demonstrated by the instructor during the first few flights. By the first solo, the learner should  be able to conduct a basic risk management analysis.  

# Post-Solo Prior to Cross-Country Training  

During the initial solo and dual flights following the first solo, the learner should be able to perform a risk analysis of the planned  flight,   with   occasional   coaching   from   the   instructor.   The   instructor   should   review   the   learner’s   risk   analysis   for   all solo   flights and  provide any required feedback. At the completion of solo flights, the learner should de-brief the instructor on the risk management  aspects of the flight.  

# Cross-Country Training  

During the cross-country phase of training, learners should master risk management techniques commensurate with the complexity of  flights and the terrain along the route to the destination(s). This could include, for a private certificate, flights at night, flights in  complex airspace, or to unfamiliar airports. Instructors should ask the learner to accomplish a full risk analysis for every dual and solo  cross-country flight. The process should include use of a FRAT or other method of analysis. The instructor should review and  approve the risk   analysis,   just as   would   be done for   other   aspects   of   the learner’s   preflight preparation   and   calculations.  

# Risk Management Training for Experienced Pilots  

Risk management is not a task confined solely to the initial training environment. Instructors should ensure that risk management is  part of all training events for all certificated pilots. This is especially important for pilots who have not been exposed to risk  management standards now contained in the ACS.  

# Instrument Training  

Risk management training is vital during instruction for the instrument rating because of the potential hazards related to IMC.  Instructors should emphasize broad risk management techniques and strategies that will allow a pilot to analyze and evaluate complex  weather and other elements that generate risk. For example, an instructor might suggest that a pilot consider the risk management  aspects of flight in:  

⦁  single-engine aircraft or over terrain higher than the single-engine service ceiling of a multiengine aircraft  ⦁  aircraft with a single alternator or a single radio and navigation system  ⦁  night conditions  ⦁  low IMC  ⦁  icing conditions or at altitudes above the freezing level  

# Transition Training  

Pilots transitioning to more advanced aircraft will encounter additional types of risk associated with such aircraft. These include more  complex systems and avionics, enhanced performance, and expanded abnormal and emergency procedures. Pilots transitioning to  lighter, slower aircraft will also encounter additional risk due to less performance capability than the pilot has come to expect.  

Before teaching in advanced aircraft, instructors should ensure that they have familiarity with the aircraft and equipment. Instructors  should employ scenarios that emphasize risk management aspects of operating advanced aircraft in the National Airspace System. In  addition to risk management, other SRM skills such as automation management, task and workload management, and maintaining  situational awareness should be emphasized. In most instances, the pilot seeking training will be instrument rated and the instructor  should   evaluate the pilot’s   risk   management and   other   SRM proficiency   under   an   IFR   scenario.  

# Recurrent Training, Flight Reviews, and Instrument Proficiency Checks  

Instructors should particularly emphasize risk management during any kind of recurrent training or proficiency event. Many pilots  who held certificates prior to the introduction of the ACS may not have been exposed to formal risk management training or  evaluation.  

Instructors should consider using scenarios to evaluate pilot risk management proficiency. The scenario should be constructed in a  way   that mirrors   the pilot’s   typical operating   profile.   However,    the pilot plans    change that operating   profile,   the instructor should  discuss   or   evaluate the pilot’s   ability   to   address   any   potential new   risk   management issues. For   example,   a pilot usually   operates  flights between rural airports in Class E airspace, but is soon planning to begin flying regularly to a location in Class B airspace. In  this   case,   the instructor   should   address   the operating   requirements,   such   as Mode   $^{**}\mathrm{C}^{**}$   and   ADS-B, and the environmental risk factors  related to Class B operation.  

# Risk Management during Operational Flights  

Pilots who are already certificated conduct most of their flights without an instructor present. As an instructor, you should encourage  them to practice effective risk management on all their flights.  

Realistically, pilots will not always follow the risk management procedures discussed in this chapter. Instructors should encourage  pilots to scale their risk management procedures to match the complexity of the flight. For example, for a local flight, it is acceptable  to use an abbreviated risk management protocol using the PAVE acronym to briefly review the major elements of potential risk.  However, for longer or more complex flights it may be desirable to complete a FRAT. A key objective for instructors is to provide  risk management guidance that will allow pilots to think of risk management intuitively, as a part of the preparation for every flight  and continuously while the flight progresses.  

# Risk Management Training for Professional Pilots  

Instructors may encounter pilots who fly professionally. Many professional pilots operate as a crew and receive ongoing and recurrent  training at a Part 142 training center. Instructors who work in classrooms or simulators at such a facility will likely be proficient in  subjects such as crew resource management (CRM). They may also be exposed to other training and operating concepts, such as  threat and error management (TEM), which has similar elements to risk management.  

Instructors may encounter professional pilots who own their own aircraft and fly them outside of their professional environment. An  instructor who provides transition or other flight instruction services to professional pilots should emphasize risk management as part  of the training. Pilots who operate professionally as a crew may not be used to operating as a single-pilot, without the support  infrastructure of their professional employer. Their risk management responsibilities may need adaptation to flying their own aircraft.  

# Managing Risk during Flight Instruction  

Instructors know the need to manage risk during flight instruction. The risk management techniques are the same as taught to learners,  however, there are a few hazards that are unique to flight instruction. The resulting risk can be identified, assessed, and mitigated. For  example:  

⦁  Ask the learner to fly specific maneuvers after giving appropriate training .   ⦁  Choose practice locations that provide safe options .   ⦁  Perform maneuvers with sufficient altitude .   ⦁  Stay alert for the unexpected either from the learner or external elements .   ⦁  Be prepared to take over the control of the aircraft .  

In flight, instructors can manage risk by constantly being aware of potential risk elements and managing them in real time. To do this,  the instructor needs to maintain situational awareness of pertinent information, not only of the state of the aircraft, the surrounding  traffic, the weather, the airspace, and the surrounding area; but also what the learner is doing and planning to do.  

# Common Flight Instruction Risks  

The best process for analyzing flight instruction risks is to identify them as you would on any other flight, using the PAVE acronym.  There may be many potential risks to conducting flight instruction. The examples below are only meant to be representative.  Instructors should always conduct a risk analysis prior to providing instruction.  

# Pilot Risks  

This category involves both qualification and aeromedical risks. From a qualification perspective, instructors know that the learner  will generally be less proficient than the instructor. Instructors may also have qualification, currency, and proficiency issues.  Instructors should be familiar with aircraft, avionics, and procedures. Any unfamiliarity creates a hazard. The aeromedical risks  require the instructor to be tuned in to not only his own aeromedical state, but that of the learner.  

During flight instruction, pilot risk includes both the learner pilot and the instructor pilot. The instructor needs to be prepared for the  learner to make mistakes such as those listed in the Airplane Flying Handbook. The risks of these mistakes can be mitigated by being  proactive in planning activities based on current conditions, and by allowing enough time and space both to allow the learner to  practice and to allow the instructor to take over control of the aircraft before the situation deteriorates beyond the instructor’s   ability   to fly the aircraft.  

# Aircraft Risks  

Aircraft used in flight instruction may not always be under the direct control and maintenance supervision of the instructor, resulting  in the instructor not being aware of inoperative systems and equipment or overdue inspections. For two-place trainer aircraft, payload  is often limited, requiring a reduction in the amount of fuel carried. Performance may also be marginal in high density-altitude  situations.  

# Environmental Risks  

The airspace used for flight training and practice may be crowded, creating a potential collision hazard. Many areas of the country  where flight instruction is conducted often have restricted visibility due to haze, pollution, or other factors that aggravate a potential  collision hazard. Airspace in these areas may also be complex and subject to restrictions. Conducting certain maneuvers can also  create hazards and potential risks. For example, practicing full stalls can result in inadvertent spins. Simulated engine failures, if  performed incorrectly, can and have created real emergencies and caused accidents. Practice approaches without ATC surveillance  can concentrate aircraft along the same path.  

# External Pressure Risks  

Learners often experience scheduling problems, and this can be aggravated by aircraft problems, weather issues, and other  unpredictable events. Learners are also subject to other external pressures involving work, family, finance, and other issues. All of  these can create distractions, anxiety, and other responses that can degrade learner performance.  

# Best Practices for Managing Risk during Flight Instruction  

Instructors can best assess and mitigate identified risks by following the risk management procedures outlined in this chapter. In all  cases, the instructor should include the learner in the risk management during dual instruction. For example, the instructor should  emphasize that they are both responsible for maintaining a lookout to see and avoid other air traffic. The learner should also be  instructed on how to assist resolving items such as aircraft airworthiness status and issues involving the training environment, such as  airspace, NOTAMs, or TFRs.  

Specific mitigations for the instructional hazards and risks identified in previous paragraphs include, but are not limited to, the  following procedures.  

# Pilot Risks  

The instructor’s   qualifications   are paramount in   mitigating   currency   and   proficiency   issues. Instructors   should   familiarize themselves  with aircraft models and avionics before instructing. This could be as simple as reviewing the pilot operating handbook (POH) or  avionics manuals or as extensive as acquiring flight time in such equipment before giving instruction.  

Instructor aeromedical risks should be constantly monitored using the IMSAFE model. Similarly, the instructor should communicate  with the learner to establish a confidence level that will encourage learners to come forward to disclose their own aeromedical issues  well in advance of scheduled flights, so that they may be rescheduled if necessary.  

# Aircraft Risks  

The instructor   should   determine the aircraft’s   official airworthiness   status   before scheduled   flights   and   before conducting   the actual  preflight. Unless   instructing   in   their   own   aircraft, instructors   should   be familiar   with   the aircraft operator’s   procedures for reporting  and correcting discrepancies and review the current discrepancy report. Any questions regarding airworthiness status should be  resolved with maintenance personnel before conducting the preflight inspection. The instructor should consider involving the learner  in this process and should emphasize that it is intended to manage risk by reducing the likelihood and/or severity of potential hazards  and risks arising from failed equipment.  

# Environmental Risks  

Environmental risks are one of the most frequent causes of accidents. These notably include risks generated by weather, terrain, and  night operation hazards and additionally include airports, airspace, and other environmental factors. All these hazards and risks will  likely come into play at some point during the instruction process. Accordingly, instructors should emphasize accurate assessment and  mitigation of such risks when providing instruction.  

The instructor should involve the learner in every step of the assessment and mitigation process. For example, the weather may be  marginal VFR. If the scheduled dual instruction called for practicing stalls and slow flight, the instructor should coach the learner to  identify the risks involved in conducting stall practice under such conditions, such as inadvertently entering IMC or practicing stalls  at too low an altitude. The instructor and learner can discuss ways to mitigate the risk, such as changing the lesson plan to stay in the  traffic pattern, conducting a lesson in a flight simulation training device or ground school, or rescheduling the lesson altogether.  

# External Pressure Risks  

External pressures can create the most insidious of hazards and risks. Instructors should ease learner concerns about schedule  conflicts   with   events   in   their   professional and   personal lives. Instructors   should   be conscious   of   each   learner’s   schedule limitations  and other external factors that could affect their performance. Instructors should also emphasize the ability to make schedule changes  as needed, change training from an airplane to classroom instruction, or terminate a lesson early if the learner appears apprehensive  about time pressures or other external concerns.  

# Notes on Instructional Risk Management in the Flight Deck  

The instructor is involved with risk management on multiple levels, which include not only managing the risk of a particular phase of  flight or maneuver, but also teaching risk management and managing the risks of providing in-flight instruction. Some concepts an  instructor should bear in mind while teaching most maneuvers include:  

⦁  Identify relevant hazards systematically and keep track of hazards dur i ng maneuvering (the learner      manipulating controls may be a significant hazard).  ⦁  Avoid creating a hazard by attempting to teach something at an inappropriate time (e.g., discussing takeoff      technique while entering the runway, when attention should be devoted to aircraft control and ensuring that      the runway is clear) or at an inappropriate altitude (e.g., teaching stalls below a cloud layer, which does not      allow an adequate amount of altitude to recover).  ⦁  Discuss hazards and risk mitigation in detail during pre flight  and postflight.  ⦁  Prompt the learner to identify hazards in flight and on their own and to verbalize thought processes and risk      mitigations (e.g., while preparing to execute a ground reference maneuver, ask the      learner to identify potential collision hazards and a safe place to make an emergency landing).  

The following discussion contains examples of instructor considerations while providing in-flight instruction on various maneuvers.  Among other things, the examples demonstrate the extent to which instructional techniques and instructional risk management are  interconnected, and why a systematic, integrated approach to risk management provides safety.  

# Managing Risk while Teaching Takeoffs  

The time it takes for an aircraft to begin its takeoff and initiate a climb is only a matter of seconds. There may not be time to teach  effectively during the takeoff. Apart from introducing unnecessary hazards (e.g. ,   missing a radio transmission from tower),  the learner’s attention is placed almost entirely on trying to safely maneuver the aircraft. Any information an instructor is trying to  convey during the takeoff may not be heard or processed by the learner. The instructor should conduct the majority of their  teaching (e.g. airspeeds, pitch attitudes, visual references, flight control inputs, engine parameters) prior to contacting tower or  announcing their intentions on the CTAF at a non-towered airport. This will avoid over-stimulating the learner’s senses, help  maintain a sterile  flight deck , and support situational awareness and collision avoidance.  

When teaching a learner to take off, it is imperative that the instructor create realistic scenarios of takeoff types. The scenario should  not create hazards that result in the learner attempting to maintain an unsafe climb rate or excessive pitch attitude. An effective  scenario should mimic what a learner will encounter outside of flight training. For example, if the instructor wants to prompt the  learner to conduct a confined or obstacle clearance takeoff, the instructor could specify where an (imaginary) obstacle exists. The  point where the obstacle exists should be realistic. During soft-field takeoffs in an airplane, the instructor should monitor aircraft drift  while the learner    trying   to   remain   in   ground   effect. The instructor   should   not let the drift escalate   beyond   the learner’s   control and  should pay close attention to pitch attitude and airspeed throughout the maneuver.  

Insufficient spacing from preceding aircraft during takeoffs also creates various hazards. Some hazards include wake turbulence,  insufficient in-trail spacing, and insufficient separation from an aircraft approaching to land. The instructor ensures that there is  sufficient spacing from landing and departing aircraft prior to entering any space being used for departures and arrivals. This will also  help teach the learner sound decision making and risk management skills.  

# Managing Risk while Teaching Landings  

Many complex decisions are made during the landing phase. Novice learner pilots have little experience to rely on. Instructors  sometimes fall prey to teaching landings mechanically. Instead, it is necessary to convey problems and solutions (power, control, and  configuration changes) based on what is actually happening on that specific approach. When an instructor teaches mechanically, they  cause the learner to be ill-equipped to identify or manage constantly changing conditions. This teaching method may result in unstable  approaches and faulty landings. The instructor should prompt the learner on the current conditions and how to correct the situation to  maintain a stabilized approach. The decision on choosing aiming points and touchdown points should not be made mechanically  either.   It is   the instructor’s   responsibility   to   teach   the learner   how   to   pick   appropriate aiming   and   touchdown   points   based   on the type  of aircraft, the landing being attempted, the environment and conditions present, and the expected landing performance.  

Some of the same hazards associated while teaching takeoffs are also present while teaching landings. The instructor may want to  convey a lot of information while simultaneously verifying that the aircraft is being flown safely. This may cause a decrease in  attention to collision avoidance or loss of situational awareness. Excessive teaching and coaching on final approach may cause missed  radio transmissions from air traffic control or aircraft in the pattern. To avoid this, the instructor should only use concise prompting  on approach to landings with the learner.  

Certain landings present unique risks. The instructor teaches the appropriate pre-landing recon n aissance for unfamiliar landing areas  or uncontrolled fields. During landings in strong winds, the instructor should have the skill sufficient to deal with the wind  conditions. During a short-field or confined area landing, certain aircraft may fly at a slower approach speed. The instructor should be  aware of any risk associated with flight at slow speeds or any other condit i on that reduces safety margins. During all types of  approaches to landing, instructors need to remain aware of risks associated with a variety of learner errors. For example, if an airplane  pilot makes a   $180^{\circ}$   power-off accuracy approach and landing, the instructor should anticipate potential landing errors. Learners may  understand not to sacrifice a stable approach and a safe landing for the sake of accuracy, but they might not be ready to apply that  knowledge.  

# Chapter Summary  

Poor risk management contributes to many fatal accidents. Accordingly, instructors should emphasize and practice risk management  in all types of instruction, from primary to advanced training. Instructors should use accepted risk management tools to make training  more effective and consistent. Instructors should also use a building block approach to teaching risk management. Risks encountered  while giving instruction are similar to those that learners will encounter on operational flights, giving instructors the  opportunity  to  highlight risk management as a tool to be used for safe and enjoyable flying.

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Appendix B: Developing a Test Item Bank  

Developing a bank of test questions is difficult and time consuming. This task demands a mastery of the subject, an ability to write  clearly, and an ability to visualize realistic situations for use in developing problems. Because it is so difficult to develop good test  items, many instructors rely on commercially - prepared test materials. However, there are a few instructors who write their  own questions and maintain them in a database or a system of folders.  [Figure B-1]  

![](images/e940255f5607730c0fde5dfc1e989589bdde3455937f08e2c72468f911211ad5.jpg)  
Figure B-1.  A bank of test items makes it easier to construct new tests.  

# Written Test Items  Supply Type  

Supply type test items ask the learner to furnish a response in the form of a word, sentence, or paragraph. The supply-type item allows  the learner to organize knowledge. It shows an ability to express ideas and measures the learner’s generalized understanding   of a  subject. For example, the supply type item on a pre-solo knowledge test can be very helpful in determining whether the pilot-in­ training has adequate knowledge of procedures.  

There are several disadvantages of supply-type items. First, they cannot be graded with reliability. The same test graded by different  instructors could be assigned different scores. Even the same test graded by the same instructor on consecutive days might be  assigned a different score. Second, supply-type items require more time for the learner to complete and more time for the instructor to  grade.  

# Selection Type  

Selection type test items require the learner to select from two or more alternatives. There is a single correct response for each item. It  assumes all learners should learn the same thing, and relies on rote memorization of facts. Written tests made up of selection type  items are highly reliable, meaning that the results would be graded the same regardless of the learner taking the test or the person  grading it. In fact, this type of test item lends itself very well to machine scoring.  

Also, selection type items make it possible to directly compare learner accomplishment. For example, it is possible to compare the  performance of learners within one class to learners in a different class, or learners under one instructor with those under another  instructor. By using selection type items, the instructor can test on many more areas of knowledge in a given time than could be done  by requiring the learner to supply written responses. This increase in comprehensiveness can be expected to increase validity and  discrimination. Selection type tests are well adapted to statistical item analysis.  

# True-False  

The true-false test item consists of a statement followed by an opportunity for the learner to choose whether the statement is true or  false. This item type has a wide range of usage. It is well adapted for testing knowledge of facts and details, especially when there are  only two possible answers.  

The chief disadvantage is that true-false questions create the greatest probability of guessing. Also, true-false questions are more  likely to utilize rote memory than knowledge of the subject. In general, therefore, true-false questions are not considered valid (i.e.,  they do not measure what they are intended to measure).  

To use true-false questions, consider the following guidelines for effective test items:  

⦁  Include only one idea in each statement.  ⦁  Use original statements rather than verbatim text.  ⦁  Make the statement entirely true or entirely false.  ⦁  Avoid the unnecessary use of negatives, which tend to confuse the reader.  ⦁  Underline or otherwise emphasize the negative word(s) if they must be used.  ⦁  Keep wording and sentence structure as simple as possible.  ⦁  Make statements both definite and clear.  ⦁  Avoid the use of ambiguous words and terms (some, any, generally, most times, etc.)  ⦁  Use terms which mean the same thing to all learners whenever possible.  ⦁  Avoid absolutes (all, every, only, no, never, etc.) .  These words are known as determiners because they      provide clues to the correct answer.  ⦁  Avoid patterns in the sequence of correct responses because learners can often identify the patterns .  ⦁  . Make statements brief and approximately same length.  ⦁  State the source of a statement if it is controversial (sources have differing information).  

# Multiple Choice  

A multiple choice test item consists of two parts: the stem, which includes the question, statement, or problem; and a list of possible  responses. Incorrect answers are called distractors. When properly devised and constructed, multiple choice items offer several  advantages that make this type more widely used and versatile than either the matching or the true-false items.  [Figure B-2]  

Multiple choice test questions can help determine learner achievement, ranging from acquisition of facts to understanding, reasoning,  and ability to apply what has been learned. It is appropriate to use multiple choice when the question, statement, or problem has the  following characteristics:  

⦁  Built-in and unique solution, such as a specific application of laws or principles.  ⦁  Wording of the item is clearly limiting, so that the learner must choose the best of several offered      solutions rather than a universal solution.  ⦁  Several options that are plausible or even scientifically accurate.  ⦁  Several pertinent solutions, with the learner asked to identify the most appropriate solution.  

![](images/210514d6000e6823da0419d01d95dbaf8329f11bc4a5d74ad2553223a5ca757f.jpg)  
Figure B-2.  Sample multiple choice test item.  

Three major challenges are common in the construction of multiple choice test items. One is the development of a question or an item  stem that must be expressed clearly and without ambiguity. A second is that the statement of an answer or correct response cannot be  refuted. Finally, the distractors must be written in such a way that they are attractive to those learners who do not possess the  knowledge or understanding necessary to recognize the keyed response.  

A multiple choice item stem may take one of several basic forms:  

⦁  A direct question followed by several possible answers.  ⦁  An incomplete sentence followed by several possible phrases that complete the sentence.  ⦁  A stated problem based on an accompanying graph, diagram, or other artwork followed by the correct      response and the distractors.  

The learner may be asked to select the one correct choice or completion, the one choice that is an incorrect answer or completion, or  the one choice that is the best answer option presented in the test item.  

Beginning test writers find it easier to write items in the question form. In general, the form with the options as answers to a question  is preferable to the form that uses an incomplete statement as the stem. It is more easily phrased and is more natural for the learner to  read. Less likely to contain ambiguities, it usually results in more similarity between the options and gives fewer clues to the correct  response.  

When multiple choice questions are used, three or four alternatives are generally provided. It is usually difficult to construct more  than four convincing responses; that is, responses which appear to be correct to a person who has not mastered the subject matter.  Learners are not supposed to guess the correct option; they should select an alternative only if they know it is correct. An effective  means of diverting the learner from the correct response is to use common learner errors as distractors. For example, if writing a  question on the conversion of degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, providing alternatives derived by using incorrect formulas would  be logical, since using the wrong formula is a common learner error.  

Items intended to measure the rote level of learning should have only one correct alternative; all other alternatives should be clearly  incorrect. When items are to measure achievement at a higher level of learning, some or all of the alternatives should be acceptable  responses—but one should be clearly better than the others. In either case, the instructions given should direct the learner to select the  best alternative.  

To use multiple choice questions, consider the following guidelines for construction of effective test items:  

⦁  Make each item independent of every other item in the test. Do not permit one question to reveal, or      depend on, the correct answer to another question.  ⦁  Design questions that call for essential knowledge rather than for abstract background knowledge or      unimportant facts.  ⦁  State each question in language appropriate to the learners.  ⦁  Include sketches, diagrams, or pictures when they can present a situation more vividly than words. They      generally speed the testing process, add interest, and help to avoid reading difficulties and technical      language.  ⦁  When a negative is used, emphasize the negative word or phrase by underlining, bold facing, italicizing, or      printing in a different color.  ⦁  Avoid questions containing double negatives, which invariably cause confusion.  ⦁  Avoid trick questions, unimportant details, ambiguities, and leading questions that confuse and antagonize     the learner. If attention to detail is an objective, detailed construction of alternatives is preferable to trick     questions.  

# Stems  

When developing the stem of a multiple choice item, the following general principles should be utilized.  [Figure B-3]  

⦁  The stem should clearly present the central problem or idea. The function of the stem is to set the stage for      the alternatives that follow.  ⦁  The stem should contain only material relevant to its solution, unless the selection of what is relevant is      part of the problem.  ⦁  The stem should be worded in such a way that it does not give away the correct response. Avoid the use of      determiners, such as clue words or phrases.  ⦁  Put everything that pertains to all alternatives in the stem of the item. This helps to avoid repetitious      alternatives and saves time.  ⦁  Generally   avoid   using   “a”   or   “an” at the end   of   the stem.   They   may   give away   the correct choice.   Every       alternative should grammatically fit with the stem of the item.  

![](images/d897ba66727bda2e481fb570c780d8dc95bae28111b227c5aa204f81c02ba8e1.jpg)  
Figure B-3.  This is an example of a multiple choice question with a poorly written stem.  

# Alternatives  

The alternatives in a multiple choice test item are as important as the stem. They should be formulated with care; simply being  incorrect should not be the only criterion for the distracting alternatives.  

Popular distractors are:  

⦁  An incorrect response related to the situation and which sounds convincing.  ⦁  A common misconception.  ⦁  A statement which is true, but which does not satisfy the requirements of the problem.  ⦁  A statement that is either too broad or too narrow for the requirements of the problem.  

Research of instructor-made tests reveals that, in general, correct alternatives are longer than incorrect ones. When alternatives are  numbers, they should generally be listed in ascending or descending order of magnitude or length.  

# Matching  

A matching test item consists of two lists, which may include a combination of words, terms, illustrations, phrases, or sentences. The  learner matches alternatives in one list with related alternatives in a second list.  

In reality, a matching exercise is a collection of related multiple choice items. In a given period of time, more samples of a learner’s   knowledge usually can be measured with matching rather than multiple choice items. The matching item is particularly good for  measuring   a learner’s   ability   to   recognize relationships   and   to   make associations   between   terms,   parts,   words,   phrases,   clauses, or  symbols listed in one column with related items in another column. Matching reduces the probability of guessing correct responses,  especially if alternatives may be used more than once. The testing time can also be used more efficiently.  

The following guidelines help in the construction of effective matching test items:  

⦁  Give specific and complete instructions. Do not make the learner guess what is required.  ⦁  Test only essential information; never test unimportant details.  ⦁  Use closely related materials throughout an item. If learners can divide the alternatives into distinct groups,      the item is reduced to several multiple choice items with few alternatives, and the possibility of guessing is      distinctly increased.  ⦁  Make all alternatives credible responses to each element in the first column, wherever possible, to      minimize guessing by elimination.  ⦁  Use language the learner can understand. By reducing language barriers, both the validity and reliability of      the test is improved.  ⦁  Arrange the alternatives in some sensible order. An alphabetical arrangement is common.  

Matching-type test items are either equal column or unequal column. An equal column test item has the same number of alternatives  in each column. When using this form, always provide for some items in the response column to be used more than once, or not at all,  to preclude guessing by elimination. Unequal column type test items have more alternatives in the second column than in the first and  are generally preferable to equal columns.  

# Aviation Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-9)  Appendix C: Certificates, Ratings, and Endorsements  

# Flight Instructor Endorsements  

The authority and responsibility for flight instructors to endorse initial learner certificates, logbooks for solo and solo cross-country,  additional aircraft ratings, and flight privileges are outlined in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 61. In  addition, Advisory Circular (AC) 61-65,  Certification: Pilots and Flight and Ground Instructors , provides guidance for pilots, flight  instructors, ground instructors, and examiners on the certification standards, knowledge test procedures, and other requirements of 14  CFR part 61. By utilizing AC 61-65, the flight instructor does not omit any required endorsement for the rating sought, which ensures  standardization. It is important for the flight instructor to understand and use AC 61-65 in the certification process.  

Instructors should note that evaluations include an English language component. If the instructor doubts that a learner meets the FAA  English Language Standard (AELS), the instructor should not endorse the review or check as complete. The instructor may also reach  out to their local FSDO for assistance if the learner's continued operation could affect safety of the NAS. For further guidance on this  subject refer to FAA AC 60-28,  FAA English Language Standard for an FAA Certificate Issued Under 14 CFR  p arts 61, 63, 65, and  107 .  

The regulatory requirements for recording and logging time come from several different regulations that should be viewed together.  

⦁  14 CFR  part 61,   s ection 61.189 requires flight instructors to sign the logbook of each person to whom that  instructor has given flight training or ground training. That section also contains instructor requirements     for maintaining a record of endorsements given to  the   applicant.  

⦁  14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.193 authorizes instructors to make endorsements applicants need for various      certificates or ratings.  

⦁  Subparts of 14 CFR part 61 detail the training an applicant needs to log in order to qualify for a rating or  privilege. For example, 14 CFR part 61,  s ubpart C,  s ection 61.87(c)(1) requires a student pilot to receive and log  flight training in specific maneuvers and procedures.  

⦁  14 CFR  part 61,   s ection 61.51 details the information required for logbook entries.  

Flight instructors may also provide training and make logbook endorsements for pilots who are already certificated such as sport,  recreational, private, commercial, and instrument rated pilots, as well as for other flight instructors. Typical endorsements include but  are not limited to flight reviews, instrument proficiency checks, the additional training required for high performance, high altitude,  and tail wheel aircraft, and types of glider launches.  

Additional rating applicants (e.g., multiengine add-on, seaplane add-on, glider add-on, helicopter add-on) are rated pilots and not  considered student pilots nor do they need a student pilot certificate.  

⦁  In accordance with 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.31(d)(2), applicants without the appropriate rating require an      instructor's logbook endorsement prior to solo flight.  ⦁  14 CFR  part 61,   s ection 61.63 contains the requirement for an endorsement for an applicant prior to testing for an      added rating.  

Sample practical test endorsements are listed in AC 61-65. Any requirement for an applicant to receive and log a practical test  endorsement is cited in the relevant 14 CFR  s ubpart for each rating. For example, 14 CFR  part 61,   s ubpart F,  s ection 61.123(c)  requires an endorsement from an authorized instructor for an applicant for a commercial pilot certificate. Note that when giving an  endorsement, there is no rule that prevents an instructor from adding a requirement.  

The   flight   instructor   may   need   to   customize   the   endorsement   due   to   an   applicant’s   special   circumstances   or   changes   in   regulatory  requirements, but it is recommended all endorsements be worded as closely as possible to those in AC 61-65. At a minimum, the  flight instructor needs to cite the appropriate 14 CFR part 61 section that has been completed.  [Figure C-1]  

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors and designated pilot examiners (DPEs) rely on flight instructor recommendations  for learner or pilot applicant testing. These recommendations are accepted as evidence of qualification for certification and proof that  a review of the subject areas found to be deficient on the appropriate knowledge test has been given by the flight instructor.  Recommendations also provide assurance the applicant has had a thorough briefing on the Practical Test Standards (PTS), Airman  Certification Standards (ACS), and the associated knowledge areas, maneuvers, and procedures. If the flight instructor has trained and  prepared the applicant competently, the applicant should have no difficulty in passing the written and practical tests.

Figure C-1.  This is a sample logbook endorsement for pre-solo aeronautical knowledge.  

# Sport Pilot  

Many consider the advent of the sport pilot certification to be one of the most significant changes to the airman certification structure  to have occurred in over 50 years. Because of the growing cost to acquire the private pilot certification, more and more aviation  enthusiasts are considering the sport pilot as an alternative. Many aircraft already meet the light sport aircraft criteria, and many  manufacturers are now producing modern light sport aircraft. Flight instructors should review 14 CFR part 61, subparts J and K, for  the requirements for, and privileges and limitations of, the sport pilot certifications.  

14 CFR part 61,  s ubparts J and K, also describe the process for sport pilots and flight instructors with a sport pilot rating to add  additional category/class privileges. Light sport aircraft meet certain criteria, and a well-informed flight instructor should be  acquainted with the basic requirements.  

# FAA Forms 8710-1, 8610-2, and 8710-11  

Forms 8710-1, 8610-2, and 8710-11 are versions of the Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application. The instructor should ensure  the applicant is prepared for the test and has met all the regulatory requirements, including knowledge, proficiency, required  endorsements, and experience requirements before the application process. The applicant then either completes the 8710 or 8610  paper form by hand or uses the Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) electronic application system  available at  iacra.faa.gov/IACRA/Default.aspx .  

Whenever possible, applicants should use the IACRA system to make their application. The system provides internal checking, and  reduces the error rate. Any mistake or omission on a paper application form may cause a significant delay in the issuance of an FAA  certificate.  

# Instructor Records  

14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.189 requires the flight instructor to maintain a record that includes information on the type of  endorsement, the name of the person receiving the endorsement, and the date of the endorsement. This information may be kept  in a logbook or a separate document. For a knowledge or practical test endorsement, the record must include the kind of test, the  date, and the results. Records of endorsements must be maintained for at least 3 years.  

# Knowledge Tests  

14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.39(a)(1) requires that the applicant pass a knowledge test. When preparing an applicant for  certification (e.g., recreational, private, commercial or instrument), the flight instructor may provide the learner with an endorsement  to certify he or she has the required knowledge in accordance with 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.35. Bear in mind that some  additional ratings do not require a knowledge test. For information concerning additional aircraft certifications not requiring  knowledge tests, refer to AC 61-65. Flight instructors (not including sport pilot instructors) take an FOI knowledge test or an aircraft  subject matter test as required by 14 CFR  part 61, s ections 61.183(e) and 61.183(f). Added flight instructor ratings require a  knowledge test on subject matter ( part 61, s ection 61.183(f)), but the current added rating tests are shorter than the original flight  instructor certification test under  part 61, s ection 61.183(f) .  

Sport pilot applicants take a knowledge test required by 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.307(a). The regulation requires a logbook  endorsement from an authorized instructor in order to be able to take the knowledge test. 14 CFR  part   61,   s ection  61.405(a) requires a logbook endorsement from an authorized instructor for sport pilot instructor applicants. A Fundamentals of  Instructing test may also apply in accordance with  part 61, s ection 61.405(a)(1).  

If the applicant fails a knowledge test, the applicant needs an endorsement from an authorized instructor who gave additional training  in   accordance with 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.49(a) in order to retake the test. There is an unsigned endorsement provided on the  knowledge test report that may be utilized by the instructor.  

# Additional Training and Endorsements  

Flight instructors may provide training and endorsements for certificated pilots. AC 61-98, Currency Requirement and Guidance for  the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check, contains relevant information for certificated pilots and flight instructors for  flight review required by 14 CFR part 61,  s ection 61.56 or meeting recent flight experience requirements of  s ection 61.57.  

The AC includes general guidance in each of these areas, references to other related documents, and sample training plans that are  pertinent to this type of training.  

# Flight Reviews  

The requirements for a flight review are contained in 14 CFR part  61, section  61.56. The flight review is the aeronautical equivalent  of a regular medical checkup and ongoing health improvement program.  

Effective pilot refresher training should be based on specific objectives and standards. The objectives should include a thorough  checkout appropriate to the pilot certificate and aircraft ratings held, and the standards should be at least those required for the  issuance of that pilot certificate. Before beginning any training, the pilot and the instructor should agree fully on these objectives and  standards, and, as training progresses, the pilot should be kept appraised of progress toward achieving those goals.  

A flight review is an excellent opportunity for a  flight instructor   to review pilot decision-making  (ADM)  skills. To get the information  needed to evaluate ADM skills, including risk management, give the pilot multiple opportunities to make decisions and ask  questions about those decisions. For example, ask the pilot to explain why the alternate airport selected for a diversion exercise is  a safe and appropriate choice. What are the possible hazards, and what can the pilot do to mitigate them? Be alert to the pilot’s  information and automation management skills as well. For example, does the pilot perform regular “common sense crosschecks?”  For  more  ideas  on  generating  scenarios  that  teach  risk  management,  visit  www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/ handbooks manuals/aviation/pilot_risk/ .  

AC 61-98,  Currency Requirement and Guidance for the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check , provides guidance for  conducting a flight review.  An a ppendi x in   the   AC includes   a   sample flight review checklist, which contains portions of 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.56 and a sample endorsement. At the conclusion of a successful flight review, the logbook of the pilot should be  endorsed, as recommended.  [Figure C-2]  

![](images/7b527b7b5d9db7e668eedb5b2a19118ddb6a9bf692198d99a67c176e59a65731.jpg)  
Figure C-2.  This sample logbook endorsement is for completion of a flight review.  

# Instrument Proficiency Checks  

Instrument rated pilots who fail to meet instrument currency requirements of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$    part 61, s ection 61.57(c) for more than 6  calendar months are required by 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.57(d) to complete an instrument proficiency check (IPC) in  order to regain their instrument flying privileges. This does not apply to pilots meeting certain exceptions outlined in  s ection  61.57(e).  

14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.57(d) contains the requirements for an IPC. AC 61-98 contains guidance for the conduct of an  (IPC). The Instrument Rating Airman Certification Standards (ACS) provides additional IPC information.  

Aircraft and instrument ratings appropriate to the aircraft being flown need to be listed on the flight instructor’s instructor  certificate as indicated in 14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.57(d)(2).  

# Instructors as Certifying Officials for Student and Remote Certificates  

14 CFR  part 61, s ection 61.85(b) and  part 107, section  107.63(b)(1) allow instructors to accept a Student Pilot or Remote Pilot  Application. AC 61-141,  Flight Instructors as Certifying Officials for Student Pilot and Remote Pilot Applicants ,  has process  details for instructors and applicants.  

# Aircraft Checkouts/Transitions  

Certificated pilots depend on flight instructors for aircraft checkouts and transition training including high performance airplanes, tail  wheel airplanes, motor gliders, and aircraft capable of flight at high altitudes. The flight instructor who checks out and certifies the  competency of a pilot in an aircraft for which a type rating is not required by regulation accepts major responsibility for the safety of  future passengers. Many newer light airplanes are comparable in performance and complexity to transport airplanes. For these, the  flight instructor’s   checkout should   be at least as   thorough   as an   official type rating   practical test.   Other   considerations   include:  

⦁  AC 90-109, Transition to Unfamiliar Aircr aft, contains information help  plan the transition to any unfamiliar fixed-wing  airplanes, including type-certificated (TC) and/or experimental airplanes.  

For the conduct of an aircraft checkout, it is essential the flight instructor is fully qualified in the aircraft used and thoroughly familiar  with its operating procedures, AFM, and operating limitations. An instructor who does not meet the recent flight experience  prescribed by regulations for the aircraft concerned should not attempt to check out another pilot.  

The flight instructor should utilize a plan of action and a written training syllabus based on the appropriate ACS/PTS, and record in  the pilot’s   logbook   the exact extent of   any   checkout conducted.   This   record   serves a twofold   purpose: it benefits   the pilot concerned  and   it protects the flight instructor    questions   arise later.   In   the event the instructor   finds   a pilot’s   performance   to   be   insufficient to  allow sign-off, the pilot should be thoroughly debriefed on all problem areas and further instruction scheduled. In some cases, a  referral to another instructor may be appropriate.  

# Pilot Proficiency  

Professional flight instructors maintain knowledge and skill as instructors and as pilots. The flight instructor is at the leading edge of  the aviation   industry’s   efforts    improve aviation   safety   through   additional training.  

Instructors planning to take the ATP multiengine airplane knowledge test may refer to AC 61-138,  Airline Transport Pilot  Certification Training Program , for further guidanc e.

# Appendix D: Personal Minimums Checklist  

Pilot:  

Date Revised:  

Reviewed with: ,  (if applicable)  

# Your Personal Minimums Checklist—  

⦁  Is an easy-to-use, personal tool tailored to your level of skill, knowledge, and ability.  ⦁  Helps you control and manage risk by identifying even subtle risk factors.  ⦁  Allows you to fly with less stress and less risk. Practice “Conservatism Without Guilt.”  

Each item provides you with either a space to complete a personal minimum or a checklist item to think about. Spend  some quiet time completing each blank and consider other items that apply to your personal minimums. Give yourself  permission to choose higher minimums than those specified in the regulations, aircraft flight manuals, or other rules.  

# How To Use Your Checklist  

Use this checklist just as you would use one for your aircraft. Carry the checklist in your flight kit. Use it at home as you  start planning   a flight and again just before you   make your   final   decision   to fly. Be wary    you   have an   item   that’s   marginal  in any single risk factor category. But if you have items in more than one category, you may be headed for trouble. If you  have marginal items in two or more risk factors/categories, do not go!  

Periodically review and revise your checklist as your personal circumstances change, such as your proficiency, recency, or  training. You should never make your minimums less restrictive unless a significant positive event has occurred. However,  it is okay to make your minimums more restrictive at any time. And never make your minimums less restrictive when you  are planning a specific flight, or else external pressures will influence you.

Navigate.  To move between websites on the internet. Navigation is often accomplished by means of links or connections between  sites.  

Norm-referenced testing.  System of testing in which learners are ranked against the performance of other learners.  

Objectivity.  The singleness of scoring of a test; it does not reflect the biases of the person grading the test.  

Overhead question.  In the guided discussion method, a question directed to the entire group in order to stimulate thought and  discussion from the entire group. An overhead question may be used by an instructor as the lead-off question.  

Perceptions.  The basis of all learning, perceptions result when a person gives meaning to external stimuli or sensations. Meaning  derived   from   perception    influenced   by   an   individual’s   experience   and   many   other   factors.  

Performance-based objectives.  A statement of purpose for a lesson or instructional period that includes three elements: a description  of the skill or behavior desired of the learner, a set of conditions under which the measurement will be taken, and a set of criteria  describing the standard used to measure accomplishment of the objective.  

Personal computer-based aviation training device (PCATD).  A device which uses software which can be displayed on a personal  computer to replicate the instrument panel of an airplane. A PCATD must replicate a type of airplane or family of airplanes and meet  the virtual control requirements specified in Advisory Circular (AC) 61-126.  

Personality.  The embodiment of personal traits and characteristics of an individual that are set at a very early age and are extremely  resistant to change.  

Physical organism.  A   perception   factor   that describes a   person’s   ability    sense the world   around   them.  

Pilot error.  Pilot action/inaction or decision/indecision causing or contributing to an accident or incident.  

Poor judgment chain.  A series of mistakes that may lead to an accident or incident. Two basic principles generally associated with  the creation of a poor judgment chain are: (1) one bad decision often leads to another; and (2) as a string of bad decisions grows, it  reduces the number of subsequent alternatives for continued safe flight. Aeronautical decision-making is intended to break the poor  judgment chain before it can cause an accident or incident.  

Practical Test Standards (PTS).  An FAA published list of standards which must be met for the issuance of a particular pilot  certificate or rating. FAA inspectors and designated pilot examiners use these standards when conducting pilot practical tests and flight  instructors should use the PTS while preparing applicants for practical tests.  

Preparation.  The first step of the teaching process, which consists of determining the scope of the lesson, the objectives, and the goals  to be attained. This portion also includes making certain all necessary supplies are on hand. When using the telling-and-doing  technique of flight instruction, this step is accomplished prior to the flight lesson.  

Presentation.  The second step of the teaching process, which consists of delivering information or demonstrating the skills that make  up the lesson. The delivery could be by either the lecture method or demonstration-performance method. In the telling-and-doing  technique of flight instruction, this is the segment in which the instructor both talks about and performs the procedure.  

Pretest.  A test used to determine whether a learner has the necessary qualifications to begin a course of study. Also used to determine  the level of knowledge a learner has in relation to the material that will be presented in the course.  

Primacy.  A principle of learning in which the first experience of something often creates a strong, almost unshakable impression. The  importance to an instructor is that the first time something is demonstrated, it must be shown correctly since that experience is the one  most likely to be remembered by the learner.  

Problem-based learning.  Lessons in such a way as to confront learners with problems that are encountered in real life which force  them to reach real-world solutions.  

Psychomotor domain.  A grouping of levels of learning associated with physical skill levels which range from perception through set,  guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, and adaptation to origination.  

PTS.  See Practical Test Standards.  

Readiness.  A principle of learning where the eagerness and single-mindedness of a person toward learning affect the outcome of the  learning experience.  

Receiver.  In communication, the listener, reader, or learner who takes in a message containing information from a source, processes it,  reacts with understanding, and changes behavior in accordance with the message.  

Recency.  Principle of learning stating that things learned recently are remembered better than things learned some time ago. As time  passes, less is remembered. Instructors use this principle when summarizing the important points at the end of a lecture in order for  learners to better remember them.  

Relay question.  Used    response to   a learner’s   question,   the question    redirected    another   individual.  

Reliability.  The degree to which test results are consistent with repeated measurements.  

Repression.  Theory of forgetting proposing that a person is more likely to forget information which is unpleasant or produces anxiety.  

Response.  Possible answer to a multiple choice test item. The correct response is often called the keyed response, and incorrect  responses are called distractors.  

Reverse question.  Used   in   response to   a learner’s   question.   Rather   than   give a direct answer   to   the learner’s   query,   the instructor   returns the question to the same individual to provide the answer.  

Review and evaluation.  The fourth and last step in the teaching process, which consists of a review of all material and an evaluation  of the learners. In the telling-and-doing technique of flight instruction, this step consists of the instructor evaluating the performance  while the learner performs the required procedure.  

Rhetorical question.  Generally, a question asked for a purpose other than to obtain the information the question asks. For this  handbook’s   purpose,   a question   asked   to   stimulate group   thought. Normally   answered   by   the instructor,   it is   more commonly   used in  lecturing rather than in guided discussions.  

Risk elements in ADM.  Take into consideration the four fundamental risk elements: the pilot, the aircraft, the environment, and  external pressures.  

Risk management.  The part of the decision-making process which relies on situational awareness, problem recognition, and good  judgment to reduce risks associated with each flight.  

Rote learning.  A basic level of learning in which the learner has the ability to repeat back something learned, with no understanding  or ability to apply what was learned.  

Scenario-based training (SBT).  Training method that uses a highly structured script of real-world experiences to address aviation  training objectives in an operational environment.  

Selection-type test items.  Test items requiring the learner to choose from two or more alternatives provided. True-false, matching,  and multiple choice type questions are examples of selection type test items.  

Self-concept.  A perception factor that ties together how people feel about themselves with how well they receive experiences.  

Sensory register.  That portion   of   the brain   which   receives input from   the five senses. The individual’s   preconceived   concept of   what  is important determines how the register prioritizes the information for passing it on to the rest of the brain for action.  

Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM).  The art/science of managing all the resources (both onboard the aircraft and from  outside sources) available to a single pilot (prior and during flight) to ensure that the successful outcome of the flight is never in doubt.  

Sites.  Internet addresses which provide information and often are linked to other similar sites  

Situational awareness.  The accurate perception and understanding of all the factors and conditions within the four fundamental risk  elements that affect safety before, during, and after the flight.  

Skill knowledge.  Knowledge reflected in motor or manual skills and in cognitive or mental skills that manifests itself in the doing of  something.  

Skills and procedures.  The procedural, psychomotor, and perceptual skills used to control a specific aircraft or its systems. They are  the stick and rudder or airmanship abilities that are gained through conventional training, are perfected, and become almost automatic  through experience.  

Source.  In communication, the sender, speaker, transmitter, or instructor who composes and transmits a message made up of symbols  which are meaningful to listeners and readers.  

Stem.  The part of a multiple choice test item consisting of the question, statement, or problem.  

Stress management.  The personal analysis of the kinds of stress experienced while flying, the application of appropriate stress  assessment tools, and other coping mechanisms.  

Supply-type test item.  Question in which the learner supplies answers as opposed to selecting from choices provided. Essay or fill-in­ the-blank-type questions are examples of supply-type test items.  

Symbols.  In communication, simple oral and visual codes such as words, gestures, and facial expressions which are formed into  sentences, paragraphs, lectures, or chapters to compose and transmit a message that means something to the receiver of the  information.  

Task.  Knowledge area, flight procedure, or maneuver within an area of operation in a practical test standard.  

Taxonomy of educational objectives.  A systematic classification scheme for sorting learning outcomes into three broad categories  (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor) and ranking the desired outcomes in a developmental hierarchy from least complex to most  complex.  

Teaching.  Instructing, training, or imparting knowledge or skill; the profession of someone who teaches.  

Teaching lecture.  An oral presentation that is directed toward desired learning outcomes. Some learner participation is allowed.  

Test.  A set of questions, problems, or exercises for determining whether a person has a particular knowledge or skill.  

Test item.  A question, problem, or exercise that measures a single objective and requires a single response.  

Time and opportunity.  A perception factor in which learning something is dependent on the individual having the time to sense and  relate current experiences in context with previous events.  

Traditional assessment.  Written testing, such as multiple choice, matching, true-false, or fill-in-the-blank.  

Training course outline.  Within a curriculum, describes the content of a particular course by statement of objectives, descriptions of  teaching aids, definition of evaluation criteria, and indication of desired outcome.  

Training media.  Any physical means that communicates an instructional message to learners.  

Training syllabus.  A step-by-step, building block progression of learning with provisions for regular review and evaluations at  prescribed stages of learning. The syllabus defines the unit of training, states by objective what the learner is expected to accomplish  during the unit of training, shows an organized plan for instruction, and dictates the evaluation process for either the unit or stages of  learning.  

Transfer of learning.  The ability to apply knowledge or procedures learned in one context to new contexts  

Transition training.  An instructional program designed to familiarize and qualify a pilot to fly types of aircraft not previously flown,  such as tail wheel aircraft, high performance aircraft, and aircraft capable of flying at high altitudes.  

True-false test item.  A test item consisting of a statement followed by an opportunity for the learner to determine whether the  statement is true or false.  

Understanding.  A basic level of learning at which a learner comprehends or grasps the nature or meaning of something.  

Usability.  The functionality of tests.  

#  

Validity.  The extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure.  

Virtual reality (VR).  A form of computer-based technology that creates a sensory experience allowing a participant to believe and  barely distinguish a virtual experience from a real one. VR uses graphics with animation systems, sounds, and images to reproduce  electronic versions of real-life experience.  

#  

Working or short-term memory.  The portion of the brain that receives information from the sensory register. This portion of the  brain can store information in memory for only a short period of time. If the information is determined by an individual to be  important enough to remember, it must be coded in some way for transmittal to long-term memory.
