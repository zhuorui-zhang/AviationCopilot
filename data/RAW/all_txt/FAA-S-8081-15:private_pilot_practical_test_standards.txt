# Introduction  

# General Information  

The FAA has developed the PTS for use by FAA inspectors and evaluators when conducting the practical  test. Instructors should use this PTS when preparing applicants for practical tests. Applicants should be  familiar with this PTS and refer to these standards during their training.  

Throughout this PTS the following titles: ASI, pilot examiner (other than administrative pilot examiners),  TCE; or chief instructor, assistant chief instructor, or check instructor of pilot school holding examining  authority, will be referred to as an evaluator.  

Information considered directive in nature is described in this PTS in terms such as “shall” and “must,”  indicating the actions are mandatory. Guidance information is described in terms such as “should” and  “may,” indicating the actions are desirable or permissive, but not mandatory.  This PTS is available for download, in PDF format, from  www.faa.gov .  

Comments regarding this PTS may be emailed to  acsptsinquiries@faa.gov.  

# PTS Concept  

14 CFR part 61 specifies the subject areas in which knowledge and skill must be demonstrated by the  applicant before the issuance of a certificate. The practical test standards contain the Areas of Operation  and specific Tasks in which competency shall be demonstrated. The FAA will revise this PTS whenever  it is determined that changes are needed in the interest of safety. Per 14 CFR part 61, section 61.43,  adherence to the practical test standards is mandatory.  

# PTS Description  

This PTS includes the Areas of Operation and Tasks for the issuance of an initial Private Pilot Certificate  and for the addition of category and/or class ratings to that certificate.  

Areas of Operation are phases of the practical test arranged in a logical sequence within this standard.  They begin with Preflight Preparation and end with Postflight Procedures. The evaluator may conduct  the practical test in any sequence that will result in a complete and efficient test. However, the ground  portion of the practical test must be accomplished before the flight portion.  

Tasks are titles of knowledge areas, flight procedures, or maneuvers appropriate to an Area of Operation.  

Note is used to emphasize special considerations required in the Area of Operation or Task.  

Reference identifies the publication(s) that describe(s) the Task. Descriptions of Tasks are not included  in the standards because this information can be found in the current issue of the listed reference.  Publications other than those listed may be used for references if their content conveys substantially the  same meaning as the referenced publications.  

These practical test standards are based on the following reference list:

# Use of the PTS  

The PTS has been designed to evaluate competency in both knowledge and skill.  

The FAA requires that all practical tests be conducted in accordance with the appropriate PTS.  Private  pilot applicants must be evaluated in all Tasks included in the Areas of Operation of the appropriate  practical test standard unless otherwise noted.  

An applicant who holds at least a Private Pilot Certificate seeking an additional rotorcraft category rating  and/or class rating at the private pilot level will be evaluated in the Areas of Operation and Tasks listed  in the Additional Rating Task Table. At the discretion of the evaluator, an evaluation of the applicant's  competence in the remaining Areas of Operation and Tasks may be conducted.  

If the applicant holds two or more category or class ratings at least at the private level, and the rating  table indicates differing required Tasks, the “least restrictive” entry applies. For example, if “All” and  “None” are indicated for one Area of Operation, the “None” entry applies. If “B” and “B, C” are indicated,  the “B” entry applies.  

In preparation for each practical test, the evaluator must develop a written “plan of action” for each  practical test. The “plan of action” is a tool, for the sole use of the evaluator, to be used in evaluating the  applicant.  The plan of action need not be grammatically correct or in any formal format. The plan of  action must contain all of the required Areas of Operation and Tasks and any optional Tasks selected by  the evaluator. The “plan of action” must incorporate one or more scenarios that will be used during the  practical test.  

The evaluator should try to include as many of the Tasks into the scenario portion of the test as possible,  but maintain the flexibility to change due to unexpected situations as they arise and still result in an efficient  and valid test. Any Task selected for evaluation during a practical test is to be evaluated in its entirety.  

The evaluator is not required to follow the precise order in which the Areas of Operation and Tasks appear  in this book. The evaluator may change the sequence or combine Tasks with similar objectives to have  an orderly and efficient flow of the practical test. For example, lost procedures may be combined with  radio navigation. The evaluator's “plan of action” should include the order and combination of Tasks to  be demonstrated by the applicant in a manner that will result in an efficient and valid test.  

The evaluator is expected to use good judgment in the performance of simulated emergency procedures.   The use of the safest means for simulation is expected. Consideration must be given to local conditions  (both meteorological and topographical), at the time of the test, as well as the applicant's, workload, and  the condition of the aircraft used. If the procedure being evaluated would jeopardize safety, it is expected  that the applicant will simulate that portion of the maneuver.  

# Special Emphasis Areas  

Evaluators must place special emphasis upon areas of aircraft operation considered critical to flight  safety. Among these are:  

1.  positive aircraft control;  2.  procedures for positive exchange of flight controls (who is flying the aircraft);  3.  collision avoidance;  4.  wake turbulence avoidance;  5.  runway incursion avoidance;  6.  CFIT;  7.  wire strike avoidance;  8.  ADM and risk management;  9.  checklist usage;  10.  TFRs;  11.  SUA;  12.  Aviation security;  13.  SRM and CRM; and  14.  other areas deemed appropriate to any phase of the practical test.  

Although these areas may not be specifically addressed under each Task, they are essential to flight  safety and will be evaluated during the practical test.  In all instances, the applicant’s actions will relate  to the complete situation.  

# Practical Test Prerequisites  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.39 and subpart E, provide practical test and certification prerequisites.  

# Aircraft and Equipment Required for the Practical Test  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.45, provides requirements for aircraft and equipment for the practical test.  

# Evaluator Responsibility  

The evaluator must determine that the applicant meets FAA  AELS .  An applicant for an FAA certificate or  rating must be able to communicate in English in a discernible and understandable manner with ATC,  pilots, and others involved in preparing an aircraft for flight and operating an aircraft in flight. This  communication may or may not involve radio communications. An applicant for an FAA certificate issued  in accordance with 14 CFR part 61 who cannot hear or speak due to a medical deficiency may be eligible  for an FAA certificate with specific operational limitations.  For additional information, reference AC 60- 28, FAA English Language Standard for an FAA Certificate Issued Under 14 CFR parts 61, 63, 65, and  107, as amended.  

If the applicant's ability to meet the FAA AELS comes into question before starting the practical test, the  evaluator will not begin the practical test. An evaluator who is not an ASI 1  will check the box,  Referred to  FSO for Aviation English Language Standard Determination,  located on the bottom of page 2 of the  applicant’s FAA Form 8710-1, Application for an Airman Certificate and/or Rating The evaluator will refer  the applicant to the appropriate FSO.  

If the applicant's ability to meet the FAA AELS comes into question after the practical test begins, an  evaluator who is not an ASI will discontinue the practical test and check the box,  Referred to FSO for  Aviation English Language Standard Determination , on the application. The evaluator will also issue a  Notice of Disapproval of Application, FAA Form 8060-5 with the comment “Does Not Demonstrate FAA  AELS” in addition to any unsatisfactory Task(s).  

In either case, the evaluator must complete and submit the application file through normal application  procedures and notify the appropriate FSO of the referral.  

The evaluator conducting the practical test is responsible for determining that the applicant meets the  acceptable standards of knowledge and skill of each Task within the appropriate practical test standard.  Since there is no formal division between the “oral” and “skill"   portions of the practical test, this becomes  an ongoing process throughout the test. Oral questioning, to determine the applicant’s knowledge of  Tasks and related safety factors, should be used judiciously at all times, especially during the flight portion  of the practical test.  

Evaluators must test to the greatest extent practicable the applicant's correlative abilities rather than mere  rote enumeration of facts throughout the practical test.  

If the evaluator determines that a Task is incomplete, or the outcome uncertain, the evaluator may require  the applicant to repeat that Task, or portions of that Task.  This provision has been made in the interest  of fairness and does not mean that instruction, practice, or the repeating of an unsatisfactory task is  permitted during the certification process.  

Throughout the flight portion of the practical test, the evaluator must evaluate the applicant's use of visual  scanning and collision avoidance procedures.  

# Flight Instructor Responsibility  

An appropriately rated flight instructor is responsible for training the private pilot applicant to acceptable  standards in all subject matter areas, procedures, and maneuvers included in the Tasks within the  appropriate PTS.  

Because of the impact of their teaching activities in developing safe, proficient pilots, flight instructors  should exhibit a high level of knowledge, skill, and the ability to impart that knowledge and skill to  students. Additionally, the flight instructor must certify that the applicant is able to perform safely as a  private pilot and is competent to pass the required practical test.  

Throughout the applicant's training, the flight instructor is responsible for emphasizing the performance  of effective visual scanning, collision avoidance, and runway incursion avoidance procedures.  These  areas are covered, in part, in AC 90-48, Pilots’ Role in Collision Avoidance; FAA-H-8083-25, Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge; and the Aeronautical Information Manual.  

# Satisfactory Performance  

14 CFR part 61, section 61.43(a), describes the satisfactory completion of the practical test for a  certificate or rating.  

# Unsatisfactory Performance  

If, in the judgment of the examiner, the applicant does not meet the standards of performance of any  Task performed, the associated Area of Operation is failed and, therefore, the practical test is failed. 14  CFR part 61, section 61.43(c) – (f) provides additional unsatisfactory performance requirements and  parameters.  

1. Any action or lack of action by the applicant that requires corrective intervention by the evaluator  to maintain safe flight.   2. Failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques to clear the area before and while  performing maneuvers.   3. Consistently exceeding tolerances stated in the Objectives.   4. Failure to take prompt corrective action when tolerances are exceeded.  

When a disapproval notice is issued, the evaluator will record the applicant's unsatisfactory  performance in terms of Area of Operations and specific Task(s) not meeting the standard appropriate  to the practical test conducted.  The Area(s) of Operation/Task(s) not tested and the number of  practical test failures must also be recorded.  If the applicant fails the practical test because of a special  emphasis area, the Notice of Disapproval must indicate the associated Task (e.g.: Area of Operation  VIII, Settling-With-Power, failure to use proper collision avoidance procedures).  

# Letter of Discontinuance  

When a practical test is discontinued for reasons other than unsatisfactory performance (e.g., equipment  failure, weather, or illness), FAA Form 8700-1, Airman Certificate and/or Rating Application, and, if  applicable, the AKTR, is to be returned to the applicant. The evaluator at that time prepares, signs, and  issues a Letter of Discontinuance to the applicant. The Letter of Discontinuance should identify the Areas  of Operation and their associated Tasks of the practical test that were successfully completed. The  applicant should be advised that the Letter of Discontinuance must be presented to the evaluator when  the practical test is resumed, and made part of the certification file.  

# Aeronautical Decision-Making, Risk Management, Crew Resource Management, and Single-Pilot  Resource Management  

Throughout the practical test, the evaluator must assess the applicant’s ability to use sound aeronautical  decision-making procedures in order to identify hazards and mitigate risk. The evaluator must accomplish  this requirement by developing scenarios that incorporate and combine Tasks appropriate to assessing  the applicant’s risk management in making safe aeronautical decisions. For example, the evaluator may  develop a scenario that incorporates weather decisions and performance planning.  

In assessing the applicant’s performance, the evaluator should take note of the applicant’s use of CRM  and, if appropriate, SRM. CRM/SRM is the set of competencies that includes situational awareness,  communication skills, teamwork, task allocation, and decision-making within a comprehensive framework  of SOP. SRM specifically refers to the management of all resources onboard the aircraft, as well as  outside resources available to the single pilot.  

# Applicant's Use of Checklists  

Throughout the practical test, the applicant is evaluated on the use of an appropriate checklist. Proper  use is dependent on the specific Task being evaluated. The situation may be such that the use of the  checklist while accomplishing the elements of the Objective would be either unsafe or impractical,  especially in a single-pilot operation. In this case, a review of the checklist after the elements have been  accomplished would be appropriate. Division of attention and proper visual scanning would be considered  when using a checklist.  

# Use of Distractions During Practical Tests  

Numerous studies indicate that many accidents have occurred when the pilot has been distracted during  critical phases of flight. To evaluate the pilot's ability to utilize proper control technique while dividing  attention both inside and/or outside the cockpit, the evaluator should cause a realistic distraction during  the flight portion of the practical test to evaluate the applicant's ability to divide attention while maintaining  safe flight.  

# Positive Exchange of Flight Controls  

During flight, there must always be a clear understanding between pilots of who has control of the aircraft.  Prior to flight, a briefing should be conducted that includes the procedure for the exchange of flight  controls. A positive three-step process, subsequently described, in the exchange of flight controls  between pilots is a proven procedure and one that is strongly recommended.  

When one pilot wishes to give the other pilot control of the aircraft, he or she will say, “You have the flight  controls.” The other pilot acknowledges immediately by saying, “I have the flight controls.” The first pilot  again says, “You have the flight controls.” When control is returned to the first pilot, follow the same  procedure. A visual check is recommended to verify that the exchange has occurred. There should never  be any doubt as to who is flying the aircraft.
