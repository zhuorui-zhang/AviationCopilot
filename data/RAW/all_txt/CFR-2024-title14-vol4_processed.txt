EXPLANATION

The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its
revision date (in this case, January 1, 2024), consult the ``List of CFR
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting
requirements.

PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of
the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried.
Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date
in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected
(LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to
the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult
previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to
2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and
not dropped in error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)).
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force
of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which
approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of
material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative
process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001,
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in
this volume.
An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within
that volume.

[[Page vii]]

The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form.
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in
the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

(a) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that
any intentional failure by the holder to comply with any provision of
Statute or any order, rule, or regulation issued thereunder or any term,
condition, or limitation of such certificate shall be a failure to
comply with the terms, conditions, and limitations of the certificate
within the meaning of section 41110 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII even
though the failure to comply occurred outside the territorial limits of
the United States, except to the extent that such failure shall be

carriage of mail or otherwise.
(d) An all-cargo air transportation certificate shall confer no
right to carry passengers, other than cargo attendants accompanying a

scheduled, charter, contract, or other transportation of cargo, by air,
within that geographical scope.

(c) Participation in the Montreal Agreement, whether by signing the
Agreement, filing a signed counterpart to it under Sec.  203.3, or by
operation of law under Sec.  203.5, shall constitute a special agreement
between the carrier and its passengers as a condition of carriage that a
liability limit of not less than $75,000 (U.S.) shall apply under
Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention for passenger injury and death.
Such participation also constitutes a waiver of the defense under
Article 20(1) of the Convention that the carrier was not negligent.

authority (including exemptions) by the Department or operating in air
transportation shall be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of
Agreement 18900 as fully as if that air carrier or foreign air carrier
had in fact filed a properly executed counterpart to that Agreement and

Sec.  204.6  Certificated and commuter air carriers proposing
a change in operations, ownership, or management which is not
substantial.

Carriers proposing to make a change which would not substantially
affect their operations, management, or ownership, such as certificated
carriers applying for additional authority which would not substantially
change their operations, will be presumed to be fit and need not file
any information relating to their fitness at time of the change.
However, if the Department concludes, from its own analysis or based on
information submitted by third parties, that such change may bring the
carrier's fitness into question, the Department may require the
applicant carrier to file additional information.


<r05>
Sec.  204.7  Revocation for dormancy.

(a) An air carrier that has not commenced any type of air
transportation operations for which it was found fit, willing, and able
within one year of the date of that finding, or an air carrier that, for
any period of one year after the date of such a finding, has not
provided any type of air transportation for which that kind of finding
is required, is deemed no longer to continue to be fit to provide the
air transportation for which it was found fit and, accordingly, its
authority to provide such air transportation shall be revoked.
(b) An air carrier found fit which commences operations within one
year after being found fit but then ceases operations, shall not resume
operations without first filing all of the data required by Sec.  204.3
at least 45 days before it intends to provide any such air
transportation. Such filings shall be addressed to the Docket Operations
Office, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE.,
Washington, DC 20590. The Department will entertain requests for
exemption from this 45-day advance filing requirement for good cause
shown. If there has been no change in fitness data previously formally
filed with the Department, the carrier shall file a sworn statement to
that effect signed by one of its officers. The carrier may contact the
Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain which data are
already available to the Department and need not be refiled. A carrier
to which this paragraph applies shall not provide any air transportation
for which it is required to be found fit, willing, and able until the
Department decides that the carrier continues to be fit, willing, and
able to perform such air transportation. During the pendency of the
Department's consideration of a data submission under this paragraph,
the expiration period set out in paragraph (a) of this section shall be
stayed. If the decision or finding by the Department on the issue of the
carrier's fitness is favorable, the date or that decision or finding
shall be the date considered in applying paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) For purposes of this section, the date of a Department decision
or finding shall be the service date of the Department's order
containing such decision or finding, or, in cases where the Department's
decision or finding is made by letter, the date of such letter.

[[Page 17]]

(d) For purposes of this section, references to operations and to
the providing of air transportation shall refer only to the actual
performance of flight operations under an operating certificate issued

<r05>
Sec.  205.2  Applicability.

These rules apply to all U.S. direct air carriers, including

[Doc. No. 47939, 57 FR 40100, Sept. 2, 1992]


<r05>
Sec.  205.3  Basic requirements.

(a) A U.S. or foreign direct air carrier shall not engage in air
transportation unless it has in effect aircraft accident liability
insurance coverage that meets the requirements of this part for its air
carrier or foreign air carrier operations. The minimum amounts of
coverage required by this part may be provided either by insurance
policies or by self-insurance plans. The currently effective policy of
insurance or complete plan for self-insurance shall be available for
inspection by the Department at the carrier's principal place of
business. The current certificate of insurance or a summary of the
complete self-insurance plan on file with the Department, as required by
Sec.  205.4, shall be available for public inspection at the carrier's
principal place of business.
(b) For purposes of this part, a certificate of insurance is one or
more certificates showing insurance by one or more insurers (excluding
reinsurers) of currently effective and properly endorsed policies of
aircraft accident liability insurance in compliance with this part. When
more than one such insurer is providing coverage, the limits and types
of liability assumed by each insurer (excluding reinsurers) shall be
clearly stated in the certificate of insurance. Insurance policies and
self-insurance plans named in a certificate of insurance that
accompanies an application for initial registration or for operating
authority shall become effective not later than the proposed starting
date for air carrier operations as shown in the application.
(c) The certificate of insurance shall list the types or classes of
aircraft, or the specific aircraft by FAA or foreign government
registration number, with respect to which the policy of insurance
applies, or shall state that the policy applies to all aircraft owned or
operated by the carrier in its air transportation operations. With
respect to certificates of insurance that list aircraft by government
registration number, the policy or self-insurance plan shall state that,
while an aircraft

[[Page 18]]

owned or leased by the carrier and declared in the policy is withdrawn
from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, or servicing, such
insurance as is provided by the policy or plan for that aircraft shall
apply also to another aircraft of similar type, horsepower, and seating
capacity, whether or not owned by the insured, while temporarily used as
a substitute aircraft.
(d) Each certificate of insurance shall be signed by an authorized
officer, agent, or other representative of the insurer or the insurance
broker.
(e) Insurance coverage to meet the requirements of this part shall
be obtained from one or more of the following:
(1) An insurer licensed to issue aircraft accident liability
policies in any State, Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States,
or in the District of Columbia;
(2) Surplus line insurers named on a current list of such insurers
issued and approved by the insurance regulatory authority of any State,
Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States or of the District of
Columbia; or
(3) Insurers licensed or approved by a foreign government.


This requirement may be waived by the Department in the public interest.

[ER-1253, 46 FR 52577, Oct. 27, 1981, as amended by Doc. No. 47939, 57
FR 40100, Sept. 2, 1992]


<r05>
Sec.  205.4  Filing of evidence of insurance.

(a) A U.S. or foreign air carrier shall file a certificate of
insurance or a complete plan for self-insurance with the Department.
Each carrier shall ensure that the evidence of aircraft accident
liability coverage filed with the Department is correct at all times.
The Department will normally notify the carrier within 20 days of
receipt if the certificate or plan does not meet the requirements of
this part. Certificates of Insurance shall be filed on OST Form 6410 for
U.S. air carriers, including commuter air carriers and air taxi
operators, and OST Form 6411 for foreign air carriers, including
Canadian air taxi operators. The Department may return the certificate
or self-insurance plan to the carrier if it finds for good cause that
such certificate or plan does not show adequate evidence of insurance
coverage under this part. Forms may be obtained from and should be filed
with the Department at the addresses specified in paragraph (c) of this
section. Forms may also be obtained on the Internet at https://
www.transportation.gov/policy/aviation-policy/licensing/US-carriers.
(b) If the coverage is by type or class of aircraft or by specific
aircraft, endorsements that add previously unlisted aircraft or aircraft
types or classes to coverage, or that delete listed aircraft, types, or
classes from coverage, shall be filed with the Department at the
addresses specified in paragraph (c) of this section not more than 30
days after the effective date of the endorsements. Aircraft shall not be
listed in the carrier's operations specifications with the FAA and shall
not be operated unless liability insurance coverage is in force.
(c) Certificates of insurance and endorsements required in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be submitted to the
Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Program
Management Branch, AFS-260, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC
20591. For those air carriers that have a mailing address in the State
of Alaska, the forms shall be submitted to the Department of
Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Alaskan Region
Headquarters, AAL-230, 222 West 7th Avenue, Box 14, Anchorage, Alaska
99513. For Canadian air taxis, the forms shall be submitted to the
Department of Transportation, Special Authorities Division, X-46, 1200
New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590.

<r05>
Sec.  205.5  Minimum coverage.

(a) Insurance contracts and self-insurance plans shall provide for
payment on behalf of the carrier, within the specific limits of
liability in this section, of all sums that the carrier

[[Page 19]]

shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, excluding any
deductible in the policy, for bodily injury to or death of a person, or
for damage to the property of others, resulting from the carrier's
operation or maintenance of aircraft in air transportation provided
under its authority from the Department.
(b) U.S. and foreign direct air carriers, including commuter air
carriers but excluding U.S. air taxi operators and Canadian charter air
taxi operators, shall maintain the following coverage:
(1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily
injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants,
other than passengers, and for damage to property, with minimum limits
of $300,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of
$20,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, except that for
aircraft of not more than 60 seats or 18,000 pounds maximum payload
capacity, carriers need only maintain coverage of $2,000,000 per
involved aircraft for each occurrence.
(2) Any such carrier providing air transportation for passengers
shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (b)(1) of this
section, maintain aircraft accident liability insurance coverage for
bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with minimum limits of
$300,000 for any one passenger, and a total per involved aircraft for
each occurrence of $300,000 times 75 percent of the number of passenger
seats installed in the aircraft.
(c) U.S. air taxi operators registered under part 298 shall maintain
the following coverage:
(1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily
injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants,
other than passengers, with minimum limits of:
(i) $75,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of
$300,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, and
(ii) A limit of a least $100,000 for each occurrence for loss of or
damage to property.
(2) U.S. air taxi operators carrying passengers in air
transportation shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph
(c)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability insurance
coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with
minimum limits of $75,000 for any one passenger, and a total per
involved aircraft for each occurrence of $75,000 times 75 percent of the
number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
(d) Canadian charter air taxi operators registered under part 294 of
this chapter shall maintain the following coverage:
(1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily
injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants,
other than passengers, and for damage to property, with a minimum
coverage of $75,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a
total of $2,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, except
that Canadian charter air taxi operators operating aircraft of more than
30 seats or 7,500 pounds maximum cargo payload capacity, and a maximum
authorized takeoff weight on wheels not greater than 35,000 pounds shall
maintain coverage for those aircraft of $20,000,000 per involved
aircraft for each occurrence.
(2) Canadian charter air taxi operators engaging in passenger
charter air service under part 294 of this chapter shall, in addition to
the coverage required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, maintain
aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of
aircraft passengers, with a minimum coverage of $75,000 for any one
passenger and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of
$75,000 times 75 percent of the total number of passenger seats
installed in the aircraft.
(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the
carrier may be insured for a combined single limit of liability for each
occurrence. The combined single-limit coverage must be not less than the
combined required minimums for bodily injury and property damage
coverage plus, if the aircraft is used in passenger service, the
required total passenger coverages stipulated in paragraph (b) of this
section for U.S. and foreign direct air carriers and commuter carriers,
paragraph

[[Page 20]]

(c) of this section for U.S. air taxi operators, or paragraph (d) of
this section for Canadian charter air taxi operators. \1\ The single-
limit liability policy for the required aircraft accident liability
coverage may be provided by a single policy or by a combination of
primary and excess policies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\1\ For example: the minimum single limit of liability acceptable
for any aircraft in air taxi passenger service with 16 passenger seats
would be computed on the basis of limits set forth in paragraph (c) as
follows: 16 x .75 equals 12; 12 x $75,000 equals $900,000; $900,000 plus
$300,000 (nonpassenger liability per occurrence) plus $100,000 (property
damage per occurrence) equals $1,300,000. The latter amount is the
minimum in which a single-limit liability policy may be written.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(f) The liability coverage shall not be contingent upon the
financial condition, solvency, or freedom from bankruptcy of the
carrier. The limits of the liability for the amounts required by this
part shall apply separately to each occurrence. Any payment made under
the policy or plan because of any one occurrence shall not reduce the
coverage for payment of other damages resulting from any other
occurrence.

<r05>
Sec.  205.6  Prohibited exclusion of coverage.

(a) No warranty or exclusion in the policy or plan or in any
endorsement or amendment to the policy or plan, nor any violation of the
policy or plan by the carrier, shall remove the liability coverage
required by this part, except as specifically approved by the
Department. This requirement shall not limit the right of insurers to
recover from the carrier for amounts paid.
(b) A policy of insurance or a self-insurance plan required by this
part shall not contain the following exclusions:
(1) Violation of any safety-related requirement imposed by statute
or by rule of a government agency.
(2) Liability assumed by the carrier under an agreement to raise the
liability limitations of the Warsaw Convention by signing a counterpart
to an agreement of carriers (such as the Montreal Agreement, 18900,
signed May 13, 1966, agreeing to a limit on the carrier's liability for
injury or death of passengers of $75,000 per passenger), or any
amendment to such agreement that may be approved by the Department and
to which the carrier becomes a party.

<r05>
Sec.  205.7  Cancellation, withdrawal, modification, expiration,
or replacement of insurance coverage.

(a) Each policy of aircraft accident liability insurance and plan
for self insurance shall specify that it shall remain in force, and may
not be replaced, canceled, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce
the minimum standards set forth in this part, or to change the extent of
coverage, by the insurer or the carrier, nor expire by its own terms, in
regard to coverage for the carrier in its common carrier operations in
air transportation, until 10 days after written notice by the insurer
(in the event of replacement, by the retiring insurer), or by the
insurer's representative, or by the carrier, describing the change, to
the Department at the addresses specified in Sec.  205.4(c), which 10-
day notice period shall start to run from the date such notice is
actually received at the Department. For purposes of this part, a policy
will not be considered to have expired if the same insurer renews its
coverage without reduction in the extent of coverage or amounts of
coverage, and without a break in coverage, whether or not a new policy
is issued, and notice to the Department is not required in that event.
If the coverage being changed is by type or class of aircraft or by
specific aircraft, endorsements adding or deleting specific aircraft or
types or classes of aircraft, for which prior notice would be required
by this paragraph, shall be filed in accordance with Sec.  205.4(b), and
prior notice of the change need not be given under this paragraph.
(b) The requirements of this section shall not apply if the policy
contains a lesser time period for cancellation in a war risk exclusion.
If the war risk exclusion is activated by the insurer, the

[[Page 21]]

insurer or its representative shall immediately notify the Department.

<r05>
Sec.  205.8  Cargo liability disclosure statement.

Every direct U.S. or foreign air carrier providing air cargo service
in air transportation shall give notice in writing to the shipper, when
a shipment is accepted, of the existence or absence of cargo liability
insurance, and the limits on the extent of its liability, if any. The
notice shall be clearly and conspicuously included on or attached to all
of its rate sheets and airwaybills.

not significantly impair the economic viability of existing services
providing essential air transportation to any eligible Freely Associated
State point within the scope of part 272 of this chapter, or

charter it conducts, meets the applicable requirements of this chapter.
(e) The certificated or foreign air carriers shall require full
payment of the total charter price, including payment for the return
portion of a round trip, or the posting of a satisfactory bond for full
payment, prior to the commencement of any portion of the air
transportation, provided, however, that in the case of a passenger
charter for less than the entire of an aircraft, the carrier shall
require full payment of the total charter price, including payment for
the return portion of a round trip, from the charterers not less than 10
days prior to the commencement of any portion of the transportation, and
such payment shall not be refundable unless the charter is canceled by
the carrier or unless the carrier accepts a substitute charterer for one
which has canceled a charter, in which case the amount paid by the
latter shall be refunded. For the purpose of this section, payment to
the carrier's depository bank, as designated in the charter contract,
shall be deemed payment to the carrier.
(f) A certificated or foreign air carrier operating a U.S.-
originating passenger charter shall be responsible to return to his or
her point of origin any passenger who purchased round trip
transportation on that charter and who was transported by that carrier
on his or her outbound flight; except that this provision shall not
apply in cases where the return transportation is to be provided by
another certificated or foreign air carrier.
(g) A certificated or foreign air carrier may not perform any
charter flight for which a statement of authorization is required under
Sec.  212.9 until one has been granted by the Department. In addition,
if a foreign air carrier is required to obtain a statement of
authorization under paragraph (e) of that section, neither it, not any
charter operator, or any other person shall advertise or sell any
passenger charter services except those that have been specifically
authorized by the Department.
(h) A certificated air carrier may not operate charters where such
operations would result in a substantial change in the scope of its
operations within the meaning of part 204 of this chapter.
(i) A certificated air carrier may not limit its baggage liability
for interstate charter flights except as set forth in part 254 of this
chapter.
(j) A certificated air carrier may not, except as set forth in part
121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 121), limit the
availability, upon reasonable request, of air transportation and related
services to a person who may require help from another person in
expeditiously moving to an emergency exit for evacuation of an aircraft.
(k) A certificated air carrier holding a certificate to conduct only
cargo operations may not conduct passenger charters.
(l) A certificated air carrier may not perform any charter in
interstate commerce within the State of Alaska.
(m) A foreign air carrier may operate charters in foreign air
transportation only to the extent authorized by its foreign air carrier
permit under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or exemption authority under 49 U.S.C.
40109, and only to the extent to which such operations are consistent
with the provisions of any applicable bilateral aviation undertaking.

whose business is the formation of groups for transportation or
solicitation or sale of transportation services, for the purpose of

the bona fide members of an eligible chartering organization, and their
immediate families (spouse, children, and parents). All printed

10-point or larger type--
Some of the Federal rules that protect against tour changes and loss

efforts to assure that passengers transported meet the eligibility
requirements of this section. The certificated or foreign air carrier

agents, from requiring prospective passengers to pay nominal reservation
fees that are duly refundable by the casino, hotel, or cruise line
before the flight, establish a minimum line-of-credit at the casino,
hotel, or cruise line, bring (but not necessarily spend) a specified
minimum amount of money, or meet other requirements that do not place
them in financial jeopardy; nor does it preclude the casino, hotel, or

charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on
behalf of such participant);
(ii) If used in combination with a depository agreement, protect
charter participant payments (including those for ground accommodations
and services) and assure the certificated or foreign air carrier's
contractual and regulatory responsibilities to charter participants in
the amount of at least $10,000 times the number of flights, except that
the amount need not be more than $200,000. The liability of the securer
with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter
price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
(c) The Department reserves the right to limit or prohibit the
operation of direct sales Public Charters by a foreign air carrier upon
a finding that such action is necessary in the public interest.


<r05>
Sec.  212.8  Protection of customers' payments.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no
certificated air carrier or foreign air carrier shall perform any
charter trip (other than a cargo charter trip) originating in the United
States or any Overseas Military Personnel Charter trip, as defined in
part 372 of this chapter, nor shall such carrier accept any advance
payment in connection with any such charter trip, unless there is on
file with the Department a copy of a currently effective agreement made
between said carrier and a designated bank, by the terms of which all
sums payable in advance to the carrier by charterers, in connection with
any such trip to be performed by said carrier, shall be deposited with
and maintained by the bank, as escrow holder, the agreement to be
subject to the following conditions:
(1) The charterer (or its agent) shall pay the carrier either by
check or money order made payable to the depository bank. Such check or
money order and any cash received by the carrier from a charterer (or
its agent) shall be deposited in, or mailed to, the bank no later than
the close of the business day following the receipt of the check or
money order or the cash, along with a statement showing the name and
address of the charterer (or its agent); provided, however, that where
the charter transportation to be performed by a carrier is sold through
a travel agent, the agent may be authorized by the carrier to deduct its
commission and remit the balance of the advance payment to the carrier
either by check or money order made payable to the designated bank.
(2) The bank shall pay over to the carrier escrowed funds with
respect to a specific charter only after the carrier has certified in
writing to the bank that such charter has been completed; provided,
however, that the bank may be required by the terms of the agreement to
pay over to the carrier a specified portion of such escrowed funds, as
payment for the performance of the outbound segment of a round-trip
charter upon the carrier's written certification that such segment has
been so completed.

[[Page 33]]

(3) Refunds to a charterer from sums in the escrow account shall be
paid directly to such charterer its assigns. Upon written certification
from the carrier that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall turn
over directly to the charterer or its assigns all escrowed sums (less
any cancellation penalties as provided in the charter contract) which
the bank holds with respect to such canceled charter, provided however,
that in the case of a split charter escrowed funds shall be turned over
to a charterer or its assigns only if the carrier's written
certification of cancellation of such charter includes a specific
representation that either the charter has been canceled by the carrier
or, if the charter has been canceled by the charterer, that the carrier
has accepted a substitute charterer.
(4) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter
flight.
(5) As used in this section the term ``bank'' means a bank insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
(b) The escrow agreement required under paragraph (a) of this
section shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims
against the escrow may be made only with respect to the non-performance
of air transportation.
(c) The carrier may elect, in lieu of furnishing an escrow agreement
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to furnish and file with the
Department a surety bond with guarantees to the United States Government
the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips)
originating in the United States and of all overseas military personnel
charter trips, as defined in part 372 of this chapter, to be performed,
in whole or in part, by such carrier pursuant to any contracts entered
into by such carrier. The amount of such bond shall be unlimited. \1\
Claims under the bond may be made only with respect to the non-
performance of air transportation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

\1\ While the face amount of the bond is unlimited, claims are
limited to amounts that are paid to carrier for U.S.-originating
passenger charter flights that carrier fails to perform or to refund.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) The bond permitted by this section shall be in the form set
forth as the appendix to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a
bonding or surety company--
(1) Which is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty)
with a general policyholders' rating of ``A'' or better or
(2) Which is listed in the U.S. Department of Treasury's notice
listing companies holding Certificates of Authority as acceptable
sureties on Federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies,
published in the Federal Register on or about July 1. The bonding or
surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that
type in the State in which there is located the office or usual
residence of the agency designated by the carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103
to receive service of notices, process and other documents issued by or
filed with the Department of Transportation. For the purposes of this
section the term ``State'' includes any territory or possession of the
United States, or the District of Columbia. If the bond does not comply
with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to
provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the
Department will notify the certificated or foreign air carrier by
registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond.
Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time limit set forth
in the notification, no amounts payable in advance by customers for the
subject charter trips shall be accepted by the carrier.
(e) The bond required by this section shall provide that unless the
charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is
unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after cancellation of a
charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are
secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability
under the bond to such charterer for such charter trip. The contract
between the carrier and the charterer shall contain notice of this
provision.


<r05>
Sec.  212.9  Prior authorization requirements.

(a) Certificated air carriers shall obtain a statement of
authorization for

[[Page 34]]

each long-term wet lease to a foreign air carrier.
(b) Foreign air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization
for each:
(1) Fifth-, sixth- and/or seventh-freedom charter flights to or from
the United States;
(2) Long-term wet lease;
(3) Charter flight for which the Department specifically requires
prior authorization under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; or
(4) Part charter.
(c) The Department may issue blanket statements of authorization to
foreign air carriers to conduct fifth freedom charters. The standards
for issuing such blanket authorizations shall be those stated in Sec.
212.11. The Department may revoke any authority granted under this
paragraph at any time without hearing.
(d) The Department may at any time, with or without hearing, but
with at least 30 days' notice, require a foreign air carrier to obtain a
statement of authorization before operating any charter flight. In
deciding whether to impose such a requirement, the Department will
consider (but not be limited to considering) whether the country of the
carrier's nationality:
(1) Requires prior approval for third or fourth freedom charter
flights by U.S. air carriers;
(2) Has, over the objection of the U.S. Government, denied rights of
a U.S. air carrier guaranteed by a bilateral agreement; or
(3) Has otherwise impaired, limited, or denied the operating rights
of U.S. air carriers, or engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or
restrictive practices with respect to air transportation services to,
from, through, or over its territory.
(e) The Department, in the interest of national security, may
require a foreign air carrier to provide prior notification or to obtain
a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight over
U.S. territory.

<r05>
Sec.  212.11  Issuance of statement of authorization.

(a) The Department will issue a statement of authorization if it
finds that the proposed charter flight, part charter, or wet lease meets
the requirements of this part and that it is in the public interest.
Statements of authorization may be conditioned or limited.
(b) In determining the public interest the Department will consider
(but not be limited to) the following factors:
(1) The extent to which the authority sought is covered by and
consistent with bilateral agreements to which the United States is a
party.
(2) The extent to which an applicant foreign air carrier's home
country (and, in the case of a long-term wet lease, the lessee's home
country) deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of substantial
reciprocity.

[[Page 36]]

(3) Whether the applicant or its agent has previously violated the
provisions of this part.
(4) Where the application concerns a long-term wet lease:
(i) Whether the lessor (applicant) or its agent or the lessee
(charterer) or its agent has previously violated the provisions of the
Department's charter regulations.
(ii) Whether, because of the nature of the arrangement and the

bilateral agreement.
(iii) To what extent the lessor owns and/or controls the lessee, or
is owned and/or controlled by the lessee.
(c) The Department will submit any denial of an authorization
specifically required of a foreign air carrier under Sec.  212.9(d) to
the President of the United States at least 10 days before the proposed
departure. The denial will be subject to stay or disapproval by the
President within 10 days after it is submitted. A shorter period for
Presidential review may be specified by the Department where the
application for authorization is not timely or properly filed. Denial of
a late-filed application need not be submitted to the President. For the
purposes of this paragraph, an application filed by a foreign air
carrier under Sec.  212.9(d) to conduct a cargo charter will be
considered as timely filed only if it is filed at least 30 calendar days
before the proposed flight, notwithstanding the 10-day filing
requirement for cargo charters in Sec.  212.10(d)(3).

applications for statements of authorization in its Weekly List of
Applications Filed. Interested persons may upon request obtain copies of

Sec.  212.12  Waiver.

The Department may grant a waiver of any of the provisions of this
part upon a finding that such waiver is in the public interest. A
certificated or foreign air carrier may request a waiver by filing a
written application with the Department, citing the specific provision
to be waived and providing justification for such waiver.


<r05>
Sec. Appendix A to Part 212--Certificated or Foreign Air Carrier's
Surety Bond Under Part 212 of the Regulations of the Department of
Transportation (14 CFR Part 212)

Know all persons by these presents, that we __________ (Name of
certificated or foreign air carrier) of __________, (City) __________
(State or Country) as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and
__________ (name of Surety) a corporation created and existing under the
laws of the State of ________ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called
Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in
an unlimited amount, as required by 14 CFR 212.8, for which payment,
well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors,
administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly
by these presents.
Whereas the principal, a certificated air carrier holding a
certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under 49 U.S.C.
41102, or a foreign air carrier holding a foreign air carrier permit
issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C.
40109 authorizing that foreign air carrier to engage in charter trips in
foreign air transportation, is subject to rules and regulations of the
Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of
charterers of civil aircraft and has elected to file with the Department
of Transportation such a bond as will guarantee to the United States
Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo
charter trips) originating in the United States and of all Overseas
Military Personnel Charters, as defined in 14 CFR part 372, to be
performed, in whole or in part, by such certificated or foreign air
carrier pursuant to contracts entered into by such carrier after the
execution date of this bond, and
Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal
with rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating
to security for the protection of charterer of civil aircraft for
charter trips (other than cargo charters) originating in the United
States or of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips and shall inure
to the benefit of any and all such charterers to whom the Principal may
be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.
Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the
Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to such charterer any sum or
sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the
Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill,

[[Page 37]]

and carry out all contracts made by the Principal while this bond is in
effect for the performance of charter trips (other than cargo charter
trips) originating in the United States and of Overseas Military
Personnel Charter trips, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise
to remain in full force and effect.
The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment
or succession of payments hereunder in any specified amount. The surety
agrees to furnish written notice to the Department of Transportation
forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by
said Surety under this bond.
This bond is effective the ___ day of ________, ____, 12:01 a.m.,
standard time at the address of the Principal as stated herein and shall
continue in force until terminated as hereinafter provided. The
Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written
notice to the Department of Transportation at its office in Washington,
D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual
receipt of said notice by the Department. The Surety shall not be liable
hereunder for the payment of the damages hereinbefore described which
arise as the result of any contracts for the performance of air
transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of
this bond becomes effective, as herein provided, but such termination
shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for the payment
of any such damages arising as the result of contracts for the
performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after
the termination of this bond becomes effective. Liability of the Surety
under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charterer who
shall within sixty (60) days after the cancellation of a charter trip
with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by
this bond give written notice of claim to the certificated or foreign
air carrier, or, if it is unavailable, to the Surety, and all liability
on this bond for such charter trip shall automatically terminate sixty
(60) days after the termination date thereof except for claims filed
within the time provided herein.
In witness whereof, the said Principal and Surety have executed this
instrument on the ___ day of ________, ____.

<r05>
Sec.  213.3  Filing and approval of schedules.

(a) In the absence of provisions to the contrary in the permit and
of Department action pursuant to this section, a foreign air carrier may
determine the schedules (including type of equipment used) pursuant to
which it engages in transportation between points in the United States
and points outside thereof.
(b) In the case of a foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air
transportation which is not the subject of an air transport agreement
between the United States and the government of the holder, the
Department, if it finds that the public interest so requires, may with
or without hearing order the foreign air carrier to file with it within
7 days after service of such order, an original and three copies of any
or all of its existing schedules of service between any point in the
United States and any point outside thereof, and may require such
carrier thereafter to file an original and three copies of any proposed
schedules of service between such points at least 30 days prior to the
date of inauguration of such service. Such schedules shall contain all
schedules of aircraft which are or will be operated by such carrier
between each pair of points set forth in the order, the type of
equipment used or to be used, the time of arrival and departure at each
point, the frequency of each schedule, and the effective date of any
proposed schedule.
(c) In the case of any foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air
transportation which is the subject of an air transport agreement
between the United States and the government of the holder, the
Department may with or without hearing issue an order, similar to that
provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, if it makes the findings
provided for in that subsection and, in addition, finds that the
government or aeronautical authorities of the government of the holder,
over the objections of the U.S. Government, have: (1) Taken action which
impairs, limits, terminates, or denies operating rights, or (2)
otherwise denied or failed to prevent the denial of, in whole or in
part, the fair and equal opportunity to exercise the operating rights,
provided for in such air transport agreement, of any U.S. air carrier
designated thereunder with respect to flight operations to, from,
through, or over the territory of such foreign government.
(d) The carrier may continue to operate existing schedules, and may
inaugurate operations under proposed schedules 30 days after the filing
of such schedules with the Department, unless the Department with or
without hearing issues an order, subject to stay or disapproval by the
President of the United States within 10 days after adoption, notifying
the carrier that such operations, or any part of them, may be contrary
to applicable law or may adversely affect the public interest. If the
notification pertains to a proposed schedule, service under such
schedule shall not be inaugurated; if the notification pertains to
existing schedules, service under such schedules shall be discontinued
on the date specified in the Department's order. Such date shall be not
less than ten days after adoption of the Department's order unless
affirmative Presidential approval is obtained at an earlier date.

[[Page 39]]

(e) No petitions for reconsideration may be filed with respect to
Department orders issued pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this
section. Nevertheless, if the Department serves a notification under
paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier may make application to the
Department for approval of any or all existing or proposed schedules,
pursuant to the provisions of Sec.  213.5. The Department may with or
without hearing withdraw, in whole or in part, its notification at any
time and may permit existing or proposed schedules to be operated for
such period or periods as the Department may determine.
(f) The date of service on a foreign air carrier of orders and
notifications pursuant to this section shall be the date of mailing
thereof, by certified or registered mail, to the agent designated by the
foreign air carrier pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 46103 or, if the foreign air
carrier has failed to designate an agent, the date of mailing by
registered air mail to the foreign air carrier's home office.

Any violation by the foreign air carrier of applicable provisions of
Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the U.S. Code or of orders, rules or
regulations issued thereunder, or of the terms, conditions or
limitations applicable to the exercise of the privileges granted by the
permit shall constitute a failure to comply

[[Page 40]]

with the terms, conditions and limitations of such permit: Provided,
That upon a showing that a violation of a provision not mandatorily
prescribed by law resulted from the observance by the holder of an
obligation, duty or liability imposed by a foreign country, the
Department may excuse the violation.

<r05>
Sec.  215.1  Applicability.

This part applies to all certificated air carriers, commuter air
carriers, and foreign direct air carriers and to initial and amended
applications for authority, applications for certificate or permit
transfers or reissuances, and registration of business names.

[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15925, Apr. 16, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  215.2  Purpose.

This part sets rules under which direct air carriers may use the
names in their operating authorizations and change those names. It
further provides for notification to air carriers that may be affected
by the use by other air carriers of the same or similar names. Its
purpose is to place the responsibility for resolving private disputes
about the use of similar names with the air carriers involved, through
recourse to the trade names statutes

[[Page 41]]

and the courts. These rules do not preclude Department intervention or
enforcement action should there be evidence of a significant potential
for, or of actual, public confusion.


<r05>
Sec.  215.3  Use of name.

In holding out to the public and in performing air transportation
services, a direct air carrier or foreign direct air carrier subject to
this part shall use only the name in which its operating authorization
is issued or trade name is registered, and shall not operate or hold out
to the public in a name not acknowledged by the Department to be so
registered. Minor variations in the use of this name, including
abbreviations, contractions, initial letters, or other variations of the
name that are identifiable with the authorized name, are permitted.
Slogans and service marks shall not be considered names for the purpose
of this part, and their use is not restricted.

<r05>
Sec.  215.4  Change of name or use of trade name.

(a) Registrations. Any air carrier subject to this part that desires
to change the name in which its operating authorization has been issued,
or to use a trade name, or to obtain initial operating authority must
register the name with the Department. The Department will construe any
application for initial, reissued, or transferred authority as
containing a ``registration'' of the intended name. A separate name
registration document need not be filed. A carrier registering use of a
trade name, without seeking reissuance of its underlying certificate
commuter or foreign air carrier permit or exemption authority, must file
a statement that complies with Sec. Sec.  302.3 and 302.4 of this
chapter registering its intended name with the Air Carrier Fitness
Division if it is a U.S. certificated or commuter carrier, or within the
Foreign Air Carrier Licensing Divisionif it is a foreign air carrier.
(b) Montreal Agreement. Each registration under this section shall
be accompanied by three copies of a counterpart to the Montreal
Agreement (Agreement 18900) (OST Form 4523) signed by the carrier using
the proposed name. Upon arrival of the application, the Department will
place a copy of the signed OST form 4523 in Docket DOT-OST-1995-236.

(Reporting and recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (b) were approved
by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3024-0064.)

<r05>
Sec.  215.5  Procedure in case of similarity of names.

The Department will compare the proposed name in any registration
filed under this part or in an application for new, reissued, or
transferred authority with a list of names used by existing
certificated, commuter and foreign direct air carriers. The Department
will notify the applicant of any other certificated, foreign or commuter
carriers that may have an identical or similar name. The registrant must
then notify those carriers of its registration. The notification will
identify the applicant and state its proposed name or the name
requested, area of operation or proposed area of operation, type of
business, and other pertinent matters. The registrant must then file a
certificate of service of the notification with the Department.


<r05>
Sec.  215.6  Acknowledgment of registration.

After completion of the filing and notification requirements of this
part, the Department may acknowledge the registration by notice in the
action granting the application for initial operating authority,
transfer, or reissuance or by separate notice in the case of use of a
trade name. Non-action under this provision shall not be construed as an
adjudication of any rights or liabilities.

<r05>
Sec.  216.1  Definitions.

(a) As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires:
Blind sector traffic means revenue traffic, carried by a foreign air
carrier on a flight operating in air transportation, which is enplaned
at one foreign point and deplaned at another foreign point, where at
least one of such points is not named as a terminal or intermediate
point in the carrier's applicable foreign air carrier permit.

Note: This definition shall not be deemed to include the carriage of
authorized beyond homeland traffic (i.e., traffic carried between a
point named in a carrier's foreign air carrier permit and a point beyond
a homeland terminal point authorized under such permit).

Revenue traffic means persons, property or mail carried for
compensation or hire.
(b) Terms defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102 have the meaning expressed in
such definitions.

<r05>
Sec.  216.2  Applicability.

This part sets forth the requirements applicable to foreign air
carriers for obtaining a Special Authorization from the Department with
respect to any deviation from an authorized foreign air transportation
route for the purpose of commingling blind sector traffic with air
transportation traffic carried pursuant to a foreign air carrier permit
issued by the Department. The deviation by a foreign air carrier from
its authorized route for the purpose of combined carriage to or from the
United States of nonrevenue or other traffic, the carriage of which does
not constitute engaging in foreign air transportation, is governed by
the provisions of part 375 of this chapter.

[ER-525, 33 FR 692, Jan. 19, 1968, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-
0140, 84 FR 15926, Apr. 16, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  216.3  Prohibition.

No foreign air carrier shall carry any blind sector traffic, as
defined in this part, on any flight operating in air transportation
pursuant to the authority of a foreign air carrier permit issued under
49 U.S.C. 41301, unless the combined carriage of such traffic has been
specifically authorized by such permit, or by a Special Authorization
issued under Sec.  216.4.

[ER-525, 33 FR 692, Jan. 19, 1968, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-
0140, 84 FR 15926, Apr. 16, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  216.4  Special authorizations.

(a) Applications. Any foreign air carrier may apply to the
Department for a Special Authorization, as required by this part, for
the carriage of blind sector traffic on a particular flight, series of
flights, or for a specified or indefinite period of time between
specified points. Applications shall be submitted directly to the
Department, addressed to the attention of the Director, Office of
International Aviation. One original and two copies in conformity with
the requirements of Sec. Sec.  302.3(b) and 302.4 (a) and (b) of this
chapter shall be filed. The applications shall contain a proper
identification of the applicant; the flight or flights upon which it is
proposed to carry such blind sector traffic, including routing,
nontraffic stops, and dates or duration of the authority sought; a full
description of such traffic, and points between which such traffic will
be carried; information or documentation as to whether the country of
which the applicant is a national grants reciprocal privileges to U.S.
carriers; and the reasons for requesting such authorization together
with such additional information as will establish that the grant of
such authority will otherwise be in the public interest. Such additional
information as may be specifically requested by the Department shall
also be furnished.
(b) Service. Applications shall be served upon each direct U.S. air
carrier certificated to engage in individually

[[Page 43]]

ticketed or waybilled foreign air transportation over any portion of the
route to which the application pertains, and on such other persons as
the Department may require, and proof of such service shall accompany
the application as provided in Sec.  302.7 of this chapter. Notice of
such applications shall also be published in the Department's Weekly
List of Applications Filed.
(c) Memoranda in support or opposition. Any interested person may
file a memorandum in support of or in opposition to the grant of an
application. Such memorandum shall set forth in detail the reasons why
it is believed that the application should be granted or denied and
shall be accompanied by such data, including affidavits, which it is
desired that the Department consider. Copies of the memorandum shall be
served upon the applicant. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed
to preclude the Department from granting or denying an application when
the circumstances so warrant without awaiting the filing of memoranda in
support of or in opposition to the application.
(d) Time for filing. (1) Applications seeking authority to engage in
blind sector operations for a period of 3 months or longer, shall be
submitted at least 60 days in advance of the proposed commencement of
such operations. Memoranda in response to such an application shall be
submitted within 15 days after the date of filing thereof.
(2) Applications seeking authority to engage in blind sector
operations for a period less than three months shall be filed at least
20 days in advance of the proposed commencement of such operations, and
memoranda in response thereto within 7 days after the date of filing
thereof: Provided, That the Department may consider late filed
applications upon a showing of good cause for failure to adhere to this
requirement.
(e) General procedural requirements. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the provisions of part 302, subpart A, of this chapter shall
apply to the extent applicable.
(f) Issuance of Special Authorization. A Special Authorization
authorizing the carriage of blind sector traffic will be issued only if
the Department finds that the proposed carriage is fully consistent with
applicable law and this part, and that grant of such authority would be
in the public interest. The application may be granted or denied in
whole or in part without hearing, and a Special Authorization made
subject to any conditions or limitations, to the extent that such action
is deemed by the Department to be in the public interest. Special
Authorizations are not transferable.
(g) Nature of the privilege conferred. A Special Authorization
issued pursuant to this section shall constitute a privilege conferred
upon a carrier, which may be enjoyed only to the extent that its
continued exercise remains in the interest of the public. Accordingly,
any Special Authorization issued pursuant to this section may be
revoked, suspended, amended or restricted without hearing.

Sec. Appendix A to Part 217--Instructions to Foreign Air Carriers for
Reporting Traffic Data on Form 41 Schedule T-100(f)

(a) General instructions.
(1) Description. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) provides flight stage
data covering both passenger/cargo and all cargo operations in scheduled
and nonscheduled services. The schedule is used to report all flights
which serve points in the United States or its territories as defined in
this part.
(2) Applicability. Each foreign air carrier holding a section 41302
permit or exemption authority shall file Schedule T-100(f).
(3) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the
Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting
and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation
Statistics' Director of Airline Information.
(4) Filing period. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) shall be filed monthly
and is due at the Department thirty (30) days following the end of the
reporting month to which the data are applicable.

[[Page 48]]

(b) Preparation of Form 41 Schedule T-100(f):
(1) Explanation of nonstop segments and on-flight markets. There are
two basic categories of data, one pertaining to nonstop segments and the
other pertaining to on-flight markets. For example, the routing (A-B-C-
D) consists of three nonstop segment records A-B, B-C, and C-D, and six
on-flight market records A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, and C-D.
(2) Guidelines for reporting a nonstop segment. A nonstop segment is
reported when one or both points are in the United States or its
territories. These data shall be merged with that for all of the other
reportable nonstop operations over the same segment. Nonstop segment
data must be summarized by aircraft type, under paragraph (h)(1) of this
appendix, and class of service, paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this appendix.
(3) Rules for determining a reportable on-flight market. On-flight
markets are reportable when one or both points are within the U.S., with
the following exceptions: (i) Do not report third country to U.S.
markets resulting from flight itineraries which serve a third country
prior to a homeland point in flights passing through the homeland bound
for the U.S.; and (ii) do not report U.S. to third country markets
resulting from itineraries serving third country points subsequent to a
homeland point in flights outbound from the U.S. and passing through the
homeland. In reporting data pertaining to these two exceptions, the
traffic moving to or from the U.S. relating to the applicable prior or
subsequent third countries (referred to as ``behind'' or ``beyond''
traffic) is to be combined with the applicable foreign homeland gateway
point, just as though the traffic were actually enplaned or deplaned at
the homeland gateway, without disclosure of the actual prior or
subsequent points. Applicable flights are illustrated in examples (6)
and (7) under paragraph (c) of this appendix.
(c) Examples of flights. Following are some typical flight
itineraries that show the reportable nonstop segment and on-flight
market entries. The carrier's homeland is the key factor in determining
which on-flight markets are reportable.
(1) SQ flight  11 LAX--NRT--SIN. This is an example of a flight
with an intermediate foreign country. It is not necessary to report
anything on the NRT--SIN leg.

(3) LB flight  902 LPB-VVI-MAO-CCS-MIA. This flight serves two
homeland points and two different foreign countries before terminating
in the U.S. Nonstop segment information is required only for the nonstop
segment involving a U.S. point. On-flight market information is required
in 4 of the 10 markets, LPB-MIA and VVI-MIA, since these involve
homeland and U.S. points; MAO-MIA is necessary to show traffic carried
into the U.S., and CCS-MIA for the same reason, and also because in all
cases where a nonstop segment entry is required, a corresponding on-
flight market entry must also be reported.

(d) Provisions to reduce paperwork:
(1) Nonstop Segment Entries. The flight stage data applicable to
nonstop segment entries must be summarized to create totals by aircraft
equipment type, within service class, within pairs-of-points.
(2) On-flight Market Entries. The applicable on-flight market
entries shall be summarized to create totals by service class within
pair-of-points.
(e) Preparation of Schedule T-100 (f):
(1) Section A--Indicative and flight pattern information. A copy of
Schedule T-100(f) is shown at the end of this appendix. Section A
defines the origin and destination points and the service class code to
which the nonstop segment data in Section B and the on-flight market
data in Section C are applicable. Section A information, along with the
carrier code and report date, must be included on each schedule.
(2) Section B--Nonstop segment information. Section B of the
schedule is used for reporting nonstop segment information by aircraft
type. To reduce the number of schedules reported, space is provided for
including data on multiple different aircraft types. Similarly, the on-
flight market section has been included on a single Schedule T-100(f),
along with the nonstop segment data, rather than on a separate schedule.
(3) Section C--On-flight market information. Section C of the
schedule is used for reporting on-flight market data. There will always
be an on-flight market that corresponds to the nonstop segment. Because
the on-flight market data are reported at the service class level rather
than by aircraft type, a specific flight may produce more on-flight
markets than nonstop segments, (see examples in paragraph (c) of this
appendix), resulting in data reported in sections A and C only.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Data element definitions:
(1) Service pattern information.
(i) Line A-1 Carrier code. Use the carrier code established by the
Department. This code is provided to each carrier in the initial
reporting letter from the Office of Airline Information (OAI). If there
are any questions about these codes, contact the OAI Data Administration
Division at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(ii) Line A-2 Report date. This is the year and month to which the
data are applicable. For example, 200009 indicates the year 2000, and
the month of September.

[[Page 52]]

(iii) Line A-3 Origin airport code. This is the departure airport,
where an aircraft begins a flight segment, and where the passengers
originate in an on-flight market. Use the 3-letter code from the City/
Airport Codes section of the Official Airline Guide Worldwide Edition.
If no 3-letter code is available, OAI will assign one; the address is in
paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(iv) Line A-4 Destination airport code. This is the arrival airport,
where an aircraft stops on a flight segment, and where passengers
deplane (get off the flight) after reaching their destination in a
market. Use the 3-letter code from the source described in paragraph
(g)(1)(iii) of this appendix.
(v) Line A-5 Service class code. Select one of the following single
letter codes which describes the type of service being reported on a
given flight operation.

F = Scheduled Passenger/cargo Service
G = Scheduled All-cargo Service
L = Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo Charter
P = Nonscheduled Civilian All-Cargo Charter
Q = Nonscheduled Services (Other than Charter)

(2) Nonstop segment information:
(i) Line B-1 Aircraft type code. Use the four digit numeric code
prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this appendix. If no aircraft type
code is available, OAI will assign one. The address is in paragraph
(a)(3) of this appendix.
(ii) Line B-2 Aircraft departures performed. This is the total
number of physical departures performed with a given aircraft type,
within service class and pair-of-points.
(iii) Line B-3 Revenue passengers transported. This is the total
number of revenue passengers transported on a given nonstop segment. It
represents the total number of revenue passengers on board over the
segment without regard to their actual point of enplanement.
(iv) Line B-4 Revenue freight transported. This item is the total
weight in kilograms (kg) of the revenue freight transported on a given
nonstop segment without regard to its actual point of enplanement.
(3) On-flight market information:
(i) Line C-1 Total revenue passengers in market. This item
represents the total number of revenue passengers, within service class,
that were enplaned at the origin airport and deplaned at the destination
airport.
(ii) Line C-2 Total revenue freight in market. This item represents
the total weight in kilograms (kg) of revenue freight enplaned at the
origin and deplaned at the destination airport.
(h) [Reserved]
(i) Joint Service.
(1) The Department may authorize joint service operations between
two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint service operations are:
Blocked-space agreements;
Part-charter agreements;
Code-sharing agreements;
Wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.
(2) Joint-service operations shall be reported on BTS Form 41
Schedules T-100 and T-100(f) by the air carrier in operational control
of the flight, i.e., the air carrier that uses its flight crew to
perform the operation. If there are questions about reporting a joint-
service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director--Airline
Information at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(j) [Reserved]

leased with crew.
218.4 Condition upon authority of lessee.
218.5 Application for disclaimer of jurisdiction.

<r05>
Sec.  218.1  Definitions.

For the purpose of this part the term lease shall mean an agreement
under which an aircraft is furnished by one party to the agreement to
the other party, irrespective of whether the agreement constitutes a
true lease, charter arrangement, or some other arrangement.


<r05>
Sec.  218.2  Applicability.

This part applies to foreign air carriers and other persons not
citizens of the United States which, as lessors or lessees, enter into
agreements providing for the lease of aircraft with crew to a foreign
air carrier for use in foreign air transportation. For purposes of 49
U.S.C. 41301, the person who

[[Page 53]]

has operational control and safety responsibility is deemed to be the
carrier, and is required to have appropriate operating authority.

[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by ER-1250, 46 FR 47770,

<r05>
Sec.  218.3  Prohibition against unauthorized operations employing aircraft leased with crew.

(a) No foreign air carrier, or other person not a citizen of the
United States, shall lease an aircraft with crew to a foreign air
carrier for use by the latter in performing foreign air transportation
unless either:
(1) The lessor holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49
U.S.C. 41301 or an approved registration issued under part 294 of this
chapter, and any statement of authorization required by part 212 of this
chapter; or
(2) The Department has issued an exemption under 49 U.S.C. 40109
specifically authorizing the lessor to engage in the foreign air
transportation to be performed under the lease; or
(3) The Department has issued an order under Sec.  218.6 disclaiming
jurisdiction over the matter.
(b) For purposes of this part, an aircraft shall be considered to be
leased with crew if:
(1) The pilot in command or a majority of the crew of the aircraft,
other than cabin attendants:
(i) Is to be furnished by the lessor;
(ii) Is employed by the lessor;
(iii) Continues in the employ of the lessor in the operation of
services other than those provided for in the agreement between the
parties; or
(iv) Has been employed by the lessor prior to the lease, and the
employment of whom by the lessee is coextensive with the period or
periods for which the aircraft is available to the lessee under the
lease; or
(2) The aircraft is operated under operations specifications issued
to the lessor by the Federal Aviation Administration.

[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by ER-1250, 46 FR 47770,
Sept. 30, 1981; ER-1260, 46 FR 52598, Oct. 27, 1981; DOT-OST-2014-0140,
84 FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  218.4  Condition upon authority of lessee.

In any case where a foreign air carrier leases from another foreign
air carrier or other person not a citizen of the United States an
aircraft with crew for use in performing foreign air transportation, it
shall be a condition upon the authority of the lessee to perform such
foreign air transportation that compliance be achieved with the
requirements of this part.


<r05>
Sec.  218.5  Application for disclaimer of jurisdiction.

The parties to a lease with crew as described in Sec.  218.3(b) may
apply to the Department for an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the
matter. The application shall be filed jointly by both parties to the
lease, and shall generally conform to the procedural requirements of
part 302, subpart A, of this chapter. It shall be served upon any air
carrier providing services over all or any part of the route upon which
air transportation services will be provided pursuant to the agreement.
The application should set forth in detail all evidence and other
factors relied upon to demonstrate that true operational control and
safety responsibility for the air transportation services to be provided
are in the hands of the lessee rather than the lessor. A copy of the
agreement and all amendments thereof, as well as a summary
interpretation of its pertinent provisions, shall be included with the
applications. Any interested person may file an answer to the
application within 7 days after service hereof. Until the Department has
acted upon the application, no operations in foreign transportation
shall be performed pursuant to the agreement.

[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84
FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  218.6  Issuance of order disclaiming jurisdiction.

If the Department finds that true operational control and safety
responsibility will be vested in the lessee and not in the lessor (i.e.,
that the lease transaction is in substance a true lease

[[Page 54]]

of aircraft rather than a charter or series of charters), and that the
performance of the operations provided for in such lease will not result
in the lessor's being engaged in foreign air transportation, it will
issue an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. Otherwise the
application for disclaimer of jurisdiction will be denied.

[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84
FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]


<r05>
Sec.  218.7  Presumption.

Whether under a particular lease agreement the lessor of the
aircraft is engaged in foreign air transportation is a question of fact
to be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances.
However, in circumstances where the lessor furnishes both the aircraft
and the crew, there is a presumption that true operational control and
safety responsibility are exercised by the lessor, and that the
agreement constitutes a charter arrangement under which the lessor is
engaged in foreign air transportation. The burden shall rest upon the
applicants for disclaimer of jurisdiction in each instance to
demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the operation
contemplated will not constitute foreign air transportation by the
lessor.

each type of aircraft. Where fares are provided for different classes or
types of passenger service (that is, first class, coach, day coach,
night coach, tourist, economy or whatever other class or type of service
is provided under the tariff), the tariff shall specify the type of
aircraft and the seating configuration used on such aircraft for each
class or type of passenger service. When two or more classes or types of
passenger service are performed in a single aircraft, the seating
configuration for each type or class shall be stated and described.

provision of the Department's regulations issued under this part or
elsewhere shall be construed to require the filing of any tariff rules
stating any limitation on, or condition relating to, the carrier's

by the Department shall be construed to supersede or modify this rule of
construction except to the extent that such regulation shall do so in
express terms.
(6) Notice of limitation of liability for death or injury under the
Warsaw Convention. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of
this section, each air carrier and foreign air carrier shall publish in

limit of liability by a tariff provision. Unless the carrier elects to
assume unlimited liability, its tariffs shall contain a statement as to
the applicability and effect of the Warsaw Convention, including the
amount of the liability limit in dollars. Where applicable, a statement
advising passengers of the amount of any higher limit of liability
assumed by the carrier shall be added.

not file tariffs that set forth charges, rules, regulations, or
practices relating to the extension of credit for payment of charges
applicable to air transportation.

governing joint fares may be published for account of an individual
carrier participating in such joint fares provided that the tariff
clearly indicates how such individual carrier's provisions apply to the
through transportation over the applicable joint routes comprised of
such carrier and other carriers who either do not maintain such
provisions or who maintain different provisions on the same subject
matter.
(9) Passenger property which cannot lawfully be carried in the
aircraft cabin. Each air carrier shall set forth in its tariffs
governing the transportation of persons, including passengers' baggage,
charges, rules, and regulations providing that such air carrier
receiving as baggage any property of a person traveling in air
transportation, which property cannot lawfully be carried by such person
in the aircraft cabin by reason of any Federal law or regulation, shall
assume liability to such person, at a reasonable charge and subject to
reasonable terms and conditions, within the amount declared to the air
carrier by such person, for the full actual loss or damage to such
property caused by such air carrier.
(b) [Reserved]


<r05>

(b) Suspended matter not to be changed. A fare, charge, or other
tariff provision which is suspended by the Department shall not be
changed in any respect or withdrawn or the effective date thereof
further deferred except by authority of an order or special tariff
permission of the Department.
(c) Suspension continues former matter in effect. If a tariff
publication containing matter suspended by the Department directs the
cancellation of a tariff or any portion thereof, which contains fares,
charges, or other tariff provisions sought to be amended by the
suspended matter, such cancellation is automatically suspended for the
same period insofar as it purports to cancel any tariff provisions
sought to be amended by the suspended matter.
(d) Matter continued in effect not to be changed. A fare, charge, or
other tariff provision which is continued in effect as a result of a
suspension by the Department shall not be changed during the period of
suspension unless the change is authorized by order or special tariff
permission of the Department, except that such matter may be reissued
without change during the period of suspension.


<r05>
Sec.  221.81  Suspension supplement.

(a) Suspension supplement. Upon receipt of an order of the
Department suspending any tariff publication in part or in its entirety,
the carrier or agent who issued such tariff publication shall
immediately issue and file with the Department a consecutively numbered
supplement for the purpose of announcing such suspension.
(b) The suspension supplement shall not contain an effective date
and it shall contain the suspension notice required by paragraph (c) of
this section.
(c) Suspension notice. The suspension supplement shall contain a
prominent notice of suspension which shall:
(1) Indicate what particular fares, charges, or other tariff
provisions are under suspension,
(2) State the date to which such tariff matter is suspended,
(3) State the Department's docket number and order number which
suspended such tariff matter, and
(4) Give specific reference to the tariffs (specifying their D.O.T.
or other

[[Page 65]]

identifying numbers), original or revised records and paragraphs or
provisions which contain the fares, charges, or other tariff provisions
continued in effect.


<r05>
Sec.  221.82  Reissue of matter continued in effect by suspension
to be canceled upon termination of suspension.

When tariff provisions continued in effect by a suspension are
reissued during the period of such suspension, the termination of the
suspension and the coming into effect of the suspended matter will not
accomplish the cancellation of such reissued matter. In such
circumstances, prompt action shall be taken by the issuing agent or
carrier to cancel such reissued provisions upon the termination of the
suspension in order that they will not conflict with the provisions
formerly under suspension.


<r05>
Sec.  221.83  Tariff must be amended to make suspended matter
effective.

(a) When the Department vacates an order which suspended certain
tariff matter in full or in part, such matter will not become effective
until the termination of the suspension period unless the issuing agent
or carrier amends the pertinent tariffs in the manner prescribed in this
subpart (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).
(b) If the Department vacates its suspension order prior to the
original published effective date of the tariff provisions whose
suspension is vacated, such provisions will become effective on their
published effective date.


<r05>
Sec.  221.84  Cancellation of suspended matter subsequent to
date to which suspended.

(a) Endeavor to cancel prior to expiration of suspension period.
When an order of the Department requires the cancellation of tariff
provisions which were suspended by the Department and such cancellation
is required to be made effective on or before a date which is after the
date to which such tariff provisions were suspended, the issuing carrier
or agent shall, if possible, make the cancellation effective prior to
the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended.
(b) When necessary to republish matter continued in effect by
suspension. If suspended tariff provisions become effective upon
expiration of their suspension period and thereby accomplish the
cancellation of the tariff provisions continued in effect by the
suspension, the issuing agent or carrier shall republish and reestablish
such canceled tariff provisions effective simultaneously with the
cancellation of the suspended provisions in compliance with the
Department's order. The tariff amendments which reestablish such
canceled tariff provisions shall bear reference to this subpart and the
Department's order.


<r04>
Subpart J_Filing Tariff Publications With Department

it is delivered free from all charges, including claims for postage.


<r05>
Sec.  221.92  Number of copies required.

Two copies of each paper tariff, tariff revision and adoption notice
to be filed shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation,
Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20428. All such copies

under authority of its concurrence or power of attorney, such
concurrence or power of attorney shall, if not previously filed with the
Department, be transmitted at the same time such tariff is submitted for
filing.


<r05>
Sec.  221.94  Explanation and data supporting tariff changes
and new matter in tariffs.

When a tariff is filed with the Department which contains new or
changed local or joint fares or charges for foreign air transportation,
or new or changed classifications, rules, regulations, or practices
affecting such fares or charges, or the value of the service thereunder,
the issuing air carrier, foreign air carrier, or agent shall submit with
the filing of such tariff:
(a) An explanation of the new or changed matter and the reasons for
the filing, including (if applicable) the basis of rate making employed.
Where a tariff is filed pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved
by the Department, the explanation shall identify such agreement by DOT
Docket number, DOT order of approval number, IATA resolution number, or
if none is designated, then by other definite identification. Where a
tariff is filed on behalf of a foreign air carrier pursuant to a
Government order, a copy of such order shall be submitted with the
tariff.
(b) Appropriate Economic data and/or information in support of the
new or changed matter.
(c) Exceptions. (1) The requirement for data and/or information in
paragraph (b) of this section will not apply to tariff publications
containing new or changed matter which are filed:
(i) In response to Department orders or specific policy
pronouncements of the Department directly related to such new or changed
matter;
(ii) Pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the
Department setting forth the fares, charges (or specific formulas
therefor) or other matter: Provided that the changes are submitted with
the number of the DOT order of approval and fully comply with any
conditions set forth in that order;
(iii) To the extent fares for scheduled passenger service are within
a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility; and
(iv) To meet competition: Provided, that
(A) Changed matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet
competition only when it effects decreases in fares or charges and/or
increases the value of service so that the level of the fares or charges
and the services provided will be substantially similar to the level of
fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.
(B) New matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition
only when it establishes or affects a fare or charge and a service which
will be substantially similar to the fares or charges and the services
of a competing carrier or carriers.
(C) When new or changed matter is filed to meet competition over a
portion of the filing air carrier's system and is simultaneously made
applicable to the balance of the system, such matter, insofar as it
applies over the balance of the system, will be deemed to be within the
exception in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if such
carrier submits an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining
uniformity over its entire system with respect to such new or changed
matter.

[[Page 67]]

(D) In any case where new or changed matter is filed to meet
competition, the filing carrier or agent must supply, as part of the
filing justification, the complete tariff references which will serve to
identify the competing tariff matter which the tariff purports to meet.
In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new
or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it
purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter.
If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or
attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail,
the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is
substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.

Subpart K_Availability of Tariff Publications for Public Inspection


<r05>
Sec.  221.100  Public notice of tariff information.

Carriers must make tariff information available to the general
public, and in so doing must comply with either:

person, all tariffs applicable to passenger traffic from or to the point
where such station, office, or location is situated, including tariffs
covering any terminal services, charges, or practices whatsoever, which
apply to passenger traffic from or to such point.
(b) A carrier will be deemed to have complied with the requirement

and in the case of tariffs involving passenger fares, rules, charges or
practices, notice to the passenger as required in Sec.  221.105.

Department has authorized to be filed on shorter notice shall be posted
by the carrier on like notice as authorized for filing.


<r05>

Public Inspection of Tariffs

All the currently effective passenger tariffs to which this company
is a party and all passenger tariff publications which have been issued
but are not yet effective are on file in this office, so far as they
apply to traffic from or to. (Here name the point.) These tariffs may be

tariffs.
In addition, a complete file of all tariffs of this company, with
indexes thereof, is maintained and kept available for public inspection
at. (Here indicate the place or places where complete tariff files are

[[Page 68]]


<r05>
Sec.  221.105  Special notice of limited liability under
international treaty.

(a)(1) In addition to the other requirements of this subpart, each
air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself
of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by an
international treaty, shall, at the time of delivery of the ticket,
furnish to each passenger whose transportation is governed by the
international treaty and whose place of departure or place of
destination is in the United States, the following statement in writing:

Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability

Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate
destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure
are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw
Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a
carrier's own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be
applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely
within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty
governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death
or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and
for delay of passengers and baggage.
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing
insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any
limitation of the carrier's liability under an international treaty. For
further information please consult your airline or insurance company
representative.
(2) The statement prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section
shall be printed or displayed in type at least as large as 10-point
modern type and in a form that contrasts with the stock or background
on:
(i) Each ticket, including electronic tickets;
(ii) A piece of paper either placed in the ticket envelope with the
ticket or attached to the ticket; or
(iii) The ticket envelope.
(3) When a carrier is a signatory of a Department-approved
intercarrier agreement implementing an international treaty, and such
agreement contains specific text a carrier may use as a notice to
international passengers regarding carrier liability, the carrier may
substitute the exact text contained in the intercarrier agreement in
lieu of the required text of the notice quoted in paragraph (a)(1) of
this section.
(b) By December 31, 2019, each air carrier and foreign air carrier
which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to
passengers provided by an international treaty, shall also cause to be
displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk,
station, and position in the United States which is in the charge of a
person employed exclusively by it or by it jointly with another person,
or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to
sell tickets to passengers whose transportation may be governed by an
international treaty and whose place of departure or destination may be
in the United States, a sign which shall have printed thereon the
statement prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to ensure that
travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for such carrier
comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
section.
(d) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier subject to the provisions
of this section which wishes to use a notice of limited liability of its
own wording, but containing the substance of the language prescribed in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may substitute a notice of its
own wording upon approval by the Department.
(e) The requirements as to time and method of delivery of the notice
(including the size of type) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
section and the requirement with respect to travel agents specified in
paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Department upon
application and showing by the carrier that special and unusual
circumstances render the enforcement of the regulations impractical and
unduly burdensome and that adequate alternative means of giving notice
are employed.

[[Page 69]]

(f) Applications for relief under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this
section shall be filed with the Department's Office of International
Aviation not later than 15 days before the date on which such relief is
requested to become effective.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no air
taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter shall be required
to give the notices prescribed in this section, either in its capacity
as an air carrier or in its capacity as an agent for an air carrier or
foreign air carrier.

at all times, free of charge, information sufficient to enable the
passenger to request a copy of such term(s).
(b) Notice of incorporated terms. Each carrier and ticket agent

(a) Each carrier required to file tariffs in accordance with this
part shall make available to any person so requesting a subscription
service as described in paragraph (b) of this section for its passenger
tariffs issued by it or by a publishing agent on its behalf.

<r04>
Subpart L_Rejection of Tariff Publications


<r05>
Sec.  221.110  Department's authority to reject.

The Department may reject any tariff which is not consistent with
section 41504 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, with the regulations in this
part, or with Department orders.


<r05>
Sec.  221.111  Notification of rejection.

When a tariff is rejected, the issuing carrier or agent thereof will
be notified electronically or in writing that the tariff is rejected and
of the reason for such rejection.


<r05>
Sec.  221.112  Rejected tariff is void and must not be used.

A tariff rejected by the Department is void and is without any force
or effect whatsoever. Such rejected tariff must not be used.


<r04>
Subpart M_Special Tariff Permission To File on Less Than Statutory
Notice


<r05>
Sec.  221.120  Grounds for approving or denying Special
Tariff Permission applications.

(a) General authority. The Department may permit changes in fares,
charges or other tariff provisions on less than the statutory notice
required by section 41505 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII.
(b) Grounds for approval. The following facts and circumstances
constitute some of the grounds for approving applications for Special
Tariff Permission in the absence of other facts and circumstances
warranting denial:
(1) Clerical or typographical errors. Clerical or typographical
errors in tariffs constitute grounds for approving applications for
Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the
tariff changes necessary to correct such errors. Each application for
Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify
the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts
and circumstances, and such application shall be presented to the
Department with reasonable promptness after issuance of the defective
tariff.

[[Page 71]]

(2) Rejection caused by clerical or typographical errors or
unintelligibility. Rejection of a tariff caused by clerical or
typographical errors constitute grounds for approving applications for
Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice,
effective not earlier than the original effective dates in the rejected
tariff, all changes contained in the rejected tariff but with the errors
corrected. Each application for the grant of Special Tariff Permission
based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a
complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and
such application shall be filed with the Department within five days
after receipt of the Department's notice of rejection.
(3) Newly authorized transportation. The fact that the Department
has newly authorized a carrier to perform foreign air transportation
constitutes grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff
Permission to file on less than statutory notice the fares, rates, and
other tariff provisions covering such newly authorized transportation.
(4) The fact that a passenger fare is within a statutory or
Department-established zone of fare flexibility constitutes grounds for
approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff
stating that fare and any rules affecting them exclusively, on less than
statutory notice. The Department's policy on approving such applications
is set forth in Sec.  399.35 of this chapter.
(5) Lowered fares and charges. The prospective lowering of fares or
charges to the traveling public constitutes grounds for approving an
application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory
notice a tariff stating the lowered fares or charges and any rules
affecting them exclusively. However, the Department will not approve the
application if the proposed tariff raises significant questions of
lawfulness, as set forth in Sec.  399.35 of this chapter.
(c) Filing notice required by formal order. When a formal order of
the Department requires the filing of tariff matter on a stated number
of days' notice, an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on
less notice will not be approved. In any such instance a petition for
modification of the order should be filed in the formal docket.


<r05>
Sec.  221.121  How to prepare and file applications for
Special Tariff Permission.

(a) Form. Each application for Special Tariff Permission to file a
tariff on less than statutory notice shall conform to the requirements
of Sec.  221.212 if filed electronically.
(b) Number of paper copies and place of filing. For paper format
applications, the original and one copy of each such application for
Special Tariff Permission, including all exhibits thereto and amendments
thereof, shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation,
Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
(c) Who may make application. Applications for Special Tariff
Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than
statutory notice shall be made only by the issuing carrier or agent
authorized to issue and file the proposed tariff. Such application by
the issuing carrier or agent will constitute application on behalf of
all carriers participating in the proposed fares, or other tariff
provisions.
(d) When notice is required. Notice in the manner set forth in
paragraph (e) of this section is required when a carrier files an
application for Special Tariff Permission:
(1) To offer passenger fares that would be outside a Department-
established zone of price flexibility or, in markets for which the
Department has not established such a zone, outside the statutory zone
of price flexibility; or
(2) To file any price increase or rule change that the carrier
believes is likely to be controversial.
(e) Form of notice. When notice of filing of a Special Tariff
Permission application affecting passenger fares is required by
paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier shall, when it files the
application, give immediate telegraphic notice or other notice approved
by the Office of International Aviation, to all certificated and foreign
route carriers authorized to provide nonstop or one-stop service in the
markets involved, and to civic parties that would

[[Page 72]]

be substantially affected. The application shall include a list of the
parties notified.


<r05>
Sec.  221.122  Special Tariff Permission to be used in its entirety as granted.

Each Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff
provisions on less than statutory notice shall be used in its entirety
as granted. If it is not desired to use the permission as granted, and
lesser or more extensive or different permission is desired, a new
application for Special Tariff Permission conforming with Sec.  221.121
in all respects and referring to the previous permission shall be filed.


<r05>
Sec.  221.123  Re-use of Special Tariff Permission when tariff is rejected.

If a tariff containing matter issued under Special Tariff Permission
is rejected, the same Special Tariff Permission may be used in a tariff
issued in lieu of such rejected tariff provided that such re-use is not
precluded by the terms of the Special Tariff Permission, and is made
within the time limit thereof or within seven days after the date of the
Department's notice of rejection, whichever is later, but in no event
later than fifteen days after the expiration of the time limit specified
in the Special Tariff Permission.


<r04>
Subpart N_Waiver of Tariff Regulations


<r05>
Sec.  221.130  Applications for waiver of tariff regulations.

Applications for waiver or modification of any of the requirements
of this part 221 or for modification of chapter 415 of 49 U.S.C.
Subtitle VII with respect to the filing and posting of tariffs shall be
made by the issuing carrier or issuing agent.


<r05>
Sec.  221.131  Form of application for waivers.

Applications for waivers shall be in the form of a letter addressed
to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation
Washington, DC 20590, and shall:
(a) Specify (by section and paragraph) the particular regulation
which the applicant desires the Department to waive.
(b) Show in detail how the proposed provisions will be shown in the
tariff under authority of such waiver if granted (submitting exhibits of
the proposed provision where necessary to clearly show this
information).
(c) Set forth all facts and circumstances on which the applicant
relies as warranting the Department's granting the authority requested.
No tariff or other documents shall be filed pursuant to such application
prior to the Department's granting the authority requested.


<r04>
Subpart O_Giving and Revoking Concurrences to Carriers


<r05>
Sec.  221.140  Method of giving concurrence.

(a) A concurrence prepared in a manner acceptable to the Office of
International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to
another carrier to issue and file with the Department tariffs which
contain joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such
fares or charges, applying to, from, or via points served by the carrier
giving the concurrence. A concurrence shall not be used as authority to
file joint fares or charges in which the carrier to whom the concurrence
is given does not participate, and it shall not be used as authority to
file local fares or charges.
(b) Number of copies. Each concurrence shall be prepared in
triplicate. The original of each concurrence shall be filed with the
Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the carrier in whose
favor the concurrence is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by
the carrier who issued the concurrence.
(c) Conflicting authority to be avoided. Care should be taken to
avoid giving authority to two or more carriers which, if used, would
result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.


<r05>
Sec.  221.141  Method of revoking concurrence.

(a) A concurrence may be revoked by filing with the Department a
Notice of Revocation of Concurrence prepared in a form acceptable to the
Office of International Aviation.

[[Page 73]]

(b) Sixty days' notice required. Such Notice of Revocation of
Concurrence shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the
Department. A Notice of Revocation of Concurrence will be deemed to be
filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the period of
notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.
(c) Number of copies. Each Notice of Revocation of Concurrence shall
be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed with the
Department and, at the same time that the original is transmitted to the
Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to the carrier to whom
the concurrence was given. The third copy shall be retained by the
carrier issuing such notice.
(d) Amendment of tariffs when concurrence revoked. When a
concurrence is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or
tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing carrier of such tariffs,
on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than

revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of Revocation of Concurrence in a
form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation. Such revocation
notice shall include reference to the new concurrence.


<r04>
Subpart P_Giving and Revoking Powers of Attorney to Agents


<r05>
Sec.  221.150  Method of giving power of attorney.

(a) Prescribed form of power of attorney. A power of attorney
prepared in accordance with a form acceptable to the Office of
International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to
an agent and (in the case of the agent being an individual) such agent's
alternate to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain
local or joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such
fares or charges, applicable via and for account of such carrier. Agents
may be only natural persons or corporations (other than incorporated
associations of air carriers). The authority conferred in a power of
attorney may not be delegated to any other person.
(b) Designation of tariff issuing person by corporate agent. When a
corporation has been appointed as agent it shall forward to the
Department a certified excerpt of the minutes of the meeting of its
Board of Directors designating by name and title the person responsible
for issuing tariffs and filing them with the Department. Only one such
person may be designated by a corporate agent, and the title of such
designee shall not contain the word ``Agent''. When such a designee is
replaced the Department shall be immediately notified in like manner of
his successor. An officer or employee of an incorporated tariff-
publishing agent may not be authorized to act as tariff agent in his/her
individual capacity. Every tariff issued by a corporate agent shall be
issued in its name as agent.
(c) Number of copies. Each power of attorney shall be prepared in
triplicate. The original of each power of attorney shall be filed with
the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the agent in
whose favor the power of attorney is issued, and the third copy shall be
retained by the carrier who issued the power of attorney.
(d) Conflicting authority prohibited. In giving powers of attorney,
carriers shall not give authority to two or more agents which, if used,
would result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.


<r05>
Sec.  221.151  Method of revoking power of attorney.

(a) A power of attorney may be revoked only by filing with the
Department in the manner specified in this section a Notice of
Revocation of

[[Page 74]]

Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of International
Aviation.
(b) Sixty days' notice required. Such Notice of Revocation of Power
of Attorney shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the
Department. A Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney will be deemed
to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the
period of notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.
(c) Number of copies. Each Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney
shall be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed
with the Department and, at the same time that the original is
transmitted to the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to
the agent in whose favor the power of attorney was issued (except, if
the alternate agent has taken over the tariffs, the duplicate of the
Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be sent to the alternate
agent). The third copy of the notice shall be retained by the carrier.
(d) Amendment of tariffs when power of attorney is revoked. When a
power of attorney is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or
tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing agent of such tariffs, on
not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the
effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney.
In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the
provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.


<r05>
Sec.  221.152  Method of withdrawing portion of authority
conferred by power of attorney.

If a carrier desires to issue a power of attorney conferring less
authority than a previous power of attorney issued in favor of the same
agent, the new power of attorney shall not direct the cancellation of
such previous power of attorney. In such circumstances, such previous
power of attorney shall be revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of
Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of
International Aviation. Such revocation notice shall include reference
to the new power of attorney.


<r04>
Subpart Q_Adoption Publications Required To Show Change in Carrier's
Name or Transfer of Operating Control


<r05>
Sec.  221.160  Adoption notice.

(a) When the name of a carrier is changed or when its operating
control is transferred to another carrier (including another company
which has not previously been a carrier), the carrier which will
thereafter operate the properties shall immediately issue, file with the
Department, and post for public inspection, an adoption notice in a form
and containing such information as is approved by the Office of
International Aviation. (The carrier under its former name or the
carrier from whom the operating control is transferred shall be referred
to in this subpart as the ``former carrier'', and the carrier under its
new name or the carrier, company, or fiduciary to whom the operating
control is transferred shall be referred to in this subpart as the
``adopting carrier''.)
(b) The adoption notice shall be prepared, filed, and posted as a
tariff. The adoption notice shall be issued and filed by the adopting
carrier and not by an agent.
(c) Copies to be sent to agents and other carriers. At the same time
that the adoption notice is transmitted to the Department for filing,
the adopting carrier shall send copies of such adoption notice to each
agent and carrier to whom the former carrier has given a power of
attorney or concurrence. (See Sec.  221.163.)


<r05>
Sec.  221.161  Notice of adoption to be filed in former
carrier's tariffs.

At the same time that the adoption notice is issued, posted, and
filed pursuant to Sec.  221.160, the adopting carrier shall issue, post
and file with the Department a notice in each effective tariff issued by
the former carrier providing specific notice of the adoption in a manner
authorized by the Office of International Aviation and which shall
contain no matter other than that authorized.

[[Page 75]]


<r05>
Sec.  221.162  Receiver shall file adoption notices.

A receiver shall, immediately upon assuming control of a carrier,
issue and file with the Department an adoption notices as prescribed by
Sec. Sec.  221.160 and 221.161 and shall comply with the requirements of
this subpart.


<r05>
Sec.  221.163  Agents' and other carriers' tariffs shall
reflect adoption.

If the former carrier is shown as a participating carrier under
concurrence in tariffs issued by other carriers or is shown as a
participating carrier under power of attorney in tariffs issued by
agents, the issuing carriers and agents of such tariffs shall, upon
receipt of the adoption notice, promptly file on statutory notice the
following amendments to their respective tariffs:
(a) Cancel the name of the former carrier from the list of
participating carriers.
(b) Add the adopting carrier (in alphabetical order) to the list of
participating carriers. If the adopting carrier already participates in
such tariff, reference to the substitution notice shall be added in
connection with such carrier's name in the list of participating
carriers.


<r05>
Sec.  221.164  Concurrences or powers of attorney to be reissued.

(a) Adopting carrier shall reissue adopted concurrences and powers
of attorney. Within a period of 120 days after the date on which the
change in name or transfer of operating control occurs, the adopting
carrier shall reissue all effective powers of attorney and concurrences
of the former carrier by issuing and filing new powers of attorney and
concurrences, in the adopting carrier's name, which shall direct the
cancellation of the respective powers of attorney and concurrences of
the former carrier. The adopting carrier shall consecutively number its
powers of attorney and concurrences in its own series of power of
attorney numbers and concurrence numbers (commencing with No. 1 in each
series if it had not previously filed any such instruments with the
Department), except that a receiver or other fiduciary shall
consecutively number its powers of attorney or concurrences in the
series of the former carrier. The cancellation reference shall show that
the canceled power of attorney or concurrence was issued by the former
carrier.
(b) If such new powers of attorney or concurrences confer less
authority than the powers of attorney or concurrences which they are to
supersede, the new issues shall not direct the cancellation of the
former issues; in such instances, the provisions of Sec. Sec.  221.142
and 221.152 shall be observed. Concurrences and powers of attorney which
will not be replaced by new issues shall be revoked in the form and
manner and upon the notice required by Sec. Sec.  221.141 and 221.151.
(c) Reissue of other carriers' concurrences issued in favor of
former carrier. Each carrier which has given a concurrence to a carrier
whose tariffs are subsequently adopted shall reissue the concurrence in
favor of the adopting carrier. If the carrier which issued the
concurrence to the former carrier desires to revoke it or desires to
replace it with a concurrence conferring less authority, the provisions
of Sec. Sec.  221.141 and 221.142 shall be observed.


<r05>
Sec.  221.165  Cessation of operations without successor.

If a carrier ceases operations without having a successor, it shall:
(a) File a notice in each tariff of its own issue and cancel such
tariff in its entirety.
(b) Revoke all powers of attorney and concurrences which it has
issued.

carrier's published schedules for the same city pair during the previous
month.

published arrival time.
On-time performance means the percentage of scheduled operations of
a specific flight that an air carrier operates on-time during a month.
On-time performance code means a single character determined in
accordance with the provisions of this part that reflects the monthly
on-time performance of certain nonstop flights and single plane one-stop

taking place before January 1, 2018 means any nonstop flight, including
a mechanically delayed flight, to or from any airport within the

<r05>
Sec.  234.4  Reporting of on-time performance.

(a) Each reporting carrier shall file BTS Form 234 ``On-Time Flight
Performance Report'' with the Office of Airline Information of the
Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics on a monthly basis,
setting forth the information for each of its reportable flights
operated by the reporting carrier and held out to the public on the
reporting carrier's Web site and the Web sites of major online travel
agencies, or in other generally recognized sources of schedule
information. (See also paragraph (k) of this section.) The reportable
flights include, but are not limited to, cancelled flights, mechanically
cancelled flights, diverted flights, new flights and wet-leased flights.

the date of the scheduled operation of the flight, as shown in the most
recent Official Airline Guide, and in computer reservations systems.
Each carrier shall designate a single computer reservations system in
addition to the Official Airline Guide as the sources of scheduled
arrival time and departure time data in its reports to the Department
and shall report the scheduled arrival times and departure times listed
in those sources for each flight. Scheduled elapsed times, amount of
departure and/or arrival delay, and elapsed time difference shall be
calculated using the scheduled times shown in the designated CRS source.
(h) Reporting carriers should use the following codes to identify
causes for cancelled flights:

Code
A--Air Carrier
B--Extreme Weather
C--National Aviation System (NAS).
D-Security

(1) Air Carrier cancellations are due to circumstances that were
within the control of the air carrier (e.g., lack of flight crew,
maintenance, etc.).
(2) Extreme weather cancellations are caused by weather conditions
(e.g., significant meteorological conditions), actual or forecasted at
the point of departure, en route, or point of arrival that, in
accordance with applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment
of the air carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents
operations of subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out
of position as a result of a prior cancellation or delay attributable to
weather.
(3) NAS cancellations are caused by circumstances within the
National Aviation System. This term is used to refer to a broad set of
conditions: weather-non-extreme, airport operations, heavy traffic
volume, air traffic control, etc.
(4) Security cancellations may be the result of malfunctioning
screening or other security equipment or a breech of security that
causes the evacuation of the airport or individual concourses, or the
need to re-screen passengers.
(i) Reporting carriers should use the following causes to identify
the reasons for delayed flights:

CAUSE
Air Carrier
Extreme weather
NAS
Security
Late arriving aircraft

(1) Air carrier delays are due to circumstances within the control
of the air carrier.
(2) Extreme weather delays are caused by weather conditions (e.g.,
significant meteorological conditions, actual or forecasted at the point
of departure, en route, or point of arrival that, in accordance with
applicable regulatory standards and/or in the judgment of the air
carrier, prevents operation of that flight and/or prevents operations of
subsequent flights due to the intended aircraft being out of position as
a result of a prior cancellation or delay attributable to weather.
(3) NAS delays are caused by circumstances within the National
Aviation System. This term is used to refer to a broad set of
conditions: weather-non-extreme, airport operations, heavy traffic
volume, air traffic control, etc.
(4) Security delays may be the result of malfunctioning screening or
other security equipment or a breech of security that causes the
evacuation of the airport or individual concourses or the need to re-
screen passengers.
(5) Late arriving aircraft delays are the result of a late incoming
aircraft from the previous flight.
(j) When reporting causal codes in paragraph (a) of this section,
reporting carriers are required to code delays only when the arrival
delay is 15 minutes or greater; and reporting carriers must report each
causal component of

[[Page 91]]

the reportable delay when the causal component is 5 minutes or greater.
(k) For air transportation taking place on or after January 1, 2018,
each reporting carrier shall also file a separate BTS Form 234 ``On-Time
Flight Performance Report'' with the Office of Airline Information on a
monthly basis, setting forth the information for each of its reportable
flights held out with only the reporting carrier's airline designator
code on the reporting carrier's Web site, on the Web sites of major
online travel agencies, or in other generally recognized sources of
schedule information, and operated by any code-share partner that is a
certificated air carrier or commuter air carrier. If the operating
carrier of the flight is not a reporting carrier, the non-operating
reporting carrier must file a BTS Form 234 ``On-time Flight Performance
Report'' with the Office of Airline Information on a monthly basis,
setting forth the information regarding those flights in a form and
manner consistent with the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)
through (j) of this section. If the operating carrier of the flight is a
reporting carrier, the non-operating reporting carrier must file a
simplified BTS Form 234 ``On-Time Flight Performance Report'' with the
Office of Airline Information on a monthly basis, setting forth the
information regarding those flights in a form and manner consistent with
the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(4) and
paragraph (a)(10) of this section, and in accordance with the
requirements set forth in accounting and reporting directives issued by
the Office of Airline Information.

(a) Each reporting carrier shall calculate an on-time performance
code in accordance with this section and as provided in more detail in
accounting and reporting directives issued by the Director, Office of
Airline Information. The calculations shall be performed for each
reportable flight, except those scheduled to operate three times or less
during a month. In addition, each reporting carrier shall assign an on-
time performance code to each of its single plane one-stop or multi-stop

[[Page 93]]

flights, or portion thereof, that the carrier holds out to the public
through a CRS, the last segment of which is a reportable flight.
(b) The on-time performance code shall be calculated as follows:
(1) Based on reportable flight data provided to the Department,
calculate the percentage of on-time arrivals of each nonstop flight.
Calculations shall not include discontinued or extra-section flights for
which data are not reported to the Department.
(2) Based upon the on-time performance percentage calculated in
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, assign a single digit code to each

in a CRS, the performance code for the nonstop flight segment arriving
at the destination listed in the CRS shall be used.
(4) In the case of a new flight, carriers shall assign a performance
code consisting of the letter ``N.'' A flight that is not a new flight
shall be assigned the performance code calculated for the flight that it
replaces, even if the two flights do not have the same flight number. In
the case of a flight scheduled to operate three times or less during a
month, carriers shall assign a performance code consisting of the letter
``U.''
(c) Carriers shall calculate on-time performance percentages and
assign on-time performance codes on a monthly basis. This process shall
be completed no later than the 15th day of each month, when the reports
required by this part are due to the Department, and the codes shall
reflect the previous month's operations.

<r05>
Section 04  Air Carrier Groupings

(a) All large certificated air carriers are placed into three basic
air carrier groupings based upon their level of operations and the
nature of these operations. In order to determine the level of
operations, total operating revenues for a twelve-month period are used.
The following operating revenue ranges are used to establish air carrier
groupings:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Carrier Group               Total Annual Operating Revenues
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I..............................  0-$100,000,000
II.............................  $100,000,001-$1,000,000,000
III............................  $1,000,000,001 +
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For reporting purposes, Group I air carriers are further divided
into two subgroups: (1) Air carriers with total annual operating
revenues from $20,000,000 to $100,000,000 and (2) Air carriers with
total annual operating revenues below $20,000,000.
(b) Both the criteria for establishing air carrier groupings and the
assignment of each air carrier to a specific group of carriers will be
reviewed periodically by the Director, Office of Airline Information, to
assure the maintenance of appropriate standards for the grouping of
carriers. When an air carrier's level of operations passes the upper or
lower limit of its currently assigned carrier grouping, the carrier is
not automatically transferred to a different group and a new level of
reporting. The Office of Airline Information will issue an updated
listing of the carrier groups on an annual basis. A carrier may petition
for reconsideration of its assigned carrier grouping or request a waiver
from the accounting and reporting requirements that are applicable to a
particular group under the provisions of section 1-2 of this Uniform
System of Accounts and Reports.

General Accounting Provisions


<r05>
Section 1  Introduction to System of Accounts and Reports


<r05>
Sec. 1-1  Applicability of system of accounts and reports.

Each large certificated air carrier shall keep its books of account,
records and memoranda and make reports to the BTS in accordance with
this system of accounts and reports. The BTS reserves the right,
however, under the provisions of sections 49 U.S.C. 41701 and 41708, to
expand or otherwise modify the classes of carriers subject to this
system of accounts and reports.

[ER-1400, 50 FR 11, Jan. 2, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26,
1995]


<r05>
Sec. 1-2  Waivers from this system of accounts and reports.

A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts or reports
may be made by the BTS upon its own initiative or upon the submission of
written request therefor from any air carrier, or group of air carriers,
provided that such a waiver is in the public interest and each request
for waiver expressly demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or
unusual circumstances warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or
technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique
will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of
operating results or financial condition, consistent with the principles
embodied in the provisions of this system of accounts and reports; and
the application of such alternative procedure will maintain or improve
uniformity in substantive results as between air carriers.

[[Page 106]]


<r05>
Sec. 1-3  General description of system of accounts and reports.

(a) This system of accounts and reports is designed to permit
limited contraction or expansion to reflect the varying needs and
capacities of different air carriers without impairing basic accounting
comparability as between air carriers. In its administration three air
carrier groups, designated Group I, Group II, and Group III,
respectively (see section 04), are established by the BTS. This grouping
will be reviewed from time to time upon petition of individual air
carriers or by initiative of the BTS with the view of a possible
regrouping of the air carriers.
(b) Under the system of accounts prescribed, balance sheet elements
are accounted for by all air carrier groups within a fixed uniform
pattern of specific accounts. All profit and loss elements are accounted
for within specific objective accounts established for each air carrier
group resulting from dual classifications, designated for each air
carrier group, which are descriptive of both basic areas of financial
activity, or functional operation, and objective served. The profit and
loss elements of the three air carrier groups can be reduced to broad
objectives and general or functional classifications which are
comparable for all air carrier groups. Both balance sheet and profit and
loss accounts and account groupings are designed, in general, to embrace
all activities, both air transport and other than air transport, in
which the air carrier engages and provide for the separation of elements
identifiable exclusively with other than air transport activities.
Profit and loss elements which are recorded during the current
accounting year are subclassified as between (1) those which relate to
the current accounting year and adjustments of a recurrent nature
applicable to prior accounting years, and (2) extraordinary items of
material magnitude.
(c) In order to afford air carriers as much flexibility and freedom
as possible in establishing ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet their
individual needs, a minimum number of account subdivisions have been
prescribed in this Uniform System of Accounts. It is intended, however,
that each air carrier, in maintaining its accounting records, will
provide subaccount and subsidiary account segregations of accounting
elements which differ in nature of accounting characteristics, in a
manner which will render individual elements readily discernible and
traceable throughout the accounting system, and will provide for
relating profit and loss elements to applicable balance sheet
counterparts.

[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec.
26, 1995]


<r05>
Sec. 1-4  System of accounts coding.

(a) A four digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet
and profit and loss account. Each balance sheet account is numbered
sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet
classifications. The first two digits of the four digit code assigned to
each profit and loss account denote a detailed area of financial
activity or functional operation. The first two digits, thus assigned to
each profit and loss account, are numbered sequentially within blocks,
designating more general classifications of financial activity and
functional operation. The second two digits assigned to profit and loss
accounts denote objective classifications.
(b) A fifth digit, appended as a decimal, has been assigned for
internal control by the BTS of prescribed subdivisions of the primary
objective balance sheet and profit and loss classifications. A different
fifth digit code number from that assigned by the BTS may be adopted for
internal recordkeeping by the air carrier provided the prescribed
subclassification of objective accounts is not impaired and the code
number assigned by the BTS is employed in reporting to the BTS on Form
41 Reports.

[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec.

<r05>
Sec. 1-5  Records.

(a) The general books of account and all books, records, and
memoranda which support in any way the entries therein shall be kept in
such manner as to provide at any time full information relating to any
account. The entries in each account shall be supported by

[[Page 107]]

such detailed information as will render certain the identification of
all facts essential to a verification of the nature and character of
each entry and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform
System of Accounts. Registers, or other appropriate records, shall be
maintained of the history and nature of each note receivable and each
note payable.
(b) The books and records referred to herein include not only
accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records
such as organization tables and charts, internal accounting manuals and
revisions thereto, minute books, stock books, reports, cost
distributions and other accounting work sheets, correspondence,
memoranda, etc., which may constitute necessary links in developing the
history of, or facts regarding, any accounting or financial transaction.
(c) All books, records and memoranda shall be preserved and filed in
such manner as to readily permit the audit and examination thereof by
representatives of the DOT. All books, records, and memoranda shall be
housed or stored in such manner as to afford protection from loss,
theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise and no such books and
records shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except in
conformance with 14 CFR part 249 for the preservation of records.

<r05>
Sec. 1-6  Accounting entities.

(a) Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each air
transport entity for which separate reports to the BTS are required to
be made by sections 21(g) and for each separate corporate or
organizational division of the air carrier. For purposes of this Uniform
System of Accounts and Reports, each nontransport entity conducting an
activity which is not related to the air carrier's transport activities
and each transport-related activity or group of activities qualifying as
a nontransport venture pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section,
whether or not formally organized within a distinct organizational unit,
shall be treated as a separately operated organizational division;
except that provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (b) shall not
apply to leasing activities.
(b) As a general rule, any activity or group of activities
comprising a transport-related service provided for in transport-related
revenue and expense accounts 09 through 18 shall be considered a
separate nontransport venture under circumstances in which either: (1) A
separate corporate or legal entity has been established to perform such
services, (2) the aggregate annual revenue rate, as determined in
section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater
of $1 million per annum or one percent of the air carrier's total annual
transport revenues, or (3) the aggregate annual expense rate, as
determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years
exceeds the greater of $1 million or one percent of the carrier's total
annual operating expenses: Provided, That revenues and expenses from in-
flight sales, and interchange sales shall be considered related to air
transportation and accounted for accordingly, regardless of the revenue
or expense standard set forth above.
(c) The records for each required accounting entity shall be
maintained with sufficient particularity to permit a determination that
the requirements of section 2-1 have been complied with.

Sec. 1-7  Interpretation of accounts.

To the end that uniform accounting may be maintained, questions
involving matters of accounting significance which are not clearly
provided for should be submitted to the Director, Office of Airline
Information, K-25, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for explanation,
interpretation, or resolution.

Section 2  General Accounting Policies


<r05>
Sec. 2-1  Generally accepted accounting principles.

(a) The accounting provisions contained in this part are based on
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Persons subject to this
part are authorized to implement, as prescribed by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, newly issued GAAP pronouncements until and
unless the Director, Office of Airline Information (OAI), issues an
Accounting Directive making an initial determination that implementation
of a new pronouncement would adversely affect the Department's programs.
(b) The Director, OAI, shall review each newly issued GAAP
pronouncement to determine its affect on the Department's regulatory
programs. If adopting a specific change in GAAP would adversely affect
the Department's programs, the Director will issue the results of the
review in the form of an Accounting Directive. The directive will state
the reasons why the particular change should not be incorporated in the
uniform system of accounts and contain accounting guidance for
maintaining the integrity of the Department's air carrier accounting
provisions.
(c) Objections and comments relating to the Department's decision
not to implement a change in generally accepted principles may be
addressed to Director, Office of Airline Information, K-25, U.S.
Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington,
DC 20590. If significant objections are raised urging adoption of a
particular GAAP pronouncement, the Department will institute a
rulemaking.

<r05>
Sec. 2-2  Basis of allocation between entities.

(a) The provisions of this section shall apply to each person
controlling an air carrier, each person controlled by the air carrier,
as well as each transport entity and organizational division of the air
carrier for which separate records must be maintained pursuant to
section 1-6.
(b) Each transaction shall be recorded and placed initially under
accounting controls of the particular air transport entity or
organizational division of the air carrier or member of an affiliated
group to which directly traceable. If applicable to two or more
accounting entities, a proration shall be made from the entity of
original recording to other participating entities on such basis that
the statements of financial condition and operating results of each
entity are comparable to those of distinct legal entities. The
allocations involved shall include all debits and credits associated
with each entity.
(c) For purposes of this section, investments by the air carrier in
resources or facilities used in common by the regulated air carrier and
those transport-related revenue services defined as separate
nontransport ventures under section 1-6(b) shall not be allocated
between such entities but shall be reflected in total in the appropriate
accounts of the entity which predominately uses those investments. Where
the entity of predominate use is a nontransport venture, the air carrier
shall reflect the investment in account 1510.3, Advances to Associated
Companies.
(d) For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, all
revenues shall be assigned to or apportioned between accounting entities
on bases which will fully recognize the services provided by each
entity, and expenses, or costs, shall be apportioned between accounting
entities on such bases as will result: (1) With respect to

[[Page 109]]

transport-related services, in the assignment thereto of proportionate
direct overheads, as well as direct labor and materials, of the
applicable expense functions prescribed by this system of accounts and
reports, and (2) with respect to separate ventures, in the assignment
thereto of proportional general and administrative overheads as well as
the direct overheads, labor, and materials.

(a) Revenues and expenses attributable to a single natural objective
account or functional classification shall be assigned accordingly.
(b) Revenue and expense items which are common to two or more
natural objective accounts shall be recorded in the objective accounts
to which they predominantly relate.
(c) Expense items contributing to more than one function shall be
charged to the general overhead functions to which applicable except
that where only incidental contribution is made to more than a single
function an item may be included in the function to which primarily
related, provided such function is not distorted by including an
aggregation of amounts applicable to other functions. When assignment of
expense items on the basis of the primary activity to which related does
not in the aggregate result in a fair presentation of the expenses
applicable to each function, apportionment shall be made between
functions based upon a study of the contribution to each function during
a representative period.

nearly as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be fully reflected in the
air carrier's books for the quarter in which revenues have been earned
and the costs attaching to the revenues so earned in each quarter have
been incurred independently of the incidence of sales or purchases and
settlement with debtors or creditors.
(c) Expenditures incurred during the current accounting year which
demonstrably benefit operations to be performed during subsequent
accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized
to the period in which the related operations are performed when of
sufficient magnitude to distort the accounting results of the year in
which incurred.
(d) Expenditures charged directly or amortized to operations within
one accounting year shall not be reversed in a subsequent accounting
year and reamortized or charged directly against operations of
subsequent years except that retroactive adjustments are permitted where
necessary to conform with adjustments required by the DOT for ratemaking
purposes.

1300 Spare parts and supplies.
(a) Record here the cost of:

[[Page 113]]

(1) Flight equipment replacement parts of a type which ordinarily
would be recurrently expended and replaced rather than repaired and
reused;
(2) Unissued fuel inventories for use in the overall or system
operations of the carrier. Adjustments of inventories for aircraft fuel
due to retroactive price increases and decreases shall not be entered in
this account but in profit and loss account 45, Aircraft Fuels and Oils;
and
(3) Unissued and unapplied materials and supplies held in stock such
as unissued shop materials, expendable tools, stationery and office
supplies, passenger service supplies, and restaurant and food service
supplies.
(b) Costs paid by the air carrier such as transportation charges and
customs duties; excise, sales, use and other taxes; special insurance;
and other charges applicable to the cost of spare parts and supplies
shall be charged to this account when they can be definitely allocated
to specific items or units of property. If such costs cannot be so
allocated, or if of minor significance in relation to the cost of such
property, such amounts may be charged to balance sheet account 1890
Other Assets and Deferred Charges and cleared either by a suitable
``loading charge'' as the parts are used or by current charges to
appropriate expense or property accounts; so long as the method of
application does not cause material distortion in operating expenses
from one accounting period to another.
(c) Reusable spare parts and supplies recovered in connection with
construction, maintenance, or retirement of property and equipment shall
be included in this account at fair and reasonable values but in no case
shall such values exceed original cost. Recoveries of normally reparable
and reusable parts of a type for which losses in value may be covered on
a practical basis through valuation allowance provisions shall be
included in this account on an original cost basis. Scrap and nonusable
parts, expensed from this account and recovered, shall be included at
net amounts realizable therefrom with contra credit to the expense
accounts initially charged.
(d) The cost of rotable parts and assemblies of material value
included in this account which ordinarily are repaired and reused and
possess a service life approximating that of the primary property types
to which related shall not be recorded in this account but in balance
sheet account 1608 Flight Equipment Rotable Parts and Assemblies. For
purposes of identifying rotable parts and assemblies of insignificant
unit value which may be included in this account, a reasonable maximum
unit value limitation may be established.
(e) Any losses sustained or gains realized upon the abandonment or
other disposition of flight equipment expendable parts shall be taken up
as capital gains or losses in the periods in which sustained or
realized. (See balance sheet account 1311.)
(f) Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense
accounts as issued for use. Profit and loss on sales of inventory items
as a routine service to others shall be included in profit and loss

accounts at full cost.
(g) Materials and supplies held in small supply and purchased
currently may be charged to appropriate expense accounts when purchased.
(h) An allowance for inventory adjustment applicable to materials
and supplies is prohibited. Items in this account shall be charged to
appropriate expense accounts as issued for use.
(i) Subaccounts shall be established within this account for the
separate recording of each class or type of spare parts and supplies.

(a) Accruals shall be made to this account when allowances are
established for losses in the value of expendable parts. The accruals to
this account shall be made by charges to profit and loss account 73
Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration--Expendable Parts. Records
shall be maintained with sufficient detail to permit association of the
allowances with each class or type of expendable parts.

[[Page 114]]

(b) The accruals to this account shall be based upon a
predetermination by the air carrier of that portion of the total
inventory of each class and type of expendable parts against which an
allowance for loss is to be accrued. Expendable parts issued for use in
operations shall be charged to operating expenses as issued and shall
not be charged to this account. If at the end of any calendar year the
amount of the allowance exceeds the product of the applicable inventory
for the year determined consistently on a year-end or average basis, and
the sum of the standard percentage accrual rates for all prior years
including the current, the allowance shall be adjusted downward by the
amount of the excess. Such adjustments shall be charged to this account
and credited to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence
and Deterioration--Expendable Parts.
(c) Where changing conditions necessitate a revision or adjustment
in rates of accrual, such revision or adjustment shall be made
applicable to current and subsequent accounting periods and shall not be
applied retroactively to prior accounting periods. Following retirement
of airframe or aircraft engine types to which related, any balance
remaining in this account shall be offset against related balances
carried in balance sheet account 1300 Spare Parts and Supplies and the
net cleared to profit and loss accounts 88.5 Capital Gains and Losses--
Operating Property or 88.6 Capital Gains and Losses--Other.

Section 8  General

(a) The profit and loss accounts are designed to reflect, through
natural groupings, the elements entering into the derivation of income
or loss accruing to the proprietary interests during each accounting
period.
(b) The prescribed system of accounts provides for the co-ordinate
grouping of all revenues and expenses in terms of both major natural
objectives and functional activities and for subdivision of both to
provide varying degrees of detail for air carriers of differing
accounting capacities and/or requirements.
(c) The detailed objective accounts established for each air carrier
group, by the dual subdivision of profit and loss elements in terms of
both natural objectives and functional activities, are set forth in
section 7, Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts.
(d) The prescribed system of accounts provides generally that profit
and loss elements shall be grouped in accordance with their inherent
characteristics within the following primary classifications:
(1) Operating revenues. (i) This primary classification shall
include revenues of a character usually and ordinarily derived from the
performance of air transportation and air transportation-related
services, which relate to services performed during the current

a pro rata basis unless the services are so infrequent in performance or
small in volume as to result in no appreciable demands upon the air
carrier's maintenance facilities. When overhauls of airframes or
aircraft engines are as a consistent practice accounted for on an
accrual basis instead of being expensed directly, maintenance burden
shall be allocated to such overhauls on a pro rata basis. Standard
burden rates may be employed for quarterly allocations of maintenance
burden provided the rates are reviewed at the close of each calendar
year. When the actual burden rate for the year differs materially from
the standard burden rate applied, adjustment shall be made to reflect
the actual cost incurred for the full accounting year. Allocations of
maintenance burden to capital projects, and service sales to others
shall be made through the individual maintenance burden objective
accounts, except that the air carrier may make such allocations by
credits to profit and loss account 77 Uncleared Expense Credits provided
that use of that account will not undermine the significance of the
individual maintenance burden objective accounts in terms of the expense
levels associated with the air carrier's air transport services.

Section 12  Objective Classification--Operating Revenues and Expenses

00 General Instructions.
(a) Basic objective accounts, applicable to all air carrier groups,
are established for recording all revenue and expense elements. These
basic accounts

[[Page 135]]

are in certain areas subdivided to provide greater detail for indicated
air carrier groups.
(b) Each air carrier shall credit the gross revenues accruing from
services ordinarily associated with air transportation and
transportation-related services to the appropriate account established
for each revenue source. Expenses incident to transport and transport-
related services shall be charged to the accounts established in this
section in accordance with the objectives served by each expenditure.
However, direct costs of forwarding traffic as a result of interrupted
trips, and refunds of sales, shall be charged to the applicable revenue
account.
(c) To the end that the integrity of the prescribed objective
accounts shall not be impaired, each air carrier shall:
(1) Charge the appropriate account prescribed for each service
purchased or expense element incurred expressly for the benefit of the
air carrier regardless of whether incurred directly by the air carrier
or through an agent or other intermediary, and (2) except as provided in
objective account 77, Uncleared Expense Credits, credit or charge, as
appropriate, the account prescribed for each expense element which may
be involved in distributions of expenses between (i) separate operating
entities of the air carrier, (ii) transport-related services and
transport services, or transport functions, (iii) balance sheet and
profit and loss elements, and (iv) the air carrier and others, when the
expenses are incurred initially by or for the benefit of the air
carrier. At the option of the air carrier, standard rates applicable to
each objective account comprising a particular pool of expenses subject
to assignment between two or more activities, may be established for
proration purposes, provided the rates established are predicated upon
the experience of the air carrier and are reviewed and modified as
appropriate at least once each year.

Transport Revenues

01 Passenger.
(a) Record here revenue from the transportation of passengers by
air, including infants transported at reduced fares, berth charges,
surcharges for premium services and other similar charges. Revenue from
airline employees, officers and directors, or other persons, except for
ministers of religion, who are traveling under reduced-rate
transportation authorized by 49 U.S.C. 41511(a) and 14 CFR part 223, as
well as revenue from travel agents, cargo agents and tour conductors
traveling at reduced fares, and revenues from service charges for
passengers traveling on a nonrevenue basis shall be recorded in
objective account 19 Air Transport--Other.
(b) This account shall be subdivided as follows by all air carrier
groups:

01.1 Passenger--First Class.

Record here revenue from the air transportation of passengers moving
at either standard fares or premium fares, or at reduced fares not
predicated upon the use of aircraft space specifically separated from
first class, and for whom standard or premium quality services are
provided.

01.2 Passenger--Coach.

Record here revenue from the air transportation of passengers moving
at special fares reduced from the first class or premium fares which are
predicated upon both the operation of specifically designated aircraft
space and a reduction in the quality of service regularly and ordinarily
