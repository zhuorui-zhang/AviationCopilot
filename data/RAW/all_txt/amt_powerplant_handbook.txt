# Aviation Maintenance Technician  Handbook–Powerplant  

2023 The Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–Powerplant (FAA-H-8083-32B) is one of a series of three handbooks for  persons preparing for certification as a powerplant mechanic. It is intended that this handbook provide the basic information  on principles, fundamentals, and technical procedures in the subject matter areas relating to the powerplant rating. It is  designed to aid students enrolled in a formal course of instruction, as well as the individual who is studying on his or her  own. Since the knowledge requirements for the airframe and powerplant ratings closely parallel each other in some subject  areas, the chapters which discuss fire protection systems and electrical systems contain some material which is also duplicated  in the Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–Airframe (FAA-H-8083-31B).  

This handbook contains an explanation of the units that make up each of the systems that bring fuel, air, and ignition together  in an aircraft engine for combustion. It also contains information on engine construction features, lubrication systems, exhaust  systems, cooling systems, cylinder removal and replacement, compression checks, and valve adjustments. Because there  are so many different types of aircraft in use today, it is reasonable to expect that differences exist in airframe components  and systems. To avoid undue repetition, the practice of using representative systems and units is carried out throughout  the handbook. Subject matter treatment is from a generalized point of view and should be supplemented by reference to  manufacturer's manuals or other textbooks if more detail is desired. This handbook is not intended to replace, substitute  for, or supersede official regulations or the manufacturer’s instructions. Occasionally the word “must” or similar language  is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not intended to add to, interpret, or relieve  a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

The subject of Human Factors is contained in the Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—General (FAA-H-8083-30)  (as revised).  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from  www.faa.gov .  

This handbook is published by the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Airman  Testing Standards Branch, AFS-630, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125.

# Chapter 1 Aircraft Engines  

# General Requirements  

Aircraft require thrust to produce enough speed for the wings  to provide lift or enough thrust to overcome the weight of  the aircraft for vertical takeoff. For an aircraft to remain in  level flight, thrust must be provided that is equal to and in  the opposite direction of the aircraft drag. This thrust, or  propulsive force, is provided by a suitable type of aircraft  heat engine. All heat engines have in common the ability to  convert heat energy into mechanical energy by the flow of  some fluid mass (generally air) through the engine. In all  cases, the heat energy is released at a point in the cycle where  the working pressure is high relative to atmospheric pressure.  

The propulsive force is obtained by the displacement of  a working fluid (again, atmospheric air). This air is not  necessarily the same air used within the engine. By displacing  air in a direction opposite to that in which the aircraft is  propelled, thrust can be developed. This is an application of  Newton’s third law of motion. It states that for every action  there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, as air is being  displaced to the rear of the aircraft the aircraft is moved forward  by this principle. One misinterpretation of this principle is air  is pushing against the air behind the aircraft making it move  forward. This is not true. Rockets in space have no air to push  against, yet, they can produce thrust by using Newton’s third  law. Atmospheric air is the principal fluid used for propulsion  in every type of aircraft powerplant except the rocket, in which  the total combustion gases are accelerated and displaced. The  rocket must provide all the fuel and oxygen for combustion  and does not depend on atmospheric air. A rocket carries its  own oxidizer rather than using ambient air for combustion. It  discharges the gaseous byproducts of combustion through the  exhaust nozzle at an extremely high velocity (action) and it is  propelled in the other direction (reaction).  

The propellers of aircraft powered by reciprocating or  turboprop engines accelerate a large mass of air at a relatively  lower velocity by turning a propeller. The same amount of  thrust can be generated by accelerating a small mass of air  to a very high velocity. The working fluid (air) used for the  propulsive force is a different quantity of air than that used  within the engine to produce the mechanical energy to turn  the propeller.  

Turbojets, ramjets, and pulse jets are examples of engines that  accelerate a smaller quantity of air through a large velocity  change. They use the same working fluid for propulsive force  that is used within the engine. One problem with these types  of engines is the noise made by the high velocity air exiting  the engine. The term turbojet was used to describe any gas  turbine engine, but with the differences in gas turbines used in  aircraft, this term is used to describe a type of gas turbine that  passes all the gases through the core of the engine directly.  

Turbojets, ramjets, and pulse jets have very little to no use  in modern aircraft due to noise and fuel consumption. Small  general aviation aircraft use mostly horizontally opposed  reciprocating piston engines. While some aircraft still use  radial reciprocating piston engines, their use is very limited.  Many aircraft use a form of the gas turbine engine to produce  power for thrust. These engines are normally the turboprop,  turboshaft, turbofan, and a few turbojet engines. “Turbojet”  is the former term for any turbine engine. Now that there are  so many different types of turbine engines, the term used to  describe most turbine engines is “gas turbine engine.” All  four of the previously mentioned engines belong to the gas  turbine family.  

All aircraft engines must meet certain general requirements of  efficiency, economy, and reliability. Besides being economical  in fuel consumption, an aircraft engine must be economical in  the cost of original procurement and the cost of maintenance;  and it must meet exacting requirements of efficiency and low  weight-to-horsepower ratio. It must be capable of sustained  high-power output with no sacrifice in reliability; it must also  have the durability to operate for long periods of time between  overhauls. It needs to be as compact as possible yet have easy  accessibility for maintenance. It is required to be as vibration  free as possible and be able to cover a wide range of power  output at various speeds and altitudes.  

These requirements dictate the use of ignition systems  that deliver the firing impulse to the spark plugs at the  proper time in all kinds of weather and under other adverse  conditions. Engine fuel delivery systems provide metered fuel  at the correct proportion of air-fuel ingested by the engine  regardless of the attitude, altitude, or type of weather in which  the engine is operated. The engine needs a type of oil system  that delivers oil under the proper pressure to lubricate and  cool all of the operating parts of the engine when it is running.  Also, it must have a system of damping units to damp out the  vibrations of the engine when it is operating.  

# Power & Weight  

The useful output of all aircraft powerplants is thrust, the  force which propels the aircraft. Since the reciprocating  engine is rated in brake horsepower (bhp), the gas turbine  engine is rated in thrust horsepower (thp):  

The value of 375 mile-pounds per hour is derived from the  basic horsepower formula as follows:  

![](images/d3fcfb02206caf86a70deb86ca37175bf1238e96e869db5cac9663fab508e043.jpg)  

One horsepower equals 33,000 ft-lb per minute or 375 mile- pounds per hour. Under static conditions, thrust is figured as  equivalent to approximately 2.6 pounds per hour.  

If a gas turbine is producing 4,000 pounds of thrust and the  aircraft in which the engine is installed is traveling at 500  mph, the thp is:  

$$
\widehat{\left[\begin{array}{l}{4,\!000\times500}\\ {\qquad375}\end{array}\right]}=5,\!333.33\;\mathrm{thp}\;
$$  

It is necessary to calculate the horsepower for each speed of an  aircraft, since the horsepower varies with speed. Therefore, it  is not practical to try to rate or compare the output of a turbine  engine on a horsepower basis. The aircraft engine operates  at a relatively high percentage of its maximum power output  throughout its service life. The aircraft engine is at full power  output whenever a takeoff is made. It may hold this power for  a period of time up to the limits set by the manufacturer. The  engine is seldom held at a maximum power for more than  2 minutes, and usually not that long. Within a few seconds  after lift-off, the power is reduced to a power that is used for  climbing and that can be maintained for longer periods of  time. After the aircraft has climbed to cruising altitude, the  power of the engine(s) is further reduced to a cruise power  which can be maintained for the duration of the flight.  

If the weight of an engine per brake horsepower (called  the specific weight of the engine) is decreased, the useful  load that an aircraft can carry and the performance of the  aircraft obviously are increased. Every excess pound of  weight carried by an aircraft engine reduces its performance.  Tremendous improvement in reducing the weight of the  aircraft engine through improved design and metallurgy  has resulted in reciprocating engines with a much improved  power-to-weight ratio (specific weight).  

# Fuel Economy  

The basic parameter for describing the fuel economy of  aircraft engines is usually specific fuel consumption. Specific  fuel consumption for gas turbines is the fuel flow measured  in   $(1\mathbf{b}/\mathbf{hr})$   divided by thrust (lb), and for reciprocating engines  the fuel flow   $(1\mathrm{b/hr})$   divided by brake horsepower. These are  called thrust-specific fuel consumption and brake-specific  fuel consumption, respectively. Equivalent specific fuel  consumption is used for the turboprop engine and is the fuel  flow in pounds per hour divided by a turboprop’s equivalent  shaft horsepower. Comparisons can be made between the  various engines on a specific fuel consumption basis. At low  speed, the reciprocating and turboprop engines have better  economy than the pure turbojet or turbofan engines. However,  at high speed, because of losses in propeller efficiency, the  reciprocating or turboprop engine’s efficiency becomes  limited above  $400\,\mathrm{mph}$   less than that of the turbofan.  

# Durability & Reliability  

Durability and reliability are usually considered identical  factors since it is difficult to mention one without including  the other. Simply put, reliability is measured as the mean time  between failures, while durability is measured as the mean  time between overhauls.  

More specifically, an aircraft engine is reliable when it can  perform at the specified ratings in widely varying flight  attitudes and in extreme weather conditions. Standards  of powerplant reliability are agreed upon by the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), the engine manufacturer,  and the airframe manufacturer. The engine manufacturer  ensures the reliability of the product by design, research,  and testing. Close control of manufacturing and assembly  procedures is maintained, and each engine is tested before  it leaves the factory.  

Durability is the amount of engine life obtained while  maintaining the desired reliability. The fact that an engine  has successfully completed its type or proof test indicates  that it can be operated in a normal manner over a long period  before requiring overhaul. However, no definite time interval  between overhauls is specified or implied in the engine  rating. The time between overhauls (TBO) varies with the  operating conditions, such as engine temperatures, amount  of time the engine is operated at high-power settings, and the  maintenance received. Recommended TBOs are specified by  the engine manufacturer.  

Reliability and durability are built into the engine by the  manufacturer, but the continued reliability of the engine is  determined by the maintenance, overhaul, and operating  personnel. Careful maintenance and overhaul methods,  thorough periodical and preflight inspections, and strict  observance of the operating limits established by the engine  manufacturer make engine failure a rare occurrence.  

# Operating Flexibility  

Operating flexibility is the ability of an engine to run  smoothly and give desired performance at all speeds from  idling to full-power output. The aircraft engine must also  function efficiently through all the variations in atmospheric  conditions encountered in widespread operations.  

# Compactness  

To affect proper streamlining and balancing of an aircraft, the  shape and size of the engine must be as compact as possible.  In single-engine aircraft, the shape and size of the engine also  affect the view of the pilot, making a smaller engine better  from this standpoint, in addition to reducing the drag created  by a large frontal area.  

Weight limitations, naturally, are closely related to the  compactness requirement. The more elongated and spread  out an engine is, the more difficult it becomes to keep the  specific weight within the allowable limits.  

# Powerplant Selection  

Engine specific weight and specific fuel consumption were  discussed in the previous paragraphs, but for certain design  requirements, the final powerplant selection may be based  on factors other than those that can be discussed from an  analytical point of view. For that reason, a general discussion  of powerplant selection follows.  

For aircraft whose cruising speed does not exceed  $250\,\mathrm{mph}$  ,  the reciprocating engine is the usual choice of powerplant.  When economy is required in the low speed range, the  conventional reciprocating engine is chosen because of  its excellent efficiency and relatively low cost. When high  altitude performance is required, the turbo-supercharged  reciprocating engine may be chosen because it is capable  of maintaining rated power to a high altitude (above 30,000  feet). Gas turbine engines operate most economically at  high altitudes. Although in most cases the gas turbine engine  provides superior performance, the cost of gas turbine  engines is a limiting factor. In the range of cruising speed of  180 to  $350~\mathrm{mph}$  , the turboprop engine performs very well.  It develops more power per pound of weight than does  the reciprocating engine, thus allowing a greater fuel load  or payload for engines of a given power. From   $350~\mathrm{mph}$  up to Mach .8–.9, turbofan engines are generally used for  airline operations. Aircraft intended to operate at Mach 1 or  higher are powered by pure turbojet engines/afterburning  (augmented) engines, or low-bypass turbofan engines.  

# Types of Engines  

Aircraft engines can be classified by several methods. They  can be classed by operating cycles, cylinder arrangement,  or the method of thrust production. All are heat engines that  convert fuel into heat energy that is converted to mechanical  energy to produce thrust. Most of the current aircraft engines  are of the internal combustion type because the combustion  process takes place inside the engine. Aircraft engines  come in many different types, such as gas turbine based,  reciprocating piston, rotary, two or four cycle, spark ignition,  diesel, and air or water cooled. Reciprocating and gas turbine  engines also have subdivisions based on the type of cylinder  arrangement (piston) and speed range (gas turbine).  

Many types of reciprocating engines have been designed.  However, manufacturers have developed some designs that  are used more commonly than others and are, therefore,  recognized as conventional. Reciprocating engines may be  classified according to the cylinder arrangement (inline,  V-type, radial, and opposed) or according to the method of  cooling (liquid cooled or air cooled). Actually, all piston  engines are cooled by transferring excess heat to the  surrounding air. In air-cooled engines, this heat transfer is  direct from the cylinders to the air. Therefore, it is necessary to  provide thin metal fins on the cylinders of an air-cooled engine  in order to have increased surface for sufficient heat transfer.  Most reciprocating aircraft engines are air cooled although  a few high powered engines use an efficient liquid-cooling  system. In liquid-cooled engines, the heat is transferred  from the cylinders to the coolant, which is then sent through  tubing and cooled within a radiator placed in the airstream.  The coolant radiator must be large enough to cool the liquid  efficiently. The main problem with liquid cooling is the added  weight of coolant, heat exchanger (radiator), and tubing to  connect the components. Liquid cooled engines do allow high  power to be obtained from the engine safely.  

# Inline Engines  

An inline engine generally has an even number of cylinders,  although some three-cylinder engines have been constructed.  This engine may be either liquid cooled or air cooled and has  only one crank shaft, which is located either above or below  the cylinders. If the engine is designed to operate with the  The inline engine has a small frontal area and is better  adapted to streamlining. When mounted with the cylinders  in an inverted position, it offers the added advantages of a  shorter landing gear and greater pilot visibility. With increase  in engine size, the air cooled, inline type offers additional  problems to provide proper cooling; therefore, this type of  engine is confined to low- and medium-horsepower engines  used in very old light aircraft.  

# Opposed or O-Type Engines  

The opposed-type engine has two banks of cylinders  directly opposite each other with a crankshaft in the center.  [Figure 1-1]  The pistons of both cylinder banks are connected  to the single crankshaft. Although the engine can be either  liquid cooled or air cooled, the air-cooled version is used  predominantly in aviation. It is generally mounted with  the cylinders in a horizontal position. The opposed-type  engine has a low weight-to-horsepower ratio, and its narrow  silhouette makes it ideal for horizontal installation on the  aircraft wings (twin engine applications). Another advantage  is its low vibration characteristics.  

# V-Type Engines  

In V-type engines, the cylinders are arranged in two inline  banks generally set   $60^{\circ}$   apart. Most of the engines have 12  cylinders, which are either liquid cooled or air cooled. The  engines are designated by a V followed by a dash and the  piston displacement in cubic inches. For example, V-1710.  This type of engine was used mostly during the Second World  War and its use is mostly limited to older aircraft.  

# Radial Engines  

The radial engine consists of a row, or rows, of cylinders  arranged radially about a central crankcase.  [Figure 1-2]  This  type of engine has proven to be very rugged and dependable.  The number of cylinders which make up a row may be three,  

![](images/56e8552f257bc489538d058011661aeb3cb200380868c1e2e9a90f0b8f5cf92a.jpg)

five, seven, or nine. Some radial engines have two rows of  seven or nine cylinders arranged radially about the crankcase,  one in front of the other. These are called double-row radials.  [Figure 1-3]  One type of radial engine has four rows of  cylinders with seven cylinders in each row for a total of 28  cylinders. Radial engines are still used in some older cargo  airplanes, war birds, and crop spray airplanes. Although  many of these engines still exist, their use is limited. The  single-row, nine-cylinder radial engine is of relatively simple  construction, having a one-piece nose and a two-section  main crankcase. The larger twin-row engines are of slightly  more complex construction than the single row engines.  For example, the crankcase of the Wright R-3350 engine  is composed of the crankcase front section, four crankcase  main sections (front main, front center, rear center, and

rear main), rear cam and tappet housing, supercharger front  housing, supercharger rear housing, and supercharger rear  housing cover. Pratt and Whitney engines of comparable size  incorporate the same basic sections, although the construction  and the nomenclature differ considerably.  

# Reciprocating Engines  

# Design & Construction  

The basic major components of a reciprocating engine are  the crankcase, cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, valves,  valve-operating mechanism, and crankshaft. In the head  of each cylinder are the valves and spark plugs. One of the  valves is in a passage leading from the induction system; the  other is in a passage leading to the exhaust system. Inside  each cylinder is a movable piston connected to a crankshaft  by a connecting rod.  Figure 1-4  illustrates the basic parts of  a reciprocating engine.  

# Crankcase Section  

The foundation of an engine is the crankcase. It contains  the bearings and bearing supports in which the crankshaft  revolves. Besides supporting itself, the crankcase must  provide a tight enclosure for the lubricating oil and must  support various external and internal mechanisms of the  engine. It also provides support for attachment of the  cylinder assemblies, and the powerplant to the aircraft. It  must be sufficiently rigid and strong to prevent misalignment  of the crankshaft and its bearings. Cast or forged aluminum  alloy is generally used for crankcase construction because  it is light and strong. The crankcase is subjected to many  variations of mechanical loads and other forces. Since the  cylinders are fastened to the crankcase, the tremendous  forces placed on the cylinder tend to pull the cylinder  off the crankcase. The unbalanced centrifugal and inertia  forces of the crankshaft acting through the main bearings  subject the crankcase to bending moments which change  continuously in direction and magnitude. The crankcase  must have sufficient stiffness to withstand these bending  moments without major deflections.  [Figure 1-5]  

If the engine is equipped with a propeller reduction gear, the  front or drive end is subjected to additional forces. In addition  to the thrust forces developed by the propeller under high  power output, there are severe centrifugal and gyroscopic  forces applied to the crankcase due to sudden changes in the  direction of flight, such as those occurring during maneuvers  of the airplane. Gyroscopic forces are particularly severe  when a heavy propeller is installed. To absorb centrifugal  loads, a large centrifugal bearing is used in the nose section.  

![](images/f32aede84cacc28c753fd08e6a56a502b3bc456c98f3fe1434e1b588c6c07c72.jpg)

Figure 1-5.   The crankcase.  

The shape of the nose or front of the crankcase section  varies considerably. In general, it is either tapered or round.  Depending upon the type of reciprocating engine, the nose or  front area of the crankcase varies somewhat. If the propeller  is driven directly by the crankshaft, less area is needed for  this component of the engine. The crankcases used on engines  having opposed or inline cylinder arrangements vary in form  for the different types of engines, but in general they are  approximately cylindrical. One or more sides are surfaced to  serve as a base to which the cylinders are attached by means  of cap screws, bolts, or studs. These accurately machined  surfaces are frequently referred to as cylinder pads.  

If the propeller is driven by reduction gearing (gears that slow  down the speed of the propeller less than the engine), more  area is required to house the reduction gears. A tapered nose  section is used quite frequently on direct-drive, low-powered  engines, because extra space is not required to house the  propeller reduction gears. Crankcase nose sections are usually  cast of either aluminum alloy or magnesium. The crankcase  nose section on engines that develop from 1,000 to 2,500  hp is usually larger to house reduction gears and sometimes  ribbed to get as much strength as possible.  

The governor is used to control propeller speed and blade  angle. The mounting of the propeller governor varies. On  some engines, it is located on the rear section, although this  complicates the installation, especially if the propeller is  operated or controlled by oil pressure, because of the distance  between the governor and propeller. Where hydraulically  operated propellers are used, it is good practice to mount  the governor on the nose section as close to the propeller  as possible to reduce the length of the oil passages. The  governor is then driven either from gear teeth on the periphery  of the bell gear or by some other suitable means. This basic  On some of the larger radial engines, a small chamber is located  on the bottom of the nose section to collect the oil. This is called  the nose section oil sump. Since the nose section transmits  many varied forces to the main crankcase or power section,  it must be secured properly to transmit the loads efficiently.  

The machined surfaces on which the cylinders are mounted are  called cylinder pads. They are provided with a suitable means  of retaining or fastening the cylinders to the crankcase. The  general practice in securing the cylinder flange to the pad is  to mount studs in threaded holes in the crankcase. The inner  portion of the cylinder pads are sometimes chamfered or  tapered to permit the installation of a large rubber O-ring around  the cylinder skirt, which effectively seals the joint between the  cylinder and the crankcase pads against oil leakage.  

Because oil is thrown about the crankcase, especially on  inverted inline and radial-type engines, the cylinder skirts  extend a considerable distance into the crankcase sections to  reduce the flow of oil into the inverted cylinders. The piston  and ring assemblies must be arranged so that they throw out  the oil splashed directly into them.  

Mounting lugs are spaced about the periphery of the rear  of the crankcase or the diffuser section of a radial engine.  These are used to attach the engine assembly to the engine  mount or framework provided for attaching the powerplant  to the fuselage of single-engine aircraft or to the wing nacelle  structure of multiengine aircraft. The mounting lugs may  be either integral with the crankcase or diffuser section or  detachable, as in the case of flexible or dynamic engine mounts.  

The mounting arrangement supports the entire powerplant  including the propeller, and therefore is designed to provide  ample strength for rapid maneuvers or other loadings. Because  of the elongation and contraction of the cylinders, the intake  pipes which carry the mixture from the diffuser chamber  through the intake valve ports are arranged to provide a slip  joint which must be leak proof. The atmospheric pressure on  the outside of the case of an un-supercharged engine is higher  than on the inside, especially when the engine is operating at  idling speed. If the engine is equipped with a supercharger  and operated at full throttle, the pressure is considerably  higher on the inside than on the outside of the case. If the  slip joint connection has a slight leakage, the engine may  idle fast due to a slight leaning of the mixture. If the leak is  quite large, it may not idle at all. At open throttle, a small  leak probably would not be noticeable in operation of the  engine, but the slight leaning of the air-fuel mixture might  cause detonation or damage to the valves and valve seats. On  some radial engines, the intake pipe has considerable length  and on some inline engines, the intake pipe is at right angles  to the cylinders. In these cases, flexibility of the intake pipe  or its arrangement eliminates the need for a slip joint. In any  case, the engine induction system must be arranged so that it  does not leak air and change the desired air-fuel ratio.  

# Accessory Section  

The accessory (rear) section usually is of cast construction  and the material may be either aluminum alloy, which is used  most widely, or magnesium, which has been used to some  extent. On some engines, it is cast in one piece and provided  with means for mounting the accessories, such as magnetos,  carburetors, fuel, oil, vacuum pumps, starter, generator,  tachometer drive, etc., in the various locations required  to facilitate accessibility. Other adaptations consist of an  aluminum alloy casting and a separate cast magnesium cover  plate on which the accessory mounts are arranged. Accessory  drive shafts are mounted in suitable drive arrangements  that are carried out to the accessory mounting pads. In this  manner, the various gear ratios can be arranged to give the  proper drive speed to magnetos, pumps, and other accessories  to obtain correct timing or functioning.  

# Accessory Gear Trains  

Gear trains, containing both spur- and bevel-type gears, are  used in the different types of engines for driving engine  components and accessories. Spur-type gears are generally  used to drive the heavier loaded accessories or those requiring  the least play or backlash in the gear train. Bevel gears permit  angular location of short stub shafts leading to the various  accessory mounting pads. On opposed, reciprocating engines,  the accessory gear trains are usually simple arrangements.  Many of these engines use simple gear trains to drive the  engine’s accessories at the proper speeds.  

# Crankshafts  

The crankshaft is carried in a position parallel to the  longitudinal axis of the crankcase and is generally supported  by a main bearing between each throw. The crankshaft main  bearings must be supported rigidly in the crankcase. This  usually is accomplished by means of transverse webs in the  crankcase, one for each main bearing. The webs form an  integral part of the structure and, in addition to supporting  the main bearings, add to the strength of the entire case.  

![](images/60d8a9380527c7659b053b66fee71e286cd70128174be03a213a3554661a3860.jpg)  
Figure 1-6.   Typical opposed engine exploded into component assemblies.  

The crankcase is divided into two sections in a longitudinal  plane. This division may be in the plane of the crankshaft so  that one-half of the main bearing (and sometimes camshaft  bearings) are carried in one section of the case and the other  half in the opposite section.  [Figure 1-6]  Another method is  to divide the case in such a manner that the main bearings  are secured to only one section of the case on which the  cylinders are attached, thereby providing means of removing  a section of the crankcase for inspection without disturbing  the bearing adjustment.  

The crankshaft is the backbone of the reciprocating engine. It  is subjected to most of the forces developed by the engine. Its  main purpose is to transform the reciprocating motion of the  piston and connecting rod into rotary motion for rotation of  the propeller. The crankshaft, as the name implies, is a shaft  composed of one or more cranks located at specified points  along its length. The cranks, or throws, are formed by forging  offsets into a shaft before it is machined. Since crankshafts  must be very strong, they generally are forged from a very  strong alloy, such as chromium-nickel-molybdenum steel.  

A crankshaft may be of single-piece or multipiece  construction.  Figure 1-7  shows two representative types of  solid crankshafts used in aircraft engines. The four-throw  construction may be used either on four-cylinder horizontal  opposed or four-cylinder inline engines. The six-throw shaft  is used on six-cylinder inline engines, 12-cylinder V-type  engines, and six-cylinder opposed engines. Crankshafts  of radial engines may be the single-throw, two-throw, or  four-throw type, depending on whether the engine is the  single-row, twin-row, or four-row type. A single-throw radial  engine crankshaft is shown in  Figure 1-8 . No matter how  many throws it may have, each crankshaft has three main  parts—a journal, crankpin, and crank cheek. Flyweights and  dampers, although not a true part of a crankshaft, are usually  attached to it to reduce engine vibration.  

The journal is supported by, and rotates in, a main bearing. It  serves as the center of rotation of the crankshaft. It is surface- hardened to reduce wear. The crankpin is the section to which  the connecting rod is attached. It is off-center from the main  journals and is often called the throw. Two crank cheeks  and a crankpin make a throw. When a force is applied to the  crankpin in any direction other than parallel or perpendicular  to and through the center line of the crankshaft, it causes the  crankshaft to rotate. The outer surface is hardened by nitriding  to increase its resistance to wear and to provide the required  bearing surface. The crankpin is usually hollow. This reduces  the total weight of the crankshaft and provides a passage for  the transfer of lubricating oil. On early engines, the hollow  crankpin also served as a chamber for collecting sludge,  carbon deposits, and other foreign material. Centrifugal force  threw these substances to the outside of the chamber and  kept them from reaching the connecting-rod bearing surface.  Due to the use of ashless dispersant oils, newer engines no  longer use sludge chambers. On some engines, a passage  is drilled in the crank cheek to allow oil from the hollow  crankshaft to be sprayed on the cylinder walls. The crank  cheek connects the crankpin to the main journal. In some  designs, the cheek extends beyond the journal and carries a  flyweight to balance the crankshaft. The crank cheek must be  of sturdy construction to obtain the required rigidity between  the crankpin and the journal.  

In all cases, the type of crankshaft and the number of crankpins  must correspond with the cylinder arrangement of the engine.  The position of the cranks on the crankshaft in relation to the  other cranks of the same shaft is expressed in degrees.  

The simplest crankshaft is the single-throw or   $360^{\circ}$   type.  This type is used in a single-row radial engine. It can be  constructed in one or two pieces. Two main bearings (one  on each end) are provided when this type of crankshaft is  used. The double-throw or  $180^{\circ}$   crankshaft is used on double- row radial engines. In the radial-type engine, one throw is  provided for each row of cylinders.  

# Crankshaft Balance  

Excessive vibration in an engine not only results in fatigue  failure of the metal structures, but also causes the moving  parts to wear rapidly. In some instances, excessive vibration  is caused by a crankshaft that is not balanced. Crankshafts are  balanced for static balance and dynamic balance. A crankshaft  is statically balanced when the weight of the entire assembly  of crankpins, crank cheeks, and flyweights is balanced around  the axis of rotation. When checked for static balance, it is  placed on two knife edges. If the shaft tends to turn toward  any one position during the test, it is out of static balance.  Any engine to be overhauled completely should receive a  runout check of its crankshaft as a first step. Any question  concerning crankshaft replacement is resolved at this time  since a shaft whose runout is beyond limits must be replaced.  

# Dynamic Dampers  

A crankshaft is dynamically balanced when all the forces  created by crankshaft rotation and power impulses are  balanced within themselves so that little or no vibration is  produced when the engine is operating. To reduce vibration  to a minimum during engine operation, dynamic dampers are  incorporated on the crankshaft. A dynamic damper is merely  a pendulum that is fastened to the crankshaft so that it is free  to move in a small arc. It is incorporated in the flyweight  assembly. Some crankshafts incorporate two or more of these  assemblies, each being attached to a different crank cheek.  The distance the pendulum moves and, thus, its vibrating

Figure 1-7.   Solid types of crankshafts.  

frequency corresponds to the frequency of the power impulses  of the engine. When the vibration frequency of the crankshaft  occurs, the pendulum oscillates out of time with the crankshaft  vibration, thus reducing vibration to a minimum.  

The construction of the dynamic damper used in one engine  consists of a movable slotted-steel flyweight attached to the

crank cheek. Two spool-shaped steel pins extend into the  slot and pass through oversized holes in the flyweight and  crank cheek. The difference in the diameter between the pins  and the holes provides a pendulum effect. An analogy of the  functioning of a dynamic damper is shown in  Figure 1-9 .  

# Connecting Rods  

The connecting rod is the link that transmits forces between  the piston and the crankshaft.  [Figure 1-10]  Connecting rods  must be strong enough to remain rigid under load and yet be  light enough to reduce the inertia forces that are produced  when the rod and piston stop, change direction, and start  again at the end of each stroke.  

There are four types of connecting-rod assemblies  [Figure 1-11]  

1.	 Plain. 2. 	 Fork and blade. 3. 	 Master and articulated. 4.	 Split-type.  

# Master-and-Articulated Rod Assembly  

The master-and-articulated rod assembly is commonly used  in radial engines. In a radial engine, the piston in one cylinder  in each row is connected to the crankshaft by a master rod.  All other pistons in the row are connected to the master  rod by articulated rods. In an 18-cylinder engine, which  has two rows of cylinders, there are two master rods and  16 articulated rods. The articulated rods are constructed of  forged steel alloy in either the I- or H-shape, denoting the  cross-sectional shape. Bronze bushings are pressed into the  

![](images/428b5510f25549d77469f14998620d397e8721e7e1b5c52a5900aa9e7f10cfdc.jpg)  
Figure 1-9.   Principles of a dynamic damper.  

bores in each end of the articulated rod to provide knuckle- pin and piston-pin bearings.  

The master rod serves as the connecting link between the  piston pin and the crankpin. The crankpin end, or the big end,  contains the crankpin or master rod bearing. Flanges around  the big end provide for the attachment of the articulated rods.  The articulated rods are attached to the master rod by knuckle  pins, which are pressed into holes in the master rod flanges  during assembly. A plain bearing, usually called a piston-pin  bushing, is installed in the piston end of the master rod to  receive the piston pin.  

When a crankshaft of the split-spline or split-clamp type is  employed, a one-piece master rod is used. The master and  articulated rods are assembled and then installed on the  crankpin; the crankshaft sections are then joined together.  In engines that use the one-piece type of crankshaft, the big  end of the master rod is split, as is the master rod bearing.  The main part of the master rod is installed on the crankpin;  then the bearing cap is set in place and bolted to the master  rod. The centers of the knuckle pins do not coincide with  the center of the crankpin. Thus, while the crankpin center  describes a true circle for each revolution of the crankshaft,  the centers of the knuckle pins describe an elliptical path.  [Figure 1-12]  The elliptical paths are symmetrical about a  center line through the master rod cylinder. It can be seen that  the major diameters of the ellipses are not the same. Thus,  the link rods have varying degrees of angularity relative to  the center of the crank throw.  

Because of the varying angularity of the link rods and the  elliptical motion of the knuckle pins, all pistons do not move  an equal amount in each cylinder for a given number of degrees  of crank throw movement. This variation in piston position  between cylinders can have considerable effect on engine  operation. To minimize the effect of these factors on valve and  ignition timing, the knuckle pin holes in the master rod flange  are not equidistant from the center of the crankpin, thereby  offsetting to an extent the effect of the link rod angularity.  

Another method of minimizing the adverse effects on engine  operation is to use a compensated magneto. In this magneto  the breaker cam has a number of lobes equal to the number  of cylinders on the engine. To compensate for the variation  in piston position due to link rod angularity, the breaker cam  lobes are ground with uneven spacing. This allows the breaker  contacts to open when the piston is in the correct firing position.  This is further outlined during the discussion on ignition timing  in Chapter 4, Engine Ignition & Electrical Systems.  

# Knuckle Pins  

The knuckle pins are of solid construction except for the  oil passages drilled in the pins, which lubricate the knuckle  pin bushings. These pins may be installed by pressing into  holes in the master rod flanges so that they are prevented  from turning in the master rod. Knuckle pins may also be  installed with a loose fit so that they can turn in the master rod  flange holes, and also turn in the articulating rod bushings.  These are called full-floating knuckle pins. In either type of  installation, a lock plate on each side retains the knuckle pin  and prevents a lateral movement.

Figure 1-12.   Elliptical travel path of knuckle pins in an articulated  rod assembly.  

Plain-type connecting rods are used in inline and opposed  engines. The end of the rod attached to the crankpin is fitted  with a cap and a two-piece bearing. The bearing cap is held  on the end of the rod by bolts or studs. To maintain proper  fit and balance, connecting rods should always be replaced  in the same cylinder and in the same relative position.  

# Fork-and-Blade Rod Assembly  

The fork-and-blade rod assembly is used primarily in V-type  engines. The forked rod is split at the crankpin end to allow  space for the blade rod to fit between the prongs. A single two- piece bearing is used on the crankshaft end of the rod. This  type of connecting rod is not used much on modern engines.  

# Pistons  

The piston of a reciprocating engine is a cylindrical member  which moves back and forth within a steel cylinder.  [Figure 1-13]  The piston acts as a moving wall within the  combustion chamber. As the piston moves down in the  cylinder, it draws in the air-fuel mixture. As it moves upward,  it compresses the charge, ignition occurs, and the expanding  gases force the piston downward. This force is transmitted  to the crankshaft through the connecting rod. On the return  upward stroke, the piston forces the exhaust gases from the  cylinder and the cycle repeats.

Figure 1-13.   A piston.  

# Piston Construction  

The majority of aircraft engine pistons are machined from  aluminum alloy forgings. Grooves are machined in the  outside surface of the piston to receive the piston rings, and  cooling fins are provided on the inside of the piston for greater  heat transfer to the engine oil.  

Pistons may be either the trunk type or the slipper type.  [Figure 1-14]  Slipper-type pistons are not used in modern,  high-powered engines because they do not provide adequate  strength or wear resistance. The top of the piston, or head,  may be flat, convex, or concave. Recesses may be machined  in the piston head to prevent interference with the valves.  

Modern engines use cam ground pistons that are a larger  diameter perpendicular to the piston pin. This larger diameter  keeps the piston straight in the cylinder as the engine warms  up from initial startup. As the piston heats up during warm  up, the part of the piston in line with the pin has more mass  and expands more making the piston completely round.  At low temperatures, the piston is oval shaped and, when  it warms to operating temperature, it becomes round. This  process reduces the tendency of the piston to cock or slap in  the cylinder during warm up. When the engine reaches its  normal operating temperature, the piston assumes the correct  dimensions in the cylinder.  

As many as six grooves may be machined around the  piston to accommodate the compression rings and oil rings.  [Figure 1-15]  The compression rings are installed in the  three uppermost grooves; the oil control rings are installed  immediately above the piston pin. The piston is usually  drilled at the oil control ring grooves to allow surplus oil  scraped from the cylinder walls by the oil control rings to  pass back into the crankcase. An oil scraper ring is installed  at the base of the piston wall or skirt to prevent excessive oil  consumption. The portions of the piston walls that lie between  

![](images/9b0b99ff3d4c6d941356be18ac079ab91f6c11c3991ea36c54745f3ec50d2a5e.jpg)  
Figure 1-14.   Piston assembly and types of pistons.  

ring grooves are called the ring lands. In addition to acting  as a guide for the piston head, the piston skirt incorporates  the piston-pin bosses. The piston-pin bosses are of heavy  construction to enable the heavy load on the piston head to  be transferred to the piston pin.  

# Piston Pin  

The piston pin joins the piston to the connecting rod. It is  machined in the form of a tube from a nickel steel alloy  forging, casehardened, and ground. The piston pin is  sometimes called a wristpin because of the similarity between  the relative motions of the piston and the articulated rod and  that of the human arm. The piston pin used in modern aircraft  engines is the full-floating type, so called because the pin is  free to rotate in both the piston and in the connecting rod  piston-pin bearing. The piston pin must be held in place to  prevent the pin ends from scoring the cylinder walls. A plug  of relatively soft aluminum in the pin end provides a good  bearing surface against the cylinder wall.  

# Piston Rings  

The piston rings prevent leakage of gas pressure from the  combustion chamber and reduce to a minimum the seepage  of oil into the combustion chamber.  [Figure 1-15]  The rings  fit into the piston grooves but spring out to press against the  cylinder walls; when properly lubricated, the rings form an  effective gas seal.  

# Piston Ring Construction  

Most piston rings are made of high-grade cast iron.  [Figure 1-14]  After the rings are made, they are ground to  

![](images/5e666570827c264e8fc26a4d28f3652a41a13c52e0e597a168d91ee9bc9ec1fc.jpg)  
Figure 1-15.   Machined rings around a piston.  

the cross-section desired. Then they are split so that they can  be slipped over the outside of the piston and into the ring  grooves that are machined in the piston wall. Since their  purpose is to seal the clearance between the piston and the  cylinder wall, they must fit the cylinder wall snugly enough  to provide a gastight fit. They must exert equal pressure at  all points on the cylinder wall and must make a gastight fit  against the sides of the ring grooves.  

Gray cast iron is most often used in making piston rings. In  some engines, chrome-plated mild steel piston rings are used  in the top compression ring groove because these rings can  better withstand the high temperatures present at this point.  Chrome rings must be used with steel cylinder walls. Never  use chrome rings on chrome cylinders.  

# Compression Ring  

The purpose of the compression rings is to prevent the escape  of combustion gases past the piston during engine operation.  They are placed in the ring grooves immediately below the  piston head. The number of compression rings used on each  piston is determined by the type of engine and its design,  although most aircraft engines use two compression rings  plus one or more oil control rings.  

The cross-section of the ring is either rectangular or wedge  shaped with a tapered face. The tapered face presents a narrow  bearing edge to the cylinder wall, which helps to reduce  friction and provide better sealing.  

# Oil Control Rings  

Oil control rings are placed in the grooves immediately below  the compression rings and above the piston pin bores. There  may be one or more oil control rings per piston; two rings  may be installed in the same groove, or they may be installed  in separate grooves. Oil control rings regulate the thickness  of the oil film on the cylinder wall. If too much oil enters the  combustion chamber, it burns and leaves a thick coating of  carbon on the combustion chamber walls, the piston head, the  spark plugs, and the valve heads. This carbon can cause the  valves and piston rings to stick if it enters the ring grooves  or valve guides. In addition, the carbon can cause spark plug  misfiring as well as detonation, pre-ignition, or excessive  oil consumption. To allow the surplus oil to return to the  crankcase, holes are drilled in the bottom of the oil control  piston ring grooves or in the lands next to these grooves.  

# Oil Scraper Ring  

The oil scraper ring usually has a beveled face and is installed  in the groove at the bottom of the piston skirt. The ring is  installed with the scraping edge away from the piston head  or in the reverse position, depending upon cylinder position  and the engine series. In the reverse position, the scraper ring  retains the surplus oil above the ring on the upward piston  stroke, and this oil is returned to the crankcase by the oil  control rings on the downward stroke.  

# Cylinders  

The portion of the engine in which the power is developed  is called the cylinder.  [Figure 1-16]  The cylinder provides  a combustion chamber where the burning and expansion of  gases take place, and it houses the piston and the connecting  rod. There are four major factors that need to be considered in  the design and construction of the cylinder assembly. It must:  

1. 	 Be strong enough to withstand the internal pressures  developed during engine operation. 2. 	 Be constructed of a lightweight metal to keep down  engine weight. 3.	 Have good heat-conducting properties for efficient  cooling. 4. 	 Be comparatively easy and inexpensive to manufacture,  inspect, and maintain.  

The cylinder head of an air cooled engine is generally made of  aluminum alloy because aluminum alloy is a good conductor  of heat and its light weight reduces the overall engine weight.  Cylinder heads are forged or die-cast for greater strength. The  inner shape of a cylinder head is generally semispherical.  The semispherical shape is stronger than conventionalist  

![](images/9e18921a6801cbb74dec52b2717341d8ad59927598eab024a86520a91f92cdd7.jpg)  
Figure 1-16.   An example of an engine cylinder.  

design and aids in a more rapid and thorough scavenging of  the exhaust gases.  

The cylinder used in the air cooled engine is the overhead  valve type.  [Figure 1-17]  Each cylinder is an assembly of two  major parts: cylinder head and cylinder barrel. At assembly,  the cylinder head is expanded by heating and then screwed  down on the cylinder barrel, which has been chilled. When  the head cools and contracts and the barrel warms up and  expands, a gastight joint results. The majority of the cylinders  used are constructed in this manner using an aluminum head  and a steel barrel.  [Figure 1-18]  

# Cylinder Heads  

The purpose of the cylinder head is to provide a place for  combustion of the air-fuel mixture and to give the cylinder  more heat conductivity for adequate cooling. The air-fuel  mixture is ignited by the spark in the combustion chamber  and commences burning as the piston travels toward top  dead center (top of its travel) on the compression stroke. The  ignited charge is rapidly expanding at this time, and pressure  is increasing so that, as the piston travels through the top dead  center position, it is driven downward on the power stroke.

Figure 1-17.   Cutaway view of the cylinder assembly.  

The intake and exhaust valve ports are located in the cylinder  head along with the spark plugs and the intake and exhaust  valve actuating mechanisms.  

After the cylinder head is cast, the spark plug bushings, valve  guides, rocker arm bushings, and valve seats are installed in  the cylinder head. Spark plug openings may be fitted with  bronze or steel bushings that are shrunk and screwed into the openings. Stainless steel Heli-Coil spark plug inserts  are used in many engines currently manufactured. Bronze or  steel valve guides are usually shrunk or screwed into drilled  openings in the cylinder head to provide guides for the valve  stems. These are generally located at an angle to the center  line of the cylinder. The valve seats are circular rings of  hardened metal that protect the relatively soft metal of the  cylinder head from the hammering action of the valves (as  they open and close) and from the exhaust gases.  

The cylinder heads of air cooled engines are subjected to  extreme temperatures; it is therefore necessary to provide  adequate cooling fin area and to use metals that conduct heat  rapidly. Cylinder heads of air cooled engines are usually cast  or forged. Aluminum alloy is used in the construction for a  number of reasons. It is well adapted for casting or for the  machining of deep, closely spaced fins, and it is more resistant  than most metals to the corrosive attack of tetraethyl lead in  gasoline. The greatest improvement in air cooling has resulted  from reducing the thickness of the fins and increasing their  depth. In this way, the fin area has been increased in modern  engines. Cooling fins taper from  $0.090"$   at the base to  $0.060"$  at the tip end. Because of the difference in temperature in  the various sections of the cylinder head, it is necessary to  provide more cooling-fin area on some sections than on  others. The exhaust valve region is the hottest part of the  internal surface; therefore, more fin area is provided around  the outside of the cylinder in this section.

Figure 1-18.   The aluminum head and steel barrel of a cylinder.  

# Cylinder Barrels  

The cylinder barrel in which the piston operates must be  made of a high-strength material, usually steel. It must be  as light as possible yet have the proper characteristics for  operating under high temperatures. It must be made of a  good bearing material and have high tensile strength. The  cylinder barrel is made of a steel alloy forging with the inner  surface hardened to resist wear of the piston and the piston  rings which bear against it. This hardening is usually done  by exposing the steel to ammonia or cyanide gas while the  steel is very hot. The steel soaks up nitrogen from the gas,  which forms iron nitrides on the exposed surface. As a result  of this process, the metal is said to be nitrided. This nitriding  only penetrates into the barrel surface a few thousands of an  inch. As the cylinder barrels wear due to use, they can be  repaired by chroming. This is a process that plates chromium  on the surface of the cylinder barrel and brings it back to new  standard dimensions. Chromium-plated cylinders should use  cast iron rings. Honing the cylinder walls is a process that  brings it to the correct dimensions and provides crosshatch  pattern for seating the piston rings during engine break-in.  Some engine cylinder barrels are choked at the top, or they  are smaller in diameter to allow for heat expansion and wear.  

In some instances, the barrel has threads on the outside  surface at one end so that it can be screwed into the cylinder  head. The cooling fins are machined as an integral part of  the barrel and have limits on repair and service.  

# Cylinder Numbering  

Occasionally, it is necessary to refer to the left or right side  of the engine or to a particular cylinder. Therefore, it is  necessary to know the engine directions and how cylinders of  an engine are numbered. The propeller shaft end of the engine  is always the front end, and the accessory end is the rear end,  regardless of how the engine is mounted in an aircraft. When  referring to the right side or left side of an engine, always  assume the view is from the rear or accessory end. As seen  from this position, crankshaft rotation is referred to as either  clockwise or counterclockwise.  

Inline and V-type engine cylinders are usually numbered from  the rear. In V-engines, the cylinder banks are known as the  right bank and the left bank, as viewed from the accessory end.  [Figure 1-19]  The cylinder numbering of the opposed engine  shown begins with the right rear as No. 1 and the left rear as  No. 2. The one forward of No. 1 is No. 3; the one forward of  No. 2 is No. 4, and so on. The numbering of opposed engine  cylinders is by no means standard. Some manufacturers  number their cylinders from the rear and others from the front  of the engine. Always refer to the appropriate engine manual  to determine the numbering system used by that manufacturer.  

Single-row radial engine cylinders are numbered clockwise  when viewed from the rear. Cylinder No. 1 is the top cylinder.  In double-row engines, the same system is used. The No. 1  cylinder is the top one in the rear row. No. 2 cylinder is the  first one clockwise from No. 1, but No. 2 is in the front row.  No. 3 cylinder is the next one clockwise to No. 2 but is in  the rear row. Thus, all odd-numbered cylinders are in the rear  row, and all even-numbered cylinders are in the front row.  

# Firing Order  

The firing order of an engine is the sequence in which the  power event occurs in the different cylinders. The firing order  is designed to provide for balance and to eliminate vibration  to the greatest extent possible. In radial engines, the firing  order must follow a special pattern since the firing impulses  must follow the motion of the crank throw during its rotation.  In inline engines, the firing orders may vary somewhat, yet  most orders are arranged so that the firing of cylinders is  evenly distributed along the crankshaft. Six-cylinder inline  engines generally have a firing order of 1-5-3-6-2-4. Cylinder  firing order in opposed engines can usually be listed in pairs  of cylinders, as each pair fires across the center main bearing.  The firing order of six-cylinder opposed engines is 1-4-5- 2-3-6. The firing order of one model four-cylinder opposed  engine is 1-4-2-3, but on another model, it is 1-3-2-4.  

# Single-Row Radial Engines  

On a single-row radial engine, all the odd-numbered cylinders  fire in numerical succession; then, the even numbered  cylinders fire in numerical succession. On a five-cylinder  radial engine, for example, the firing order is 1-3-5-2-4, and  on a seven-cylinder radial engine it is 1-3-5-7-2-4-6. The firing  order of a nine-cylinder radial engine is 1-3-5-7-9-2-4-6-8.  

# Double-Row Radial Engines  

On a double-row radial engine, the firing order is somewhat  complicated. The firing order is arranged with the firing  impulse occurring in a cylinder in one row and then in a  cylinder in the other row; therefore, two cylinders in the  same row never fire in succession.  

An easy method for computing the firing order of a  14-cylinder, double-row radial engine is to start with any  number from 1 to 14 and add 9 or subtract 5 (these are called  the firing order numbers), whichever gives an answer between  1 and 14, inclusive. For example, starting with 8, 9 cannot be  added since the answer would then be more than 14; therefore,  subtract 5 from 8 to get 3, add 9 to 3 to get 12, subtract 5 from  12 to get 7, subtract 5 from 7 to get 2, and so on.  

The firing order numbers of an 18-cylinder, double-row radial  engine are 11 and 7; that is, begin with any number from 1 to  18 and add 11 or subtract 7. For example, beginning with 1,  add 11 to get 12; 11 cannot be added to 12 because the total  would be more than 18, so subtract 7 to get 5, add 11 to 5 to get  16, subtract 7 from 16 to get 9, subtract 7 from 9 to get 2, add  11 to 2 to get 13, and continue this process for 18 cylinders.  

# Valves  

The air-fuel mixture enters the cylinders through the intake  valve ports, and burned gases are expelled through the  exhaust valve ports. The head of each valve opens and closes  these cylinder ports. The valves used in aircraft engines are  the conventional poppet type. The valves are also typed by  their shape and are called either mushroom or tulip because  of their resemblance to the shape of these plants.  Figure 1-20 illustrates various shapes and types of these valves.  

![](images/829ab19e927021950b36d4dc6a666e13f0c4ebc3eadbd04adc448e19d1bb6fdc.jpg)  
Figure 1-19.   Numbering of engine cylinders.  

# Valve Construction  

The valves in the cylinders of an aircraft engine are subjected  to high temperatures, corrosion, and operating stresses; thus,  the metal alloy in the valves must be able to resist all these  factors. Because intake valves operate at lower temperatures  than exhaust valves, they can be made of chromic-nickel  steel. Exhaust valves are usually made of nichrome,  silchrome, or cobalt-chromium steel because these materials  are much more heat resistant.  

The valve head has a ground face that forms a seal against  the ground valve seat in the cylinder head when the valve is  closed. The face of the valve is usually ground to an angle  of either   $30^{\circ}$   or  $45^{\circ}$  . In some engines, the intake-valve face  is ground to an angle of   $30^{\circ}$  , and the exhaust-valve face is  ground to a   $45^{\circ}$   angle. Valve faces are often made more  durable by the application of a material called stellite. About   $\%$   inch of this alloy is welded to the valve face and ground  to the correct angle. Stellite is resistant to high-temperature  corrosion and also withstands the shock and wear associated  with valve operation. Some engine manufacturers use a  nichrome facing on the valves. This serves the same purpose  as the stellite material.

Figure 1-20.   Various valve types.  

the valve guide installed in the cylinder head for this purpose.  [Figure 1-21]  The valve stem is surface hardened to resist wear.  The neck is the part that forms the junction between the head  and the stem. The tip of the valve is hardened to withstand the  hammering of the valve rocker arm as it opens the valve. A  machined groove on the stem near the tip receives the split-ring  stem keys. These stem keys form a lock ring to hold the valve  spring retaining washer in place.  [Figure 1-22]  

Some intake and exhaust valve stems are hollow and  partially filled with metallic sodium. This material is used  because it is an excellent heat conductor. The sodium melts  at approximately   $208~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and the reciprocating motion of  the valve circulates the liquid sodium, allowing it to carry  away heat from the valve head to the valve stem where it  is dissipated through the valve guide to the cylinder head  and the cooling fins. Thus, the operating temperature of the  valve may be reduced as much as   $300^{\circ}$   to   $400\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Under  no circumstances should a sodium-filled valve be cut open

or subjected to treatment which may cause it to rupture.  Exposure of the sodium in these valves to the outside air  results in fire or explosion with possible personal injury.  

The most commonly used intake valves have solid stems,  and the head is either flat or tulip shaped. Intake valves for  low-power engines are usually flat headed. In some engines,  the intake valve may be the tulip type and have a smaller stem  than the exhaust valve or it may be similar to the exhaust  valve but have a solid stem and head. Although these valves  are similar, they are not interchangeable since the faces of the  valves are constructed of different material. The intake valve  usually has a flat milled on the tip to identify it.  

# Valve Operating Mechanism  

For a reciprocating engine to operate properly, each valve  must open at the proper time, stay open for the required  length of time, and close at the proper time. Intake valves  are opened just before the piston reaches top dead center,  and exhaust valves remain open after top dead center. At  a particular instant, therefore, both valves are open at the  same time (end of the exhaust stroke and beginning of the  intake stroke). This valve overlap permits better volumetric  efficiency and lowers the cylinder operating temperature.  This timing of the valves is controlled by the valve-operating  mechanism and is referred to as the valve timing.  

The valve lift (distance that the valve is lifted off its seat) and  the valve duration (length of time the valve is held open) are  both determined by the shape of the cam lobes. Typical cam  lobes are illustrated in  Figure 1-23 . The portion of the lobe  that gently starts the valve operating mechanism moving is  called a ramp, or step. The ramp is machined on each side of  

![](images/1c284054e275d15b659fdc65f2557ed9ebe365ab48c1826f694c4b243249d080.jpg)

the cam lobe to permit the rocker arm to be eased into contact  with the valve tip and thus reduce the shock load which would  otherwise occur. The valve operating mechanism consists of a  cam ring or camshaft equipped with lobes that work against a  cam roller or a cam follower.  [Figures 1-24  and  1-25]  The cam  follower pushes a push rod and ball socket, actuating a rocker  arm, which in turn opens the valve. Springs, which slip over  the stem of the valves and are held in place by the valve-spring  retaining washer and stem key, close each valve and push the  valve mechanism in the opposite direction.  [Figure 1-26]  

# Cam Rings  

The valve mechanism of a radial engine is operated by one or  two cam rings, depending upon the number of rows of cylinders.  In a single-row radial engine, one ring with a double cam  track is used. One track operates the intake valves, the other  

![](images/046d1b408c22e217549f1db5cd4c16887d82ad827ea2e0f89a88184f59f7c24f.jpg)  
Figure 1-25.   Valve-operating mechanism (opposed engine).  

operates the exhaust valves. The cam ring is a circular piece of  steel with a series of cams or lobes on the outer surface. The  surface of these lobes and the space between them (on which  the cam rollers ride) is known as the cam track. As the cam ring  revolves, the lobes cause the cam roller to raise the tappet in the  tappet guide, thereby transmitting the force through the push  rod and rocker arm to open the valve. In a single-row radial  engine, the cam ring is usually located between the propeller  reduction gearing and the front end of the power section. In a  twin-row radial engine, a second cam for the operation of the  valves in the rear row is installed between the rear end of the  power section and the supercharger section.  

The cam ring is mounted concentrically with the crankshaft  and is driven by the crankshaft at a reduced rate of speed  

![](images/9b38fd418cff9a57319ec9cc864187de4adf461e88fad62272d1f793864bde0f.jpg)

through the cam intermediate drive gear assembly. The cam  ring has two parallel sets of lobes spaced around the outer  periphery, one set (cam track) for the intake valves and the  other for the exhaust valves. The cam rings used may have  four or five lobes on both the intake and the exhaust tracks.  The timing of the valve events is determined by the spacing  of these lobes and the speed and direction at which the cam  rings are driven in relation to the speed and direction of the  crankshaft. The method of driving the cam varies on different  makes of engines. The cam ring can be designed with teeth  on either the inside or outside periphery. If the reduction  gear meshes with the teeth on the outside of the ring, the  cam turns in the direction of rotation of the crankshaft. If the  ring is driven from the inside, the cam turns in the opposite  direction from the crankshaft.  [Figure 1-24]  

A four-lobe cam may be used on either a seven-cylinder or  nine-cylinder engine.  [Figure 1-27]  On the seven cylinder,  it rotates in the same direction as the crankshaft, and on the  nine cylinder, opposite the crankshaft rotation. On the nine- cylinder engine, the spacing between cylinders is   $40^{\circ}$   and  the firing order is 1-3-5-7-9-2-4-6-8. This means that there  is a space of   $80^{\circ}$   between firing impulses. The spacing on  the four lobes of the cam ring is  $90°$  , which is greater than  the spacing between impulses. Therefore, to obtain proper  relation of valve operations and firing order, it is necessary  to drive the cam opposite the crankshaft rotation. Using the  four-lobe cam on the seven-cylinder engine, the spacing  between the firing of the cylinders is greater than the spacing  of the cam lobes. Therefore, it is necessary for the cam to  rotate in the same direction as the crankshaft.  

![Figure 1-27.   Radial engines, cam ring table. ](images/9e5867430c1069e7e8f02100ac17e80ff1a5579b26b21d4135490188c3bf4ffe.jpg)  

# Camshaft  

The valve mechanism of an opposed engine is operated by a  camshaft. The camshaft is driven by a gear that mates with  another gear attached to the crankshaft.  [Figure 1-28]  The  camshaft always rotates at one-half the crankshaft speed. As  the camshaft revolves, the lobes cause the tappet assembly  to rise in the tappet guide, transmitting the force through the  push rod and rocker arm to open the valve.  [Figure 1-29]  

# Tappet Assembly  

The tappet assembly consists of:  

1.	 A cylindrical tappet, which slides in and out in a tappet  guide installed in one of the crankcase sections around  the cam ring; 2.	 A tappet roller, which follows the contour of the cam  ring and lobes; 3.	 A tappet ball socket or push rod socket; and 4.	 A tappet spring.  

![](images/203800e3526d6b21eb9ad0399cd1c05af332495b37eddd120df8ec4c427350bc.jpg)

Figure 1-29.   Cam load on lifter body.  

The function of the tappet assembly is to convert the rotational  movement of the cam lobe into reciprocating motion and to  transmit this motion to the push rod, rocker arm, and then  to the valve tip, opening the valve at the proper time. The  purpose of the tappet spring is to take up the clearance  between the rocker arm and the valve tip to reduce the shock  load when the valve is opened. A hole is drilled through the  tappet to allow engine oil to flow to the hollow push rods to  lubricate the rocker assemblies.  

# Solid Lifters/Tappets  

Solid lifters or cam followers generally require the valve  clearance to be adjusted manually by adjusting a screw and  lock nut. Valve clearance is needed to assure that the valve  has enough clearance in the valve train to close completely.  This adjustment or inspection was a continuous maintenance  item until hydraulic lifters were used.  

# Hydraulic Valve Tappets/Lifters  

Some aircraft engines incorporate hydraulic tappets that  automatically keep the valve clearance at zero, eliminating  the necessity for any valve clearance adjustment mechanism.  A typical hydraulic tappet (zero-lash valve lifter) is shown  in  Figure 1-30 .  

When the engine valve is closed, the face of the tappet body 

 (cam follower) is on the base circle or back of the cam. 

 [Figure 1-30]  The light plunger spring lifts the hydraulic  plunger so that its outer end contacts the push rod socket,  exerting a light pressure against it, thus eliminating any  clearance in the valve linkage. As the plunger moves outward,  the ball check valve moves off its seat. Oil from the supply  chamber, which is directly connected with the engine  lubrication system, flows in and fills the pressure chamber. As  the camshaft rotates, the cam pushes the tappet body and the  

![](images/cd7c51a7ff375f4af8e10e12ce0252f47ba056a71409ba76db6a4ec2abdb1910.jpg)  
Figure 1-30.   Hydraulic valve tappets.  

hydraulic lifter cylinder outward. This action forces the ball  check valve onto its seat; thus, the body of oil trapped in the  pressure chamber acts as a cushion. During the interval when  the engine valve is off its seat, a predetermined leakage occurs  between plunger and cylinder bore, which compensates for  any expansion or contraction in the valve train. Immediately  after the engine valve closes, the amount of oil required to  fill the pressure chamber flows in from the supply chamber,  preparing for another cycle of operation.  

Hydraulic valve lifters are normally adjusted at the time of  overhaul. They are assembled dry (no lubrication), clearances  checked, and adjustments are usually made by using push  rods of different lengths. A minimum and maximum valve  clearance is established. Any measurement between these  extremes is acceptable, but approximately half way between  the extremes is desired. Hydraulic valve lifters require less  maintenance, are better lubricated, and operate more quietly  than the screw adjustment type.  

# Push Rod  

The push rod, tubular in form, transmits the lifting force from  the valve tappet to the rocker arm. A hardened-steel ball is  pressed over or into each end of the tube. One ball end fits into  the socket of the rocker arm. In some instances, the balls are  on the tappet and rocker arm, and the sockets are on the push  rod. The tubular form is employed because of its lightness and  strength. It permits the engine lubricating oil under pressure  to pass through the hollow rod and the drilled ball ends to  lubricate the ball ends, rocker-arm bearing, and valve-stem  guide. The push rod is enclosed in a tubular housing that  extends from the crankcase to the cylinder head, referred to  as push rod tubes.  

# Rocker Arms  

The rocker arms transmit the lifting force from the cams  to the valves.  [Figure 1-31]  Rocker arm assemblies are  supported by a plain, roller, or ball bearing, or a combination  of these, which serves as a pivot. Generally, one end of the  arm bears against the push rod and the other bears on the  valve stem. One end of the rocker arm is sometimes slotted  to accommodate a steel roller. The opposite end is constructed  with either a threaded split clamp and locking bolt or a tapped  hole. The arm may have an adjusting screw, for adjusting  the clearance between the rocker arm and the valve stem  tip. The screw can be adjusted to the specified clearance to  make certain that the valve closes fully.  

# Valve Springs  

Each valve is closed by two or three helical springs. If a single  spring were used, it would vibrate or surge at certain speeds.  To eliminate this difficulty, two or more springs (one inside  the other) are installed on each valve. Each spring vibrates  at a different engine speed and rapid damping out of all  spring-surge vibrations during engine operation results. Two  or more springs also reduce danger of weakness and possible  failure by breakage due to heat and metal fatigue. The springs  are held in place by split locks installed in the recess of the  valve spring upper retainer or washer, and engage a groove  machined into the valve stem. The functions of the valve  springs are to close the valve and to hold the valve securely  on the valve seat.  

![](images/351d72bc900a2bb667ff702e611a6f2052a39355477364764339826cd6c54884.jpg)

# Bearings  

A bearing is any surface which supports, or is supported by,  another surface. A good bearing must be composed of material  that is strong enough to withstand the pressure imposed on it  and should permit the other surface to move with a minimum  of friction and wear. The parts must be held in position within  very close tolerances to provide efficient and quiet operation,  and yet allow freedom of motion. Lubricated bearings of  many types are used to accomplish this, and at the same  time reduce friction of moving parts so that power loss is  not excessive and to prevent high oil temperatures caused  by failed or failing bearings. Bearings are required to take  radial loads, thrust loads, or a combination of the two. An  example of a radial load would be a rotating shaft being held  or contained in one position on a radial plane. Thrust load  would be the rotating shaft being contained from moving  axially along the shafts axis. These radial and thrust loads  are illustrated in  Figure 1-32 . There are two ways in which  bearing surfaces move in relation to each other. One is by  the sliding movement of one metal against the other (sliding  friction), and the second is for one surface to roll over the  other (rolling friction). The three different types of bearings  in general use are plain, roller, and ball.  [Figure 1-33]  

# Plain Bearings  

Plain bearings are generally used for the crankshaft, cam  ring, camshaft, connecting rods, and the accessory drive shaft  bearings. Such bearings are usually subjected to radial loads  only, although some have been designed to take thrust loads.  Plain bearings are usually made of nonferrous (having no  iron) metals, such as silver, bronze, aluminum, and various  alloys of copper, tin, or lead. Master rod or crankpin bearings  in some engines are thin shells of steel, plated with silver on  both the inside and the outside surfaces and with lead-tin  plated over the silver on the inside surface only. Smaller  bearings, such as those used to support various shafts in the  accessory section, are called bushings. Porous Oilite bushings  are widely used in this instance. They are impregnated with  oil so that the heat of friction brings the oil to the bearing  surface during engine operation.  

# Ball Bearings  

A ball bearing assembly consists of grooved inner and outer  races, one or more sets of balls, in bearings designed for  disassembly, and a bearing retainer. They are used for shaft  bearings and rocker arm bearings in some reciprocating  engines. Special deep-groove ball bearings are used to  transmit propeller thrust and radial loads to the engine nose  section of radial engines. Since this type of bearing can accept  both radial and thrust loads, it is used in gas turbine engines  to support one end of a shaft (radial loads) and to keep the  shaft from moving axially (thrust loads).  

# Roller Bearings  

Roller bearings are made in many types and shapes, but the  two types generally used in the aircraft engine are the straight  roller and the tapered roller bearings. Straight roller bearings  are used where the bearing is subjected to radial loads only.  In tapered roller bearings, the inner- and outer-race bearing  surfaces are cone-shaped. Such bearings withstand both  radial and thrust loads. Straight roller bearings are used in  high power reciprocating aircraft engines for the crankshaft  main bearings. They are also used in gas turbine applications  where radial loads are high. Generally, a rotating shaft in a  gas turbine engine is supported by a deep-groove ball bearing

(radial and thrust loads) on one end and a straight roller  bearing (radial loads only) on the other end.  

# Propeller Reduction Gearing  

The increased brake horsepower delivered by a high  horsepower engine results partly from increased crankshaft  rpm. It is therefore necessary to provide reduction gears to  limit the propeller rotation speed to a value at which efficient  operation is obtained. Whenever the speed of the blade tips  approaches the speed of sound, the efficiency of the propeller  decreases rapidly. Reduction gearing for engines allows the  engine to operate at a higher rpm, developing more power  while slowing down the propeller rpm. This prevents the  propeller efficiency from decreasing. Since reduction gearing  must withstand extremely high stresses, the gears are machined  from steel forgings. Many types of reduction gearing systems  are in use. The three types most commonly used are spur  planetary, bevel planetary, and spur and pinion. [ Figure 1-34 ]  

The spur planetary reduction gearing consists of a large  driving gear or sun gear splined (and sometimes shrunk)  to the crankshaft, a large stationary gear, called a bell gear,  and a set of small spur planetary pinion gears mounted on a  carrier ring. The ring is fastened to the propeller shaft and the  planetary gears mesh with both the sun gear and the stationary  bell or ring gear. The stationary gear is bolted or splined to  the front section housing. When the engine is operating, the  sun gear rotates. Because the planetary gears are meshed with  this ring, they also must rotate. Since they also mesh with the  stationary gear, they walk or roll around it as they rotate, and  the ring in which they are mounted rotates the propeller shaft  in the same direction as the crankshaft but at a reduced speed.  

In some engines, the bell gear is mounted on the propeller  shaft, and the planetary pinion gear cage is held stationary.  The sun gear is splined to the crankshaft and acts as a  driving gear. In such an arrangement, the propeller travels at  a reduced speed but in opposite direction to the crankshaft.  

In the bevel planetary reduction gearing system, the driving  gear is machined with beveled external teeth and is attached to  the crankshaft. A set of mating bevel pinion gears is mounted  in a cage attached to the end of the propeller shaft. The  pinion gears are driven by the drive gear and walk around the  stationary gear, which is bolted or splined to the front section  housing. The thrust of the bevel pinion gears is absorbed by a  thrust ball bearing of special design. The drive and the fixed  gears are generally supported by heavy-duty ball bearings.  This type of planetary reduction assembly is more compact  than the other one described and, therefore, can be used  where a smaller propeller gear step-down is desired. In the  case of gas turbine turboprop engines, more than one stage  of reduction gearing is used due to the high output speeds of  the engine. Several types of lower powered engines can use  the spur and pinion reduction gear arrangement.  

# Propeller Shafts  

Propeller shafts may be of three major types: tapered, splined,  or flanged. Tapered shafts are identified by taper numbers.  Splined and flanged shafts are identified by SAE numbers.  The propeller shaft of most low power output engines is  forged as part of the crankshaft. It is tapered, and a milled  slot is provided so that the propeller hub can be keyed to  the shaft. The keyway and key index of the propeller are in  relation to the No. 1 cylinder top dead center. The end of the  shaft is threaded to receive the propeller retaining nut. Tapered  propeller shafts are common on older and smaller engines.  

The propeller shaft of high-output radial engines is generally  

![](images/0e35882e8bbcfbe8cb569a0f234571e0381a54f41a61b0a3ef4dafadd71d25bb.jpg)  
Figure 1-34.   Reduction gears.  

splined. It is threaded on one end for a propeller hub nut.  The thrust bearing, which absorbs propeller thrust, is located  around the shaft and transmits the thrust to the nose section  housing. The shaft is threaded for attaching the thrust-bearing  retaining nut. On the portion protruding from the housing  (between the two sets of threads), splines are located to  receive the splined propeller hub. The shaft is generally  machined from a steel-alloy forging throughout its length.  The propeller shaft may be connected by reduction gearing  to the engine crankshaft, but in smaller engines the propeller  

shaft is simply an extension of the engine crankshaft. To  turn the propeller shaft, the engine crankshaft must revolve.  

Flanged propeller shafts are used on most modern  reciprocating and turboprop engines. One end of the shaft is  flanged with drilled holes to accept the propeller mounting  bolts. The installation may be a short shaft with internal  threading to accept the distributor valve to be used with a  controllable propeller. The flanged propeller shaft is a very  common installation on most propeller driven aircraft.  

# Reciprocating Engine Operating Principles  

The relationships between pressure, volume, and temperature  of gases are the basic principles of engine operation. An  internal combustion engine is a device for converting heat  energy into mechanical energy. Gasoline is vaporized and  mixed with air, forced or drawn into a cylinder, compressed  by a piston, and then ignited by an electric spark. The  conversion of the resultant heat energy into mechanical  energy and then into work is accomplished in the cylinder.  Figure 1-35  illustrates the various engine components  necessary to accomplish this conversion and also presents  the principal terms used to indicate engine operation.  

The operating cycle of an internal combustion reciprocating  engine includes the series of events required to induct,  compress, ignite, and burn, causing expansion of the air- fuel charge in the cylinder and to scavenge or exhaust the  byproducts of the combustion process. When the compressed  mixture is ignited, the resultant gases of combustion expand  very rapidly and force the piston to move away from the  cylinder head. This downward motion of the piston, acting  on the crankshaft through the connecting rod, is converted to  a circular or rotary motion by the crankshaft. A valve in the  top or head of the cylinder opens to allow the burned gases to  escape, and the momentum of the crankshaft and the propeller  forces the piston back up in the cylinder where it is ready for  the next event in the cycle. Another valve in the cylinder   head  then opens to let in a fresh charge of the air-fuel mixture. The  valve allowing for the escape of the burning exhaust gases  is called the exhaust valve, and the valve which lets in the  fresh charge of the air-fuel mixture is called the intake valve.  These valves are opened and closed mechanically at the  proper times by the valve-operating mechanism. Therefore,  the order of the five events of a four stroke cycle engine are  intake, compression, ignition, power, and exhaust.  

The bore of a cylinder is its inside diameter. The stroke is the  distance the piston moves from one end of the cylinder to  the other, specifically from top dead center (TDC) to bottom  dead center (BDC), or vice versa.  [Figure 1-35]  

# Operating Cycles  

There are several operating cycles in use:  

1. 	 Four stroke. 2. 	 Two stroke.  3. 	 Rotary.  4. 	 Diesel.  

# Four-Stroke Cycle  

The vast majority of certified aircraft reciprocating engines  operate on the four-stroke cycle, sometimes called the Otto  cycle after its originator, a German physicist. The four-stroke  cycle engine has many advantages for use in aircraft. One  advantage is that it lends itself readily to high performance  through supercharging.  

In this type of engine, four strokes are required to complete the  required series of events or operating cycle of each cylinder.  [Figure 1-36]  Two complete revolutions of the crankshaft   $(720^{\circ})$   are required for the four strokes; thus, each cylinder in  an engine of this type fires once in every two revolutions of  the crankshaft. In the following discussion of the four-stroke  cycle engine operation, note that the timing of the ignition and  

![](images/fe88d3d04722f4aa77137918d72208ee6e0e40a369b4399179f46bdcdfc7b9ca.jpg)  
Figure 1-35.   Components and terminology of engine operation.  

the valve events vary considerably in different engines. Many  factors influence the timing of a specific engine, and it is most  important that the engine manufacturer’s recommendations  in this respect be followed in maintenance and overhaul. The  timing of the valve and ignition events is always specified in  degrees of crankshaft travel. It should be remembered that a  certain amount of crankshaft travel is required to open a valve  fully; therefore, the specified timing represents the start of  opening rather than the full-open position of the valve. An  example valve timing chart can be seen in  Figure 1-37 .  

# Intake Stroke  

During the intake stroke, the piston is pulled downward in  the cylinder by the rotation of the crankshaft. This reduces  the pressure in the cylinder and causes air under atmospheric  pressure to flow through the carburetor, which meters the  correct amount of fuel. The air-fuel mixture passes through  the intake pipes and intake valves into the cylinders. The  quantity or weight of the air-fuel charge depends upon the  degree of throttle opening.  

![](images/78d40d076a114343381cea8b8a9144f077e20bc58335c39e014ab600d0950c57.jpg)  
Figure 1-36.   Four-stroke cycle.

reaches TDC on the exhaust stroke, in order to induce a  greater quantity of the air-fuel charge into the cylinder and  thus increase the horsepower. The distance the valve may be  opened before TDC, however, is limited by several factors,  such as the possibility that hot gases remaining in the cylinder  from the previous cycle may flash back into the intake pipe  and the induction system.  

In all high-power aircraft engines, both the intake and the  exhaust valves are off the valve seats at TDC at the start  of the intake stroke. As mentioned above, the intake valve  opens before TDC on the exhaust stroke (valve lead), and the  closing of the exhaust valve is delayed considerably after the  piston has passed TDC and has started the intake stroke (valve  lag). This timing is called valve overlap and is designed  to aid in cooling the cylinder internally by circulating the  cool incoming air-fuel mixture, to increase the amount of  the air-fuel mixture induced into the cylinder, and to aid in  scavenging the byproducts of combustion from the cylinder.  

The intake valve is timed to close about  $50^{\circ}$   to  $75^{\circ}$   past BDC  on the compression stroke, depending upon the specific  engine, to allow the momentum of the incoming gases  to charge the cylinder more completely. Because of the  comparatively large volume of the cylinder above the piston  when the piston is near BDC, the slight upward travel of the  piston during this time does not have a great effect on the  incoming flow of gases. This late timing can be carried too  far because the gases may be forced back through the intake  valve and defeat the purpose of the late closing.  

# Compression Stroke  

After the intake valve is closed, the continued upward travel  of the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture to obtain the  desired burning and expansion characteristics. The charge is  fired by means of an electric spark as the piston approaches  TDC. The time of ignition varies from  $20^{\circ}$   to  $35^{\circ}$   before TDC,  depending upon the requirements of the specific engine to  ensure complete combustion of the charge by the time the  piston is slightly past the TDC position.  

Many factors affect ignition timing, and the engine  manufacturer has expended considerable time in research and  testing to determine the best setting. All engines incorporate  devices for adjusting the ignition timing, and it is most  important that the ignition system be timed according to the  engine manufacturer’s recommendations.  

# Power Stroke  

As the piston moves through the TDC position at the end  of the compression stroke and starts down on the power  stroke, it is pushed downward by the rapid expansion of the  burning gases within the cylinder head with a force that can  be greater than 15 tons   $(30{,}000\,\mathrm{psi)}$   at maximum power output  of the engine. The temperature of these burning gases may  be between  $3{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   and   $4{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   As the piston is forced  downward during the power stroke by the pressure of the  burning gases exerted upon it, the downward movement of  the connecting rod is changed to rotary movement by the  crankshaft. Then, the rotary movement is transmitted to the  propeller shaft to drive the propeller. As the burning gases  are expanded, the temperature drops to within safe limits  before the exhaust gases flow out through the exhaust port.  

The timing of the exhaust valve opening is determined by,  among other considerations, the desirability of using as much  of the expansive force as possible and of scavenging the  cylinder as completely and rapidly as possible. The valve is  opened considerably before BDC on the power stroke (on  some engines at  $50^{\circ}$   and  $75^{\circ}$   before BDC) while there is still  some pressure in the cylinder. This timing is used so that the  pressure can force the gases out of the exhaust port as soon  as possible. This process frees the cylinder of waste heat  after the desired expansion has been obtained and avoids  overheating the cylinder and the piston. Thorough scavenging  is very important, because any exhaust products remaining  in the cylinder dilute the incoming air-fuel charge at the start  of the next cycle.  

# Exhaust Stroke  

As the piston travels through BDC at the completion of the  power stroke and starts upward on the exhaust stroke, it  begins to push the burned exhaust gases out the exhaust port.  

The speed of the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder creates  a low pressure in the cylinder. This low or reduced pressure  speeds the flow of the fresh air-fuel charge into the cylinder  as the intake valve is beginning to open. The intake valve  opening is timed to occur at   $8^{\circ}$   to   $55^{\circ}$   before TDC on the  exhaust stroke on various engines.  

# Two-Stroke Cycle  

The two-stroke-cycle engine has re-emerged and is being  used in ultra-light, light sport, and many experimental  aircraft. As the name implies, two-stroke cycle engines  require only one upstroke and one down stroke of the piston  to complete the required series of events in the cylinder. Thus,  the engine completes the operating cycle in one revolution  of the crankshaft. The intake and exhaust functions are  accomplished during the same stroke. These engines can  be either air or water cooled and generally require a gear  reduction housing between the engine and propeller.  

# Rotary Cycle  

The rotary cycle has a three-sided rotor that turns inside an  elliptical housing, completing three of the four cycles for each  revolution. These engines can be single rotor or multi-rotor  and can be air or water cooled. They are used mostly with  experimental and light aircraft. Vibration characteristics are  also very low for this type of engine.  

# Diesel Cycle  

The diesel cycle depends on high compression pressures to  provide for the ignition of the air-fuel charge in the cylinder.  As air is drawn in the cylinder, it is compressed by a piston  and, at maximum pressure, fuel is sprayed in the cylinder. At  this point, the high pressure and temperature in the cylinder  causes the fuel to burn increasing the internal pressure of the  cylinder. This drives the piston down, turning or driving the  crankshaft. Water and air cooled engines that can operate on  JET A fuel (kerosene) use a version of the diesel cycle. There  are many types of diesel cycles in use including two-stroke  and four-stroke diesels.  

# Reciprocating Engine Power & Efficiencies  

All aircraft engines are rated according to their ability  to do work and produce power. This section presents an  explanation of work and power and how they are calculated.  Also discussed are the various efficiencies that govern the  power output of a reciprocating engine.  

# Work  

A physicist defines work as force times distance. Work done  by a force acting on a body is equal to the magnitude of the  force multiplied by the distance through which the force acts.  

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{work~(W)=Force~(F)\times D i s t a n c e~(D)}}
$$  

Work is measured by several standards. The most common  unit is called foot-pound (ft-lb). If a one-pound mass is raised  one foot, one ft-lb of work has been performed. The greater  the mass is and/or the greater the distance is, the greater the  work performed.  

# Horsepower  

The common unit of mechanical power is the horsepower  (hp). Late in the   $18^{\mathrm{th}}$   century, James Watt, the inventor of the  steam engine, found that an English workhorse could work  at the rate of 550 ft-lb per second, or 33,000 ft-lb per minute,  for a reasonable length of time. From his observations came  the unit of horsepower, which is the standard unit of  mechanical power in the English system of measurement. To  calculate the hp rating of an engine, divide the power  developed in ft-lb per minute by 33,000, or the power in ft-lb  per second by 550.  

![](images/ed124051159a08d0f4c52b702a760b29ca7ef787114b4e591c96a0fbbe29123b.jpg)  

As stated above, work is the product of force and distance,  and power is work per unit of time. Consequently, if a  33,000‑lb weight is lifted through a vertical distance of 1 foot  in 1 minute, the power expended is 33,000 ft-lb per minute,  or exactly 1 hp.  

Work is performed not only when a force is applied for lifting;  force may be applied in any direction. If a 100-lb weight is  dragged along the ground, a force is still being applied to  perform work, although the direction of the resulting motion  is approximately horizontal. The amount of this force would  depend upon the roughness of the ground.  

If the weight were attached to a spring scale graduated in  pounds, then dragged by pulling on the scale handle, the  amount of force required could be measured. Assume that  the force required is  $90\,1{\mathfrak{b}}$  , and the 100-lb weight is dragged  660 feet in 2 minutes. The amount of work performed in the  2 minutes is 59,400 ft-lb or 29,700 ft-lb per minute. Since 1  hp is 33,000 ft-lb per minute, the hp expended in this case is  29,700 divided by 33,000, or 0.9 hp.  

# Piston Displacement  

When other factors remain equal, the greater the piston  displacement, the greater the maximum horsepower an engine  is capable of developing. When a piston moves from BDC to  TDC, it displaces a specific volume. The volume displaced by  the piston is known as piston displacement and is expressed  in cubic inches for most American-made engines and cubic  centimeters for others.  

The piston displacement of one cylinder may be obtained  by multiplying the area of the cross-section of the cylinder  by the total distance the piston moves in the cylinder in one  stroke. For multicylinder engines, this product is multiplied  by the number of cylinders to get the total piston displacement  of the engine.  

Since the volume (V) of a geometric cylinder equals the area  (A) of the base multiplied by the height   $\mathrm{(h)}$  , it is expressed mathematically as follows:  

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{A}\times\mathrm{h}}
$$  

The area of the base is the area of the cross-section of the cylinder.  

# Area of a Circle  

To find the area of a circle, it is necessary to use a number  called pi   $(\pi)$  . This number represents the ratio of the  circumference to the diameter of any circle. Pi cannot be  stated exactly because it is a never-ending decimal. It is  3.1416 expressed to four decimal places, which is accurate  enough for most computations.  

The area of a circle, as in a rectangle or triangle, must be  expressed in square units. The distance that is one-half the  diameter of a circle is known as the radius. The area of any  circle is found by squaring the radius (r) and multiplying by   $\pi$  . The formula is as follows:  

$$
\boxed{\mathbf{A}=\pi\mathbf{r}^{2}}
$$  

The radius of a circle is equal to   $\%$   the diameter:  

$$
\left[\mathbf{r}={\frac{\mathbf{d}}{2}}\right]
$$  

# Example  

Compute the piston displacement of the PWA 14 cylinder  engine having a cylinder with a 5.5 inch diameter and a 5.5  inch stroke. Formulas required are:  

![](images/196e17b304f5e9f40c805ff9cc38cf096e09f0c37212ff701829eccbbd98e321.jpg)  

Substitute values into these formulas and complete the  calculation.  

![](images/853568f5f5d37ab3891baaa032ed763b23b38f72a02ef23d3b4ec0dbedccf97c.jpg)  

Rounded off to the next whole number, total piston  displacement equals 1,829 cubic inches.  

Another method of calculating the piston displacement uses  the diameter of the piston instead of the radius in the formula  for the area of the base.  

![](images/7b683780c8b6f16107ba932095786d77209a4329c443dc5148c8cd4dca61f1dd.jpg)  

From this point on, the calculations are identical to the  preceding example.  

# Compression Ratio  

All internal combustion engines must compress the air-fuel  mixture to receive a reasonable amount of work from each  power stroke. The air-fuel charge in the cylinder can be  compared to a coil spring in that the more it is compressed,  the more work it is potentially capable of doing.  

The compression ratio of an engine is a comparison of the  volume of space in a cylinder when the piston is at the bottom  of the stroke to the volume of space when the piston is at the  top of the stroke.  [Figure 1-38]  This comparison is expressed  as a ratio, hence the term compression ratio. Compression  ratio is a controlling factor in the maximum horsepower  developed by an engine, but it is limited by present day fuel  grades and the high engine speeds and manifold pressures  required for takeoff. For example, if there are 140 cubic  inches of space in the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom  and there are 20 cubic inches of space when the piston is at  the top of the stroke, the compression ratio would be 140  to 20. If this ratio is expressed in fraction form, it would be  140/20 or 7 to 1, usually represented as 7:1.  

pressures has a major effect on engine operation. Manifold  pressure is the average absolute pressure of the air or air-fuel  charge in the intake manifold and is measured in units of  inches of mercury  $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$  . Manifold pressure is dependent on  engine speed (throttle setting) and the degree supercharging.  The operation of the supercharger increases the weight of  the charge entering the cylinder. When a true supercharger  is used with the aircraft engine, the manifold pressure may  be considerably higher than the pressure of the outside  atmosphere. The advantage of this condition is that a greater  amount of charge is forced into a given cylinder volume, and  a greater output of horsepower results.  

Compression ratio and manifold pressure determine the  pressure in the cylinder in that portion of the operating cycle  when both valves are closed. The pressure of the charge  before compression is determined by manifold pressure,  while the pressure at the height of compression (just prior  to ignition) is determined by manifold pressure times the  compression ratio. For example, if an engine were operating  at a manifold pressure of   $30~"\mathrm{Hg}$   with a compression ratio  of 7:1, the pressure at the instant before ignition would be  approximately  $210\,^{\circ}\mathrm{Hg}$  . However, at a manifold pressure of   $60\ "\mathrm{Hg};$  , the pressure would be  $420\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .  

Without going into great detail, it has been shown that  the compression event magnifies the effect of varying the  manifold pressure, and the magnitude of both affects the  pressure of the fuel charge just before the instant of ignition.  If the pressure at this time becomes too high, pre-ignition  or detonation occur and produce overheating. Pre-ignition  is when the fuel air charge starts to burn before the spark  plug fires. Detonation occurs when the fuel air charge  is ignited by the spark plug, but instead of burning at a  controlled rate, it explodes causing cylinder temperatures  and pressures to spike very quickly. If this condition exists  for very long, the engine can be damaged or destroyed.  

One of the reasons for using engines with high compression  ratios is to obtain long-range fuel economy, to convert more  heat energy into useful work than is done in engines of low  compression ratio. Since more heat of the charge is converted  into useful work, less heat is absorbed by the cylinder walls.  This factor promotes cooler engine operation, which in turn  increases the thermal efficiency. Here again, a compromise  is needed between the demand for fuel economy and the  demand for maximum horsepower without detonation.  Some manufacturers of high compression engines suppress  detonation at high manifold pressures by using high octane  fuel and limiting maximum manifold pressure.  

The limitations placed on compression ratios, manifold  pressure, and the manifold pressure’s effect on compression  

# Indicated Horsepower  

The indicated horsepower produced by an engine is the  horsepower calculated from the indicated mean effective  pressure and the other factors which affect the power output  of an engine. Indicated horsepower is the power developed  in the combustion chambers without reference to friction  losses within the engine. This horsepower is calculated as  a function of the actual cylinder pressure recorded during  engine operation.  

To facilitate the indicated horsepower calculations, a  mechanical indicating device, such as is attached to the  engine cylinder, captures the actual pressure existing in the  cylinder during the complete operating cycle. This pressure  variation can be represented by the kind of graph shown in  Figure 1-39 . Notice that the cylinder pressure rises on the  compression stroke, reaches a peak after top center, and  decreases as the piston moves down on the power stroke.  Since the cylinder pressure varies during the operating cycle,  an average pressure (line AB) is computed. This average  pressure, if applied steadily during the time of the power  stroke, would do the same amount of work as the varying  pressure during the same period. This average pressure is  known as indicated mean effective pressure and is included  in the indicated horsepower calculation with other engine  specifications. If the characteristics and the indicated mean  effective pressure of an engine are known, it is possible to  calculate the indicated horsepower rating.  

The indicated horsepower for a four-stroke cycle engine can  be calculated from the following formula, in which the letter  symbols in the numerator are arranged to spell the word  “PLANK” to assist in memorizing the formula:  

$\mathrm{P}=$   Indicated mean effective pressure, in psi  $\mathrm{L}=$   Length of the stroke, in feet or in fractions of a foot  $\mathrm{A}=$   Area of the piston head or cross-sectional area of the   cylinder, in square inches  $\Nu=$   Number of power strokes per minute:   $\frac{\mathsf{r p m}}{2}$  

In the formula above, the area of the piston multiplied by the  indicated mean effective pressure gives the force acting on the  piston in pounds. This force multiplied by the length of the  stroke in feet gives the work performed in one power stroke,  which, multiplied by the number of power strokes per minute,  gives the number of ft-lb per minute of work produced by one  cylinder. Multiplying this result by the number of cylinders  in the engine gives the amount of work performed, in ft-lb,  by the engine. Since hp is defined as work done at the rate  of 33,000 ft-lb per minute, the total number of ft-lb of work  performed by the engine is divided by 33,000 to find the  indicated horsepower.

# Brake Horsepower  

The indicated horsepower calculation discussed in the  preceding paragraph is the theoretical power of a frictionless  engine. The total horsepower lost in overcoming friction  must be subtracted from the indicated horsepower to arrive at  the actual horsepower delivered to the propeller. The power  delivered to the propeller for useful work is known as brake  horsepower (bhp). The difference between indicated and  brake horsepower is known as friction horsepower, which  is the horsepower required to overcome mechanical losses,  such as the pumping action of the pistons, the friction of the  pistons, and the friction of all other moving parts.  

The measurement of an engine’s bhp involves the measurement  of a quantity known as torque or twisting moment. Torque  is the product of a force and the distance of the force from  the axis about which it acts, or  

$$
\boxed{\begin{array}{l l}{\mathrm{Torque}=\mathrm{force}\times\mathrm{distance}}\\ {\mathrm{(at\right\angles\to\the\force)}}\end{array}}
$$  

Torque is a measure of load and is properly expressed in  pound-inches (lb-in) or pound-feet (lb-ft). Torque should not  be confused with work, which is expressed in inch-pounds  (in-lb) or foot-pounds (ft-lb).  

There are numerous devices for measuring torque, such as a  dynamometer or a torque meter. One very simple type of  device that can be used to demonstrate torque calculations  is the Prony brake.  [Figure 1-40]  All of these torque- measuring devices are usable to calculate power output of  an engine on a test stand. It consists essentially of a hinged  collar, or brake, which can be clamped to a drum splined to  the propeller shaft. The collar and drum form a friction brake,  which can be adjusted by a wheel. An arm of a known length  is rigidly attached to or is a part of the hinged collar and  terminates at a point that rests on a set of scales. As the  propeller shaft rotates, it tends to carry the hinged collar of  the brake with it and is prevented from doing so only by the  arm that rests on the scale. The scale indicates the force  necessary to arrest the motion of the arm. If the resulting  force registered on the scale is multiplied by the length of  the arm, the resulting product is the torque exerted by the  rotating shaft. For example, if the scale registers 200 pounds  and the length of the arm is 3.18 feet, the torque exerted by  the shaft is:  

$$
\mathrm{\check{~}200\ l b\times3.18\ f t=636\ l b-f t}
$$  

Once the torque is known, the work done per revolution of  the propeller shaft can be computed without difficulty by the  equation:  

Work per revolution  =  2 π   x  torque  

![](images/d761435a817154ebcac2702e2829f1326d1abdc1bde409418c1f1151a44cc2e5.jpg)  
Figure 1-39.   Compression ratio.  

If work per revolution is multiplied by the rpm, the result is  work per minute, or power. If the work is expressed in ft-lb  per minute, this quantity is divided by 33,000. The result is  the brake horsepower of the shaft.  

![](images/48e3a81e0b9b267454f450d1ca7fbf89287f1c71f2b8fd6d9f2741948b755420.jpg)  

# Example  

![](images/d3774fee9fef3bba97c40146927bd8277c4930bc9429ce05038eb527b0ae3e76.jpg)  

As long as the friction between the brake collar and propeller  shaft drum is great enough to impose an appreciable load on  the engine, but is not great enough to stop the engine, it is  not necessary to know the amount of friction between the  collar and drum to compute the bhp. If there were no load  imposed, there would be no torque to measure, and the engine  would “run away.” If the imposed load is so great that the  engine stalls, there may be considerable torque to measure,  but there is no rpm. In either case, it is impossible to measure  the bhp of the engine. However, if a reasonable amount of  friction exists between the brake drum and the collar and the  load is then increased, the tendency of the propeller shaft to  carry the collar and arm about with it becomes greater, thus  imposing a greater force upon the scales. As long as the torque  increase is proportional to the rpm decrease, the horsepower  delivered at the shaft remains unchanged. This can be seen  from the equation in which  $2\pi\mathrm{r}$   and 33,000 are constants and  torque and rpm are variables. If the change in rpm is inversely  proportional to the change in torque, their product remains  unchanged, and bhp remains unchanged. This is important. It  shows that horsepower is the function of both torque and rpm,  and can be changed by changing either torque, rpm, or both.  

# Friction Horsepower  

Friction horsepower is the indicated horsepower minus  brake horsepower. It is the horsepower used by an engine  in overcoming the friction of moving parts, drawing in fuel,  expelling exhaust, driving oil and fuel pumps, and other  engine accessories. On modern aircraft engines, this power  loss through friction may be as high as 10 to 15 percent of  

![](images/a94b2a2aa05dbce8b46746d319002101a68e72dfde3ca2ab548f1234ba8cd031.jpg)  
Figure 1-40.   Typical Prony brake.  

# Friction & Brake Mean Effective Pressures  

The indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), discussed  previously, is the average pressure produced in the combustion  chamber during the operating cycle and is an expression of the  theoretical, frictionless power known as indicated horsepower.  In addition to completely disregarding power lost to friction,  indicated horsepower gives no indication of how much actual  power is delivered to the propeller shaft for doing useful  work. However, it is related to actual pressures that occur in  the cylinder and can be used as a measure of these pressures.  

To compute the friction loss and net power output, the  indicated horsepower of a cylinder may be thought of as  two separate powers, each producing a different effect. The  first power overcomes internal friction, and the horsepower  thus consumed is known as friction horsepower. The  second power, known as brake horsepower, produces useful  work at the propeller. That portion of IMEP that produces  brake horsepower is called brake mean effective pressure  (BMEP). The remaining pressure used to overcome internal  friction is called friction mean effective pressure (FMEP).  [Figure 1-41]  IMEP is a useful expression of total cylinder  power output, but is not a real physical quantity; likewise,  FMEP and BMEP are theoretical but useful expressions of  friction losses and net power output.  

Although BMEP and FMEP have no real existence in the  cylinder, they provide a convenient means of representing  pressure limits or rating engine performance throughout its  entire operating range. There is an operating relationship  between IMEP, BMEP, and FMEP.  

One of the basic limitations placed on engine operation is  the pressure developed in the cylinder during combustion.  In the discussion of compression ratios and indicated mean  effective pressure, it was found that, within limits, increased  pressure resulted in increased power. It was also noted that if  the cylinder pressure were not controlled within close limits,  it would impose dangerous internal loads that might result in  engine failure. Therefore, it is important to have a means of  determining these cylinder pressures as a protective measure  and for efficient application of power.  

If the bhp is known, the BMEP can be computed by means  of the following equation:  

![](images/92e42da8fadd10b840b0c40e0a1dfb3065f83ae78845170eb775e3dfe84d3b47.jpg)  

# Thrust Horsepower  

Thrust horsepower can be considered the result of the engine  and the propeller working together. If a propeller could be  designed to be 100 percent efficient, the thrust and the bph  would be the same. However, the efficiency of the propeller  varies with the engine speed, attitude, altitude, temperature,  and airspeed. Thus, the ratio of the thrust horsepower and the  bhp delivered to the propeller shaft will never be equal. For  example, if an engine develops 1,000 bhp, and it is used with a  propeller having 85 percent efficiency, the thrust horsepower  of that engine-propeller combination is 85 percent of 1,000  or 850 thrust hp. Of the four types of horsepower discussed,  it is the thrust horsepower that determines the performance  of the engine-propeller combination.  

# Efficiencies  

# Thermal Efficiency  

Any study of engines and power involves consideration of  heat as the source of power. The heat produced by the burning  of gasoline in the cylinders causes a rapid expansion of the  gases in the cylinder, and this, in turn, moves the pistons  

![](images/36e0c65ef3b77626f3d5c71774e54c69b594b7fe27e48d7ecc911c8f0f0632c2.jpg)

and creates mechanical energy. It has long been known that  mechanical work can be converted into heat and that a given  amount of heat contains the energy equivalent of a certain  amount of mechanical work. Heat and work are theoretically  interchangeable and bear a fixed relation to each other. Heat  can therefore be measured in work units (for example, ft-lb)  as well as in heat units. The British thermal unit (BTU) of  heat is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature  of 1 pound of water by  $1\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   It is equivalent to 778 ft-lb of  mechanical work. A pound of petroleum fuel, when burned  with enough air to consume it completely, gives up about  20,000 BTU, the equivalent of 15,560,000 ft-lb of mechanical  work. These quantities express the heat energy of the fuel in  heat and work units, respectively.  

The ratio of useful work done by an engine to the heat  energy of the fuel it uses, expressed in work or heat units,  is called the thermal efficiency of the engine. If two similar  engines use equal amounts of fuel, the engine that converts  into work the greater part of the energy in the fuel (higher  thermal efficiency) delivers the greater amount of power.  Furthermore, the engine that has the higher thermal efficiency  has less waste heat to dispose of to the valves, cylinders,  pistons, and cooling system of the engine. A high thermal  efficiency also means low specific fuel consumption and,  therefore, less fuel for a flight of a given distance at a given  power. Thus, the practical importance of a high thermal  efficiency is threefold, and it constitutes one of the most  desirable features in the performance of an aircraft engine.  

Of the total heat produced, 25 to 30 percent is utilized  for power output, 15 to 20 percent is lost in cooling (heat  radiated from cylinder head fins), 5 to 10 percent is lost in  overcoming friction of moving parts; and 40 to 45 percent  is lost through the exhaust. Anything that increases the heat  content going into mechanical work on the piston, which  reduces the friction and pumping losses, or which reduces  the quantity of unburned fuel or the heat lost to the engine  parts, increases the thermal efficiency.  

The portion of the total heat of combustion that is turned  into mechanical work depends to a great extent upon the  compression ratio. The compression ratio is the ratio of  the piston displacement plus combustion chamber space to  the combustion chamber space, as mentioned earlier. Other  things being equal, the higher the compression ratio is, the  larger is the proportion of the heat energy of combustion  turned into useful work at the crankshaft. On the other hand,  increasing the compression ratio increases the cylinder head  temperature. This is a limiting factor because the extremely  high temperature created by high compression ratios causes  the material in the cylinder to deteriorate rapidly and the fuel  to detonate instead of burning at a controlled rate.  

The thermal efficiency of an engine may be based on either  bhp or indicated horsepower (ihp) and is represented by the  following formula:  

![](images/b9f65ceac23eec6c16e4d47563b0f6935156c30231120921063d7dd43cb0c7c4.jpg)  

The formula for brake thermal efficiency is the same as  shown above, except the value for bhp is inserted instead of  the value for ihp.  

# Example  

An engine delivers 85 bhp for a period of 1 hour and during  that time consumes 50 pounds of fuel. Assuming the fuel has  a heat content of 18,800 BTU per pound, find the thermal  efficiency of the engine:  

![](images/05bb88cda8a4783ca8d1fda397d34507541772ff18d6e4a8425fe11443a0d586.jpg)  

Reciprocating engines are only about 34 percent thermally  efficient; that is, they transform only about 34 percent of  the total heat potential of the burning fuel into mechanical  energy. The remainder of the heat is lost through the exhaust  gases, the cooling system, and the friction within the engine.  Thermal distribution in a reciprocating engine is illustrated  in  Figure 1-42 .  

# Mechanical Efficiency  

Mechanical efficiency is the ratio that shows how much of  the power developed by the expanding gases in the cylinder  is actually delivered to the output shaft. It is a comparison  between the bhp and the ihp. It can be expressed by the  following formula:  

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{Mechanical~effectbigcap{}=\frac{\mathrm{bhp}}{\mathrm{ihp}}}}
$$  

Brake horsepower is the useful power delivered to the  propeller shaft. Indicated horsepower is the total hp  developed in the cylinders. The difference between the two  is friction horsepower (fhp), the power lost in overcoming  friction. The factor that has the greatest effect on mechanical  efficiency is the friction within the engine itself. The friction  between moving parts in an engine remains practically  constant throughout an engine’s speed range. Therefore, the  mechanical efficiency of an engine is highest when the engine  is running at the rpm at which maximum bhp is developed.  Mechanical efficiency of the average aircraft reciprocating  engine approaches 90 percent.  

# Volumetric Efficiency  

Volumetric efficiency is a ratio expressed in terms of  percentages. It is a comparison of the volume of air-fuel  charge (corrected for temperature and pressure) inducted  into the cylinders to the total piston displacement of the  engine. Various factors cause departure from a 100 percent  volumetric efficiency. The pistons of a naturally aspirated  engine displace the same volume each time they travel from  top center to bottom center of the cylinders. The amount of  charge that fills this volume on the intake stroke depends  on the existing pressure and temperature of the surrounding  atmosphere. Therefore, to find the volumetric efficiency of an  engine, standards for atmospheric pressure and temperature  had to be established. The U.S. standard atmosphere was  established in 1958, and provides the necessary pressure  and temperature values to calculate volumetric efficiency.  

The standard sea level temperature is  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , or  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$  . At this  temperature, the pressure of one atmosphere is   $14.69\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{in}^{2}$  ,  and this pressure supports a column of mercury   $\mathrm{(Hg)\,29.92}$  inches high, or  $29.92\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  . These standard sea level conditions  determine a standard density, and if the engine draws in a  volume of charge of this density exactly equal to its piston  displacement, it is said to be operating at 100 percent  volumetric efficiency. An engine drawing in less volume than  this has a volumetric efficiency lower than 100 percent. An  engine equipped with true supercharging (boost above 30.00   $"\mathrm{Hg})$   may have a volumetric efficiency greater than 100  percent. The equation for volumetric efficiency is as follows:

Many factors decrease volumetric efficiency, including:  

•	 Part-throttle operation; •	 Long intake pipes of small diameter; •	 Sharp bends in the induction system;

# Propulsive Efficiency  

A propeller is used with an engine to provide thrust. The  engine supplies bhp through a rotating shaft, and the  propeller absorbs the bhp and converts it into thrust hp. In this  conversion, some power is wasted. Since the efficiency of any  machine is the ratio of useful power output to the power input,  propulsive efficiency (in this case, propeller efficiency) is the  ratio of thrust hp to bhp. On the average, thrust hp constitutes  approximately 80 percent of the bhp. The other 20 percent  is lost in friction and slippage. Controlling the blade angle  of the propeller is the best method of obtaining maximum  propulsive efficiency for all conditions encountered in flight.  

During takeoff, when the aircraft is moving at low speeds  and when maximum power and thrust are required, a low  propeller blade angle gives maximum thrust. For high- speed flying or diving, the blade angle is increased to obtain  maximum thrust and efficiency. The constant-speed propeller  is used to give required thrust at maximum efficiency for all  flight conditions.  

# Gas Turbine Engines  

# Types & Construction  

In a reciprocating engine, the functions of intake, compression,  combustion, and exhaust all take place in the same combustion  chamber. Consequently, each must have exclusive occupancy  of the chamber during its respective part of the combustion  cycle. A significant feature of the gas turbine engine is  that separate sections are devoted to each function, and all  functions are performed simultaneously without interruption.  

A typical gas turbine engine consists of:  

1.	 An air inlet, 2.	 Compressor section, 3.	 Combustion section, 4.	 Turbine section, 5.	 Exhaust section, 6.	 Accessory section, and 7. 	 The systems necessary for starting, lubrication, fuel  supply, and auxiliary purposes, such as anti-icing,  cooling, and pressurization.  

The major components of all gas turbine engines are basically  the same; however, the nomenclature of the component  parts of various engines currently in use varies slightly due  to the difference in each manufacturer’s terminology. These  differences are reflected in the applicable maintenance  manuals. One of the greatest single factors influencing the  construction features of any gas turbine engine is the type of  compressor or compressors for which the engine is designed.  

Four types of gas turbine engines are used to propel and  power aircraft. They are the turbofan, turboprop, turboshaft,  and turbojet. The term “turbojet” was used to describe any  gas turbine engine used in aircraft. As gas turbine technology  evolved, these other engine types were developed to take  the place of the pure turbojet engine. The turbojet engine  has problems with noise and fuel consumption in the speed  range that airliners fly (.8 Mach). Due to these problems,  use of pure turbojet engines is very limited. So, almost all  airliner-type aircraft use a turbofan engine. It was developed  to turn a large fan or set of fans at the front of the engine and  produces about 80 percent of the thrust from the engine. This  engine was quieter and had better fuel consumption in this  speed range. Turbofan engines have more than one shaft in the  engine; many are two-shaft engines. This means that there are  two sets of compressors and turbines that drive them. These  two-shafted engines use two spools (a spool is a compressor  and a shaft and turbines that drive that compressor). In a  two-spool engine, there is a high-pressure spool and a low- pressure spool. The low-pressure spool generally contains  the fan(s) and the turbine stages it takes to drive them. The  high-pressure spool is the high-pressure compressor, shaft,  and turbines. This spool makes up the core of the engine, and  this is where the combustion section is located.  

Turbofan engines can be low bypass or high bypass. The  amount of air that is bypassed around the core of the engine  determines the bypass ratio. As can be seen in  Figure 1-43 ,  the air generally driven by the fan does not pass through the  internal working core of the engine. The amount of air flow  in lb/sec from the fan bypass to the core flow of the engine  is the bypass ratio.  

![](images/cb182c4305cf888130f30ab27f49a42100748a28d0c6a9bf65bb4f97a1b57e2b.jpg)  

Some low-bypass turbofan engines are used in speed  ranges above .8 Mach (military aircraft). These engines use  augmenters or afterburners to increase thrust. By adding  more fuel nozzles and a flame holder in the exhaust system  extra fuel can be sprayed and burned which can give large  increases in thrust for short amounts of time.  

The turboprop engine is a gas turbine engine that turns a  propeller through a speed reduction gear box. This type of  engine is most efficient in the 300 to 400 mph speed range and  can use shorter runways that other aircraft. Approximately  80 to 85 percent of the energy developed by the gas turbine  engine is used to drive the propeller. The rest of the available  energy exits the exhaust as thrust. By adding the horsepower  developed by the engine shaft and the horsepower in the  exiting thrust, the answer is equivalent shaft horsepower.  

With regard to aircraft, the turboshaft engine is a gas turbine  engine made to transfer horsepower to a shaft that turns a  helicopter transmission or is an onboard auxiliary power  unit (APU). An APU is used on turbine-powered aircraft to  provide electrical power and bleed air on the ground and a  backup generator in flight. Turboshaft engines can come in  many different styles, shapes, and horsepower ranges.  

# Air Entrance  

The air entrance is designed to conduct incoming air to the  compressor with a minimum energy loss resulting from drag  or ram pressure loss; that is, the flow of air into the compressor  should be free of turbulence to achieve maximum operating  efficiency. Proper inlet design contributes materially to  aircraft performance by increasing the ratio of compressor  discharge pressure to duct inlet pressure.  

This is also referred to as the compressor pressure ratio. This  ratio is the outlet pressure divided by the inlet pressure. The  amount of air passing through the engine is dependent upon  three factors:  

1.	 The compressor speed (rpm). 2.	 The forward speed of the aircraft. 3.	 The density of the ambient (surrounding) air.  

Turbine inlet type is dictated by the type of gas turbine engine.  A high-bypass turbofan engine inlet is completely different  from a turboprop or turboshaft inlet. Large gas turbine- powered aircraft almost always have a turbofan engine. The  inlet on this type of engine is bolted to the front (A flange)  of the engine. These engines are mounted on the wings, or  nacelles, on the aft fuselage, and a few are in the vertical fin.  A typical turbofan inlet can be seen in  Figure 1-44 . Since on  most modern turbofan engines the huge fan is the first part of  the aircraft the incoming air comes into contact with, icing  protection must be provided. This prevents chunks of ice  from forming on the leading edge of the inlet, breaking loose,  and damaging the fan. Warm air is bled from the engine’s  compressor and is ducted through the inlet to prevent ice  from forming. If inlet guide vanes are used to straighten the  air flow, then they also have anti-icing air flowing through  them. The inlet also contains some sound-reducing materials  that absorb the fan noise and make the engine quieter.  

Turboprops and turboshafts can use an inlet screen to help  filter out ice or debris from entering the engine. A deflector  vane and a heated inlet lip are used to prevent ice from  forming and allowing large chunks to enter the engine.  

On military aircraft, the divided entrance permits the use of very  short ducts with a resultant small pressure drop through skin  friction. Military aircraft can fly at speeds above Mach 1, but  the airflow through the engine must always stay below Mach  1. Supersonic air flow in the engine would destroy the engine.  By using convergent and divergent shaped ducts, the air flow is  controlled and dropped to subsonic speeds before entering the  engine. Supersonic inlets are used to slow the incoming engine  air to less than Mach 1 before it enters the engine.

Figure 1-43.   Turbofan engine with separate nozzles, fan, and core.  

# Accessory Section  

The accessory section of the gas turbine engine has various  functions. The primary function is to provide space for  the mounting of accessories necessary for operation and  control of the engine. Generally, it also includes accessories  concerned with the aircraft, such as electric generators and  hydraulic pumps. Secondary functions include acting as an  oil reservoir and/or oil sump and housing the accessory drive  gears and reduction gears.  

The arrangement and driving of accessories has always been  a major problem on gas turbine engines. Driven accessories  on turbofans are usually mounted on the accessory gear box,  which is on the bottom of the engine. The location of the  accessory gear box varies somewhat, but most turboprops  and turboshafts have the accessory cases mounted to the  back section of the engine.  

The components of the accessory section of all gas turbine  engines have essentially the same purpose, even though  they often differ quite extensively in construction details  and nomenclature.  

The basic elements of the accessory section are:  

1.	 The accessory case, which has machined mounting  pads for the engine-driven accessories, and  2.	 The gear train, which is housed within the accessory  case.  

The accessory case may be designed to act as an oil reservoir. If  an oil tank is utilized, a sump is usually provided below the front  bearing support for the drainage and scavenging of oil used to  lubricate bearings and drive gears. The accessory case is also  provided with adequate tubing or cored passages for spraying  lubricating oil on the gear train and supporting bearings.  

The gear train is driven by the engine high-pressure  compressor through an accessory drive shaft (tower shaft)  gear coupling, which splines with a gear box gear and the  high-pressure compressor. The reduction gearing within the  case provides suitable drive speeds for each engine accessory  or component. Because the rotor operating rpm is so high,  the accessory reduction gear ratios are relatively high. The  accessory drives are supported by ball bearings assembled in  the mounting pad bores of the accessory case.  [Figure 1-45]  

# Compressor Section  

The compressor section of the gas turbine engine has many  functions. Its primary function is to supply air in sufficient  quantity to satisfy the requirements of the combustion  burners. Specifically, to fulfill its purpose, the compressor  must increase the pressure of the mass of air received from  the air inlet duct, and then discharge it to the burners in the  quantity and at the pressures required.  

A secondary function of the compressor is to supply bleed- air for various purposes in the engine and aircraft. The  bleed-air is taken from any of the various pressure stages of  the compressor. The exact location of the bleed ports is, of  course, dependent on the pressure or temperature required  for a particular job. The ports are small openings in the  compressor case adjacent to the particular stage from which  the air is to be bled; thus, varying degrees of pressure are  available simply by tapping into the appropriate stage. Air is  often bled from the final or highest pressure stage since, at  this point, pressure and air temperature are at a maximum.  At times it may be necessary to cool this high-pressure air. If  it is used for cabin pressurization or other purposes to which  excess heat would be uncomfortable or detrimental, the air is  sent through an air conditioning unit before it enters the cabin.  

Bleed air is utilized in a wide variety of ways. Some of the  current applications of bleed air are:  

1.	 Cabin pressurization, heating, and cooling; 2.	 Deicing and anti-icing equipment; 3.	 Pneumatic starting of engines; and 4.	 Auxiliary drive units (ADU).  

Another function of the compressor bleed air is for the  operation of vortex dissipaters. The vortex dissipater supplies  a high-velocity stream of compressor bleed air blown from a  nozzle into an area where vortices are likely to form. Vortex  dissipaters destroy the vortices that would otherwise suck  debris from the ground into engines mounted in pods that  are low to the ground.  

# Compressor Types  

The two principal types of compressors currently being  used in gas turbine aircraft engines are centrifugal flow and  axial flow. The centrifugal-flow compressor achieves its  purpose by picking up the entering air and accelerating it  outwardly by centrifugal action. The axial-flow compressor  compresses air while the air continues in its original direction  of flow, thus avoiding the energy loss caused by turns. The  components of each of these two types of compressor have  their individual functions in the compression of air for the  combustion section. A stage in a compressor is considered  to be a rise in pressure.  

# Centrifugal-Flow Compressors  

The centrifugal-flow compressor consists of an impeller 

 (rotor), a diffuser (stator), and a compressor manifold. 

 [Figure 1-46]  Centrifugal compressors have a high pressure  rise per stage that can be around 8:1. Generally centrifugal  

![](images/dfc56be30975f996da19f042427c69a166fa04f4280d2b196c4cc9b2290de2c1.jpg)  
Figure 1-44.   Typical turbofan inlet.  

compressors are limited to two stages due to efficiency  concerns. The two main functional elements are the impeller  and the diffuser. Although the diffuser is a separate unit and is  placed inside and bolted to the manifold, the entire assembly  (diffuser and manifold) is often referred to as the diffuser.  For clarification during compressor familiarization, the units  are treated individually. The impeller is usually made from  forged aluminum alloy, heat treated, machined, and smoothed  for minimum flow restriction and turbulence.  

In most types, the impeller is fabricated from a single  forging. This type impeller is shown in  Figure 1-46 . The  impeller, whose function is to pick up and accelerate the air  outwardly to the diffuser, may be either of two types—single  entry or double entry. The principal differences between the  two types of impellers are size and ducting arrangement.  The double-entry type has a smaller diameter but is usually  operated at a higher rotational speed to assure sufficient  airflow. The single-entry impeller, shown in  Figure 1-47 ,  permits convenient ducting directly to the impeller eye  (inducer vanes) as opposed to the more complicated ducting  necessary to reach the rear side of the double-entry type.  Although slightly more efficient in receiving air, the single- entry impeller must be large in diameter to deliver the same  quantity of air as the double-entry type. This, of course,  increases the overall diameter of the engine.  

Included in the ducting for double-entry compressor engines  is the plenum chamber. This chamber is necessary for a  double-entry compressor because the air must enter the  engine at almost right angles to the engine axis. Therefore,  in order to give a positive flow, the air must surround the  engine compressor at a positive pressure before entering  the compressor. Included in some installations as necessary  parts of the plenum chamber are the auxiliary air-intake doors  (blow-in doors). These blow-in doors admit air to the engine  compartment during ground operation, when air requirements  for the engine are in excess of the airflow through the inlet  ducts. The doors are held closed by spring action when the  engine is not operating. During operation, however, the doors  open automatically whenever engine compartment pressure  drops below atmospheric pressure. During takeoff and flight,  ram air pressure in the engine compartment aids the springs  in holding the doors closed.  

The diffuser is an annular chamber provided with a number  of vanes forming a series of divergent passages into the  manifold. The diffuser vanes direct the flow of air from the  impeller to the manifold at an angle designed to retain the  maximum amount of energy imparted by the impeller. They  also deliver the air to the manifold at a velocity and pressure  satisfactory for use in the combustion chambers. Refer to  Figure 1-46A  and note the arrow indicating the path of airflow  through the diffuser, then through the manifold.  

The compressor manifold shown in  Figure 1-46A  diverts  the flow of air from the diffuser, which is an integral part of  the manifold, into the combustion chambers. The manifold  has one outlet port for each chamber so that the air is evenly  divided. A compressor outlet elbow is bolted to each of the  outlet ports. These air outlets are constructed in the form  of ducts and are known by a variety of names, such as air  outlet ducts, outlet elbows, or combustion chamber inlet  ducts. Regardless of the terminology used, these outlet ducts  perform a very important part of the diffusion process; that  is, they change the radial direction of the airflow to an axial  direction, in which the diffusion process is completed after the  turn. To help the elbows perform this function in an efficient  manner, turning vanes (cascade vanes) are sometimes fitted  inside the elbows. These vanes reduce air pressure losses by

# Axial-Flow Compressor  

The axial flow compressor is a combination of an engine  compressor and high-pressure turbine that drives it using a  connecting drive shaft. In a single-spool engine, the high- pressure turbine drives the entire compressor. In a dual-spool  engine, the compressor and high-pressure turbine are both  split into two segments. Each compressor segment is driven  by its corresponding turbine using two separate drive shafts,  with one inside the other. The first stage turbine drives the  N2 compressor.  

The axial-flow compressor has two main elements: a  rotor and a stator. The rotor has blades fixed on a spindle.  These blades impel air rearward in the same manner as a  propeller because of their angle and airfoil contour. The  rotor, turning at high speed, takes in air at the compressor  inlet and impels it through a series of stages. From inlet to  exit, the air flows along an axial path and is compressed at  a ratio of approximately 1.25:1 per stage. The action of the  rotor increases the compression of the air at each stage and  accelerates it rearward through several stages. With this  increased velocity, energy is transferred from the compressor  to the air in the form of velocity energy. The stator blades act  as diffusers at each stage, partially converting high velocity  to pressure. Each consecutive pair of rotor and stator blades  constitutes a pressure stage. The number of rows of blades  (stages) is determined by the amount of air and total pressure  rise required. Compressor pressure ratio increases with the  number of compression stages. Most engines utilize up to  16 stages and more.  

The stator has rows of vanes, which are in turn attached inside  an enclosing case. The stator vanes, which are stationary,  project radially toward the rotor axis and fit closely on  either side of each stage of the rotor blades. In some cases,  the compressor case, into which the stator vanes are fitted,  is horizontally divided into halves. Either the upper or lower  half may be removed for inspection or maintenance of rotor  and stator blades.  

The function of the stator vanes is to receive air from the  air inlet duct or from each preceding stage and increase  the pressure of the air and deliver it to the next stage at the  correct velocity and pressure. They also control the direction  of air to each rotor stage to obtain the maximum possible  compressor blade efficiency. Shown in  Figure 1-48  are the  rotor and stator elements of a typical axial-flow compressor.  The first stage rotor blades can be preceded by an inlet guide  vane assembly that can be fixed or variable.  

The guide vanes direct the airflow into the first stage rotor  blades at the proper angle and impart a swirling motion to  the air entering the compressor. This preswirl, in the direction  of engine rotation, improves the aerodynamic characteristics  of the compressor by reducing drag on the first stage rotor  blades. The inlet guide vanes are curved steel vanes usually  welded to steel inner and outer shrouds.  

At the discharge end of the compressor, the stator vanes are  constructed to straighten the airflow to eliminate turbulence.  These vanes are called straightening vanes or the outlet vane  assembly. The casings of axial-flow compressors not only  support the stator vanes and provide the outer wall of the  axial path the air follows, but they also provide the means  for extracting compressor air for various purposes. The stator  vanes are usually made of steel with corrosion- and erosion- resistant qualities. Quite frequently, they are shrouded  (enclosed) by a band of suitable material to simplify the  fastening problem. The vanes are welded into the shrouds,  and the outer shroud is secured to the compressor housing  inner wall by radial retaining screws.  

The rotor blades are usually made of stainless steel with  the latter stages being made of titanium. The design of  blade attachment to the rotor disc rims varies, but they are  commonly fitted into discs by either bulb-type or fir-tree  methods.  [Figure 1-49]  The blades are then locked into place  by differing methods. Compressor blade tips are reduced  

![](images/9e0453d4ddc63bece12025571f360183a1b41de9b373e949dfccaf2f706ae28d.jpg)  
Figure 1-48.   Rotor and stator elements of a typical axial-flow  compressor.  

in thickness by cutouts, referred to as blade profiles. These  profiles prevent serious damage to the blade or housing  should the blades contact the compressor housing. This  condition can occur if rotor blades become excessively loose  or if rotor support is reduced by a malfunctioning bearing.  Even though blade profiles greatly reduce such possibilities,  occasionally a blade may break under stress of rubbing and  cause considerable damage to compressor blades and stator  vane assemblies. The blades vary in length from entry to  discharge because the annular working space (drum to casing)  is reduced progressively toward the rear by the decrease in  the casing diameter.  [Figure 1-50]  This feature provides for a  fairly constant velocity through the compressor, which helps  to keep the flow of air constant.  

The rotor features either drum-type or disc-type construction.  The drum-type rotor consists of rings that are flanged to fit  one against the other, wherein the entire assembly can then  be held together by through bolts. This type of construction  is satisfactory for low-speed compressors where centrifugal  stresses are low. The disc-type rotor consists of a series of  discs machined from aluminum forgings, shrunk over a steel  shaft, with rotor blades dovetailed into the disc rims. Another  method of rotor construction is to machine the discs and  shaft from a single aluminum forging, and then to bolt steel  stub shafts on the front and rear of the assembly to provide  bearing support surfaces and splines for joining the turbine  shaft. The drum-type and disc-type rotors are illustrated in  Figures 1-50  and  1-51 , respectively.  

The combination of the compressor stages and turbine stages  on a common shaft is an engine referred to as an engine  spool. The common shaft is provided by joining the turbine  and compressor shafts by a suitable method. The engine’s  spool is supported by bearings, which are seated in suitable  bearing housings.  

As mentioned earlier, there are two configurations of the  axial compressor currently in use: the single rotor/spool and  the dual rotor/spool, sometimes referred to as solid spool and  split spool (two spool, dual spool).  

One version of the solid-spool (one spool) compressor uses  variable inlet guide vanes. Also, the first few rows of stator  vanes are variable. The main difference between variable inlet  guide vane (VIGV) and a variable stator vane (VSV) is their  position with regard to the rotor blades. VIGV are in front of  the rotor blades, and VSV are behind the rotor blades. The  angles of the inlet guide vanes and the first several stages of  the stator vanes are can be variable. During operation, air enters  the front of the engine and is directed into the compressor at  the proper angle by the variable inlet guide and directed by the  VSV. The air is compressed and forced into the combustion

section. A fuel nozzle that extends into each combustion  liner atomizes the fuel for combustion. These variables are  controlled in direct relation to the amount of power the engine  is required to produce by the power lever position.  

Most turbofan engines are of the split-spool compressor type.  Most large turbofan engines use a large fan with a few stages  of compression called the low-pressure spool. These turbofans  incorporate two compressors with their respective turbines and  interconnecting shafts, which form two physically independent  

![](images/69f7007a5482b041f90caec730a0e7619e2f140355774e16e22511b313fbe98a.jpg)

rotor systems. Many dual rotor systems have rotors turning  in opposite directions and with no mechanical connection to  each other. The second spool, referred to as the high-pressure  spool and is the compressor for the gas generator and core of  the engine, supplies air to the combustion section of the engine.  

The advantages and disadvantages of both types of  compressors are included in the following list. Even though  each type has advantages and disadvantages, each has its use  by type and size of engine.  

The centrifugal-flow compressor’s advantages are:  

•	 High pressure rise per stage, •	 Efficiency over wide rotational speed range, •	 Simplicity of manufacture and low cost,  

![](images/73ed657edc2dc4d3af9caccb03d688e33fa1f5460133f1b514046fcc514bc7f8.jpg)  
Figure 1-51.   Disc-type compressor rotor.  

•	 Low weight, and •	 Low starting power requirements.  

The centrifugal-flow compressor’s disadvantages are:  

•	 Its large frontal area for a given airflow and •	 Losses in turns between stages.  

The axial-flow compressor’s advantages are:  

•	 High peak efficiencies; •	 Small frontal area for given airflow; •	 Straight-through flow, allowing high ram efficiency;  and •	 Increased pressure rise by increasing number of stages,  with negligible losses.  

The axial-flow compressor’s disadvantages are:  

•	 Good efficiencies over only narrow rotational speed  range, •	 Difficulty of manufacture and high cost, •	 Relatively high weight, and •	 High starting power requirements (partially overcome  by split compressors).  

# Diffuser  

The diffuser is the divergent section of the engine after the  compressor and before the combustion section. It has the  all-important function of reducing high-velocity compressor  discharge air to increased pressure at a slower velocity. This  prepares the air for entry into the flame burning area of the  combustion section at a lower velocity so that the flame of  combustion can burn continuously. If the air passed through  the flame area at a high velocity, it could extinguish the flame.  

# Combustion Section  

The combustion section houses the combustion process,  which raises the temperature of the air passing through the  engine. This process releases energy contained in the air- fuel mixture. The major part of this energy is required at the  turbine or turbine stages to drive the compressor. About  $\%$   of  the energy is used to drive the gas generator compressor. The  remaining energy passes through the remaining turbine stages  that absorb more of the energy to drive the fan, output shaft,  or propeller. Only the pure turbojet allows the air to create  all the thrust or propulsion by exiting the rear of the engine  in the form of a high-velocity jet. These other engine types  have some jet velocity out the rear of the engine but most  of the thrust or power is generated by the additional turbine  stages driving a large fan, propeller, or helicopter rotor blades.  

The primary function of the combustion section is, of course,  to burn the air-fuel mixture, thereby adding heat energy to  the air. To do this efficiently, the combustion chamber must:  

•	 Provide the means for proper mixing of the fuel and  air to assure good combustion, •	 Burn this mixture efficiently, •	 Cool the hot combustion products to a temperature  that the turbine inlet guide vanes/blades can withstand  under operating conditions, and •	 Deliver the hot gases to the turbine section.  

The location of the combustion section is directly between  the compressor and the turbine sections. The combustion  chambers are always arranged coaxially with the compressor  and turbine regardless of type, since the chambers must be in a  through-flow position to function efficiently. All combustion  chambers contain the same basic elements:  

1.	 Casing. 2.	 Perforated inner liner. 3.	 Fuel injection system. 4.	 Some means for initial ignition. 5. 	 Fuel drainage system to drain off unburned fuel after  engine shutdown.  

There are currently four basic types of combustion chambers,  variations within type being in detail only. These types are:  

1.	 Can-type. 2.	 Can-annular type. 3.	 Annular type. 4.	 Reverse-flow type.  

The can-type combustion chamber is typical of the type  used on turboshaft and APUs.  [Figure 1-52]  Each of the  can-type combustion chambers consists of an outer case or  housing, within which there is a perforated stainless steel  (highly heat resistant) combustion chamber liner or inner  liner.  [Figure 1-53]  The outer case is removed to facilitate  liner replacement.  

Older engines with several combustion cans had each can  with interconnector (flame propagation) tube, which was a  necessary part of the can-type combustion chambers. Since  each can is a separate burner operating independently of the  other cans, there must be some way to spread combustion  during the initial starting operation. This is accomplished  by interconnecting all the chambers. As the flame is started  by the spark igniter plugs in two of the lower chambers, it  passes through the tubes and ignites the combustible mixture  in the adjacent chamber and continues until all the chambers

The flame tubes vary in construction details from one  engine to another, although the basic components are almost  identical.  [Figure 1-54]  The spark igniters previously  mentioned are normally two in number and are located in  two of the can-type combustion chambers.  

Another very important requirement in the construction of  combustion chambers is providing the means for draining  unburned fuel. This drainage prevents gum deposits in the fuel  manifold, nozzles, and combustion chambers. These deposits  are caused by the residue left when the fuel evaporates.  Probably most important is the danger of afterfire if the fuel  is allowed to accumulate after shutdown. If the fuel is not  drained, a great possibility exists that, at the next starting  attempt, the excess fuel in the combustion chamber will ignite  and exhaust gas temperature will exceed safe operating limits.  

The liners of the can-type combustors have perforations  of various sizes and shapes, each hole having a specific  purpose and effect on flame propagation within the liner.  [Figure 1-52]  The air entering the combustion chamber  is divided by the proper holes, louvers, and slots into two  main streams—primary and secondary air. The primary or  combustion air is directed inside the liner at the front end,  where it mixes with the fuel and is burned. Secondary or  cooling air passes between the outer casing and the liner and  joins the combustion gases through larger holes toward the  rear of the liner, cooling the combustion gases from about   $3{,}500\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to near   $1{,}500\;^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . To aid in atomization of the fuel,  holes are provided around the fuel nozzle in the dome or  inlet end of the can-type combustor liner. Louvers are also  provided along the axial length of the liners to direct a cooling  layer of air along the inside wall of the liner. This layer of air  also tends to control the flame pattern by keeping it centered  in the liner, thereby preventing burning of the liner walls.  Figure 1-55  illustrates the annular combustion chamber liner.  

Some provision is always made in the combustion chamber  case for installation of a fuel nozzle. The fuel nozzle delivers  the fuel into the liner in a finely atomized spray. The more the  spray is atomized, the more rapid and efficient the burning  process is.  

Two types of fuel nozzle currently being used in the various  types of combustion chambers are the simplex nozzle and the  duplex nozzle. The construction features of these nozzles are  covered in greater detail in Chapter 2, Engine Fuel & Fuel  Metering Systems.  

The spark igniter plugs of the annular combustion chamber  are the same basic type used in the can-type combustion  chambers, although construction details may vary. There are  usually two igniters mounted on the boss provided on each  of the chamber housings. The igniters must be long enough  to protrude from the housing into the combustion chamber.  

The burners are interconnected by projecting flame  tubes which facilitate the engine-starting process as  mentioned previously in the can-type combustion chamber  familiarization. The flame tubes function identically to those  previously discussed, differing only in construction details.  

The can-annular combustion chamber is not used in modern  

![](images/1e0c2db6032acb5566dfc0c46ece08305001e0385068790d79d61666b0aa8bb6.jpg)  
Figure 1-54.   Interconnecting flame tubes for can-type combustion chambers.  

engines. The forward face of each chamber presents six  apertures, which align with the six fuel nozzles of the  corresponding fuel nozzle cluster.  [Figure 1-56]  These  nozzles are the dual-orifice (duplex) type requiring the use  of a flow-divider (pressurizing valve), as mentioned in the  can-type combustion chamber discussion. Around each  nozzle are preswirl vanes for imparting a swirling motion to  the fuel spray, which results in better atomization of the fuel,  better burning, and efficiency. The swirl vanes function to  provide two effects imperative to proper flame propagation:  

1.	 High flame speed—better mixing of air and fuel,  ensuring spontaneous burning. 2.	 Low air velocity axially—swirling eliminates overly  rapid flame movement axially.  

The swirl vanes greatly aid flame propagation, since a high  degree of turbulence in the early combustion and cooling  stages is desirable. The vigorous mechanical mixing of the  fuel vapor with the primary air is necessary, since mixing by  diffusion alone is too slow. This same mechanical mixing  is also established by other means, such as placing coarse  

![](images/8231e8570433de806167853c82ae468921218e856c47e63cef24e2cdec6a9562.jpg)

screens in the diffuser outlet, as is the case in most axial- flow engines.  

The can-annular combustion chambers also must have the  required fuel drain valves located in two or more of the  bottom chambers, assuring proper drainage and elimination  of residual fuel burning at the next start.  

The flow of air through the holes and louvers of the can- annular chambers, is almost identical with the flow through  other types of burners.  [Figure 1-56]  Special baffling is used  to swirl the combustion airflow and to give it turbulence.  Figure 1-57  shows the flow of combustion air, metal cooling  air, and the diluent or gas cooling air. The air flow direction

is indicated by the arrows.  

The basic components of an annular combustion chamber  are a housing and a liner, as in the can type. The liner  consists of an undivided circular shroud extending all the  way around the outside of the turbine shaft housing. The  chamber is constructed of heat-resistant materials, which  are sometimes coated with thermal barrier materials, such  as ceramic materials. The annular combustion chamber is  illustrated in  Figure 1-58 . Modern turbine engines usually  have an annular combustion chamber. As can be seen in  Figure 1-59 , the annular combustion chamber also uses  louvers and holes to prevent the flame from contacting the  side of the combustion chamber.  

A reverse-flow combustor is a type of combustor in which  the air from the compressor enters the combustor outer case  and reverses its direction as it flows into the inner liner.  It again reverses its direction before it flows through the  turbine. Reverse-flow combustors are used where engine  length is critical.  

# Turbine Section  

The turbine transforms a portion of the kinetic (velocity)  energy of the exhaust gases into mechanical energy to drive the  gas generator compressor and accessories. The sole purpose  of the gas generator turbine is to absorb approximately 60  to 70 percent of the total pressure energy from the exhaust  gases. The exact amount of energy absorption at the turbine is  determined by the load the turbine is driving (i.e., compressor  size and type, number of accessories, and the load applied by  the other turbine stages). These turbine stages can be used to  drive a low-pressure compressor (fan), propeller, and shaft.  The turbine section of a gas turbine engine is located aft, or  downstream, of the combustion chamber. Specifically, it is  directly behind the combustion chamber outlet.  

The turbine assembly consists of two basic elements: turbine  inlet guide vanes and turbine disc.  [Figures 1-60  and   $_{l-6l J}$  The stator element is known by a variety of names, of which  turbine inlet nozzle vanes, turbine inlet guide vanes, and  nozzle diaphragm are three of the most commonly used.

Figure 1-60.   Turbine inlet guide vanes.  

The turbine inlet nozzle vanes are located directly aft of the  combustion chambers and immediately forward of the turbine  wheel. This is the highest or hottest temperature that comes  in contact with metal components in the engine. The turbine  inlet temperature must be controlled, or damage will occur  to the turbine inlet vanes.  

After the combustion chamber has introduced the heat energy  into the mass airflow and delivered it evenly to the turbine  

![](images/7b08c5ce1599bcf89c9c8cf39a41895423ba41a2fdbc8ba9e7409d64d7e8a0a2.jpg)  
Figure 1-61.   Turbine disc.  

inlet nozzles, the nozzles must prepare the mass air flow to  drive the turbine rotor. The stationary vanes of the turbine  inlet nozzles are contoured and set at such an angle that they  form a number of small nozzles discharging gas at extremely  high speed; thus, the nozzle converts a varying portion of the  heat and pressure energy to velocity energy that can then be  converted to mechanical energy through the turbine blades.  

There are three types of turbine blades: the impulse turbine  blade, reaction turbine blade, and the reaction-impulse  turbine blade. The impulse turbine blade is also referred to  as a bucket. This is because as the stream of air strikes the  center of the blade it changes the direction of the energy as it  causes the blades to rotate the disc and rotor shaft. The turbine  nozzle guide vanes can usually be adjusted during engine  overhaul and assembly in order to increase the efficiency of  the air stream striking the blades or buckets of the turbine.  [Figure 1-62]  

Reaction turbine blades cause the disc to rotate by the  aerodynamic action of the airstream directed to flow past  the blade at a particular angle in order to develop the most  efficient power from the turbine engine.  [Figure 1-62]  

The reaction-impulse turbine blade combines the action of  both the impulse and reaction blades designs. The blade has  more of the bucket shape of the impulse blade at the blade root  and it also has more of an airfoil shape of the reaction blade on  the second half of the blade toward the outer end of the blade.  

The second purpose of the turbine inlet nozzle is to deflect  the gases to a specific angle in the direction of turbine wheel  rotation. Since the gas flow from the nozzle must enter the  turbine blade passageway while it is still rotating, it is essential  to aim the gas in the general direction of turbine rotation.  

The turbine inlet nozzle assembly consists of an inner  shroud and an outer shroud between which the nozzle vanes  are fixed. The number and size of inlet vanes employed  vary with different types and sizes of engines.  Figure 1-63 illustrates typical turbine inlet nozzles featuring loose and  welded vanes. The vanes of the turbine inlet nozzle may be  assembled between the outer and inner shrouds or rings in  a variety of ways. Although the actual elements may vary  slightly in configuration and construction features, there is  one characteristic peculiar to all turbine inlet nozzles: the  nozzle vanes must be constructed to allow thermal expansion.  Otherwise, there would be severe distortion or warping of  the metal components because of rapid temperature changes.  

The thermal expansion of turbine nozzles is accomplished  by one of several methods. One method necessitates loose  assembly of the supporting inner and outer vane shrouds.  [Figure 1-63A]  

Each vane fits into a contoured slot in the shrouds, which  conforms to the airfoil shape of the vane. These slots are  slightly larger than the vanes to give a loose fit. For further  support, the inner and outer shrouds are encased by inner  and outer support rings, which provide increased strength  and rigidity. These support rings also facilitate removal of  the nozzle vanes as a unit. Without the rings, the vanes could  fall out as the shrouds were removed.  

Another method of thermal expansion construction is to fit the  vanes into inner and outer shrouds; however, in this method  the vanes are welded or riveted into position.  [Figure 1-63B] Some means must be provided to allow thermal expansion;  therefore, either the inner or the outer shroud ring is cut  into segments. The saw cuts separating the segments allow  sufficient expansion to prevent stress and warping of the vanes.  

The rotor element of the turbine section consists essentially  of a shaft and a wheel.  [Figure 1-64]  The turbine wheel is  a dynamically balanced unit consisting of blades attached  to a rotating disc. The disc, in turn, is attached to the main  power-transmitting shaft of the engine. The exhaust gases  leaving the turbine inlet nozzle vanes act on the blades of  the turbine wheel, causing the assembly to rotate at a very  high rate of speed. The high rotational speed imposes severe  centrifugal loads on the turbine wheel, and at the same  time the elevated temperatures result in a lowering of the  strength of the material. Consequently, the engine speed and  temperature must be controlled to keep turbine operation  within safe limits.  

The turbine disc is referred to as such without blades. When  the turbine blades are installed, the disc then becomes the  turbine wheel. The disc acts as an anchoring component for  the turbine blades. Since the disc is bolted or welded to the  

![](images/71037b5c38f9269e7a71dca22a87611068931379c822a73fe4c0c6b149b21069.jpg)  
Figure 1-62.   Impulse and reaction turbine blades.  

shaft, the blades can transmit to the rotor shaft the energy  they extract from the exhaust gases.  

The disc rim is exposed to the hot gases passing through the  blades and absorbs considerable heat from these gases. In  addition, the rim also absorbs heat from the turbine blades  by conduction. Hence, disc rim temperatures are normally  high and well above the temperatures of the more remote  inner portion of the disc. As a result of these temperature  gradients, thermal stresses are added to the rotational stresses.  

Additionally, turbine blades are generally more susceptible to  operating damage than compressor blades due to the exposure  of high temperatures. There are various methods to relieve, at  least partially, the aforementioned stresses. One such method  is to bleed cooling air back onto the face of the disc.  

Another method of relieving the thermal stresses of the disc  is incidental to blade installation. A series of grooves or  notches, conforming to the blade root design, are broached  in the rim of the disc. These grooves allow attachment of the  

![](images/919bff3c61ce18be7c07c372b2dd4810f14f6790e0faed0ee4b57a3c0af71885.jpg)  
Figure 1-63.   Typical turbine nozzle vane assemblies.  

turbine blades to the disc; at the same time, space is provided  by the notches for thermal expansion of the disc. Sufficient  clearance exists between the blade root and the notch to  permit movement of the turbine blade when the disc is cold.  During engine operation, expansion of the disc decreases  the clearance. This causes the blade root to fit tightly in the  disc rim.  

The turbine shaft is usually fabricated from alloy steel.  [Figure 1-64]  It must be capable of absorbing the high torque  loads that are exerted on it.  

The methods of connecting the shaft to the turbine disc vary.  In one method, the shaft is welded to the disc, which has a  butt or protrusion provided for the joint. Another method is  by bolting. This method requires that the shaft have a hub  that fits a machined surface on the disc face. Then, the bolts  are inserted through holes in the shaft hub and anchored in  tapped holes in the disc. Of the two connection methods,  bolting is more common.  

The turbine shaft must have some means for attachment to  the compressor rotor hub. This is usually accomplished by  a spline cut on the forward end of the shaft. The spline fits  into a coupling device between the compressor and turbine  shafts. If a coupling is not used, the splined end of the turbine  shaft may fit into a splined recess in the compressor rotor hub.  This splined coupling arrangement is used almost exclusively  with centrifugal compressor engines, while axial compressor  engines may use either of these described methods.  

There are various ways of attaching turbine blades, some  similar to compressor blade attachment. The most satisfactory  method utilizes the fir-tree design.  [Figure 1-65]  

The blades are retained in their respective grooves by a  variety of methods, the more common of which are peening,  welding, lock tabs, and riveting.  Figure 1-66  shows a typical  turbine wheel using rivets for blade retention.  

The peening method of blade retention is used frequently  in various ways. One of the most common applications of  peening requires a small notch to be ground in the edge of  the blade fir-tree root prior to the blade installation. After  the blade is inserted into the disc, the notch is filled by the  disc metal, which is “flowed” into it by a small punch-mark  made in the disc adjacent to the notch. The tool used for this  job is similar to a center punch.  

Another method of blade retention is to construct the root  of the blade so that it contains all the elements necessary for  its retention. This method uses the blade root as a stop made  on one end of the root so that the blade can be inserted and  removed in one direction only, while on the opposite end is  a tang. This tang is bent to secure the blade in the disc.  

Turbine blades may be either forged or cast, depending on the  composition of the alloys. Most blades are precision cast and  finish ground to the desired shape. Many turbine blades are  cast as a single crystal, which gives the blades better strength  and heat properties. Heat barrier coating, such as ceramic  coating, and air flow cooling help keep the turbine blades and  inlet nozzles cooler. This allows the exhaust temperature to  be raised, increasing the efficiency of the engine.  Figure 1-67  

![](images/e0f300da3dd11f19878f06e42ccc14ee40ccc1113c27f07a8069bd1352d8de81.jpg)  
Figure 1-64.   Rotor elements of the turbine assembly.  

Most turbines are open at the outer perimeter of the blades;  however, a second type called the shrouded turbine is  sometimes used. The shrouded turbine blades, in effect, form  a band around the outer perimeter of the turbine wheel. This  improves efficiency and vibration characteristics and permits  lighter stage weights. On the other hand, it limits turbine  speed and requires more blades.  [Figure 1-68]  

In turbine rotor construction, it occasionally becomes  necessary to utilize turbines of more than one stage. A  single turbine wheel often cannot absorb enough power  from the exhaust gases to drive the components dependent  on the turbine for rotative power; thus, it is necessary to add  additional turbine stages.  

A turbine stage consists of a row of stationary vanes or  nozzles, followed by a row of rotating blades. In some  models of turboprop engine, as many as five turbine stages  have been utilized successfully. It should be remembered  that, regardless of the number of wheels necessary for  driving engine components, there is always a turbine nozzle  preceding each wheel.  

As was brought out in the preceding discussion of turbine  stages, the occasional use of more than one turbine wheel is  warranted in cases of heavy rotational loads. It should also  be pointed out that the same loads that necessitate multistage  turbines often make it advantageous to incorporate multiple  compressor rotors.  

In the single-stage rotor turbine, the power is developed by  one turbine rotor, and all engine-driven parts are driven by

this single wheel.  [Figure 1-69]  This arrangement is used  on engines where the need for low weight and compactness  predominates. This is the simplest version of the pure turbojet  engine.  

A multistage turbine is shown in  Figure 1-70 . In multiple  spool engines, each spool has its own set of turbine stages.  Each set of turbine stages turns the compressor attached to  it. Most turbofan engines have two spools: low pressure (fan  shaft a few stages of compression and the turbine to drive it)  and high pressure (high pressure compressor shaft and high  pressure turbine).  [Figure 1-71]  

The remaining element to be discussed concerning turbine  familiarization is the turbine casing or housing. The turbine  casing encloses the turbine wheel and the nozzle vane  assembly, and at the same time gives either direct or indirect  support to the stator elements of the turbine section. It always  has flanges provided front and rear for bolting the assembly  to the combustion chamber housing and the exhaust cone  assembly, respectively. A turbine casing is illustrated in  

![](images/9a4ce823eae8f90e8ffcfb71757d0e8ad403b1e199b823bbfc69531db82a469d.jpg)

# Exhaust Section  

The exhaust section of the gas turbine engine consists  of several components. Although the components have  individual purposes, they also have one common function:  they must direct the flow of hot gases rearward in such a  manner as to prevent turbulence and, at the same time, impart  a high final or exit velocity to the gases. In performing the  various functions, each of the components affects the flow  of gases in different ways. The exhaust section is located  directly behind the turbine section and ends when the gases  are ejected at the rear in the form of high-velocity exhaust  gases. The components of the exhaust section include the  exhaust cone, tailpipe (if required), and the exhaust nozzle.  The exhaust cone collects the exhaust gases discharged from  the turbine section and gradually converts them into a solid  flow of gases. In performing this, the velocity of the gases is  decreased slightly and the pressure increased. This is due to  the diverging passage between the outer duct and the inner  cone; that is, the annular area between the two units increases  rearward. The exhaust cone assembly consists of an outer  shell or duct, an inner cone, three or four radial hollow struts  or fins, and the necessary number of tie rods to aid the struts  in supporting the inner cone from the outer duct.  

The outer shell or duct is usually made of stainless steel and  is attached to the rear flange of the turbine case. This element  collects the exhaust gases and delivers them directly to the  exhaust nozzle. The duct must be constructed to include such  features as a predetermined number of thermocouple bosses  for installing exhaust temperature thermocouples, and there  must also be insertion holes for the supporting tie rods. In  some cases, tie rods are not used for supporting the inner  cone. If such is the case, the hollow struts provide the sole  support of the inner cone, the struts being spot-welded in  position to the inside surface of the duct and to the inner cone,  respectively.  [Figure 1-73]  The radial struts actually have a  twofold function. They not only support the inner cone in the  

![](images/e21253fde761a6ca77ec3a9102992b40d16ced30428f75ec74ac7643cc2d702d.jpg)

exhaust duct, but they also perform the important function of  straightening the swirling exhaust gases that would otherwise  leave the turbine at an angle of approximately   $45^{\circ}$  .  

The centrally located inner cone fits rather closely against  the rear face of the turbine disc, preventing turbulence of the  gases as they leave the turbine wheel. The cone is supported  by the radial struts. In some configurations, a small hole is  located in the exit tip of the cone. This hole allows cooling  air to be circulated from the aft end of the cone, where the  pressure of the gases is relatively high, into the interior of the  cone and consequently against the face of the turbine wheel.  The flow of air is positive, since the air pressure at the turbine  wheel is relatively low due to rotation of the wheel; thus, air  circulation is assured. The gases used for cooling the turbine  wheel return to the main path of flow by passing through the  clearance between the turbine disc and the inner cone. The  exhaust cone assembly is the terminating component of the  basic engine. The remaining component (the exhaust nozzle)  is usually considered an airframe component.  

The tailpipe is usually constructed so that it is semiflexible.  On some tailpipes, a bellows arrangement is incorporated  in its construction, allowing movement in installation,  maintenance, and in thermal expansion. This eliminates stress  and warping which would otherwise be present.  

The heat radiation from the exhaust cone and tailpipe could  damage the airframe components surrounding these units.  For this reason, some means of insulation had to be devised.  There are several suitable methods of protecting the fuselage  structure; two of the most common are insulation blankets  and shrouds.  

The insulation blanket, illustrated in  Figures 1-74  and  1-75 ,  consists of several layers of aluminum foil, each separated by  a layer of fiberglass or some other suitable material. Although  these blankets protect the fuselage from heat radiation, they  are used primarily to reduce heat loss from the exhaust system.  The reduction of heat loss improves engine performance.

Figure 1-73.   Exhaust collector with welded support struts.  

There are two types of exhaust nozzle designs: the converging  design for subsonic gas velocities and the converging- diverging design for supersonic gas velocities. These exhaust  nozzle designs are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3,  Induction & Exhaust Systems.  

The exhaust nozzle opening may be of either fixed or variable  area. The fixed-area type is the simpler of the two exhaust  nozzles since there are no moving parts. The outlet area of the  fixed exhaust nozzle is very critical to engine performance.  If the nozzle area is too large, thrust is wasted; if the area is  too small, the engine could choke or stall. A variable-area  exhaust nozzle is used when an augmenter or afterburner is  used due to the increased mass of flow when the afterburner is  activated. It must increase its open area when the afterburner  is selected. When the afterburner is off, the exhaust nozzle  closes to a smaller area of opening.  

# Gas Turbine Engine Bearings & Seals  

The main bearings have the critical function of supporting  the main engine rotor. The number of bearings necessary  for proper engine support is, for the most part, determined  by the length and weight of the engine rotor. The length and  weight are directly affected by the type of compressor used  in the engine. Naturally, a two-spool compressor requires  more bearing support. The minimum number of bearings  required to support one shaft is one deep groove ball bearing  (thrust and radial loads) and one straight roller bearing (radial  load only). Sometimes, it is necessary to use more than one  roller bearing if the shaft is subject to vibration or its length  is excessive. The gas turbine rotors are supported by ball and  roller bearings, which are antifriction bearings.  [Figure 1-76]   Many newer engines use hydraulic bearings, in which the  outside race is surrounded by a thin film of oil. This reduces  vibrations transmitted to the engine.  

![](images/fd38072d78b70250a9d163868068b3c15baff7b1cf794d094f16c4f506b1e68c.jpg)

•	 Offer little rotational resistance, •	 Facilitate precision alignment of rotating elements, •	 Are relatively inexpensive, •	 Are easily replaced, •	 Withstand high momentary overloads, •	 Are simple to cool, lubricate, and maintain, •	 Accommodate both radial and axial loads, and •	 Are relatively resistant to elevated temperatures.  

The main disadvantages are their vulnerability to foreign  matter and tendency to fail without appreciable warning.  Usually the ball bearings are positioned on the compressor or  turbine shaft so that they can absorb any axial (thrust) loads  or radial loads. Because the roller bearings present a larger  working surface, they are better equipped to support radial  loads than thrust loads. Therefore, they are used primarily  for this purpose. A typical ball or roller bearing assembly  includes a bearing support housing, which must be strongly  constructed and supported in order to carry the radial and  axial loads of the rapidly rotating rotor. The bearing housing  usually contains oil seals to prevent the oil leaking from its  normal path of flow. It also delivers the oil to the bearing for  its lubrication, usually through spray nozzles. The oil seals  may be the labyrinth or thread (helical) type. These seals  also may be pressurized to minimize oil leaking along the  compressor shaft. The labyrinth seal is usually pressurized,  but the helical seal depends solely on reverse threading to  stop oil leakage. These two types of seals are very similar,  differing only in thread size and the fact that the labyrinth  seal is pressurized.  

Another type of oil seal used on some of the later engines is  the carbon seal. These seals are usually spring loaded and  are similar in material and application to the carbon brushes  

![](images/45e82a4a3a12540b3d454eb51de12a09e67bc65ed9dff55ec0f764baa337c429.jpg)

used in electrical motors. Carbon seals rest against a surface  provided to create a sealed bearing cavity or void; thus, the  oil is prevented from leaking out along the shaft into the  compressor airflow or the turbine section.  [Figure 1-77]  

The ball or roller bearing is fitted into the bearing housing and  may have a self-aligning feature. If a bearing is self-aligning,  it is usually seated in a spherical ring. This allows the shaft  a certain amount of radial movement without transmitting  stress to the bearing inner race.  

The bearing surface is usually provided by a machined journal  on the appropriate shaft. The bearing is usually locked in  position by a steel snap ring or other suitable locking device.  The rotor shaft also provides the matching surface for the oil  seals in the bearing housing. These machined surfaces are  called lands and fit in rather close to the oil seal.  

# Turboprop Engines  

The turbopropeller (turboprop) engine is a combination of  a gas turbine engine, reduction gear box, and a propeller.  [Figure 1-78]  Turboprops are basically gas turbine engines  that have a compressor, combustion chamber(s), turbine,  and an exhaust nozzle (gas generator), all of which operate  in the same manner as any other gas engine. However, the  difference is that the turbine in the turboprop engine usually  has extra stages to extract energy to drive the propeller. In  addition to operating the compressor and accessories, the  turboprop turbine transmits increased power forward through  a shaft and a gear train to drive the propeller. The increased  power is generated by the exhaust gases passing through  additional stages of the turbine.  

Some engines use a multirotor turbine with coaxial shafts  for independent driving of the compressor and propeller.  Although there are three turbines utilized in this illustration,  as many as five turbine stages have been used for driving the  two rotor elements, propeller, and accessories.  

The exhaust gases also contribute to engine power output  through thrust production, although the amount of energy  available for thrust is considerably reduced. Two basic types  of turboprop engine are in use: fixed turbine and free turbine.  The fixed turbine has a mechanical connection from the gas  generator (gas-turbine engine) to the reduction gear box  and propeller. The free turbine has only an air link from gas  generator to the power turbines. There is no mechanical link  from the propeller to the gas turbine engine (gas generator).  There are advantages and disadvantages of each system, with  the airframe generally dictating the system used.  

Since the basic components of normal gas-turbine and  turboprop engines differ slightly only in design features, it  should be fairly simple to apply acquired knowledge of the

basic gas turbine to the turboprop.  

The typical turboprop engine can be broken down into  assemblies as follows:  

1.	 The power section assembly—contains the usual major  components of a gas turbine engine (i.e., compressor,  combustion chamber, turbine, and exhaust sections). 2.	 The reduction gear or gearbox assembly—contains  

those sections unique to turboprop configurations.  

3.	 The torquemeter assembly—transmits the torque from  the engine to the gearbox of the reduction section. 4.	 The accessory drive housing assembly—mounted  on the bottom of the compressor air inlet housing.  It includes the necessary gear trains for driving all  power section driven accessories at their proper rpm  in relation to engine rpm.  

# Turboshaft Engines  

A gas-turbine engine that delivers power through a shaft to  operate something other than a propeller is referred to as  a turboshaft engine.  [Figure 1-79]  The output shaft may  be coupled directly to the engine turbine, or the shaft may  be driven by a turbine of its own (free turbine) located in  the exhaust stream. As mentioned with the turboprop, the  free turbine rotates independently. This principle is used  extensively in current production of turboshaft engines. The  turboshaft engine’s output is measured in horsepower instead  of thrust because the power output is a turning shaft.  

# Turbofan Engines  

The turbofan gas turbine engine is, in principle, the same as  a turboprop, except that the propeller is replaced by a duct- enclosed axial-flow fan.  [Figure 1-80]  The fan can be a part  of the first-stage compressor blades or can be mounted as a  separate set of fan blades. The blades are mounted forward  of the compressor.  

The general principle of the fan engine is to convert more  of the fuel energy into pressure. With more of the energy  

![](images/4e94eecc970505b20e840ea298e2d2ceaf9e0e528b1b9258f574b2d9a7adaa1e.jpg)

Figure 1-79.   Turboshaft engine.  

converted to pressure, a greater product of pressure times  area can be achieved. One of the major advantages is turbofan  production of this additional thrust without increasing fuel  flow. The end result is fuel economy with the consequent  increase in range. Because more of the fuel energy is turned  into pressure in the turbofan engine, additional stages must  be added in the turbine section to provide the power to drive  the fan. This means there is less energy left over and less  thrust from the core exhaust gases. Also, in a mixed-exhaust  nozzle (where fan air and core air mix in a common nozzle  before entering ambient conditions) the exhaust nozzle must  be larger in area. The result is that the fan develops most of  the thrust. The thrust produced by the fan more than makes  up for the decrease in thrust of the core (gas generator) of  the engine. Depending on the fan design and bypass ratio,  it produces 80 percent of the turbofan engine’s total thrust.  

Two different exhaust nozzle designs are used with turbofan  engines. The air leaving the fan can be ducted overboard by  a separate fan nozzle  [Figure 1-43] , or it can be ducted along  the outer case of the basic engine to be discharged through  the mixed nozzle (core and fan exhaust together). The fan air  is either mixed with the exhaust gases before it is discharged  (mixed or common nozzle), or it passes directly to the  atmosphere without prior mixing (separate nozzle). Turbofans  are the most widely used gas turbine engine for air transport  aircraft. The turbofan is a compromise between the good  operating efficiency and high thrust capability of a turboprop  and the high speed, high altitude capability of a turbojet.  

# Turbine Engine Operating Principles  

The principle used by a gas turbine engine as it provides  force to move an airplane is based on Newton’s Third Law.  This law states that for every action there is an equal and  opposite reaction; therefore, if the engine accelerates a mass  of air (action), it applies a force on the aircraft (reaction).  The turbofan generates thrust by giving a relatively slower  acceleration to a large quantity of air. The old pure turbojet  engine achieves thrust by imparting greater acceleration to a  smaller quantity of air. This was its main problem with fuel  consumption and noise.  

The mass of air is accelerated within the engine by the use of  a continuous-flow cycle. Ambient air enters the inlet diffuser  where it is subjected to changes in temperature, pressure, and  velocity due to ram effect. The compressor then increases  pressure and temperature of the air mechanically. The air  continues at constant pressure to the burner section where its  temperature is increased by combustion of fuel. The energy  is taken from the hot gas by expanding through a turbine  which drives the compressor, and by expanding through an  exhaust nozzle designed to discharge the exhaust gas at high  velocity to produce thrust.  

![](images/c37b8346c0ecddbda3c9e58d58cdfb0daafc96d287962aabe26cdccb342f5796.jpg)  
Figure 1-80.   Turbofan engine.  

The high velocity gases from the engine may be considered  continuous, imparting this force against the aircraft in which  it is installed, thereby producing thrust. The formula for thrust  can be derived from Newton’s second law, which states that  force is proportional to the product of mass and acceleration.  This law is expressed in the following formula:  

$$
\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{M}\times\mathbf{A}
$$  

where:  

$\mathrm{F}=$   force in pounds  $\mathbf{M}=$   mass in pounds per second  $\mathbf{A}=$  acceleration in feet per second  

In the above formula, mass is similar to weight, but it is  actually a different quantity. Mass refers to the quantity  of matter, while weight refers to the pull of gravity on that  quantity of matter. At sea level under standard conditions,  1 pound of mass has a weight of 1 pound. To calculate the  acceleration of a given mass, the gravitational constant is  used as a unit of comparison. The force of gravity is 32.2  feet per second squared   $(\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{sec}^{2})$  ). This means that a free  falling 1 pound object accelerates at the rate of 32.2 feet per  second each second that gravity acts on it. Since the object  mass weighs 1 pound, which is also the actual force imparted  to it by gravity, it can be assumed that a force of 1 pound  accelerates a 1 pound object at the rate of   $32.2\;\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{sec}^{2}$  .  

Also, a force of 10 pound accelerates a mass of 10 pound at  the rate of   $32.2~\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{sec}^{2}$  . This is assuming there is no friction  or other resistance to overcome. It is now apparent that the  ratio of the force (in pounds) is to the mass (in pounds) as  the acceleration in   $\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{sec}^{2}$   is to 32.2. Using M to represent  the mass in pounds, the formula may be expressed thus:  

$$
\mathrm{\frac{\partialF}{\partialM}=\frac{A}{G}\,\,\,o r\,\,\,F=\frac{M A}{G}}
$$  

where: F  =  force  M  =  mass  $\mathbf{A}=$   acceleration   $\mathbf{G}=$   gravity  

In any formula involving work, the time factor must be  considered. It is convenient to have all time factors in  equivalent units (i.e., seconds, minutes, or hours). In  calculating jet thrust, the term “pounds of air per second” is  convenient, since the second is the same unit of time used  for the force of gravity.  

Using the following formula, compute the force necessary to  accelerate a mass of 50 pounds by   $100\;\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{sec}^{2}$  .  

![](images/e01453339f5652739903036a86a54da49efe75356003d52375dd97b84d1d7c33.jpg)  

This illustrates that if the velocity mass per second is  increased by 100, the resulting thrust is 155 pounds.  

Since the turbojet engine accelerates air, the following  formula can be used to determine jet thrust:  

![](images/e068ec6a42b9d6bfadf0b29957690d675e1102c6ec0d9b4ea04e80d196b98eb2.jpg)  

As an example, to use the formula for changing the velocity  of 100 pounds of mass airflow per second from 600 ft/sec to  800 ft/sec, the formula can be applied as follows:  

![](images/6ec755a9d43d66e45436feabf426d02d48d5da9caa4ca1d36b7aa3df4430b5d3.jpg)  

As shown by the formula, if the mass airflow per second and  the difference in the velocity of the air from the intake to the  exhaust are known, it is easy to compute the force necessary  to produce the change in the velocity. Therefore, the thrust of  the engine must be equal to the force required to accelerate  the air mass through the engine. Then, by using the symbol  “Fn” for thrust pounds, the formula becomes:  

![](images/b599b6273ad7f9565d86d9515c506f4ab336621b52383daae9e52b6dec32bf31.jpg)  

Thrust of a gas turbine engine can be increased by two  methods: increasing the mass flow of air through the engine  or increasing the gas velocity. If the velocity of the turbojet  engine remains constant with respect to the aircraft, the thrust  decreases if the speed of the aircraft is increased. This is  because  $\mathrm{V}_{1}$   increases in value. This does not present a serious  problem, however, because as the aircraft speed increases,  more air enters the engine, and jet velocity increases. The  resultant net thrust is almost constant with increased airspeed.  

The Brayton cycle is the name given to the thermodynamic  cycle of a gas turbine engine to produce thrust. This is a  variable volume constant-pressure cycle of events and is  commonly called the constant-pressure cycle. A more recent  term is “continuous combustion cycle.” The four continuous  and constant events are intake, compression, expansion  (includes power), and exhaust. These cycles are discussed  as they apply to a gas-turbine engine. In the intake cycle, air  enters at ambient pressure and a constant volume. It leaves  the intake at an increased pressure and a decrease in volume.  At the compressor section, air is received from the intake at  an increased pressure, slightly above ambient, and a slight  decrease in volume. Air enters the compressor where it is  compressed. It leaves the compressor with a large increase in  pressure and decrease in volume, created by the mechanical  action of the compressor. The next step, expansion, takes  place in the combustion chamber by burning fuel, which  expands the air by heating it. The pressure remains relatively  constant, but a marked increase in volume takes place. The  expanding gases move rearward through the turbine assembly  and are converted from velocity energy to mechanical energy  by the turbine. The exhaust section, which is a convergent  duct, converts the expanding volume and decreasing pressure  of the gases to a final high velocity. The force created inside  the engine to keep this cycle continuous has an equal and  opposite reaction (thrust) to move the aircraft forward.  

Bernoulli’s principle (whenever a stream of any fluid has its  velocity increased at a given point, the pressure of the stream  at that point is less than the rest of the stream) is applied to  gas turbine engines through the design of convergent and  divergent air ducts. The convergent duct increases velocity  and decreases pressure. The divergent duct decreases  velocity and increases pressure. The convergent principle is  usually used for the exhaust nozzle. The divergent principle  is used in the compressor and diffuser where the air is  slowing and pressurizing.  

# Gas Turbine Engine Performance  

Thermal efficiency is a prime factor in gas turbine performance.  It is the ratio of net work produced by the engine to the  chemical energy supplied in the form of fuel. The three most  important factors affecting the thermal efficiency are turbine  inlet temperature, compression ratio, and the component  efficiencies of the compressor and turbine. Other factors that  affect thermal efficiency are compressor inlet temperature  and combustion efficiency.  Figure 1-81  shows the effect that  changing compression ratio (compressor pressure ratio) has on  thermal efficiency when compressor inlet temperature and the  component efficiencies of the compressor and turbine remain  constant. The effects that compressor and turbine component  efficiencies have on thermal efficiency when turbine and  compressor inlet temperatures remain constant are shown in  Figure 1-82 . In actual operation, the turbine engine exhaust  temperature varies directly with turbine inlet temperature at  a constant compression ratio.  

Rpm is a direct measure of compression ratio; therefore, at  constant rpm, maximum thermal efficiency can be obtained  by maintaining the highest possible exhaust temperature.  Since engine life is greatly reduced at high turbine inlet  temperatures, the operator should not exceed the exhaust  temperatures specified for continuous operation.  Figure 1-83 illustrates the effect of turbine inlet temperature on turbine  blade life. In the previous discussion, it was assumed that  the state of the air at the inlet to the compressor remains  constant. Since this is a practical application of a turbine  engine, it becomes necessary to analyze the effect of varying  inlet conditions on the thrust or power produced. The three  principal variables that affect inlet conditions are the speed  of the aircraft, the altitude of the aircraft, and the ambient  temperature. To make the analysis simpler, the combination  of these three variables can be represented by a single variable  called stagnation density.  

The power produced by a turbine engine is proportional to  the stagnation density at the inlet. The next three illustrations  show how changing the density by varying altitude, airspeed,  and outside air temperature affects the power level of the  engine.  Figure 1-84  shows that the thrust output improves  rapidly with a reduction in outside air temperature (OAT) at  constant altitude, rpm, and airspeed. This increase occurs  partly because the energy required per pound of airflow to  drive the compressor varies directly with the temperature,  leaving more energy to develop thrust. In addition, the thrust  output increases since the air at reduced temperature has an  increased density. The increase in density causes the mass  flow through the engine to increase. The altitude effect on  thrust, as shown in  Figure 1-85 , can also be discussed as a  density and temperature effect. In this case, an increase in  altitude causes a decrease in pressure and temperature.  

Since the temperature lapse rate is lower than the pressure  lapse rate as altitude is increased, the density is decreased.  Although the decreased temperature increases thrust, the  effect of decreased density more than offsets the effect of  the colder temperature. The net result of increased altitude  is a reduction in the thrust output.  

The effect of airspeed on the thrust of a gas-turbine engine  is shown in  Figure 1-86 . To explain the airspeed effect, it  is necessary to understand first the effect of airspeed on the  factors that combine to produce net thrust: specific thrust  and engine airflow. Specific thrust is the net thrust in pounds  developed per pound of airflow per second. It is the remainder  of specific gross thrust minus specific ram drag. As airspeed  is increased, ram drag increases rapidly. The exhaust velocity  remains relatively constant; thus, the effect of the increase in

airspeed results in decreased specific thrust.  [Figure 1-86]  In  the low-speed range, the specific thrust decreases faster than  the airflow increases and causes a decrease in net thrust. As the  airspeed increases into the higher range, the airflow increases  faster than the specific thrust decreases and causes the net  thrust to increase until sonic velocity is reached. The effect  of the combination on net thrust is illustrated in  Figure 1-87 .  

# Ram Recovery  

A rise in pressure above existing outside atmospheric pressure  at the engine inlet, as a result of the forward velocity of an  aircraft, is referred to as ram pressure. Since any ram effect  causes an increase in compressor entrance pressure over  atmospheric, the resulting pressure rise causes an increase  in the mass airflow and gas velocity, both of which tend to  increase thrust. Although ram effect increases engine thrust,  the thrust being produced by the engine decreases for a given  throttle setting as the aircraft gains airspeed. Therefore, two  opposing trends occur when an aircraft’s speed is increased.  What actually takes place is the net result of these two  different effects.  

An engine’s thrust output temporarily decreases as aircraft  speed increases from static, but soon ceases to decrease.  Moving toward higher speeds, thrust output begins to increase  again due to the increased pressure of ram recovery.

# Chapter 2 Engine Fuel & Fuel Metering Systems  

# Fuel System Requirements  

The engine fuel system must supply fuel to the engine’s  fuel metering device under all conditions of ground and air  operation. It must function properly at constantly changing  altitudes and in any climate. The most common fuels are  AVGAS for reciprocating engines and Jet A for turbine  engines. AVGAS is generally either 80 (red) or 100LL (blue)  octane. The LL stands for low lead although it contains four  times the lead of 80 octane AVGAS. Jet A is a kerosene-based  fuel that is clear to straw in color.  

Electronic engine controls have allowed great increases in  controlling the metered fuel flow to the engine. Engine fuel  systems have become very accurate at providing the correct  mixture of fuel and air to the engines. Gas turbine fuel controls  have also greatly improved the ability to schedule (meter)  the fuel correctly during all flight regimes. Improvements in  electronics and the use of digital computers have enabled the  aircraft and engines to be electronically interfaced together.  By the use of electronic sensors and computer logic built  in to electronic controls, the engines can be controlled with  much more accuracy. Fuel cost and availability have also  become factors in providing engines with fuel systems  that are efficient and very precise in scheduling fuel flow  to the engine. Many engines use an interactive system that  senses engine parameters and feeds the information to the  onboard computer (electronic engine control). The computer  determines the amount of fuel needed and then sends a signal  to the metering device. This signal sent to the metering device  determines the correct amount of fuel needed by the engine.  Electronic controls have become quite common with gas  turbines and have increased the capabilities of the fuel system,  making it less complicated for the technician and decreasing  maintenance problems.  

Engine fuel systems can be fairly complicated, yet some are  quite simple, such as on small aircraft with a simple gravity- feed fuel system. This system, consisting of a tank to supply  fuel to the engine, is often installed in the overhead wing and  feeds a small float-type carburetor. On multiengine aircraft,  complex systems are necessary so that fuel can be pumped  from any combination of tanks to any combination of engines  through a crossfeed system. Provisions for transferring fuel  from one tank to another may also be included on large aircraft.  

# Vapor Lock  

All fuel systems should be designed so that vapor lock cannot  take place. Older gravity-feed systems were more prone to  vapor lock. The fuel system should be free of tendency to  vapor lock, which can result from changes in ground and  in-flight climatic conditions. Normally, the fuel remains in  a liquid state until it is discharged into the air stream and  then instantly changes to a vapor. Under certain conditions,  the fuel may vaporize in the lines, pumps, or other units.  The vapor pockets formed by this premature vaporization  restrict the fuel flow through units which are designed to  handle liquids rather than gases. The resulting partial or  complete interruption of the fuel flow is called vapor lock.  The three general causes of vapor lock are the lowering of the  pressure on the fuel, high fuel temperatures, and excessive  fuel turbulence.  

At high altitudes, the pressure on the fuel in the tank is low.  This lowers the boiling point of the fuel and causes vapor  bubbles to form. This vapor trapped in the fuel may cause  vapor lock in the fuel system.  

Transfer of heat from the engine tends to cause boiling of the  fuel in the lines and the pump. This tendency is increased if  the fuel in the tank is warm. High fuel temperatures often  combine with low pressure to increase vapor formation. This  is most apt to occur during a rapid climb on a hot day. As the  aircraft climbs, the outside temperature drops, but the fuel  does not lose temperature rapidly. If the fuel is warm enough  at takeoff, it retains enough heat to boil easily at high altitude.  The chief causes of fuel turbulence are sloshing of the fuel in  the tanks, the mechanical action of the engine-driven pump,  and sharp bends or rises in the fuel lines. Sloshing in the tank  tends to mix air with the fuel. As this mixture passes through  the lines, the trapped air separates from the fuel and forms  vapor pockets at any point where there are abrupt changes  in direction or steep rises. Turbulence in the fuel pump often  combines with the low pressure at the pump inlet to form a  vapor lock at this point.  

Vapor lock can become serious enough to block the fuel flow  completely and stop the engine. Even small amounts of vapor  in the inlet line restrict the flow to the engine-driven pump  and reduce its output pressure. To reduce the possibility of  vapor lock, fuel lines are kept away from sources of heat;  also, sharp bends and steep rises are avoided. In addition,  the volatility of the fuel is controlled in manufacture so that  it does not vaporize too readily. The major improvement in  reducing vapor lock, however, is the incorporation of booster  pumps in the fuel system. These booster pumps, which are  used widely in most modern aircraft, keep the fuel in the  lines to the engine-driven pump under pressure. The pressure  on the fuel reduces vapor formation and aids in moving a  vapor pocket along. The boost pump also releases vapor from  the fuel as it passes through the pump. The vapor moves  upward through the fuel in the tank and out the tank vents.  To prevent the small amount of vapor that remains in the  fuel from upsetting its metering action, vapor eliminators are  installed in some fuel systems ahead of the metering device  or are built into this unit.  

# Basic Fuel System  

The basic parts of a fuel system include tanks, boost pumps,  lines, selector valves, strainers, engine-driven pumps, and  pressure gauges. A review of fuel systems in the Aviation  Maintenance Technician—General Handbook provides some  information concerning these components.  

Generally, there are several tanks, even in a simple system, to  store the required amount of fuel. The location of these tanks  depends on both the fuel system design and the structural  design of the aircraft. From each tank, a line leads to the  selector valve. This valve is set from the flight deck to select  the tank from which fuel is to be delivered to the engine. The  boost pump forces fuel through the selector valve to the main  line strainer. This filtering unit, located in the lowest part of  the system, removes water and dirt from the fuel. During  starting, the boost pump forces fuel through a bypass in the  engine-driven pump to the metering device. Once the engine- driven pump is rotating at sufficient speed, it takes over and  delivers fuel to the metering device at the specified pressure.  

The airframe fuel system begins with the fuel tank and ends  at the engine fuel system. The engine fuel system usually  includes the engine-driven pumps and the fuel metering  systems. In aircraft powered with a reciprocating engine, the  engine-driven fuel pump and metering system consists of the  main components from the point at which the fuel enters the  first control unit until the fuel is injected into the intake pipe  or cylinder. For example, the engine fuel system of a typical  engine has an engine-driven fuel pump, the air-fuel control  unit (metering device), the fuel manifold valve, and the fuel  discharge nozzles. The fuel metering system on current  reciprocating engines meters the fuel at a predetermined  ratio to airflow. The airflow to the engine is controlled by  the carburetor or air-fuel control unit.  

The fuel metering system of the typical gas turbine engine  consists of an engine-driven pump, fuel flow transmitter,  fuel control with an electronic engine control, a distribution  system or manifold, flow divider, and fuel discharge nozzles.  On some turboprop engines, a fuel heater and a start control is  a part of the engine fuel system. The rate of fuel delivery can  be a function of air mass flow, compressor inlet temperature,  compressor discharge pressure, compressor revolutions per  minute (rpm), exhaust gas temperature, and combustion  chamber pressure.  

# Fuel Metering Devices for Reciprocating  Engines  

Basic principles of operation are discussed here with no attempt  being made to give detailed maintenance instructions. For the  specific information needed to inspect or maintain a particular  installation or unit, consult the manufacturer’s instructions.  

The basic requirement of a reciprocating fuel metering system  is the same, regardless of the type of system used or the model  engine on which the equipment is installed. It must meter fuel  proportionately to air to establish the proper air-fuel mixture  ratio for the engine at all speeds and altitudes at which the  engine may be operated. In the air-fuel mixture curves shown  in  Figure 2-1,  note that the basic best power and best economy  air-fuel mixture requirements for reciprocating engines are  approximately the same. The fuel metering system must  atomize and distribute the fuel from the carburetor into the  mass airflow. This must be accomplished so that the air-fuel  charges going to all cylinders holds equal amounts of fuel.  Each one of the engine’s cylinders should receive the same  quantity of air-fuel mixture and at the same air-fuel ratio.  

Due to the drop in atmospheric pressure as altitude is  increased, the density of the air also decreases. A normally- aspirated engine has a fixed amount or volume of air that  it can draw in during the intake stroke, therefore less air is  drawn into the engine as altitude increases. Less air tends to  make carburetors run richer at altitude than at ground level,  because of the decreased density of the airflow through  the carburetor throat for a given volume of air. Thus, it is  necessary that a mixture control be provided to lean the  mixture and compensate for this natural enrichment. Some  aircraft use carburetors in which the mixture control is  operated manually. Other aircraft employ carburetors which  automatically lean the carburetor mixture at altitude to  maintain the proper air-fuel mixture.  

The rich mixture requirements for an aircraft engine are  established by running a power curve to determine the air- fuel mixture for obtaining maximum usable power. This  curve is plotted at   $100~\mathrm{rpm}$   intervals from idle speed to

takeoff speed.  [Figure 2-2]  Since it is necessary in the power  range to add fuel to the basic air-fuel mixture requirements  to keep cylinder-head temperatures in a safe range, the fuel  mixture must become gradually richer as powers above  cruise are used.  [Figure 2-1]  In the power range, the engine  runs on a much leaner mixture, as indicated in the curves.  However, on the leaner mixture, cylinder-head temperature  would exceed the maximum permissible temperatures and  detonation would occur.  

The best economy setting is established by running a series  of curves through the cruise range, as shown in the graph in  Figure 2-3,  the low point (auto-lean) in the curve being the  air-fuel mixture where the minimum fuel per horsepower is  used. In this range the engine operates normally on slightly  leaner mixtures and obviously operates on richer mixtures  than the low-point mixture. If a mixture leaner than that  specified for the engine is used, the leanest cylinder of the  engine is apt to backfire because the slower burning rate of  the lean mixture results in a continued burning in the cylinder  when the next intake stroke starts.

# Air-Fuel Mixtures  

Gasoline and other liquid fuels do not burn at all unless they  are mixed with air. If the mixture is to burn properly within  the engine cylinder, the ratio of air to fuel must be kept  within a certain range. It would be more accurate to state that  the fuel is burned with the oxygen in the air. Seventy-eight  percent of air by volume is nitrogen, which is inert and does  not participate in the combustion process, and 21 percent is  oxygen. Heat is generated by burning the mixture of gasoline  and oxygen. Nitrogen and gaseous byproducts of combustion  absorb this heat energy and turn it into power by expansion.  The mixture proportion of fuel and air by weight is of extreme  importance to engine performance. The characteristics of a  given mixture can be measured in terms of flame speed and  combustion temperature.  

The composition of the air-fuel mixture is described by the  mixture ratio. For example, a mixture with a ratio of 12 to 1  (12:1) is made up of 12 pounds of air and 1 pound of fuel. The  ratio is expressed in weight because the volume of air varies  greatly with temperature and pressure. The mixture ratio can  also be expressed as a decimal. Thus, an air-fuel ratio of 12:1  and an air-fuel ratio of 0.083 describe the same mixture ratio.  Mixtures of air and gasoline as rich as 8:1 and as lean as 16:1  will burn in an engine cylinder, but beyond these mixtures,  either lean or rich blow out could occur. The engine develops  maximum power with a mixture of approximately 12 parts  of air and 1 part of gasoline by weight.  

From a chemist’s point of view, the perfect mixture for  combustion of fuel and air would be 0.067 pounds of fuel  to 1 pound of air (mixture ratio of 15:1). The scientist calls  this chemically correct combination a stoichiometric mixture  (pronounced stoy-key-o-metric). With this mixture (given  sufficient time and turbulence), all the fuel and all the oxygen  in the air is completely used in the combustion process. The  stoichiometric mixture produces the highest combustion  temperatures because the proportion of heat released to a  mass of charge (fuel and air) is the greatest. If more fuel is  added to the same quantity of air charge than the amount  giving a chemically perfect mixture, changes of power  and temperature occur. The combustion gas temperature is  lowered as the mixture is enriched, and the power increases  until the air-fuel ratio is approximately 0.0725. For mixtures  from 0.0725 air-fuel ratio to 0.080 air-fuel ratio, the power  remains essentially constant even though the combustion  temperature continues downward. Mixtures from 0.0725  air-fuel ratio to 0.080 air-fuel ratio are called best power  mixtures, since their use results in the greatest power for  a given airflow or manifold pressure. In this air-fuel ratio  range, there is no increase in the total heat released, but the  weight of nitrogen and combustion products is augmented  by the vapor formed with the excess fuel. Thus, the working  mass of the charge is increased. In addition, the extra fuel in  the charge (over the stoichiometric mixture) speeds up the  combustion process, which provides a favorable time factor  in converting fuel energy into power.  

If the air-fuel ratio is enriched above 0.080, there is loss of  power and a reduction in temperature. The cooling effects  of excess fuel overtake the favorable factor of increased  mass. This reduced temperature and slower rate of burning  lead to an increasing loss of combustion efficiency. If, with  constant airflow, the mixture is leaned below 0.067, air-fuel  ratio power and temperature decrease together. This time, the  loss of power is not a liability but an asset. The purpose in  leaning is to save fuel. Air is free and available in limitless  quantities. The object is to obtain the required power with  the least fuel flow. A measure of the economical use of fuel  is called specific fuel consumption (SFC), which is the fuel  weight in pounds per hour per horsepower.  

![](images/fea92109507dcaab5600125f98b32801ef815725afa65df5edc34ce773e87f29.jpg)  

By using this ratio, the engine’s use of fuel at various power  settings can be compared. When leaning below 0.067 air- fuel ratio with constant airflow, even though the power  diminishes, the cost in fuel to support each horsepower  hour (SFC) also is lowered. While the mixture charge is  becoming weaker, this loss of strength occurs at a rate  lower than that of the reduction of fuel flow. This favorable  tendency continues until a mixture strength known as best  economy is reached. With this air-fuel ratio, the required  hp is developed with the least fuel flow or, to put it another  way, the greatest power produced by a given fuel flow. The  best economy air-fuel ratio varies somewhat with rpm and  other conditions, but for cruise powers on most reciprocating  engines, it is sufficiently accurate to define this range of  operation as being from 0.060 to 0.065 air-fuel ratios on  aircraft where manual leaning is practiced.  

Below the best economical mixture strength, power and  temperature continue to fall with constant airflow while  the SFC increases. As the air-fuel ratio is reduced further,  combustion becomes so cool and slow that power for a  given manifold pressure gets so low as to be uneconomical.  The cooling effect of rich or lean mixtures results from the  excess fuel or air over that needed for combustion. Internal  cylinder cooling is obtained from unused fuel when air-fuel  ratios above 0.067 are used. The same function is performed  by excess air when air-fuel ratios below 0.067 are used.  

Varying the mixture strength of the charge produces  changes in the engine operating condition affecting power,  temperature, and spark-timing requirements. The best power  air-fuel ratio is desirable when the greatest power from a  given airflow is required. The best economy mixture results  from obtaining the given power output with the least fuel  flow. The air-fuel ratio which gives most efficient operation  varies with engine speed and power output.  

In the graph showing this variation in air-fuel ratio, note that  the mixture is rich at both idling and high-speed operation  and is lean through the cruising range.  [Figure 2-1]  At idling  speed, some air or exhaust gas is drawn into the cylinder  through the exhaust port during valve overlap. The mixture  that enters the cylinder through the intake port must be  rich enough to compensate for this gas or additional air. At  cruising power, lean mixtures save fuel and increase the range  of the airplane. An engine running near full power requires a  rich mixture to prevent overheating and detonation. Since the  engine is operated at full power for only short periods, the  

![](images/c6184bd0fe539a9056106180284e975911de08d4458e2e76cb0137bbdc48e0e4.jpg)  
Figure 2-4.   Simple venturi.  

high fuel consumption is not a serious matter. If an engine  is operating on a mixture that is too lean, and adjustments  are made to increase the amount of fuel, the power output  of the engine increases rapidly at first, then gradually until  maximum power is reached. With a further increase in the  amount of fuel, the power output drops gradually at first, then  more rapidly as the mixture is further enriched.  

There are specific instructions concerning mixture ratios  for each type of engine under various operating conditions.  Failure to follow these instructions results in poor  performance and often in damage to the engine. Excessively  rich mixtures result in loss of power and waste of fuel. With  the engine operating near its maximum output, very lean  mixtures cause a loss of power and, under certain conditions,  serious overheating. When the engine is operated on a  lean mixture, the cylinder head temperature gauge should  be watched closely. If the mixture is excessively lean, the  engine may backfire through the induction system or stop  completely. Backfire results from slow burning of the lean  mixture. If the charge is still burning when the intake valve  opens, it ignites the fresh mixture and the flame travels back  through the combustible mixture in the induction system.  

# Carburetion Principles  

# Venturi Principles  

The carburetor must measure the airflow through the  induction system and use this measurement to regulate  the amount of fuel discharged into the airstream. The air  measuring unit is the venturi, which makes use of a basic law  of physics: as the velocity of a gas or liquid increases, the  pressure decreases. As shown in  Figure 2-4,  simple venturi  is a passageway or tube in which there is a narrow portion  called the throat. As the velocity of the air increases to get  through the narrow portion, its pressure drops. Note that the  pressure in the throat is lower than that in any other part of  the venturi. This pressure drop is proportional to the velocity  and is, therefore, a measure of the airflow. The basic operating  principle of most carburetors depends on the differential  pressure between the inlet and the venturi throat.  

# Application of Venturi Principle to Carburetor  

The carburetor is mounted on the engine so that air to the  cylinders passes through the barrel, the part of the carburetor  which contains the venturi. The size and shape of the venturi  depends on the requirements of the engine for which the  carburetor is designed. A carburetor for a high-powered  engine may have one large venturi or several small ones. The  air may flow either up or down the venturi, depending on the  design of the engine and the carburetor. Those in which the  air passes downward are known as downdraft carburetors,  and those in which the air passes upward are called updraft  carburetors. Some carburetors are made to use a side draft  or horizontal air entry into the engine induction system, as  shown in  Figure 2-5 .  

Air flows through the induction system covered in Chapter  3. When a piston moves toward the crankshaft (down) on  the intake stroke, the pressure in the cylinder is lowered.

Figure 2-6.   Wide open throttle position.  

Air rushes through the carburetor and intake manifold to  the cylinder to replace the air displaced by the piston as it  moved down on the intake stroke. Due to this low pressure  area caused by the piston moving down, the higher pressure  air in the atmosphere flows in to fill the low pressure area.  As it does, the airflow must pass through the carburetor  venturi. The throttle valve is located between the venturi  and the engine. Mechanical linkage connects this valve with  the throttle lever in the flight deck. By means of the throttle,  airflow to the cylinders is regulated and controls the power  output of the engine. Actually, more air is admitted to the  engine, and the carburetor automatically supplies enough  additional gasoline to maintain the correct air-fuel ratio. This  is because as the volume of airflow increases, the velocity  in the venturi increases, lowering the pressure and allowing  more fuel to be forced into the airstream. The throttle valve  obstructs the passage of air very little when it is parallel with  the flow, in the wide open throttle position. Throttle action  is illustrated in  Figure 2-6 . Note how it restricts the airflow  more and more as it rotates toward the closed position.  

# Metering & Discharge of Fuel  

In  Figure 2-7,  showing the discharge of fuel into the airstream,  locate the inlet through which fuel enters the carburetor from  the engine-driven pump. The float-operated needle valve  regulates the flow through the inlet, which maintains the  correct level in the fuel float chamber.  [Figures 2-8  and  2-9] This level must be slightly below the outlet of the discharge  nozzle to prevent overflow when the engine is not running.  

The discharge nozzle is located in the throat of the venturi  at the point where the lowest drop in pressure occurs as  air passes through the carburetor to the engine cylinders.  There are two different pressures acting on the fuel in the  carburetor—a low pressure at the discharge nozzle and a  higher (atmospheric) pressure in the float chamber. The  higher pressure in the float chamber forces the fuel through

the discharge nozzle into the airstream. If the throttle is  opened wider to increase the airflow to the engine, there is  a greater drop in pressure at the venturi throat. Because of  the higher differential pressure, the fuel discharge increases  in proportion to the increase in airflow. If the throttle is  moved toward the “closed” position, the airflow and fuel  flow decrease.  

The fuel must pass through the metering jet to reach the  discharge nozzle.  [Figure 2-7]  A metering jet is really a  certain size hole that the fuel passes through. The size of this  jet determines the rate of fuel discharge at each differential  pressure. If the jet is replaced with a larger one, the fuel flow  increases, resulting in a richer mixture. If a smaller jet is  installed, there is a decrease in fuel flow and a leaner mixture.  

# Carburetor Systems  

To provide for engine operation under various loads and at  different engine speeds, each carburetor has six systems:  

1.	 Main metering, 2.	 Idling, 3.	 Accelerating, 4.	 Mixture control,  

# 5.	 Idle cutoff, and 6.	 Power enrichment or economizer.  

Each of these systems has a definite function. It may act alone  or with one or more of the others.  

The main metering system supplies fuel to the engine at all  speeds above idling. The fuel discharged by this system is  determined by the drop in pressure in the venturi throat.  

A separate system is necessary for idling because the main  metering system can be erratic at very low engine speeds.  At low speeds the throttle is nearly closed. As a result, the  velocity of the air through the venturi is low and there is little  drop in pressure. Consequently, the differential pressure is not  sufficient to operate the main metering system, and no fuel  is discharged from this system. Therefore, most carburetors  have an idling system to supply fuel to the engine at low  engine speeds.  

The accelerating system supplies extra fuel during sudden  increases in engine power. When the throttle is opened, the  airflow through the carburetor increases to obtain more  power from the engine. The main metering system then  increases the fuel discharge. During sudden acceleration,  however, the increase in airflow is so rapid that there is  a slight time lag before the increase in fuel discharge is  sufficient to provide the correct mixture ratio with the new  airflow. By supplying extra fuel during this period, the  accelerating system prevents a temporary leaning out of the  mixture and gives smooth acceleration.  

The mixture control system determines the ratio of fuel to  air in the mixture. By means of a flight deck control, the  manual mixture control can select the mixture ratio to suit  operating conditions. In addition to these manual controls,  many carburetors have automatic mixture controls so that  the air-fuel ratio, once it is selected, does not change with  variations in air density. This is necessary because as the  airplane climbs and the atmospheric pressure decreases,  there is a corresponding decrease in the weight of air passing  through the induction system. The volume, however,  remains constant. Since it is the volume of airflow that  determines the pressure drop at the throat of the venturi,  the carburetor tends to meter the same amount of fuel to  this thin air as to the dense air at sea level. Thus, the natural  tendency is for the mixture to become richer as the airplane  gains altitude. The automatic mixture control prevents this  by decreasing the rate of fuel discharge to compensate for  the decrease in air density.  

The carburetor has an idle cutoff system so that the fuel can  be shut off to stop the engine. This system, incorporated in  the manual mixture control, stops the fuel discharge from the  carburetor completely when the mixture control lever is set  to the “idle cutoff” position. An aircraft engine is stopped by  shutting off the fuel rather than by turning off the ignition. If  the ignition is turned off with the carburetor still supplying  fuel, fresh air-fuel mixture continues to pass through the  induction system to the cylinders. As the engine is coasting  to a stop and if it is excessively hot, this combustible mixture  may be ignited by local hot spots within the combustion  chambers. This can cause the engine to continue running  or kick backward. Also, the mixture may pass through  the cylinders unburned, but be ignited in the hot exhaust  manifold. Or, the engine comes to an apparently normal stop,  but a combustible mixture remains in the induction passages,  the cylinders, and the exhaust system. This is an unsafe  condition since the engine may kick over after it has been  stopped and seriously injure anyone near the propeller. When  the engine is shut down by means of the idle cutoff system,  the spark plugs continue to ignite the air-fuel mixture until the  fuel discharge from the carburetor ceases. This alone should  prevent the engine from coming to a stop with a combustible  mixture in the cylinders. Some engine manufacturers suggest  that just before the propeller stops turning, the throttle be  opened wide so that the pistons can pump fresh air through  the induction system, the cylinders, and the exhaust system  as an added precaution against accidental kick-over. After  the engine has come to a complete stop, the ignition switch  is turned to the “off” position.  

The power enrichment system automatically increases the  richness of the mixture during high power operation. It makes  possible the variation in air-fuel ratio necessary to fit different  operating conditions. Remember that at cruising speeds, a  lean mixture is desirable for economy reasons, while at high  power output, the mixture must be rich to obtain maximum  power and to aid in cooling the engine cylinders. The power  enrichment system automatically brings about the necessary  change in the air-fuel ratio. Essentially, it is a valve that is  closed at cruising speeds and opened to supply extra fuel  to the mixture during high power operation. Although it  increases the fuel flow at high power, the power enrichment  system is actually a fuel saving device. Without this system,  it would be necessary to operate the engine on a rich mixture  over the complete power range. The mixture would then  be richer than necessary at cruising speed to ensure safe  operation at maximum power. The power enrichment system  is sometimes called an economizer or a power compensator.  

Although the various systems have been discussed separately,  the carburetor functions as a unit. The fact that one system  is in operation does not necessarily prevent another from  functioning. At the same time that the main metering system  is discharging fuel in proportion to the airflow, the mixture  control system determines whether the resultant mixture  is rich or lean. If the throttle is suddenly opened wide, the  accelerating and power enrichment systems act to add fuel to  that already being discharged by the main metering system.  

# Carburetor Types  

There are two types of carburetor used on aircraft with  reciprocating engines—the float-type and the pressure-type.  The float-type carburetor, the most common of the two,  has several distinct disadvantages. The effect that abrupt  maneuvers have on the float action and the fact that its fuel  must be discharged at low pressure leads to incomplete  vaporization and difficulty in discharging fuel into some  types of supercharged systems. The chief disadvantage of the  float carburetor, however, is its icing tendency. Since the float  carburetor must discharge fuel at a point of low pressure, the  discharge nozzle must be located at the venturi throat, and  the throttle valve must be on the engine side of the discharge  nozzle. This means that the drop in temperature due to fuel  vaporization takes place within the venturi. As a result, ice  readily forms in the venturi and on the throttle valve.  

A pressure-type carburetor discharges fuel into the airstream  at a pressure well above atmospheric. This results in better  vaporization and permits the discharge of fuel into the  airstream on the engine side of the throttle valve. With the  discharge nozzle located at this point, the drop in temperature  due to fuel vaporization takes place after the air has passed  the throttle valve and at a point where engine heat tends  to offset it. Thus, the danger of fuel vaporization icing is  practically eliminated. The effects of rapid maneuvers and  rough air on the pressure-type carburetors are negligible  since its fuel chambers remain filled under all operating  conditions. Pressure carburetors have been replaced mostly  by fuel injection systems and have limited use on modern  aircraft engines.  

# Carburetor Icing  

There are three general classifications of carburetor icing:  

1.	 Fuel evaporation ice, 2.	 Throttle ice, and 3.	 Impact ice.  

Fuel evaporation ice or refrigeration ice is formed because of  the decrease in air temperature resulting from the evaporation  of fuel after it is introduced into the airstream. As the fuel  evaporates, the temperature is lowered in the area where  the evaporation takes place. Any moisture in the incoming  air can form ice in this area. It frequently occurs in those  systems in which fuel is injected into the air upstream  from the carburetor throttle, as in the case of float-type  carburetors. It occurs less frequently in systems in which the  fuel is injected into the air downstream from the carburetor.  Refrigeration ice can be formed at carburetor air temperatures  as high as  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   over a wide range of atmospheric humidity  conditions, even at relative humidity well below 100 percent.  Generally, fuel evaporation ice tends to accumulate on the  fuel distribution nozzle in the carburetor. This type of ice can  lower manifold pressure, interfere with fuel flow, and affect  mixture distribution.  

Throttle ice is formed on the rear side of the throttle, usually  when the throttle is in a partially “closed” position. The  rush of air across and around the throttle valve causes a low  pressure on the rear side; this sets up a pressure differential  across the throttle, which has a cooling effect on the air- fuel charge. Moisture freezes in this low pressure area and  collects as ice on the low pressure side. Throttle ice tends  to accumulate in a restricted passage. The occurrence of a  small amount of ice may cause a relatively large reduction in  airflow and manifold pressure. A large accumulation of ice  may jam the throttles and cause them to become inoperable.  Throttle ice seldom occurs at temperatures above   $38\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  

Impact ice is formed either from water present in the  atmosphere as snow, sleet, or from liquid water which  impinges on surfaces that are at temperatures below  $32\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  .  Because of inertia effects, impact ice collects on or near a  surface that changes the direction of the airflow. This type of ice  may build up on the carburetor elbow, as well as the carburetor  screen and metering elements. The most dangerous impact ice  is that which collects on the carburetor screen and causes a  very rapid reduction of airflow and power. In general, danger  from impact ice normally exists only when ice forms on the  leading edges of the aircraft structure. Under some conditions,  ice may enter the carburetor in a comparatively dry state and  will not adhere to the inlet screen or walls or affect engine  airflow or manifold pressure. This ice may enter the carburetor  and gradually build up internally in the carburetor air metering  passages and affect carburetor metering characteristics.  

# Float-Type Carburetors  

A float-type carburetor consists essentially of six subsystems  that control the quantity of fuel discharged in relation to the  flow of air delivered to the engine cylinders. These systems  work together to provide the engine with the correct fuel flow  during all engine operating ranges.  

The essential subsystems of a float-type carburetor are  illustrated in  Figure 2-10 . These systems are:  

1.	 Float chamber mechanism system, 2.	 Main metering system, 3.	 Idling system, 4.	 Mixture control system,  

![](images/e21bbdbfde92f98248776c63a81f6944420f4897d1faf88e2f39ab58f3cdcf83.jpg)  
Figure 2-10.   A float-type carburetor.  

5.	 Accelerating system, and 6.	 Economizer system.  

# Float Chamber Mechanism System  

A float chamber is provided between the fuel supply and the  main metering system of the carburetor. The float chamber,  or bowl, serves as a reservoir for fuel in the carburetor.  [Figure 2-11]  This chamber provides a nearly constant level  of fuel to the main discharge nozzle which is usually about
  $\mathrm{\mathrm{\%"}}$   below the holes in the main discharge nozzle. The fuel  level must be maintained slightly below the discharge nozzle  outlet holes to provide the correct amount of fuel flow and  to prevent fuel leakage from the nozzle when the engine is  not operating.  

The level of fuel in the float chamber is kept nearly constant by  means of a float-operated needle valve and a seat. The needle  seat is usually made of bronze. The needle valve is constructed  of hardened steel, or it may have a synthetic rubber section  which fits the seat. With no fuel in the float chamber, the float  drops toward the bottom of the chamber and allows the needle  valve to open wide. As fuel is admitted from the supply line,  the float rises (floats in the fuel) and closes the needle valve  when the fuel reaches a predetermined level. When the engine  is running, and fuel is being drawn out of the float chamber,  the valve assumes an intermediate position so that the valve  opening is just sufficient to supply the required amount of  fuel and keep the level constant.  [Figure 2-10]  If fuel is found  leaking from the discharge nozzle of the carburetor when the  engine is not running, the most likely cause is that the float  needle valve and seat is leaking and needs to be replaced.  

With the fuel at the correct level (float chamber), the  discharge rate is controlled accurately by the air velocity  through the carburetor venturi where a pressure drop at the  discharge nozzle causes fuel to flow into the intake airstream.  Atmospheric pressure on top of the fuel in the float chamber  

![](images/21fef41a086050730b80b84f16ec342c24c7d68721243e8b5319f9ead5f0672b.jpg)

forces the fuel out the discharge nozzle. A vent or small  opening in the top of the float chamber allows air to enter or  leave the chamber as the level of fuel rises or falls.  

# Main Metering System  

The main metering system supplies fuel to the engine at all  speeds above idling and consists of:  

1.	 Venturi, 2.	 Main metering jet, 3.	 Main discharge nozzle, 4.	 Passage leading to the idling system, and 5.	 Throttle valve.  

Since the throttle valve controls the mass airflow through  the carburetor venturi, it must be considered a major unit  in the main metering system as well as in other carburetor  systems. A typical main metering system is illustrated in  Figure 2-12 . The venturi performs three functions:  

1.	 Proportions the air-fuel mixture, 2.	 Decreases the pressure at the discharge nozzle, and 3.	 Limits the airflow at full throttle.  

The fuel discharge nozzle is located in the carburetor barrel  so that its open end is in the throat or narrowest part of the  

![](images/e60a7568c543ea03471c54b718d5f0ea80b505b45c725fc1798247ee364ce6cb.jpg)  
Figure 2-12.   Main metering system.  

venturi. A main metering orifice, or jet, is placed in the fuel  passage between the float chamber and the discharge nozzle  to limit the fuel flow when the throttle valve is wide open.  

When the engine crankshaft is revolved with the carburetor  throttle open, the low pressure created in the intake manifold  acts on the air passing through the carburetor barrel. Due  to the difference in pressure between the atmosphere and  the intake manifold, air flows from the air intake through  the carburetor barrel into the intake manifold. The volume  of airflow depends upon the degree of throttle opening. As  the air flows through the venturi, its velocity increases. This  velocity increase creates a low pressure area in the venturi  throat. The fuel discharge nozzle is exposed to this low  pressure. Since the float chamber is vented to atmospheric  pressure, a pressure drop across the discharge nozzle is  created. It is this pressure difference, or metering force, that  causes fuel to flow from the discharge nozzle. The fuel comes  out of the nozzle in a fine spray, and the tiny particles of fuel  in the spray quickly vaporize in the air.  

The metering force (pressure differential) in most carburetors  increases as the throttle opening is increased. The fuel must be  raised in the discharge nozzle to a level at which it discharges  into the airstream. To accomplish this, a pressure differential of   $0.5\,"\mathrm{Hg}$   is required. When the metering force is considerably  reduced at low engine speeds, the fuel delivery from the  discharge nozzle decreases if an air bleed (air metering jet) is  not incorporated in the carburetor. The decrease in fuel flow  in relation to airflow is due to two factors:  

1.	 The fuel tends to adhere to the walls of the discharge  nozzle and break off intermittently in large drops  instead of forming a fine spray.  

2.	 A part of the metering force is required to raise the  fuel level from the float chamber level to the discharge  

# nozzle outlet.  

The basic principle of the air bleed can be explained by  simple diagrams, as shown in  Figure 2-13 . In each case, the  same degree of suction is applied to a vertical tube placed in  the container of liquid. As shown in A, the suction applied  on the upper end of the tube is sufficient to lift the liquid a  distance of about 1 inch above the surface. If a small hole is  made in the side of the tube above the surface of the liquid,  as in B, and suction is applied, bubbles of air enter the tube  and the liquid is drawn up in a continuous series of small  slugs or drops. Thus, air “bleeds” into the tube and partially  reduces the forces tending to retard the flow of liquid through  the tube. However, the large opening at the bottom of the  tube effectively prevents any great amount of suction from  being exerted on the air bleed hole or vent. Similarly, an air  bleed hole that is too large in proportion to the size of the  tube would reduce the suction available to lift the liquid. If  the system is modified by placing a metering orifice in the  bottom of the tube and air is taken in below the fuel level by  means of an air bleed tube, a finely divided mixture of air  and liquid is formed in the tube, as shown in C.  

In a carburetor, a small air bleed is bled into the fuel nozzle  slightly below the fuel level. The open end of the air bleed is  in the space behind the venturi wall where the air is relatively  motionless and at approximately atmospheric pressure. The
 low pressure at the tip of the nozzle not only draws fuel from  the float chamber but also draws air from behind the venturi.  Air bled into the main metering fuel system decreases the  fuel density and destroys surface tension. This results in  better vaporization and control of fuel discharge, especially  at lower engine speeds. The throttle, or butterfly valve, is  located in the carburetor barrel near one end of the venturi.  It provides a means of controlling engine speed or power  output by regulating the airflow to the engine. This valve is

a disc that can rotate on an axis, so that it can be turned to  open or close the carburetor air passage.  

# Idling System  

With the throttle valve closed at idling speeds, air velocity  through the venturi is so low that it cannot draw enough fuel  from the main discharge nozzle; in fact, the spray of fuel  may stop altogether. However, low pressure (piston suction)  exists on the engine side of the throttle valve. In order to  allow the engine to idle, a fuel passageway is incorporated to  discharge fuel from an opening in the low pressure area near  the edge of the throttle valve.  [Figure 2-14]  This opening is  called the idling jet. With the throttle open enough so that the  main discharge nozzle is operating, fuel does not flow out  of the idling jet. As soon as the throttle is closed far enough  to stop the spray from the main discharge nozzle, fuel flows  out the idling jet. A separate air bleed, known as the idle air  bleed, is included as part of the idling system. It functions  in the same manner as the main air bleed. An idle mixture  adjusting device is also incorporated. A typical idling system  is illustrated in  Figure 2-15 .  

# Mixture Control System  

As altitude increases, the air becomes less dense. At an  altitude of 18,000 feet, the air is only half as dense as it is  at sea level. This means that a cubic foot of space contains  only half as much air at 18,000 feet as at sea level. An engine  cylinder full of air at 18,000 feet contains only half as much  oxygen as a cylinder full of air at sea level.  

The low pressure area created by the venturi is dependent upon  air velocity rather than air density. The action of the venturi  draws the same volume of fuel through the discharge nozzle  at a high altitude as it does at a low altitude. Therefore, the  fuel mixture becomes richer as altitude increases. This can be  overcome either by a manual or an automatic mixture control.  

![](images/466e4431e7649c12f7ff1d387c92b29160d647f121da8409ccdfe8b9403abee7.jpg)  
Figure 2-15.   Idling system.  

On float-type carburetors, two types of purely manual  or flight deck controllable devices are in general use for  controlling air-fuel mixtures, the needle type and the back- suction type.  [Figures 2-16  and  2-17]  

With the needle-type system, manual control is provided by a  

![](images/c59dbf69090b9c95aa12c451d4ec722e35d3a38280b30d2dd5e24006e27cd03c.jpg)

Figure 2-17.   Back-suction-type mixture control system.  

needle valve in the base of the float chamber.  [Figure 2-16]  This  can be raised or lowered by adjusting a control in the flight  deck. Moving the control to “rich,” opens the needle  valve wide, which permits the fuel to flow unrestricted
 to the nozzle. Moving the control to “lean,” partially closes  the valve and restricts the flow of fuel to the nozzle.  

The back-suction-type mixture control system is the most  widely used.  [Figure 2-17]  In this system, a certain amount  of venturi low pressure acts upon the fuel in the float  chamber so that it opposes the low pressure existing at the  main discharge nozzle. An atmospheric line, incorporating  an adjustable valve, opens into the float chamber. When the  valve is completely closed, pressures on the fuel in the float  chamber and at the discharge nozzle are almost equal, and fuel  flow is reduced to maximum lean. With the valve wide open,  pressure on the fuel in the float chamber is greatest and fuel  mixture is richest. Adjusting the valve to positions between  these two extremes controls the mixture. The quadrant in  the flight deck is usually marked “lean” near the back end  and “rich” at the forward end. The extreme back position is  marked “idle cutoff” and is used when stopping the engine.  

On float carburetors equipped with needle-type mixture  control, placing the mixture control in idle cutoff seats the  needle valve, thus shutting off fuel flow completely. On  carburetors equipped with back-suction mixture controls, a  separate idle cutoff line, leading to the extreme low pressure  on the engine side of the throttle valve, is incorporated. (See  the dotted line in  Figure 2-17. ) The mixture control is so  linked that when it is placed in the “idle cutoff” position,  it opens another passage that leads to piston suction. When  placed in other positions, the valve opens a passage leading to  the atmosphere. To stop the engine with such a system, close  the throttle and place the mixture in the “idle cutoff” position.  Leave the throttle in the closed position until the engine has  stopped running and then open the throttle completely.  

# Accelerating System  

When the throttle valve is opened quickly, a large volume  of air rushes through the air passage of the carburetor; the  amount of fuel that is mixed with the air is less than normal  due to the slow response rate of the main metering system.  As a result, after a quick opening of the throttle, the air-fuel  mixture leans out momentarily. This can cause the engine to  accelerate slowly or stumble as it tries to accelerate.  

To overcome this tendency, the carburetor is equipped with a  small fuel pump called an accelerating pump. A common type  of accelerating system used in float carburetors is illustrated  in  Figure 2-18 . It consists of a simple piston pump operated  through linkage by the throttle control and a passageway  opening into the main metering system or the carburetor  barrel near the venturi. When the throttle is closed, the piston  moves back, and fuel fills the cylinder. If the piston is pushed  forward slowly, the fuel seeps past it back into the float  chamber; if pushed rapidly, it sprays fuel in the venturi and  enriches the mixture. An example of a cutaway accelerator  pump is shown in  Figure 2-19 .  

# Economizer System  

For an engine to develop maximum power at full throttle, the  fuel mixture must be richer than for cruise. The additional  fuel is used for cooling the engine combustion chambers to  prevent detonation. An economizer is essentially a valve  that is closed at throttle settings below approximately 60–70  

![](images/c688ad0eb344e0b26863bc26165ef4e1128b7506014146ef729d4c27896431df.jpg)

Figure 2-19.   Accelerating pump shown in cutaway.  

percent of rated power. This system, like the accelerating  system, is operated by the throttle control.  

A typical economizer system consists of a needle valve  which begins to open when the throttle valve reaches  a predetermined point near the wide-open position.  [Figure 2-20]  As the throttle continues to open, the needle  valve is opened further and additional fuel flows through  it. This additional fuel supplements the flow from the main  metering jet direct to the main discharge nozzle.  

A pressure-operated economizer system is shown in  Figure 2-21 . This type has a sealed bellows located in an  enclosed compartment. The compartment is vented to engine  manifold pressure. When the manifold pressure reaches a  

![](images/d92411cb424bc262ca215e9f968ecfb5e86d53b2917ad1ed130302dcce5d2913.jpg)  
Figure 2-20.   A needle-valve type economizer system.  

certain value, the bellows is compressed and opens a valve in  a carburetor fuel passage, supplementing the normal quantity  of fuel being discharged through the main nozzle.  

Another type of economizer is the back-suction system.  [Figure 2-22]  Fuel economy in cruising is provided by  reducing the effective pressure acting on the fuel level in  the float compartment. With the throttle valve in cruising  position, suction is applied to the float chamber through an  economizer hole and back-suction economizer channel and  jet. The suction applied to the float chamber opposes the  nozzle suction applied by the venturi. Fuel flow is reduced,  leaning the mixture for cruising economy.  

Another type of mixture control system uses a metering valve  that is free to rotate in a stationary metering sleeve. Fuel  enters the main and idling systems through a slot cut in the  mixture sleeve. Fuel metering is accomplished by the relative  position between one edge of the slot in the hollow metering  valve and one edge of the slot in the metering sleeve. Moving  the mixture control to reduce the size of the slot provides a  leaner mixture for altitude compensation.  

# Pressure Injection Carburetors  

Pressure injection carburetors are distinctly different from  float-type carburetors as they do not incorporate a vented  float chamber or suction pickup from a discharge nozzle  located in the venturi tube. Instead, they provide a pressurized  fuel system that is closed from the engine fuel pump to the  discharge nozzle. The venturi serves only to create pressure  differentials for controlling the quantity of fuel to the  metering jet in proportion to airflow to the engine.  

![](images/b706735cad57da4c3377a49b079f2cb7042ed2491302a3e832e18bcca718b1e6.jpg)

# Typical Injection Carburetor  

The injection carburetor is a hydromechanical device  employing a closed feed system from the fuel pump to the  discharge nozzle. It meters fuel through fixed jets according  to the mass airflow through the throttle body and discharges  it under a positive pressure.  

The illustration in  Figure 2-23  represents a pressure-type  carburetor simplified so that only the basic parts are shown.  Note the two small passages, one leading from the carburetor  air inlet to the left side of the flexible diaphragm and the other  from the venturi throat to the right side of the diaphragm.  

When air passes through the carburetor to the engine, the  pressure on the right of the diaphragm is lowered because  of the drop in pressure at the venturi throat. As a result, the  diaphragm moves to the right, opening the fuel valve. Pressure  from the engine-driven pump then forces fuel through the  open valve to the discharge nozzle, where it sprays into the  airstream. The distance the fuel valve opens is determined  by the difference between the two pressures acting on the  diaphragm. This difference in pressure is proportional to the  airflow through the carburetor. Thus, the volume of airflow  determines the rate of fuel discharge.  

The pressure injection carburetor is an assembly of the  following units:  

1.	 Throttle body, 2.	 Automatic mixture control, 3.	 Regulator unit, and  

![](images/e340e326f1cabd355a30cb17f140c0c96128a48c8d1d120ebe360607a0e2bbbe.jpg)  
Figure 2-23.   Pressure-type carburetor.  

4.	 Fuel control unit (some are equipped with an adapter).  

# Throttle Body  

The throttle body contains the throttle valves, main venturi,  boost venturi, and the impact tubes. All air entering the  cylinders must flow through the throttle body; therefore, it is  the air control and measuring device. The airflow is measured  by volume and by weight so that the proper amount of fuel can  be added to meet the engine demands under all conditions. As air flows through the venturi, its velocity is increased,  and its pressure is decreased (Bernoulli’s principle). This  low pressure is vented to the low pressure side of the  air diaphragm  [Figure 2-24 chamber B]  in the regulator  assembly. The impact tubes sense carburetor inlet air pressure  and direct it to the automatic mixture control, which measures  the air density. From the automatic mixture control, the air  is directed to the high pressure side of the air diaphragm  (chamber A). The pressure differential of the two chambers  acting upon the air diaphragm is known as the air metering  force which opens the fuel poppet valve.  

The throttle body controls the airflow with the throttle valves.  The throttle valves may be either rectangular or disc shaped,  depending on the design of the carburetor. The valves are  mounted on a shaft, which is connected by linkage to the  idle valve and to the throttle control in the flight deck. A  throttle stop limits the travel of the throttle valve and has an  adjustment which sets engine idle speed.  

# Regulator Unit  

The regulator is a diaphragm-controlled unit divided into  five chambers and contains two regulating diaphragms  and a poppet valve assembly.  [Figure 2-24]  Chamber A is  

![](images/21869e48eab317e544f1fdc7bce555e44518f64ee30f66bd6a59c2125beb2320.jpg)  
Figure 2-24.   Regulator unit.  

regulated air-inlet pressure from the air intake. Chamber B  is boost venturi pressure. Chamber C contains metered fuel  pressure controlled by the discharge nozzle or fuel feed valve.  Chamber D contains unmetered fuel pressure controlled by  the opening of the poppet valve. Chamber E is fuel pump  pressure controlled by the fuel pump pressure relief valve.  The poppet valve assembly is connected by a stem to the two  main control diaphragms. The purpose of the regulator unit is  to regulate the fuel pressure to the inlet side of the metering  jets in the fuel control unit. This pressure is automatically  regulated according to the mass airflow to the engine.  

The carburetor fuel strainer (also called the gascolator),  located in the inlet to chamber E, is a fine mesh screen through  which all the fuel must pass as it enters chamber D. The  strainer must be removed and cleaned at scheduled intervals.  

Referring to  Figure 2-24 , assume that for a given airflow  in lb/hr through the throttle body and venturi, a negative  pressure of   $\%$   psi is established in chamber B. This tends  to move the diaphragm assembly and the poppet valve in a  direction to open the poppet valve permitting more fuel to  enter chamber D. The pressure in chamber C is held constant  at 5 psi (10 psi on some installations) by the discharge  nozzle or impeller fuel feed valve. Therefore, the diaphragm  assembly and poppet valve moves in the open direction until  the pressure in chamber D is   $5\%$   psi. Under these pressures,  there is a balanced condition of the diaphragm assembly with  a pressure drop of  1 ⁄  psi across the jets in the fuel control unit  4 (auto-rich or auto-lean).  

If nozzle pressure (chamber C pressure) rises to  $5\%$   psi, the  diaphragm assembly balance is upset, and the diaphragm  assembly moves to open the poppet valve to establish  the necessary   $5\%$   psi pressure in chamber D. Thus, the   $\%$  psi differential between chamber C and chamber D is re- established, and the pressure drop across the metering jets  remains the same.  

If the fuel inlet pressure is increased or decreased, the fuel  flow into chamber D tends to increase or decrease with  the pressure change causing the chamber D pressure to do  likewise. This upsets the balanced condition previously  established, and the poppet valve and diaphragm assembly  respond by moving to increase or decrease the flow to re- establish the pressure at the  $\%$   psi differential.  

The fuel flow changes when the mixture control plates  are moved from auto-lean to auto-rich, thereby selecting  a different set of jets or cutting one or two in or out of the  system. When the mixture position is altered, the diaphragm  and poppet valve assembly repositions to maintain the  established pressure differential of  $\%$   psi between chambers  C and D, maintaining the established differential across the  jets. Under low power settings (low airflows), the difference  in pressure created by the boost venturi is not sufficient to  accomplish consistent regulation of the fuel. Therefore, an idle  spring, shown in  Figure 2-24 , is incorporated in the regulator.  As the poppet valve moves toward the closed position, it  contacts the idle spring. The spring holds the poppet valve  off its seat far enough to provide more fuel than is needed  for idling. This potentially overrich mixture is regulated by  the idle valve. At idling speed, the idle valve restricts the fuel  flow to the proper amount. At higher speeds, it is withdrawn  from the fuel passage and has no metering effect.  

Vapor vent systems are provided in these carburetors to  eliminate fuel vapor created by the fuel pump, heat in the  engine compartment, and the pressure drop across the poppet  valve. The vapor vent is located in the fuel inlet (chamber E)  or, on some models of carburetors, in both chambers D and E.  

The vapor vent system operates in the following way. When  air enters the chamber in which the vapor vent is installed,  the air rises to the top of the chamber, displacing the fuel  and lowering its level. When the fuel level has reached a  predetermined position, the float (which floats in the fuel)  pulls the vapor vent valve off its seat, permitting the vapor  in the chamber to escape through the vapor vent seat, its  connecting line, and back to the fuel tank.  

If the vapor vent valve sticks in a closed position or the vent  line from the vapor vent to the fuel tank becomes clogged, the  vapor-eliminating action is stopped. This causes the vapor to  build up within the carburetor to the extent that vapor passes  through the metering jets with the fuel. With a given size  carburetor metering jet, the metering of vapor reduces the  quantity of fuel metered. This causes the air-fuel mixture to  lean out, usually intermittently.  

If the vapor vent valve sticks open or the vapor vent float  becomes filled with fuel and sinks, a continuous flow of  fuel and vapor occurs through the vent line. It is important  to detect this condition, as the fuel flow from the carburetor  to the fuel supply tank may cause an overflowing tank with  resultant increased fuel consumption.  

To check the vent system, disconnect the vapor vent line  where it attaches to the carburetor, and turn the fuel booster  pump on while observing the vapor vent connection at the  carburetor. Move the carburetor mixture control to auto-rich;  then return it to idle cutoff. When the fuel booster pump is  turned on, there should be an initial ejection of fuel and air  followed by a cutoff with not more than a steady drip from  the vent connection. Installations with a fixed bleed from the  D chamber connected to the vapor vent in the fuel inlet by a  short external line should show an initial ejection of fuel and  air followed by a continuing small stream of fuel. If there  is no flow, the valve is sticking closed; if there is a steady  flow, it is sticking open.  

# Fuel Control Unit  

The fuel control unit is attached to the regulator assembly  and contains all metering jets and valves.  [Figure 2-25]  The  idle and power enrichment valves, together with the mixture  control plates, select the jet combinations for the various  settings (i.e., auto-rich, auto-lean, and idle cutoff).  

The purpose of the fuel control unit is to meter and control  the fuel flow to the discharge nozzle. The basic unit consists  of three jets and four valves arranged in series, parallel, and  series-parallel hookups.  [Figure 2-25]  These jets and valves  receive fuel under pressure from the regulator unit and then  meter the fuel as it flows to the discharge nozzle. The manual  mixture control valve controls the fuel flow. By using proper  size jets and regulating the pressure differential across the  jets, the right amount of fuel is delivered to the discharge  nozzle, giving the desired air-fuel ratio in the various power  settings. It should be remembered that the inlet pressure to the  jets is regulated by the regulator unit and the outlet pressure  is controlled by the discharge nozzle.  

The jets in the basic fuel control unit are the auto-lean jet, the  auto-rich jet, and power enrichment jet. The basic fuel flow  is the fuel required to run the engine with a lean mixture and  is metered by the auto-lean jet. The auto-rich jet adds enough  fuel to the basic flow to give a slightly richer mixture than  

![](images/8788676c4567fcb8a61bae602d869c75d59474eff1823bce41b11e50fac0abb7.jpg)  
Figure 2-25.   Fuel control unit.  

best power mixture when the manual mixture control is in  the auto-rich position.  

The four valves in the basic fuel control unit are:  

1.	 Idle needle valve, 2.	 Power enrichment valve, 3.	 Regulator fill valve, and 4.	 Manual mixture control.  

The functions of these valves are:  

1.	 The idle needle valve meters the fuel in the idle  range only. It is a round, contoured needle valve, or a  cylinder valve placed in series with all other metering  devices of the basic fuel control unit. The idle needle  valve is connected by linkage to the throttle shaft so  that it restricts the fuel flowing at low power settings  (idle range).  

2.	 The manual mixture control is a rotary disc valve  consisting of a round stationary disc with ports leading  from the auto-lean jet, the auto-rich jet, and two  smaller ventholes. Another rotating part, resembling  a cloverleaf, is held against the stationary disc by  spring tension and rotated over the ports in that disc  by the manual mixture control lever. All ports and  vents are closed in the idle cutoff position. In the auto- lean position, the ports from the auto-lean jet and the  two ventholes are open. The port from the auto-rich  jet remains closed in this position. In the auto-rich  position, all ports are open. The valve plate positions  

![](images/f513f74aa8a1cfc336ebaa5ebe992ab65e1821e0fb2317c900d6391333217bb2.jpg)  
Figure 2-26.   Manual mixture control valve plate positions.  

are illustrated in  Figure 2-26 . The three positions of  the manual mixture control lever make it possible to  select a lean mixture a rich mixture, or to stop fuel flow  entirely. The idle cutoff position is used for starting or  stopping the engine. During starting, fuel is supplied  by the primer.  

3.	 The regulator fill valve is a small poppet-type valve  located in a fuel passage which supplies chamber C  of the regulator unit with metered fuel pressure. In  idle cutoff, the flat portion of the cam lines up with  the valve stem, and a spring closes the valve. This  provides a means of shutting off the fuel flow to  chamber C and thus provides for a positive idle cutoff.  

4.	 The power enrichment valve is another poppet-type  valve. It is in parallel with the auto-lean and auto-rich  jets, but it is in series with the power enrichment jet.  This valve starts to open at the beginning of the power  range. It is opened by the unmetered fuel pressure  overcoming metered fuel pressure and spring tension.  The power enrichment valve continues to open wider  during the power range until the combined flow  through the valve and the auto-rich jet exceeds that  of the power enrichment jet. At this point the power
 enrichment jet takes over the metering and meters fuel  throughout the power range.  

5.	 Carburetors equipped for water injection are modified  by the addition of a derichment valve and a derichment  jet. The derichment valve and derichment jet are in  series with each other and parallel with the power  enrichment jet.  

The carburetor controls fuel flow by varying two basic  factors. The fuel control unit, acting as a pressure-reducing  valve, determines the metering pressure in response to the  metering forces. The regulator unit, in effect, varies the size  of the orifice through which the metering pressure forces  the fuel. It is a basic law of hydraulics that the amount of  fluid that passes through an orifice varies with the size of the  orifice and the pressure drop across it. The internal automatic  devices and mixture control act together to determine the  effective size of the metering passage through which the fuel  passes. The internal devices, fixed jets, and variable power  enrichment valve are not subject to direct external control.  

# Automatic Mixture Control (AMC)  

The automatic mixture control unit consists of a bellows  assembly, calibrated needle, and seat.  [Figure 2-27]  The  purpose of the automatic mixture control is to compensate for  changes in air density due to temperature and altitude changes.  

The automatic mixture control contains a metallic bellows,  which is sealed at  $28\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   absolute pressure. The bellows  responds to changes in pressure and temperature. In the  illustration, the automatic mixture control is located at the  carburetor air inlet. As the density of the air changes, the  expansion and contraction of the bellows moves the tapered  needle in the atmospheric line. At sea level, the bellows  is contracted, and the needle is not in the atmospheric  passage. As the aircraft climbs and the atmospheric pressure  decreases, the bellows expands, inserting the tapered  needle farther and farther into the atmospheric passage  and restricting the flow of air to chamber A of the regulator  unit.  [Figure 2-24]  At the same time, air leaks slowly from  chamber A to chamber B through the small bleed (often  referred to as the back-suction bleed or mixture control  bleed). The rate at which air leaks through this bleed is  about the same at high altitude as it is at sea level. As the  tapered needle restricts the flow of air into chamber A, the  pressure on the left side of the air diaphragm decreases. As  

![](images/372d91f57c355bd963ee28284069b05c40cfdc1c8edc075fddc2677c60dab776.jpg)  
Figure 2-27.   Automatic mixture control and throttle body.  

a result, the poppet valve moves toward its seat, reducing  the fuel flow to compensate for the decrease in air density.  

The automatic mixture control can be removed and cleaned  if the lead seal at the point of adjustment is not disturbed.  

# Stromberg PS Carburetor  

The PS series carburetor is a low-pressure, single-barrel,  injection-type carburetor. The carburetor consists basically  of the air section, the fuel section, and the discharge nozzle  mounted together to form a complete fuel metering system.  This carburetor is similar to the pressure-injection carburetor;  therefore, its operating principles are the same.  

In this type carburetor, metering is accomplished on a mass  airflow basis.  [Figure 2-28]  Air flowing through the main  venturi creates suction at the throat of the venturi, which  is transmitted to the B chamber in the main regulating part  of the carburetor and to the vent side of the fuel discharge  nozzle diaphragm. The incoming air pressure is transmitted  to a chamber A of the regulating part of the carburetor and  to the main discharge bleed in the main fuel discharge jet.  The discharge nozzle consists of a spring-loaded diaphragm  connected to the discharge nozzle valve, which controls the  

![](images/adc6994aa10468f8d837f6a6505d28f4fec4feb83a11c7fa6022f4db24c6370f.jpg)  
Figure 2-28.   Schematic of the PS series carburetor.  

flow of fuel injected into the main discharge jet. Here, it is  mixed with air to accomplish distribution and atomization  into the airstream entering the engine.  

In the PS series carburetor, as in the pressure-injection  carburetor, the regulator spring has a fixed tension, which  tends to hold the poppet valve open during idling speeds  or until the D chamber pressure equals approximately 4  psi. The discharge nozzle spring has a variable adjustment  which, when tailored to maintain 4 psi, results in a balanced  pressure condition of 4 psi in chamber C of the discharge  nozzle assembly and 4 psi in chamber D. This produces a  zero drop across the main jets at zero fuel flow.  

At a given airflow, if the suction created by the venturi is  equivalent to   $\%$    pound, the pressure decrease is transmitted  to chamber B and to the vent side of the discharge nozzle.  Since the area of the air diaphragm between chambers A  and B is twice as great as that between chambers B and D,  the  $\%$   pound decrease in pressure in chamber B moves the  diaphragm assembly to the right to open the poppet valve.  Meanwhile, the decreased pressure on the vent side of the  discharge nozzle assembly causes a lowering of the total  pressure from 4 pounds to  $3\%$   pounds. The greater pressure  of the metered fuel (  $4\%$   pounds) results in a differential across  the metering head of   $\%$   pound (for the   $\%$   pound pressure  differential created by the venturi).  

The same ratio of pressure drop across the jet to venturi  suction applies throughout the range. Any increase or  decrease in fuel inlet pressure tends to upset the balance in  the various chambers in the manner already described. When  this occurs, the main fuel regulator diaphragm assembly  repositions to restore the balance.  

The mixture control, whether operated manually or  automatically, compensates for enrichment at altitude  by bleeding impact air pressure into chamber B, thereby  increasing the pressure (decreasing the suction) in chamber  B. Increasing the pressure in chamber B tends to move the  diaphragm and poppet valve more toward the closed position,  restricting fuel flow to correspond proportionately to the  decrease in air density at altitude.  

The idle valve and economizer jet can be combined in one  assembly. The unit is controlled manually by the movement  of the valve assembly. At low airflow positions, the tapered  section of the valve becomes the predominant jet in the  system, controlling the fuel flow for the idle range. As the  valve moves to the cruise position, a straight section on the  valve establishes a fixed orifice effect which controls the  cruise mixture. When the valve is pulled full-open by the  throttle valve, the jet is pulled completely out of the seat, and  the seat side becomes the controlling jet. This jet is calibrated  for takeoff power mixtures.  

An airflow-controlled power enrichment valve can also be  used with this carburetor. It consists of a spring-loaded,  diaphragm-operated metering valve. Refer to  Figure 2-29   for a schematic view of an airflow power enrichment valve.  One side of the diaphragm is exposed to unmetered fuel  pressure and the other side to venturi suction plus spring  tension. When the pressure differential across the diaphragm  establishes a force strong enough to compress the spring, the  valve opens and supplies an additional amount of fuel to the  metered fuel circuit in addition to the fuel supplied by the  main metering jet.

# Accelerating Pump  

The accelerating pump of the Stromberg PS carburetor is a  spring-loaded diaphragm assembly located in the metered  fuel channel with the opposite side of the diaphragm vented  to the engine side of the throttle valve. With this arrangement,  opening the throttle results in a rapid decrease in suction. This  decrease in suction permits the spring to extend and move  the accelerating pump diaphragm. The diaphragm and spring  action displace the fuel in the accelerating pump and force it  out the discharge nozzle.  

Vapor is eliminated from the top of the main fuel chamber  D through a bleed hole, then through a vent line back to the  main fuel tank in the aircraft.  

# Manual Mixture Control  

A manual mixture control provides a means of correcting  for enrichment at altitude. It consists of a needle valve and  seat that form an adjustable bleed between chamber A and  chamber B. The valve can be adjusted to bleed off the venturi  suction to maintain the correct air-fuel ratio as the aircraft  gains altitude.  

When the mixture control lever is moved to the idle cutoff  position, a cam on the linkage actuates a rocker arm which  moves the idle cutoff plunger inward against the release  lever in chamber A. The lever compresses the regulator  diaphragm spring to relieve all tension on the diaphragm  between chambers A and B. This permits fuel pressure plus  poppet valve spring force to close the poppet valve, stopping  the fuel flow. Placing the mixture control lever in idle cutoff  also positions the mixture control needle valve off its seat and  allows metering suction within the carburetor to bleed off.  

# Fuel-Injection Systems  

The fuel-injection system has many advantages over a  conventional carburetor system. There is less danger of  induction system icing, since the drop in temperature due  to fuel vaporization takes place in or near the cylinder.  Acceleration is also improved because of the positive action  of the injection system. In addition, fuel injection improves  fuel distribution. This reduces the overheating of individual  cylinders often caused by variation in mixture due to uneven  distribution. The fuel-injection system also gives better fuel  economy than a system in which the mixture to most cylinders  must be richer than necessary so that the cylinder with the  leanest mixture operates properly.  

Fuel-injection systems vary in their details of construction,  arrangement, and operation. The Bendix and Continental  fuel-injection systems are discussed in this section. They  are described to provide an understanding of the operating  principles involved. For the specific details of any one  system, consult the manufacturer’s instructions for the  equipment involved.  

# Bendix/Precision Fuel-Injection System  

The Bendix inline stem-type regulator injection system  (RSA) series consists of an injector, flow divider, and fuel  discharge nozzle. It is a continuous-flow system which  measures engine air consumption and uses airflow forces to  control fuel flow to the engine. The fuel distribution system  to the individual cylinders is obtained by the use of a fuel  flow divider and air bleed nozzles.  

# Fuel Injector  

The fuel injector assembly consists of:  

1.	 An airflow section, 2.	 A regulator section, and 3.	 A fuel metering section. Some fuel injectors are  equipped with an automatic mixture control unit.  

# Airflow Section  

The airflow consumption of the engine is measured by  sensing impact pressure and venturi throat pressure in the  throttle body. These pressures are vented to the two sides of  an air diaphragm. A cutaway view of the airflow measuring  section is shown in  Figure 2-30 . Movement of the throttle  valve causes a change in engine air consumption. This  results in a change in the air velocity in the venturi. When  airflow through the engine increases, the pressure on the left  of the diaphragm is lowered due to the drop in pressure at  the venturi throat.  [Figure 2-31]  As a result, the diaphragm  moves to the left, opening the ball valve. Contributing to this  force is the impact pressure that is picked up by the impact  tubes.  [Figure 2-32]  This pressure differential is referred  to as the “air metering force.” This force is accomplished  by channeling the impact and venturi suction pressures to  opposite sides of a diaphragm. The difference between these

Figure 2-31.   Airflow section of a fuel injector.  

two pressures becomes a usable force that is equal to the area  of the diaphragm times the pressure difference.  

# Regulator Section  

The regulator section consists of a fuel diaphragm that  opposes the air metering force. Fuel inlet pressure is applied  to one side of the fuel diaphragm and metered fuel pressure  is applied to the other side. The differential pressure across  the fuel diaphragm is called the fuel metering force. The fuel  pressure shown on the ball side of the fuel diaphragm is the  pressure after the fuel has passed through the fuel strainer  and the manual mixture control rotary plate and is referred to  as metered fuel pressure. Fuel inlet pressure is applied to the  

![](images/5d19e2ce3299f00789ab2cf57a5771a319139d2cac9e213f185caad40350da07.jpg)

opposite side of the fuel diaphragm. The ball valve attached  to the fuel diaphragm controls the orifice opening and fuel  flow through the forces placed on it.  [Figure 2-33]  

The distance the ball valve opens is determined by the  difference between the pressures acting on the diaphragms.  This difference in pressure is proportional to the airflow  through the injector. Thus, the volume of airflow determines  the rate of fuel flow.  

Under low power settings, the difference in pressure created  by the venturi is insufficient to accomplish consistent  regulation of the fuel. A constant-head idle spring is

incorporated to provide a constant fuel differential pressure.  This allows an adequate final flow in the idle range.  

# Fuel Metering Section  

The fuel metering section is attached to the air metering  section and contains an inlet fuel strainer, a manual mixture  control valve, an idle valve, and the main metering jet.  [Figure 2-34]  The idle valve is connected to the throttle valve  by means of an external adjustable link. In some injector
 models, a power enrichment jet is also located in this section.  The purpose of the fuel metering section is to meter and  control the fuel flow to the flow divider.  [Figure 2-35]  The  manual mixture control valve produces full rich condition  when the lever is against the rich stop, and a progressively  leaner mixture as the lever is moved toward idle cutoff. Both  idle speed and idle mixture may be adjusted externally to  meet individual engine requirements.  

# Flow Divider  

The metered fuel is delivered from the fuel control unit to a  pressurized flow divider. This unit keeps metered fuel under  pressure, divides fuel to the various cylinders at all engine  speeds, and shuts off the individual nozzle lines when the  control is placed in idle cutoff.  

Referring to the diagram in  Figure 2-36 , metered fuel pressure  enters the flow divider through a channel that permits fuel to  pass through the inside diameter of the flow divider needle.  At idle speed, the fuel pressure from the regulator must build  up to overcome the spring force applied to the diaphragm and  valve assembly. This moves the valve upward until fuel can  pass out through the annulus of the valve to the fuel nozzle.  [Figure 2-37]  Since the regulator meters and delivers a fixed  amount of fuel to the flow divider, the valve opens only as  far as necessary to pass this amount to the nozzles. At idle,  the opening required is very small; the fuel for the individual  cylinders is divided at idle by the flow divider.  

As fuel flow through the regulator is increased above idle  requirements, fuel pressure builds up in the nozzle lines.  This pressure fully opens the flow divider valve, and  fuel distribution to the engine becomes a function of the  discharge nozzles.

Figure 2-38.   Fuel nozzle assembly.  

A fuel pressure gauge, calibrated in pounds per hour fuel  flow, can be used as a fuel flow meter with the Bendix RSA  injection system. This gauge is connected to the flow divider  and senses the pressure being applied to the discharge nozzle.  This pressure is in direct proportion to the fuel flow and  indicates the engine power output and fuel consumption.  

# Fuel Discharge Nozzles  

The fuel discharge nozzles are of the air bleed configuration.  There is one nozzle for each cylinder located in the cylinder  head.  [Figure 2-38]  The nozzle outlet is directed into the  intake port. Each nozzle incorporates a calibrated jet. The  jet size is determined by the available fuel inlet pressure  and the maximum fuel flow required by the engine. The fuel  is discharged through this jet into an ambient air pressure  chamber within the nozzle assembly. Before entering the  individual intake valve chambers, the fuel is mixed with air to  aid in atomizing the fuel. Fuel pressure, before the individual  nozzles, is in direct proportion to fuel flow; therefore, a  simple pressure gauge can be calibrated in fuel flow in gallons  per hour and be employed as a flow meter. Engines modified  with turbosupercharger s must use shrouded nozzles. By the  use of an air manifold, these nozzles are vented to the injector  air inlet pressure.  

# Continental/TCM Fuel-Injection System  

The Continental fuel-injection system injects fuel into the  intake valve port in each cylinder head.  [Figure 2-39]  The  system consists of a fuel injector pump, a control unit, a fuel  manifold, and a fuel discharge nozzle. It is a continuous-flow  type, which controls fuel flow to match engine airflow. The  continuous-flow system permits the use of a rotary vane pump  which does not require timing to the engine.  

# Fuel-Injection Pump  

The fuel pump is a positive-displacement, rotary-vane type with  a splined shaft for connection to the accessory drive system  of the engine.  [Figure 2-40]  A spring-loaded, diaphragm-type  relief valve is provided. The relief valve diaphragm chamber  is vented to atmospheric pressure. A sectional view of a fuel- injection pump is shown in  Figure 2-41 .  

Fuel enters at the swirl well of the vapor separator. Here,  vapor is separated by a swirling motion so that only liquid  fuel is delivered to the pump. The vapor is drawn from the  top center of the swirl well by a small pressure jet of fuel  and is directed into the vapor return line. This line carries  the vapor back to the fuel tank.  

Ignoring the effect of altitude or ambient air conditions,  the use of a positive-displacement, engine-driven pump  means that changes in engine speed affect total pump flow  proportionally. Since the pump provides greater capacity than  is required by the engine, a recirculation path is required. By  arranging a calibrated orifice and relief valve in this path, the  pump delivery pressure is also maintained in proportion to  engine speed. These provisions assure proper pump pressure  and fuel delivery for all engine operating speeds.  

A check valve is provided so that boost pump pressure to the  system can bypass the engine-driven pump for starting. This  feature also suppresses vapor formation under high ambient  temperatures of the fuel and permits use of the auxiliary  pump as a source of fuel pressure in the event of engine- driven pump failure.  

# Air-Fuel Control Unit  

The function of the air-fuel control assembly is to control  engine air intake and to set the metered fuel pressure for  proper air-fuel ratio. The air throttle is mounted at the  manifold inlet and its butterfly valve, positioned by the  throttle control in the aircraft, controls the flow of air to the  engine.  [Figure 2-42]  

![](images/f2cf86f5dfeb45f5f3eb0e3cd2192bab59f8e9028d1ec1dd6223e46ec96ff3ff.jpg)

Figure 2-40.   Fuel pump.  

The air throttle assembly is an aluminum casting which  contains the shaft and butterfly-valve assembly. The casting  bore size is tailored to the engine size, and no venturi or other  restriction is used.  

# Fuel Control Assembly  

The fuel control body is made of bronze for best bearing  action with the stainless steel valves. Its central bore contains  a metering valve at one end and a mixture control valve at  the other end. Each stainless steel rotary valve includes a  groove which forms a fuel chamber.  

Fuel enters the control unit through a strainer and passes to the  metering valve.  [Figure 2-43]  This rotary valve has a cam- shaped edge on the outer part of the end face. The position  of the cam at the fuel delivery port controls the fuel passed  to the manifold valve and the nozzles. The fuel return port  connects to the return passage of the center metering plug.  The alignment of the mixture control valve with this passage  determines the amount of fuel returned to the fuel pump.  

By connecting the metering valve to the air throttle, the fuel  flow is properly proportioned to airflow for the correct air- fuel ratio. A control level is mounted on the mixture control  valve shaft and connected to the flight deck mixture control.  

# Fuel Manifold Valve  

The fuel manifold valve contains a fuel inlet, a diaphragm  chamber, and outlet ports for the lines to the individual  nozzles.  [Figure 2-44]  The spring-loaded diaphragm operates  a valve in the central bore of the body. Fuel pressure provides  the force for moving the diaphragm. The diaphragm is  enclosed by a cover that retains the diaphragm loading spring.  When the valve is down against the lapped seat in the body,  the fuel lines to the cylinders are closed off. The valve is  drilled for passage of fuel from the diaphragm chamber to  its base, and a ball valve is installed within the valve. All  incoming fuel must pass through a fine screen installed in  the diaphragm chamber.  

![](images/1c382bfff0687325db2e54f828efc28d01e5e13d1a07bf2edb585ca64e600229.jpg)

Figure 2-42.   Fuel air control unit.  

From the fuel-injection control valve, fuel is delivered to  the fuel manifold valve, which provides a central point for  dividing fuel flow to the individual cylinders. In the fuel  manifold valve, a diaphragm raises or lowers a plunger  valve to open or close the individual cylinder fuel supply  ports simultaneously.  

# Fuel Discharge Nozzle  

The fuel discharge nozzle is located in the cylinder head  with its outlet directed into the intake port. The nozzle body  contains a drilled central passage with a counterbore at each  end.  [Figure 2-45]  The lower end is used as a chamber for  air-fuel mixing before the spray leaves the nozzle. The upper  bore contains a removable orifice for calibrating the nozzles.  Nozzles are calibrated in several ranges, and all nozzles  furnished for one engine are of the same range and are  identified by a letter stamped on the hex of the nozzle body.  

Drilled radial holes connect the upper counterbore with the  outside of the nozzle body. These holes enter the counterbore  above the orifice and draw air through a cylindrical screen  fitted over the nozzle body. A shield is press-fitted on the  nozzle body and extends over the greater part of the filter  screen, leaving an opening near the bottom. This provides  both mechanical protection and an abrupt change in the  direction of airflow which keeps dirt and foreign material  out of the nozzle interior.  

# Carburetor Maintenance  

# Carburetor Removal  

The removal procedures vary with both the type of  carburetor concerned and the type of engine on which it  is used. Always refer to the applicable manufacturer’s  technical instructions for a particular installation. Generally,  the procedures are much the same, regardless of the type  of carburetor concerned.  

Before removing a carburetor, make sure the fuel shutoff (or  selector) valve is closed. Disconnect the throttle and mixture  control linkages, and lockwire the throttle valve in the closed  position. Disconnect the fuel inlet line and all vapor return,  gauge, and primer lines. If the same carburetor is to be re- installed, do not alter the rigging of the throttle and mixture  controls. Remove the airscoop or airscoop adapter. Remove

the air screens and gaskets from the carburetor. Remove  the nuts and washers securing the carburetor to the engine.  When removing a downdraft carburetor, use extreme care  to ensure that nothing is dropped into the engine. Remove  the carburetor. Immediately install a protective cover on the  carburetor mounting flange of the engine to prevent small  parts or foreign material from falling into the engine. When  there is danger of foreign material entering open fuel lines  during removal or installation of the carburetor, plug them  using the proper cover fittings.  

# Installation of Carburetor  

Check the carburetor for proper lockwiring before installation  on an engine. Be sure that all shipping plugs have been  removed from the carburetor openings.  

Remove the protective cover from the carburetor mounting  flange on the engine. Place the carburetor mounting flange  gasket in position. On some engines, bleed passages are  incorporated in the mounting pad. The gasket must be  installed so that the bleed hole in the gasket is aligned with  the passage in the mounting flange.  

Inspect the induction passages for the presence of any  foreign material before installing the carburetor. As soon  as the carburetor is placed in position on the engine, close  and lockwire the throttle valves in the closed position until  the remainder of the installation is completed. Place the  carburetor deck screen, when feasible, in position to further  eliminate the possibility of foreign objects entering the  induction system.  

When installing a carburetor that uses diaphragms for  controlling fuel flow, connect the fuel lines and fill the  carburetor with fuel. To do this, turn on the fuel boost pump  and move the mixture control from the idle cutoff position  to rich position. Continue the flow until oil-free fuel flows  from the drain valve. This indicates that the preservative oil  has been flushed from the carburetor. Turn off the fuel flow,  plug the fuel inlet and vapor vent outlet, and then allow  the carburetor, filled with fuel, to stand for a minimum of  8 hours. This is necessary in order to soak the diaphragms  and render them pliable to the same degree as when the unit  was originally calibrated. Tighten the carburetor mounting  bolts to the value specified in the table of torque limits in the  applicable maintenance manual. Tighten and safety any other  nuts and bolts incidental to the installation of the carburetor  before connecting the throttle and mixture-control levers.  After the carburetor has been bolted to the engine, check the  throttle and mixture-control lever on the unit for freedom of  movement before connecting the control cables or linkage.  Check the vapor vent lines or return lines from the carburetor  to the aircraft fuel tank for restriction.  

# Rigging Carburetor Controls  

Connect and adjust carburetor or fuel metering equipment  throttle controls so that full movement of the throttle is  obtained from corresponding full movement of the control  in the flight deck. In addition, check and adjust the throttle  control linkages so that springback on the throttle quadrant  in the aircraft is equal in both the full-open and full-closed  positions. Correct any excess play or looseness of control  linkage or cables. Controls should be checked so that they  go stop-to-stop on the carburetor. Check for complete and  full travel of each control.  

When installing carburetors or fuel metering equipment  incorporating manual-type mixture controls that do not have  marked positions, adjust the mixture control mechanism to  provide an equal amount of springback at both the rich and  lean ends of the control quadrant in the flight deck when  the mixture control on the carburetor or fuel metering  equipment is moved through the full range. Where mixture  controls with detents are used, rig the control mechanism  so that the designated positions on the control quadrant in  the aircraft agree with the corresponding positions on the  carburetor or fuel metering equipment. Controls should  move freely and smoothly without binding throughout  their total travel. In all cases, check the controls for proper  positioning in both the advance and retard positions. Correct  excess play or looseness of control linkage or cables. Safety  all controls properly to eliminate the possibility of loosening  from vibration during operation.  

# Adjusting Idle Mixtures  

Excessively rich or lean idle mixtures result in incomplete  combustion within the engine cylinder, with resultant  formation of carbon deposits on the spark plugs and  subsequent spark plug fouling. In addition, excessively rich  or lean idle mixtures make it necessary to taxi at high idle  speeds with resultant fast taxi speeds and excessive brake  wear. Each engine must have the carburetor idle mixture  tailored for the particular engine and installation if best  operation is to be obtained.  

Engines that are properly adjusted, insofar as valve operation,  cylinder compression, ignition, and carburetor idle mixture  are concerned, idle at the prescribed rpm for indefinite periods  without loading up, overheating, or spark plug fouling. If an  engine does not respond to idle mixture adjustment with the  resultant stable idling characteristics previously outlined,  some other phase of engine operation is not correct. In such  cases, determine and correct the cause of the difficulty. A  general guide to check and adjust the idle mixture and speed  on many types of reciprocating engine is discussed in the  following paragraphs. Always refer to the appropriate manual  Before checking the idle mixture on any engine, warm  up the engine until oil and cylinder head temperatures are  normal. Keep the propeller control in the increase rpm setting  throughout the entire process of warming up the engine.  Always make idle mixture adjustments with cylinder head  temperatures at normal values. The idle mixture adjustment is  made on the idle mixture fuel control valve.  [Figure 2-46]  It  should not be confused with the adjustment of the idle speed  stop. The importance of idle mixture adjustment cannot be  overstressed. Optimum engine operation at low speeds can be  obtained only when proper air-fuel mixtures are delivered to  every cylinder of the engine. Excessively rich idle mixtures  and the resultant incomplete combustion are responsible  for more spark plug fouling than any other single cause.  Excessively lean idle mixtures result in faulty acceleration.  Furthermore, the idle mixture adjustment affects the air-fuel  mixture and engine operation well up into the cruise range.  

On an engine with a conventional carburetor, the idle mixture  is checked by manually leaning the mixture with the flight  deck mixture control. Move the carburetor mixture control  slowly and smoothly toward the idle cutoff position. On  installations that do not use a manifold pressure gauge, it is  necessary to observe the tachometer for an indication of a  rpm change. With most installations, the idle mixture should  be adjusted to provide an rpm rise prior to decreasing as the  engine ceases to fire. This rpm increase varies from 10 to 50  rpm, depending on the installation. Following the momentary  increase in rpm, the engine speed starts to drop. Immediately  move the mixture control back to rich to prevent the engine  from stopping completely.  

On RSA fuel-injection engines, the optimum idle setting is  one that is rich enough to provide a satisfactory acceleration  under all conditions and lean enough to prevent spark plug  

![](images/0aa545115a0ca65d38d3587e2b807328a69789c2aab9b273aec615832410b057.jpg)  
Figure 2-46.   Idle mixture adjustment for carburetor.  

fouling or rough operation. A rise of  $25{-}50\,\mathrm{rpm}$   as the mixture  control is moved to the idle cutoff position usually satisfies  both of these conditions. The actual idle mixture adjustment is  made by the lengthening or shortening of the linkage between  the throttle lever and the idle lever.  [Figure 2-47]  

If the check of the idle mixture reveals it to be too lean or too  rich, increase or decrease the idle fuel flow as required. Then,  repeat the check. Continue checking and adjusting the idle  mixture until it checks out properly. During this process, it  may be desirable to move the idle speed stop completely out  of the way and to hold the engine speed at the desired rpm by  means of the throttle. This eliminates the need for frequent  readjustments of the idle stop as the idle mixture is improved  and the idle speed picks up. After each adjustment, clear the  engine by briefly running it at higher rpm. This prevents  fouling of the plugs which might otherwise be caused by  incorrect idle mixture. After adjusting the idle mixture,  recheck it several times to determine definitively that the  mixture is correct and remains constant on repeated changes  from high power back to idle. Correct any inconsistency in  engine idling before releasing the aircraft for service.  

Setting the idle mixture on the continental TCM fuel injection  system consists of a conventional spring loaded screw located  in the air throttle lever.  [Figure 2-48]  The fuel pump pressure  is part of the basic calibration and requires servicing to make  sure the pump pressure are set correctly before making idle  adjustments. The idle mixture adjustment is the locknut at  the metering valve end of the linkage between the metering  valve and the air throttle levers. Tightening the nut to shorten  the linkage provides a richer mixture. A leaner mixture is  obtained by backing off the nut to lengthen the linkage.  Adjust to obtain a slight and momentary gain in idle speed  as the mixture control is slowly moved toward idle cut off.  If the idle mixture is set too lean, the idle speed drops with  no gain in speed.  

# Idle Speed Adjustment  

After adjusting the idle mixture, reset the idle stop to the  idle rpm specified in the aircraft maintenance manual. The  engine must be warmed up thoroughly and checked for  ignition system malfunctioning. Throughout any carburetor  adjustment procedure, periodically run the engine up to  approximately half of normal rated speed to clear the engine.  

Some carburetors are equipped with an eccentric screw to  adjust idle rpm. Others use a spring-loaded screw to limit  the throttle valve closing. In either case, adjust the screw  as required to increase or decrease rpm with the throttle  retarded against the stop. Open the throttle to clear the engine;  close the throttle and allow the rpm to stabilize. Repeat this  operation until the desired idling speed is obtained.

# Fuel System Inspection & Maintenance  

The inspection of a fuel system installation consists basically  of an examination of the system for conformity to design  requirements together with functional tests to prove correct  operation. Since there are considerable variations in the fuel  systems used on different aircraft, no attempt has been made

to describe any particular system in detail. It is important that  the manufacturer’s instructions for the aircraft concerned  be followed when performing inspection or maintenance  functions.  

# Complete System  

Inspect the entire system for wear, damage, or leaks. Make  sure that all units are securely attached and properly safetied.  The drain plugs or valves in the fuel system should be opened  to check for the presence of sediment or water. The filter and  sump should also be checked for sediment, water, or slime.  The filters or screens, including those provided for flow  meters and auxiliary pumps, must be clean and free from  corrosion. The controls should be checked for freedom of  movement, security of locking, and freedom from damage  due to chafing. The fuel vents should be checked for correct  positioning and freedom from obstruction; otherwise, fuel  flow or pressure fueling may be affected. Filler neck drains  should be checked for freedom from obstruction.  

If booster pumps are installed, the system should be checked  for leaks by operating the pumps. During this check, the  ammeter or load meter should be read and the readings of  all the pumps, where applicable, should be approximately  the same.  

# Fuel Tanks  

All applicable panels in the aircraft skin or structure should  be removed and the tanks inspected for corrosion on the  external surfaces, for security of attachment, and for correct  adjustment of straps and slings. Check the fittings and  connections for leaks or failures.  

Some fuel tanks manufactured of light alloy materials are  provided with inhibitor cartridges to reduce the corrosive  effects of combined leaded fuel and water. Where  applicable, the cartridge should be inspected and renewed  at the specified periods.  

# Lines & Fittings  

Be sure that the lines are properly supported and that the nuts  and clamps are securely tightened. To tighten hose clamps  to the proper torque, use a hose-clamp torque wrench. If  this wrench is not available, tighten the clamp finger-tight  plus the number of turns specified for the hose and clamp.  If the clamps do not seal at the specified torque, replace the  clamps, the hose, or both. After installing a new hose, check  the clamps daily and tighten if necessary. When this daily  check indicates that cold flow has ceased, inspect the clamps  at less frequent intervals.  

Replace the hose if the plys have separated, if there is  excessive cold flow, or if the hose is hard and inflexible.  Permanent impressions from the clamp and cracks in the tube  or cover stock indicate excessive cold flow. Replace any hose  that has collapsed at the bends or as a result of misaligned  fittings or lines. Some hoses tend to flare at the ends beyond  the clamps. This is not an unsatisfactory condition unless  leakage is present.  

Blisters may form on the outer synthetic rubber cover of the  hose. These blisters do not necessarily affect the serviceability  of the hose. When a blister is discovered on a hose, remove  the hose from the aircraft and puncture the blister with a  pin. The blister should then collapse. If fluid (oil, fuel, or  hydraulic) emerges from the pinhole in the blister, reject the  hose. If only air emerges, then test the hose pressure at   $1\%$  times the working pressure. If no fluid leakage occurs, the  hose can be regarded as serviceable.  

Puncturing the outer cover of the hose may permit the entry  of corrosive elements, such as water, which could attack  the wire braiding and ultimately result in failure. For this  reason, puncturing the outer covering of hoses exposed to  the elements should be avoided.  

The external surface of hose may develop fine cracks, usually  short in length, which are caused by surface aging. The hose  assembly may be regarded as serviceable, provided these  cracks do not penetrate to the first braid.  

# Selector Valves  

Rotate selector valves and check for free operation, excessive  backlash, and accurate pointer indication. If the backlash  is excessive, check the entire operating mechanism for  worn joints, loose pins, and broken drive lugs. Replace any  defective parts. Inspect cable control systems for worn or  frayed cables, damaged pulleys, or worn pulley bearings.  

# Pumps  

During an inspection of booster pumps, check for the  following conditions:  

1.	 Proper operation; 2.	 Leaks and condition of fuel and electrical connections;  and 3.	 Wear of motor brushes.  

Be sure the drain lines are free of traps, bends, or restrictions.  Check the engine-driven pump for leaks and security of  mounting. Check the vent and drain lines for obstructions.  

# Main Line Strainers  

Drain water and sediment from the main line strainer at  each preflight inspection. Remove and clean the screen at  the periods specified in the airplane maintenance manual.  Examine the sediment removed from the housing. Particles of  rubber are often early warnings of hose deterioration. Check  for leaks and damaged gaskets.  

# Fuel Quantity Gauges  

If a sight gauge is used, be sure that the glass is clear and that  there are no leaks at the connections. Check the lines leading to  it for leaks and security of attachment. Check the mechanical  gauges for free movement of the float arm and for proper  synchronization of the pointer with the position of the float.  

On the electrical and electronic gauges, be sure that both the  indicator and the tank units are securely mounted and that  their electrical connections are tight.  

# Fuel Pressure Gauge  

Check the pointer for zero tolerance and excessive oscillation.  Check the cover glass for looseness and for proper range  markings. Check the lines and connections for leaks. Be sure  that there is no obstruction in the vent. Replace the instrument  if it is defective.  

# Pressure Warning Signal  

Inspect the entire installation for security of mounting  and condition of the electrical, fuel, and air connections.  

Check the lamp by pressing the test switch to see that it  lights. Check the operation by turning the battery switch on,  building up pressure with the booster pump, and observing  the pressure at which the light goes out. If necessary, adjust  the contact mechanism.  

# Water Injection Systems for Reciprocating Engines  

These systems have very limited use in modern aircraft  engines. Water injection was used mostly on large radial  engines. The water injection system enabled more power to  be obtained from the engine at takeoff than is possible without  water injection. The carburetor (operating at high power  settings) delivers more fuel to the engine than it actually  needs. A leaner mixture would produce more power; however,  the additional fuel is necessary to prevent overheating and  detonation. With the injection of the antidetonant fluid, the  mixture can be leaned out to that which produces maximum  power, and the vaporization of the water-alcohol mixture then  provides the cooling formerly supplied by the excess fuel.  

# Turbine Engine Fuel System—General  Requirements  

The fuel system is one of the more complex aspects of the gas  turbine engine. It must be possible to increase or decrease the  power at will to obtain the thrust required for any operating  condition. In turbine-powered aircraft, this control is provided  by varying the flow of fuel to the combustion chambers.  However, some turboprop aircraft also use variable-pitch  propellers; thus, the selection of thrust is shared by two  controllable variables, fuel flow and propeller blade angle.  

The quantity of fuel supplied must be adjusted automatically  to correct for changes in ambient temperature or pressure.  If the quantity of fuel becomes excessive in relation to mass  airflow through the engine, the limiting temperature of the  turbine blades can be exceeded, or it will produce compressor  stall and a condition referred to as rich blowout. Rich blowout  occurs when the amount of oxygen in the air supply is  insufficient to support combustion and when the mixture is  cooled below the combustion temperature by the excess fuel.  The other extreme, lean flameout, occurs if the fuel quantity  is reduced proportionally below the air quantity. The engine  must operate through acceleration and deceleration without  any fuel-control-related problems.  

The fuel system must deliver fuel to the combustion chambers  not only in the right quantity, but also in the right condition  for satisfactory combustion. The fuel nozzles form part of  the fuel system and atomize or vaporize the fuel so that  it ignites and burns efficiently. The fuel system must also  supply fuel so that the engine can be easily started on the  ground and in the air. This means that the fuel must be  injected into the combustion chambers in a combustible  condition during engine starting, and that combustion must  be sustained while the engine is accelerating to its normal  idling speed. Another critical condition to which the fuel  system must respond occurs during a rapid acceleration.  When the engine is accelerated, energy must be furnished to  the turbine in excess of that necessary to maintain a constant  rpm. However, if the fuel flow increases too rapidly, an over  rich mixture can be produced, with the possibility of a rich  blowout or compressor stall.  

Turbofan, turbojet, turboshaft, and turboprop engines are  equipped with a fuel control unit which automatically  satisfies the requirements of the engine. Although the basic  requirements apply generally to all gas turbine engines, the  way in which individual fuel controls meet these needs cannot  be conveniently generalized.  

# Turbine Fuel Controls  

Gas turbine engine fuel controls can be divided into three  basic groups:  

1.	 Hydromechanical, 2.	 Hydromechanical/electronic, and 3.	 Full Authority Digital Engine (or Electronics) Control  (FADEC).  

The hydromechanical/electronic fuel control is a hybrid  of the two types of fuel control but can function solely  as a hydromechanical control. In the dual mode, inputs  and outputs are electronic, and fuel flow is set by servo  motors. The third type, FADEC, uses electronic sensors for  its inputs and controls fuel flow with electronic outputs.  The FADEC-type control gives the electronic controller  (computer) complete control. The computing section of the  FADEC system depends completely on sensor inputs to the  electronic engine control (EEC) to meter the fuel flow. The  fuel metering device meters the fuel using only outputs from  the EEC. Most turbine fuel controls are quickly going to the  FADEC type of control. This electronically controlled fuel  control is very accurate in scheduling fuel by sensing many  of the engine parameters.  

Regardless of the type, all fuel controls accomplish essentially  the same function. That function is to schedule the fuel flow  to match the power required by the pilot. Some sense more  engine variables than others. The fuel control can sense many  different inputs, such as power lever position, engine rpm for  each spool, compressor inlet pressure and temperature, burner  pressure, compressor discharge pressure, and many more  parameters as needed by the specific engine. These variables  affect the amount of thrust that an engine produces for a given  fuel flow. By sensing these parameters, the fuel control has  a clear picture of what is happening in the engine and can  adjust fuel flow as needed. Each type of turbine engine has  its own specific needs for fuel delivery and control.  

# Hydromechanical Fuel Control  

Hydromechanical fuel controls were used and are still used  on many engines, but their use is becoming limited giving  way to electronic based controls. Fuel controls have two  sections, computing and metering, to provide the correct fuel  flow for the engine. A pure hydromechanical fuel control has  no electronic interface assisting in computing or metering the  fuel flow. It also is generally driven by the gas generator gear  train of the engine to sense engine speed. Other mechanical  engine parameters that are sensed are compressor discharge  pressure, burner pressure, exhaust temperature, and inlet  air temperature and pressure. Once the computing section  determines the correct amount of fuel flow, the metering  section through cams and servo valves delivers the fuel to  the engine fuel system. Actual operating procedures for a  hydromechanical fuel control is very complicated and still  the fuel metering is not as accurate as with an electronic  type of interface or control. Electronic controls can receive  more inputs with greater accuracy than hydromechanical  controls. Early electronic controls used a hydromechanical  control with an electronic system added on the system to fine  tune the metering of the fuel. This arrangement also used the  hydromechanical system as a backup if the electronic system  failed.  [Figure 2-49]  

# Hydromechanical/Electronic Fuel Control  

The addition of the electronic control to the basic  hydromechanical fuel control was the next step in the  development of turbine engine fuel controls. Generally, this  type of system used a remotely located EEC to adjust the  fuel flow. A description of a typical system is explained in  the following information. The basic function of the engine  fuel system is to pressurize the fuel, meter fuel flow, and  deliver atomized fuel to the combustion section of the engine.  Fuel flow is controlled by a hydromechanical fuel control  assembly, which contains a fuel shutoff section and a fuel  metering section.  

This fuel control unit is sometimes mounted on the vane  fuel pump assembly. It provides the power lever connection  and the fuel shutoff function. The unit provides mechanical  overspeed protection for the gas generator spool during  normal (automatic mode) engine operation. In automatic  mode, the EEC is in control of metering the fuel. In manual  mode, the hydromechanical control takes over.  

During normal engine operation, a remotely mounted  electronic fuel control unit (EFCU) (same as an EEC)  performs the functions of thrust setting, speed governing and  acceleration, and deceleration limiting through EFCU outputs  to the fuel control assembly in response to power lever inputs.  In the event of electrical or EFCU failure, or at the option of  the pilot, the fuel control assembly functions in manual mode  to allow engine operation at reduced power under control of  the hydromechanical portion of the controller only.  

The total engine fuel and control system consists of the  following components and provides the functions as  indicated:  

1.	 The vane fuel pump assembly is a fixed displacement  fuel pump that provides high pressure fuel to the  engine fuel control system.  [Figure 2-50]  

2.	 The filter bypass valve in the fuel pump allows fuel to  bypass the fuel filter when the pressure drop across the  fuel filter is excessive. An integral differential pressure  indicator visually flags an excessive differential  pressure condition before bypassing occurs, by  extending a pin from the fuel filter bowl. Fuel pump  discharge flow in excess of that required by the fuel  control assembly is returned from the control to the  pump interstage.  

3.	 The hydromechanical fuel control assembly provides  the fuel metering function of the EFCU.  

Fuel is supplied to the fuel control through a  200-micron inlet filter screen and is metered to the  engine by the servo-operated metering valve. It is  a fuel flow/compressor discharge pressure (Wf/ P3) ratio device that positions the metering valve in  response to engine compressor discharge pressure  (P3). Fuel pressure differential across the servo  valve is maintained by the servo-operated bypass  valve in response to commands from the EFCU.  [Figure 2-49]  The manual mode solenoid valve is  energized in the automatic mode. The automatic mode  restricts operation of the mechanical speed governor.  It is restricted to a single overspeed governor setting  above the speed range controlled electronically.  Deenergizing the manual mode valve enables the  mechanical speed governor to function as an all speed  governor in response to power lever angle (PLA). The  fuel control system includes a low power sensitive  torque motor which may be activated to increase or  decrease fuel flow in the automatic mode (EFCU  mode). The torque motor provides an interface to an  electronic control unit that senses various engine and  ambient parameters and activates the torque motor  to meter fuel flow accordingly. This torque motor  provides electromechanical conversion of an electrical  signal from the EFCU. The torque motor current is  zero in the manual mode, which establishes a fixed  Wf/P3 ratio.

Figure 2-50.   Fuel pump and filter.  

This fixed Wf/P3 ratio is such that the engine operates  surge free and is capable of producing a minimum of  90 percent thrust up to 30,000 feet for this example  system. All speed governing of the high-pressure spool  (gas generator) is achieved by the flyweight governor.  The flyweight governor modulates a pneumatic servo,  consistent with the speed set point as determined by  the power lever angle (PLA) setting. The pneumatic  

servo accomplishes Wf/P3 ratio modulation to govern  the gas generator speed by bleeding down the P3  acting on the metering valve servo. The P3 limiter  valve bleeds down the P3 pressure acting in the  metering valve servo when engine structural limits  are encountered in either control mode. The start  fuel enrichment solenoid valve provides additional  fuel flow in parallel with the metering valve when  required for engine cold starting or altitude restarts.  The valve is energized by the EFCU when enrichment  is required. It is always deenergized in the manual  mode to prevent high altitude sub-idle operation.  Located downstream of the metering valve are the  manual shutoff and pressurizing valves. The shutoff  valve is a rotary unit connected to the power lever. It  allows the pilot to direct fuel to the engine manually.  The pressurizing valve acts as a discharge restrictor to  the hydromechanical control. It functions to maintain  minimum operating pressures throughout the control.  The pressurizing valve also provides a positive leak- tight fuel shutoff to the engine fuel nozzles when the  manual valve is closed.  

4.	 The flow divider and drain valve assembly proportions  fuel to the engine primary and secondary fuel  nozzles. It drains the nozzles and manifolds at engine  shutdown. It also incorporates an integral solenoid for  modifying the fuel flow for cold-starting conditions.  

During an engine start, the flow divider directs all  flow through the primary nozzles. After start, as the  engine fuel demand increases, the flow divider valve  opens to allow the secondary nozzles to function.  During all steady-state engine operation, both primary  and secondary nozzles are flowing fuel. A 74-micron,  self-bypassing screen is located under the fuel inlet  fitting and provides last chance filtration of the fuel  prior to the fuel nozzles.  

5.	 The fuel manifold assembly is a matched set consisting  of both primary and secondary manifolds and the fuel  nozzle assemblies.  

Twelve fuel nozzles direct primary and secondary fuel  through the nozzles causing the fuel to swirl and form a finely  atomized spray. The manifold assembly provides fuel routing  and atomizing to ensure proper combustion.  

The EEC system consists of the hydromechanical fuel  control, EFCU, and aircraft mounted power lever angle  potentiometer. Aircraft-generated control signals include inlet  pressure, airstream differential pressure, and inlet temperature  plus pilot selection of either manual or auto mode for the  EFCU operation. Engine-generated control signals include  fan spool speed, gas generator spool speed, inner turbine  temperature, fan discharge temperature, and compressor  discharge pressure. Aircraft- and engine-generated control  signals are directed to the EFCU where these signals are  interpreted. The PLA potentiometer is mounted in the throttle  quadrant. The PLA potentiometer transmits an electrical  signal to the EFCU, which represents engine thrust demand  in relation to throttle position. If the EFCU determines a  power change is required, it commands the torque motor  to modulate differential pressure at the head sensor. This  change in differential pressure causes the metering valve  to move, varying fuel flow to the engine as required. The  EFCU receives electrical signals which represent engine  operating variables. It also receives a pilot-initiated signal  (by power-lever position) representing engine thrust demand.  The EFCU computes electrical output signals for use by the  engine fuel control for scheduling engine operation within  predetermined limits. The EFCU is programmed to recognize  predetermined engine operating limits and to compute output  signals such that these operating limits are not exceeded.  The EFCU is remotely located and airframe mounted. An  interface between the EFCU and aircraft/engine is provided  through the branched wiring harness assembly.  [Figure 2-51]  

# FADEC Fuel Control Systems  

A full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) has been  developed to control fuel flow on most new turbine engine  models. A true FADEC system has no hydromechanical fuel  control backup system. The system uses electronic sensors  that feed engine parameter information into the EEC. The  EEC gathers the needed information to determine the amount  of fuel flow and transmits it to a fuel metering valve. The  fuel metering valve simply reacts to the commands from the  EEC. The EEC is a computer that is the computing section  of the fuel delivery system and the metering valve meters  the fuel flow. FADEC systems are used on many types of  turbine engines from APUs to the largest propulsion engines.  

# FADEC for an Auxiliary Power Unit  

An APU engine uses the aircraft fuel system to supply fuel  to the fuel control. An electric boost pump may be used to  supply fuel under pressure to the control. The fuel usually  passes through an aircraft shutoff valve that is tied to the  fire detecting/extinguishing system. An aircraft furnished  inline fuel filter may also be used. Fuel entering the fuel  control unit first passes through a 10-micron filter. If the filter  becomes contaminated, the resulting pressure drop opens the  filter bypass valve and unfiltered fuel then is supplied to the  APU. Shown in  Figure 2-52  is a pump with an inlet pressure  access plug so that a fuel pressure gauge might be installed  for troubleshooting purposes. Fuel then enters a positive  displacement, gear-type pump. Upon discharge from the  pump, the fuel passes through a 70-micron screen. The screen  is installed at this point to filter any wear debris that might  be discharged from the pump element. From the screen, fuel  branches to the metering valve, differential pressure valve,  and the ultimate relief valve. Also shown at this point is a  pump discharge pressure access plug, another point where a  pressure gauge might be installed.  

The differential pressure valve maintains a constant pressure  drop across the metering valve by bypassing fuel to the pump  inlet so that metered flow is proportional to metering valve  area. The metering valve area is modulated by the torque  motor, which receives variable current from the engine  control unit (ECU). The ultimate relief valve opens to bypass  excess fuel back to the pump inlet whenever system pressure  exceeds a predetermined pressure. This occurs during each  shutdown since all flow is stopped by the shutoff valve and  the differential pressure valve, is unable to bypass full pump  capacity. Fuel flows from the metering valve out of the fuel  control unit (FCU), through the solenoid shutoff valve and  on to the atomizer. Initial flow is through the primary nozzle  tip only. The flow divider opens at higher pressure and adds  flow through the secondary path.  

# FADEC Fuel Control Propulsion Engine  

Many large high-bypass turbofan engines use the FADEC  type of fuel control system. The EEC is the primary  component of the FADEC engine fuel control system. The  

![](images/749586388c6c2f8c1cc4292154688bef7e1cd91d544774bbf8fa448c683075ff.jpg)  
Figure 2-51.   Engine control system.  

EEC is a computer that controls the operation of the engine.  The EEC housing contains two electronic channels (two  separate computers) that are physically separated internally  and is naturally cooled by convection. The EEC is generally  placed in an area of the engine nacelle that is cool during  engine operation. It attaches to the lower-left fan case with  shock mounts.  [Figure 2-53]  

The EEC computer uses data it receives from many engine  sensors and airplane systems to control the engine operation.  It receives electronic signals from the flight deck to set engine  power or thrust. The throttle lever angle resolver supplies the

Figure 2-53.   EEC and programming plug.  

EEC with a signal in proportion to the thrust lever position.  The EEC controls most engine components and receives  feedback from them. Many components supply the EEC with  data for engine operation.  

Power for the EEC comes from the aircraft electrical system  or the permanent magnet alternator (PMA). When the engine  is running, the PMA supplies power to the EEC directly. The  EEC is a two channel computer that controls every aspect  of engine operation. Each channel, which is an independent  computer, can completely control the operation of the engine.  The processor does all of the control calculations and supplies  all the data for the control signals for the torque motors and  solenoids. The cross-talk logic compares data from channels  A and B and uses the cross-talk logic to find which EEC  channel is the best to control the output driver for a torque  motor or solenoid bank. The primary channel controls all of  the output drivers. If the cross-talk logic finds that the other  channel is better for control of a specific bank, the EEC  changes control of that one bank to the other channel. The  EEC has output driver banks that supply the control signals  to engine components. Each channel of the EEC supplies  the driver banks with control signals. The EEC has both  volatile and nonvolatile memory to store performance and  maintenance data.  

The EEC can control the engine thrust in two modes, which  can be selected by use of a mode selection switch. In the  normal mode, engine thrust is set with engine pressure ratio  (EPR); in the alternate mode, thrust is set by N1. When the  fuel control switch is moved from run to cutoff, the EEC  resets. During this reset, all fault data is recorded in the  nonvolatile memory. The EEC controls the metering valve  in the fuel metering unit to supply fuel flow for combustion.  [Figure 2-54]  The fuel metering unit is mounted on the  front face of the gearbox and is attached to the front of  the fuel pump.  [Figure 2-55]  The EEC also sends a signal  to the minimum pressure and shutoff valve in the fuel  metering unit to start or stop fuel flow. The EEC receives  position feedback for several engine components by using  

![](images/7c8336128e68e4aa1948620e3c6849c57163df7b28212b35d63b52ed78b18639.jpg)

rotary differential transformer, linear variable differential  transformer, and thermocouples. These sensors feed engine  parameter information from several systems back to the  EEC. The fuel control run cutoff switch controls the   high  pressure fuel shut off valve that allows or cuts off fuel flow.  The fuel temperature sensor thermocouple attaches to the  fuel outlet line on the rear of the fuel/oil cooler and sends  this information to the EEC. The EEC uses a torque motor  driver to control the position of the metering valve in the fuel  metering unit. The EEC uses solenoid drivers to control the  other functions of the fuel metering unit (FMU). The EEC  also controls several other subsystems of the engine, as  shown in  Figure 2-56 , through torque motors and solenoids,  such as fuel and air oil coolers, bleed valves, variable stator  vanes, turbine cooling air valves, and the turbine case cooling  system.

Figure 2-55.   Fuel pump.  

Each channel of the EEC has seven electrical connections,  three on each side and one on the bottom. Both channels  share the inputs of the two connections on the top of the  EEC. These are the programming plug and test connector.  The programming plug selects the proper software in the  EEC for the thrust rating of the engine. The plug attaches  to the engine fan case with a lanyard. When removing the  EEC, the plug remains with the engine. Each channel of the  EEC has three pneumatic connections on the bottom of the  EEC. Transducers inside the EEC supply the related and  opposite EEC channel with a signal in proportion to the  pressure. The pressures that are read by the EEC are ambient  pressure, burner pressure, low pressure compressor (LPC)  exit pressure, and fan inlet pressure. Each channel has its own  wire color that connects the EEC to its sensors. Channel A  wiring is blue and channel B sensor signals are green. The  non-EEC circuit wire is gray while the thermocouple signals  are yellow. This color coding helps simplify which sensors  are used with each channel.

# Fuel System Operation  

The fuel pump receives fuel from the airplane fuel system.  The low pressure boost stage of the pump pressurizes the fuel  and sends it to the fuel/oil cooler (FOC). The fuel flows from  the FOC, through the fuel pump filter element, and then to  the high pressure main stage of the pump. The high pressure  main stage increases the fuel pressure and sends it to the fuel  metering unit (FMU). It also supplies servo fuel to the servo  fuel heater and engine components. Fuel for combustion  (metered fuel) goes through the fuel flow transmitter to  the distribution valve.  [Figure 2-57]  The fuel distribution  valve supplies metered fuel to the fuel supply manifolds.  [Figure 2-58]  The fuel injectors get the metered fuel from the  fuel supply manifolds and spray the fuel into the engine for  combustion.  [Figure 2-59]  The fuel pump housing contains  a disposable fuel filter element. The fuel filter differential  pressure switch supplies a signal to the EEC that indicates  an almost clogged filter condition. Unfiltered fuel can then  bypass the filter element if the element becomes clogged.  

# Water Injection System  

On warm days, thrust is reduced because of the decrease in  air density. This can be compensated for by injecting water  at the compressor inlet or diffuser case. This lowers the air  temperature and increases air density. A microswitch in the  fuel control is actuated by the control shaft when the power  lever is moved toward the maximum power position.  

A water injection speed reset servo resets the speed adjustment  to a higher value during water injection. Without this  adjustment, the fuel control would decrease rpm so that no  additional thrust would be realized during water injection. The  servo is a shuttle valve that is acted upon by water pressure  during water injection. Movement of the servo displaces a  lever on the cam-operated lever linkage to the speed governor  speeder spring, increasing the force of the speeder spring  and increasing the set speed. Because the resulting rpm is  usually higher while water is flowing, increased thrust during  water injection is ensured. If the water injection system is  not armed in the flight deck or if there is no water available,  nothing happens when the water injection switch in the fuel  control unit is actuated. When water is available, a portion of  it is directed to the water injection speed re-set servo. Water  injection systems are not normally used on high-bypass  turbofan engines.  

# Fuel Control Maintenance  

The field repair of the turbine engine fuel control is very  limited. The only repairs permitted in the field are the  replacement of the control and adjustments afterwards. These  adjustments are limited to the idle rpm and the maximum  speed adjustment, commonly called trimming the engine.  Both adjustments are made in the normal range of operation.

During engine trimming, the fuel control is checked for idle  rpm, maximum rpm, acceleration, and deceleration. The  procedures used to check the fuel control vary depending  on the aircraft and engine installation.  

The engine is trimmed in accordance with the procedures in  the maintenance or overhaul manual for a particular engine.  In general, the procedure consists of obtaining the ambient air  temperature and the field barometric pressure (not sea level)  immediately preceding the trimming of the engine. Care must  be taken to obtain a true temperature reading comparable to  that of the air that enters the engine. Using these readings, the  desired turbine discharge pressure or EPR (engine pressure  ratio) reading is computed from charts published in the  maintenance manual.  

The engine is operated at full throttle (or at the part power  control trim stop) for a sufficient period of time to ensure  that it has completely stabilized. Five minutes is the usual  recommended stabilization period. A check should be made  to ensure that the compressor air-bleed valves have fully  closed and that all accessory drive air bleed for which the  trim curve has not been corrected (such as a cabin air- conditioning unit) has been turned off. When the engine  has stabilized, a comparison is made of the observed and  the computed turbine discharge pressure Pt7 (or EPR) to  determine the approximate amount of trimming required. If  a trim is necessary, the engine fuel control is then adjusted  to obtain the target turbine discharge pressure Pt7 or EPR on  the gauge. Immediately following the fuel control adjustment,  the tachometer reading is observed and recorded. Fuel flow  and exhaust gas temperature readings should also be taken.  

On Pratt and Whitney engines, using a dual-spool compressor,  the observed N2 tachometer reading is next corrected for  speed bias by means of temperature/rpm curve. The observed  tachometer reading is divided by the percent trim speed  obtained from the curve. The result is the new engine trim  speed in percent, corrected to standard day (  $59\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or  $15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  )  temperature. The new trim speed in rpm may be calculated  when the rpm at which the tachometer reads 100 percent is  known. This value may be obtained from the appropriate  engine manual. If all these procedures have been performed  satisfactorily, the engine has been properly trimmed.  

Engine trimming should always be carried out under precisely  controlled conditions with the aircraft headed into the wind.  Precise control is necessary to ensure maintenance of a  minimum thrust level upon which the aircraft performance  is based. In addition, precise control of engine trimming  contributes to better engine life in terms of both maximum  time between overhaul and minimum out-of-commission  time due to engine maintenance requirements. Engines should  never be trimmed if icing conditions exist.  

Most electronic control fuel control systems do not require  trimming or mechanical adjustments. Changes to the EEC  in the FADEC system is normally accomplished through  software changes or changing the EEC.  

# Main Fuel Pumps (Engine Driven)  

Main fuel pumps deliver a continuous supply of fuel at  the proper pressure and at all times during operation of the  aircraft engine. The engine-driven fuel pump must be capable  of delivering the maximum needed flow at appropriate  pressure to obtain satisfactory nozzle spray and accurate  fuel regulation.  

These engine driven fuel pumps may be divided into two  distinct system categories:  

1.	 Nonconstant displacement and 2.	 Nonpositive displacement.  

Their use depends on where in the engine fuel system they  are used. A nonpositive-displacement pump produces a  continuous flow. However, because it does not provide  a positive internal seal against slippage, its output varies  considerably as pressure varies. Centrifugal and propeller  pumps are examples of nonpositive-displacement pumps.  If the output port of a nonpositive-displacement pump  was blocked off, the pressure would rise and output would  decrease to zero. Although the pumping element would  continue moving, flow would stop because of slippage  inside the pump. In a positive displacement pump, slippage  is negligible compared to the pump’s volumetric output flow.  If the output port were plugged, pressure would increase  instantaneously to the point that the pump pressure relief  valve opens. Generally, a nonpositive-displacement is used at  the inlet of the engine-driven pump to provide positive flow  to the second stage of the pump. The output of a centrifugal  pump can be varied as needed and is sometimes referred to  as a boost stage of the engine-driven pump.  

The second or main stage of the engine-driven fuel pump  for turbine engines is generally a positive displacement  type of pump. The term “positive displacement” means that  the gear supplies a fixed quantity of fuel to the engine for  every revolution of the pump gears. Gear-type pumps have  approximately straight line flow characteristics, whereas fuel  requirements fluctuate with flight or ambient air conditions.  Hence, a pump of adequate capacity at all engine operating  conditions has excess capacity over most of the range of  operation. This is the characteristic that requires the use  of a pressure relief valve for bypassing excess fuel back to  the inlet. A typical two-stage turbine engine driven pump is  illustrated in  Figure 2-60 . The impeller, which is driven at a  greater speed than the high pressure elements, increases the  fuel pressure depending upon engine speed.  

The fuel is discharged from the boost element (impeller)  to the two high-pressure gear elements. A relief valve is  

![](images/9c1807f7a7fbcf04f1493a01116ea49460a75d6de66479af6edb8dbcb97428aa.jpg)

incorporated in the discharge port of the pump. This valve  opens at a predetermined pressure and is capable of bypassing  the total fuel flow. This allows fuel in excess of that required  for engine operation at the time to be recirculated. The bypass fuel is routed to the inlet side of the second stage pump.  Fuel flows from the pump to the fuel metering unit or fuel  control. The fuel control is often attached to the fuel pump.  The fuel pump is also lubricated by the fuel passing through  the pump, and it should never be turned without fuel flow  supplied to the inlet of the pump. As the engine coasts down  at shutdown, the fuel pump should be provided with fuel until  it comes to a stop.  

# Fuel Heater  

Gas turbine engine fuel systems are very susceptible to the  formation of ice in the fuel filters. When the fuel in the aircraft  fuel tanks cools to  $32\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or below, residual water in the fuel  tends to freeze, forming ice crystals. When these ice crystals  in the fuel become trapped in the filter, they block fuel flow to  the engine, which causes a very serious problem. To prevent  this problem, the fuel is kept at a temperature above freezing.  Warmer fuel also can improve combustion, so some means  of regulating the fuel temperature is needed.  

The method of regulating fuel temperature is to use a fuel  heater which operates as a heat exchanger to warm the fuel.  The heater can use engine bleed air or engine lubricating oil  as a source of heat. The bleed air type is called an air-to-liquid  exchanger and the oil type is known as a liquid-to-liquid  heat exchanger. The function of a fuel heater is to protect the  engine fuel system from ice formation. However, should ice  form in the filter, the heater can also be used to thaw ice on  the fuel screen to allow fuel to flow freely again. On most  installations, the fuel filter is fitted with a pressure-drop  warning switch, which illuminates a warning light on the  flight deck instrument panel. If ice begins to collect on the  filter surface, the pressure across the filter slowly decreases.  When the pressure reaches a predetermined value, the  warning light alerts the flight deck personnel.  

Fuel deicing systems are designed to be used intermittently.  The control of the system may be manual, by a switch in  the flight deck, or automatic, using a thermostatic sensing  element in the fuel heater to open or close the air or oil shutoff  valve. A fuel heater system is shown in  Figure 2-61 . In a  FADEC system, the computer controls the fuel temperature  by sensing the fuel temperature and heating it as needed.  

# Fuel Filters  

A low-pressure filter is installed between the supply tanks and  the engine fuel system to protect the engine-driven fuel pump  and various control devices. An additional high-pressure fuel  filter is installed between the fuel pump and the fuel control  to protect the fuel control from contaminants that could come  from the low pressure pump.  

The three most common types of filters in use are the micron  filter, the wafer screen filter, and the plain screen mesh filter.  The individual use of each of these filters is dictated by the  filtering treatment required at a particular location. The  micron filter has the greatest filtering action of any present- day filter type and, as the name implies, is rated in microns.  [Figure 2-62]  (A micron is one thousandth of 1 millimeter.)  The porous cellulose material frequently used in construction  of the filter cartridges is capable of removing foreign matter  measuring from 10–25 microns. The minute openings make  this type of filter susceptible to clogging; therefore, a bypass  valve is a necessary safety factor.  

Since the micron filter does such a thorough job of removing  foreign matter, it is especially valuable between the fuel  tank and engine. The cellulose material also absorbs water,  preventing it from passing through the pumps. If water does  seep through the filter, which happens occasionally when  filter elements become saturated with water, the water can and  does quickly damage the working elements of the fuel pump  and control units, since these elements depend solely on the  fuel for their lubrication. To reduce water damage to pumps  and control units, periodic servicing and replacement of filter  elements is imperative. Daily draining of fuel tank sumps and  low-pressure filters eliminates much filter trouble and undue  maintenance of pumps and fuel control units.  

The most widely used fuel filters are the 200-mesh and the  35-mesh micron filters. They are used in fuel pumps, fuel  controls, and between the fuel pump and fuel control where  removal of micronic particles is needed. These filters, usually  made of fine-mesh steel wire, are a series of layers of wire.

Figure 2-62.   Aircraft fuel filter.  

The wafer screen type of filter has a replaceable element,  which is made of layers of screen discs of bronze, brass,  steel, or similar material.  [Figure 2-63]  This type of filter  is capable of removing micronic particles. It also has the  strength to withstand high pressure.  

# Fuel Spray Nozzles & Fuel Manifolds  

Although fuel spray nozzles are an integral part of the  fuel system, their design is closely related to the type of  combustion chamber in which they are installed. The fuel  nozzles inject fuel into the combustion area in a highly  atomized, precisely patterned spray so that burning is  completed evenly, in the shortest possible time, and in the  smallest possible space. It is very important that the fuel be  evenly distributed and well centered in the flame area within  the liners. This is to preclude the formation of any hot spots  or hot streaking in the combustion chambers and to prevent  the flame burning through the liner.  

Fuel nozzle types vary considerably between engines,  although for the most part fuel is sprayed into the combustion  area under pressure through small orifices in the nozzles. The  two types of fuel nozzles generally used are the simplex and  the duplex configurations. The duplex nozzle usually requires  a dual manifold and a pressurizing valve or flow divider for  dividing primary and secondary (main) fuel flow, but the  simplex nozzle requires only a single manifold for proper  fuel delivery.  

The fuel nozzles can be constructed to be installed in various  ways. The two methods used quite frequently are:  

1.	 External mounting wherein a mounting pad is provided  for attachment of the nozzles to the case or the inlet  air elbow, with the nozzle near the dome; or  

![](images/e5e25f40ffcbf701734b1343adff0c8029542a33dfffdc5a884c9e8c8cfdd3d3.jpg)  
Figure 2-63.   Wafer screen filter.  

2.	 Internal mounting at the liner dome, in which the  chamber cover must be removed for replacement or  maintenance of the nozzle.  

The nozzles used in a specific engine should be matched so  that they flow equal amounts of fuel. Even fuel distribution  is important to efficient combustion in the burner section.  The fuel nozzle must present a fine spray with the correct  pattern and optimum atomization.  

# Simplex Fuel Nozzle  

The simplex fuel nozzle was the first nozzle type used in  turbine engines and was replaced in most installations with  the duplex nozzle, which gave better atomization at starting  and idling speeds. The simplex nozzle is still being used  in several installations.  [Figure 2-64]  Each of the simplex  nozzles consists of a nozzle tip, an insert, and a strainer made  up of fine-mesh screen and a support.  

# Duplex Fuel Nozzle  

The duplex fuel nozzle is widely used in present day gas  turbine engines and produces two different spray patterns.  As mentioned previously, its use requires a flow divider,  but at the same time it offers a desirable spray pattern  for combustion over a wide range of operating pressures.  [Figure 2-65]  A nozzle typical of this type is illustrated in  Figure 2-66 .  

# Airblast Nozzles  

Airblast nozzles are used to provide improved mixing of the  fuel and airflow to provide an optimum spray for combustion.  As can be seen in  Figure 2-64 , swirl vanes are used to mix the  

![](images/d3e0ea344115ec8d12ef9040474e3674f2df8623d4725a072ca98ebe63928e57.jpg)

air and fuel at the nozzle opening. By using a proportion of  the primary combustion airflow in the fuel spray, locally rich  fuel concentrations can be reduced. This type of fuel nozzle  can be either simplex or duplex, depending upon the engine.  This nozzle type can operate at lower working pressures than  other nozzles which allows for lighter pumps. This airblast  nozzle also helps in reducing the tendency of the nozzle to  carbon up which can disturb the flow pattern.  

# Flow Divider  

A flow divider creates primary and secondary fuel supplies  that are discharged through separate manifolds, providing two  separate fuel flows.  [Figure 2-67]  Metered fuel from the fuel  control enters the inlet of the flow divider and passes through  an orifice and then on to the primary nozzles. A passage in the  flow divider directs fuel flow from both sides of the orifice  to a chamber. This chamber contains a differential pressure  bellows, a viscosity compensated restrictor (VCR), and a  surge dampener. During engine start, fuel pressure is applied  to the inlet port and across the VCR, surge dampener, and  on to the primary side of the nozzles. Fuel is also applied  under pressure to the outside of the flow divider bellows and  through the surge dampener to the inside of the flow divider  bellows. This unequal pressure causes the flow divider valve  to remain closed. When fuel flow increases, the differential  pressure on the bellows also increases. At a predetermined  pressure, the bellows compresses, allowing the flow divider  valve to open. This action starts fuel flow to the secondary  manifold, which increases the fuel flow to the engine. This  fuel flows out of the secondary opening in the nozzles.  

# Fuel Pressurizing & Dump Valves  

The fuel pressurizing valve is usually required on engines  incorporating duplex fuel nozzles to divide the flow into  primary and secondary manifolds. As the fuel required  for starting and altitude idling flows, it passes through the  primary line. As the fuel flow increases, the valve begins to  open the main line until at maximum flow the secondary line  is passing approximately 90 percent of the fuel.  

![](images/6d36b3ea7969f9cb06f576136a9bed6d5db2af266b014783ccf6e9aba0b7cc6b.jpg)

manifold, giving a positive cutoff. This cutoff prevents  fuel from dribbling into the manifold and through the fuel  nozzles, limiting afterfires and carbonization of the fuel  nozzles. Carbonization occurs because combustion chamber  temperatures are lowered, and the fuel is not completely  burned.  

A flow divider performs essentially the same function as a  pressurizing valve. It is used, as the name implies, to divide  flow to the duplex fuel nozzles. It is not unusual for units  performing identical functions to have different nomenclature  between engine manufacturers.  

# Combustion Drain Valves  

The drain valves are units used for draining fuel from the  various components of the engine where accumulated fuel  is most likely to present operating problems. The possibility  of combustion chamber accumulation with the resultant fire  hazard is one problem. A residual problem is leaving gum  deposits, after evaporation, in such places as fuel manifolds  and fuel nozzles.  

After the fuel accumulates in the bottom of the combustion  chamber or drain lines, the drain valve allows the fuel to  be drained whenever pressure within the manifold or the  burner(s) has been reduced to near atmospheric pressure.  A small spring holds the valve off its seat until pressure in  the combustion chamber during operation overcomes the  spring and closes the valve. The valve is closed during engine  operation. It is imperative that this valve be in good working  condition to drain accumulated fuel after each shutdown.  Otherwise, a hot start during the next starting attempt or an  afterfire after shutdown is likely to occur.  

# Fuel Quantity Indicating Units  

Fuel quantity units vary from one installation to the next. A  fuel counter or indicator, mounted on the instrument panel,  is electrically connected to a flow meter installed in the fuel  line to the engine.  

The fuel counter, or totalizer, is used to keep record of fuel  use. When the aircraft is serviced with fuel, the counter is  manually set to the total number of pounds of fuel in all  tanks. As fuel passes through the measuring element of the  flow meter, it sends electrical impulses to the fuel counter.  These impulses actuate the fuel counter mechanism so that  the number of pounds passing to the engine is subtracted  from the original reading. Thus, the fuel counter continually  shows the total quantity of fuel, in pounds, remaining in the  aircraft. However, there are certain conditions that cause the  fuel counter indication to be inaccurate. Any jettisoned fuel  is indicated on the fuel counter as fuel still available for use.  Any fuel that leaks from a tank or a fuel line upstream of the  flow meter is not counted.  

In some instances, the fuel manifolds are drained by an  individual unit known as a drip or dump valve. This type  of valve may operate by pressure differential, or it may be  solenoid operated.  

The combustion chamber drain valve drains fuel that  accumulates in the combustion chamber after each shutdown  and fuel that may have accumulated during a false start. If the  combustion chambers are the can type, fuel drains by gravity  down through the flame tubes or interconnector tubes until  it gathers in the lower chambers, which are fitted with drain  lines to the drain valve. If the combustion chamber is of the  basket or annular type, the fuel merely drains through the air  holes in the liner and accumulates in a trap in the bottom of  

# Chapter 3 Induction & Exhaust Systems  

# Reciprocating Engine Induction Systems  

The basic induction system of an aircraft reciprocating engine  consists of an air scoop used to collect the inlet air and ducting  that transfers the air to the inlet filter. The air filter is generally  housed in the carburetor heat box or other housing close by  that is attached to the carburetor or fuel injection controller.  The engine used in light aircraft is usually equipped with  either a carburetor or a fuel-injection system. After air passes  through the fuel metering device, an intake manifold with  long curved pipes or passages is used to send the air-fuel  mixture to the cylinders. An induction air scoop is shown in  Figure 3-1.  The air scoop is located on the engine cowling to  allow maximum airflow into the engine’s induction system.  The air filter, shown in  Figure 3-2,  prevents dirt and other  foreign matter from entering the engine. Filtered air enters  the fuel metering device (carburetor/fuel injector) where the  throttle plate controls the amount of air flowing to the engine.  The air coming out of the throttle is referred to as manifold  pressure. This pressure is measured in inches of mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   and controls engine power output.  

Induction systems can consist of several different  arrangements. Two that are used are the updraft and downdraft  induction systems. An updraft induction system   consists of  

![](images/74e43cb9516a29b689fdf3a74cc4a67cf1b984816121f657322a91473292f722.jpg)  
Figure 3-1.   Inlet scoop in engine cowling.  

two runners and a balance tube with intake pipes for each  cylinder to deliver induction air to each cylinder’s intake  port.  [Figure 3-3]  The balance tube is used to reduce pressure  imbalances between the two side induction runners. With  carbureted engines, it is important to maintain a constant and  even pressure in the induction system so that each cylinder  receives equal amounts of fuel. On fuel-injected engines,  the fuel is injected at the intake port just before the intake  valve. It is important with this system to keep the pressure  consistent at each intake port.  

A downdraft balanced induction system provides optimum  airflow to each of the individual cylinders throughout a  wide operational range.  [Figure 3-4]  Better matched air-fuel  ratios provide a much smoother and more efficient engine  operation. Air from the induction manifold flows into the  intake ports where it is mixed with fuel from the fuel nozzles  and then enters the cylinders as a combustible mixture as the  intake valve opens.  

# Basic Carburetor Induction System  

Figure 3-2  is a diagram of an induction system used in an  engine equipped with a carburetor. In this induction system,  carburetor normal flow air is admitted at the lower front nose  cowling below the propeller spinner and is passed through an  air filter into air ducts leading to the carburetor. A carburetor  heat air valve is located below the carburetor for selecting  an alternate warm air source (carburetor heat) to prevent  carburetor icing.  [Figure 3-5]  Carburetor icing occurs when  the temperature is lowered in the throat of the carburetor and  enough moisture is present to freeze and block the flow of air  to the engine. The carburetor heat valve admits air from the  outside air scoop for normal operation, and it admits warm  air from the engine compartment for operation during icing  conditions. The carburetor heat is operated by a push-pull  control in the flight deck. When the carburetor heat air door  is closed, warm ducted air from around the exhaust is directed  into the carburetor. This raises the intake air temperature.  An alternate air door can be opened by engine suction if the  normal route of airflow should be blocked by something.  The valve is spring loaded closed and is sucked open by the  engine if needed.  

The carburetor air filter, shown in  Figure 3-6,  is installed in  the air scoop in front of the carburetor air duct. Its purpose is

to stop dust and other foreign matter from entering the engine  through the carburetor. The screen consists of an aluminum  alloy frame and a deeply crimped screen, arranged to present  maximum screen area to the airstream. There are several types  of air filters in use including paper, foam, and other types of  filters. Most air filters require servicing at regular intervals  and the specific instructions for the type of filter must be  followed.  [Figure 3-6]  

The carburetor air ducts consist of a fixed duct riveted to the  nose cowling and a flexible duct between the fixed duct and  the carburetor air valve housing. The carburetor air ducts  normally provide a passage for outside air to the carburetor.  Applying carburetor heat to an operating engine decreases the  density of the air, which leans the air-fuel mixture. Air enters  the system through the ram-air intake. The intake opening is  located in the slipstream so the air is forced into the induction  system giving a ram effect to the incoming airflow. The air  passes through the air ducts to the carburetor. The carburetor  meters the fuel in proportion to the air and mixes the air with  

![](images/bf88aa314f04ff30e42fe20b2f6e381eea336134d9920c4de64ac98b5d2591a0.jpg)

the correct amount of fuel. The throttle plate of the carburetor  can be controlled from the flight deck to regulate the flow  of air (manifold pressure), and in this way, power output of  the engine can be controlled.  

Although many newer aircraft are not so-equipped, some  engines are equipped with carburetor air temperature  indicating systems which shows the temperature of the air  at the carburetor inlet. If the bulb is located at the engine  side of the carburetor, the system measures the temperature  of the air-fuel mixture.  

# Induction System Icing  

A short discussion concerning the formation and location of  induction system ice is helpful, even though a technician is  not normally concerned with operations that occur when the  aircraft is in flight.  [Figure 3-7]  Technicians should know  something about induction system icing because of its effect  on engine performance and troubleshooting. Even when an  inspection shows that everything is in proper working order  and the engine performs perfectly on the ground, induction  system ice can cause an engine to act erratically and lose  power in the air. Many engine troubles commonly attributed  to other sources are actually caused by induction system icing.  

Induction system icing is an operating hazard because it can  cut off the flow of the air-fuel charge or vary the air-fuel  ratio. Ice can form in the induction system while an aircraft  is flying in clouds, fog, rain, sleet, snow, or even clear air that  has high moisture content (high humidity). Induction system  icing is generally classified in three types:  

•	 Impact ice, •	 Fuel evaporation ice, and •	 Throttle ice.  

Induction system ice can be prevented or eliminated by raising  the temperature of the air that passes through the system,  using a carburetor heat system located upstream near the  induction system inlet and well ahead of the dangerous icing  

![](images/0af02f7883ab715923f28244cf0e9a52e6f6bad60ae1f7dcf8006d5f651084be.jpg)  
Figure 3-7.   Location of a carburetor heat air valve.  

zones. This air is collected by a duct surrounding the exhaust  manifold. Heat is usually obtained through a control valve  that opens  

the induction system to the warm air circulating in the engine  compartment and around the exhaust manifold.  

Improper or careless use of carburetor heat can be just as  dangerous as the most advanced stage of induction system  ice. Increasing the temperature of the air causes it to expand  and decrease in density. This action reduces the weight of the  charge delivered to the cylinder and causes a noticeable loss in  power because of decreased volumetric efficiency. If icing is  not present when carburetor heat or induction system anti-icing  is applied and the throttle setting does not change, the mixture  will become richer. In addition, high intake air temperature  may cause detonation and engine failure, especially during  takeoff and high power operation. Therefore, during all phases  of engine operation, the carburetor temperature must afford  the greatest protection against icing and detonation.  

When there is danger of induction system icing, the flight deck  carburetor heat control is moved to the hot position. Throttle  ice or any ice that restricts airflow or reduces manifold  pressure can best be removed by using full carburetor heat.  

If the heat from the engine compartment is sufficient and the  application has not been delayed, it is only a matter of a few  minutes until the ice is cleared.  

When there is no danger of icing, the heat control is normally  kept in the “cold” position. It is best to leave the control in  this position if there are particles of dry snow or ice in the air.  The use of heat may melt the ice or snow, and the resulting  moisture may collect and freeze on the walls of the induction  system. To prevent damage to the heater valves in the case of  backfire, carburetor heat should not be used while starting the  engine. Also, during ground operation only enough carburetor  heat should be used to give smooth engine operation.  

Part-throttle operation can lead to icing in the throttle area.  When the throttle is placed in a partly closed position, it, in  effect, limits the amount of air available to the engine. When  the aircraft is in a glide, a fixed-pitch propeller windmills,  causing the engine to consume more air than it normally  would at this same throttle setting, thus adding to the lack of  air behind the throttle. The partly closed throttle, under these  circumstances, establishes a much higher than normal air  velocity past the throttle, and an extremely low-pressure area is  produced. The low-pressure area lowers the temperature of the  air surrounding the throttle valve. If the temperature in this air  falls below freezing and moisture is present, ice forms on the  throttles and nearby units restricting the airflow to the engine  causing it to quit. Throttle ice may be minimized on engines  equipped with controllable-pitch propellers by the use of a  higher than normal brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) at  this low power. The high BMEP decreases the icing tendency  because a large throttle opening at low engine revolutions  per minute (rpm) partially removes the temperature-reducing  obstruction that part-throttle operation offers.  

# Induction System Filtering  

Dust and dirt can be a serious source of trouble to an aircraft  engine. Dust consists of small particles of hard, abrasive  material that can be carried by the air and drawn into the  engine cylinders. It can also collect on the fuel-metering  elements of the carburetor, upsetting the proper relation  between airflow and fuel flow at all engine power settings. It  acts on the cylinder walls by grinding down these surfaces and  the piston rings. Then, it contaminates the oil and is carried  through the engine, causing further wear on the bearings and  gears. In extreme cases, an accumulation may clog an oil  passage and cause oil starvation. Although dust conditions  are most critical at ground level, continued operation under  such conditions without engine protection results in extreme  engine wear and can produce excessive oil consumption.  When operation in a dusty atmosphere is necessary, the  engine can be protected by an alternate induction system air  inlet which incorporates a dust filter. This type of air filter  system normally consists of a filter element, a door, and  an electrically operated actuator. When the filter system is  operating, air is drawn through a louvered access panel that  does not face directly into the airstream. With this entrance  location, considerable dust is removed as the air is forced  to turn and enter the duct. Since the dust particles are solid,  they tend to continue in a straight line, and most of them are  separated at this point. Those that are drawn into the louvers  are easily removed by the filter.  

In flight, with air filters operating, consideration must be  given to possible icing conditions which may occur from  actual surface icing or from freezing of the filter element  after it becomes rain soaked. Some installations have a  spring-loaded filter door which automatically opens when  the filter is excessively restricted. This prevents the airflow  from being cut off when the filter is clogged with ice or dirt.  Other systems use an ice guard in the filtered-air entrance.  

The ice guard consists of a coarse-mesh screen located a short  distance from the filtered-air entrance. In this location, the  screen is directly in the path of incoming air so that the air  must pass through or around the screen. When ice forms on  the screen, the air, which has lost its heavy moisture particles,  passes around the iced screen and into the filter element.  The efficiency of any filter system depends upon proper  maintenance and servicing. Periodic removal and cleaning of  the filter element is essential to satisfactory engine protection.  

# Induction System Inspection & Maintenance  

The induction system should be checked for cracks and leaks  during all regularly scheduled engine inspections. The units  of the system should be checked for security of mounting.  The system should be kept clean at all times, since pieces of  rags or paper can restrict the airflow if allowed to enter the  air intakes or ducts. Loose bolts and nuts can cause serious  damage if they pass into the engine.  

On systems equipped with a carburetor air filter, the filter  should be checked regularly. If it is dirty or does not have  the proper oil film, the filter element should be removed and  cleaned. After it has dried, it is usually immersed in a mixture  of oil and rust-preventive compound. The excess fluid should  be allowed to drain off before the filter element is reinstalled.  Paper-type filters should be inspected and replaced as needed.  The efficiency of any filter system depends upon proper  maintenance and servicing. Periodic removal and cleaning of  the filter element is essential to satisfactory engine protection.  If the induction system air filter becomes excessively dirty, it  will cause a loss of power or the engine will not start.  

# Extinguishing Engine Fires  

In all cases, a fireguard should stand by with a   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   fire  

![](images/40fda511a0e7098348d07637d7e3a374b4919ca739df2f70591549d31f7d255c.jpg)

extinguisher while the aircraft engine is being started. This  is a necessary precaution against fire during the starting  procedure. The fireguard must be familiar with the induction  system of the engine so that in case of fire, they can direct  the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   into the air intake of the engine to extinguish it. A  fire could also occur in the exhaust system of the engine from  liquid fuel being ignited in the cylinder and expelled during  the normal rotation of the engine.  

If an engine fire develops during the starting procedure,  continue cranking to start the engine and blow out the fire.  If the engine does not start and the fire continues to burn,  discontinue the start attempt. The fireguard then extinguishes  the fire using the available equipment. The fireguard must  observe all safety practices at all times while standing by  during the starting procedure.  

# Induction System Troubleshooting  

Figure 3-8  provides a general guide to the most common  induction system troubles.  

# Supercharged Induction Systems  

Since aircraft operate at altitudes where the air pressure is  lower, it is useful to provide a system for compressing the  air-fuel mixture. Some systems are used to normalize the air  pressure entering the engine. These systems are used to regain  the air pressure lost by the increase in altitude. This type of  system is not a ground boost system and it is not used to ever  boost the manifold pressure above 30 inches of mercury. A  true supercharged engine, called ground boosted engines, can  boost the manifold pressure above 30 inches of mercury. In  other words, a true supercharger boosts the manifold pressure  above ambient pressure.  

Since many engines installed in light aircraft do not  use any type of compressor or supercharging device,  induction systems for reciprocating engines can be broadly  classified as supercharged or nonsupercharged.  [Figure 3-9] Supercharging systems used in reciprocating engine induction  systems are normally classified as either internally driven or  externally driven (turbo supercharged). Internally driven  superchargers compress the air-fuel mixture after it leaves  the carburetor, while externally driven superchargers  (turbochargers) compress the air before it is mixed with the  

![](images/b6fc1c660da7ef575c7c8c1971f652c2b00351160881359fcbca4dc4fae0456d.jpg)  
Figure 3-9.   An example of a naturally aspirated reciprocating  engine.  

# Internally Driven Superchargers  

Internally-driven superchargers were used almost exclusively  in high horsepower radial reciprocating engines and are  engine driven through a mechanical connection. Although  their use is very limited, some are still used in cargo  carriers and spray planes. Except for the construction and  arrangement of the various types of superchargers, all  induction systems with internally driven superchargers were  very similar. Aircraft engines require the same air temperature  control to produce good combustion in the engine cylinders.  For example, the charge must be warm enough to ensure  complete fuel vaporization and, thus, even distribution. At  the same time, it must not be so hot that it reduces volumetric  efficiency or causes detonation. All reciprocating engines  must guard against intake air that is too hot. As with any  type of supercharging (compressing intake air), the air gains  heat as it is compressed. Sometimes this air requires cooling  before it is routed to the engine’s intake ports. With these  requirements, most induction systems that use internally  driven superchargers must include pressure and temperature- sensing devices and the necessary units required to warm or  cool the air.  

The simple internally driven supercharger induction system is  used to explain the location of units and the path of the air and  air-fuel mixture. [ Figure 3-10]  Air enters the system through  the ram air intake. The intake opening is located so that the  air is forced into the induction system, giving a ram effect  caused by the aircraft moving through the air. The air passes  through ducts to the carburetor. The carburetor meters the  fuel in proportion to the air and mixes the air with the correct  amount of fuel. The carburetor can be controlled from the  flight deck to regulate the flow of air. In this way, the power  output of the engine can be controlled. The manifold pressure  gauge measures the pressure of the air-fuel mixture before it  enters the cylinders. It is an indication of the performance that  can be expected of the engine. The carburetor air temperature  indicator measures either the temperature of the inlet air or  of the air-fuel mixture. Either the air inlet or the mixture  temperature indicator serves as a guide so that the temperature  of the incoming charge may be kept within safe limits. If  the temperature of the incoming air at the entrance to the  carburetor scoop is   $100\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , there is approximately a   $50~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  drop in temperature because of the partial vaporization of the  fuel at the carburetor discharge nozzle. Partial vaporization  takes place and the air temperature falls due to absorption  of the heat by vaporization. The final vaporization takes  place as the mixture enters the cylinders where higher  temperatures exist. The fuel, as atomized into the airstream  that flows in the induction system, is in a globular form.  The problem, then, becomes one of uniformly breaking up  and distributing the fuel, remaining in globular form to the  various cylinders. On engines equipped with a large number  of cylinders, the uniform distribution of the mixture becomes  a greater problem, especially at high engine speeds when full  advantage is taken of large air capacity.  

One method used mainly on radial reciprocating engines of  improving fuel distribution is shown in  Figure 3-11.  This  device is known as a distribution impeller. The impeller is  attached directly to the end of the rear shank of the crankshaft  by bolts or studs. Since the impeller is attached to the end  of the crankshaft and operates at the same speed, it does  not materially boost or increase the pressure on the mixture  

![](images/f3180cb6f3364026f0b7dee86af0743e73fcb55afc7cb30dbdf62495985fc271.jpg)

flowing into the cylinders. But, the fuel remaining in the  globular form is broken up into finer particles as it strikes the  impeller, thereby coming in contact with more air. This creates  a more homogeneous mixture with a consequent improvement
 in distribution to the various cylinders, especially on  acceleration of the engine or when low temperatures prevail.  

To obtain greater pressure of the air-fuel mixture within the  cylinders, the diffuser or blower section contains a high speed  impeller. Unlike the distribution impeller, which is connected  directly to the crankshaft, the supercharger, or blower  impeller, is driven through a gear train from the crankshaft.  

# Turbosupercharger s  

Externally driven superchargers (turbosupercharger s)  are designed to deliver compressed air to the inlet of the  carburetor or air-fuel control unit of an engine. Externally  driven superchargers derive their power from the energy of  engine exhaust gases directed against a turbine that drives  an impeller that compresses the incoming air. For this  reason, they are commonly called turbosupercharger s or  turbochargers. To be a true supercharger, it must boost the  manifold pressure above  $30\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .  

The typical turbosupercharger, shown in  Figure 3-12,  is  composed of three main parts:  

1. 	 Compressor assembly, 2. 	 Turbine wheel assembly, and 3. 	 A full floating shaft bearing assembly.  

Detail examples of a turbosupercharger are shown in  Figure 3-13.  In addition to the major assemblies, there is a  baffle between the compressor casing and the exhaust-gas  turbine that directs cooling air to the pump and bearing casing,  and also shields the compressor from the heat radiated by the  turbine. In installations where cooling air is limited, the baffle  is replaced by a regular cooling shroud that receives its air  directly from the induction system.  

The compressor assembly is made up of an impeller, a  diffuser, and a casing. The air for the induction system enters  through a circular opening in the center of the compressor  casing, where it is picked up by the blades of the impeller,  which gives it high velocity as it travels outward toward the  diffuser. The diffuser vanes direct the airflow as it leaves  the impeller and also converts the high velocity of the air  to high-pressure.  

Motive power for the impeller is furnished through the  impeller’s attachment to the turbine wheel shaft of the  exhaust-gas turbine. This complete assembly is referred to as  the rotor. (The rotor revolves on the oil feed bearings. )  The  exhaust gas turbine assembly consists of the turbocharger and  waste gate valve.  [Figure 3-14]  The turbine wheel, driven by  exhaust gases, drives the impeller. The turbo housing collects  and directs the exhaust gases onto the turbine wheel, and the  waste gate regulates the amount of exhaust gases directed to  the turbine. The waste gate controls the volume of the exhaust  gas that is directed onto the turbine and thereby regulates  the speed of the rotor (turbine and impeller).  [Figure 3-15]  

If the waste gate is completely closed, all the exhaust gases  are “backed up” and forced through the turbine wheel. If the  waste gate is partially closed, a corresponding amount of  exhaust gas is directed to the turbine. The exhaust gasses, thus  directed, strike the turbine blades, arranged radially around  the outer edge of the turbine, and cause the rotor (turbine and  impeller) to rotate. The gases, having exhausted most of their  energy, are then exhausted overboard. When the waste gate  is fully open, nearly all of the exhaust gases pass overboard  providing little or no boost.

# Normalizer Turbocharger  

Some engines used in light aircraft are equipped with an  externally driven normalizing system. These systems are  powered by the energy of exhaust gases and are usually referred  to as “normalizing turbocharger” systems. These systems were  not designed to be used as a true supercharger (boost manifold  pressure over  $30\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  ). They compensate for the power lost due  to the pressure drop resulting from increased altitude. On many  small aircraft engines, the turbocharger (normalizing) system  is designed to be operated only above a certain altitude, 5,000  feet for example, since maximum power without normalizing is  available below that altitude. The location of the air induction  and exhaust systems of a typical normalizing turbocharger  system for a small aircraft is shown in  Figure 3-16.  

# Ground-Boosted Turbosupercharger System  

Some ground-boosted (sea level) turbo supercharged systems  are designed to operate from sea level up to their critical altitude.  These engines, sometimes referred to as sea level-boosted  engines, can develop more power at sea level than an engine  without turbo supercharging. As was mentioned earlier, an  engine must be boosted above  $30\,"\mathrm{Hg}$   to truly be supercharged.  This type of turbocharger accomplishes this by increasing the  manifold pressure above  $30\,"\mathrm{Hg}$   to around  $40\,"\mathrm{Hg}$  .  

The turbosupercharger air induction system consists of a  filtered ram-air intake located on the side of the nacelle.  [Figure 3-17]  An alternate air door within the nacelle permits  compressor suction automatically to admit alternate air  (heated engine compartment air) if the induction air filter  becomes clogged. In many cases, the alternate air door can  be operated manually in the event of filter clogging.  

Almost all turbocharger systems use engine oil as the control  fluid for controlling the amount of boost (extra manifold  pressure) provided to the engine. The waste-gate actuator and  controllers use pressurized engine oil for their power supply.  The turbocharger is controlled by the waste gate and waste  gate actuator. The waste gate actuator, which is physically  connected to the waste gate by mechanical linkage, controls  

![](images/1aadbd372ac2ca0d45be00a09c4713a5328b362dc6396000d654a617f7de241a.jpg)  
Figure 3-16.   Typical location of the air induction and exhaust systems of a normalizing turbocharger system.  

the position of the waste gate butterfly valve. The waste gate  bypasses the engine exhaust gases around the turbocharger  turbine inlet. By controlling the amount of exhaust gases that pass through the turbine of the turbocharger, the speed  of the compressor and the amount of intake boost (upper  deck pressure) is controlled. Engine oil is also used to cool  and lubricate the bearings that support the compressor and  turbine in the turbocharger. Turbocharger lubricating oil is  engine oil supplied through the engine oil system. An oil  supply hose from the rear of the oil cooler directs oil to the  turbocharger center housings and bearings. Oil hoses return  oil from the turbochargers to the oil scavenge pump located  on the rear of the engine. The one-way check valve in the oil  supply line prevents oil from draining into the turbocharger  while the engine is not operating. Piston ring-like oil seals are  used on the compressor wheel shaft to prevent the lubricating  oil from entering the turbine and compressor housings from  the center housing.  

The position of the waste gate is controlled by adjusting the  oil pressure in the waste gate actuator. Several different types  of controllers are used to provide the correct pressure in the  waste gate actuator. This is done either by restricting the oil  flow or by allowing the oil to return to the engine. The more  the oil is restricted, the more pressure is in the waste gate  actuator and the more closed the waste gate is. This causes  the exhaust gases to pass through the turbine, increasing the  speed of the compressor raising the inlet pressure. The reverse  happens if the oil is not restricted by the controllers and boost  is reduced. The pressure from the outlet of the compressor of  the turbocharger to the throttle is referred to as deck pressure  or upper deck pressure.  

# A Typical Turbosupercharger System  

Figure 3-18  is a schematic of a sea level booster  turbosupercharger system. This system used widely is  automatically regulated by three components:  

•	 Exhaust bypass valve assembly, •	 Density controller, and •	 Differential pressure controller.  

By regulating the waste gate position and the “fully open”  and “closed” positions, a constant power output can be  maintained. When the waste gate is fully open, all the exhaust  gases are directed overboard to the atmosphere, and no air is  compressed and delivered to the engine air inlet. Conversely,  when the waste gate is fully closed, a maximum volume  of exhaust gases flows into the turbocharger turbine, and  maximum supercharging is accomplished. Between these  

![](images/7337253504c2d85550ab1c5174f30e95203cf38926b32f2df95e0dab493b2406.jpg)  
Figure 3-17.   A turbocharger air induction system.

Figure 3-18.   Sea level booster turbosupercharger system.  

two extremes of waste gate position, constant power output  can be achieved below the maximum altitude at which the  system is designed to operate. An engine with a critical  altitude of 16,000 feet cannot produce 100 percent of its rated  manifold pressure above 16,000 feet. Critical altitude means  the maximum altitude at which, in standard atmosphere, it  is possible to maintain, at a specified rotational speed, a  specified power or a specified manifold pressure.  

A critical altitude exists for every possible power setting  below the maximum operating ceiling. If the aircraft is  flown above this altitude without a corresponding change in  the power setting, the waste gate is automatically driven to  the fully closed position in an effort to maintain a constant  power output. Thus, the waste gate is almost fully open at sea  level and continues to move toward the closed position as the  aircraft climbs, in order to maintain the preselected manifold  pressure setting. When the waste gate is fully closed (leaving  only a small clearance to prevent sticking), the manifold  pressure begins to drop if the aircraft continues to climb. If  a higher power setting cannot be selected, the turbocharger’s  critical altitude has been reached. Beyond this altitude, the  power output continues to decrease. If a turbocharger waste  gate will not close fully, then the aircraft will not be able to  reach its critical altitude.  

The position of the waste gate valve, which determines power  output, is controlled by oil pressure. Engine oil pressure acts  on a piston in the waste gate assembly, which is connected  by linkage to the waste gate valve. When oil pressure is  increased on the piston, the waste gate valve moves toward  the closed position, and engine output power increases.  Conversely, when the oil pressure is decreased, the waste gate  valve moves toward the open position, and output power is  decreased as described earlier.  

The position of the piston attached to the waste gate valve is  dependent on bleed oil, which controls the engine oil pressure  applied to the top of the piston. Oil is returned to the engine  crankcase through two control devices, the density controller  and the differential pressure controller. These two controllers,  acting independently, determine how much oil is bled back to  the crankcase and establishes the oil pressure on the piston.  

![](images/9a6181b92375bf8a15673231dff122afad3e4835b062379e59e6700b0995b865.jpg)  
Figure 3-19.   Components of a turbocharger system engine.  

The density controller is designed to limit the manifold  pressure below the turbocharger’s critical altitude and regulates  bleed oil only at the full throttle position. The pressure- and  temperature-sensing bellows of the density controller react to  pressure and temperature changes between the fuel injector  inlet and the turbocharger compressor. The bellows, filled  with dry nitrogen, maintain a constant density by allowing the  pressure to increase as the temperature increases. Movement  of the bellows repositions the bleed valve, causing a change  in the quantity of bleed oil, which changes the oil pressure on  top of the waste gate piston.  [Figure 3-18]  

The differential pressure controller functions during all  positions of the waste gate valve other than the fully open  position, which is controlled by the density controller. One  side of the diaphragm in the differential pressure controller  senses air pressure upstream from the throttle; the other side  samples pressure on the cylinder side of the throttle valve.  [Figure 3-18]  At the “wide open” throttle position when the  density controller controls the waste gate, the pressure across  the differential pressure controller diaphragm is at a minimum  and the controller spring holds the bleed valve closed. At “part  throttle” position, the air differential is increased, opening  the bleed valve to bleed oil to the engine crankcase and  reposition the waste gate piston. Thus, the two controllers  operate independently to control turbocharger operation at all  positions of the throttle. Without the overriding function of the  differential pressure controller during part-throttle operation,  the density controller would position the waste gate valve for  maximum power. The differential pressure controller reduces  injector entrance pressure and continually repositions the  valve over the whole operating range of the engine.  

The differential pressure controller reduces the unstable  condition known as “bootstrapping” during part-throttle  operation. Bootstrapping is an indication of unregulated power  change that results in the continual drift of manifold pressure.  This condition can be illustrated by considering the operation  of a system when the waste gate is fully closed. During this  time, the differential pressure controller is not modulating the  waste gate valve position. Any slight change in power caused  by a change in temperature or rpm fluctuation is magnified  and results in manifold pressure change since the slight change  causes a change in the amount of exhaust gas flowing to the  turbine. Any change in exhaust gas flow to the turbine causes  a change in power output and is reflected in manifold pressure  indications. Bootstrapping, then, is an undesirable cycle of  turbocharging events causing the manifold pressure to drift  in an attempt to reach a state of equilibrium.  

Bootstrapping is sometimes confused with the condition  known as overboost, but bootstrapping is not a condition that  is detrimental to engine life. An overboost condition is one in  which manifold pressure exceeds the limits prescribed for a  particular engine and can cause serious damage. A pressure  relief valve when used in some systems, set slightly in excess  of maximum deck pressure, is provided to prevent damaging  over boost in the event of a system malfunction.  

The differential pressure controller is essential to smooth  functioning of the automatically controlled turbocharger,  since it reduces bootstrapping by reducing the time required  to bring a system into equilibrium. There is still extra  throttle sensitivity with a turbocharged engine than with a  naturally aspirated engine. Rapid movement of the throttle  can cause a certain amount of manifold pressure drift in a  turbocharged engine. Less severe than bootstrapping, this  condition is called overshoot. While overshoot is not a  dangerous condition, it can be a source of concern to the  pilot or operator who selects a particular manifold pressure  setting only to find it has changed in a few seconds and must  be reset. Since the automatic controls cannot respond rapidly  enough to abrupt changes in throttle settings to eliminate the  inertia of turbocharger speed changes, overshoot must be  controlled by the operator. This can best be accomplished by  slowly making changes in throttle setting, accompanied by a  few seconds’ wait for the system to reach a new equilibrium.  Such a procedure is effective with turbocharged engines,  regardless of the degree of throttle sensitivity.  

# Turbocharger Controllers & System Descriptions  

Turbocharger system   engines contain many of the same  components mentioned with the previous systems.  [Figure 3-19]  Some systems use special lines and fittings that  are connected to the upper-deck pressure for air reference to  the fuel injection system and in some cases for pressurizing  the magnetos. Basic system operation is similar to other  turbocharger systems with the main differences being in the  controllers. The controller monitors deck pressure by sensing  the output of the compressor. The controller controls the oil  flow through the waste gate actuator, which opens or closes  the exhaust bypass valve. If a malfunction occurs causing  the waste gate or controller to not be stable, it will cause the  engine to surge due to an erratic manifold pressure. When  deck pressure is insufficient, the controller restricts oil flow  thereby increasing oil pressure at the waste gate actuator. This  pressure acts on the piston to close off the waste gate valve,  

![](images/10ef35b918794a66c5b5aaab3de2b69d7631387e6b063800d940c5441f7f8cdb.jpg)  
Figure 3-20.   An aftercooler installation.  

forcing more exhaust gas pulses to turn the turbine faster and  cause an increase in compressor output. When deck pressure  is too great, the opposite occurs. The exhaust waste gate fully  opens and bypasses some of the exhaust gases to decrease  exhaust flow across the turbine. An aftercooler is installed  in the induction air path between the compressor stage and  the air throttle inlet.  [Figure 3-20]  

Most turbochargers are capable of compressing the induction  air to the point at which it can raise the air temperature by a  factor of five. This means that full power takeoff on a   $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$    day could produce induction air temperatures exiting the  compressor at up to  $500\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . This would exceed the allowable  throttle air inlet temperature on all reciprocating engine  models. Typically, the maximum air throttle inlet temperature  ranges from a low   $230~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to a high of   $300\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Exceeding  these maximums can place the combustion chambers closer  to detonation. The function of the aftercooler is to cool the  compressed air, which decreases the likelihood of detonation  and increases the charge air density, which improves the  turbocharger performance for that engine design. On engine  start, the controller senses insufficient compressor discharge  pressure (deck pressure) and restricts the flow of oil from the   waste gate actuator to the engine. This causes the waste gate  butterfly valve to close. As the throttle is advanced, exhaust  gas flows across the turbine increases, thereby increasing  turbine/compressor shaft speed and compressor discharge  pressure. The controller senses the difference between  upper deck and manifold pressure. If either deck pressure  or throttle differential pressure rises, the controller poppet  valve opens, relieving oil pressure to the waste gate actuator.  This decreases turbocharger compressor discharge pressure  (deck pressure).  

Variable Absolute Pressure Controller (VAPC)  The VAPC contains an oil control valve similar to the other  

![](images/e7b3c992adfadba06d1621bee8498d7590e96d1e374f7c54bd710d07ce55624f.jpg)  
Figure 3-21.   A diagram of a variable absolute pressure controller  (VAPC).  

controllers that were discussed.  [Figure 3-21]  The oil  restrictor is actuated by an aneroid bellows that is referenced  to upper deck pressure. A cam connected to the throttle  mechanism applies pressure to the restrictor valve and  aneroid. As the throttle is opened to greater values, the cam  applies a greater pressure to the aneroid. This increases the  amount of upper deck pressure necessary to compress the  aneroid and thereby open the oil restrictor valve. This means  that the scheduled absolute value of upper deck pressure that  is required to overcome the aneroid is variable by throttle  position. As the throttle is opened wide, the manifold pressure  and upper deck pressure requirements greatly increase.  

# Sloped Controller  

The sloped controller is designed to maintain the rated  compressor discharge pressure at wide-open throttle and to  reduce this pressure at part throttle settings.  [Figure 3-22]   A diaphragm, coupled with a spring-supported bellows for  absolute pressure reference, is exposed to deck pressure and  intake manifold pressure through ports located before and  after the throttle, respectively. This arrangement constantly  monitors deck pressure and the pressure differential between  the deck and manifold pressure due to a partially closed  throttle. If either deck pressure or throttle differential pressure  

![](images/cd602712b04a199934131df1fcf9f7500b8f5d67e21a10c486b888a5954e34d2.jpg)  
Figure 3-22.   A diagram of a sloped controller used to maintain the  rated compressor discharge pressure at wide-open throttle.  

rises, the controller poppet opens and decreases turbocharger  discharge (deck) pressure. The sloped controller is more  sensitive to the throttle differential pressure than to deck  pressure, thereby accomplishing deck pressure reduction as  the throttle is closed.  

# Absolute Pressure Controller  

One device used to control the speed and output of the  turbocharger, but controls the system only at maximum  output, is the absolute pressure controller. The absolute  pressure controller contains an aneroid bellows that is  referenced to upper deck pressure. It operates the waste gate,  which diverts, more or less, exhaust gas over the turbine.  As an absolute pressure setting is reached, it bypasses  oil, and relieves the pressure on the waste gate actuator.  This allows the absolute pressure controller to control the  maximum turbocharger compressor discharge pressure. The  turbocharger is completely automatic, requiring no pilot  action up to the critical altitude.

# Turbine Engine Inlet Systems  

The engine inlet of a turbine engine is designed to provide a  relatively distortion-free flow of air, in the required quantity,  to the inlet of the compressor.  [Figure 3-24]  Many engines  use inlet guide vanes (IGV) to help straighten the airflow and  direct it into the first stages of the compressor. A uniform and  steady airflow is necessary to avoid compressor stall (airflow  tends to stop or reverse direction of flow) and excessive  internal engine temperatures in the turbine section. Normally,  the air-inlet duct is considered an airframe part and not a  part of the engine. However, the duct is very important to  the engine’s overall performance and the engine’s ability to  produce an optimum amount of thrust.  

A gas turbine engine consumes considerable more airflow  than a reciprocating engine. The air entrance passage is  correspondingly larger. Furthermore, it is more critical in  determining engine and aircraft performance, especially  at high airspeeds. Inefficiencies of the inlet duct result in  successively magnified losses through other components of  the engine. The inlet varies according to the type of turbine  engine. Small turboprop and turboshaft engines have a  lower airflow than large turbofan engines which require a  completely different type of inlet. Many turboprop, auxiliary   power units, and turboshaft engines use screens that cover  the inlet to prevent foreign object damage (FOD).  

![](images/be03f8cd73118c22489f9e8207dd5b442eade80164e7a1e16042e57a2aefc188.jpg)  
Figure 3-24.   An example of a turbine engine inlet.  

As aircraft speed increases, thrust tends to decrease  somewhat; as the aircraft speed reaches a certain point, ram  recovery compensates for the losses caused by the increases  in speed. The inlet must be able to recover as much of the total  pressure of the free airstream as possible. As air molecules  are trapped and begin to be compressed in the inlet, much  of the pressure loss is recovered. This added pressure at the  inlet of the engine increases the pressure and airflow to the  engine. This is known as “ram recovery” or “total pressure  recovery.” The inlet duct must uniformly deliver air to  the compressor inlet with as little turbulence and pressure  variation as possible. The engine inlet duct must also hold  the drag effect on the aircraft to a minimum.  

Air pressure drop in the engine inlet is caused by the friction  of the air along both sides of the duct and by the bends in the  duct system. Smooth flow depends upon keeping the amount  of turbulence to a minimum as the air enters the duct. On  engines with low flow rates, turning the airflow allows the  engine nacelle to be smaller and have less drag. On turbofan  engines, the duct must have a sufficiently straight section to  ensure smooth, even airflow because of the high airflows.  The choice of configuration of the entrance to the duct is  dictated by the location of the engine within the aircraft  and the airspeed, altitude, and attitude at which the aircraft  is designed to operate. To accomplish this, inlet ducts are  designed to function as diffusers with a divergent shape,  decreasing the velocity and increasing the static pressure of  the air passing through them.  

# Divided-Entrance Duct  

The requirements of high-speed, single- or twin-engine  military aircraft, in which the pilot sits low in the fuselage and  close to the nose, render it difficult to employ the older type  single-entrance duct, which is not used on modern aircraft.  Some form of a divided duct, which takes air from either side  of the fuselage, has become fairly widely used. This divided  duct can be either a wing-root inlet or a scoop at each side of  the fuselage.  [Figure 3-25]  Either type of duct presents more  problems to the aircraft designer than a single-entrance duct  because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient airscoop area  without imposing prohibitive amounts of drag. Internally,  the problem is the same as that encountered with the single- entrance duct: to construct a duct of reasonable length with  as few bends as possible. Scoops at the sides of the fuselage  are often used. These side scoops are placed as far forward  as possible to permit a gradual bend toward the compressor  inlet, making the airflow characteristics approach those of a  single-entrance duct. A series of turning vanes is sometimes  placed in the side-scoop inlet to assist in straightening the  incoming airflow and to prevent turbulence.  

![](images/e2d2788ea097c54789a2b58bd550f601d81b08ae14f366eb9c25a61cfd506c77.jpg)  
Figure 3-25.   An example of a divided-entrance duct.  

# Variable-Geometry Duct  

The main function of an inlet duct is to furnish the proper  amount of air to the engine inlet. In a typical military aircraft  using a turbojet or low bypass turbofan engine, the maximum  airflow requirements are such that the Mach number of the  airflow directly ahead of the face of the engine is less than  Mach 1. Airflow through the engine must be less than Mach 1  at all times. Therefore, under all flight conditions, the velocity  of the airflow as it enters the air-inlet duct must be reduced  through the duct before the airflow is ready to enter the  compressor. To accomplish this, inlet ducts are designed to  function as diffusers, decreasing the velocity and increasing the  static pressure of the air passing through them.  [Figure 3-26]  

As with military supersonic aircraft, a diffuser progressively  decreases in area in the downstream direction. Therefore, a  supersonic inlet duct follows this general configuration until  the velocity of the incoming air is reduced to Mach 1. The  

![](images/cb9cb52bab1aba4ecfdd1c5970a90e499f76624f07c8a42e70646907b49bc295.jpg)  
Figure 3-26.   An inlet duct acts as a diffuser to decrease the airflow  velocity and to increase the static pressure of air.  

aft section of the duct then increases in area, since this part  must act as a subsonic diffuser.  [Figure 3-27]  In practice, inlet  ducts for supersonic aircraft follows this general design only  as much as practical, depending upon the design features of  the aircraft. For very high speed aircraft, the inside area of  configuration of the duct is changed by a mechanical device  as the speed of the aircraft increases or decreases. A duct of  this type is usually known as a variable-geometry inlet duct. Military aircraft use the three methods described above to  diffuse the inlet air and slow the inlet airflow at supersonic  flight speeds. One is to vary the area, or geometry, of the inlet  duct either by using a movable restriction, such as a ramp  or wedge, inside the duct. Another system is some sort of a  variable airflow bypass arrangement, which extracts part of  the inlet airflow from the duct ahead of the engine. In some  cases, a combination of both systems is used.  

The third method is the use of a shock wave in the airstream.  A shock wave is a thin region of discontinuity in a flow of  air or gas, during which the speed, pressure, density, and  temperature of the air or gas undergo a sudden change.  Stronger shock waves produce larger changes in the  properties of the air or gas. A shock wave is willfully set up  in the supersonic flow of the air entering the duct, by means  of some restriction or small obstruction which automatically  protrudes into the duct at high flight Mach numbers. The  shock wave results in diffusion of the airflow, which, in turn,  decreases the velocity of the airflow. In at least one aircraft  installation, both the shock method and the variable-geometry  method of causing diffusion are used in combination. The  same device that changes the area of the duct also sets up a  shock wave that further reduces the speed of the incoming  air within the duct. The amount of change in duct area and  the magnitude of the shock are varied automatically with the  airspeed of the aircraft.

# Compressor Inlet Screens  

To prevent the engine from readily ingesting any items that  can be drawn in the intake, a compressor inlet screen is  sometimes placed across the engine air inlet at some location  along the inlet duct. Engines that incorporate inlet screens,  such as turboprops  [Figure 3-28]  and APUs  [Figure 3-29]  are  not as vulnerable to FOD. The advantages and disadvantages  of a screen vary. If the engine is readily subjected to internal  damage, as would be the case for an engine having an axial  compressor fitted with aluminum compressor blades, an  inlet screen is almost a necessity. Screens, however, add  appreciably to inlet duct pressure loss and are very susceptible  to icing. Failure due to fatigue is also a problem. A failed   screen can sometimes cause more damage than no screen  at all. In some instances, inlet screens are made retractable  and may be withdrawn from the airstream after takeoff or  whenever icing conditions prevail. Such screens are subject  to mechanical failure and add both weight and bulk to  the installation. In large turbofan engines having steel or  titanium compressor (fan) blades, which do not damage

Figure 3-29.   An example of an inlet screen on an APU.  

easily, the disadvantages of compressor screens outweigh  the advantages, so they are not generally used.  

# Bellmouth Compressor Inlets  

A bellmouth inlet is usually installed on an engine undergoing  testing in a test cell. For this reason, the bellmouth inlet duct  is most often used on helicopter airframes.  [Figure 3-30]   It is generally equipped with probes that, with the use of  instruments, can measure intake temperature and pressure  (total and static).  [Figure 3-31]  During testing, it is important  that the outside static air is allowed to flow into the engine  with as little resistance as possible. The bellmouth is attached  to the movable part of the test stand and moves with the  engine. The thrust stand is made up of two components,  one nonmoving and one moving. This is so the moving  component can push against a load cell and measure thrust  during the testing of the engine. The bellmouth is designed  with the single objective of obtaining very high aerodynamic  efficiency. Essentially, the inlet is a bell-shaped funnel  having carefully rounded shoulders which offer practically  no air resistance.  [Figure 3-30]  Duct loss is so slight that it

Figure 3-31.   Probes within a bellmouth inlet used to measure intake  temperature and pressure.  

is considered zero. The engine can, therefore, be operated  without the complications resulting from losses common  to an installed aircraft inlet duct. Engine performance data,  such as rated thrust and thrust specific fuel consumption, are  obtained while using a bellmouth inlet. Usually, the inlets are  fitted with protective screening. In this case, the efficiency  lost as the air passes through the screen must be taken into  account when very accurate engine data are necessary.  

# Turboprop & Turboshaft Compressor Inlets  

The air inlet on a turboprop is more of a problem than some  other gas turbine engines because the propeller drive shaft,  the hub, and the spinner must be considered in addition to  other inlet design factors. The ducted arrangement is generally  considered the best inlet design of the turboprop engine as  far as airflow and aerodynamic characteristics are concerned.  [Figure 3-32]  The inlet for many types of turboprops are  anti-iced by using electrical elements in the lip opening of  the intake. Ducting either part of the engine or nacelle directs  the airflow to the intake of the engine. Deflector doors are  sometimes used to deflect ice or dirt away from the intake.  [Figure 3-33]  The air then passes through a screen and into  the engine on some models. A conical spinner, which does  not allow ice to build up on the surface, is sometimes used  with turboprop and turbofan engines. In either event, the  arrangement of the spinner and the inlet duct plays an important  function in the operation and performance of the engine.  

# Turbofan Engine Inlet Sections  

High-bypass turbofan engines are usually constructed with  the fan at the forward end of the compressor. A typical  turbofan intake section is shown in  Figure 3-34.  Sometimes,  the inlet cowl is bolted to the front of the engine and provides  the airflow path into the engine. In dual compressor (dual  spool) engines, the fan is integral with the relatively slow- turning, low-pressure compressor, which allows the fan

blades to rotate at low tip speed for best fan efficiency. The  fan permits the use of a conventional air inlet duct, resulting  in low inlet duct loss. The fan reduces engine damage from  ingested foreign material because much of any material  that may be ingested is thrown radially outward and passes  through the fan discharge rather than through the core of  the engine. Warm bleed air is drawn from the engine and  circulated on the inside of the inlet lip for anti-icing. The  fan hub or spinner is either heated by warm air or is conical  as mentioned earlier. Inside the inlet by the fan blade tips is  an abraidable rub strip that allows the fan blades to rub for  short times due to flightpath changes.  [Figure 3-35]  Also,  inside the inlet are sound-reducing materials to lower the  noise generated by the fan.  

The fan on high-bypass engines consists of one stage  of rotating blades and stationary vanes that can range in  diameter from less than 84 inches to more than 112 inches.  [Figure 3-36]  The fan blades are either hollow titanium or  composite materials. The air accelerated by the outer part of  

![](images/3a7071bdc4fc8d79a2e4c19f403a4bc55a96ac1b793e7f843e97173f24c8b8d7.jpg)  
Figure 3-35.   Rubber stripping inside a turbofan engine inlet allows  for friction for short periods of time during changes in the flightpath.  

the fan blades forms a secondary airstream, which is ducted  overboard without passing through the main engine. This  secondary air (fan flow) produces 80 percent of the thrust in  high-bypass engines. The air that passes through the inner  part of the fan blades becomes the primary airstream (core  flow) through the engine itself.  [Figure 3-36]  

The air from the fan exhaust, which is ducted overboard, may  be discharged in either of two ways:  

1.	 To the outside air through short ducts (dual exhaust  nozzles) directly behind the fan.  [Figure 3-37] 2.	 Ducted fan, which uses closed ducts all the way to the  rear of the engine, where it is exhausted to the outside  air through a mixed exhaust nozzle. This type engine  is called a ducted fan and the core airflow and fan  airflow mix in a common exhaust nozzle.

# Reciprocating Engine Exhaust Systems  

The reciprocating engine exhaust system is fundamentally  a scavenging system that collects and disposes of the high  temperature, noxious gases being discharged by the engine.  Its main function is to dispose of the gases with complete  safety to the airframe and the occupants of the aircraft. The  exhaust system can perform many useful functions, but its  first duty is to provide protection against the potentially  destructive action of the exhaust gases. Modern exhaust  systems, though comparatively light, adequately resist high  temperatures, corrosion, and vibration to provide long,  trouble-free operation with minimum maintenance.  

There are two general types of exhaust systems in use on  reciprocating aircraft engines: the short stack (open) system  and the collector system. The short stack system is generally  used on nonsupercharged engines and low-powered engines  where noise level is not too objectionable. The collector system  is used on most large nonsupercharged engines and on all  turbo supercharged engines and installations on which it would  improve nacelle streamlining or provide easier maintenance in  the nacelle area. On turbo supercharged engines, the exhaust  gases must be collected to drive the turbine compressor of the  supercharger. Such systems have individual exhaust headers  that empty into a common collector ring with only one outlet.  From this outlet, the hot exhaust gas is routed via a tailpipe  to the turbosupercharger that drives the turbine. Although the  collector system raises the back pressure of the exhaust system,  the gain in horsepower from turbo supercharging more than  offsets the loss in horsepower that results from increased back  pressure. The short stack system is relatively simple, and its  removal and installation consists essentially of removing and  installing the hold-down nuts and clamps. Short stack systems  have limited use on most modern aircraft.  

In  Figure 3-38,  the location of typical collector exhaust  

![](images/a7acf5f607fc3e105b4dcf3b62fe7589b8b08b61e2a86966b72c0ffac15a62e0.jpg)

system components of a horizontally opposed engine is  shown in a side view. The exhaust system in this installation  consists of a down-stack from each cylinder, an exhaust  collector tube on each side of the engine, and an exhaust  ejector assembly protruding aft and down from each side of  the firewall. The down-stacks are connected to the cylinders
 with high temperature locknuts and secured to the exhaust  collector tube by ring clamps. A cabin heater exhaust shroud  is installed around each collector tube.  [Figure 3-39]  

The collector tubes terminate at the exhaust ejector openings  at the firewall and are tapered to deliver the exhaust gases  at the proper velocity to induce airflow through the exhaust

ejectors. The exhaust ejectors consist of a throat-and-duct  assembly that utilizes the pumping action of the exhaust  gases to induce a flow of cooling air through all parts of the  engine compartment (augmenter tube action).  

# Radial Engine Exhaust Collector Ring System  

Figure 3-40  shows the exhaust collector ring installed on  a 14-cylinder radial engine. The collector ring is a welded  corrosion-resistant steel assembly manufactured in seven  sections, with each section collecting the exhaust from two  cylinders. The sections are graduated in size.  [Figure 3-41] The small sections are on the inboard side, and the largest  sections are on the outboard side at the point where the tailpipe  connects to the collector ring. Each section of the collector  ring is bolted to a bracket on the blower section of the engine  and is partly supported by a sleeve connection between the  collector ring ports and the short stack on the engine exhaust  ports. The exhaust tailpipe is joined to the collector ring by a  telescoping expansion joint, which allows enough slack for the  removal of segments of the collector ring without removing  the tailpipe. The exhaust tailpipe is a welded, corrosion- resistant steel assembly consisting of the exhaust tailpipe and,  on some aircraft, a muff-type heat exchanger.  

# Manifold & Augmentor Exhaust Assembly  

Some radial engines are equipped with a combination  exhaust manifold and augmentor assembly. On a typical  18-cylinder engine, two exhaust assemblies and two  augmentor assemblies are used. Each manifold assembly  collects exhaust gases from nine cylinders and discharges the  gases into the forward end of the augmentor assembly. The  exhaust gases are directed into the augmentor bellmouths.  The augmentors are designed to produce a venturi effect to  draw an increased airflow over the engine to augment engine  

![](images/7e48ee7fbd6af457ca291096e32f30c2b9ba715c436c4dac4a26d5c68357a9b6.jpg)

cooling. An augmentor vane is located in each tailpipe. When  the vane is fully closed, the cross-sectional area of the tailpipe  is reduced by approximately 45 percent. The augmentor  vanes are operated by an electrical actuator, and indicators  adjacent to the augmentor vane switches in the flight deck  show vane positions. The vanes may be moved toward the  “closed” position to decrease the velocity of flow through  the augmentor to raise the engine temperature. This system is  only used with older aircraft that generally use radial engines.  

# Reciprocating Engine Exhaust System Maintenance  Practices  

Any exhaust system failure should be regarded as a severe  hazard. Depending on the location and type of failure,  an exhaust system failure can result in carbon monoxide  poisoning of crew and passengers, partial or complete loss  of engine power, or an aircraft fire. Cracks in components,  leaking gaskets, or complete failure can cause serious  problems in flight. Often, these failures can be detected  before complete failure. Black soot around an exhaust gasket  shows the gasket has failed. The exhaust system should be  inspected very thoroughly.  

# Exhaust System Inspection  

While the type and location of exhaust system components  vary somewhat with the type of aircraft, the inspection  requirements for most reciprocating engine exhaust systems  are very similar. The following paragraphs include a  discussion of the most common exhaust system inspection  items and procedures for all reciprocating engines.  Figure 3-42  shows the primary inspection areas of three  types of exhaust systems.  

When performing maintenance on exhaust systems, never use  galvanized or zinc-plated tools on the exhaust system. Exhaust  system parts should never be marked with a lead pencil. The  lead, zinc, or galvanized mark is absorbed by the metal of the  exhaust system when heated, creating a distinct change in its  molecular structure. This change softens the metal in the area  of the mark, causing cracks and eventual failure.  

After the installation of a complete exhaust system and all  pieces of engine cowl are installed and secured, the engine  should be operated to allow the exhaust system to heat up  to normal operating temperatures. The engine is then shut  

![](images/f4ea492f6ae2e12f4a95096813e69f5feeeb7c303dc15899e2f9112dce70dda1.jpg)  
Figure 3-42.   Primary inspection areas of three types of exhaust  systems.  

down and the cowling removed to expose the exhaust system.  Each clamped connection and each exhaust port connection  should be inspected for evidence of exhaust gas leakage.  

An exhaust leak is indicated by a flat gray or a sooty black  streak on the pipes in the area of the leak. An exhaust leak  is usually the result of poor alignment of two mated exhaust  system members. When a leaking exhaust connection is  discovered, the clamps should be loosened, and the leaking  units repositioned to ensure a gas-tight fit.  

After repositioning, the system nuts should be retightened  enough to eliminate any looseness without exceeding the  specified torque. If tightening to the specified torque does  not eliminate looseness, the bolts and nuts should be replaced  since they have probably stretched. After tightening to the  specified torque, all nuts should be safetied. With the cowling  removed, all necessary cleaning operations can be performed.  Some exhaust units are manufactured with a plain sandblast  finish. Others may have a ceramic-coated finish. Ceramic- coated stacks should be cleaned by degreasing only. They  should never be cleaned with sandblast or alkali cleaners.  

During the inspection of an exhaust system, close attention  should be given to all external surfaces of the exhaust system  for cracks, dents, or missing parts. This also applies to welds,  clamps, supports, support attachment lugs, bracing, slip joints,  stack flanges, gaskets, and flexible couplings. Each bend  should be examined, as well as areas adjacent to welds. Any  dented areas or low spots in the system should be inspected  for thinning and pitting due to internal erosion by combustion  products or accumulated moisture. An ice pick or similar  pointed instrument is useful in probing suspected areas.  

The system should be disassembled as necessary to inspect  internal baffles or diffusers. If a component of the exhaust  system is inaccessible for a thorough visual inspection or is  hidden by nonremovable parts, it should be removed and  checked for possible leaks. This can often be accomplished  best by plugging the openings of the component, applying  a suitable internal pressure (approximately 2 psi), and  submerging it in water. Any leaks cause bubbles that  can readily be detected. The procedures required for an  installation inspection are also performed during most regular  inspections. Daily inspection of the exhaust system usually  consists of checking the exposed exhaust system for cracks,  scaling, excessive leakage, and loose clamps.  

# Muffler & Heat Exchanger Failures  

Approximately half of all muffler and heat exchanger failures  can be traced to cracks or ruptures in the heat exchanger  surfaces used for cabin and carburetor heat sources. Failures  in the heat exchanger surface (usually in the outer wall) allow  exhaust gases to escape directly into the cabin heat system.  These failures, in most cases, are caused by thermal and  vibration fatigue cracking in areas of stress concentration.  Failure of the spot-welds, which attach the heat transfer pins,  can result in exhaust gas leakage. In addition to a carbon  monoxide hazard, failure of heat exchanger surfaces can  permit exhaust gases to be drawn into the engine induction  system, causing engine overheating and power loss.  

# Exhaust Manifold & Stack Failures  

Exhaust manifold and stack failures are usually fatigue  failures at welded or clamped points (e.g., stack-to-flange,  stack-to-manifold, and crossover pipe or muffler connections).  Although these failures are primarily fire hazards, they also  present carbon monoxide problems. Exhaust gases can  enter the cabin via defective or inadequate seals at firewall  openings, wing strut fittings, doors, and wing root openings.  

# Internal Muffler Failures  

Internal failures (baffles, diffusers, etc.) can cause partial or  complete engine power loss by restricting the flow of the  exhaust gases. If pieces of the internal baffling breaks loose  and partially or totally blocks the flow of exhaust gases,  engine failure can occur.  [Figure 3-43]  As opposed to other  failures, erosion and carburization caused by the extreme  thermal conditions are the primary causes of internal failures.  Engine backfiring and combustion of unburned fuel within the  exhaust system are probable contributing factors. In addition,  local hot-spot areas caused by uneven exhaust gas flow can  result in burning, bulging, or rupture of the outer muffler wall.  

![](images/1f0376981c381e7f098c81124e55bc2534abdbb223fc2a23fb31d29bbfdcd650.jpg)  
Figure 3-43.   An example of internal muffler failure. Muffler failure  can be caused by erosion and carbonization, which in turn can lead  to breakage blocking exhaust flow.  

# Exhaust Systems with Turbocharger  

When a turbocharger or a turbosupercharger system is  included, the engine exhaust system operates under greatly  increased pressure and temperature conditions. Extra  precautions should be taken in exhaust system care and  maintenance. During high-pressure altitude operation, the  exhaust system pressure is maintained at or near sea level  values. Due to the pressure differential, any leaks in the system  allow the exhaust gases to escape with torch-like intensity  that can severely damage adjacent structures. A common  cause of malfunction is coke deposits (carbon buildup) in the  waste gate unit causing erratic system operation. Excessive  deposit buildups may cause the waste gate valve to stick in  the “closed” position, causing an overboost condition. Coke  deposit buildup in the turbo itself causes a gradual loss of  power in flight and low manifold pressure reading prior to  takeoff. Experience has shown that periodic de-coking, or  removal of carbon deposits, is necessary to maintain peak  efficiency. Clean, repair, overhaul, and adjust the system  components and controls in accordance with the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Augmentor Exhaust System  

On exhaust systems equipped with augmentor tubes, the  augmentor tubes should be inspected at regular intervals for  proper alignment, security of attachment, and general overall  condition. Even where augmentor tubes do not contain heat  exchanger surfaces, they should be inspected for cracks  along with the remainder of the exhaust system. Cracks  in augmentor tubes can present a fire or carbon monoxide  hazard by allowing exhaust gases to enter the nacelle, wing,  or cabin areas.  

# Exhaust System Repairs  

It is generally recommended that exhaust stacks, mufflers,  tailpipes, etc., be replaced with new or reconditioned  components rather than repaired. Welded repairs to exhaust  systems are complicated by the difficulty of accurately  identifying the base metal so that the proper repair materials  can be selected. Changes in composition and grain structure  of the original base metal further complicate the repair.  However, when welded repairs are necessary, the original  contours should be retained; the exhaust system alignment  must not be warped or otherwise affected. Repairs or sloppy  weld beads that protrude internally are not acceptable as they  cause local hot spots and may restrict exhaust gas flow. The  proper hardware and clamps should always be used when  repairing or replacing exhaust system components. Steel or  low temperature, self-locking nuts should not be substituted  for brass or special high temperature locknuts used by the  manufacturer. Old gaskets should never be re-used. When  disassembly is necessary, gaskets should be replaced with  new ones of the same type provided by the manufacturer.  

# Turbine Engine Exhaust Nozzles  

Turbine engines have several different types of exhaust  nozzles depending upon the type of engine. Turboshaft  engines in helicopters can have an exhaust nozzle that forms  a divergent duct. This type of nozzle would not provide any  thrust, all engine power going to rotate the rotors, improving  helicopter hovering abilities. Turbofan engines tend to fall  into either ducted fan of unducted fan engines. Ducted fan  engines take the fan airflow and direct it through closed  ducts along the engine. Then, it flows into a common exhaust  nozzle. The core exhaust flow and the fan flow mix and flow  from the engine through this mixed nozzle. The unducted fan  has two nozzles, one for the fan airflow and one for the core  airflow. These both flow to ambient air separate from each  other and have separate nozzles.  [Figure 3-44]  

The unducted engine or the separate nozzle engine handles  high amounts of airflow. The fan air which creates most of the  thrust (80–85 percent total thrust) must be directed through  the fan blades and exit vanes with little turbulence as possible.  [Figure 3-45]  The core airflow needs to be straightened as  it comes from the turbine. Through the use of a converging  nozzle, the exhaust gases increase in velocity before they are  discharged from the exhaust nozzle. Increasing the velocity of  the gases increases their momentum and increases the thrust  produced (20–15 percent total thrust). Most of the energy of  the gases have been absorbed to drive the fan through the  low-pressure turbine stages.  

Turboprop exhaust nozzles provide small amounts of thrust  (10–15 percent) but are mainly used to discharge the exhaust  gases from the aircraft. Most of the energy has been transferred  to the propeller. On some turboprop aircraft, an exhaust duct  is often referred to as a tailpipe, although the duct itself is  

![](images/0822c60f74b2e1b4bb4d1be74e2574a09c62f9fe8ebbddd0e14eb534075e3ffc.jpg)

essentially a simple, stainless steel, conical or cylindrical pipe.  The assembly also includes an engine tail cone and the struts  inside the duct. The tail cone and the struts add strength to  the duct, impart an axial direction to the gas flow, and smooth  the gas flow. In a typical installation, the tailpipe assembly is  mounted in the nacelle and attached at its forward end to the  firewall. The forward section of the tailpipe is funnel shaped  and surrounds but does not contact the turbine exhaust section.  This arrangement forms an annular gap that serves as an air  ejector for the air surrounding the engine hot section. As the  high-velocity exhaust gases enter the tailpipe, a low-pressure  effect is produced which causes the air around the engine hot  section to flow through the annular gap into the tailpipe. The  rear section of the tailpipe is secured to the airframe by two  support arms, one on each side of the tailpipe. The support  arms are attached to the upper surface of the wing in such  

![](images/abae6d68142c632164b4b92df996788acc65ecee0e69ee570c17e928026d6a63.jpg)

a way that allow movement fore and aft to compensate for  expansion. The tailpipe assembly is wrapped in an insulating  blanket to shield the surrounding area from the high heat  produced by the exhaust gases. Such blankets may be made of  a stainless steel laminated sheet on the outside and fiberglass  on the inside. This is used when the engine exhaust is located  some distance from the edge of the wing or aircraft structure.  

Immediately aft of the turbine outlet, and usually just forward  of the flange to which the exhaust duct is attached, the engine  is instrumented for turbine discharge pressure. One or more  pressure probes are inserted into the exhaust duct to provide  adequate sampling of the exhaust gases. In large engines,  it is not practical to measure the internal temperature at the  turbine inlet, so the engine is often also instrumented for  exhaust gas temperature at the turbine outlet.  

# Convergent Exhaust Nozzle  

As the exhaust gases exit the rear of the engine, they flow  into the exhaust nozzle.  [Figure 3-46]  The very first part of  the exhaust nozzle and the exhaust plug form a divergent duct  to reduce turbulence in the airflow, then the exhaust gases  flow into the convergent component of the exhaust nozzle  where the flow is restricted by a smaller outlet opening. Since  this forms a convergent duct, the gas velocity is increased  providing increased thrust. The restriction of the opening of  the outlet of the exhaust nozzle is limited by two factors. If  the nozzle opening is too big, thrust is being wasted. If it is  too little, the flow is choked in the other components of the  engine. In other words, the exhaust nozzle acts as an orifice,  the size of which determines the density and velocity of  the gases as they emerge from the engine. This is critical to  thrust performance. Adjusting the area of the exhaust nozzle  changes both the engine performance and the exhaust gas  temperature. When the velocity of the exhaust gases at the  

![](images/7ac7b9f161e322d4d7ae23ba1afc3dd960d933ca8284e2a141cb2deee4f03886.jpg)  
Figure 3-46.   Exhaust gases exit the rear of the engine through the  exhaust nozzle.  

nozzle opening becomes Mach 1, the flow passes only at this  speed—it does not increase or decrease. Sufficient flow to  maintain Mach 1 at the nozzle opening and have extra flow  (flow that is being restricted by the opening) creates what  is called a choked nozzle. The extra flow builds up pressure  in the nozzle, which is sometimes called pressure thrust. A  differential in pressure exists between the inside of the nozzle  and the ambient air. By multiplying this difference in pressure  times the area of the nozzle opening, pressure thrust can be  calculated. Many engines cannot develop pressure thrust  because most of the energy is used to drive turbines that turn  propellers, large fans, or helicopter rotors.  

# Convergent-Divergent Exhaust Nozzle  

Whenever the engine pressure ratio is high enough to produce  exhaust gas velocities which might exceed Mach 1 at the  engine exhaust nozzle, more thrust can be gained by using  a convergent-divergent type of nozzle.  [Figure 3-47]  The  advantage of a convergent-divergent nozzle is greatest at  high Mach numbers because of the resulting higher pressure  ratio across the engine exhaust nozzle.  

To ensure that a constant weight or volume of a gas flows past  any given point after sonic velocity is reached, the rear part  of a supersonic exhaust duct is enlarged to accommodate the  additional weight or volume of a gas that flows at supersonic  rates. If this is not done, the nozzle does not operate efficiently.  This is the divergent section of the exhaust duct.  

When a divergent duct is used in combination with a  conventional exhaust duct, it is called a convergent-divergent  exhaust duct. In the convergent-divergent, or C-D nozzle, the  convergent section is designed to handle the gases while they  remain subsonic, and to deliver the gases to the throat of the  nozzle just as they attain sonic velocity. The divergent section  

![](images/2c0ab5fcc4241d62ed592635452ac443594c6d1c8a52f1b42ff89f008de7a694.jpg)  
Figure 3-47.   A convergent-divergent nozzle can be used to help  produce more thrust when exhaust gas velocities are greater than  Mach 1.  

handles the gases, further increasing their velocity, after they  emerge from the throat and become supersonic. As the gas  flows from the throat of the nozzle, it becomes supersonic  (Mach 1 and above) and then passes into the divergent section  of the nozzle. Since it is supersonic, it continues to increase  in velocity. This type of nozzle is generally used on very high  speed aerospace vehicles.  

# Thrust Reversers  

As aircraft have increased in gross weights with higher  landing airspeeds, the problem of stopping an aircraft after  landing has greatly increased. In many instances, the aircraft  brakes can no longer be relied upon solely to slow the aircraft  within a reasonable distance, immediately after touchdown.  Most thrust reverser systems can be divided into two  categories: mechanical-blockage and aerodynamic-blockage. Mechanical blockage is accomplished by placing a removable  obstruction in the exhaust gas stream, usually somewhat to the  rear of the nozzle. The engine exhaust gases are mechanically  blocked and diverted at a suitable angle in the reverse  direction by an inverted cone, half-sphere, or clam shell.  [Figure 3-48]  This is placed in position to reverse the flow of  exhaust gases. This type is generally used with ducted turbofan  engines, where the fan and core flow mix in a common nozzle  before exiting the engine. The clamshell-type or mechanical- blockage reverser operates to form a barrier in the path of  escaping exhaust gases, which nullifies and reverses the  forward thrust of the engine. The reverser system must be  able to withstand high temperatures, be mechanically strong,  relatively light in weight, reliable, and “fail-safe.” When not  in use, it must be streamlined into the configuration of the  engine nacelle. When the reverser is not in use, the clamshell  doors retract and nest neatly around the engine exhaust duct,  usually forming the rear section of the engine nacelle.  

In the aerodynamic blockage type of thrust reverser, used  mainly with unducted turbofan engines, only fan air is used  to slow the aircraft. A modern aerodynamic thrust reverser  system consists of a translating cowl, blocker doors, and  cascade vanes that redirect the fan airflow to slow the  aircraft.  [Figure 3-49]  If the thrust levers are at idle position  and the aircraft has weight on the wheels, moving the thrust  levers aft activates the translating cowl to open, closing the  blocker doors. This action stops the fan airflow from going  aft and redirects it through the cascade vanes, which direct  the airflow forward to slow the aircraft. Since the fan can  produce approximately 80 percent of the engine’s thrust,  the fan is the best source for reverse thrust. By returning the  thrust levers (power levers) to the idle position, the blocker  doors open and the translating cowl closes.  

A thrust reverser must not have any adverse effect on engine  operation either deployed or stowed. Generally, there is  

![](images/8a21e5fd83bae96e01a095f2128899b2c926c18a315fc08c0faffcdf82674da8.jpg)  
Figure 3-48.   Engine exhaust gases are blocked and diverted in a  reserve direction during thrust reversal.  

an indication in the flight deck with regard to the status of  the reverser system. The thrust reverser system consists of  several components that move either the clam shell doors  or the blocker door and translating cowl. Actuating power  is generally pneumatic or hydraulic and uses gearboxes,  flexdrives, screwjacks, control valves, and air or hydraulic  motors to deploy or stow the thrust reverser systems. The  systems are locked in the stowed position until commanded to  deploy by the flight deck. Since there are several moving parts,  maintenance and inspection requirements are very important.  While performing any type of maintenance, the reverser  system must be mechanically locked out from deploying while  personnel are in the area of the reverser system.  

# Afterburning/Thrust Augmentation  

The terms afterburning and thrust augmentation generally  pertain to military engine applications. The terms are used to  describe the same system. Normally, this is used to increase  the thrust of the engine up to double the original thrust. The  required additions to the exhaust nozzle for this system are  a flame stabilizer, fuel manifold, flame holder, igniter, and a  

![](images/e0e49ff56b94063beb0ab74c11b95995200f75d7a748953e21f44af08e87aa55.jpg)  
Figure 3-49.   Components of a thrust reverser system.  

variable area exhaust nozzle.  [Figure 3-50]  After the engine  has reached full power under normal operation, the power  lever can be advanced to activate the afterburner. This allows  more fuel to flow into the exhaust nozzle where it is ignited  and burned. As energy and mass are added to the gas flow,  the exhaust nozzle must open wider to allow greater flow.  As the power lever is moved back out of the afterburner, the  exhaust nozzle closes down again. Some low-bypass turbofan  engines used in military aircraft use bypass (fan air) to flow  into the exhaust nozzle. Just as in a ducted fan, this air is  used in the afterburner. It contains more oxygen and assists  combustion in the afterburner. Since fuel is being burned in  the exhaust nozzle, the heat buildup around the nozzle is a  problem. A special type of liner is used around the nozzle to  allow cooler air to circulate around the nozzle. This operates  somewhat like a single burner can combustion chamber.  Operation in the afterburner mode is somewhat limited by  high fuel consumption, which can be almost double normal  consumption.  

# Thrust Vectoring  

Thrust vectoring is the ability of an aircraft’s main engines to  direct thrust other than parallel to the vehicle’s longitudinal  axis, allowing the exhaust nozzle to move or change position  to direct the thrust in varied directions. Vertical takeoff  aircraft use thrust vectoring as takeoff thrust and then change  direction to propel the aircraft in horizontal flight. Military  aircraft use thrust vectoring for maneuvering in flight to  change direction. Thrust vectoring is generally accomplished  by relocating the direction of the exhaust nozzle to direct the  thrust to move the aircraft in the desired path. At the rear of  a gas turbine engine, a nozzle directs the flow of hot exhaust  gases out of the engine and afterburner. Usually, the nozzle  points straight out of the engine. The pilot can move, or  vector, the vectoring nozzle up and down by  $20^{\circ}$  . This makes  the aircraft much more maneuverable in flight.  [Figure 3-51]  

![](images/eaecf3d34d534799c6bb52589181e703db85c08975142b5a485ce72ed53917f9.jpg)

Figure 3-51.   A pilot can direct thrust via the vectoring nozzle  $20^{\circ}$  up or down to increase flight maneuverability.  

# Engine Noise Suppression  

Aircraft powered by gas turbine engines sometimes require  noise suppression for the engine exhaust gases when  operating from airports located in or near highly populated  areas. Several types of noise suppressors are used. A common  type of noise suppressor is an integral, airborne part of the  aircraft engine installation or engine exhaust nozzle. Engine  noise comes from several sources on the engine, the fan, or  compressor and the air discharge from the core of the engine.  There are three sources of noise involved in the operation  of a gas turbine engine. The engine air intake and vibration  from engine housing are sources of some noise, but the  noise   generated does not compare in magnitude with that  produced by the engine exhaust.  [Figure 3-52]  The noise  produced by the engine exhaust is caused by the high degree  of turbulence of a high-velocity jet stream moving through  a relatively quiet atmosphere. For a distance of a few nozzle  diameters downstream behind the engine, the velocity of the  jet stream is high, and there is little mixing of the atmosphere  with the jet stream. In this region, the turbulence within  the high speed jet stream is very fine grain turbulence and  produces relatively high-frequency noise. This noise is caused  by violent, turbulent mixing of the exhaust gases with the  atmosphere and is influenced by the shearing action caused by  the relative speeds between the velocity and the atmosphere.  

Farther downstream, as the velocity of the jet stream  slows down, the jet stream mixes with the atmosphere and  turbulence of a coarser type begins. Compared with noise  from other portions of the jet stream, noise from this portion  has a much lower frequency. As the energy of the jet stream  finally is dissipated in large turbulent swirls, a greater portion  of the energy is converted into noise. The noise generated as  the exhaust gases dissipate is at a frequency near the low end  of the audible range. The lower the frequency of the noise,  

![](images/8d5ddd4c53c61e1aa6f9359e3cb5b9ef5d65a4e236be4a9d045274c8cec056be.jpg)  
Figure 3-52.   Engine noise from engine exhaust is created by the turbulence of a high velocity jet stream moving through the relatively  quiet atmosphere.  

the greater the distance the noise travels. This means that the  low-frequency noises reach an individual on the ground in  greater volume than the high-frequency noises, and hence  are more objectionable. High-frequency noise is weakened  more rapidly than low-frequency noise, both by distance  and the interference of buildings, terrain, and atmospheric  disturbances. A deep-voiced, low-frequency foghorn, for  example, may be heard much farther than a shrill, high- frequency whistle, even though both may have the same  overall volume (decibels) at their source.  

Noise levels vary with engine thrust and are proportional  to the amount of work done by the engine on the air that  passes through it. An engine having relatively low airflow  but high thrust due to high turbine discharge (exhaust gas)  temperature, pressure, and/or afterburning produces a gas  stream of high velocity and, therefore, high noise levels. A  larger engine, handling more air, is quieter at the same thrust  and large engines operating at partial thrust are less noisy than  smaller engines operating at full thrust. Thus, the noise level  can be reduced considerably by operating the engine at lower  power settings. Compared with a turbojet, a turbofan version  of the same engine is quieter during takeoff. The noise level  produced by a fan-type engine is lower, principally because  the exhaust gas velocities ejected at the engine tailpipe are  slower than those for a turbojet of comparative size.  

Fan engines require a larger turbine to provide additional  power to drive the fan. The large turbine, which usually has  an additional turbine stage, reduces the velocity of the gas  and, therefore, reduces the noise produced because exhaust  gas noise is proportional to exhaust gas velocity. The exhaust  from the fan is at a relatively low velocity and, therefore, does  not create a noise problem. Because of the characteristic of  low-frequency noise to linger at a relatively high volume,  effective noise reduction for a turbojet aircraft must be  achieved by revising the noise pattern or by changing the  frequency of the noise emitted by the jet nozzle.  

The noise suppressors in current use are either of the corrugated- perimeter type, or the multi-tube type.  [Figure 3-53]  Both  types of suppressors break up the single, main jet exhaust  stream into a number of smaller jet streams. This increases  the total perimeter of the nozzle area and reduces the size  of the air stream eddies created as the gases are discharged  into the open air. Although the total noise-energy remains  unchanged, the frequency is raised considerably. The size  of the air stream eddies scales down at a linear rate with  the size of the exhaust stream. This has two effects: 1) the  change in frequency may put some of the noise above the  audibility range of the human ear, and 2) high frequencies  

![](images/a801617d0348f3f264e0fcefd9cec1df281c5f2769a93e8e2477d474c1c36a17.jpg)  
Figure 3-53.   Noise suppressors currently in use are corrugated- perimeter type, or multi-tube type.  

within the audible range, while perhaps more annoying, are  more highly attenuated by atmospheric absorption than are  low frequencies. Thus, the falloff in intensity is greater and  the noise level is less at any given distance from the aircraft. In the engine nacelle, the area between the engine and the  cowl has acoustic linings surrounding the engine. This  noise-absorbing lining material converts acoustic energy  into heat. These linings normally consist of a porous skin  supported by a honeycomb backing and provide a separation  between the face sheet and the engine duct. For optimum  suppression, the acoustic properties of the skin and the liner  are carefully matched.  

# Turbine Engine Emissions  

Engineers are introducing new combustion technology that  has dramatically reduced emissions from gas turbine engines.  Lowering exhaust emissions from gas turbine, especially  oxides of nitrogen  $(\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{X}})$  , continue to require improvement.  Most of the research has centered around the combustion  section of the engine. New technology with unique combustor  design has greatly reduced emissions. One manufacturer  has a design called the Twin Annular, Pre-mixing Swirler  (TAPS) combustor. Most advanced designs rely on a method  of pre-mixing the air-fuel before it enters the combustion  burner area. In the TAPS design, air from the high-pressure  compressor is directed into the combustor through two high- energy swirlers adjacent to the fuel nozzles. This swirl creates  a more thorough and leaner mix of fuel and air, which burns  at lower temperatures than in previous gas turbine engine  designs. Most of the  $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{X}}$   is formed by the reaction of oxygen  and nitrogen at high temperatures. The  $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{X}}$   levels are higher  if the burning air-fuel mixture stays at high temperatures for a  longer time. Newly designed combustors also produce lower  levels of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons. The  increases in gas turbine engine component efficiencies have  resulted in fewer emissions from gas turbine engines.

# Reciprocating Engine Ignition Systems  

The basic requirements for reciprocating engine ignition  systems are similar, regardless of the type of engine. All  ignition systems must deliver a high-tension spark across the  electrodes of each spark plug in each cylinder of the engine  in the correct firing order. At a predetermined number of  degrees ahead of the top dead center position of the piston,  as measured by crankshaft travel in degrees of rotation, the  spark occurs in the cylinder. The potential output voltage of  the system must be adequate to arc the gap in the spark plug  electrodes under all operating conditions. The spark plug is  threaded into the cylinder head with the electrodes exposed  to the combustion area of the engine’s cylinder.  

Ignition systems can be divided into two classifications:  magneto-ignition systems or electronic Full Authority Digital  Engine Control (FADEC) systems for reciprocating engines.  Ignition systems can also be subclassified as either single or  dual magneto-ignition systems. The single magneto-ignition  system, usually consisting of one magneto and the necessary  wiring, was used with another single magneto on the same  engine. Dual magnetos generally use one rotating magnet  that feeds two complete magnetos in one magneto housing.  An example of each type is shown in  Figure 4-1 .  

Aircraft magneto-ignition systems can be classified as either  high-tension or low-tension. The low-tension magneto  system, covered in a later section of this chapter, generates a  low-voltage that is distributed to a transformer coil near each  spark plug. This system eliminates some problems inherent in  the high-tension system that was containing the high-voltage  until it passed through the spark plug. The materials that were  used for ignition leads could not withstand the high-voltage  

![](images/a6dad29e93c134deaf968ec2114c848b08d7bfa76bf661399f197dc83b65023b.jpg)

and were prone to leak to ground before the spark would get  to the cylinder. As new materials evolved and shielding was  developed, the problems with high-tension magnetos were  overcome. The high-tension magneto system is still the most  widely used aircraft ignition system.  

Some very old antique aircraft used a battery-ignition system.  In this system, the source of energy is a battery or generator,  rather than a magneto. This system was similar to that used in  most automobiles at the time.  Figure 4-2  shows a simplified  schematic of a battery-ignition system.  

# Magneto-Ignition System Operating  Principles  

The magneto, a special type of engine-driven alternating  current (AC) generator, uses a permanent magnet as a source  of energy. By the use of a permanent magnet (basic magnetic  field), coil of wire (concentrated lengths of conductor), and  relative movement of the magnetic field, current is generated  in the wire. At first, the magneto generates electrical power  by the engine rotating the permanent magnet and inducing  a current to flow in the coil windings. As current flows  through the coil windings, it generates its own magnetic  field that surrounds the coil windings. At the correct time,  this current flow is stopped and the magnetic field collapses  across a second set of windings in the coil and a high-voltage  is generated. This is the voltage used to arc across the spark  plug gap. In both cases, the three basic things needed to  generate electrical power are present to develop the high- voltage that forces a spark to jump across the spark plug gap  

![](images/76397be9b7bf490746ff753221caf781d4213285d0c6a283e5dcebb1cc391e8e.jpg)

in each cylinder. Magneto operation is timed to the engine  so that a spark occurs only when the piston is on the proper  stroke at a specified number of crankshaft degrees before the  top dead center piston position.  

# High-Tension Magneto System Theory of Operation  

The high-tension magneto system can be divided, for  purposes of discussion, into three distinct circuits: magnetic,  primary electrical, and secondary electrical circuits.  

# Magnetic Circuit  

The magnetic circuit consists of a permanent multi-pole  rotating magnet, a soft iron core, and pole shoes.  [Figure 4-3] The magnet is geared to the aircraft engine and rotates in the  gap between two pole shoes to furnish the magnetic lines of  force (flux) necessary to produce an electrical voltage. The  poles of the magnet are arranged in alternate polarity so that  the flux can pass out of the north pole through the coil core  and back to the south pole of the magnet. When the magnet is  in the position shown in  Figure 4-3A , the number of magnetic  lines of force through the coil core is maximum because two  magnetically opposite poles are perfectly aligned with the  pole shoes.  

This position of the rotating magnet is called the full register  position and produces a maximum number of magnetic lines  of force, flux flow clockwise through the magnetic circuit  and from left to right through the coil core. When the magnet  is moved away from the full register position, the amount of  flux passing through the coil core begins to decrease. This  occurs because the magnet’s poles are moving away from  the pole shoes, allowing some lines of flux to take a shorter  path through the ends of the pole shoes.  

As the magnet moves farther from the full register position,  more lines of flux are short circuited through the pole shoe  ends. Finally, at the neutral position  $45^{\circ}$   from the full register  position, all flux lines are short circuited, and no flux flows  through the coil core.  [Figure 4-3B]  As the magnet moves  from full register to the neutral position, the number of flux  lines through the coil core decreases in the same manner  as the gradual collapse of flux in the magnetic field of an  ordinary electromagnet.  

The neutral position of the magnet is where one of the poles  of the magnet is centered between the pole shoes of the  magnetic circuit. As the magnet is moved clockwise from  this position, the lines of flux that had been short circuited  through the pole shoe ends begin to flow through the coil  core again. But this time, the flux lines flow through the coil  core in the opposite direction.  [Figure 4-3C]  The flux flow  reverses as the magnet moves out of the neutral position  because the north pole of the rotating permanent magnet is  opposite the right pole shoe instead of the left.  [Figure 4-3A]  

When the magnet is again moved a total of  $90°$  , another full  register position is reached with a maximum flux flow in  the opposite direction. The  $90°$   of magnet travel is shown in  Figure 4-4,  where a curve shows how the flux density in the  coil core, without a primary coil around the core, changes  as the magnet is rotated.  

Figure 4-4  shows that as the magnet moves from the full  register position  $0^{\circ}$  , flux flow decreases and reaches a zero  value as it moves into the neutral position   $45^{\circ}$  . While the  magnet moves through the neutral position, flux flow reverses  and begins to increase as indicated by the curve below the  

![](images/0dba2f51901099de7bdfae4e88b1823aa1227e7b242df3b9725755359c2321ff.jpg)

horizontal line. At the   $90°$   position, another position of  maximum flux is reached. Thus, for one revolution  $360^{\circ}$   of  the four pole magnet, there are four positions of maximum  flux, four positions of zero flux, and four flux reversals.  

This discussion of the magnetic circuit demonstrates how the  coil core is affected by the rotating magnet. It is subjected to  an increasing and decreasing magnetic field and a change in  polarity each  $90°$   of magnet travel.  

When a coil of wire as part of the magneto’s primary electrical  circuit is wound around the coil core, it is also affected by  the varying magnetic field.  

# Primary Electrical Circuit  

The primary electrical circuit consists of a set of breaker  contact points, a condenser, and an insulated coil.  [Figure 4-5] The coil is made up of a few turns of heavy copper wire,  one end is grounded to the coil core and the other end to  the ungrounded side of the breaker points.  [Figure 4-5]  The  primary circuit is complete only when the ungrounded  breaker point contacts the grounded breaker point. The  third unit in the circuit, the condenser (capacitor), is wired  in parallel with the breaker points. The condenser prevents  arcing at the points when the circuit is opened and hastens  the collapse of the magnetic field about the primary coil.  

![](images/3c1655220821b04f59d2deba6f6fd0eb74ae0ecb44cb6176d17ab195a2132fc5.jpg)  
Figure 4-5.   Primary electrical circuit of a high-tension magneto.  

The primary breaker closes at approximately full register  position. When the breaker points are closed, the primary  electrical circuit is completed and the rotating magnet  induces current flow in the primary circuit. This current  flow generates its own magnetic field, which is in such a  direction that it opposes any change in the magnetic flux of  the permanent magnet’s circuit.  

While the induced current is flowing in the primary circuit,  it opposes any decrease in the magnetic flux in the core. This  is in accordance with Lenz’s Law that states: “An induced  current always flows in such a direction that its magnetism  opposes the motion or the change that induced it.” (For a  review of Lenz’s Law, refer to the Aviation Maintenance  Technician—General Handbook, FAA-H-8083-30). Thus,  the current flowing in the primary circuit holds the flux in  the core at a high value in one direction until the rotating  magnet has time to rotate through the neutral position to a  point a few degrees beyond neutral. This position is called  the E-gap position (E stands for efficiency).  

There are three basic events required to fire a spark plug  when its piston is in the prescribed position:  

1.	 the magneto must be in the E-gap position, 2.	 the breaker contact points must be open, and 3.	 the distributor must be aligned correctly.  

With the magnetic rotor in E-gap position and the primary  coil holding the magnetic field of the magnetic circuit in  the opposite polarity, a very high rate of flux change can be  obtained by opening the primary breaker points. Opening  the breaker points stops the flow of current in the primary  circuit and allows the magnetic rotor to quickly reverse the  field through the coil core. This sudden flux reversal produces  a high rate of flux change in the core, that cuts across the  secondary coil of the magneto (wound over and insulated  from the primary coil), inducing the pulse of high-voltage  electricity in the secondary needed to fire a spark plug. As  the rotor continues to rotate to approximately full register  position, the primary breaker points close again and the  cycle is repeated to fire the next spark plug in firing order.  The sequence of events can now be reviewed in greater detail  to explain how the state of extreme magnetic stress occurs.  

With the breaker points, cam, and condenser connected in  the circuit as shown in  Figure 4-6 , the action that takes place  as the magnetic rotor turns is depicted by the graph curve  in  Figure 4-7 . At the top (A) of  Figure 4-7 , the original  static flux curve of the magnets is shown. Shown below the  static flux curve is the sequence of opening and closing the  magneto breaker points. Note that opening and closing the  breaker points is timed by the breaker cam. The points close

Figure 4-6.   Components of a high-tension magneto circuit.  

when a maximum amount of flux is passing through the coil  core and open at a position after neutral. Since there are four  lobes on this particular cam (there are some magnetos with  cams that have only two lobes), the breaker points close and  open in the same relation to each of the four neutral positions  of the rotor magnet. Also, the point opening and point closing  intervals are approximately equal.  

Starting at the maximum flux position marked   $0^{\circ}$   at the  top of  Figure 4-7 , the sequence of events in the following  paragraphs occurs.  

As the magnet rotor is turned toward the neutral position,  the amount of flux through the core starts to decrease.  [Figure 4-7D]  This change in flux linkages induces a current  in the primary winding.  [Figure 4-7C]  This induced current  creates a magnetic field of its own that opposes the change of  flux linkages inducing the current. Without current flowing in  the primary coil, the flux in the coil core decreases to zero as  the magnet rotor turns to neutral and starts to increase in the  opposite direction (dotted static flux curve in  Figure 4-7D ).  But, the electromagnetic action of the primary current  prevents the flux from changing and temporarily holds the  field instead of allowing it to change (resultant flux line in  Figure 4-7D ).

Figure 4-8.   Pivotless type breaker assembly and cam.  

As a result of the holding process, there is a very high stress in  the magnetic circuit by the time the magnet rotor has reached  the position where the breaker points are about to open. The  breaker points, when opened, function with the condenser to  interrupt the flow of current in the primary coil, causing an  extremely rapid change in flux linkages. The high-voltage in  the secondary winding discharges across the gap in the spark  plug to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the engine cylinder. Each  spark actually consists of one peak discharge, after which a  series of small oscillations takes place.  

They continue to occur until the voltage becomes too low  to maintain the discharge. Current flows in the secondary  winding during the time that it takes for the spark to  completely discharge. The energy or stress in the magnetic  circuit is completely dissipated by the time the contacts close  for the production of the next spark. Breaker assemblies, used  in high-tension magneto-ignition systems, automatically open  and close the primary circuit at the proper time in relation  to piston position in the cylinder to which an ignition spark  is being furnished. The interruption of the primary current  flow is accomplished through a pair of breaker contact points  made of an alloy that resists pitting and burning.  

Most breaker points used in aircraft ignition systems are  of the pivotless type in which one of the breaker points is  movable and the other stationary.  [Figure 4-8]  The movable  breaker point attached to the leaf spring is insulated from  the magneto housing and is connected to the primary coil.  [Figure 4-8]  The stationary breaker point is grounded to the  magneto housing to complete the primary circuit when the  points are closed and can be adjusted so that the points can  open at the proper time.  

Another part of the breaker assembly is the cam follower,  which is spring-loaded against the cam by the metal leaf  spring. The cam follower is a Micarta block or similar material  that rides the cam and moves upward to force the movable  breaker contact away from the stationary breaker contact  each time a lobe of the cam passes beneath the follower. A  felt oiler pad is located on the underside of the metal spring  leaf to lubricate and prevent corrosion of the cam.  

The breaker-actuating cam may be directly driven by the  magneto rotor shaft or through a gear train from the rotor  shaft. Most large radial engines use a compensated cam that  is designed to operate with a specific engine and has one lobe  for each cylinder to be fired by the magneto. The cam lobes  are machine ground at unequal intervals to compensate for  the elliptical path of the articulated connecting rods. This  path causes the pistons top dead center position to vary  from cylinder to cylinder with regard to crankshaft rotation.  A compensated 14-lobe cam, together with a two-, four-,  and eight-lobe uncompensated cam, is shown in  Figure 4-9 .  

The unequal spacing of the compensated cam lobes, although  it provides the same relative piston position for ignition  to occur, causes a slight variation of the E-gap position of  the rotating magnet and thus a slight variation in the high- voltage impulses generated by the magneto. Since the spacing  between each lobe is tailored to a particular cylinder of a  particular engine, compensated cams are marked to show  

![](images/1b26a9800a51672ec266d62d4c0fde177fdf42ac3c429eb00de016d8bc0d08b5.jpg)

the series of the engine, the location of the master rods, the  lobe used for magneto timing, the direction of cam rotation,  and the E-gap specification in degrees past neutral of magnet  rotation. In addition to these markings, a step is cut across  the face of the cam, that, when aligned with scribed marks  on the magneto housing, places the rotating magnet in the  E-gap position for the timing cylinder. Since the breaker  points should begin to open when the rotating magnet moves  into the E-gap position, alignment of the step on the cam with  marks in the housing provides a quick and easy method of  establishing the exact E-gap position to check and adjust the  breaker points.  

# Secondary Electrical Circuit  

The secondary circuit contains the secondary windings of the  coil, distributor rotor, distributor cap, ignition lead, and spark  plug. The secondary coil is made up of a winding containing  approximately 13,000 turns of fine, insulated wire; one end  of which is electrically grounded to the primary coil or to  the coil core and the other end connected to the distributor  rotor. The primary and secondary coils are encased in a non- conducting material. The whole assembly is then fastened to  the pole shoes with screws and clamps.  

When the primary circuit is closed, the current flow through  the primary coil produces magnetic lines of force that cut  across the secondary windings, inducing an electromotive  force. When the primary circuit current flow is stopped, the  magnetic field surrounding the primary windings collapses,  causing the secondary windings to be cut by the lines of  force. The strength of the voltage induced in the secondary  windings, when all other factors are constant, is determined  by the number of turns of wire. Since most high-tension  magnetos have many thousands of turns of wire in the  secondary coil windings, a very high-voltage, often as high  as 20,000 volts, is generated in the secondary circuit. The  high-voltage induced in the secondary coil is directed to  the distributor, which consists of two parts: revolving and  stationary. The revolving part is called a distributor rotor and  the stationary part is called a distributor block. The rotating  part, which may take the shape of a disc, drum, or finger,  is made of a non-conducting material with an embedded  conductor. The stationary part consists of a block also made of  non-conducting material that contains terminals and terminal  receptacles into which the ignition lead wiring that connects  the distributor to the spark plug is attached. This high-voltage  is used to jump the air gap of electrodes of the spark plug in  the cylinder to ignite the air-fuel mixture.  

As the magnet moves into the E-gap position for the No.  1 cylinder and the breaker points just separate or open, the  distributor rotor aligns itself with the No. 1 electrode in the  distributor block. The secondary voltage induced as the  breaker points open enters the rotor where it arcs a small air  gap to the No. 1 electrode in the block.  

Since the distributor rotates at one-half crankshaft speed  on all four-stroke cycle engines, the distributor block has  as many electrodes as there are engine cylinders, or as  many electrodes as cylinders served by the magneto. The  electrodes are located c irc um fe rent i ally around the distributor  block so that, as the rotor turns, a circuit is completed to a  different cylinder and spark plug each time there is alignment  between the rotor finger and an electrode in the distributor  block. The electrodes of the distributor block are numbered  consecutively in the direction of distributor rotor travel.  [Figure 4-10]  

The distributor numbers represent the magneto sparking  order rather than the engine cylinder numbers. The distributor  electrode marked “1” is connected to the spark plug in the  No. 1 cylinder; distributor electrode marked  $^{\ast2^{\ast}}$   to the second  

![](images/35476f2bdf0336968029b00d1cf4334f369bd197e8465fa760698f1c523d5c4b.jpg)  
Figure 4-10.   Relation between distributor terminal numbers and  cylinder numbers.  

cylinder to be fired; distributor electrode marked “  $:3"$   to the  third cylinder to be fired, and so forth.  

In  Figure 4-10 , the distributor rotor finger is aligned with  the distributor electrode marked “3,” which fires the No. 5  cylinder of a nine-cylinder radial engine. Since the firing  order of a nine-cylinder radial engine is 1-3-5-7-9-2-4-6-8,  the third electrode in the magneto sparking order serves the  No. 5 cylinder.  

# Magneto & Distributor Venting  

Since magneto and distributor assemblies are subjected to  sudden changes in temperature, the problems of condensation  and moisture are considered in the design of these units.  Moisture in any form is a good conductor of electricity. If  absorbed by the nonconducting material in the magneto, such  as distributor blocks, distributor fingers, and coil cases, it can  create a stray electrical conducting path. The high-voltage  current that normally arcs across the air gaps of the distributor  can flash across a wet insulating surface to ground, or the  high-voltage current can be misdirected to some spark plug  other than the one that should be fired. This condition is called  flashover and usually results in cylinder misfiring. This can  cause a serious engine condition called pre-ignition, which  can damage the engine. For this reason, coils, condensers,  distributors, and distributor rotors are waxed so that moisture  on such units stand in separate beads and do not form a  complete circuit for flashover.  

Flashover can lead to carbon tracking, which appears as a fine  pencil-like line on the unit across which flashover occurs.  The carbon trail results from the electric spark burning dirt  particles that contain hydrocarbon materials. The water in the  hydrocarbon material is evaporated during flashover, leaving  carbon to form a conducting path for current. When moisture  is no longer present, the spark continues to follow the carbon  track to the ground. This prevents the spark from getting to  the spark plug, so the cylinder does not fire.  

Magnetos cannot be hermetically sealed to prevent moisture  from entering a unit, because the magneto is subject to  pressure and temperature changes in altitude. Thus, adequate  drains and proper ventilation reduce the tendency of flashover  and carbon tracking. Good magneto circulation also ensures  that corrosive gases produced by normal arcing across the  distributor air gap, such as ozone, are carried away. In some  installations, pressurization of the internal components of  the magnetos and other various parts of the ignition system  is essential to maintain a higher absolute pressure inside the  magneto and to eliminate flashover due to high altitude flight.  This type of magneto is used with turbocharged engines  that operate at higher altitudes. Flashover becomes more  likely at high altitudes because of the lower air pressure,  which makes it easier for the electricity to jump air gaps.  By pressurizing the interior of the magneto, the normal air  pressure is maintained and the electricity or the spark is  held within the proper areas of the magneto even though the  ambient pressure is very low.  

Even in a pressurized magneto, the air is allowed to flow  through and out of the magneto housing. By providing  more air and allowing small amounts of air to bleed out for  ventilation, the magneto remains pressurized. Regardless of  the method of venting employed, the vent bleeds or valves  must be kept free of obstructions. Further, the air circulating  through the components of the ignition system must be free of  oil since even minute amounts of oil on ignition parts result  in flashover and carbon tracking.  

# Ignition Harness  

The ignition lead directs the electrical energy from the  magneto to the spark plug. The ignition harness contains an  insulated wire for each cylinder that the magneto serves in the  engine.  [Figure 4-11]  One end of each wire is connected to  the magneto distributor block and the other end is connected  to the proper spark plug. The ignition harness leads serve a  dual purpose. It provides the conductor path for the high- tension voltage to the spark plug. It also serves as a shield  for stray magnetic fields that surround the wires as they  momentarily carry high-voltage current. By conducting these  magnetic lines of force to the ground, the ignition harness  cuts down electrical interference with the aircraft radio and  other electrically sensitive equipment.  

A magneto is a high frequency radiation emanating (radio  wave) device during its operation. The wave oscillations  produced in the magneto are uncontrolled and cover a wide  range of frequencies and must be shielded. If the magneto and  ignition leads were not shielded, they would form antennas  and pick up the random frequencies from the ignition system.  

![](images/2aef2657ba8907f642284d063360a4fa0a5cef79076519c177dc134369c3c593.jpg)  
Figure 4-11.   A high-tension ignition harness.  

The lead shielding is a metal mesh braid that surrounds the  entire length of the lead. The lead shielding prevents the  radiation of the energy into the surrounding area.  

Capacitance is the ability to store an electrostatic charge  between two conducting plates separated by a dielectric. Lead  insulation is called a dielectric, meaning it can store electrical  energy as an electrostatic charge. An example of electrostatic  energy storage in a dielectric is the static electricity stored  in a plastic hair comb. When shielding is placed around the  ignition lead, capacitance increases by bringing the two  plates closer together. Electrically, the ignition lead acts as  a capacitor and has the ability to absorb and store electrical  energy. The magneto must produce enough energy to charge  the capacitance caused by the ignition lead and have enough  energy left over to fire the plug.  

Ignition lead capacitance increases the electrical energy  required to provide a spark across the plug gap. More magneto  primary current is needed to fire the plug with the shielded  lead. This capacitance energy is discharged as fire across the  plug gap after each firing of the plug. Reversing the polarity  during servicing by rotating the plugs to new locations, the  plug wear is equalized across the electrodes. The very center  of the ignition lead is the high-voltage carrier surrounded by  a silicone insulator material that is surrounded by a metal  mesh, or shielding, covered with a thin silicone rubber coating  that prevents damage by engine heat, vibration, or weather.  

A sectional view of the typical ignition lead is shown in  Figure 4-12 . Ignition leads must be routed and clamped  correctly to avoid hot spots on the exhaust and vibration  points as the leads are routed from the magneto to the  individual cylinders. Ignition leads are normally of the  all-weather type and are hard connected at the magneto  distributor and affixed to the spark plug by threads. The  shielded ignition lead spark plug terminal is available in all- weather  $\%$   inch diameter and  $\%$    inch diameter barrel ignition  lead nut.  [Figure 4-13]  The  $\%-24$   plug takes  $\mathrm{~a~}\%$   wrench  on the lead nut and the  $\%-20$   plug takes a  $\%$   wrench on the  lead nut. The  $\%$   inch all-weather design utilizes a terminal  seal that results in greater terminal well insulation. This

Figure 4-13.   Ignition lead spark plug end.  

is recommended because the lead end of the spark plug is  completely sealed from moisture.  

An older radial engine type of ignition harness is a manifold  formed to fit around the crankcase of the engine with flexible  extensions terminating at each spark plug. A typical high- tension ignition harness is shown in  Figure 4-14 . Many older  single-row radial engine aircraft ignition systems employ a  dual-magneto system, in which the right magneto supplies  the electric spark for the front plugs in each cylinder, and the  left magneto fires the rear plugs.  

# Ignition Switches  

All units in an aircraft ignition system are controlled by  an ignition switch. The type of switch used varies with the  number of engines on the aircraft and the type of magnetos  used. All switches, however, turn the system off and on in  much the same manner. The ignition switch is different in at  least one respect from all other types of switches: when the  ignition switch is in the off position, a circuit is completed  through the switch to ground. In other electrical switches, the  off position normally breaks or opens the circuit.  

![](images/5ef5c4e951af8df68c7b14923056f718c620e330a14e06bfe7688f0af74d3b88.jpg)

Figure 4-14.   Accessory-mounted nine cylinder engine ignition  harness.  

The ignition switch has one terminal connected to the primary  electrical circuit between the coil and the breaker contact  points. The other terminal of the switch is connected to the  aircraft ground structure. As shown in  Figure 4-15 , two ways  to complete the primary circuit are:  

1.	 Through the closed breaker points to ground and 2.	 Through the closed ignition switch to ground.  

Figure 4-15  shows that the primary current is not interrupted  when the breaker contacts open since there is still a path to  ground through the closed, or off, ignition switch. Since  primary current is not stopped when the contact points open,  there can be no sudden collapse of the primary coil flux field  and no high-voltage induced in the secondary coil to fire the  spark plug.  

As the magnet rotates past the electrical gap (E-gap) position,  a gradual breakdown of the primary flux field occurs. But that  breakdown occurs so slowly that the induced voltage is too  low to fire the spark plug. Thus, when the ignition switch is  in the off position with the switch closed, the contact points  are as completely short-circuited as if they were removed  from the circuit, and the magneto is inoperative.  

When the ignition switch is placed in the on position, switch  open, the interruption of primary current and the rapid  collapse of the primary coil flux field is once again controlled  or triggered by the opening of the breaker contact points.  [Figure 4-16]  When the ignition switch is in the on position,  the switch has absolutely no effect on the primary circuit.  

![](images/6b280512ba119ea751c0f5cba0167f7d564ed01a982790d8fdebdf0699307851.jpg)

Figure 4-16.   Typical ignition switch in on position.  

The ignition/starter switch, or magneto switch, controls the  magnetos on or off and can also connect the starter solenoid  for turning the starter. When a starting vibrator, a box that  emits pulsating direct current (DC), is used on the engine,  the ignition/starter switch is used to control the vibrator  and retard points. This system is explained in detail later in  this chapter. Some ignition starter switches have a push to  prime feature during the starting cycle. This system allows  additional fuel to spray into the intake port of the cylinder  during the starting cycle.  

# Single & Dual High-Tension System Magnetos  

High-tension system magnetos used on aircraft engines are  either single or dual type magnetos. The single magneto  design incorporates the distributor in the housing with  the magneto breaker assembly, rotating magnet, and coil.  [Figure 4-17]  The dual magneto incorporates two magnetos  contained in a single housing. One rotating magnet and a  cam are common to two sets of breaker points and coils.  Two separate distributor units are mounted in the magneto.  [Figure 4-18]  

# Magneto Mounting Systems  

Flange-mounted magnetos are attached to the engine by  a flange around the driven end of the rotating shaft of the  magneto.  [Figure 4-19]  Elongated slots in the mounting  flange permit adjustment through a limited range to aid in  timing the magneto to the engine. Some magnetos mount by  the flange and use clamps on each side to secure the magneto  to the engine. This design also allows for timing adjustments.  Base mounted magnetos are only used on very old or antique  aircraft engines.

# High- & Low-Tension Magneto Systems  

High-tension ignition systems have undergone many  refinements and improvements in design. This includes new  electronic systems that control more than just providing  ignition to the cylinders. High-tension voltage presents  certain problems with carrying the high-voltage from the  magneto internally and externally to the spark plugs. In early  years, it was difficult to provide insulators that could contain  the high-voltage, especially at high altitudes when the air  pressures were reduced. Another requirement of high-tension  systems was that all weather and radio-equipped aircraft have  ignition wires enclosed in shielding to prevent radio noise  due to high-voltages. Many aircraft were turbo supercharged  and operated at increased high altitudes. The low pressure at  these altitudes would allow the high-voltage to leak out even  more. To meet these problems, low-tension ignition systems  were developed.  

Electronically, the low-tension system is different from the  high-tension system. In the low-tension system, low-voltage  is generated in the magneto and flows to the primary winding  of a transformer coil located near the spark plug. There,  the voltage is increased to high by transformer action and  conducted to the spark plug by very short high-tension leads.  [Figure 4-20]  

The low-tension system virtually eliminates flashover in both  the distributor and the harness because the air gaps within the  distributor have been eliminated by the use of a brush-type  distributor, and high-voltage is present only in short leads  between the transformer and spark plug.  

Although a certain amount of electrical leakage is characteristic  of all ignition systems, it is more pronounced on radio- shielded installations because the metal conduit is at ground  potential and close to the ignition wires throughout their  entire length. In low-tension systems, however, this leakage is  reduced considerably because the current throughout most of  the system is transmitted at a low-voltage potential. Although  

![](images/a505273918e8e1a643d00b778efa2d29032b339a31440b1c4e0d7c9389b5214d.jpg)  
Figure 4-20.   Simplified low-tension ignition system schematic.  

the leads between the transformer coils and the spark plugs of  a low-tension ignition system are short, they are high-tension  high-voltage conductor, and are subject to the same failures  that occur in high-tension systems. Low-tension ignition  systems have limited use in modern aircraft because of the  excellent materials and shielding available to construct high- tension ignition leads and the added cost of a coil for each  spark plug with the low-tension system.  

# Types of DC Generators  

There are three types of DC generators: series wound, parallel  (shunt) wound, and series-parallel (compound) wound. The  appropriate generator is determined by the connections to  the armature and field circuits with respect to the external  circuit. The external circuit is the electrical load powered  by the generator. In general, the external circuit is used  for charging the aircraft battery and supplying power to  all electrical equipment being used by the aircraft. As their  names imply, windings in series have characteristics different  from windings in parallel.  

# Series Wound DC Generators  

The series generator contains a field winding connected  in series with the external circuit.  [Figure 4-21]  Series  generators have very poor voltage regulation under changing  load, since the greater the current is through the field coils  to the external circuit, the greater the induced EMFs and the  greater the output voltage is. When the aircraft electrical  load is increased, the voltage increases; when the load is  decreased, the voltage decreases.  

Since the series wound generator has such poor voltage  and current regulation, it is never employed as an airplane  generator. Generators in airplanes have field windings, that  

![](images/f4fbac695052c237e3e3f69c814a9d3268b19e764265b060d6cb6968366c810a.jpg)  
Figure 4-21.   Diagram of a series wound generator.  

are connected either in shunt or in compound formats.  

# Parallel (Shunt) Wound DC Generators  

A generator having a field winding connected in parallel with  the external circuit is called a shunt generator.  [Figure 4-22]  It  should be noted that, in electrical terms, shunt means parallel.  Therefore, this type of generator could be called either a shunt  generator or a parallel generator.  

In a shunt generator, any increase in load causes a decrease  in the output voltage, and any decrease in load causes an  increase output voltage. This occurs since the field winding  is connected in parallel to the load and armature, and all the  current flowing in the external circuit passes only through  the armature winding (not the field).  

As shown in  Figure 4-22A , the output voltage of a shunt  generator can be controlled by means of a rheostat inserted  in series with the field windings. As the resistance of the field  circuit is increased, the field current is reduced; consequently,  the generated voltage is also reduced. As the field resistance  is decreased, the field current increases and the generator  output increases. In the actual aircraft, the field rheostat  would be replaced with an automatic control device, such  

![](images/7be115a45708a0c5d181b8a72b48d086502877b4fd8ba78b57213f83a73be03c.jpg)  
Figure 4-22.  Shunt wound generator.  

attached to the generator. When replacing a generator, it is  important to choose one of the proper ratings.  

# Compound Wound DC Generators  

A compound wound generator employs two field windings one  in series and another in parallel with the load.  [Figure 4-23]  

This arrangement takes advantage of both the series and  parallel characteristics described earlier. The output of a  compound wound generator is relatively constant, even with  changes in the load.  

# Generator Ratings  

A DC generator is typically rated for its voltage and power  output. Each generator is designed to operate at a specified  voltage, approximately 14 or 28 volts. It should be noted that  aircraft electrical systems are designed to operate at one of  these two voltage values. The aircraft’s voltage depends on  which battery is selected for that aircraft. Batteries are either  12 or 24 volts when fully charged. The generator selected  must have a voltage output slightly higher than the battery  voltage. Hence, the 14- or 28-volt rating is required for  aircraft DC generators.  

The power output of any generator is given as the maximum  number of amperes the generator can safely supply. Generator  rating and performance data are stamped on the nameplate  

![](images/65d76c222bb8d2385bde690e2371e46677e434a3a5b219a2e87e695f844a0ec1.jpg)

The rotation of generators is termed either clockwise or  counterclockwise, as viewed from the driven end. The  direction of rotation may also be stamped on the data plate. It  is important that a generator with the correct rotation be used;  otherwise, the polarity of the output voltage is reversed. The  speed of an aircraft engine varies from idle rpm to takeoff  rpm; however, during the major portion of a flight, it is at a  constant cruising speed. The generator drive is usually geared  to turn the generator between   $1\%$   and   $1\%$   times the engine  crankshaft speed. Most aircraft generators have a speed at  which they begin to produce their normal voltage. Called the  “coming in” speed, it is usually about   $1{,}500\,\mathrm{rpm}$  .  

# DC Generator Maintenance  

The following information about the inspection and  maintenance of DC generator systems is general in nature  because of the large number of differing aircraft generator  systems. These procedures are for familiarization only.  Always follow the applicable manufacturer’s instructions  for a given generator system. In general, the inspection of  the generator installed in the aircraft should include the  following items:  

1.	 Security of generator mounting. 2.	 Condition of electrical connections. 3.	 Dirt and oil in the generator. If oil is present, check  engine oil seals. Blow out any dirt with compressed air. 4.	 Condition of generator brushes. 5.	 Generator operation. 6.	 Voltage regulator operation.  

Sparking of brushes quickly reduces the effective brush area  in contact with the commutator bars. The degree of such  sparking should be determined. Excessive wear warrants  a detailed inspection and possible replacement of various  components.  [Figure 4-24]  

Manufacturers usually recommend the following procedures  to seat brushes that do not make good contact with slip  rings or commutators. Lift the brush sufficiently to permit  the insertion of a strip of extra-fine 000 (triple aught) grit,  or finer, sandpaper under the brush, rough side towards the  carbon brush.  [Figure 4-25]  

Pull the sandpaper in the direction of armature rotation, being  careful to keep the ends of the sandpaper as close to the slip  ring or commutator surface as possible in order to avoid  rounding the edges of the brush. When pulling the sandpaper  back to the starting point, raise the brush so it does not ride  

![](images/45c410cf67bb68bac7e2e4cc2f27a7b38baa1fa21b56b3138c758037ec01f8e1.jpg)

on the sandpaper. Sand the brush only in the direction of  rotation. Carbon dust resulting from brush sanding should  be thoroughly cleaned from all parts of the generators after  a sanding operation.  

After the generator has run for a short period, brushes should  be inspected to make sure that pieces of sand have not become  embedded in the brush. Under no circumstances should  emery cloth or similar abrasives be used for seating brushes  (or smoothing commutators), since they contain conductive  materials that cause arcing between brushes and commutator  bars. It is important that the brush spring pressure be correct.  Excessive pressure causes rapid wear of brushes. Too little  pressure, however, allows bouncing of the brushes, resulting  in burned and pitted surfaces. The pressure recommended by  the manufacturer should be checked by the use of a spring  scale graduated in ounces. Brush spring tension on some  generators can be adjusted. A spring scale is used to measure  the pressure that a brush exerts on the commutator.  

Flexible low-resistance pigtails are provided on most heavy  current carrying brushes, and their connections should be  securely made and checked at frequent intervals. The pigtails  should never be permitted to alter or restrict the free motion of  the brush. The purpose of the pigtail is to conduct the current  from the armature, through the brushes, to the external circuit  of the generator.  

# FADEC System Description  

A FADEC is a solid-state digital electronic ignition and  electronic sequential port fuel injection system with only  one moving part that consists of the opening and closing  of the fuel injector. FADEC continuously monitors and  controls ignition, timing, and fuel mixture/delivery/injection,  and spark ignition as an integrated control system. FADEC  monitors engine operating conditions (crankshaft speed, top  dead center position, the induction manifold pressure, and  the induction air temperature) and then automatically adjusts  the fuel-to-air ratio mixture and ignition timing accordingly  for any given power setting to attain optimum engine  performance. As a result, engines equipped with FADEC  require neither magnetos nor manual mixture control.  

This microprocessor-based system controls ignition timing  for engine starting and varies timing with respect to engine  speed and manifold pressure.  [Figure 4-26]  

PowerLink provides control in both specified operating  conditions and fault conditions. The system is designed to  prevent adverse changes in power or thrust. In the event of  loss of primary aircraft-supplied power, the engine controls  continue to operate using a secondary power source (SPS).  As a control device, the system performs self-diagnostics to  determine overall system status and conveys this information  to the pilot by various indicators on the health status  annunciator (HSA) panel. PowerLink is able to withstand  storage temperature extremes and operate at the same  capacity as a non-FADEC-equipped engine in extreme heat,  cold, and high humidity environments.  

# Low-Voltage Harness  

The low-voltage harness connects all essential components  of the FADEC System.  [Figure 4-26]  This harness acts as  a signal transfer bus interconnecting the electronic control  

![](images/e54966bc9e61567fca6266a076a5aec1e05fa5780444ea8a4a85709f476c1325.jpg)  
Figure 4-26.   PowerLink system components.  

units (ECUs) with aircraft power sources, the ignition switch,  speed sensor assembly (SSA), temperature and pressure  sensors. The fuel injector coils and all sensors, except the  SSA and fuel pressure and manifold pressure sensors, are  hardwired to the low-voltage harness. This harness transmits  sensor inputs to the ECUs through a 50-pin connector. The  harness connects to the engine-mounted pressure sensors  via cannon plug connectors. The 25-jpin connectors connect  the harness to the speed sensor signal conditioning unit.  The low-voltage harness attaches to the cabin harness by a  firewall-mounted data port through the same cabin harness/ bulkhead connector assembly. The bulkhead connectors also  supply the aircraft electrical power required to run the system.  

The ECU is at the heart of the system, providing both ignition  and fuel injection control to operate the engine with the  maximum efficiency realizable. Each ECU contains two  microprocessors, referred to as a computer, that control two  cylinders. Each computer controls its own assigned cylinder  and is capable of providing redundant control for the other  computer’s cylinder.  

The computer constantly monitors the engine speed and  timing pulses developed from the camshaft gear as they are  detected by the SSA. Knowing the exact engine speed and  the timing sequence of the engine, the computers monitor  the manifold air pressure and manifold air temperature to  calculate air density and determine the mass air flow into the  cylinder during the intake stroke. The computers calculate  the percentage of engine power based on engine revolutions  per minute (rpm) and manifold air pressure.  

From this information, the computer can then determine the  fuel required for the combustion cycle for either best power  or best economy mode of operation. The computer precisely  times the injection event, and the duration of the injector  should be on time for the correct fuel-to-air ratio. Then, the  computer sets the spark ignition event and ignition timing,  again based on percentage of power calculation. Exhaust  gas temperature is measured after the burn to verify that the  fuel-to-air ratio calculations were correct for that combustion  event. This process is repeated by each computer for its own  assigned cylinder on every combustion/power cycle.  

The computers can also vary the amount of fuel to control  the fuel-to-air ratio for each individual cylinder to control  both cylinder head temperature (CHT) and exhaust gas  temperature (EGT).  

# Electronic Control Unit (ECU)  

An ECU is assigned to a pair of engine cylinders.  [Figure 4-27] The ECUs control the fuel mixture and spark timing for  their respective engine cylinders; ECU 1 controls opposing  cylinders 1 and 2, ECU 2 controls cylinders 3 and 4, and ECU  

![](images/72dd99649ff58f7526e7f22af3df7e107937fdc8426595deefa156cfe4754201.jpg)  
Figure 4-27.   Electronic control unit.  

3 controls cylinders 5 and 6. Each ECU is divided into upper  and lower portions. The lower portion contains an electronic  circuit board, while the upper portion houses the ignition  coils. Each electronic control board contains two independent  microprocessor controllers that serve as control channels.  During engine operation, one control channel is assigned to  operate a single engine cylinder. Therefore, one ECU can  control two engine cylinders, one control channel per cylinder.  The control channels are independent, and there are no shared  electronic components within one ECU. They also operate  on independent and separate power supplies. However, if  one control channel fails, the other control channel in the  pair within the same ECU is capable of operating both its  assigned cylinder and the other opposing engine cylinder as  backup control for fuel injection and ignition timing. Each  control channel on the ECU monitors the current operating  conditions and operates its cylinder to attain engine operation  within specified parameters. The following transmit inputs to  the control channels across the low-voltage harness:  

1.	 Speed sensor that monitors engine speed and crank  position, 2.	 Fuel pressure sensors, 3.	 Manifold pressure sensors, 4.	 Manifold air temperature (MAT) sensors, 5.	 CHT sensors, and 6.	 EGT sensors.  

All critical sensors are dually redundant with one sensor  from each type of pair connected to control channels in  different ECUs. Synthetic software default values are also  used in the unlikely event that both sensors of a redundant  pair fail. The control channel continuously monitors changes  in engine speed, manifold pressure, manifold temperature,  and fuel pressure based on sensor input relative to operating  conditions to determine how much fuel to inject into the  intake port of the cylinder.  

# PowerLink Ignition System  

The ignition system consists of the high-voltage coils atop the  ECU, the high-voltage harness, and spark plugs. Since there  are two spark plugs per cylinder on all engines, a six-cylinder  engine has 12 leads and 12 spark plugs. One end of each lead  on the high-voltage harness attaches to a spark plug, and the  other end of the lead wire attaches to the spark plug towers on  each ECU. The spark tower pair is connected to opposite ends  of one of the ECU’s coil packs. Two coil packs are located  in the upper portion of the ECU. Each coil pack generates  a high-voltage pulse for two spark plug towers. One tower  fires a positive polarity pulse and the other of the same coil  fires a negative polarity pulse. Each ECU controls the ignition  spark for two engine cylinders. The control channel within  each ECU commands one of the two coil packs to control  the ignition spark for the engine cylinders.  [Figure 4-28] The high-voltage harness carries energy from the ECU spark  towers to the spark plugs on the engine.  

For both spark plugs in a given cylinder to fire on the  compression stroke, both control channels must fire their  coil packs. Each coil pack has a spark plug from each of the  two cylinders controlled by that ECU unit.  

The ignition spark is timed to the engine’s crankshaft position.  The timing is variable throughout the engine’s operating  range and is dependent upon the engine load conditions. The  spark energy is also varied with respect to the engine load.  

Note:  Engine ignition timing is established by the ECUs and  cannot be manually adjusted.  

# Engine Indicating & Crew Alerting System  (EICAS)  

An engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS)  performs many of the same functions as an ECAM system.  The objective is still to monitor the aircraft systems for  the pilot. All EICAS display engine, as well as airframe,  parameters. Traditional gauges are not utilized, other than  a standby combination engine gauge in case of total system  failure.  

EICAS is also a two-monitor, two-computer system with a  display select panel. Both monitors receive information from  the same computer. The second computer serves as a standby.  Digital and analog inputs from the engine and airframe  systems are continuously monitored. Caution and warning  lights, as well as aural tones, are incorporated.  [Figure 4-29]  

EICAS provides full time primary engine parameters (EPR,  N1, EGT) on the top, primary monitor. Advisories and  warnings are also shown there. Secondary engine parameters  

![](images/e16c7ca14b7b7955a4f6cf83c671941fd6beb1bc55d130332bb9c868d76340ce.jpg)  
Figure 4-28.   Ignition control.  

and nonengine system status are displayed on the bottom  screen. The lower screen is also used for maintenance  diagnosis when the aircraft is on the ground. Color coding  is used, as well as message prioritizing.  

The display select panel allows the pilot to choose which  computer is actively supplying information. It also controls  the display of secondary engine information and system status  displays on the lower monitor. EICAS has a unique feature  that automatically records the parameters of a failure event  to be regarded afterwards by maintenance personnel. Pilots  that suspect a problem may be occurring during flight can  press the event record button on the display select panel. This  also records the parameters for that flight period to be studied  later by maintenance. Hydraulic, electrical, environmental,  performance, and APU data are examples of what may be  recorded.  

EICAS uses BITE for systems and components. A  maintenance panel is included for technicians. From this  panel, when the aircraft is on the ground, push-button  switches display information pertinent to various systems  for analysis.  [Figure 4-30]  

# Auxiliary Ignition Units  

During engine starting, the output of a magneto is low  because the cranking speed of the engine is low. This is  understandable when the factors that determine the amount  of voltage induced in a circuit are considered.  

To increase the value of an induced voltage, the strength  of the magnetic field must be increased by using a stronger  magnet, by increasing the number of turns in the coil, or by  increasing the rate of relative motion between the magnet  and the conductor.  

Since the strength of the rotating magnet and the number  of turns in the coil are constant factors in magneto ignition  systems, the voltage produced depends upon the speed at  which the rotating magnet is turned. When the engine is  being cranked for starting, the magnet is rotated at about   $80\;\mathrm{rpm}$  . Since the value of the induced voltage is so low, a  spark may not jump the spark plug gap. To facilitate engine  starting, an auxiliary device is connected to the magneto to  provide a high ignition voltage.  

Ordinarily, such auxiliary ignition units are energized by the  battery and connected to the left magneto. Reciprocating  engine starting systems normally include one of the following  types of auxiliary starting systems: booster coil (older style),  starting vibrator (sometimes called shower of sparks),  impulse coupling, or electronic ignition systems.  

During the starting cycle, the engine is turning very slowly  compared to normal speed. The ignition must be retarded  or moved back to prevent kickback of the piston trying to

rotate opposite normal rotation. Each starting system has a  method of retarding the spark during starting of the engine.  

# Booster Coil  

Used mainly with older radial engine ignition systems,  the booster coil assembly consists of two coils wound on  a soft iron core, a set of contact points, and a condenser.  [Figure 4-31]  The booster coil is separate from the magneto  and can generate a series of sparks on its own. During the  start cycle, these sparks are routed to the trailing finger on  the distributor rotor and then to the appropriate cylinder  ignition lead. The primary winding has one end grounded at  the internal grounding strip and its other end connected to the  moving contact point. The stationary contact is fitted with a  terminal to which battery voltage is applied when the magneto  switch is placed in the start position, or automatically applied  when the starter is engaged. The secondary winding, which  contains several times as many turns as the primary coil,  has one end grounded at the internal grounding strip and the  other terminated at a high-tension terminal. The high-tension  terminal is connected to an electrode in the distributor by an  ignition cable.  

Since the regular distributor terminal is grounded through  the primary or secondary coil of a high-tension magneto,  the high-voltage furnished by the booster coil must be  distributed by a separate circuit in the distributor rotor. This is  accomplished by using two electrodes in one distributor rotor.  The main electrode, or finger, carries the magneto output  voltage; the auxiliary electrode or trailing finger, distributes  only the output of the booster coil. The auxiliary electrode  is always located so that it trails the main electrode, thus  retarding the spark during the starting period.  

![](images/a398dcf8d5a9ec7e367c7ed47ec5fe3b571421b77b7660808d7bc916631b3f0c.jpg)  
Figure 4-30.  The EICAS maintenance control panel is for the exclusive use of technicians.  

Figure 4-32  illustrates, in schematic form, the booster coil  components shown in  Figure   $_{4-3I}$  . In operation, battery  voltage is applied to the positive   $(+)$   terminal of the booster  coil through the start switch. This causes current to flow  through the closed contact points to the primary coil and  ground.  [Figure 4-32]  Current flow through the primary coil  sets up a magnetic field about the coil that magnetizes the  coil core. As the core is magnetized, it attracts the movable  contact point, which is normally held against the stationary  contact point by a spring.  

As the movable contact point is pulled toward the iron  core, the primary circuit is broken, collapsing the magnetic  field that extended about the coil core. Since the coil core  acts as an electromagnet only when current flows in the  primary coil, it loses its magnetism as soon as the primary  coil circuit is broken. This permits the action of the spring  to close the contact points and again complete the primary  coil circuit. This remagnetizes the coil core, and again  attracts the movable contact point, which again opens the  primary coil circuit. This action causes the movable contact  point to vibrate rapidly, as long as the start switch is held  in the closed, or on, position. The result of this action is a  continuously expanding and collapsing magnetic field that  links the secondary coil of the booster coil. With several  times as many turns in the secondary as in the primary, the  induced voltage that results from lines of force linking the  secondary is high enough to furnish ignition for the engine.  

The condenser, which is connected across the contact points,  has an important function in this circuit.  [Figure 4-32]  As  current flow in the primary coil is interrupted by the opening  of the contact points, the high self-induced voltage that  accompanies each collapse of the primary magnetic field  surges into the condenser. Without a condenser, an arc would  jump across the points with each collapse of the magnetic  field. This would burn and pit the contact points and greatly  reduce the voltage output of the booster coil. The booster  coil generates a pulsating DC in the primary winding that  induces a high-voltage spark in the secondary windings of  the booster coil.  

# Impulse Coupling  

Many opposed reciprocating engines are equipped with  an impulse coupling as the auxiliary starting system. An  impulse coupling gives one of the magnetos attached to the  

![](images/b1ddfa5d52c908efb4101c7cd7b0cff631619e37d9b3dc4767d26840787b9d3f.jpg)

Figure 4-32.   Booster coil schematic.  

engine, generally the left, a brief acceleration, that produces  an intense spark for starting. This device consists of a cam  and flyweight assembly, spring, and a body assembly.  [Figure 4-33]  The assembled impulse coupling is shown  installed on a typical magneto in  Figure 4-34 .  

The magneto is flexibly connected through the impulse  coupling by means of the spring so that at low speed the  magneto is temporarily held.  [Figure 4-35]  The flyweight,  because of slow rotation, catches on a stud or stop pins,  and the magneto spring is wound as the engine continues to  turn. The engine continues to rotate until the piston of the  cylinder to be fired reaches approximately a top dead center  position. At this point, the magneto flyweight contacts the  body of the impulse coupling and is released. The spring  kicks back to its original position, resulting in a quick twist  of the rotating magnet of the magneto.  [Figure 4-36]  This,  being equivalent to high-speed magneto rotation, produces  a spark that jumps the gap at the spark plug electrodes. The  impulse coupling has two functions: rotating the magneto fast  enough to produce a good spark and retarding the timing of  the spark during the start cycle. After the engine is started and  the magneto reaches a speed at which it furnishes sufficient  current, the flyweights in the impulse coupling fly outward  due to centrifugal force or rapid rotation. This action prevents  the two flyweight coupling members from contact with the  stop pin. That makes it a solid unit, returning the magneto to  a normal timing position relative to the engine. The presence  of an impulse coupling is identified by a sharp clicking noise  as the crankshaft is turned at starter cranking speed past top  center on each cylinder.  

A problem that can arise from impulse couplings is that  the flyweights can become magnetized and not engage the  stop pins. Congealed oil or sludge on the flyweights during  cold weather may produce the same results. This prevents  the flyweight weights from engaging the stop pins, which  results in no starting spark being produced. Wear can cause  problems with impulse couplings. They should be inspected  and any maintenance should be performed as set forth by the  manufacturer. Another disadvantage of the impulse coupling  is that it can produce only one spark for each firing cycle  of the cylinder. This is a disadvantage, especially during  

![](images/23f27f9e7fc833b779d4c18b3eaf8152ed0c6ed267a55ac9ea17c0e9ea371a42.jpg)  
Figure 4-33.   Parts of an impulse coupling.  

adverse starting conditions. Even with these disadvantages,  the impulse coupling is still in wide use.  

# High-Tension Retard Breaker Vibrator  

To provide for more spark power during the starting cycle,  the shower of sparks system was developed, which provides  several sparks at the spark plug electrodes during starting.  The starting vibrator, or shower of sparks, consists essentially  of an electrically operated vibrator, a condenser, and a relay.  [Figure 4-37]  These units are mounted on a base plate and  

![](images/054ec02d627379af7ea58a6626d3261cea4b6de0b66a37d0011026c8078e0f1a.jpg)

enclosed in a metal case.  

The starting vibrator, unlike the booster coil, does not  produce the high ignition voltage within itself. The function  of this starting vibrator is to change the DC of the battery  into a pulsating DC and deliver it to the primary coil of the  magneto. Closing the ignition switch energizes the starter  solenoid and causes the engine to rotate. At the same time,  current also flows through the vibrator coil and its contact  points. Current flow in the vibrator coil sets up a magnetic  field that attracts and opens the vibrator points. When the  vibrator points open, current flow in the coil stops, and the  magnetic field that attracted the movable vibrator contact  point disappears. This allows the vibrator points to close and  

![](images/0851e06d5679857a370bd138a09a5f0b5b95b4d1877077fe1717258600143819.jpg)  
Figure 4-36.   Flyweight contacts body, releasing impulse coupling  to spin.  

again permits battery current to flow in the vibrator coil. This  completes a cycle of operation. The cycle, however, occurs  many times per second, so rapidly that the vibrator points  produce an audible buzz.  

Each time the vibrator points close, current flows to the  magneto as a pulsating DC. Since this current is being  interrupted many times per second, the resulting magnetic  field is building and collapsing across the primary and  secondary coils of the magneto many times per second.  The rapid successions of separate voltages induced in the  secondary coil produces a shower of sparks across the  selected spark plug air gap.  

The retard breaker magneto and starting vibrator system is  used as part of the high-tension starting system on many  types of aircraft. Designed for four- and six-cylinder ignition  systems, the retard breaker magneto eliminates the need for  the impulse coupling in light aircraft. This system uses an  additional breaker to obtain retarded sparks for starting. The  starting vibrator is also adaptable to many helicopter ignition  systems. A schematic diagram of an ignition system using  the retard breaker magneto and starting vibrator concept is  shown in  Figure 4-37 .  

With the magneto switch in the both position and the starter  switch S1 in the on position, starter solenoid L3 and coil L1  are energized, closing relay contacts R4, R1, R2, and R3. R3  connects the right magneto to ground, keeping it inoperative  during starting operation. Electrical current flows from the  battery through R1, vibrator points V1, coil L2, through both  the retard breaker points, through R2, and the main breaker  points of the left magneto to ground.  

The energized coil L2 opens vibrator points V1, interrupting  the current flow through L2. The magnetic field about L2  collapses, and vibrator points V1 close again. Once more,  

![](images/c58229e0865278f04d9fd4a0299550abfb73a02bd941078f4fdf428052ff9e87.jpg)  
Figure 4-37.   High-tension retard breaker magneto and starting vibrator circuit.  

current flows through L2, and again V1 vibrator points open.  This process is repeated continuously, and the interrupted  battery current flows to ground through the main and retard  breaker points of the left magneto.  

Since relay R4 is closed, the starter is energized and the engine  crankshaft is rotated. When the engine reaches its normal  advance firing position, the main breaker points of the left  magneto begin to open. The interrupted surges of current from  the vibrator can still find a path to ground through the retard  breaker points, which do not open until the retarded firing  position of the engine is reached. At this point in crankshaft  travel, the retard points open. Since the main breaker points  are still open, the magneto primary coil is no longer shorted,  and current produces a magnetic field around T1.  

Each time the vibrator points V1 open, current flow through  V1 is interrupted. The collapsing field about T1 cuts through  the magneto coil secondary and induces a high-voltage surge  of energy used to fire the spark plug. Since the V1 points are  opening and closing rapidly and continuously, a shower of  sparks is furnished to the cylinders when both the main and  retard breaker points are open.  

After the engine begins to accelerate, the manual starter switch  is released, causing L1 and L3 to become deenergized. This  action causes both the vibrator and retard breaker circuits to  become inoperative. It also opens relay contact R3, which  removes the ground from the right magneto. Both magnetos  now fire at the normal running advanced degree position of  crankshaft rotation before top dead center piston position.  

# Low-Tension Retard Breaker Vibrator  

This system, which is in limited use, is designed for light  aircraft reciprocating engines. A typical system consists of a  retard breaker magneto, a single breaker magneto, a starting  vibrator, transformer coils, and a starter and ignition switch.  [Figure 4-38]  

To operate the system, place the starter switch S3 in the  on position. This energizes starter solenoid L3 and coil  L1, closing relay contacts R1, R2, R3, and R4. With the  magneto switch in the L position, current flows through R1,  the vibrator points, L2, R2, and through the main breaker  points to ground. Current also flows through R3 and the  retard breaker points to ground. Current through L2 builds  up a magnetic field that opens the vibrator points. Then, the  current stops flowing through L2, reclosing the points. These  surges of current flow through both the retard and main  breaker points to ground.  

Since the starter switch is closed, the engine crankshaft is  turning. When it has turned to the normal advance or running  ignition position, the main breaker points of the magneto  

![](images/f3c36b8593f9bcd3e9b8c5d0dbfe0b4314a85cabdd8fd9546f5e84df55e4721e.jpg)  
Figure 4-38.  Low-tension retard breaker magneto and starting vibrator circuit.  

open. However, current still flows to ground through the  closed retard breaker points. As the engine continues to turn,  the retard ignition position is reached, and the retard breaker  points open. Since the main breaker points are still open,  current must flow to ground through coil L4, producing a  magnetic field around the coil L4.  

As the engine continues to turn, the vibrator breaker points  open, collapsing the L4 magnetic field through T1 primary,  inducing a high-voltage in the secondary of T1 to fire the  spark plug.  

When the engine fires, the starter switch is released, de- energizing L1 and L3. This opens the vibrator circuit and  retard breaker points circuit. The ignition switch is then  turned to the both position, permitting the right magneto to  operate in time with the left magneto.  

# Spark Plugs  

The function of the spark plug in an ignition system is to  conduct a short impulse of high-voltage current through  the wall of the combustion chamber. Inside the combustion  chamber, it provides an air gap across which the impulse  can produce an electric spark to ignite the air-fuel charge.  While the aircraft spark plug is simple in construction and  operation, it can be the cause of malfunctions in aircraft  engines. Despite this fact, spark plugs provide a great deal of  trouble-free operation when properly maintained and when  correct engine operating procedures are practiced.  

Spark plugs operate at extreme temperatures, electrical  pressures, and very high cylinder pressures. A cylinder of an  engine operating at   $2{,}100\,\mathrm{rpm}$   must produce approximately  17 separate and distinct high-voltage sparks that bridge the  air gap of a single spark plug each second. This would appear  as a continuous spark across the spark plug electrodes at  temperatures of over   $3{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$   At the same time, the spark  plug is subjected to gas pressures as high as 2,000 pounds  per square inch (psi) and electrical pressure as high as 20,000  volts. Given the extremes that spark plugs must operate under,  and the fact that the engine loses power if one spark does  not occur correctly, proper function of a spark plug in the  operation of the engine is imperative.  

The three main components of a spark plug are the electrode,  insulator, and outer shell.  [Figure 4-39]  The outer shell,  threaded to fit into the cylinder, is usually made of finely  machined steel and is often plated to prevent corrosion from  engine gases and possible thread seizure. Close-tolerance  screw threads and a copper gasket prevent cylinder gas  pressure from escaping around the plug. Pressure that might  escape through the plug is retained by inner seals between the  outer metal shell and the insulator, and between the insulator

and the center electrode assembly. The other end is threaded  to receive the ignition lead from the magneto. All-weather  plugs form a seal between the lead and the plug that is water  proof to prevent moisture from entering this connection.  

The insulator provides a protective core around the electrode.  In addition to affording electrical insulation, the ceramic  insulator core also transfers heat from the ceramic tip, or nose,  to the cylinder. The insulator is made from aluminum oxide  ceramic having excellent dielectric strength, high mechanical  strength, and thermal conductivity. The types of spark plugs  used in different engines vary in respect to heat range, reach,  massive electrode, fine wire electrode (Iridium/platinum),  or other characteristics of the installation requirements for  different engines.  

The electrodes can be of several designs from massive  electrodes or Nickel-base alloy to fine wire electrodes.  [Figure 4-39  and  4-40]  The massive electrode material has  a lower melting point and is more susceptible to corrosion.  The main differences include cost and length of service.  Fine wire iridium and platinum electrodes have a very high  melting point and are considered precious metals. Therefore,  the cost of this type of spark plug is higher, but they have  

![](images/b337f0f4bcc791bf1d3b96bf44ff6f085d51c5b18ec786f11471c2c771f3c0d8.jpg)  
Figure 4-40.   Fine wire electrodes.  

a longer service life with increased performance. Fine wire  spark plugs are more effective than massive electrode plugs  because the size shields its own spark from some of the fuel  air mixture. Less than efficient combustion occurs due to  uneven ignition. The iridium electrode allows for a larger  spark gap, which creates a more intense spark that increases  performance. The spark gap of any electrode is vulnerable  to erosion and the melting point of the electrode material.  

The heat range of a spark plug is a measure of its ability to  transfer the heat of combustion to the cylinder head. The  plug must operate hot enough to burn off carbon deposits,  which can cause fouling, a condition where the plug no  longer produces a spark across the electrodes, yet remain  cool enough to prevent a pre-ignition condition. Spark plug  pre-ignition is caused by plug electrodes glowing red hot as  a glow plug, setting off the air-fuel mixture before the normal  firing position. The length of the nose core is the principal  factor in establishing the plug’s heat range.  [Figure 4-41]   Hot plugs have a long insulator nose that creates a long heat  transfer path; cold plugs have a relatively short insulator  to provide a rapid transfer of heat to the cylinder head.  [Figure 4-41]  

If an engine were operated at only one speed, spark plug  design would be greatly simplified. Because flight demands  impose different loads on the engine, spark plugs must be  designed to operate as hot as possible at slow speeds and light  loads, and as cool as possible at cruise and takeoff power.  

The choice of spark plugs to be used in a specific aircraft  engine is determined by the engine manufacturer after  extensive tests. When an engine is certificated to use hot  

![](images/0d0ef393896db0e1e672c107bd18ba5540286e23754dd4c90fe91672add02841.jpg)  
Figure 4-41.   Hot and cold spark plugs.  

or cold spark plugs, the plug used is determined by the  compression ratio, the degree of supercharging, and how the  engine is to be operated. High-compression engines tend to  use colder range plugs while low-compression engines tend  to use hot range plugs.  

A spark plug with the proper reach ensures that the electrode  end inside the cylinder is in the best position to achieve  ignition. The spark plug reach is the length of the threaded  portion that is inserted in the spark plug bushing of the  cylinder.  [Figure 4-42]  Spark plug seizure and/or improper  combustion within the cylinder can occur if a plug with the  wrong reach is used. In extreme cases, if the reach is too  long, the plug may contact a piston or valve and damage  the engine. If the plug threads are too long, they extend into  the combustion chamber and carbon adheres to the threads  making it almost impossible to remove the plug. This can  also be a source of pre-ignition. Heat of combustion can make  some of the carbon a source for ignition, which can ignite the  air-fuel mixture prematurely. It is very important to select  the approved spark plugs for the engine.

# Reciprocating Engine Ignition System  Maintenance & Inspection  

An aircraft’s ignition system is the result of careful design and  thorough testing. The ignition system usually provides good,  dependable service, provided it is maintained and inspected  properly. However, difficulties can occur with normal wear,  which affects ignition system performance, especially  with magneto systems. Breakdown and deterioration of  insulating materials, breaker point wear, corrosion, bearing  and oil seal wear, and electrical connection problems are all  possible defects that can be associated with magneto-ignition  systems. The ignition timing requires precise adjustment and  painstaking care so that the following four conditions occur  at the same instant:  

1.	 The piston in the No. 1 cylinder must be in a position  a prescribed number of degrees before top dead center  on the compression stroke. 2.	 The rotating magnet of the magneto must be in the  E-gap position. 3.	 The breaker points must be just opening on the No. 1  cam lobe. 4.	 The distributor finger must be aligned with the  electrode serving the No. 1 cylinder.  

If one of these conditions is out of synchronization with any  of the others, the ignition system is out of time. If the spark  is out of time, it is not delivered to the cylinder at the correct  time and engine performance decreases.  

When ignition in the cylinder occurs before the optimum  crankshaft position is reached, the timing is said to be early.  If ignition occurs too early, the piston rising in the cylinder  is opposed by the full force of combustion. This condition  results in a loss of engine power, overheating, and possible  detonation and pre-ignition.  

If ignition occurs at a time after the optimum crankshaft  position is reached, the ignition timing is said to be late. If it  occurs too late, not enough time is allowed to consume the  air-fuel charge, and combustion is incomplete. As a result,  the engine loses power and requires a greater throttle opening  to carry a given propeller load.  

Moisture forming on different parts of the ignition system  causes more common irregularities. Moisture can enter  ignition system units through cracks or loose covers, or it  can result from condensation. Breathing, a situation that  occurs during the readjustment of the system from low to  high atmospheric pressure, can result in drawing in moisture- laden air. Ordinarily, the heat of the engine is sufficient  to evaporate this moisture, but occasionally the moist air  condenses as the engine cools. The result is an appreciable  moisture accumulation which causes the insulation materials  to lose electrical resistance. A slight amount of moisture  contamination may cause reduction in magneto output by  short-circuiting to ground a part of the high-voltage current  intended for the spark plug. If the moisture accumulation is  appreciable, the entire magneto output may be dissipated to  ground by way of flashover and carbon tracking. Moisture  accumulation during flight is extremely rare because the high  operating temperature of the system is effective in preventing  condensation. Difficulties from moisture accumulation are  probably more evident during starting and ground operation.  

Spark plugs are often diagnosed as being faulty when the real  malfunction exists in a different system. Malfunctioning of  the carburetor, poor fuel distribution, too much valve overlap,  leaking primer system, or poor idle speed and mixture settings  show symptoms that are the same as those for faulty ignition.  Unfortunately, many of these conditions can be temporarily  improved by a spark plug change, but the trouble recurs in a  short time because the real cause of the malfunction has not  been eliminated. A thorough understanding of the various  engine systems, along with meticulous inspection and good  maintenance methods, can substantially reduce such errors.  

# Magneto-Ignition Timing Devices  

# Built-In Engine Timing Reference Marks  

Most reciprocating engines have timing reference marks  built into the engine. The timing reference marks vary by  manufacturer.  [Figure 4-43]  When the starter gear hub is  installed correctly, the timing marks are marked on it that  line up with the mark on the starter. On an engine that has no  starter gear hub, the timing mark is normally on the propeller  flange edge.  [Figure 4-44]  The top center (TC) mark stamped  on the edge aligns with the crankcase split line below the  crankshaft when the No. 1 piston is at top dead center. Other  flange marks indicate degrees before top center.  

Some engines have degree markings on the propeller  reduction drive gear. To time these engines, the plug  provided on the exterior of the reduction gear housing must  be removed to view the timing marks. On other engines, the  timing marks are on a crankshaft flange and can be viewed  by removing a plug from the crankcase. In every case, the  engine manufacturer’s instructions give the location of built- in timing reference marks.  

In using built-in timing marks to position the crankshaft, be  sure to sight straight across the stationary pointer or mark on  the nose section, the propeller shaft, crankshaft flange, or bell  gear.  [Figure 4-45]  Sighting at an angle results in an error  in positioning the crankshaft. Normally, the No. 1 cylinder  is used to time or check the timing of the magnetos. When  installing magnetos, the timing marks must be lined up and  the No. 1 cylinder must be on the compression stroke.  

![](images/a0d945c92fa33c2de9fb585f32a52d8cd594504a1728d683e095959611d6a45a.jpg)

Figure 4-44.   Propeller flange timing marks.  

The amount of gear backlash in any system of gears varies  between installations because there is clearance between  the gear teeth. Always take timing when reading, or stop  movement of the engine for timing set up, in the direction  of rotation. Another unfavorable aspect in the use of timing  marks on the reduction gear is the small error that exists when  sighting down the reference mark to the timing mark inside  the housing on the reduction gear. This can occur because  there is depth between the two reference marks.

Figure 4-45.   Typical built-in timing mark on propeller reduction  gear.  

# Timing Discs  

Most timing disc devices are mounted to the crankshaft  flange and use a timing plate.  [Figure 4-46]  The markings  vary according to the specifications of the engine. This plate  is temporarily installed on the crankshaft flange with a scale  numbered in crankshaft degrees and the pointer attached to  the timing disc.  

# Piston Position Indicators  

Any given piston position, whether it is to be used for  ignition, valve, or injection pump timing, is referenced to a  piston position called top dead center. This piston position is  not to be confused with a  piston position called top center. A  piston in top center has little value from a timing standpoint  because the corresponding crankshaft position may vary  from   $1^{\circ}$   to   $5^{\circ}$   for this piston position. This is illustrated in  Figure 4-47,  which is exaggerated to emphasize the no-travel  zone of the piston. Notice that the piston does not move  while the crankshaft describes the small arc from position A  to position B. This no-travel zone occurs between the time  the crankshaft and connecting rod stop pushing the piston  upward, and continues until the crankshaft has swung the  lower end of the connecting rod into a position where the  crankshaft can start pulling the piston downward. Top dead  center is a piston and crankshaft position from which all other  piston and crankshaft locations are referenced. When a piston  is in the top dead center position of the crankshaft, it is also  in the center of the no-travel zone. The piston is in a position  where a straight line can be drawn through the center of the  crankshaft journal, the crankpin, and the piston pin. This is  

![](images/dcfc176eb933c9c3ac9abb3b3c9d0ae76730a9d31d85856067c87febd7e0b243.jpg)

shown on the right of  Figure 4-47 . With such an alignment,  a force applied to the piston could not move the crankshaft.  

# Timing Lights  

Timing lights are used to help determine the exact instant  that the magneto points open. There are two general types  of timing lights in common use. Both have two lights and  three external wire connections. Although both have internal  circuits that are somewhat different, their function is very  much the same.  [Figures 4-48  and  4-49]  

Three wires plug into the light box.  [Figure 4-49]  There are  two lights on the front face of the unit, one green and one  red, and a switch to turn the unit on and off. To use the timing  light, the center lead, which is black, marked “ground lead”  is connected to the case of the magneto being tested. The  other leads are connected to the primary leads of the breaker  point assembly of the magnetos being timed. The color of the  lead corresponds to the color of the light on the timing light.  

With the leads connected in this manner, it can be easily  determined whether the points are open or closed by turning  on the switch and observing the two lights. If the points are  closed, most of the current flows through the breaker points  and not through the transformers, and the lights do not come  on. If the points are open, the current flows through the  transformer and the lights glow. Some models of timing lights  operate in the reverse manner (i.e., the light goes out when  the points open). Each of the two lights is operated separately  by the set of breaker points to which it is connected. This  makes it possible to observe the time, or point in reference to  magneto rotor rotation, that each set of points opens.  

Most timing lights use batteries that must be replaced after  long use. Attempts to use a timing light with weak batteries  may result in erroneous readings because of low current flow  in the circuits.

# Checking the Internal Timing of a Magneto  

When replacing or preparing a magneto for installation,  the first concern is with the internal timing of the magneto.  For each magneto model, the manufacturer determines how  many degrees beyond the neutral position a pole of the rotor  magnet should be to obtain the strongest spark at the instant  of breaker point separation. This angular displacement from  the neutral position, known as the E-gap angle, varies with  different magneto models. On one model, a step is cut on  the end of the breaker cam to check internal timing of the  magneto. When a straightedge is laid along this step and it  coincides with the timing marks on the rim of the breaker  housing, the magneto rotor is then in the E-gap position, and  the breaker contact points should just begin to open.  

Another method for checking E-gap is to align a timing  mark with a pointed chamfered tooth.  [Figure 4-50]  The  breaker points should be just starting to open when these  marks line up.  

In a third method, the E-gap is correct when a timing pin is  in place and red marks visible through a vent hole in the side  of the magneto case are aligned.  [Figure 4-51]  The contact  points should be just opening when the rotor is in the position  just described.  

Bench timing the magneto, or setting the E-gap, involves  positioning the magneto rotor at the E-gap position and  setting the breaker points to open when the timing lines or  marks provided for that purpose are perfectly aligned.

# High-Tension Magneto E-Gap Setting (Bench  Timing)  

The following steps are taken to check and adjust the timing  of the breaker points for the S-200 magneto, which does not  have timing marks in the breaker compartment:  

1.	 Remove the timing inspection plug from the top of  the magneto. Turn the rotating magnet in its normal  direction of rotation until the painted, chamfered tooth  on the distributor gear is approximately in the center  of the inspection window. Then, turn the magnet back  a few degrees until it is in its neutral position. Because  of its magnetism, the rotating magnet holds itself in  the neutral position. 2.	 Install the timing kit and place the pointer in the zero  position.  [Figure 4-52] 3.	 Connect a suitable timing light across the main breaker  points and turn the magnet in its normal direction of  rotation   $10^{\circ}$   as indicated by the pointer. This is the  E-gap position. The main breaker points should be  adjusted to open at this point. 4.	 Turn the rotating magnet until the cam follower is  at the highpoint on the cam lobe, and measure the  clearance between the breaker points. This clearance  must be   $0.018\,\,\mathrm{inh}\,\pm\,0.006$   inch [0.46 millimeter   $\mathrm{(mm)}\pm0.15\ \mathrm{mm]}$  . If the breaker point clearance is  not within these limits, the points must be adjusted  for correct setting. It is then necessary to recheck and  readjust the timing for breaker opening. If the breaker  points cannot be adjusted to open at the correct time,  they should be replaced.

# Timing the High-tension Magneto to the Engine  

When replacing magnetos on aircraft engines, two factors  must be considered:  

1.	 The internal timing of the magneto, including breaker  point adjustment, which must be correct to obtain  maximum potential voltage from the magneto. 2.	 The engine crankshaft position where the spark occurs.  The engine is usually timed by using the No. 1 cylinder  on the compression stroke.  

The magneto must be timed by first adjusting or checking the  internal timing with the magneto off the engine. This is done  by checking and adjusting the ignition points to open at the  E-gap position. The chamfered tooth should line up (reference  timing mark for the magneto) in the middle of the timing  window. The magneto is set to fire the No. 1 cylinder. Remove  the most accessible spark plug from the No. 1 cylinder. Pull  the propeller through in the direction of rotation until the No.  1 piston is coming up on the compression stroke. This can be  determined by holding a thumb over the spark plug hole until  the compression air is felt. Set the engine crankshaft at the  prescribed number of degrees ahead of true top dead center  as specified in the applicable manufacturer’s instruction,  usually using the timing marks on the engine. With the engine  set at a prescribed number of degrees ahead of true top dead  center on the compression stroke and with final movement  of the engine stopped in the direction of normal rotation,  the magneto can be installed on the engine.  [Figure 4-53]  

While holding the magneto drive in the firing position for the  No. 1 cylinder as indicated by the alignment of the reference  marks for the magneto, install the magneto drive into the  

![](images/13404365e46396e3d2e6ad86b0a216a13a2ed87078ba984cb0e683d1a1196bfd.jpg)  
Figure 4-53.   Timing marks aligned.  

engine drive. It should be installed in the middle of its slotted  flange to allow for fine timing of the magneto to the engine.  Attach a timing light to both magnetos. With the engine  still in the firing position, the magnetos should be timed by  moving them in the flange slots until the breaker points in the  magneto just open. If the slots in the mounting flange of the  magneto do not permit sufficient movement to effect breaker  point opening for the No. 1 cylinder, move the magneto out  of position far enough to permit turning the magneto drive  shaft. Then, install the magneto in position again and repeat  the previous check for point opening.  

Install the magneto attaching nuts on the studs and tighten  slightly. The nuts must not be tight enough to prevent the  movement of the magneto assembly when the magneto  mounting flange is tapped with a mallet. Reconnect the timing  light to the magneto and breaker points. With the light and  ignition switch turned on, rotate the magneto assembly first  in the direction of rotation and then in the opposite direction.  This is done to determine that the points just opened. After  completing this adjustment, tighten the mounting nuts. Move  the propeller one blade opposite the direction of rotation and  then, while observing the timing light, move the propeller  in the direction of rotation until the prescribed number of  degrees ahead of top dead center is reached. Be sure that the  lights for both sets of points come on points open, within the  prescribed timing position.  

Both right and left sets of breaker points should open at the  same instant, proper magneto-to-engine timing exists, and all  phases of magneto operation are synchronized. Some early  engines had what was referred to as staggered timing where  one magneto would fire at a different number of degrees  before top dead center on the compression stroke. In this  case, each magneto had to be timed separately. If staggered  ignition timing is used, the spark plug nearest the exhaust  valve will fire first.  

In the following example, a timing light is used for timing the  magneto to the engine. The timing light is designed in such  a way that one of two lights come on when the points open.  The timing light incorporates two lights. When connecting  the timing light to the magneto, the leads should be connected  so that the light on the right side of the box represents the  breaker points on the right magneto, and the light on the left  side represents the left magneto breaker points. The black lead  or ground lead must be attached to the engine or an effective  ground. When using the timing light to check a magneto in a  complete ignition system installed on the aircraft, the ignition  switch for the engine must be turned to both. Otherwise, the  lights do not indicate breaker point opening.  

# Performing Ignition System Checks  

The ignition system has checks performed on it during the  aircraft engine run-up, which is the engine check before  each flight. The magneto check, as it is usually referred to,  is performed during the engine run-up check list.  

One other check is accomplished prior to engine shutdown.  The ignition system check is used to check the individual  magnetos, harnesses, and spark plugs. After reaching the  engine rpm specified for the ignition system check, allow the  rpm to stabilize. Place the ignition switch in the right position  and note the rpm drop on the tachometer. Return the switch  to the both position. Allow the switch to remain in the both  position for a few seconds so that the rpm stabilizes again.  Place the ignition switch in the left position and again note the  rpm drop. Return the ignition switch to the both position. Note  the amount of total rpm drop that occurs for each magneto  position. The magneto drop should be even for both magnetos  and is generally in the area of a 25–75 rpm drop for each  magneto. Always refer to the aircraft operating manual for  specific information. This rpm drop is because operating on  one magneto combustion is not as efficient as it is with two  magnetos providing sparks in the cylinder.  

Remember, this tests not only the magnetos but also the  ignition leads and spark plugs. If either magneto has  excessive rpm drop while operating by itself, the ignition  system needs to be checked for problems. If only one  magneto has a high magneto drop, the problem can be  isolated and corrected by operating on that magneto. This  ignition system check is usually performed at the beginning  of the engine run-up because rpm drops not within the  prescribed limits affect later checks.  

# Ignition Switch Check  

The ignition switch check is performed to see that all  magneto ground leads are electrically grounded. The  ignition switch check is usually made at   $700\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . On those  aircraft engine installations that do not idle at this low rpm,  set the engine speed to the lowest possible to perform this  check. When the speed to perform this check is obtained,  momentarily turn the ignition switch to the off position.  The engine should completely quit firing. After a drop of   $200{-}300~\mathrm{rpm}$   is observed, return the switch to the both  position as rapidly as possible. Do this quickly to eliminate  the possibility of afterfire and backfire when the ignition  switch is returned to both.  

If the ignition switch is not returned quickly enough, the  engine rpm drops off completely and the engine stops. In  this case, leave the ignition switch in the off position and  place the mixture control in the idle-cutoff position to avoid  overloading the cylinders and exhaust system with raw fuel.  When the engine has completely stopped, allow it to remain  inoperative for a short time before restarting.  

If the engine does not cease firing in the off position, the  magneto ground lead, more commonly referred to as the  $\mathrm{P}$  lead, is open, and the trouble must be corrected. This means  that one or more of the magnetos are not being shut off even  when the ignition switch is in the off position. Turning the  propeller of this engine can result in personnel injury or  death. If the propeller is turned in this condition, the engine  can start with personnel in the propeller arch.  

# Maintenance & Inspection of Ignition Leads  

Inspection of ignition leads should include both a visual  and an electrical test. During the visual test, the lead cover  should be inspected for cracks or other damage, abrasions,  mutilated braid, or other physical damage. Inspect leads for  overheating if routed close to exhaust stacks. Disconnect the  harness coupling nuts from the top of the spark plugs and  remove the leads from the spark plug lead well. Inspect the  contact springs and compression springs for any damage  or distortion and the sleeves for cracks or carbon tracking.  The coupling nut that connects to the spark plug should be  inspected for damaged threads or other defects.  

Each lead should be checked for continuity using a high- tension lead tester by connecting the black lead to the contact  spring and the red lead to the eyelet of the same lead in the  cover. The continuity lamp on the tester should illuminate  when tested. The insulation resistance test of each lead is  accomplished using the high-tension lead tester by attaching  the red, or high-voltage, lead to the spring of the harness  lead. Then, attach the black lead to the ferrule of the same  lead. Depress the press-to-test push button switch on the lead  tester. Observe that the indictor lamp flashes and gap fires  simultaneously as long as the press-to-test switch is held in  the depressed position.  

If the indicator lamp flashes and the gap fails to fire, the lead  under test is defective and must be replaced. The indicator  lamp flashes to show that a high-voltage impulse was sent  out. If it fails to pass through the tester, then the electrical  pulse leaked through the wire showing it to be defective.  

When defective leads are revealed by an ignition harness test,  continue the test to determine whether the leads or distributor  block are defective. If the difficulty is in an individual ignition  lead, determine whether the electrical leak is at the spark plug  elbow or elsewhere. Remove the elbow, pull the ignition lead  out of the manifold a slight amount, and repeat the harness  test on the defective lead. If this stops the leakage, cut away  the defective portion of the lead and reinstall the elbow  assembly, integral seal, and terminal (sometimes referred to  as cigarette).  [Figure 4-54]  When installing the leads, you  should avoid bends because weak points may develop in  the insulation through which high-tension current can leak.  

If the lead is too short to repair in the manner described, or the  electrical leak is inside the harness, replace the defective lead.  Single ignition lead replacement procedures are as follows:  

1.	 Disassemble the magneto or distributor so that the  distributor block is accessible. 2.	 Loosen the piercing screw in the distributor block for  the lead to be replaced, and remove the lead from the  distributor block. 3.	 Remove approximately 1 inch of insulation from  

the distributor block end of the defective lead and  approximately 1 inch of insulation from the end of  the replacement cable. Splice this end to the end of  the lead to be replaced and solder the splice.  

4.	 Remove the elbow adapter from the spark plug end  of the defective lead, then pull the old lead out and  put the new lead into the harness. While pulling the  leads through the harness, have someone push the  replacement lead into the ignition manifold at the  distributor end to reduce the force required to pull the  lead through the ignition manifold.

 5.	 When the replacement lead has been pulled completely  through the manifold, force the ignition lead up into  the manifold from the distributor block end to provide  extra length for future repairs, which may be necessary  because of chafing at the spark plug elbow.

 6.	 Remove approximately   $\%$   inch of insulation from  the distributor block end. Bend the ends of the wire  back and prepare the ends of the cable for installation  into the distributor block well. Insert the lead in the  distributor and tighten the piercing screw.

 7.	 Remove approximately   $\%$   inch of insulation from  the spark plug end of the lead and install the elbow,  integral seal, and cigarette.  [Figure 4-54]

 8.	 Install a marker on the distributor end of the cable to  identify its cylinder number. If a new marker is not  available, use the marker removed from the defective  cable.

# Replacement of Ignition Harness  

Replace a complete ignition harness only when the  shielding of the manifold is damaged or when the number  of defective leads makes it more practical to replace the  harness than to replace the individual leads. Replace a cast- filled harness only when leakage in the cast-filled portion  is indicated. Before replacing any harness to correct engine  malfunctioning, make extensive ignition harness tests.  Typical procedures for installing an ignition harness are  detailed in the following paragraphs.  

Install the ignition harness on the engine. Tighten and safety  the hold down nuts and bolts and install and tighten the  individual lead brackets according to instructions. The ignition  harness is then ready for connection of the individual leads  to the distributor block. A band is attached to each lead at the  distributor end of the harness to identify the cylinder for the  lead. However, each lead should be checked individually with  a continuity or timing light prior to connecting it.  

Check for continuity by grounding the lead at the cylinder  and then checking at the distributor block end to establish that  the lead grounded is as designated on the band for the lead. After checking all leads for proper identification, cut them  to the proper length for installation into the distributor  block. Before cutting the leads, however, force them back  into the manifold as far as possible to provide surplus wire  in the ignition manifold. This extra wire may be needed at  a later date in the event that chafing of a lead at the spark  plug elbow necessitates cutting a short section of wire from  the spark plug end of the harness. After cutting each lead to  length, remove approximately  $\%$   inch of insulation from the  end and prepare the lead for insertion into the distributor  block. Before installing the lead, back out the set screw in  the distributor block far enough to permit slipping the end of  the wire into the hole without force. Insert the lead into the  block and tighten the set screw. Connect the wires in firing  order (the first cylinder to fire No. 1 location on the block,  the second in the firing order to No. 2 location, etc).  

After connecting each lead, check continuity between the  lead and its distributor block electrode with continuity light  or timing light. To perform one test lead, touch the other test  lead to the proper distributor block electrode. If the light does  not indicate a complete circuit, the set screw is not making  contact with the ignition wire or the lead is connected to the  wrong block location. Correct any faulty connections before  installing the distributor block.  

# Checking Ignition Induction Vibrator Systems  

To check the induction vibrator, ensure that the manual  mixture control is in idle cutoff, the fuel shutoff valve and  booster pump for that engine are in the off position, and the  battery switch is on. Since the induction vibrator buzzes  whether the ignition switch is on or off, leave the switch off  during the check. If the engine is equipped with an inertia or  combination starter, make the check by closing the engage  mesh switch; if the engine is equipped with a direct-cranking  starter, see that the propeller is clear and close the start switch.  An assistant stationed close to the induction vibrator should  listen for an audible buzzing sound. If the unit buzzes when  the starter is engaged or cranked, the induction vibrator is  operating properly.  

# Spark Plug Inspection & Maintenance  

Spark plug operation can often be a major source of engine  malfunctions because of lead, oil, graphite, carbon fouling,  and spark plug gap erosion. Most of these failures, which  usually accompany normal spark plug operation, can be  minimized by good operational and maintenance practices.  A spark plug is considered fouled if it has stopped allowing  the spark to bridge the gap either completely or intermittently.  

# Carbon Fouling of Spark Plugs  

Carbon fouling from fuel is associated with mixtures that  are too rich to burn or mixtures that are so lean they cause  intermittent firing.  [Figure 4-55]  Each time a spark plug does  not fire, raw fuel and oil collect on the nonfiring electrodes  and nose insulator. These difficulties are almost invariably  associated with an improper idle mixture adjustment, a  leaking primer, or carburetor malfunctions that cause too rich  a mixture in the idle range. A rich air-fuel mixture is detected  by soot or black smoke coming from the exhaust and by an  increase in rpm when the idling air-fuel mixture is leaned  to best power. The soot that forms as a result of overly rich   idle air-fuel mixtures settles on the inside of the combustion  chamber because the heat of the engine and the turbulence  

![](images/171f8ac44be507f435a7cd7cda1d782e802663e14394b69aaa2e4682bdb0a560.jpg)  
Figure 4-55.   Carbon fouled spark plug.  

in the combustion chamber are slight. At higher engine  speeds and powers, however, the soot is swept out and does  not condense out of the charge in the combustion chamber.  

# Oil Fouling of Spark Plugs  

Even though the idling air-fuel mixture is correct, there is a  tendency for oil to be drawn into the cylinder past the piston  rings, valve guides, and impeller shaft oil seal rings. At low  engine speeds, the oil combines with the soot in the cylinder  to form a solid that is capable of shorting out the spark plug.  Spark plugs that are wet or covered with lubricating oil are  usually grounded out during the engine start. In some cases,  these plugs may clear up and operate properly after a short  period of engine operation.  

Engine oil that has been in service for any length of time  holds in suspension minute carbon particles that are capable  of conducting an electric current. Thus, a spark plug will not  arc the gap between the electrodes when the plug is full of  oil. Instead, the high-voltage impulse flows through the oil  from one electrode to the other without a spark as though  a wire conductor were placed between the two electrodes.  Combustion in the affected cylinder does not occur until, at  a higher rpm, increased airflow has carried away the excess  oil. Then, when intermittent firing starts, combustion assists  in emitting the remaining oil. In a few seconds, the engine is  running clean with white fumes of evaporating and burning  oil coming from the exhaust.  

# Lead Fouling of Spark Plugs  

Lead fouling of aviation spark plugs is a condition likely  to occur in any engine using leaded fuels. Lead is added  to aviation fuel to improve its anti-knock qualities. The  lead, however, has the undesirable effect of forming lead  oxide during combustion. This lead oxide forms as a solid  with varying degrees of hardness and consistency. Lead  deposits on combustion chamber surfaces are good electrical  conductors at high temperatures and cause misfiring. At low  temperatures, the same deposits may be good insulators. In  either case, lead formations on aircraft spark plugs prevent  their normal operation.  [Figure 4-56]  To minimize the  formation of lead deposits, ethylene dibromide is added to  the fuel as a scavenging agent that combines with the lead  during combustion.  

Lead fouling may occur at any power setting, but perhaps the  power setting most conducive to lead fouling is cruising with  lean mixtures. At this power, the cylinder head temperature  is relatively low and there is more oxygen than needed to  consume all the fuel in the air-fuel mixture. Oxygen, when  hot, is very active and aggressive. When all the fuel has  been consumed, some of the excess oxygen unites with  some of the lead and some of the scavenger agent to form  

![](images/544da2861d90237c36212f9b2c1864ce2aa5b794f6352414c998ba2bb32df4da.jpg)  
Figure 4-56.   Lead fouled spark plug.  

oxygen compounds of lead or bromine or both. Some of  these undesirable lead compounds solidify and build up  in layers as they contact the relatively cool cylinder walls  and spark plugs. Although lead fouling may occur at any  power setting, experience indicates that the lead buildup  is generally confined to a specific combustion temperature  range. Combustion temperatures outside this specific range  minimize the lead fouling tendency.  

If lead fouling is detected before the spark plugs become  completely fouled, the lead can usually be eliminated  or reduced by either a sharp rise or a sharp decrease in  combustion temperature. This imposes a thermal shock on  cylinder parts, causing them to expand or contract. Since  there is a different rate of expansion between deposits and  metal parts on which they form, the deposits chip off or are  loosened and then scavenged from the combustion chamber  by the exhaust or are burned in the combustion process.  

Several methods of producing thermal shock to cylinder  parts are used. The method used depends on the accessory  equipment installed on the engine. A sharp rise in combustion  temperatures can be obtained on all engines by operating  them at full takeoff power for approximately 1 minute.  When using this method to eliminate fouling, the propeller  control must be placed in low pitch, or high rpm, and the  throttle advanced slowly to produce takeoff rpm and manifold  pressure. Slow movement of the throttle control provides  reasonable freedom from backfiring in the affected cylinders  during the application of power.  

Another method of producing thermal shock is the use of  excessively rich air-fuel mixtures. This method suddenly  cools the combustion chamber because the excess fuel does  not contribute to combustion; instead, it absorbs heat from  the combustion area. Some carburetor installations use two- position manual mixture controls that provide a lean mixture  setting for cruising economy and a richer mixture setting for  all powers above cruising. Neither manual mixture control  setting in this type of configuration is capable of producing  an excessively rich air-fuel mixture. Even when the engine  is operated in auto-rich at powers where an auto-lean setting  would be entirely satisfactory, the mixture is not rich enough.  

# Graphite Fouling of Spark Plugs  

As a result of careless and excessive application of thread  lubricant, called antiseize compound, to the spark plug, the  lubricant flows over the electrodes and causes shorting.  Shorting occurs because graphite is a good electrical  conductor. The elimination of service difficulties caused  by graphite is up to the aircraft technician. Use care when  applying the lubricant to make certain that smeared fingers,  shop towels, or brushes do not contact the electrodes or any  part of the ignition system except the spark plug threads.  Never apply to the first set of threads.  

# Gap Erosion of Spark Plugs  

Erosion of the electrodes takes place in all aircraft spark  plugs as the spark jumps the air gap between the electrodes.  [Figure 4-57]  

The spark carries with it a portion of the electrode, part of  which is deposited on the other electrode. The remainder  is blown off in the combustion chamber. As the airgap  is enlarged by erosion, the resistance that the spark must  

![](images/c6f05930132e5daf697ef25ae9017db526ad366d59912b6654832e97bab49b17.jpg)  
Figure 4-57.   Spark plug gap erosion.  

overcome in jumping the air gap also increases. This means  that the magneto must produce a higher voltage to overcome  the higher resistance. With higher voltages in the ignition  system, a greater tendency exists for the spark to discharge  at some weak insulation point in the ignition system. Since  the resistance of an air gap also increases as the pressure  in the engine cylinder increases, a double danger exists at  takeoff and during sudden acceleration with enlarged airgaps.  Insulation breakdown, premature flashover, and carbon  tracking result in misfiring of the spark plug and go hand in  hand with excessive spark plug gap. Wide gap settings also  raise the coming in speed of a magneto and therefore cause  hard starting.  

Spark plug manufacturers have partially overcome the  problem of gap erosion by using a hermetically sealed resistor  in the center electrode of spark plugs. This added resistance  in the high-tension circuit reduces the peak current at the  instant of firing. This reduced current flow helps prevent  metal disintegration in the electrodes. Also, due to the high  erosion rate of steel or any of its known alloys, spark plug  manufacturers are using tungsten or an alloy of nickel for  their massive electrode plugs and iridium/platinum plating  for their fine wire electrode plugs.  

# Spark Plug Removal  

Spark plugs should be removed for inspection and servicing  at the intervals recommended by the manufacturer. Since the  rate of gap erosion varies with different operating conditions,  engine models, and type of spark plug, engine malfunction  traceable to faulty spark plugs may occur before the regular  servicing interval is reached. Normally, in such cases, only  the faulty plugs are replaced.  

Since spark plugs can be easily damaged, careful handling  of the used and replacement plugs during installation  and removal of spark plugs from an engine cannot be  overemphasized. To prevent damage, spark plugs should  always be handled individually and new and reconditioned  plugs should be stored in separate cartons. A common method  of storage is illustrated in  Figure 4-58 . This is a drilled tray,  which prevents the plugs from bumping against one another  and damaging the fragile insulators and threads. Additionally,  the tray helps identify where the spark plug came from and  its proper rotation. If a plug is dropped on the floor or other  hard surface, it should not be installed in an engine, since  the shock of impact usually causes small, invisible cracks  in the insulators. A dropped spark plug should be discarded.  

Before a spark plug can be removed, the ignition harness lead  must be disconnected. Using the special spark plug coupling  elbow wrench, loosen and remove the spark plug to elbow  coupling nut from the spark plug. Take care to pull the lead  

![](images/9fb813145045a19fb2193c3a65f6d63e932fc5746ede0c55e66a9aba28daf644.jpg)

straight out and in line with the centerline of the plug barrel.  If a side load is applied, damage to the barrel insulator and  the ceramic lead terminal may result.  [Figure 4-59]  If the  lead cannot be removed easily in this manner, the neoprene  collar may be stuck to the shielding barrel. Break loose the  neoprene collar by twisting the collar as though it were a nut  being unscrewed from a bolt.  

![](images/cb9640e5279666ad11d1ed38c744adb6f21ef2e02a08f4d85b62289d6dd92ca7.jpg)

Figure 4-60.   Proper spark plug removal technique.  

After the lead has been disconnected, select the proper size  deep socket for spark plug removal. Apply steady pressure  with one hand on the hinge handle, holding the socket in  alignment with the other hand. Failure to hold the socket in  correct alignment causes the socket to tilt to one side and  damage the spark plug.  [Figure 4-60]  

In the course of engine operation, carbon and other products of  combustion are deposited across the spark plug and cylinder,  and some carbon may even penetrate the lower threads of the  shell. As a result, a high torque is generally required to break  the spark plug loose. This factor imposes a shearing load on  the shell section of the plug. After removing the plugs, they  should be placed in a spark plug tray.  [Figure 4-58]  

# Spark Plug Reconditioning Service  

A visual inspection should be the first step in servicing  spark plugs. The threads on the shielding barrel and on the  shell that screws into the cylinder should be inspected for  damaged or nicked threads. Inspect the lead shielding barrel  for corrosion, nicks, and cracks. The firing end should be  checked for insulator cracks, chips, and excessive electrode  wear. The shell hex or wrench hex should be checked to see  if it is rounded off or mutilated. If the spark plug passes the  visual check, then it should be degreased using petroleum  solvent. Take care to keep solvent out of the shielding barrel.  

Never soak the plugs in solvent. After drying the firing end  of the plugs, remove the lead compound deposits using a  vibrator cleaner.  [Figure 4-61]  The firing end can now be  cleaned by using an abrasive blaster. This is usually done  using a spark plug cleaner tester.  [Figure 4-62]  As the  firing end is subjected to the abrasive blast, the plug should  be rotated so all the area of the firing end is cleaned. After  the abrasive blast, the firing end gets a thorough air blast to  remove the abrasive material. The shielding barrel insulators  may be cleaned with a cotton cloth or felt swab saturated with  solvent, wood alcohol, or other approved cleaner. The firing  end should be inspected using a light and a magnifying glass.  If the plug passes the firing end visual and cleaning checks,  then the spark gap should be set using a round thickness

gauge. The spark plug should be tested by using a tester as  shown in  Figure 4-62 , which passes a high-voltage through  the spark plug and fire the gap. As this test takes place, the  firing end of the plug is subjected to air pressure to simulate  the pressure in the engine’s cylinder. If the firing pattern  is good, the plug should be returned to its holder ready for  installation in the engine.  

# Inspection Prior to Installation  

Before installing new or reconditioned spark plugs in the  engine cylinders, clean the spark plug bushings or Heli- Coil inserts.  

Brass or stainless steel spark plug bushings are usually  cleaned with a spark plug bushing cleanout tap. Before  inserting the cleanout tap in the spark plug hole, fill the flutes  of the tap, or channels between threads, with clean grease to  prevent hard carbon or other material removed by the tap from  dropping into the inside of the cylinder. Align the tap with the  bushing threads by sight where possible, and start the tap by  hand until there is no possibility of it being cross-threaded in  the bushing. To start the tap on installations where the spark  plug hole is located deeper than can be reached by a clenched  hand, it may be necessary to use a short length of hose slipped  over the square end of the tap to act as an extension. When  screwing the tap into the bushing, be sure that the full tap  cutting thread reaches the bottom thread of the bushing. This  removes carbon deposits from the bushing threads without  removing bushing metal, unless the pitch diameter of the  threads has contracted as the result of shrinkage or some  other unusual condition. Replace the cylinder if, during the  thread-cleaning process, the bushing is found to be loose,  loosened in the cylinder, or the threads are cross-threaded  or otherwise seriously damaged.  

Spark plug Heli-Coil inserts are cleaned with a round wire  brush, preferably one having a diameter slightly larger than  the diameter of the spark plug hole. A brush considerably  larger than the hole may cause removal of material from  the Heli-Coil proper or from the cylinder head surrounding  the insert. Also, the brush should not disintegrate with use,  allowing wire bristles to fall into the cylinder. Clean the insert  by carefully rotating the wire brush with a power tool. When  using the power brush, be careful that no material is removed  from the spark plug gasket seating surface, since this may  cause a change in the spark plug’s heat range, combustion  leakage, and eventual cylinder damage. Never clean the Heli- Coil inserts with a cleaning tap, since permanent damage to  the insert results. If a Heli-Coil insert is damaged as a result  of normal operation or while cleaning it, replace it according  to the applicable manufacturer’s instructions.  

Using a lint-free rag and cleaning solvent, wipe the spark  plug gasket seating surface of the cylinder to eliminate the  possibility of dirt or grease being accidentally deposited on  the spark plug electrodes at the time of installation.  

Before the new or reconditioned plugs are installed, they must  be inspected for each of the following conditions:  

1.	 Ensure that the plug is of the approved type,  as indicated by the applicable manufacturer’s  instructions. 2.	 Check for evidence of rust-preventive compound  on the spark plug exterior and core insulator and on  the inside of the shielding barrel. Rust-preventive  compound accumulations are removed by washing  the plug with a brush and cleaning solvent. It must  then be dried with a dry air blast. 3.	 Check both ends of the plug for nicked or cracked  threads and any indication of cracks in the nose  insulator.  

4.	 Inspect the inside of the shielding barrel for cracks in  the barrel insulator, and the center electrode contact  for rust and foreign material that might cause poor  electrical contact.  

5.	 Install a new spark plug gasket. When the thermocouple  gasket is used, do not use an additional gasket.  

The gap setting should be checked with a round wire- thickness gauge.  [Figure 4-63]  A flat-type gauge gives an  incorrect clearance indication because the massive ground  electrodes are contoured to the shape of the round center  electrode. When using the wire thickness gauge, insert the  gauge in each gap parallel to the centerline of the center  electrode. If the gauge is tilted slightly, the indication is  incorrect. Do not install a plug that does not have an air gap  within the specified clearance range.  

# Spark Plug Installation  

Prior to spark plug installation, carefully coat the first two  or three threads from the electrode end of the shell with a  graphite base antiseize compound. Prior to application, stir  the antiseize compound to ensure thorough mixing. When  applying the antiseize compound to the threads, be extremely  careful that none of the compound gets on the ground,  center electrodes, or on the nose of the plug, where it can  spread to the ground or center electrode during installation.  This precaution is mentioned because the graphite in the  compound is an excellent electrical conductor and could  cause permanent fouling.  

To install a spark plug, start it into the cylinder without using  a wrench of any kind, and turn it until the spark plug is seated  on the gasket. If you can screw the plug into the cylinder with  comparative ease using your fingers, this indicates good,  clean threads. In this case, only a small amount of additional  tightening torque is needed to compress the gasket to form  a gastight seal. If a high torque is needed to install the plug,  dirty or damaged threads on either the plug or plug bushing  are indicated. The use of excessive torque might compress  

![](images/b0224ec644d395eb51e81dd60a2e6c49682ae995e3b45160fc16755177680a2b.jpg)  
Figure 4-63.   Wire gap gauge.  

the gasket out of shape and distort and stretch the plug shell  to a point where breakage would result during the next  removal or installation. Shell stretching occurs as excessive  torque continues to screw the lower end of the shell into the  cylinder after the upper end has been stopped by the gasket  shoulder. As the shell stretches, the seal between the shell  and core insulator is opened, creating a loss of gas tightness  or damage to the core insulator. After a spark plug has been  seated with the fingers, use a torque wrench and tighten to  the specified torque.  [Figure 4-64]  

# Spark Plug Lead Installation  

Before installing the spark plug lead, carefully wipe the  terminal sleeve and the integral seal with a cloth moistened  with acetone or an approved solvent. After the plug lead is  cleaned, inspect it for cracks and scratches. If the terminal  sleeve is damaged or heavily stained, replace it.  

Application of a light coating of an insulating material to the  outer surface of the terminal sleeve, as well as filling the space  occupied by the contact spring, is sometimes recommended.  By occupying the space in the electrical contact area of the  shielding barrel, the insulating material prevents moisture  from entering the contact area and shorting the spark plug.  

![](images/82635707a5edd8bbf07641729d5738c66e1ad4d511fd4d1325d85029a694c718.jpg)  
Figure 4-64.   Effect of excessive torque in installing a spark plug.  

Some manufacturers recommend the use of such insulating  compounds only when moisture in the ignition system  becomes a problem, and others have discontinued the use  of such materials.  

After inspection of the spark plug lead, slip the lead into  the shielding barrel of the plug with care. Then, tighten the  spark plug coupling elbow nut with the proper tool. Most  manufacturers’ instructions specify the use of a tool designed  to help prevent an overtorque condition. After the coupling  nut is tightened, avoid checking for tightness by twisting the  body of the elbow.  

After all plugs have been installed, torqued, and the leads  properly installed, start the engine and perform a complete  ignition system operational check.  

# Breaker Point Inspection  

Inspection of the magneto consists essentially of a periodic  breaker point and dielectric inspection. After the magneto  has been inspected for security of mounting, remove the  magneto cover, or breaker cover, and check the cam for  proper lubrication. Under normal conditions, there is usually  ample oil in the felt oiler pad of the cam follower to keep  the cam lubricated between overhaul periods. However,  during the regular routine inspection, examine the felt pad  on the cam follower to be sure it contains sufficient oil for  cam lubrication. Make this check by pressing the thumbnail  against the oiler pad. If oil appears on the thumbnail, the  pad contains sufficient oil for cam lubrication. If there is no  evidence of oil on the fingernail, apply one drop of a light  aircraft engine oil to the bottom felt pad and one drop to the  upper felt pad of the follower assembly.  [Figure 4-65]  

After application, allow at least 15 minutes for the felt to  absorb the oil. At the end of 15 minutes, blot off any excess  oil with a clean, lint-free cloth. During this operation, or any  time the magneto cover is off, use extreme care to keep the  breaker compartment free of oil, grease, or engine cleaning  solvents, since each of these have an adhesiveness that  collects dirt and grime that could foul an otherwise good set  of breaker contact points.  

![](images/54bc6cc442b57793b4486c098f545e21093579d9b2da36ec0628f57a54e6548d.jpg)  
Figure 4-65.   Felt lubricator.  

After the felt oiler pad has been inspected, serviced, and  found to be satisfactory, visually inspect the breaker contacts  for any condition that may interfere with proper operation  of the magneto. If the inspection reveals an oily or gummy  substance on the sides of the contacts, swab the contacts with  a flexible wiper, such as a pipe cleaner dipped in acetone  or other approved solvent. By forming a hook on the end  of the wiper, ready access can be gained to the back side of  the contacts.  

To clean the contact mating surfaces, force open the breaker  points enough to admit a small swab. Whether spreading the  points for purposes of cleaning or checking the surfaces for  condition, always apply the opening force at the outer end of  the mainspring and never spread the contacts more than  1 ⁄   16 inch. If the contacts are spread wider than recommended, the  mainspring, the spring carrying the movable contact point,  is likely to take a permanent set. If the mainspring takes a  permanent set, the movable contact point loses some of its  closing tension and the points then either bounce or float,  preventing the normal induction buildup of the magneto.  

A swab can be made by wrapping a piece of linen tape or  a small piece of lint-free cloth over one of the leaves of  a clearance gauge and dipping the swab in an approved  solvent. Pass the swab between the carefully separated  contact surfaces until the surfaces are clean. During this  entire operation, take care that drops of solvent do not fall  on lubricated parts, such as the cam, follower block, or felt  oiler pad.  

To inspect the breaker contact surfaces, it is necessary to  know what a normal operating set of contacts looks like,  what surface condition is considered as permissible wear, and  what surface condition is cause for dressing or replacement.  The probable cause of an abnormal surface condition can be  determined from the contact appearance. The normal contact  surface has a dull gray, sandblasted, almost rough appearance  over the area where electrical contact is made.  [Figure 4-66]   This gray, sandblasted appearance indicates that the points  have worn in and have mated to each other and are providing  the best possible electrical contact. This does not imply that  this is the only acceptable contact surface condition. Slight,  smooth-surfaced irregularities, without deep pits or high  peaks, such as shown in  Figure 4-67 , are considered normal  wear and are not cause for replacement.  

However, when wear advances to a point where the slight,  smooth irregularities develop into well-defined peaks  extending noticeably above the surrounding surface, the  breaker contacts must be replaced.  [Figure 4-68]  

Unfortunately, when a peak forms on one contact, the mating

contact has a corresponding pit or hole. This pit is more  troublesome than the peak because it penetrates the platinum  pad of the contact surface. It is sometimes difficult to judge  whether a contact surface is pitted deeply enough to require  replacement because this depends on how much of the  original platinum is left on the contact surface. The danger  arises from the possibility that the platinum pad may already  be thin as a result of long service life and previous dressings. At overhaul facilities, a gauge is used to measure the  remaining thickness of the pad, and no difficulty in  determining the condition of the pad exists. But at line  maintenance activities, this gauge is generally unavailable.  

Therefore, if the peak is quite high or the pit quite deep,  remove and replace them with a new assembly. A comparison  between  Figures 4-67  and   $_{\mathcal{A}-68}$    will help to draw the line  between minor irregularities and well-defined peaks.  

Some examples of possible breaker contact surface conditions  are illustrated in  Figure 4-69 . Item A illustrates an example  of erosion or wear called frosting. This condition results from  an open-circuited condenser and is easily recognized by the  coarse, crystalline surface and the black “sooty” appearance  of the sides of the points. The lack of effective condenser  action results in an arc of intense heat being formed each  time the points open. This, together with the oxygen in the  air, rapidly oxidizes and erodes the platinum surface of the  points, producing the coarse, crystalline, or frosted appearance.  Properly operating points have a fine-grained, frosted, or  silvery appearance and should not be confused with the coarse- grained and sooty point caused by faulty condenser action.  

Figure 4-69B  and  $C$   illustrate badly pitted points. In the early  stage, these points are identified by a fairly even contact edge  and minute pits or pocks in or near the center of the contact  surface with an overall smoky appearance. In more advanced  stages, the pit may develop into a large, jagged crater, and  eventually the entire contact surface takes on a burned, black,  and crumpled appearance. Pitted points, as a general rule,  are caused by dirt and impurities on the contact surfaces. If  points are excessively pitted, a new breaker assembly must  be installed.  

Figure   $_{4-69E}$   illustrates a built-up point that can be  recognized by the mound of metal that has been transferred  from one point to another. Buildup, like the other conditions  mentioned, results primarily from the transfer of contact  material by means of the arc as the points separate. But, unlike  the others, there is no burning or oxidation in the process  because of the closeness of the pit of one point and the buildup  of the other. This condition may result from excessive breaker  point spring tension that retards the opening of the points or  causes a slow, lazy break. It can also be caused by a poor  primary condenser or a loose connection at the primary coil.  If excessive buildup has occurred, a new breaker assembly  must be installed.  

Figure  $_{4-69F}$   illustrates oily points that can be recognized  by their smoked and smudged appearance and by the lack of  any of the previously mentioned irregularities. This condition  may be the result of excessive cam lubrication or of oil  vapors that may come from within or outside the magneto.  A smoking or fuming engine, for example, could produce the  oil vapors. These vapors then enter the magneto through the  magneto ventilator and pass between and around the points.  These conductive vapors produce arcing and burning on the

contact surfaces. The vapors also adhere to the other surfaces  of the breaker assembly and form the sooty deposit. If so,  install new breaker assembly.  

# Dielectric Inspection  

Another phase of magneto inspection is the dielectric  inspection. This inspection is a visual check for cleanliness  and cracks. If inspection reveals that the coil cases,  condensers, distributor rotor, or blocks are oily or dirty or  have any trace of carbon tracking, they require cleaning and  possibly waxing to restore their dielectric qualities.  

Clean all accessible condensers and coil cases that contain  condensers by wiping them with a lint-free cloth moistened  with acetone. Many parts of this type have a protective  coating. This protective coating is not affected by acetone, but  it may be damaged by scraping or by the use of other cleaning  fluids. Never use unapproved cleaning solvents or improper  cleaning methods. Also, when cleaning condensers or parts  that contain condensers, do not dip, submerge, or saturate  the parts in any solution because the solution used may seep  inside the condenser and short out the plates.  

Coil cases, distributor blocks, distributor rotors, and other  dielectric parts of the ignition system are treated with a wax  coating when they are new and again at overhaul. The waxing  of dielectrics aids their resistance to moisture absorption,  carbon tracking, and acid deposits. When these parts become  dirty or oily, some of the original protection is lost, and carbon  tracking may result.  

If any hairline carbon tracks or acid deposits are present on the  surface of the dielectric, immerse the part in approved cleaning  solvent and scrub it vigorously with a stiff bristle brush. When  the carbon track or acid deposits have been removed, wipe the  part with a clean, dry cloth to remove all traces of the solvent  used for cleaning. Then, coat the part with a special ignition- treating wax. After wax treating the part, remove excess wax  deposits and reinstall the part in the magneto.  

# Ignition Harness Maintenance  

Although the ignition harness is simple, it is a vital link  between the magneto and spark plug. Because the harness  is mounted on the engine and exposed to the atmosphere, it  is vulnerable to heat, moisture, and the effects of changing  altitude. These factors, plus aging insulation and normal  gap erosion, work against efficient engine operation. The  insulation may break down on a wire inside the harness and  allow the high-voltage to leak through the insulation to the  harness shielding instead of going to the spark plug. Open  circuits may result from broken wires or poor connections.  A bare wire may be in physical contact with the shielding,  or two wires may be shorted together.  

Any serious defect in an individual lead prevents the high- tension impulse from reaching the spark plug to which the  lead is connected. As a result, this plug will not fire. When  only one spark plug is firing in a cylinder, the charge is  not consumed as quickly as it would be if both plugs were  firing. This factor causes the peak pressure of combustion to  occur later on in the power stroke. If the peak pressure in the  cylinder occurs later, a loss of power in that cylinder results.  However, the power loss from a single cylinder becomes a  minor factor when the effects of a longer burning time is  considered. A longer burning time overheats the affected  cylinder, causing detonation, possible pre-ignition, and  perhaps permanent damage to the cylinder.  

# High-Tension Ignition Harness Faults  

Perhaps the most common and most difficult high-tension  ignition system faults to detect are high-voltage leaks. This  is leakage from the core conductor through insulation to the  ground of the shielded manifold. A certain small amount of  leakage exists even in brand new ignition cable during normal  operation. Various factors combine to produce first a high rate  of leakage and then complete breakdown. Of these factors,  moisture in any form is probably the worst.  

Under high-voltage stress, an arc forms and burns a path  across the insulator where the moisture exists. If there is  gasoline, oil, or grease present, it breaks down and forms  carbon. The burned path is called a carbon track, since it  is actually a path of carbon particles. With some types of  insulation, it may be possible to remove the carbon track  and restore the insulator to its former useful condition. This  is generally true of porcelain, ceramics, and some of the  plastics because these materials are not hydrocarbons and  any carbon track forming on them is the result of a dirt film  that can be wiped away.  

Differences in location and amount of leakage produce  different indications of malfunction during engine operation.  Indications are generally misfiring or crossfiring. The  indication may be intermittent, changing with manifold  pressure or with climate conditions. An increase in manifold  pressure increases the compression pressure and the resistance  of the air across the air gap of the spark plugs. An increase in  the resistance at the air gap opposes the spark discharge and  produces a tendency for the spark to discharge at some weak  point in the insulation. A weak spot in the harness may be  aggravated by moisture collecting in the harness manifold.  With moisture present, continued engine operation causes the  intermittent faults to become permanent carbon tracks. Thus,  the first indication of ignition harness un service ability may  be engine misfiring or roughness caused by partial leakage  of the ignition voltage.  

Figure 4-70  demonstrates four faults that may occur. Fault A  shows a short from one cable conductor to another. This fault  usually causes misfiring, since the spark is short circuited to  a plug in a cylinder where the cylinder pressure is low. Fault  B illustrates a cable with a portion of its insulation scuffed  away. Although the insulation is not completely broken  down, more than normal leakage exists, and the spark plug  to which this cable is connected may be lost during takeoff  when the manifold pressure is quite high. Fault C is the  result of condensation collecting in the lowest portion of  the ignition manifold. This condensation may completely  evaporate during engine operation, but the carbon track that  is formed by the initial flashover remains to allow continued  flashover whenever high manifold pressure exists. Fault  D may be caused by a flaw in the insulation or the result  of a weak spot in the insulation that is aggravated by the  presence of moisture. However, since the carbon track is in  

![](images/7cfa9d54ae8049b938162e018bae71b0a01d3d1680c01849f809783165372276.jpg)  
Figure 4-70.   Cross section of an ignition harness.  

direct contact with the metal shielding, it probably results in  flashover under all operating conditions.  

# Harness Testing  

The electrical test of the ignition harness checks the condition  or effectiveness of the insulation around each cable in the  harness.  [Figure 4-71]  This test involves application of a  definite voltage to each lead, and then measurement with  a very sensitive meter of the amount of current leakage  between the lead and the grounded harness manifold. This  reading, when compared with known specifications, becomes  a guide to the condition or serviceability of the cable. As  mentioned earlier, there is a gradual deterioration of flexible  insulating material. When new, the insulation has a low rate  of conductivity; so low that, under several thousand volts  of electrical pressure, the current leakage is only a very few  millionths of an ampere. Natural aging causes an extremely  slow, but certain, change in the resistance of insulating  material, allowing an ever-increasing rate of current leakage.  The procedures for testing ignition harness and leads were  discussed earlier in this chapter.

# Turbine Engine Ignition Systems  

Since turbine ignition systems are operated mostly for a  brief period during the engine-starting cycle, they are, as a  rule, more trouble-free than the typical reciprocating engine  ignition system. The turbine engine ignition system does  not need to be timed to spark during an exact point in the  operational cycle. It is used to ignite the fuel in the combustor  and then it is switched off. Other modes of turbine ignition  system operation, such as continuous ignition that is used  at a lower voltage and energy level, are used for certain  flight conditions.  

Continuous ignition is used in case the engine were to flame  out. This ignition could relight the fuel and keep the engine  from stopping. Examples of critical flight modes that use  continuous ignition are takeoff, landing, and some abnormal  and emergency situations.  

Most gas turbine engines are equipped with a high-energy,  capacitor-type ignition system and are air cooled by fan  airflow. Fan air is ducted to the exciter box, and then flows  around the igniter lead and surrounds the igniter before  flowing back into the nacelle area. Cooling is important when  continuous ignition is used for some extended period of time.  Gas turbine engines may be equipped with an electronic-type  ignition system, which is a variation of the simpler capacitor- type system.  

The typical turbine engine is equipped with a capacitor-type,  or capacitor discharge, ignition system consisting of two  identical independent ignition units operating from a common  low-voltage (DC) electrical power source: the aircraft battery,  115AC, or its permanent magnet generator. The generator  is turned directly by the engine through the accessory gear  box and produces power any time the engine is turning.  The fuel in turbine engines can be ignited readily in ideal  atmospheric conditions, but since they often operate in the  low temperatures of high altitudes, it is imperative that the  system be capable of supplying a high heat intensity spark.  Thus, a high-voltage is supplied to arc across a wide igniter  spark gap, providing the ignition system with a high degree  of reliability under widely varying conditions of altitude,  atmospheric pressure, temperature, fuel vaporization, and  input voltage.  

A typical ignition system includes two exciter units, two  transformers, two intermediate ignition leads, and two high- tension leads. Thus, as a safety factor, the ignition system  is actually a dual system designed to fire two igniter plugs.  [Figure 4-72]  

Figure 4-73  is a functional schematic diagram of a typical  older style capacitor-type turbine ignition system. A 24-volt  

![](images/7c1ca13536f7c7fb2435ac0342e6b767fb4099a20da4e652a2d7149643d394a3.jpg)  
Figure 4-72.   Turbine ignition system components.  

DC input voltage is supplied to the input receptacle of the  exciter unit. Before the electrical energy reaches the exciter  unit, it passes through a filter that prevents noise voltage  from being induced into the aircraft electrical system. The  low-voltage input power operates a DC motor that drives  one multilobe cam and one single-lobe cam. At the same  time, input power is supplied to a set of breaker points that  are actuated by the multilobe cam.  

From the breaker points, a rapidly interrupted current is  delivered to an auto transformer. When the breaker closes,  the flow of current through the primary winding of the  transformer establishes a magnetic field. When the breaker  opens, the flow of current stops, and the collapse of the field  induces a voltage in the secondary of the transformer. This  voltage causes a pulse of current to flow into the storage  capacitor through the rectifier, which limits the flow to a  single direction. With repeated pulses, the storage capacitor  assumes a charge, up to a maximum of approximately 4  joules. (Note: 1 joule per second equals 1 watt.) The storage  capacitor is connected to the spark igniter through the  triggering transformer and a contactor, normally open.  

When the charge on the capacitor has built up, the contactor  is closed by the mechanical action of the single-lobe cam.  A portion of the charge flows through the primary of the  triggering transformer and the capacitor connected with it.  This current induces a high-voltage in the secondary, which  ionizes the gap at the spark igniter.  

When the spark igniter is made conductive, the storage  capacitor discharges the remainder of its accumulated energy  along with the charge from the capacitor in series with the  primary of the triggering transformer. The spark rate at the  

![](images/922a40fe6179468aa54c445d7b85c90fcd2d2e93ebc28be326a501f6736eec03.jpg)  
Figure 4-73.   Capacitor-type ignition system schematic.  

spark igniter varies in proportion to the voltage of the DC  power supply that affects the rpm of the motor. However,  since both cams are geared to the same shaft, the storage  capacitor always accumulates its store of energy from the  same number of pulses before discharge. The employment  of the high-frequency triggering transformer, with a low- reactance secondary winding, holds the time duration of the  discharge to a minimum. This concentration of maximum  energy in minimum time achieves an optimum spark for  ignition purposes, capable of blasting carbon deposits and  vaporizing globules of fuel.  

All high-voltage in the triggering circuits is completely  isolated from the primary circuits. The complete exciter is  hermetically sealed, protecting all components from adverse  operating conditions, eliminating the possibility of flashover  at altitude due to pressure change. This also ensures shielding  against leakage of high-frequency voltage interfering with  the radio reception of the aircraft.  

# Capacitor Discharge Exciter Unit  

This capacity-type system provides ignition for turbine  engines. Like other turbine ignition systems, it is required  only for starting the engine; once combustion has begun, the  flame is continuous.  [Figure 4-74]  

The energy is stored in capacitors. Each discharge circuit  incorporates two storage capacitors; both are located in the  exciter unit. The voltage across these capacitors is stepped  up by transformer units. At the instant of igniter plug firing,  the resistance of the gap is lowered sufficiently to permit the  larger capacitor to discharge across the gap. The discharge  of the second capacitor is of low-voltage, but of very high  

![](images/082554d4ecde8c6a700b6cc6153854a65006dec0b3d9abf173b1e56b7949c87a.jpg)  
Figure 4-74.   Fan air-cooled exciter.  

energy. The result is a spark of great heat intensity, capable  of not only igniting abnormal fuel mixtures but also burning  away any foreign deposits on the plug electrodes.  

The exciter is a dual unit that produces sparks at each of the  two igniter plugs. A continuous series of sparks is produced  until the engine starts. The power is then cut off, and the  plugs do not fire while the engine is operating other than on  continuous ignition for certain flight conditions. This is why  the exciters are air cooled to prevent overheating during long  use of continuous ignition.  

# Igniter Plugs  

The igniter plug of a turbine engine ignition system differs  considerably from the spark plug of a reciprocating engine  ignition system.  [Figure 4-75]  Its electrode must be  capable of withstanding a current of much higher energy  than the electrode of a conventional spark plug. This high  energy current can quickly cause electrode erosion, but the  short periods of operation minimize this aspect of igniter  maintenance. The electrode gap of the typical igniter plug  is designed much larger than that of a spark plug since the  operating pressures are much lower and the spark can arc  more easily than in a spark plug. Finally, electrode fouling,  common to the spark plug, is minimized by the heat of the  high-intensity spark.  

Figure 4-76  is a cutaway illustration of a typical annular-gap  igniter plug, sometimes referred to as a long reach igniter  because it projects slightly into the combustion chamber liner  to produce a more effective spark.  

Another type of igniter plug, the constrained-gap plug, is used  in some types of turbine engines.  [Figure 4-77]  It operates  at a much cooler temperature because it does not project into  the combustion-chamber liner. This is possible because the  spark does not remain close to the plug, but arcs beyond the  face of the combustion chamber liner.  

# Turbine Ignition System Inspection &  Maintenance  

Maintenance of the typical turbine engine ignition system  consists primarily of inspection, test, troubleshooting,  removal, and installation.  

# Inspection  

Inspection of the ignition system normally includes the  following:  

![](images/a56674023059bb2b6e11d7be952585b833d97d6e21a4f20997c35008fbbb5001.jpg)  
Figure 4-75.   Igniter plugs.  

•	 Ignition lead terminal inspection; ceramic terminal  should be free of arcing, carbon tracking and cracks.  •	 The grommet seal should be free of flashover and  carbon tracking.  [Figure 4-78]  •	 The wire insulation should remain flexible with no  evidence of arcing through the insulation.  •	 Inspect the complete system for security of component  mounting, shorts or high-voltage arcing, and loose  connections.  

# Check System Operation  

The igniter can be checked by listening for a snapping noise  as the engine begins to turn, driven by the starter. Though  the following procedure is not common practice and should  only be used when the maintenance manual suggests it as  an alternative method, the igniter can also be checked by  removing it and activating the start cycle, noting the spark  across the igniter.  

Caution:  The high energy level and voltage associated  with turbine ignition systems can cause injury or death to  personnel coming into contact with the activated system.  

![](images/df8d790a710e5668e221f53d6e98a00f1e73f48ed34876320c0a9aa8d12cea4d.jpg)

# Repair  

Tighten and secure as required and replace faulty components  and wiring. Secure, tighten, and safety as required.  

# Removal, Maintenance, & Installation of  Ignition System Components  

The following instructions are typical procedures suggested  by many gas turbine manufacturers. These instructions are  applicable to the engine ignition components. Always consult  the applicable manufacturer’s instructions before performing  any ignition system maintenance.  

# Ignition System Leads  

1.	 Remove clamps securing ignition leads to engine. 2.	 Remove safety wire and disconnect electrical  connectors from exciter units.  

![](images/a2dc897421d244fcd35efb86133ad046612eab5b65654bba8dcc8dcb38cfcbca.jpg)  
Figure 4-77.   Constrained gap igniter plug.  

3.	 Remove safety wire and disconnect lead from igniter  plug.

 4.	 Discharge any electrical charge stored in the system  by grounding and remove ignition leads from engine. 

 5.	 Clean leads with approved dry cleaning solvent.

 6.	 Inspect connectors for damaged threads, corrosion,  cracked insulators, and bent or broken connector pins.

 7.	 Inspect leads for worn or burned areas, deep cuts,  fraying, and general deterioration. 

 8.	 Perform continuity check of ignition leads. 

 9.	 Reinstall leads, reversing the removal procedure.  

# Igniter Plugs  

1.	 Disconnect ignition leads from igniter plugs. A good  procedure to perform before disconnecting the ignition  lead is to disconnect the low-voltage primary lead  

![](images/2c72d0d26ac295bca133c1a81699d4a22ee15da15e6a5e2695cd643c24c87c08.jpg)

minute to permit the stored energy to dissipate before  disconnecting the high-voltage cable from the igniter. 2.	 Remove igniter plugs from mounts. 3.	 Inspect igniter plug gap surface material. Before  inspection, remove residue from the shell exterior  using a dry cloth. Do not remove any deposits or  residue from the firing end of the low-voltage igniters.  High-voltage igniters can have the firing end cleaned  to aid in inspection.  [Figure 4-79]  4.	 Inspect for fretting of igniter plug shank. 5.	 Replace an igniter plug whose surface is granular,  chipped, or otherwise damaged. 6.	 Replace dirty or carbonized igniter plugs. 7.	 Install igniter plugs in mounting pads. 8.	 Check for proper clearance between chamber liner  and igniter plug. 9.	 Tighten igniter plugs to manufacturer’s specified  torque. 10.	 Safety wire igniter plugs.  

# Powerplant Electrical Systems  

The satisfactory performance of any modern aircraft depends  to a great degree on the continuing reliability of electrical  systems and subsystems. Improperly or carelessly installed  or maintained wiring can be a source of both immediate  and potential danger. The continued proper performance of  electrical systems depends upon the knowledge and technique  of the mechanic who installs, inspects, and maintains the  electrical wire and cable of the electrical systems.  

The procedures and practices outlined in this section are  general recommendations and are not intended to replace the  manufacturer’s instructions in approved practices.  

![](images/1b92e5f2117ae6431d9284931b9b3fb2d025e23b69383f6630b61204cb8e1c3a.jpg)  

For the purpose of this discussion, a wire is described as a  single solid conductor, or a stranded conductor, covered with  an insulating material.  [Figure 4-80]  The term “cable,” as  used in aircraft electrical installations, includes the following:  

1.	 Multiconductor cable—two or more separately  insulated conductors in the same jacket. 2.	 Twisted pair—two or more separately insulated  conductors twisted together. 3.	 Shielded cable—one or more insulated conductors,  covered with a metallic braided shield. 4.	 Radio frequency cable—a single, insulated center  conductor with a metallic braided outer conductor.  The concentricity of the center conductor and the outer  conductor is carefully controlled during manufacture  to ensure that they are coaxial.  

# Wire Size  

Wire is manufactured in sizes according to a standard known  as the American wire gauge (AWG). The wire diameters  become smaller as the gauge numbers become larger. The  largest wire size shown in  Figure 4-81  is number 0000,  

![](images/4710e2b12ea9bb7dce30906669fac4387b385a4b07b473bc91b7e531e0c21d39.jpg)  
Figure 4-80.   Two types of aircraft wire.  

and the smallest is number 40. Larger and smaller sizes are  manufactured but are not commonly used.  

Wire size may be determined by using a wire gauge.  [Figure 4-82]  This type of gauge measures wires ranging  in size from number 0 (zero) to number 36. The wire to be  measured is inserted in the smallest slot that just accommodates  the bare wire. The gauge number corresponding to that slot  indicates the wire size. The slot has parallel sides and should  not be confused with the semicircular opening at the end of  the slot. The opening simply permits the free movement of  the wire all the way through the slot.  

Gauge numbers are useful in comparing the diameter of  wires, but not all types of wire or cable can be accurately  measured with a gauge. Large wires are usually stranded to  increase their flexibility. In such cases, the total area can be  determined by multiplying the area of one strand, usually  computed in circular mils (commonly used as a reference to  wire size) when diameter or gauge number is known by the  number of strands in the wire or cable.  

# Factors Affecting the Selection of Wire Size  

Several factors must be considered in selecting the size of  wire for transmitting and distributing electric power. One  factor is the allowable power loss (PR loss) in the line. This  loss represents electrical energy converted into heat. The  use of large conductors reduces the resistance and therefore  the PR loss. However, large conductors are more expensive  initially than small ones; they are heavier and require more  substantial supports.  

A second factor is the permissible voltage drop (IR drop)  in the line. If the source maintains a constant voltage at  

![](images/0e22372abe0aeff45637429262a19804a6f2e2e9c6c33d257e1dcf5e4a5f4a08.jpg)

Figure 4-82.   Wire gauge.  

the input to the line, any variation in the load on the line  causes a variation in line current and a consequent variation  in the IR drop in the line. A wide variation in the IR drop  in the line causes poor voltage regulation at the load. The  obvious remedy is to reduce either current or resistance. A  reduction in load current lowers the amount of power being  transmitted, whereas a reduction in line resistance increases  the size and weight of conductors required. A compromise is  generally reached whereby the voltage variation at the load  is within tolerable limits and the weight of line conductors  is not excessive.  

A third factor is the current carrying ability of the conductor.  When current is drawn through the conductor, heat is  generated. The temperature of the wire rises until the  heat radiated, or otherwise dissipated, is equal to the heat  generated by the passage of current through the line. If the  conductor is insulated, the heat generated in the conductor is  not so readily removed as it would be if the conductor were  not insulated. Thus, to protect the insulation from too much  heat, the current through the conductor must be maintained  below a certain value.  

When electrical conductors are installed in locations where  the ambient temperature is relatively high, the heat generated  by external sources constitutes an appreciable part of the total  conductor heating. Allowance must be made for the influence  of external heating on the allowable conductor current, and  each case has its own specific limitations. The maximum  allowable operating temperature of insulated conductors  varies with the type of conductor insulation being used.  

Tables are available that list the safe current ratings for  various sizes and types of conductors covered with various  types of insulation. The chart in  Figure 4-83  shows the current  carrying capacity and resistance of copper wire continuous  duty wire in bundles at various temperature ratings.  

# Factors Affecting Selection of Conductor Material  

Although silver is the best conductor, its cost limits its use to  special circuits where a substance with high conductivity is  needed. The two most generally used conductors are copper  and aluminum. Each has characteristics that make its use  advantageous under certain circumstances; also, each has  certain disadvantages.  

Copper has a higher conductivity; it is more ductile, can be  drawn out, has relatively high tensile strength, and can be easily  soldered. It is more expensive and heavier than aluminum.  

Although aluminum has only about 60 percent of the  conductivity of copper, it is used extensively. Its light weight  makes possible long spans, and its relatively large diameter  for a given conductivity reduces corona, the discharge of  electricity from the wire when it has a high potential. The  discharge is greater when smaller diameter wire is used than  when larger diameter wire is used. Some bus bars are made of  aluminum which has a greater radiating surface than copper  for the same conductance. The characteristics of copper and  aluminum are compared in  Figure 4-84 .  

# Voltage Drop in Aircraft Wire & Cable  

The voltage drop in the main power cables from the aircraft  generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed  2 percent of the regulated voltage when the generator is  carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at a  5-minute rate. The 5-minute rate in this case means that the  battery should last a minimum of 5 minutes in an emergency,  with all battery operated equipment running.  Figure 4-85 shows the recommended maximum voltage drop in the load  circuits between the bus and the utilization equipment.  

The resistance of the current return path through the aircraft  structure is always considered negligible. However, this is  based on the assumption that adequate bonding of the structure  or a special electric current return path has been provided  that is capable of carrying the required electric current with  a negligible voltage drop. A resistance measurement of 0.005  ohms from ground point of the generator or battery to ground  terminal of any electrical device is considered satisfactory.  

Another satisfactory method of determining circuit resistance  is to check the voltage drop across the circuit. If the voltage  drop does not exceed the limit established by the aircraft or  product manufacturer, the resistance value for the circuit is  considered satisfactory. When using the voltage drop method  of checking a circuit, the input voltage must be maintained  at a constant value.

The graph in  Figure   $_{\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{S}\mathcal{G}}$   applies to copper conductors  carrying direct current. To select the correct size of conductor,  two major requirements must be met. First, the size must  be sufficient to prevent an excessive voltage drop while  carrying the required current over the required distance.  Second, the size must be sufficient to prevent overheating  of the cable while carrying the required current. The graphs  in  Figures 4-86  and  4-87  can simplify these determinations.  To use this graph to select the proper size of conductor, the  following must be known:  

1.	 The conductor length in feet; 2.	 The number of amperes of current to be carried; 3.	 The amount of voltage drop permitted; 4.	 Whether the current to be carried is intermittent or continuous; 5.	 The estimated or measured temperature of the conductor; 6.	 Whether the wire to be installed is in a conduit or in a bundle; and 7.	 Whether it is a single conductor in free air.  

Suppose that you want to install a 50-foot conductor from  the aircraft bus to the equipment in a 28-volt system. For this  length, a 1-volt drop is permissible for continuous operation  with a conductor temperature of  $20\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   or less. By referring  to the chart in  Figure 4-86 , the maximum number of feet a  conductor may be run carrying a specified current with a  1-volt drop can be determined. In this example, the number 50 is selected.  

![](images/9b8e6bdb8f6d9d51750168024eca943c5a99ced6cdfce57b64fa6ac5e228fd42.jpg)  
Figure 4-86.   Conductor graph—continuous flow.  

Assuming the current required by the equipment is 20  amperes, the line indicating the value of 20 amperes should  be selected from the diagonal lines. Follow this diagonal  line downward until it intersects the horizontal line number  50. From this point, drop straight down to the bottom of the  graph to find that a conductor between size No. 8 and No.  10 is required to prevent a greater drop than 1 volt. Since the  indicated value is between two numbers, the larger size, No.  8, should be selected. This is the smallest size that should be  used to avoid an excessive voltage drop.  

If the installation is for equipment having only an intermittent  (maximum 2 minutes) requirement for power, the graph in  Figure 4-87  is used in the same manner.  

# Conductor Insulation  

Two fundamental properties of insulation materials (e.g.,  rubber, glass, asbestos, and plastic) are insulation resistance  and dielectric strength. These are entirely different and  distinct properties.  

Insulation resistance is the resistance to current leakage  through and over the surface of insulation materials.  Insulation resistance can be measured with a megger without  damaging the insulation. This serves as a useful guide in  determining the general condition of insulation. However, the  data obtained in this manner may not give a true picture of  the condition of the insulation. Clean, dry insulation having  cracks or other faults may show a high value of insulation  resistance but would not be suitable for use.  

Dielectric strength is the ability of the insulator to withstand  potential difference and is usually expressed in terms of  the voltage at which the insulation fails due to electrostatic  stress. Maximum dielectric strength values can be measured  by raising the voltage of a test sample until the insulation  breaks down.  

Because of the expense of insulation, its stiffening effect,  and the great variety of physical and electrical conditions  under which the conductors are operated, only the necessary  minimum insulation is applied for any particular type of cable  

![](images/6123455aea4a98a396a23f032d473fc89563a1a7cdcc562d0efa0cc4c375f242.jpg)  
Figure 4-87.   Conductor graph—intermittent flow.  

designed to do a specific job.  

The type of conductor insulation material varies with the type  of installation. Rubber, silk, and paper insulation are no longer  used extensively in aircraft systems. More common today are  such materials as vinyl, cotton, nylon, Teflon, and Rockbestos.  

# Identifying Wire & Cable  

To aid in testing and repair operations, many maintenance  activities mark wire or cable with a combination of letters  and numbers that identify the wire, the circuit it belongs to,  the gauge number, and other information necessary to relate  the wire or cable to a wiring diagram. Such markings are the  identification code.  

There is no standard procedure for marking and identifying  wiring; each manufacturer normally develops its own  identification code.  Figure 4-88  illustrates one identification  system and shows the usual spacing in marking a wire.  Some system components, especially plugs and jacks, are  identified by a letter or group of letters and numbers added  to the basic identification number. These letters and numbers  may indicate the location of the component in the system.  Interconnected cables are also marked in some systems to  indicate location, proper termination, and use. In any system,  the marking should be legible, and the stamping color should  contrast with the color of the wire insulation. For example,  use black stamping with light-colored backgrounds, or white  stamping on dark-colored backgrounds.  

Most manufacturers mark the wires at intervals of not more  than 15 inches lengthwise and within 3 inches of each  junction or terminating point.  [Figure 4-89]  

Coaxial cable and wires at terminal blocks and junction  boxes are often identified by marking or stamping a wiring  sleeve rather than the wire itself. For general purpose wiring,  flexible vinyl sleeving, either clear or white opaque, is  

![](images/7a847258c54dcd5897e4536f1bdedd9568117cda219621a4cd583d4884e74cd3.jpg)

Figure 4-89.   Wire identification at a terminal block.  

commonly used. For high-temperature applications, silicone  rubber or silicone fiberglass sleeving is recommended.  Where resistance to synthetic hydraulic fluids or other  solvents is necessary, either clear or white opaque nylon  sleeving can be used.  

While the preferred method is to stamp the identification  marking directly on the wire or on sleeving, other methods  are often employed. One method uses a marked sleeve tied in  place. The other uses a pressure-sensitive tape.  [Figure 4-90]  

# Electrical Wiring Installation  

The following recommended procedures for installing aircraft  electrical wiring are typical of those used on most types  of aircraft. For purposes of this discussion, the following  definitions are applicable:  

1.	 Open wiring—any wire, wire group, or wire bundle  not enclosed in conduit. 2.	 Wire group—two or more wires in the same location,  tied together to identity the group. 3.	 Wire bundle—two or more wire groups tied together  because they are going in the same direction at the  point where the tie is located. The bundle facilitates  maintenance. 4.	 Electrically protected wiring—wires that include in  the circuit protections against overloading, such as  fuses, circuit breakers, or other limiting devices. 5.	 Electrically unprotected wiring—wires, generally  from generators to main bus distribution points, that  

![](images/6184ef5bc15dfc9a30a8fedf0a661ba7da087e293db76b2bd3c25118b52a4dd0.jpg)  
Figure 4-90.   Alternate methods of identifying wire bundles.  

do not have protection, such as fuses, circuit breakers,  or other current-limiting devices.  

# Wire Groups & Bundles  

Grouping or bundling certain wires, such as electrically  unprotected power wiring and wiring to duplicate vital  equipment, should be avoided. Wire bundles should generally  be limited in size to a bundle of 75 wires, or 2 inches in  diameter where practicable. When several wires are grouped  at junction boxes, terminal blocks, panels, etc., the identity  of the group within a bundle can be retained.  [Figure 4-91]  

# Twisting Wires  

When specified on the engineering drawing, parallel wires  must be twisted. The most common examples are:  

1.	 Wiring in the vicinity of magnetic compass or flux  valve, 2.	 Three-phase distribution wiring, and 3.	 Certain other wires (usually radio wiring).  

Twist the wires so that they lie snugly against each other,  making approximately the number of twists per foot as listed  in  Figure 4-92.  Always check wire insulation for damage after  twisting. If the insulation is torn or frayed, replace the wire.  

# Spliced Connections in Wire Bundles  

Spliced connections in wire groups or bundles should be  located so that they can be easily inspected. Splices should  also be staggered so that the bundle does not become  excessively enlarged.  [Figure 4-93]  All noninsulated splices  should be covered with plastic, securely tied at both ends.  

# Slack in Wiring Bundles  

Single wires or wire bundles should not be installed with  excessive slack. Slack between supports should normally not  exceed   $\%$   inch. This is the maximum it should be possible  

![](images/04f86b300969e07709eb26d98c92d55a22664a9e102ebc276b3623b5a243d36d.jpg)  
Figure 4-91.   Group and bundle ties.  

![](images/74897a4dc5d1db91547179ea6afcd4af67a73ceeb74319acf7135f8a44f2cfc6.jpg)  

to deflect the wire with normal hand force. However, this  may be exceeded if the wire bundle is thin and the clamps  are far apart. But the slack should never be so great that  the wire bundle can abrade against any surface it touches.  [Figure 4-94]  A sufficient amount of slack should be allowed  near each end of a bundle to:  

1.	 Permit easy maintenance; 2.	 Allow replacement of terminals; 3.	 Relieve mechanical strain on the wires, wire junctions,  or supports; 4.	 Permit free movement of shock and vibration-mounted  equipment; and 5.	 Permit shifting of equipment for purposes of  maintenance.  

# Bend Radii  

Bends in wire groups or bundles should not be less than  ten times the outside diameter of the wire group or bundle.  However, at terminal strips, where wire is suitably supported  at each end of the bend, a minimum radius of three times  the outside diameter of the wire, or wire bundle, is usually  acceptable. There are exceptions to these guidelines in the  case of certain types of cable; for example, coaxial cable  should never be bent to a smaller radius than six times the  outside diameter.  

# Routing & Installation  

All wiring should be installed so that it is mechanically  and electrically sound and neat in appearance. Whenever  practicable, wires and bundles should be routed parallel with,  or at right angles to, the stringers or ribs of the area involved.  An exception to this general rule is the coaxial cables, which  are routed as directly as possible.  

The wiring must be adequately supported throughout its  length. A sufficient number of supports must be provided  to prevent undue vibration of the unsupported lengths. All  wires and wire groups should be routed and installed to  protect them from:  

1.	 Chafing or abrasion; 2.	 High temperature; 3.	 Being used as handholds, or as support for personal  belongings and equipment; 4.	 Damage by personnel moving within the aircraft; 5.	 Damage from cargo stowage or shifting; 6.	 Damage from battery acid fumes, spray, or spillage;  

![](images/d5e61b441bd48fb0040660f1d3668125595239b99e140cac15460c4116040c26.jpg)

Figure 4-94.   Slack in wire bundle between supports.  

and 7.	 Damage from solvents and fluids.  

# Protection Against Chafing  

Wires and wire groups should be installed so that they are  protected against chafing or abrasion in those locations where  contact with sharp surfaces or other wires would damage the  insulation. Damage to the insulation can cause short circuits,  malfunctions, or inadvertent operation of equipment. Cable  clamps should be used to support wire bundles at each hole  through a bulkhead.  [Figure 4-95]  If wires come closer than   $\%$   inch to the edge of the hole, a suitable grommet is used in  the hole.  [Figure 4-96]  

Sometimes, it is necessary to cut nylon or rubber grommets  to facilitate installation. In these instances, after insertion,  the grommet can be secured in place with general purpose  cement. The slot should be at the top of the hole, and the  cut should be made at an angle of  $45^{\circ}$   to the axis of the wire  bundle hole.  

# Protection Against High Temperature  

To prevent insulation deterioration, wires should be kept  separate from high-temperature equipment, such as resistors,  exhaust stacks, heating ducts. The amount of separation is  usually specified by engineering drawings. Some wires must  be run through hot areas. These wires must be insulated with  high-temperature rated material, such as asbestos, fiberglass,  or Teflon. Additional protection is also often required in the  form of conduits. A low-temperature insulated wire should  never be used to replace a high-temperature insulated wire.  

![](images/63ef51a0a3ad33bc15fadc67d81e940609f99f410c5fbeec7f43a5a9c184c530.jpg)

Figure 4-96.   Cable clamp and grommet at bulkhead hole.  

Many coaxial cables have soft plastic insulation, such as  polyethylene, that is especially subject to deformation and  deterioration at elevated temperatures. All high-temperature  areas should be avoided when installing these cables.  

Additional abrasion protection should be given to asbestos  wires enclosed in conduit. Either conduit with a high  temperature rubber liner should be used or asbestos wires  can be enclosed individually in high-temperature plastic  tubes before being installed in the conduit.  

# Protection Against Solvents & Fluids  

Avoid installing wires in areas where they are subjected to  damage from fluids. Wires should not be placed in the lowest  four inches of the aircraft fuselage, except those that must  terminate in that area. If there is a possibility that wiring  without a protective nylon outer jacket may be soaked with  fluids, plastic tubing should be used to protect it. This tubing  should extend past the exposure area in both directions  and should be tied at each end. If the wire has a low point  between the tubing ends, provide a   $\%$  -inch drainage hole.  [Figure 4-97]  This hole should be punched into the tubing  after the installation is complete and the low point definitely  established by using a hole punch to cut a half circle. Care  should be taken not to damage any wires inside the tubing  when using the punch.  

Wire should never be routed below a battery. All wires in the  vicinity of a battery should be inspected frequently. Wires  discolored by battery fumes should be replaced.  

![](images/fd83fe35004057469d96be453d007e2fd2fb9bfaac7cb0fe1d0ecc584292f285.jpg)  
Figure 4-97.   Drainage hole in low point of tubing.  

# Protection of Wires in Wheel Well Area  

Wires located in wheel wells are subject to many additional  hazards, such as exposure to fluids, pinching, and severe  flexing in service. All wire bundles should be protected by  sleeves of flexible tubing securely held at each end. There  should be no relative movement at points where flexible  tubing is secured. These wires and the insulating tubing  should be inspected carefully at very frequent intervals, and  wires or tubing should be replaced at the first sign of wear.  There should be no strain on attachments when parts are fully  extended, but slack should not be excessive.  

# Routing Precautions  

When wiring must be routed parallel to combustible fluid  or oxygen lines for short distances, as much separation as  possible should be maintained. The wires should be on a level  with, or above, the plumbing lines. Clamps should be spaced  so that if a wire is broken at a clamp, it will not contact the  line. Where a 6-inch separation is not possible, both the wire  bundle and the plumbing line can be clamped to the same  structure to prevent any relative motion. If the separation is  less than 2 inches but more than  $\%$     inch, two cable clamps  back to back can be used to maintain a rigid separation only  and not for support of the bundle.  [Figure 4-98]  No wire  should be routed so that it is located nearer than  $\%$   inch to a  plumbing line, nor should a wire or wire bundle be supported  from a plumbing line that carries flammable fluids or oxygen. Wiring should be routed to maintain a minimum clearance  of at least 3 inches from control cables. If this cannot be  accomplished, mechanical guards should be installed to  prevent contact between wiring and control cables.

Figure 4-98.   Separation of wires from plumbing lines.  

# Installation of Cable Clamps  

Cable clamps should be installed with regard to the proper  mounting angle.  [Figure 4-99]  The mounting screw should  be above the wire bundle. It is also desirable that the back  of the cable clamp rest against a structural member where  practicable.  Figure 4-100  shows some typical mounting  hardware used in installing cable clamps. Be sure that wires  are not pinched in cable clamps. Where possible, mount them  directly to structural members.  [Figure 4-101]  

Clamps can be used with rubber cushions to secure wire  bundles to tubular structures.  [Figure 4-102]  Such clamps  must fit tightly but should not be deformed when locked in  place.

# Lacing & Tying Wire Bundles  

Wire groups and bundles are laced or tied with cord to provide  ease of installation, maintenance, and inspection. This  section describes and illustrates recommended procedures for  lacing and tying wires with knots that hold tightly under all  conditions. For the purposes of this discussion, the following  terms are defined:  

1.	 Tying is the securing together of a group or bundle  of wires by individual pieces of cord tied around the  group or bundle at regular intervals. 2.	 Lacing is the securing together of a group or bundle  of wires by a continuous piece of cord forming loops  at regular intervals around the group or bundle.  

![](images/ce5cc117a3e0fc98181db6d8a5d35e0326e46e33d284acfeb4b08b669499e103.jpg)  
Figure 4-101.   Mounting cable clamps to structure.  

The material used for lacing and tying is either cotton or  nylon cord. Nylon cord is moisture- and fungus-resistant,  but cotton cord must be waxed before using to give it these  necessary protective characteristics.  

# Single-Cord Lacing  

Figure 4-103  shows the steps in lacing a wire bundle with a  single cord. The lacing procedure is started at the thick end  of the wire group or bundle with a knot consisting of a clove  hitch with an extra loop. The lacing is then continued at regular  intervals with half hitches along the wire group or bundle and  at each point where a wire or wire group branches off. The half  hitches should be spaced so that the bundle is neat and secure.  

![](images/540db8356f02f3a3b6cdce6504c56e2d0d852ee676543d4b99b161ab19f47596.jpg)  
Figure 4-102.   Installing cable clamps to tubular structure.  

The lacing is ended by tying a knot consisting of a clove hitch  with an extra loop. After the knot is tied, the free ends of the  lacing cord should be trimmed to approximately  $\%$    inch.  

# Double-Cord Lacing  

Figure 4-104  illustrates the procedure for double-cord lacing.  The lacing is started at the thick end of the wire group or  bundle with a bowline-on-a-bight knot.  [Figure 4-104A]  At  regular intervals along the wire group or bundle, and at each  point where a wire branches off, the lacing is continued using  half hitches, with both cords held firmly together. The half  hitches should be spaced so that the group or bundle is neat  and secure. The lacing is ended with a knot consisting of a  half hitch, continuing one of the cords clockwise and the other  counterclockwise and then tying the cord ends with a square  knot. The free ends of the lacing cord should be trimmed to  approximately  $\%$    inch.  

# Lacing Branch-Offs  

Figure 4-105  illustrates a recommended procedure for lacing  a wire group that branches off the main wire bundle. The  branch-off lacing is started with a knot located on the main  bundle just past the branch-off point. Continue the lacing  along the branched-off wire group using regularly spaced  half hitches. If a double cord is used, both cords should be  held snugly together. The half hitches should be spaced to  lace the bundle neatly and securely. End the lacing with the  regular terminal knot used in single- or double-cord lacing,  as applicable, and trim the free ends of the lacing cord neatly.  

# Tying  

All wire groups or bundles should be tied where supports  are more than 12 inches apart. Ties are made using  waxed cotton cord, nylon cord, or fiberglass cord. Some  manufacturers permit the use of pressure-sensitive vinyl  electrical tape. When permitted, the tape should be wrapped  three turns around the bundle and the ends heat sealed to  prevent unwinding of the tape.  Figure 4-106  illustrates a  recommended procedure for tying a wire group or bundle.  The tie is started by wrapping the cord around the wire group  to tie a clove-hitch knot. Then, a square knot with an extra  loop is tied and the free ends of the cord trimmed.  

Temporary ties are sometimes used in making up and  installing wire groups and bundles. Colored cord is normally  used to make temporary ties, since they are removed when  the installation is complete.  

Whether lacing or tying, bundles should be secured tightly  enough to prevent slipping, but not so tightly that the cord  cuts into or deforms the insulation. This applies especially to  coaxial cable, which has a soft dielectric insulation between  the inner and outer conductor. Coaxial cables have been  damaged by the use of lacing materials or by methods of  lacing or tying wire bundles that cause a concentrated force  on the cable insulation. Elastic lacing materials, small- diameter lacing cord, and excessive tightening deform the  interconductor insulation and result in short circuits or  impedance changes. Flat nylon braided waxed lacing tape

should be used for lacing or tying any wire bundles containing  coaxial cables.  

The part of a wire group or bundle located inside a conduit  is not tied or laced; however, wire groups or bundles inside  enclosures, such as junction boxes, should be laced only.  

# Cutting Wire & Cable  

To make installation, maintenance, and repair easier, runs of  wire and cable in aircraft are broken at specified locations  by junctions, such as connectors, terminal blocks, or buses.  

![](images/d312b29d0365e41fd660fb7ffeb4e965020978bc3a0de38d78b7dd32d41b04ba.jpg)  
Figure 4-106.   Tying a wire group of bundle.  

Before assembly to these junctions, wires and cables must  be cut to length.  

All wires and cables should be cut to the lengths specified on  drawings and wiring diagrams. The cut should be made clean  and square, and the wire or cable should not be deformed.  If necessary, large diameter wire should be reshaped after  cutting. Good cuts can be made only if the blades of cutting  tools are sharp and free from nicks. A dull blade deforms and  extrudes wire ends.  

# Stripping Wire & Cable  

Nearly all wire and cable used as electrical conductors are  covered with some type of insulation. In order to make  electrical connections with the wire, a part of this insulation  must be removed to expose the bare conductor. Copper wire  can be stripped in a number of ways depending on the size and  insulation.  Figure 4-107  lists some types of stripping tools  recommended for various wire sizes and types of insulation. Aluminum wire must be stripped using extreme care, since  individual strands break very easily after being nicked.  

The following general precautions are recommended when  stripping any type of wire:  

1.	 When using any type of wire stripper, hold the wire  so that it is perpendicular to the cutting blades. 2.	 Adjust automatic stripping tools carefully; follow the  manufacturer’s instructions to avoid nicking, cutting,  or otherwise damaging strands. This is especially  important for aluminum wires and for copper wires  smaller than No. 10. Examine stripped wires for  damage. Cut off and restrip, if length is sufficient,  or reject and replace any wires with more than the  allowable number of nicked or broken strands listed  in the manufacturer’s instructions. 3.	 Make sure insulation is clean cut with no frayed or  ragged edges. Trim, if necessary. 4.	 Make sure all insulation is removed from stripped area.  Some types of wires are supplied with a transparent  layer of insulation between the conductor and the  primary insulation. If this is present, remove it. 5.	 When using hand wire strippers to remove lengths of  

![Figure 4-107.   Wire strippers for copper wire. ](images/0f2f1d3eea75e9ca2482370ec50e7b72c1bea91a254c154846c2e463e1a1bd2a.jpg)  

insulation longer than  $\%$   inch, it is easier to accomplish  in two or more operations. 6.	 Retwist copper strands by hand or with pliers, if  necessary, to restore natural lay and tightness of strands.  

A pair of hand wire strippers is shown in  Figure 4-108 .  This tool is commonly used to strip most types of wire. The  following general procedures describe the steps for stripping  wire with a hand stripper.  [Figure 4-109]  

1.	 Insert wire into exact center of correct cutting slot  for wire size to be stripped. Each slot is marked with  wire size. 2.	 Close handles together as far as they will go. 3.	 Release handles allowing wire holder to return to the  open position. 4.	 Remove stripped wire.  

# Solderless Terminals & Splices  

Splicing of electrical cable should be kept to a minimum and  avoided entirely in locations subject to extreme vibrations.  Individual wires in a group or bundle can usually be spliced  if the completed splice is located where it can be inspected  periodically. The splices should be staggered so that the  bundle does not become excessively enlarged. Many types of  aircraft splice connectors are available for splicing individual  wires. Self-insulated splice connectors are usually preferred;  however, a noninsulated splice connector can be used if the  splice is covered with plastic sleeving secured at both ends.  Solder splices may be used, but they are particularly brittle  and not recommended.  

Electric wires are terminated with solderless terminal lugs  to permit easy and efficient connection to and disconnection  from terminal blocks, bus bars, or other electrical equipment.  Solderless splices join electric wires to form permanent  continuous runs. Solderless terminal lugs and splices  are made of copper or aluminum and are preinsulated or  uninsulated, depending on the desired application.

Figure 4-109.   Stripping wire with hand strippers.  

Terminal lugs are generally available in three types for use  in different space conditions. These are the flag, straight,  and right-angle lugs. Terminal lugs are crimped, sometimes  called staked or swaged, to the wires by means of hand or  power crimping tools.  

# Copper Wire Terminals  

Copper wires are terminated with solderless, preinsulated  straight copper terminal lugs. The insulation is part of the  terminal lug and extends beyond its barrel so that it covers a  portion of the wire insulation, making the use of an insulation  sleeve unnecessary.  [Figure 4-110]  

In addition, preinsulated terminal lugs contain an insulation  grip (a metal reinforcing sleeve) beneath the insulation for  extra gripping strength on the wire insulation. Preinsulated  terminals accommodate more than one size of wire; the  insulation is usually color coded to identify the wire sizes  that can be terminated with each of the terminal lug sizes.  

# Crimping Tools  

Hand, portable power, and stationary power tools are  available for crimping terminal lugs. These tools crimp the  barrel of the terminal lug to the conductor and simultaneously  crimp the insulation grip to the wire insulation.  

Hand crimping tools all have a self-locking ratchet that  prevents opening the tool until the crimp is complete. Some  hand crimping tools are equipped with a nest of various size  inserts to fit different size terminal lugs. Others are used on  one terminal lug size only. All types of hand crimping tools  are checked by gauges for proper adjustment of crimping jaws.  

Figure 4-111  shows a terminal lug inserted into a hand tool.  The following general guidelines outline the crimping  procedure:  

1.	 Strip the wire insulation to proper length. 2.	 Insert the terminal lug, tongue first, into the hand tool  barrel crimping jaws until the terminal lug barrel butts  flush against the tool stop. 3.	 Insert the stripped wire into the terminal lug barrel  until the wire insulation butts flush against the end of  the barrel.

Figure 4-111.   Inserting terminal lug into hand tool.  

4.	 Squeeze the tool handles until the ratchet releases. 5.	 Remove the completed assembly and examine it for  proper crimp.  

Some types of uninsulated terminal lugs are insulated after  assembly to a wire by means of pieces of transparent flexible  tubing called sleeves. The sleeve provides electrical and  mechanical protection at the connection. When the size of  the sleeves used is such that it fits tightly over the terminal  lug, the sleeves need not be tied; otherwise, it should be tied  with lacing cord  [Figure 4-112]  

# Aluminum Wire Terminals  

Aluminum wire is being used increasingly in aircraft  systems because of its weight advantage over copper.  However, bending aluminum causes “work hardening”  of the metal, making it brittle. This results in failure or  breakage of strands much sooner than in a similar case with  copper wire. Aluminum also forms a high-resistant oxide  

![](images/8aeba2347adf3b31dff9bcdbcc650535a8fc8071cd050ecf87b43924e6afbcfc.jpg)  
Figure 4-112.   Insulating sleeves.  

film immediately upon exposure to air. To compensate for  these disadvantages, it is important to use the most reliable  installation procedures. Only aluminum terminal lugs are  used to terminate aluminum wires.  

All aluminum terminals incorporate an inspection hole that  permits checking the depth of wire insertion.  [Figure 4-113] The barrel of aluminum terminal lugs is filled with a  petrolatum-zinc dust compound. This compound removes the  oxide film from the aluminum by a grinding process during  the crimping operation. The compound also minimizes later  oxidation of the completed connection by excluding moisture  and air. The compound is retained inside the terminal lug  barrel by a plastic or foil seal at the end of the barrel.  

# Splicing Copper Wires Using Preinsulated Wires  

Preinsulated permanent copper splices join small wires of  sizes 22 through 10. Each splice size can be used for more  than one wire size. Splices are usually color coded in the  same manner as preinsulated, small copper terminal lugs.  Some splices are insulated with white plastic. Splices are  also used to reduce wire sizes  [Figure 4-114]  

Crimping tools are used to accomplish this type of splice. The  crimping procedures are the same as those used for terminal  lugs, except that the crimping operation must be done twice,  one for each end of the splice.  

# Emergency Splicing Repairs  

Broken wires can be repaired by means of crimped splices,  by using terminal lugs from which the tongue has been cut  off, or by soldering together and potting broken strands.  These repairs are applicable to copper wire. Damaged  aluminum wire must not be temporarily spliced. These  repairs are for temporary emergency use only and should  be replaced as soon as possible with permanent repairs.  Since some manufacturers prohibit splicing, the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions should always be consulted.  

# Splicing with Solder & Potting Compound  

When neither a permanent splice nor a terminal lug  is available, a broken wire can be repaired as follows  [Figure 4-115] :  

1.	 Install a piece of plastic sleeving about 3 inches long  and of the proper diameter to fit loosely over the  insulation on one piece of the broken wire. 2.	 Strip approximately  $1\%$   inches from each broken end  of the wire. 3.	 Lay the stripped ends side by side and twist one wire  around the other with approximately four turns. 4.	 Twist the free end of the second wire around the first  

![](images/fec62e9d0080b19b1ed7a93c292b048989cf74aae933b19c7175731c55246dcb.jpg)

wire with approximately four turns. Solder the wire  turns together using  ${\bf\%}$   tin-lead resin-core solder.

 5.	 When solder is cool, draw the sleeve over the soldered  wires and tie at one end. If potting compound is  available, fill the sleeve with potting material and  tie securely.

 6.	 Allow the potting compound to set without touching  for 4 hours. Full cure and electrical characteristics are  achieved in 24 hours.  

# Connecting Terminal Lugs to Terminal Blocks  

Terminal lugs should be installed on terminal blocks in such a  manner that they are locked against movement in the direction  of loosening.  [Figure 4-116]  

Terminal blocks are normally supplied with studs secured  in place by a plain washer, an external tooth lockwasher,  and a nut. In connecting terminals, a recommended practice  is to place copper terminal jugs directly on top of the nut,  followed with a plain washer and elastic stop nut, or with a  plain washer, split steel lockwasher, and plain nut.  

Aluminum terminal lugs should be placed over a plated  brass plain washer, followed with another plated brass plain  washer, split steel lockwasher, and plain nut or elastic stop  nut. The plated brass washer should have a diameter equal to  the tongue width of the aluminum terminal lug. Consult the  manufacturer’s instructions for recommended dimensions of  these plated brass washers. Do not place any washer in the  current path between two aluminum terminal lugs or between  two copper terminal lugs. Also, do not place a lockwasher  directly against the tongue or pad of the aluminum terminal.  To join a copper terminal lug to an aluminum terminal lug,  place a plated brass plain washer over the nut that holds the  stud in place; follow with the aluminum terminal lug, a plated  

![](images/bf37902b43d7bb9e319283e05d77a464d2a5896bac02869f9a68901ad8c5d693.jpg)

brass plain washer, the copper terminal lug, plain washer, split  steel lockwasher and plain nut or self-locking, all metal nut.  As a general rule, use a torque wrench to tighten nuts to ensure  sufficient contact pressure. Manufacturer’s instructions  provide installation torques for all types of terminals.  

# Bonding & Grounding  

Bonding is the electrical connecting of two or more  conducting objects not otherwise connected adequately.  Grounding is the electrical connecting of a conducting  object to the primary structure for return of current. Primary  structure is the main frame, fuselage, or wing structure of  the aircraft. Bonding and grounding connections are made  in aircraft electrical systems to:  

1.	 Protect aircraft and personnel against hazards from  lightning discharge, 2.	 Provide current return paths,  

3.	 Prevent development of radio-frequency potentials, 4.	 Protect personnel from shock hazard, 5.	 Provide stability of radio transmission and reception,  and 6.	 Prevent accumulation of static charge.  

# General Bonding & Grounding Procedures  

The following general procedures and precautions are  recommended when making bonding or grounding connections.  

1.	 Bond or ground parts to the primary aircraft structure,  where practicable. 2.	 Make bonding or grounding connections in such  a manner that no part of the aircraft structure is  weakened. 3.	 Bond parts individually, if possible. 4.	 Install bonding or grounding connections against  smooth, clean surfaces. 5.	 Install bonding or grounding connections so that  vibration, expansion or contraction, or relative  movement in normal service does not break or loosen  the connection. 6.	 Install bonding and grounding connections in  protected areas whenever possible.  

Bonding jumpers should be kept as short as practicable, and  installed so that the resistance of each connection does not  exceed 0.003 ohm. The jumper should not interfere with  the operation of movable aircraft elements, such as surface  controls; normal movement of these elements should not  result in damage to the bonding jumper.  

To be sure a low resistance connection has been made,  nonconducting finishes, such as paint and anodizing films,  should be removed from the surface to be contacted by the  bonding terminal.  

Electrolytic action can rapidly corrode a bonding connection  if suitable precautions are not observed. Aluminum alloy  jumpers are recommended for most cases; however,  copper jumpers can be used to bond together parts made  of stainless steel, cadmium-plated steel, copper, brass, or  bronze. Where contact between dissimilar metals cannot  be avoided, the choice of jumper and hardware should be  such that corrosion is minimized, and the part most likely to  corrode is the jumper or associated hardware. Parts A and B  of  Figure 4-117  illustrate some proper hardware combinations  for making bonding connections. At locations where finishes  are removed, a protective finish should be applied to the  completed connection to prevent corrosion.  

![](images/fe361268bd688510f68bae4cc8d10998a3a409b174b3e4dc307687809b0758f0.jpg)  

The use of solder to attach bonding jumpers should be avoided.  Tubular members should be bonded by means of clamps to  which the jumper is attached. The proper choice of clamp  material minimizes the probability of corrosion. When bonding  jumpers carry a substantial amount of ground return current, the  current rating of the jumper should be adequate, and it should  be determined that a negligible voltage drop is produced.  

Bonding and grounding connections are normally made to  flat surfaces by means of through-bolts or screws where there  is easy access for installation. The general types of bolted  connections are:  

1.	 In making a stud connection, a bolt or screw is  locked securely to the structure becoming a stud.  [Figure 4-118]  Grounding or bonding jumpers can  be removed or added to the shank of the stud without  removing the stud from the structure. 2.	 Nutplates are used where access to the nut for repairs  is difficult. Nutplates are riveted or welded to a clean  area of the structure.  [Figure 4-119]  

Bonding and grounding connections are also made to a tab  riveted to a structure.  [Figure 4-120]  In such cases, it is  important to clean the bonding or grounding surface and  make the connection as though the connection were being  made to the structure. If it is necessary to remove the tab for  any reason, the rivets should be replaced with rivets one size  larger, and the mating surfaces of the structure and the tab  should be clean and free of anodic film.  

Bonding or grounding connections can be made to aluminum  alloy, magnesium, or corrosion-resistant steel tubular

structure.  Figure 4-121  shows the arrangement of hardware  for bonding with an aluminum jumper. Because of the ease  with which aluminum is deformed, it is necessary to distribute  screw and nut pressure by means of plain washers.  

Hardware used to make bonding or grounding connections  should be selected on the basis of mechanical strength,  current to be carried, and ease of installation. If connection  is made by aluminum or copper jumpers to the structure of  a dissimilar material, a washer of suitable material should be  installed between the dissimilar metals so that any corrosion  occurs on the washer.  

of the material of the structure to which attachment is made  and on the material of the jumper and terminal specified for  the bonding or grounding connection. Either a screw or bolt  of the proper size for the specified jumper terminal should  be used. When repairing or replacing existing bonding or  grounding connections, the same type of hardware used in  the original connection should always be used.  

# Connectors  

Connectors (plugs and receptacles) facilitate maintenance  when frequent disconnection is required. Since the cable  is soldered to the connector inserts, the joints should be  individually installed and the cable bundle firmly supported to  avoid damage by vibration. Connectors have been particularly  vulnerable to corrosion in the past, due to condensation within  the shell. Special connectors with waterproof features have  been developed that may replace nonwaterproof plugs in  areas where moisture causes a problem. A connector of the  same basic type and design should be used when replacing  a connector. Connectors that are susceptible to corrosion  difficulties may be treated with a chemically inert waterproof  jelly. When replacing connector assemblies, the socket-type  insert should be used on the half that is “ live” or “hot” after the  connector is disconnected to prevent unintentional grounding.  

# Types of Connectors  

Connectors are identified by Air Force-Navy (AN) numbers  and are divided into classes with the manufacturer’s  variations in each class. The manufacturer’s variations are  differences in appearance and in the method of meeting a  specification. Some commonly used connectors are shown in  Figure 4-122 . There are five basic classes of AN connectors  used in most aircraft. Each class of connector has slightly  different construction characteristics. Classes A, B, C, and D  are made of aluminum, and class K is made of steel.  

1.	 Class A—solid, one-piece back shell general-purpose  connector.  

![](images/0b5b7ad3b182d4dca0c5476524cb79359d33a4cef10eb41c87c3e7de6bd9eb9b.jpg)

Figure 4-122.   AN connectors.  

2.	 Class B—connector back shell separates into two parts  lengthwise. Used primarily where it is important that  the soldered connectors are readily accessible. The  back shell is held together by a threaded ring or by  screws.  

3.	 Class C—a pressurized connector with inserts that  are not removable. Similar to a class A connector  in appearance, but the inside sealing arrangement is  sometimes different. It is used on walls or bulkheads  of pressurized equipment.  

4.	 Class D—moisture and vibration resistant connector  that has a sealing grommet in the back shell. Wires are  threaded through tight fitting holes in the grommet,  sealing against moisture.  

5.	 Class K—a fireproof connector used in areas where it  is vital that the electric current is not interrupted, even  though the connector may be exposed to continuous  open flame. Wires are crimped to the pin or socket  contacts and the shells are made of steel. This class of  connector is normally longer than other connectors.  

# Connector Identification  

Code letters and numbers are marked on the coupling ring  or shell to identify a connector. This code provides all the  information necessary to obtain the correct replacement for  a defective or damaged part.  [Figure 4-123]  

Many special-purpose connectors have been designed for  use in aircraft applications. These include subminiature and  rectangular shell connectors, and connectors with short body  shells, or of split-shell construction.  

# Installation of Connectors  

The following procedures outline one recommended method  of assembling connectors to receptacles:  

1.	 Locate the proper position of the plug in relation to  the receptacle by aligning the key of one part with the  groove or keyway of the other part. 2.	 Start the plug into the receptacle with a slight forward  pressure and engage the threads of the coupling ring  and receptacle. 3.	 Alternately push in the plug and tighten the coupling  ring until the plug is completely seated. 4.	 Use connector pliers to tighten coupling rings one- sixteenth to one-eighth turn beyond finger tight if  space around the connector is too small to obtain a  good finger grip. 5.	 Never use force to mate connectors to receptacles.  

Do not hammer a plug into its receptacle and never use a  torque wrench or pliers to lock coupling rings.  

A connector is generally disassembled from a receptacle in  the following manner:  

1.	 Use connector pliers to loosen coupling rings that are  too tight to be loosened by hand. 2.	 Alternately pull on the plug body and unscrew the  coupling ring until the connector is separated. 3.	 Protect disconnected plugs and receptacles with  caps or plastic bags to keep debris from entering and  causing faults. 4.	 Do not use excessive force and do not pull on attached  wires.

Figure 4-123.   AN connector markings.  

# Conduit  

Conduit is used in aircraft installations for the mechanical  protection of wires and cables. It is available in metallic and  nonmetallic materials and in both rigid and flexible form.  

When selecting conduit size for a specific cable bundle  application, it is common practice to allow for ease in  maintenance and possible future circuit expansion by  specifying the conduit inner diameter about 25 percent larger  than the maximum diameter of the conductor bundle. The  nominal diameter of a rigid metallic conduit is the outside  diameter. Therefore, to obtain the inside diameter, subtract  twice the tube wall thickness.  

From the abrasion standpoint, the conductor is vulnerable  at the ends of the conduit. Suitable fittings are affixed to  conduit ends in such a manner that a smooth surface comes in  contact with the conductor within the conduit. When fittings  are not used, the conduit end should be flared to prevent wire  insulation damage. The conduit is supported by clamps along  the conduit run.  

Many of the common conduit installation problems can be  avoided by proper attention to the following details:  

1.	 Do not locate conduit where it can be used as a  handhold or footstep. 2.	 Provide drain holes at the lowest point in a conduit  run. Drilling burrs should be carefully removed from  the drain holes. 3.	 Support the conduit to prevent chafing against the  structure and to avoid stressing its end fittings.  

Damaged conduit sections should be repaired to prevent  injury to the wires or wire bundle. The minimum acceptable  tube bend radii for rigid conduit as prescribed by the  manufacturer’s instructions should be carefully followed.  Kinked or wrinkled bends in a rigid conduit are normally  not considered acceptable.  

Flexible aluminum conduit is widely available in two types:  bare flexible and rubber-covered conduit. Flexible brass  conduit is normally used instead of flexible aluminum where  it is necessary to minimize radio interference. Flexible  conduit may be used where it is impractical to use rigid  conduit, such as areas that have motion between conduit ends  or where complex bends are necessary. Transparent adhesive  tape is recommended when cutting flexible conduit with a  hacksaw to minimize fraying of the braid.  

# Electrical Equipment Installation  

This section provides general procedures and safety  precautions for installation of commonly used aircraft  electrical equipment and components. Electrical load limits,  acceptable means of controlling or monitoring electrical  loads, and circuit protection devices are subjects with which  mechanics must be familiar to properly install and maintain  aircraft electrical systems.  

# Electrical Load Limits  

When installing additional electrical equipment that  consumes electrical power in an aircraft, the total electrical  load must be safely controlled or managed within the rated  limits of the affected components of the aircraft’s power- supply system. Regulation of the field current strength is  used to control DC generator voltage.  

Before any aircraft electrical load is increased, the associated  wires, cables, and circuit-protection devices, such as fuses  or circuit breakers, should be checked to determine that the  new electrical load—previous maximum load plus added  load—does not exceed the rated limits of the existing wires,  cables, or protection devices.  

The generator or alternator output ratings prescribed by the  manufacturer should be compared with the electrical loads  that can be imposed on the affected generator or alternator  by installed equipment. When the comparison shows that the  probable total connected electrical load can exceed the output  load limits of the generator(s) or alternator(s), the load should  be reduced so that an overload cannot occur. When a storage  battery is part of the electrical power system, ensure that the  battery is continuously charged in flight, except when short  intermittent loads are connected, such as a radio transmitter,  a landing gear motor, or other similar devices that may place  short-time demand loads on the battery.  

# Controlling or Monitoring the Electrical Load  

Placards are recommended to inform crewmembers of an  aircraft about the combinations of loads that can safely be  connected to the power source.  

In installations where the ammeter is in the battery lead  and the regulator system limits the maximum current that  the generator or alternator can deliver, a voltmeter can be  installed on the system bus. As long as the ammeter does  not read discharge, except for short intermittent loads such  as operating the gear and flaps, and the voltmeter remains at  system voltage, the generator or alternator is not overloaded.  

The ammeter can be redlined at 100 percent of the generator  or alternator rating in installations with the ammeter in the  generator or alternator lead, and the regulator system does  not limit the maximum current that the generator or alternator  can deliver. If the ammeter reading is never allowed to exceed  the red line, except for short, intermittent loads, the generator  or alternator is not overloaded.  

Where the use of placards or monitoring devices is not  practical or desired, and where assurance is needed that the  battery in a typical small aircraft generator or battery power  source is charged in flight, the total continuous connected  electrical load may be held to approximately 80 percent of  the total rated generator output capacity. When more than  one generator is used in parallel, the total rated output is the  combined output of the installed generators.  

Means must be provided for quickly coping with the sudden  overloads that can be caused by generator or engine failure if  two or more generators are operated in parallel and the total  connected system load can exceed the rated output of one  generator. A quick load-reduction system can be employed  or a specified procedure where the total load is reduced to  a quantity that is within the rated capacity of the remaining  operable generator or generators.  

Electrical loads should be connected to inverters, alternators,  or similar aircraft electrical power sources in such a manner  that the rated limits of the power source are not exceeded,  unless some type of effective monitoring means is provided  to keep the load within prescribed limits.  

# Circuit Protection Devices  

Conductors should be protected with circuit breakers or fuses  located as close as possible to the electrical power source  bus. Normally, the manufacturer of the electrical equipment  specifies the fuse or circuit breaker to be used when installing  the equipment.  

The circuit breaker or fuse should open the circuit before the  conductor emits smoke. To accomplish this, the time/current  characteristic of the protection device must fall below that  of the associated conductor. Circuit protector characteristics  should be matched to obtain the maximum utilization of the  connected equipment.  

Figure 4-124  shows an example of the table used in selecting  the circuit breaker and fuse protection for copper conductors.  This limited table is applicable to a specific set of ambient  temperatures and wire bundle sizes and is presented as a  typical example only. It is important to consult such guides  before selecting a conductor for a specific purpose. For  example, a wire run individually in the open air may be  protected by the circuit breaker of the next higher rating to  that shown in the table.  

![](images/bdb3edf39ffad2a226db789389492938ce6d5f9a3913b730e3b1457098b95007.jpg)  

All resettable circuit breakers should open the circuit in which  they are installed, regardless of the position of the operating  control when an overload or circuit fault exists. Such circuit  breakers are referred to as trip-free. Automatic reset circuit  breakers automatically reset themselves periodically. They  should not be used as circuit protection devices in aircraft.  

# Switches  

A specifically designed switch should be used in all circuits  in which a switch malfunction would be hazardous. Such  switches are of rugged construction and have sufficient  contact capacity to break, make, and carry continuously  the connected load current. Snap-action design is generally  preferred to obtain rapid opening and closing of contacts  regardless of the speed of the operating toggle or plunger,  thereby minimizing contact arcing.  

The nominal current rating of the conventional aircraft  switch is usually stamped on the switch housing. This rating  represents the continuous current rating with the contacts  closed. Switches should be derated from their nominal current  rating for the following types of circuits:  

Figure 4-125  is typical of those tables available for selecting  the proper nominal switch rating when the continuous load  current is known. This selection is essentially a derating to  obtain reasonable switch efficiency and service life.  

Hazardous errors in switch operation can be avoided by  logical and consistent installation. Two position on-off  switches should be mounted so that the on position is reached  by an upward or forward movement of the toggle. When the  switch controls movable aircraft elements, such as landing  gear or flaps, the toggle should move in the same direction  as the desired motion. Inadvertent operation of a switch can  be prevented by mounting a suitable guard over the switch.  

# Relays  

Relays are used as switching devices in which a weight  reduction can be achieved or electrical controls can be  simplified. A relay is an electrically operated switch and  is therefore subject to dropout under low system voltage  conditions. The previous discussion of switch ratings is  generally applicable to relay contact ratings.  

![Figure 4-125.   Switch derating factors. ](images/57ba185124e7571bb0f10291b58aedc8b266ab2df597ff53d1f66289cd4955f7.jpg)  

1.	 High rush-in circuits—circuits containing incandescent  lamps can draw an initial current that is 15 times  greater than the continuous current. Contact burning  or welding may occur when the switch is closed. 

 2.	 Inductive circuits—magnetic energy stored in solenoid  coils or relays is released and appears as an arc as the  control switch is opened. 

 3.	 Motors—direct current motors draw several times  their rated current during starting, and magnetic energy  stored in their armature and field coils is released when  the control switch is opened.  

# Chapter 5 Engine Starting Systems  

# Introduction  

Most aircraft engines, reciprocating or turbine, require help  during the starting process. Hence, this device is termed the  starter. A starter is an electromechanical mechanism capable  of developing large amounts of mechanical energy that can  be applied to an engine, causing it to rotate. Reciprocating  engines need only to be turned through at a relatively slow  speed until the engine starts and turns on its own. Once  the reciprocating engine has fired and started, the starter is  disengaged and has no further function until the next start. In  the case of a turbine engine, the starter must turn the engine  up to a speed that provides enough airflow through the engine  for fuel to be ignited. Then, the starter must continue to help  the engine accelerate to a self-sustaining speed. Turbine  engine starters have a critical role in starting of the engine.  

If the starter turns the turbine engine up to a self-sustaining  speed, the engine start process will be successful. There are  only a few types or methods used to turn the engine. Almost  all reciprocating engines use a form of electric motor geared  to the engine. Modern turbine engines use electric motors,  starter/generators (electric motor and a generator in the  same housing), and air turbine starters. Air turbine starters  are driven by compressed air through a turbine wheel that  is mechanically connected through reduction gears to one  of the engine’s compressors, generally the highest pressure  compressor.  

# Reciprocating Engine Starting Systems  

In the early stages of aircraft development, relatively low  powered reciprocating engines were started by pulling the  propeller through a part of a revolution by hand. Difficulty  was often experienced in cold weather starting when  lubricating oil temperatures were near the congealing point.  In addition, the magneto systems delivered a weak starting  spark at the very low cranking speeds. This was often  compensated for by providing a hot spark using such ignition  system devices as the booster coil, induction vibrator, or  impulse coupling.  

Some small, low-powered aircraft which use hand-cranking  of the propeller, or propping, for starting are still being  operated. For general instructions on starting this type of  aircraft, refer to the Aviation Maintenance Technician— General Handbook, Chapter 1, Safety, Ground Operations,  and Servicing. Throughout the development of the aircraft  reciprocating engine from the earliest use of starting systems  to the present, a number of different starter systems have  been used. Most reciprocating engine starters are the direct  cranking electric type. A few older model aircraft are still  equipped with inertia starters. Thus, only a brief description  of these starting systems is included in this section.  

# Inertia Starters  

There are three general types of inertia starters: hand, electric,  and combination hand and electric. The operation of all types  of inertia starters depends on the kinetic energy stored in a  rapidly rotating flywheel for cranking ability. Kinetic energy  is energy possessed by a body by virtue of its state of motion,  which may be movement along a line or spinning action.  

In the inertia starter, energy is stored slowly during an  energizing process by a manual hand crank or electrically

with a small motor. The flywheel and movable gears of  a combination hand electric inertia starter are shown in  Figure 5-1 . The electrical circuit for an electric inertia  starter is shown in  Figure 5-2 . During the energizing of the  starter, all movable parts within it, including the flywheel,  are set in motion. After the starter has been fully energized,  it is engaged to the crankshaft of the engine by a cable  pulled manually or by a meshing solenoid that is energized  electrically. When the starter is engaged, or meshed, flywheel  energy is transferred to the engine through sets of reduction  gears and a torque overload release clutch.  [Figure 5-3]  

# Direct Cranking Electric Starter  

The most widely used starting system on all types of  reciprocating engines utilizes the direct cranking electric  starter. This type of starter provides instant and continual  cranking when energized. The direct cranking electric starter  consists basically of an electric motor, reduction gears, and  an automatic engaging and disengaging mechanism that is  operated through an adjustable torque overload release clutch.  A typical circuit for a direct cranking electric starter is shown  in  Figure 5-4 . The engine is cranked directly when the starter  solenoid is closed. As shown in  Figure 5-4 , the main cables  leading from the starter to the battery are heavy duty to carry  the high current flow, which may be in a range from as high  as 350 amperes to 100 amperes (amps), depending on the  starting torque required. The use of solenoids and heavy   wiring with a remote control switch reduces overall cable  weight and total circuit voltage drop.  

![](images/a62456934c8efaa5256c40a6d0610e4a890cd0c534aa8c9d43418a214216f30b.jpg)

Figure 5-5.   Engine starting schematic for a light twin-engine aircraft.  

The typical starter motor is a 12- or 24-volt, series-wound  motor that develops high starting torque. The torque of  the motor is transmitted through reduction gears to the  overload release clutch. Typically, this action actuates a  helically-splined shaft moving the starter jaw outward  to engage the engine cranking jaw before the starter jaw  begins to rotate. After the engine reaches a predetermined  speed, the starter automatically disengages. The schematic  in  Figure 5-5  provides a pictorial arrangement of an entire  starting system for a light twin-engine aircraft.  

# Direct Cranking Electric Starting System for Large  Reciprocating Engines  

In a typical high horsepower reciprocating engine starting  system, the direct cranking electric starter consists of two  basic components: a motor assembly and a gear section. The  gear section is bolted to the drive end of the motor to form  a complete unit.  

The motor assembly consists of the armature and motor  pinion assembly, the end bell assembly, and the motor  housing assembly. The motor housing also acts as the  magnetic yoke for the field structure.  

The starter motor is a nonreversible, series interpole motor. Its  speed varies directly with the applied voltage and inversely  with the load. The starter gear section consists of an external  housing with an integral mounting flange, planetary gear  reduction, a sun and integral gear assembly, a torque-limiting clutch, and a jaw and cone assembly.  [Figure 5-6]  When the  starter circuit is closed, the torque developed in the starter  motor is transmitted to the starter jaw through the reduction  gear train and clutch. The starter gear train converts the high  speed low torque of the motor to the low speed high torque  required to crank the engine. In the gear section, the motor  pinion engages the gear on the intermediate countershaft.  [Figure 5-6]  The pinion of the countershaft engages the  internal gear. The internal gear is an integral part of the sun  gear assembly and is rigidly attached to the sun gear shaft.  The sun gear drives three planet gears that are part of the  

![](images/9b149036cc47647c30156d1f2eab14d6dbf6bd745482d618277289e82e790499.jpg)  
Figure 5-6.   Starter gear section.  

planetary gear assembly. The individual planet gear shafts  are supported by the planetary carrying arm, a barrel-like  part shown in  Figure 5-6 .  

The carrying arm transmits torque from the planet gears to  the starter jaw as follows:  

1.	 The cylindrical portion of the carrying arm is splined  longitudinally around the inner surface. 2.	 Mating splines are cut on the exterior surface of the  cylindrical part of the starter jaw. 3.	 The jaw slides fore and aft inside the carrying arm to  engage and disengage with the engine.  

The three planet gears also engage the surrounding internal  teeth on the six steel clutch plates.  [Figure 5-6]  These plates  are interleaved with externally splined bronze clutch plates  that engage the sides of the housing, preventing them from  turning. The proper pressure is maintained upon the clutch  pack by a clutch spring retainer assembly. A cylindrical  traveling nut inside the starter jaw extends and retracts the  jaw. Spiral jaw-engaging splines around the inner wall of the  nut mate with similar splines cut on an extension of the sun  gear shaft.  [Figure 5-6]  

Being splined in this fashion, rotation of the shaft forces  the nut out and the nut carries the jaw with it. A jaw spring  around the traveling nut carries the jaw with the nut and  tends to keep a conical clutch surface around the inner wall  of the jaw head seated against a similar surface around the  underside of the nut head. A return spring is installed on the  sun gear shaft extension between a shoulder, formed by the  splines around the inner wall of the traveling nut, and a jaw  stop retaining nut on the end of the shaft. Because the conical  clutch surfaces of the traveling nut and the starter jaw are  engaged by jaw spring pressure, the two parts tend to rotate  at the same speed. However, the sun gear shaft extension  turns six times faster than the jaw. The spiral splines on it  are cut left hand, and the sun gear shaft extension, turning to  the right in relation to the jaw, forces the traveling nut and  the jaw out from the starter its full travel (about  $\%$   inches)  in approximately  $12^{\circ}$   of rotation of the jaw.  

The jaw moves out until it is stopped either by engagement  with the engine or by the jaw stop retaining nut. The travel nut  continues to move slightly beyond the limit of jaw travel, just  enough to relieve some of the spring pressure on the conical  clutch surfaces. As long as the starter continues to rotate,  there is just enough pressure on the conical clutch surfaces  to provide torque on the spiral splines that balance most of  the pressure of the jaw spring. If the engine fails to start,  the starter jaw does not retract since the starter mechanism  provides no retracting force. However, when the engine  fires and the engine jaw overruns the starter jaw, the sloping  ramps of the jaw teeth force the starter jaw into the starter  against the jaw spring pressure. This disengages the conical  clutch surfaces entirely, and the jaw spring pressure forces  the traveling nut to slide in along the spiral splines until the  conical clutch surfaces are again in contact.  

When the starter and engine are both running, there is an  engaging force keeping the jaws in contact that continue  until the starter is de-energized. However, the rapidly moving  engine jaw teeth, striking the slowly moving starter jaw teeth,  hold the starter jaw disengaged. As soon as the starter comes  to rest, the engaging force is removed, and the small return  spring throws the starter jaw into its fully retracted position  where it remains until the next start. When the starter jaw first  engages the engine jaw, the motor armature has had time to  reach considerable speed because of its high starting torque.  The sudden engagement of the moving starter jaw with the  stationary engine jaw would develop forces sufficiently high  enough to severely damage the engine or the starter were it  not for the plates in the clutch pack that slip when the engine  torque exceeds the clutch-slipping torque.  

In normal direct cranking action, the internal steel gear clutch  plates are held stationary by the friction of the bronze plates  with which they are interleaved. When the torque imposed by  the engine exceeds the clutch setting, however, the internal  gear clutch plates rotate against the clutch friction, allowing  the planet gears to rotate while the planetary carrying arm  and the jaw remain stationary. When the engine reaches the  speed that the starter is trying to achieve, the torque drops  off to a value less than the clutch setting, the internal gear  clutch plates are again held stationary, and the jaw rotates at  the speed that the motor is attempting to drive it. The starter  control switches are shown schematically in  Figure 5-7 .  

![](images/f7adfad70ffbadc8a506fafb7bb9676b229d825d511047b5f1ba2278b1875be3.jpg)  
Figure 5-7.   Starter control circuit.  

The engine selector switch must be positioned and the starter  switch and the safety switch—wired in series—must be  closed before the starter can be energized. Current is supplied  to the starter control circuit through a circuit breaker labeled  “Starter, Primer, and Induction Vibrator.”  [Figure 5-7]  When  the engine selector switch is in position for the engine start,  closing the starter energizes the starter relay located in the  engine nacelle area. Energizing the starter relay completes the  power circuit to the starter motor. The current necessary for  this heavy load is taken directly from the master bus through  the starter bus cable.  

All starting systems have operating time limits because of the  high energy used during cranking or rotation of the engine.  These limits are referred to as starter limits and must be  observed or overheating and damage of the starter occurs.  After energizing the starter for 1 minute, it should be allowed  to cool for at least 1 minute. After a second or subsequent  cranking period of 1 minute, it should cool for 5 minutes.  

# Direct Cranking Electric Starting System for Small  Aircraft  

Most small, reciprocating engine aircraft employ a direct  cranking electric starting system. Some of these systems  are automatically engaged starting systems, while others are  manually engaged.  

Manually engaged starting systems used on many older, small  aircraft employ a manually operated overrunning clutch drive  pinion to transmit power from an electric starter motor to a  crankshaft starter drive gear.  [Figure 5-8]  A knob or handle  on the instrument panel is connected by a flexible control to  a lever on the starter. This lever shifts the starter drive pinion  into the engaged position and closes the starter switch contacts  when the starter knob or handle is pulled. The starter lever  is attached to a return spring that returns the lever and the  flexible control to the off position. When the engine starts,  the overrunning action of the clutch protects the starter drive  pinion until the shift lever can be released to disengage the  pinion. For the typical unit, there is a specified length of travel  for the starter gear pinion.  [Figure 5-8]  It is important that the  starter lever move the starter pinion gear this proper distance  before the adjustable lever stud contacts the starter switch.  

The automatic, or remote solenoid engaged, starting systems  employ an electric starter mounted on an engine adapter. A  starter solenoid is activated by either a push button or turning  the ignition key on the instrument panel. When the solenoid  is activated, its contacts close, and electrical energy energizes  the starter motor. Initial rotation of the starter motor engages  the starter through an overrunning clutch in the starter  adapter, which incorporates worm reduction gears.  

![](images/236a20b984875ed8d9b17ad6b2e4ca6a017e350c632f68993d7baa19b9c8df9c.jpg)  
Figure 5-8.   Starter level controls and adjustment.  

Some engines incorporate an automatic starting system that  employs an electric starter motor mounted on a right angle  drive adapter. As the starter motor is electrically energized,  the adapter worm shaft and gear engage the starter shaft gear  by means of a spring and clutch assembly. The shaft gear, in  turn, rotates the crankshaft. When the engine begins to turn  on its own power, the clutch spring disengages from the shaft  gear. The starter adapter uses a worm drive gear shaft and  worm gear to transfer torque from the starter motor to the  clutch assembly.  [Figure 5-9]  As the worm gear rotates the  worm wheel and clutch spring, the clutch spring is tightened  around the drum of the starter shaft gear. As the shaft gear  turns, torque is transmitted directly to the crankshaft gear.  

Other engines use a starter that drives a ring gear mounted to  the propeller hub.  [Figure 5-10]  It uses an electric motor and  a drive gear that engages as the motor is energized and spins  the gear, which moves out and engages the ring gear on the  propeller hub cranking the engine for start.  [Figure 5-11]  As  the engine starts, the starter drive gear is spun back by the  engine turning, which disengages the drive gear.  [Figure 5-12]   The starter motors on small aircraft also have operational  limits with cool down times that should be observed.  

# Reciprocating Engine Starting System Maintenance  Practices  

Most starting system maintenance practices include replacing  the starter motor brushes and brush springs, cleaning dirty  commutators, and turning down burned or out-of-round  

![](images/f1670fe109df1bb3b3410cc8cd392ace97953b53be9774be48032ff5ac8a2507.jpg)

starter commutators. As a rule, starter brushes should be  replaced when worn down to approximately one-half the  original length. Brush spring tension should be sufficient to  give brushes a good firm contact with the commutator. Brush  leads should be unbroken and lead terminal screws tight.  

A glazed or dirty starter commutator can be cleaned by  holding a strip of double-0 sandpaper or a brush seating stone  against the commutator as it is turned. The sandpaper or stone  should be moved back and forth across the commutator to  avoid wearing a groove. Emery paper or carborundum should  never be used for this purpose because of their possible  shorting action.

Figure 5-11.   Starter drive gear mounting holes and electrical  connector.  

Roughness, out-of-roundness, or high-mica conditions are  reasons for turning down the commutator. In the case of a  high-mica condition, the mica should be undercut after the  turning operation is accomplished. Refer to FAA-H-8083-30,  Aviation Maintenance Technician—General for a review of  high-mica commutators in motors.  

The drive gear should be checked for wear along with the  ring gear. The electrical connections should be checked for  looseness and corrosion. Also, check the security of the  mounting of the housing of the starter.  

# Troubleshooting Small Aircraft Starting Systems  

The troubleshooting procedures listed in  Figure 5-13  are  typical of those used to isolate malfunctions in small aircraft  starting systems.  

![](images/3fe0660b195300e6982cde3fab85de66991e5e149cba333adb5485fbacea196d.jpg)  
Figure 5-12.   Engine starter mounted on the engine.  

# Gas Turbine Engine Starters  

Gas turbine engines are started by rotating the high-pressure  compressor. On dual-spool, axial flow engines, the high- pressure compressor and N1 turbine system is only rotated  by the starter. To start a gas turbine engine, it is necessary  to accelerate the compressor to provide sufficient air to  support combustion in the combustion section, or burners.  Once ignition and fuel have been introduced and the lite-off  has occurred, the starter must continue to assist the engine  until the engine reaches a self-sustaining speed. The torque  supplied by the starter must be in excess of the torque required  to overcome compressor inertia and the friction loads of the  engine’s compressor.  

Figure 5-14  illustrates a typical starting sequence for a gas  turbine engine, regardless of the type of starter employed. As  soon as the starter has accelerated the compressor sufficiently  to establish airflow through the engine, the ignition is turned  on followed by the fuel. The exact sequence of the starting  procedure is important since there must be sufficient airflow  through the engine to support combustion before the air-fuel  mixture is ignited. At low engine cranking speeds, the fuel  flow rate is not sufficient to enable the engine to accelerate;  for this reason, the starter continues to crank the engine until  after self-accelerating speed has been attained. If assistance  from the starter were cut off below the self-accelerating  speed, the engine would either fail to accelerate to idle  speed or might even decelerate because it could not produce  sufficient energy to sustain rotation or to accelerate during the  initial phase of the starting cycle. The starter must continue  to assist the engine considerably above the self-accelerating  speed to avoid a delay in the starting cycle, which would  result in a hot or hung false start or a combination of both.  At the proper points in the sequence, the starter and ignition

are automatically cut off. The basic types of starters that  are in current use for gas turbine engines are direct current  (DC) electric motor, starter/generators, and the air turbine  type of starters.  

have been used but most of these have given way to electric  or air turbine starters. An air impingement starting system,  which is sometimes used on small engines, consists of jets of  compressed air piped to the inside of the compressor or turbine  case so that the jet air blast is directed onto the compressor or  turbine rotor blades, causing them to rotate.  

A typical cartridge/pneumatic turbine engine starter may be  operated as an ordinary air turbine starter from a ground- operated air supply or an engine cross-bleed source. It may  also be operated as a cartridge starter.  [Figure 5-15]  To  accomplish a cartridge start, a cartridge is first placed in the  breech cap. The breech is then closed on the breech chamber  by means of the breech handle and then rotated a partial turn to  engage the lugs between the two breech sections. The cartridge  is ignited by applying voltage through the connector at the  end of the breech handle. Upon ignition, the cartridge begins  to generate gas. The gas is forced out of the breech to the hot  gas nozzles that are directed toward the buckets on the turbine  rotor, and rotation is produced via the overboard exhaust  collector. Before reaching the nozzle, the hot gas passes an  outlet leading to the relief valve. This valve directs hot gas  to the turbine, bypassing the hot gas nozzle, as the pressure  rises above the preset maximum. Thus, the pressure of the gas  within the hot gas circuit is maintained at the optimum level.  

Many types of turbine starters have included several different  methods for turning the engine for starting. Several methods  

![](images/6ae2934394948eeac0ded870d6aa7aeca27c1d3313e4f72c25cda496dfcd3f34.jpg)

engines by using the combustion energy of jet A fuel and  compressed air. The starter consists of a turbine-driven power  unit and auxiliary fuel, air, and ignition systems. Operation  of this type starter is, in most installations, fully automatic;  actuation of a single switch causes the starter to fire and  accelerate the engine from rest to starter cutoff speed.  

Hydraulic pumps and motors have also been used for some  smaller engines. Many of these systems are not often used  on modern commercial aircraft because of the high power  demands required to turn the large turbofan engines during  the starting cycle on transport aircraft.  

# Electric Starting Systems & Starter Generator  Starting System  

Electric starting systems for gas turbine aircraft are of  two general types: direct cranking electrical systems and  starter generator systems. Direct cranking electric starting  systems are used mostly on small turbine engines, such as  Auxiliary Power Units (APUs), and some small turboshaft  engines. Many gas turbine aircraft are equipped with starter  generator systems. Starter generator starting systems are  also similar to direct cranking electrical systems except that  after functioning as a starter, they contain a second series of  windings that allow it to switch to a generator after the engine  has reached a self-sustaining speed. This saves weight and  space on the engine.  

The starter generator is permanently engaged with the engine  shaft through the necessary drive gears, while the direct  cranking starter must employ some means of disengaging  the starter from the shaft after the engine has started. The  starter generator unit is basically a shunt generator with an  additional heavy series winding.  [Figure 5-16]  This series  winding is electrically connected to produce a strong field  and a resulting high torque for starting. Starter generator  units are desirable from an economic standpoint, since one  unit performs the functions of both starter and generator.  Additionally, the total weight of starting system components  is reduced and fewer spare parts are required.  

The starter generator internal circuit has four field windings:  a series field (C field), a shunt field, a compensating field,  and an interpole or commutating winding.  [Figure 5-17] During starting, the C field, compensating, and commutating  windings are used. The unit is similar to a direct cranking  starter since all of the windings used during starting are in  series with the source. While acting as a starter, the unit makes  no practical use of its shunt field. A source of 24 volts and  1,500 peak amperes is usually required for starting.  

When operating as a generator, the shunt, compensating,  and commutating windings are used. The C field is used  

![](images/958171d676015857e582f76944b5428bb4f2b3786a454e70309fd061c1952f77.jpg)

only for starting purposes. The shunt field is connected in  the conventional voltage control circuit for the generator.  Compensating and commutating or interpole windings  provide almost sparkless commutation from no load to full  load. Figure 5-18 illustrates the external circuit of a starter generator with an undercurrent controller. This unit controls  the starter generator when it is used as a starter. Its purpose is  

![](images/55e4e29bb9119516a1c28236cb618e59dcd1cac3544cdddc30ca6099a4e5b02c.jpg)  
Figure 5-18.   Starter generator circuit.  

to assure positive action of the starter and to keep it operating  until the engine is rotating fast enough to sustain combustion.  The control block of the undercurrent controller contains  two relays. One is the motor relay that controls the input  to the starter; the other, the undercurrent relay, controls the  operation of the motor relay.  

The sequence of operation for the starting system is discussed  in the following paragraphs.  [Figure 5-18]  To start an engine  equipped with an undercurrent relay, it is first necessary to  close the engine master switch. This completes the circuit  from the aircraft’s bus to the start switch, to the fuel valves,  and to the throttle relay. Energizing the throttle relay starts  the fuel pumps and completing the fuel valve circuit gives  the necessary fuel pressure for starting the engine. As the  battery and start switch is turned on, three relays close: the  motor relay, ignition relay, and battery cutout relay. The motor  relay closes the circuit from the power source to the starter  motor; the ignition relay closes the circuit to the ignition units;  the battery cutout relay disconnects the battery. Opening the  battery circuit is necessary because the heavy drain of the  starter motor would damage the battery. Closing the motor  relay allows a very high current to flow to the motor. Since  this current flows through the coil of the undercurrent relay, it  closes. Closing the undercurrent relay completes a circuit from  the positive bus to the motor relay coil, ignition relay coil, and  battery cutout relay coil. The start switch is allowed to return  to its normal off position, and all units continue to operate.  

As the motor builds up speed, the current draw of the motor  begins to decrease. As it decreases to less than 200 amps,  the undercurrent relay opens. This action breaks the circuit  from the positive bus to the coils of the motor, ignition, and  battery cutout relays. The de-energizing of these relay coils  halts the start operation.  

After these procedures are completed, the engine should be  operating efficiently, and ignition should be self-sustaining.  If, however, the engine fails to reach sufficient speed to halt  the starter operation, the stop switch may be used to break  the circuit from the positive bus to the main contacts of the  undercurrent relay.  

# Troubleshooting a Starter Generator Starting  System  

The procedures listed in  Figure 5-19  are typical of those  used to repair malfunctions in a starter generator starting  system similar to the system described in this section. These  procedures are presented as a guide only. The appropriate  manufacturer’s instructions and approved maintenance  directives should always be consulted for the aircraft involved.  

# Air Turbine Starters  

Air turbine starters are designed to provide high starting  torque from a small, lightweight source. The typical air  turbine starter weighs from one-fourth to one-half as much  as an electric starter capable of starting the same engine. It  is capable of developing considerable more torque than the  electric starter.  

The typical air turbine starter consists of an axial flow turbine  that turns a drive coupling through a reduction gear train and  a starter clutch mechanism. The air to operate an air turbine  starter is supplied from either a ground-operated air cart, the  APU, or a cross-bleed start from an engine already operating.  

[Figure 5-20]  Only one source of around 30–50 pounds per  square inch (psi) is used at a time to start the engines. The  pressure in the ducts must be high enough to provide for a  complete start with a normal limit minimum of about 30 psi.  When starting engines with an air turbine starter, always  check the duct pressure prior to the start attempt.  

Figure 5-21  is a cutaway view of an air turbine starter. The  starter is operated by introducing air of sufficient volume and  pressure into the starter inlet. The air passes into the starter  turbine housing where it is directed against the rotor blades by  the nozzle vanes causing the turbine rotor to turn. As the rotor  turns, it drives the reduction gear train and clutch arrangement,  which includes the rotor pinion, planet gears and carrier, sprag  clutch assembly, output shaft assembly, and drive coupling.  The sprag clutch assembly engages automatically as soon  as the rotor starts to turn but disengages as soon as the drive  coupling turns more rapidly than the rotor side. When the  starter reaches this overrun speed, the action of the sprag  clutch allows the gear train to coast to a halt. The output  shaft assembly and drive coupling continue to turn as long  as the engine is running. A rotor switch actuator, mounted in  the turbine rotor hub, is set to open the turbine switch when  

![Figure 5-19.   Starter generator starting system troubleshooting procedures. ](images/3605c6a697038e6abed2fba1efe5d8ff5c73fc5286ab7d48cc5b86c3556b4bf8.jpg)

the starter reaches cutout speed. Opening the turbine switch  interrupts an electrical signal to the start valve. This closes  the valve and shuts off the air supply to the starter.  

The turbine housing contains the turbine rotor, the rotor  switch actuator, and the nozzle components that direct  the inlet air against the rotor blades. The turbine housing  incorporates a turbine rotor containment ring designed to  dissipate the energy of blade fragments and direct their  discharge at low energy through the exhaust duct in the event  of rotor failure due to excessive turbine overspeed.  

The transmission housing contains the reduction gears, the  clutch components, and the drive coupling. The transmission  housing also provides a reservoir for the lubricating oil.  [Figure 5-22]  Normal maintenance for air turbine starters  includes checking the oil level, inspecting the magnetic chip  detector for metal particles, and checking for leaks. Oil can  be added to the transmission housing sump through a port in  the starter. This port is closed by a vent plug containing a ball  valve that allows the sump to be vented to the atmosphere  during normal flight. The housing also incorporates a sight  gauge that is used to check the oil quantity. A magnetic drain  plug in the transmission drain opening attracts any ferrous  particles that may be in the oil. The starter uses turbine oil,  the same as the engine, but this oil does not circulate through  the engine.  

The ring gear housing, which is internal, contains the rotor  assembly. The switch housing contains the turbine switch  and bracket assembly. To facilitate starter installation and  removal, a mounting adapter is bolted to the mounting pad  on the engine. Quick-detach clamps join the starter to the  mounting adapter and inlet duct.  [Figure 5-22]  Thus, the  starter is easily removed for maintenance or overhaul by  disconnecting the electrical line, loosening the clamps, and  carefully disengaging the drive coupling from the engine  starter drive as the starter is withdrawn.

Figure 5-22.   Air turbine starter.  

The air path is directed through a combination pressure- regulating and shutoff valve, or bleed valve, that controls all  duct pressure flowing to the starter inlet ducting. This valve  regulates the pressure of the starter operating air and shuts off  the air supply to the engine when selected off. Downstream  from the bleed valve is the start valve, which is used to control  air flow into the starter.  [Figure 5-23]  

The pressure-regulating and shutoff valve consists of two  subassemblies: pressure-regulating valve and pressure-

regulating valve control.  [Figure 5-24]  The regulating valve  assembly consists of a valve housing containing a butterfly- type valve.  [Figure 5-24]  The shaft of the butterfly valve is  connected through a cam arrangement to a servo piston. When  the piston is actuated, its motion on the cam causes rotation  of the butterfly valve. The slope of the cam track is designed  to provide small initial travel and high initial torque when the  starter is actuated. The cam track slope also provides more  stable action by increasing the opening time of the valve.  

The control assembly is mounted on the regulating valve  housing and consists of a control housing in which a  solenoid is used to stop the action of the control crank in  the off position.  [Figure 5-24]  The control crank links a  pilot valve that meters pressure to the servo piston, with  the bellows connected by an air line to the pressure-sensing  port on the starter.  

Turning on the starter switch energizes the regulating valve  solenoid. The solenoid retracts and allows the control crank  to rotate to the open position. The control crank is rotated  by the control rod spring moving the control rod against the  closed end of the bellows. Since the regulating valve is closed  and downstream pressure is negligible, the bellows can be  fully extended by the bellows spring.  

As the control crank rotates to the open position, it causes  the pilot valve rod to open the pilot valve, allowing upstream  air, which is supplied to the pilot valve through a suitable  filter and a restriction in the housing, to flow into the servo  piston chamber. The drain side of the pilot valve, which  bleeds the servo chamber to the atmosphere, is now closed  by the pilot valve rod and the servo piston moves inboard.  [Figure 5-24]  This linear motion of the servo piston is  translated to rotary motion of the valve shaft by the rotating  cam, thus opening the regulating valve. As the valve opens,  downstream pressure increases. This pressure is bled  back to the bellows through the pressure-sensing line and  compresses the bellows. This action moves the control rod,  thereby turning the control crank, and moving the pilot valve  rod gradually away from the servo chamber to vent to the  atmosphere.  [Figure 5-24]  When downstream (regulated) pressure reaches a preset value, the amount of air flowing  into the servo through the restriction equals the amount of  air being bled to the atmosphere through the servo bleed; the  system is in a state of equilibrium.  

When the bleed valve and the start valve are open, the  regulated air passing through the inlet housing of the starter

impinges on the turbine causing it to turn. As the turbine  turns, the gear train is activated and the inboard clutch gear,  which is threaded onto a helical screw, moves forward as  it rotates; its jaw teeth engage those of the outboard clutch  gear to drive the output shaft of the starter. The clutch is  an overrunning type to facilitate positive engagement and  minimize chatter. When starter cut-out speed is reached, the  start valve is closed. When the air to the starter is terminated,  the outboard clutch gear, driven by the engine, begins to turn  faster than the inboard clutch gear; the inboard clutch gear,  actuated by the return spring, disengages the outboard clutch  gear allowing the rotor to coast to a halt. The outboard clutch  shaft continues to turn with the engine.

# Chapter 6 Lubrication & Cooling Systems  

# Principles of Engine Lubrication  

The primary purpose of a lubricant is to reduce friction  between moving parts. Because liquid lubricants or oils  can be circulated readily, they are used universally in  aircraft engines. In theory, fluid lubrication is based on the  actual separation of the surfaces so that no metal-to-metal  contact occurs. As long as the oil film remains unbroken,  metallic friction is replaced by the internal fluid friction of  the lubricant. Under ideal conditions, friction and wear are  held to a minimum. Oil is generally pumped throughout the  engine to all areas that require lubrication. Overcoming the  friction of the moving parts of the engine consumes energy  and creates unwanted heat. The reduction of friction during  engine operation increases the overall potential power output.  Engines are subjected to several types of friction.  

# Types of Friction  

Friction may be defined as the rubbing of one object or  surface against another. One surface sliding over another  surface causes sliding friction, as found in the use of plain  bearings. The surfaces are not completely flat or smooth and  have microscopic defects that cause friction between the two  moving surfaces.  [Figure 6-1]  Rolling friction is created  when a roller or sphere rolls over another surface, such as  with ball or roller bearings, also referred to as antifriction  bearings. The amount of friction created by rolling friction is  less than that created by sliding friction and this bearing uses  an outer race and an inner race with balls, or steel spheres,  rolling between the moving parts or races. Another type of  friction is wiping friction, which occurs between gear teeth.  With this type of friction, pressure can vary widely and loads  applied to the gears can be extreme, so the lubricant must be  able to withstand the loads.  

# Functions of Engine Oil  

In addition to reducing friction, the oil film acts as a cushion  between metal parts.  [Figure 6-2]  This cushioning effect is  particularly important for such parts as reciprocating engine  crankshafts and connecting rods, which are subject to shock- loading. As the piston is pushed down on the power stroke,  it applies loads between the connecting rod bearing and  the crankshaft journal. The load-bearing qualities of the oil  must prevent the oil film from being squeezed out, causing  metal-to-metal contact in the bearing. Also, as oil circulates  through the engine, it absorbs heat from the pistons and  cylinder walls. In reciprocating engines, these components  are especially dependent on the oil for cooling.  

Oil cooling can account for up to 50 percent of the total  engine cooling and is an excellent medium to transfer the  heat from the engine to the oil cooler. The oil also aids in  forming a seal between the piston and the cylinder wall to  prevent leakage of the gases from the combustion chamber.  

Oils clean the engine by reducing abrasive wear by picking  up foreign particles and carrying them to a filter where they  are removed. The dispersant, an additive, in the oil holds the  particles in suspension and allows the filter to trap them as the  oil passes through the filter. The oil also prevents corrosion  on the interior of the engine by leaving a coating of oil on  parts when the engine is shut down. This is one of the reasons  why the engine should not be shut down for long periods of  time. The coating of oil preventing corrosion will not last on  

![](images/7207ec13ebcd0795f17d9550bdbe55944a65b41bb670a74288ba19216ac9d7a0.jpg)

The engine’s oil is the life blood of the engine and it is very  important for the engine to perform its function and to extend  the length between overhauls.  

# Requirements & Characteristics of  Reciprocating Engine Lubricants  

While there are several important properties that satisfactory  reciprocating engine oil must possess, its viscosity is most  important in engine operation. The resistance of an oil to flow  is known as its viscosity. Oil that flows slowly is viscous or  has a high viscosity; if it flows freely, it has a low viscosity.  Unfortunately, the viscosity of oil is affected by temperature.  It was not uncommon for earlier grades of oil to become  practically solid in cold weather, increasing drag and making  circulation almost impossible. Other oils may become so thin at  high temperatures that the oil film is broken, causing a low load  carrying ability, resulting in rapid wear of the moving parts.  

The oil selected for aircraft engine lubrication must be light  enough to circulate freely at cold temperatures, yet heavy  enough to provide the proper oil film at engine operating  temperatures. Since lubricants vary in properties and since  no one oil is satisfactory for all engines and all operating  conditions, it is extremely important that only the approved  grade or Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) rating be  used.  

Several factors must be considered in determining the proper  grade of oil to use in a particular engine, the most important of  which are the operating load, rotational speeds, and operating  temperatures. The grade of the lubricating oil to be used  is determined by the operating conditions to be met in the  various types of engines. The oil used in aircraft reciprocating  engines has a relatively high viscosity required by:  

1.	 Large engine operating clearances due to the relatively  large size of the moving parts, the different materials  used, and the different rates of expansion of the various  materials; 2.	 High operating temperatures; and 3.	 High bearing pressures.  

# Viscosity  

Generally, commercial aviation oils are classified by a  number, (such as 80, 100, 140, etc.) that is an approximation  of the viscosity as measured by a testing instrument called  the Saybolt Universal Viscosimeter. In this instrument, a tube  holds a specific quantity of the oil to be tested. The oil is  brought to an exact temperature by a liquid bath surrounding  the tube. The time in seconds required for exactly 60 cubic  centimeters of oil to flow through an accurately calibrated  orifice is recorded as a measure of the oil’s viscosity. If actual  Saybolt values were used to designate the viscosity of oil,  there would probably be several hundred grades of oil.  

To simplify the selection of oils, they are often classified  under an SAE system that divides all oils into seven groups  (SAE 10 to 70) according to viscosity at either   $130~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   or   $210~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . SAE ratings are purely arbitrary and bear no direct  relationship to the Saybolt or other ratings.  

The letter W occasionally is included in the SAE number  giving a designation, such as SAE 20W. This W indicates  that the oil, in addition to meeting the viscosity requirements  at the testing temperature specifications, is satisfactory oil  for winter use in cold climates. This should not be confused  with the W used in front of the grade or weight number that  indicates the oil is of the ashless dispersant type.  

Although the SAE scale has eliminated some confusion in  the designation of lubricating oils, it must not be assumed  that this specification covers all the important viscosity  requirements. An SAE number indicates only the viscosity  grade or relative viscosity; it does not indicate quality or  other essential characteristics. It is well known that there are  good oils and inferior oils that have the same viscosities at a  given temperature and, therefore, are subject to classification  in the same grade.  

The SAE letters on an oil container are not an endorsement  or recommendation of the oil by the SAE. Although each  grade of oil is rated by an SAE number, depending on its  specific use, it may be rated with a commercial aviation  grade number or an Army and Navy specification number.  The correlation between these grade numbering systems is  shown in  Figure 6-3 .  

# Viscosity Index  

The viscosity index is a number that indicates the effect of  temperature changes on the viscosity with the oil. When oil  has a low viscosity index, it signifies a relatively large change  of viscosity of increased temperature. The oil becomes thin  at high temperatures and thick at low temperatures. Oils with  a high viscosity index have small changes in viscosity over  a wide temperature range.  

![Figure 6-3.  Grade designations for aviation oils.  ](images/72c3fbcdd2be757ec577e28feda16808c46c0d5ebe0709880b006b80f8c2853a.jpg)  

The best oil for most purposes is one that maintains a constant  viscosity throughout temperature changes. Oil having a high  viscosity index resists excessive thickening when the engine  is subjected to cold temperatures. This allows for rapid  cranking speeds during starting and prompt oil circulation  during initial startup. This oil resists excessive thinning  when the engine is at operating temperature and provides  full lubrication and bearing load protection.  

# Flash Point & Fire Point  

Flash point and fire point are determined by laboratory tests  that show the temperature at which a liquid begins to give  off ignitable vapors, flash, and the temperature at which  there are sufficient vapors to support a fire. These points  are established for engine oils to determine that they can  withstand the high temperatures encountered in an engine.  

# Cloud Point & Pour Point  

Cloud point and pour point also help to indicate suitability.  The cloud point of oil is the temperature at which its wax  content, normally held in solution, begins to solidify and  separate into tiny crystals, causing the oil to appear cloudy  or hazy. The pour point of oil is the lowest temperature at  which it flows or can be poured.  

# Specific Gravity  

Specific gravity is a comparison of the weight of the  substance to the weight of an equal volume of distilled water  at a specified temperature. As an example, water weighs  approximately 8 pounds to the gallon; oil with a specific  gravity of 0.9 would weigh 7.2 pounds to the gallon.  

In the early years, the performance of aircraft piston engines  was such that they could be lubricated satisfactorily by means  of straight mineral oils, blended from specially selected  petroleum base stocks. Oil grades 65, 80, 100, and 120 are  straight mineral oils blended from selected high-viscosity  index base oils. These oils do not contain any additives except  for very small amounts of pour point depressant, which helps  improve fluidity at very low temperatures, and an antioxidant.  This type of oil is used during the break-in period of a new  aviation piston engine or those recently overhauled.  

Demand for oils with higher degrees of thermal and oxidation  stability necessitated fortifying them with the addition of  small quantities of nonpetroleum materials. The first additives  incorporated in straight mineral piston engine oils were based  on the metallic salts of barium and calcium. In most engines,  the performance of these oils with respect to oxidation and  thermal stability was excellent, but the combustion chambers  of the majority of engines could not tolerate the presence of the  ash deposits derived from these metal-containing additives. To  overcome the disadvantages of harmful combustion chamber  deposits, a nonmetallic (i.e., non-ash forming, polymeric)  additive was developed that was incorporated in blends of  selected mineral oil base stocks. W oils are of the ashless  type and are still in use. The ashless dispersant grades contain  additives, one of which has a viscosity stabilizing effect  that removes the tendency of the oil to thin out at high oil  temperatures and thicken at low oil temperatures.  

The additives in these oils extend operating temperature  range and improve cold engine starting and lubrication of  the engine during the critical warm-up period permitting  flight through wider ranges of climatic changes without the  necessity of changing oil.  

Semi-synthetic multigrade SAE W15 W50 oil for piston  engines has been in use for some time. Oils W80, W100,  and W120 are ashless dispersant oils specifically developed  for aviation piston engines. They combine nonmetallic  additives with selected high viscosity index base oils to  give exceptional stability, dispersancy, and antifoaming  performance. Dispersancy is the ability of the oil to hold  particles in suspension until they can either be trapped by  the filter or drained at the next oil change. The dispersancy  additive is not a detergent and does not clean previously  formed deposits from the interior of the engine.  

Some multigrade oil is a blend of synthetic and mineral- based oil semisynthetic, plus a highly effective additive  package, that is added due to concern that fully synthetic oil  may not have the solvency to handle the lead deposits that  result from the use of leaded fuel. As multigrade oil, it offers  the flexibility to lubricate effectively over a wider range of  temperatures than monograde oils. Compared to monograde  oil, multigrade oil provides better cold-start protection and a  stronger lubricant film (higher viscosity) at typical operating  temperatures. The combination of nonmetallic, antiwear  additives and selected high viscosity index mineral and  synthetic base oils give exceptional stability, dispersancy,  and antifoaming performance. Startup can contribute up to  80 percent of normal engine wear due to lack of lubrication  during the start-up cycle. The more easily the oil flows to  the engine’s components at start up, the less wear occurs.  

The ashless dispersant grades are recommended for aircraft  engines subjected to wide variations of ambient temperature,  particularly the turbocharged series engines that require oil  to activate the various turbo controllers. At temperatures  below  $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , preheating of the engine and oil supply tank is  normally required regardless of the type of oil used.  

Premium, semisynthetic multigrade ashless dispersant oil is  a special blend of a high-quality mineral oil and synthetic  hydrocarbons with an advanced additive package that has  been specifically formulated for multigrade applications.  The ashless antiwear additive provides exceptional wear  protection for wearing surfaces.  

Many aircraft manufacturers add approved preservative  lubricating oil to protect new engines from rust and corrosion  at the time the aircraft leaves the factory. This preservative oil  should be removed at end of the first 25 hours of operation.  When adding oil during the period when preservative oil is  in the engine, use only aviation grade straight mineral oil or  ashless dispersant oil, as required, of the viscosity desired.  

If ashless dispersant oil is used in a new engine, or a newly  overhauled engine, high oil consumption might possibly be  experienced. The additives in some of these ashless dispersant  oils may retard the break in of the piston rings and cylinder  walls. This condition can be avoided by the use of mineral  oil until normal oil consumption is obtained, then change to  the ashless dispersant oil. Mineral oil should also be used  following the replacement of one or more cylinders or until  the oil consumption has stabilized.  

In all cases, refer to the manufacturers’ information when oil  type or time in service is being considered.  

# Reciprocating Engine Lubrication Systems  

Aircraft reciprocating engine pressure lubrication systems  can be divided into two basic classifications: wet sump and  dry sump. The main difference is that the wet sump system  stores oil in a reservoir inside the engine. After the oil is  circulated through the engine, it is returned to this crankcase-  based reservoir. A dry sump engine pumps the oil from the  engine’s crankcase to an external tank that stores the oil.  The dry sump system uses a scavenge pump, some external  tubing, and an external tank to store the oil.  

Other than this difference, the systems use similar types of  components. Because the dry sump system contains all the  components of the wet sump system, the dry sump system  is explained as an example system.  

# Combination Splash & Pressure Lubrication  

The lubricating oil is distributed to the various moving parts  of a typical internal combustion engine by one of the three  following methods: pressure, splash, or a combination of  pressure and splash.  

The pressure lubrication system is the principal method of  lubricating aircraft engines. Splash lubrication may be used  in addition to pressure lubrication on aircraft engines, but it  is never used by itself; aircraft-engine lubrication systems are  always either the pressure type or the combination pressure  and splash type, usually the latter.  

The advantages of pressure lubrication are: 1.	 Positive introduction of oil to the bearings. 2.	 Cooling effect caused by the large quantities of oil  that can be pumped, or circulated, through a bearing. 3.	 Satisfactory lubrication in various attitudes of flight.  

# Lubrication System Requirements  

The lubrication system of the engine must be designed and  constructed so that it functions properly within all flight  attitudes and atmospheric conditions that the aircraft is  expected to operate. In wet sump engines, this requirement  must be met when only half of the maximum lubricant supply  is in the engine. The lubrication system of the engine must  be designed and constructed to allow installing a means of  cooling the lubricant. The crankcase must also be vented to the  atmosphere to preclude leakage of oil from excessive pressure.  

# Dry Sump Oil Systems  

Many reciprocating and turbine aircraft engines have pressure  dry sump lubrication systems. The oil supply in this type of  system is carried in a tank. A pressure pump circulates the  oil through the engine. Scavenger pumps then return it to the  tank as quickly as it accumulates in the engine sumps. The  need for a separate supply tank is apparent when considering  the complications that would result if large quantities of oil  were carried in the engine crankcase. On multiengine aircraft,  each engine is supplied with oil from its own complete and  independent system.  

Although the arrangement of the oil systems in different  aircraft varies widely and the units of which they are composed  differ in construction details, the functions of all such systems  are the same. A study of one system clarifies the general  operation and maintenance requirements of other systems.  

The principal units in a typical reciprocating engine dry  sump oil system include an oil supply tank, an engine-driven  pressure oil pump, a scavenge pump, an oil cooler with an  oil cooler control valve, oil tank vent, necessary tubing, and  pressure and temperature indicators.  [Figure 6-4]  

# Oil Tanks  

Oil tanks are generally associated with a dry sump lubrication  system, while a wet sump system uses the crankcase of the  engine to store the oil. Oil tanks are usually constructed of  aluminum alloy and must withstand any vibration, inertia,  and fluid loads expected in operation.  

Each oil tank used with a reciprocating engine must have  expansion space of not less than the greater of 10 percent  

![](images/429f73dcaa50539ec350f667c70fc68cf09f6e0a3dc5842263bdd1a4e3259f42.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.  Oil system schematic.  

of the tank capacity or 0.5 gallons. Each filler cap of an oil  tank that is used with an engine must provide an oil-tight  seal. The oil tank usually is placed close to the engine and  high enough above the oil pump inlet to ensure gravity feed.  

Oil tank capacity varies with the different types of aircraft, but  it is usually sufficient to ensure an adequate supply of oil for the  total fuel supply. The tank filler neck is positioned to provide  sufficient room for oil expansion and for foam to collect.  

The filler cap or cover is marked with the word OIL. A drain  in the filler cap well disposes of any overflow caused by the  filling operation. Oil tank vent lines are provided to ensure  proper tank ventilation in all attitudes of flight. These lines  are usually connected to the engine crankcase to prevent the  loss of oil through the vents. This indirectly vents the tanks  to the atmosphere through the crankcase breather.  

Early large radial engines had many gallons of oil in their  tank. To help with engine warm up, some oil tanks had a built- in hopper or temperature accelerating well.  [Figure 6-5]  This  well extended from the oil return fitting on top of the oil tank  to the outlet fitting in the sump in the bottom of the tank. In  some systems, the hopper tank is open to the main oil supply  at the lower end. Other systems have flapper-type valves  that separate the main oil supply from the oil in the hopper. The opening at the bottom of the hopper in one type and  the flapper valve-controlled openings in the other allow oil  from the main tank to enter the hopper and replace the oil  consumed by the engine. Whenever the hopper tank includes  

![](images/7a565da5584d8fc7b6d761f68254f064dbaa1c771561f0dde7e5b90baf963ea4.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.  Oil tank with hopper.  

the flapper controlled openings, the valves are operated by  differential oil pressure. By separating the circulating oil from  the surrounding oil in the tank, less oil is circulated. This  hastens the warming of the oil when the engine was started.  Very few of these types of tanks are still in use and most are  associated with radial engine installations.  

Generally, the return line in the top of the tank is positioned  to discharge the returned oil against the wall of the tank in a  swirling motion. This method considerably reduces foaming  that occurs when oil mixes with air. Baffles in the bottom  of the oil tank break up this swirling action to prevent air  from being drawn into the inlet line of the oil pressure pump.  Foaming oil increases in volume and reduces its ability to  provide proper lubrication. In the case of oil-controlled  propellers, the main outlet from the tank may be in the form  of a standpipe so that there is always a reserve supply of  oil for propeller feathering in case of engine failure. An oil  tank sump, attached to the undersurface of the tank, acts as a  trap for moisture and sediment.  [Figure 6-4]  The water and  sludge can be drained by manually opening the drain valve  in the bottom of the sump.  

Most aircraft oil systems are equipped with the dipstick-type  quantity gauge, often called a bayonet gauge. Some larger  aircraft systems also have an oil quantity indicating system  that shows the quantity of oil during flight. One type system  consists essentially of an arm and float mechanism that rides  the level of the oil and actuates an electric transmitter on  top of the tank. The transmitter is connected to a flight deck  

# Oil Pump  

Oil entering the engine is pressurized, filtered, and regulated  by units within the engine. They are discussed along with  the external oil system to provide a concept of the complete  oil system.  

As oil enters the engine, it is pressurized by a gear-type  pump.  [Figure 6-6]  This pump is a positive displacement  pump that consists of two meshed gears that revolve inside  the housing. The clearance between the teeth and housing is  small. The pump inlet is located on the left and the discharge  port is connected to the engine’s system pressure line. One  gear is attached to a splined drive shaft that extends from  the pump housing to an accessory drive shaft on the engine.  Seals are used to prevent leakage around the drive shaft. As  the lower gear is rotated counterclockwise, the driven idler  gear turns clockwise.  

As oil enters the gear chamber, it is picked up by the gear  teeth, trapped between them and the sides of the gear  chamber, then it is carried around the outside of the gears and  discharged from the pressure port into the oil screen passage.  The pressurized oil flows to the oil filter, where any solid  particles suspended in the oil are separated from it, preventing  possible damage to moving parts of the engine.  

Oil under pressure then opens the oil filter check valve  mounted in the top of the filter. This valve is used mostly  

![](images/b5f75ef2612d33fea8ec9eb71a9c9f9275f65062f5c6a9dbc2367fa9c74c777e.jpg)  
Figure 6-6.  Engine oil pump and associated units.  

with dry sump radial engines and is closed by a light spring  loading of 1 to 3 pounds per square inch (psi) when the engine  is not operating to prevent gravity-fed oil from entering  the engine and settling in the lower cylinders or sump area  of the engine. If oil were allowed to gradually seep by the  rings of the piston and fill the combustion chamber, it could  cause a liquid lock. This could happen if the valves on the  cylinder were both closed, and the engine was cranked for  start. Damage could occur to the engine.  

The oil filter bypass valve, located between the pressure side  of the oil pump and the oil filter, permits unfiltered oil to  bypass the filter and enter the engine if the oil filter is clogged  or during cold weather if congealed oil is blocking the filter  during engine start. The spring loading on the bypass valve  allows the valve to open before the oil pressure collapses  the filter; in the case of cold, congealed oil, it provides a  low-resistance path around the filter. Dirty oil in an engine  is better than no lubrication.  

# Oil Filters  

The oil filter used on an aircraft engine is usually one of four  types: screen, Cuno, canister, or spin-on. A screen-type filter  with its double-walled construction provides a large filtering  area in a compact unit.  [Figure 6-6]  As oil passes through the  fine-mesh screen, dirt, sediment, and other foreign matter are  removed and settle to the bottom of the housing. At regular  intervals, the cover is removed, and the screen and housing  cleaned with a solvent. Oil screen filters are used mostly as  suction filters on the inlet of the oil pump.  

The Cuno oil filter has a cartridge made of discs and  spacers. A cleaner blade fits between each pair of discs. The  cleaner blades are stationary, but the discs rotate when the  shaft is turned. Oil from the pump enters the cartridge well  that surrounds the cartridge and passes through the spaces  between the closely spaced discs of the cartridge, then  through the hollow center, and on to the engine. Any foreign  particles in the oil are deposited on the outer surface of the  cartridge. When the cartridge is rotated, the cleaner blades  comb the foreign matter from the discs. The cartridge of the  manually operated Cuno filter is turned by an external handle.  Automatic Cuno filters have a hydraulic motor built into  the filter head. This motor, operated by engine oil pressure,  rotates the cartridge whenever the engine is running. There is  a manual turning nut on the automatic Cuno filter for rotating  the cartridge manually during inspections. This filter is not  often used on modern aircraft.  

A canister housing filter has a replaceable filter element  that is replaced with the rest of the components other than  seals and gaskets being reused.  [Figure 6-7]  The filter  element is designed with a corrugated, strong steel center

tube supporting each convoluted pleat of the filter media,  resulting in a higher collapse pressure rating. The filter  provides excellent filtration, because the oil flows through  many layers of locked-in-fibers.  

Full flow spin-on filters are the most widely used oil filters  for reciprocating engines.  [Figure 6-8]  Full flow means that  all the oil is normally passed through the filter. In a full flow  system, the filter is positioned between the oil pump and the  engine bearings, which filters the oil of any contaminants  before they pass through the engine bearing surfaces. The  filter also contains an antidrain back valve and a pressure  relief valve, all sealed in a disposable housing. The relief  valve is used in case the filter becomes clogged. It would open  to allow the oil to bypass, preventing the engine components  from oil starvation. A cutaway of the micronic filter element  shows the resin-impregnated cellulosic full-pleat media that  is used to trap harmful particles, keeping them from entering  the engine.  [Figure 6-9]  

# Oil Pressure Regulating Valve  

An oil pressure regulating valve limits oil pressure to  a predetermined value, depending on the installation.  [Figure 6-6]  This valve is sometimes referred to as a relief  valve, but its real function is to regulate the oil pressure at a  preset pressure level. The oil pressure must be sufficiently  high to ensure adequate lubrication of the engine and its  

![](images/5c90bf9a54c242b22a8ccfe8c99cf5c8a9241d1006bc33aac9c1a5df70ae5e13.jpg)

accessories at high speeds and powers. This pressure helps  ensure that the oil film between the crankshaft journal and  bearing is maintained. However, the pressure must not be too  high, as leakage and damage to the oil system may result. The  oil pressure is generally adjusted by loosening the locknut  and turning the adjusting screw.  [Figure 6-10]  On most  aircraft engines, turning the screw clockwise increases the  tension of the spring that holds the relief valve on its seat  and increases the oil pressure; turning the adjusting screw  counterclockwise decreases the spring tension and lowers  the pressure. Some engines use washers under the spring that  are either removed or added to adjust the regulating valve  and pressure. The oil pressure should be adjusted only after  the engine’s oil is at operating temperature and the correct  viscosity is verified. The exact procedure for adjusting the  oil pressure and the factors that vary an oil pressure setting  are included in applicable manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Oil Pressure Gauge  

Usually, the oil pressure gauge indicates the pressure that oil  enters the engine from the pump. This gauge warns of possible  engine failure caused by an exhausted oil supply, failure of  the oil pump, burned-out bearings, ruptured oil lines, or other  causes that may be indicated by a loss of oil pressure.  

One type of oil pressure gauge uses a Bourdon-tube  mechanism that measures the difference between oil  pressure and cabin, or atmospheric, pressure. This gauge is  constructed similarly to other Bourdon-type gauges, except  that it has a small restriction built into the instrument case,  or into the nipple connection leading to the Bourdon tube.  This restriction prevents the surging action of the oil pump  from damaging the gauge or causing the pointer to oscillate  too violently with each pressure pulsation. The oil pressure  gauge has a scale ranging from 0–200 psi, or from 0–300 psi.  Operation range markings are placed on the cover glass, or  the face of the gauge, to indicate the safe range of oil pressure  for a given installation.  

A dual-type oil pressure gauge is available for use on  

![](images/70443d80676b2e16702e67d2b78fd8bef7e42bde6686dd71e8a8e81edc6d2cb6.jpg)  
Figure 6-10.  Oil pressure adjustment screw.  

multiengine aircraft. The dual indicator contains two Bourdon  tubes, housed in a standard instrument case; one tube being  used for each engine. The connections extend from the back  of the case to each engine. There is one common movement  assembly, but the moving parts function independently. In  some installations, the line leading from the engine to the  pressure gauge is filled with light oil. Since the viscosity of this  oil does not vary much with changes in temperature, the gauge  responds better to changes in oil pressure. In time, engine oil  mixes with some of the light oil in the line to the transmitter;  during cold weather, the thicker mixture causes sluggish  instrument readings. To correct this condition, the gauge line  must be disconnected, drained, and refilled with light oil.  

The current trend is toward electrical transmitters and  indicators for oil and fuel pressure-indicating systems in all  aircraft. In this type of indicating system, the oil pressure  being measured is applied to the inlet port of the electrical  transmitter where it is conducted to a diaphragm assembly  by a capillary tube. The motion produced by the diaphragm’s  expansion and contraction is amplified through a lever and  gear arrangement. The gear varies the electrical value of the  indicating circuit, which in turn, is reflected on the indicator  in the flight deck. This type of indicating system replaces  long fluid-filled tubing lines with an almost weightless piece  of wire.  

# Oil Temperature Indicator  

In dry-sump lubricating systems, the oil temperature bulb  may be anywhere in the oil inlet line between the supply  tank and the engine. Oil systems for wet-sump engines have  the temperature bulb located where it senses oil temperature  after the oil passes through the oil cooler. In either system, the  bulb is located so that it measures the temperature of the oil  before it enters the engine’s hot sections. An oil temperature  gauge in the flight deck is connected to the oil temperature  bulb by electrical leads. The oil temperature is indicated on  the gauge. Any malfunction of the oil cooling system appears  as an abnormal reading.  

# Oil Cooler  

The cooler, either cylindrical or elliptical shaped, consists  of a core enclosed in a double-walled shell. The core is built  of copper or aluminum tubes with the tube ends formed to  a hexagonal shape and joined together in the honeycomb  effect.  [Figure 6-11]  The ends of the copper tubes of the  core are soldered, whereas aluminum tubes are brazed or  mechanically joined. The tubes touch only at the ends so  that a space exists between them along most of their lengths.  This allows oil to flow through the spaces between the tubes  while the cooling air passes through the tubes.  

The space between the inner and outer shells is known as  

![](images/560c78fbed91022b34286c792096d49e538717f561aeb4f363f6c5920f501768.jpg)  
Figure 6-11.  Oil cooler.  

the annular or bypass jacket. Two paths are open to the flow  of oil through a cooler. From the inlet, it can flow halfway  around the bypass jacket, enter the core from the bottom,  and then pass through the spaces between the tubes and out  to the oil tank. This is the path the oil follows when it is hot  enough to require cooling. As the oil flows through the core,  it is guided by baffles that force the oil to travel back and  forth several times before it reaches the core outlet. The oil  can also pass from the inlet completely around the bypass  jacket to the outlet without passing through the core. Oil  follows this bypass route when the oil is cold or when the  core is blocked with thick, congealed oil.  

# Oil Cooler Flow Control Valve  

As discussed previously, the viscosity of the oil varies with  its temperature. Since the viscosity affects its lubricating  properties, the temperature at which the oil enters an engine  must be held within close limits. Generally, the oil leaving  an engine must be cooled before it is recirculated. Obviously,  the amount of cooling must be controlled if the oil is to return  to the engine at the correct temperature. The oil cooler flow  control valve determines which of the two possible paths the  oil takes through the oil cooler.  [Figure 6-12]  

There are two openings in a flow control valve that fit over  the corresponding outlets at the top of the cooler. When the oil  is cold, a bellows within the flow control contracts and lifts  a valve from its seat. Under this condition, oil entering the  cooler has a choice of two outlets and two paths. Following  the path of least resistance, the oil flows around the jacket  and out past the thermostatic valve to the tank. This allows  the oil to warm up quickly and, at the same time, heats the  

![](images/03260975ecb450f18479a91302289c9e535be18595d0abe4c7c4448b4c7fd33d.jpg)  
Figure 6-12.  Control valve with surge protection.  

oil in the core. As the oil warms up and reaches its operating  temperature, the bellows of the thermostat expand and closes  the outlet from the bypass jacket. The oil cooler flow control  valve, located on the oil cooler, must now flow oil through the  core of the oil cooler. No matter which path it takes through  the cooler, the oil always flows over the bellows of the  thermostatic valve. As the name implies, this unit regulates  the temperature by either cooling the oil or passing it on to  the tank without cooling, depending on the temperature at  which it leaves the engine.  

# Surge Protection Valves  

When oil in the system is congealed, the scavenger pump  may build up a very high pressure in the oil return line. To  prevent this high pressure from bursting the oil cooler or  blowing off the hose connections, some aircraft have surge  protection valves in the engine lubrication systems. One type  of surge valve is incorporated in the oil cooler flow control  valve; another type is a separate unit in the oil return line.  [Figure 6-12]  

The surge protection valve incorporated in a flow control  valve is the more common type. Although this flow control  valve differs from the one just described, it is essentially  the same except for the surge protection feature. The high- pressure operation condition is shown in  Figure 6-12 , in  which the high oil pressure at the control valve inlet has  forced the surge valve (C) upward. Note how this movement  has opened the surge valve and, at the same time, seated  the poppet valve (E). The closed poppet valve prevents oil  from entering the cooler proper; therefore, the scavenge oil  passes directly to the tank through outlet (A) without passing  through either the cooler bypass jacket or the core. When the  pressure drops to a safe value, the spring forces the surge and  poppet valves downward, closing the surge valve (C) and  opening the poppet valve (E). Oil then passes from the control  valve inlet (D), through the open poppet valve, and into the  bypass jacket (F). The thermostatic valve, according to oil  temperature, determines oil flow either through the bypass  jacket to port (H) or through the core to port (G). The check  valve (B) opens to allow the oil to reach the tank return line.  

# Airflow Controls  

By regulating the airflow through the cooler, the temperature  of the oil can be controlled to fit various operating conditions.  For example, the oil reaches operating temperature more  quickly if the airflow is cut off during engine warm-up. There  are two methods in general use: shutters installed on the rear  of the oil cooler, and a flap on the air-exit duct. In some cases,  the oil cooler air-exit flap is opened manually and closed by  a linkage attached to a flight deck lever. More often, the flap  is opened and closed by an electric motor.  

One of the most widely used automatic oil temperature  control devices is the floating control thermostat that provides  manual and automatic control of the oil inlet temperatures.  With this type of control, the oil cooler air-exit door is  opened and closed automatically by an electrically operated  actuator. Automatic operation of the actuator is determined  by electrical impulses received from a controlling thermostat  inserted in the oil pipe leading from the oil cooler to the oil  supply tank. The actuator may be operated manually by an  oil cooler air-exit door control switch. Placing this switch in  the “open” or “closed” position produces a corresponding  movement of the cooler door. Placing the switch in the “auto”  position puts the actuator under the automatic control of the  floating control thermostat.  [Figure 6-13]  The thermostat  shown in  Figure 6-13  is adjusted to maintain a normal oil  temperature so that it does not vary more than approximately   $5^{\circ}$   to  $8\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , depending on the installation.  

During operation, the temperature of the engine oil flowing  over the bimetal element causes it to wind or unwind slightly.  [Figure 6-13B]  This movement rotates the shaft (A) and the  grounded center contact arm (C). As the grounded contact  arm is rotated, it is moved toward either the open or closed  floating contact arm (G). The two floating contact arms are  oscillated by the cam (F), which is continuously rotated by  an electric motor (D) through a gear train (E). When the  grounded center contact arm is positioned by the bimetal  element so that it touches one of the floating contact arms,  an electric circuit to the oil cooler exit-flap actuator motor is  completed, causing the actuator to operate and position the  oil cooler air-exit flap. Newer systems use electronic control  systems, but the function or the overall operation is basically  the same regarding control of the oil temperature through  control of the air flow through the cooler.  

In some lubrication systems, dual oil coolers are used. If the  typical oil system previously described is adapted to two oil  coolers, the system is modified to include a flow divider, two  identical coolers and flow regulators, dual air-exit doors, a  two-door actuating mechanism, and a Y-fitting.  [Figure 6-14] Oil is returned from the engine through a single tube to the  flow divider (E), where the return oil flow is divided equally  into two tubes (C), one for each cooler. The coolers and  regulators have the same construction and operations as the
 cooler and flow regulator just described. Oil from the coolers is  routed through two tubes (D) to a Y-fitting, where the floating  control thermostat (A) samples oil temperature and positions  the two oil cooler air-exit doors through the use of a two-door  actuating mechanism. From the Y-fitting, the lubricating oil is  returned to the tank where it completes its circuit.  

# Dry Sump Lubrication System Operation  

The following lubrication system is typical of those on small,  single-engine aircraft. The oil system and components are  those used to lubricate a 225 horsepower (hp) six-cylinder,  horizontally opposed, air-cooled engine. In a typical dry sump  pressure-lubrication system, a mechanical pump supplies  oil under pressure to the bearings throughout the engine.  [Figure 6-4]  The oil flows into the inlet or suction side of  the oil pump through a suction screen and a line connected to  the external tank at a point higher than the bottom of the oil  sump. This prevents sediment that falls into the sump from  being drawn into the pump. The tank outlet is higher than  the pump inlet, so gravity can assist the flow into the pump.  The engine-driven, positive-displacement, gear-type pump  forces the oil into the full flow filter.  [Figure 6-6]  The oil  either passes through the filter under normal conditions or,  if the filter were to become clogged, the filter bypass valve  would open as mentioned earlier. In the bypass position, the  oil would not be filtered. As seen in  Figure 6-6 , the regulating  (relief) valve senses when system pressure is reached and  opens enough to bypass oil to the inlet side of the oil pump.  Then, the oil flows into a manifold that distributes the oil  

![](images/4f2999b4bcde105ed01d6cb2567b81ff5aa0d0d2707a1cafd70c2d51ea46f48a.jpg)

through drilled passages to the crankshaft bearings and other  bearings throughout the engine. Oil flows from the main  bearings through holes drilled in the crankshaft to the lower  connecting rod bearings.  [Figure 6-15]  

Oil reaches a hollow camshaft (in an inline or opposed  engine), or a cam plate or cam drum (in a radial engine),  through a connection with the end bearing or the main oil  manifold; it then flows out to the various camshaft, cam drum,  or cam plate bearings and the cams.  

The engine cylinder surfaces receive oil sprayed from the  crankshaft and also from the crankpin bearings. Since oil  seeps slowly through the small crankpin clearances before it  is sprayed on the cylinder walls, considerable time is required  for enough oil to reach the cylinder walls, especially on a  cold day when the oil flow is more sluggish. This is one of  the chief reasons for using modern multiviscosity oils that  flow well at low temperatures.  

![](images/9b77a7c406817d0616c03533e8ed4b6f85b87785cec9837b7f0459a2773e2a5d.jpg)  
Figure 6-15.  Oil circulation through the engine.  

When the circulating oil has performed its function of  lubricating and cooling the moving parts of the engine, it  drains into the sumps in the lowest parts of the engine. Oil  collected in these sumps is picked up by gear or gerotor-type  scavenger pumps as quickly as it accumulates. These pumps  have a greater capacity than the pressure pump. This is needed  because the volume of the oil has generally increased due  to foaming (mixing with air). On dry sump engines, this oil  leaves the engine, passes through the oil cooler, and returns  to the supply tank.  

A thermostat attached to the oil cooler controls oil temperature  by allowing part of the oil to flow through the cooler and part  to flow directly into the oil supply tank. This arrangement  allows hot engine oil with a temperature still below   $65~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $(150\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$   to mix with the cold uncirculated oil in the tank. This  raises the complete engine oil supply to operating temperature  in a shorter period of time.  

# Wet-Sump Lubrication System Operation  

A simple form of a wet-sump system is shown in  Figure 6-16 .  The system consists of a sump or pan in which the oil supply  is contained. The oil supply is limited by the sump (oil pan)  capacity. The level (quantity) of oil is indicated or measured  by a vertical rod that protrudes into the oil from an elevated  hole on top of the crankcase. In the bottom of the sump (oil  pan) is a screen strainer having a suitable mesh, or series of  openings, to strain undesirable particles from the oil and yet  pass sufficient quantity to the inlet or (suction) side of the oil  pressure pump.  Figure 6-17  shows a typical oil sump that has  the intake tube running through it. This preheats the air-fuel  mixture before it enters the cylinders.  

The rotation of the pump, which is driven by the engine,  causes the oil to pass around the outside of the gears.  [Figure 6-6]  This develops a pressure in the crankshaft  oiling system (drilled passage holes). The variation in the  

![](images/30323b2e9c187951e73b84ed847a64cc4c5ea771965812f00eaa282321a74f17.jpg)

Figure 6-17.  Wet-sump system’s sump with intake tube running  through it.  

speed of the pump from idling to full-throttle operating range  of the engine and the fluctuation of oil viscosity because of  temperature changes are compensated by the tension on the  relief valve spring. The pump is designed to create a greater  pressure than required to compensate for wear of the bearings  or thinning out of oil. The parts oiled by pressure throw a  lubricating spray into the cylinder and piston assemblies.  After lubricating the various units it sprays, the oil drains  back into the sump and the cycle is repeated. The system is  not readily adaptable to inverted flying since the entire oil  supply floods the engine.  

# Lubrication System Maintenance Practices  

# Oil Tank  

The oil tank, constructed of welded aluminum, is serviced  (filled) through a filler neck located on the tank and equipped  with a spring-loaded locking cap. Inside the tank, a weighted,  flexible rubber oil hose is mounted so that it is repositioned  automatically to ensure oil pickup during all maneuvers. A  dipstick guard is welded inside the tank for the protection  of the flexible oil hose assembly. During normal flight,  the oil tank is vented to the engine crankcase by a flexible  line at the top of the tank. The location of the oil system  components in relation to each other and to the engine is  shown in  Figure 6-18 .  

Repair of an oil tank usually requires that the tank be  removed. The removal and installation procedures normally  remain the same regardless of whether the engine is removed  or not. First, the oil must be drained. Most light aircraft  provide an oil drain similar to that shown in  Figure 6-19 . On  some aircraft, the normal ground attitude of the aircraft may  prevent the oil tank from draining completely. If the amount  of undrained oil is excessive, the aft portion of the tank can  be raised slightly after the tank straps have been loosened to  complete the drainage.  

![](images/15b9d0202b066f1d48a4e2a928149ecc8535c53f0770089e35376a241e199215.jpg)

Figure 6-19.  Oil tank drain.  

After disconnecting the oil inlet and vent lines, the scupper  drain hose and bonding wire can be removed.  [Figure 6-20] The securing straps fitted around the tank can now be  removed.  [Figure 6-21]  Any safety wire securing the clamp  must be removed before the clamp can be loosened and the  strap disconnected. The tank can now be lifted out of the  aircraft. The tank is reinstalled by reversing the sequence used  in the tank removal. After installation, the oil tank should be  filled to capacity.  [Figure 6-22]  

After the oil tank has been filled, the engine should be run for  at least two minutes. Then, the oil level should be checked  and, if necessary, sufficient oil should be added to bring the  oil up to the proper level on the dipstick.  [Figure 6-23]  

# Oil Cooler  

The oil cooler used with this aircraft’s opposed-type engine  is the honeycomb type.  [Figure 6-24]  With the engine  operating and an oil temperature below  $65~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(150~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  , oil  cooler bypass valve opens allowing oil to bypass the core. This valve begins to close when the oil temperature reaches  approximately   $65~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$     $(150~^{\circ}\mathrm{F})$  ). When the oil temperature  reaches  $85\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\,(185\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}),\pm2\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$  , the valve is closed completely,  diverting all oil flow through the cooler core.

# Oil Temperature Bulbs  

Most oil temperature bulbs are mounted in the pressure oil  screen housing. They relay an indication of engine oil inlet  temperature to the oil temperature indicators mounted on  the instrument panel. Temperature bulbs can be replaced by  removing the safety wire and disconnecting the wire leads  from the temperature bulbs, then removing the temperature  bulbs using the proper wrench.  [Figure 6-25]

# Pressure & Scavenge Oil Screens  

Sludge accumulates on the pressure and scavenges oil screens  during engine operation.  [Figure 6-26]  These screens must  be removed, inspected, and cleaned at the intervals specified  by the manufacturer.  

Typical removal procedures include removing the safety  devices and loosening the oil screen housing or cover plate.  A suitable container should be provided to collect the oil that  drains from the filter housing or cavity. The container must  be clean so that the oil collected in it can be examined for  foreign particles. Any contamination already present in the  container gives a false indication of the engine condition.  This could result in a premature engine removal.  

![](images/fd8d6ebf5453eb0af9c1d3af76125f05740f112876859249ee120cae642ae556.jpg)  
Figure 6-25.  Removing oil temperature bulb.  

After the screens are removed, they should be inspected  for contamination and for the presence of metal particles  that may indicate possible engine internal wear, damage,  or in extreme cases, engine failure. The screen must be  cleaned prior to reinstalling in the engine. In some cases,  it is necessary to disassemble the filter for inspection and  cleaning. The manufacturer’s procedures should be followed  when disassembling and reassembling an oil screen assembly.  When reinstalling a filter or screen, use new O-rings and  gaskets and tighten the filter housing or cover retaining nuts  to the torque value specified in the applicable maintenance  manual. Filters should be safetied as required.  

# Oil Pressure Relief Valve  

An oil pressure regulating (relief) valve limits oil pressure to  the value specified by the engine manufacturer. Oil pressure  settings can vary from around 35 psi minimum to around 90  psi maximum, depending on the installation. The oil pressure  must be high enough to ensure adequate lubrication of the  engine and accessories at high speeds and power settings.  On the other hand, the pressure must not be too high, since  leakage and damage to the oil system may result. Before any  attempt is made to adjust the oil pressure, the engine must be  at the correct operating temperature and a check should be  made to assure that the correct viscosity oil is being used in  the engine. One example of adjusting the oil pressure is done  by removing a cover nut, loosening a locknut, and turning  the adjusting screw.  [Figure 6-27]  Turn the adjusting screw  clockwise to increase the pressure, or counterclockwise  to decrease the pressure. Make the pressure adjustments  while the engine is idling and tighten the adjustment screw  lock-nut after each adjustment. Check the oil pressure  reading while the engine is running at the rpm specified in  the manufacturer’s maintenance manual. This may be from  around   $1{,}900~\mathrm{rpm}$   to   ${2,}300~\mathrm{rpm}$  . The oil pressure reading  should be between the limits prescribed by the manufacturer  at all throttle settings.

# Recommendations for Changing Oil  

# Draining Oil  

Oil, in service, is constantly exposed to many harmful  substances that reduce its ability to protect moving parts.  The main contaminants are:  

•	 Gasoline, •	 Moisture, •	 Acids, •	 Dirt, •	 Carbon, and •	 Metallic particles.  

Because of the accumulation of these harmful substances,  common practice is to drain the entire lubrication system at  regular intervals and refill with new oil. The time between  oil changes varies with each make and model aircraft and  engine combination.  

In engines that have been operating on straight mineral oil  for several hundred hours, a change to ashless dispersant  oil should be made with a degree of caution as the cleaning  action of some ashless dispersant oils tends to loosen sludge  deposits and cause plugged oil passages. When an engine has  been operating on straight mineral oil, and is known to be in  excessively dirty condition, the switch to ashless dispersant  oil should be deferred until after the engine is overhauled.  

When changing from straight mineral oil to ashless dispersant  oil, the following precautionary steps should be taken:  

1.	 Do not add ashless dispersant oil to straight mineral  oil. Drain the straight mineral oil from the engine and  fill with ashless dispersant oil.  2.	 Do not operate the engine longer than 5 hours before  the first oil change.  

3.	 Check all oil filters and screens for evidence of sludge  or plugging. Change oil every 10 hours if sludge  conditions are evident. Repeat 10-hour checks until  clean screen is noted, then change oil at recommended  time intervals.  4.	 All turbocharged engines must be broken in and  operated with ashless dispersant oil.  

# Oil & Filter Change & Screen Cleaning  

One manufacturer recommends that for new, remanufactured;  or newly overhauled engines and for engines with any newly  installed cylinders, the oil should be changed after the first  replacement/screen cleaning at 25 hours. The oil should be  changed, filter replaced, or pressure screen cleaned, and oil  sump suction screen cleaned and inspected. A typical interval  for oil change is 25 hours, along with a pressure screen  cleaning and oil sump suction screen check for all engines  employing a pressure screen system. Typical 50-hour interval  oil changes generally include the oil filter replacement and  suction screen check for all engines using full-flow filtration  systems. A time maximum of 4 months between servicing is  also recommended for oil system service.  

# Oil Filter Removal Canister Type Housing  

Remove the filter housing from the engine by removing the  safety wire and loosening the hex head screw and housing  by turning counterclockwise and removing the filter from  the engine.  [Figure 6-7]  Remove the nylon nut that holds  the cover plate on the engine side of the filter. Remove the  cover plate, hex head screw from the housing. To remove the  spin-on type of filter, cut the safety wire and use the wrench  pad on the rear of the filter to turn the filter counterclockwise,  and remove filter. Inspect the filter element as described in  the following paragraph. Discard old gaskets and replace  with new replacement kit gaskets.  

# Oil Filter/Screen Content Inspection  

Check for premature or excessive engine component wear  that is indicated by the presence of metal particles, shavings,  or flakes in the oil filter element or screens. The oil filter  can be inspected by opening the filter paper element. Check  the condition of the oil from the filter for signs of metal  contamination. Then, remove the paper element from the  filter and carefully unfold the paper element; examine the  material trapped in the filter. If the engine employs a pressure  screen system, check the screen for metal particles. After  draining the oil, remove the suction screen from the oil sump  and check for metal particles.  [Figure 6-28]  If examination of  the used oil filter or pressure screen and the oil sump suction  screen indicates abnormal metal content, additional service  may be required to determine the source and possible need for  corrective maintenance. To inspect the spin on filter the can  must be cut open to remove the filter element for inspection.

Figure 6-28.  Oil sump screen.  

Using the special filter cutting tool, slightly tighten the  cutter blade against filter and rotate  $360^{\circ}$   until the mounting  plate separates from the can.  [Figure 6-29]  Using a clean  plastic bucket containing varsol, move the filter to remove  contaminants. Use a clean magnet and check for any ferrous metal particles in the filter or varsol solution. Then, take the  remaining varsol and pour it through a clean filter or shop  towel. Using a bright light, inspect for any nonferrous metals.  

# Assembly of & Installation of Oil Filters  

After cleaning the parts, installation of the canister or filter  element type filter is accomplished by lightly oiling the new  rubber gaskets and installing a new copper gasket on the  hex head screw. Assemble the hex head screw into the filter  case using the new copper gasket. Install the filter element  and place the cover over the case, then manually thread on  the nylon nut by hand. Install the housing on the engine by  turning it clockwise, then torque and safety it. Spin-on filters  generally have installation instructions on the filter. Place a  coating of engine oil on the rubber gasket, install the filter,  torque and safety it. Always follow the manufacturer’s current  instructions to perform any maintenance.  

# Troubleshooting Oil Systems  

The outline of malfunctions and their remedies listed in  Figure 6-30  can expedite troubleshooting of the lubrication  system. The purpose of this section is to present typical  troubles. It is not intended to imply that any of the troubles  are exactly as they may be in a particular aircraft.  

# Requirements for Turbine Engine Lubricants  

There are many requirements for turbine engine lubricating  oils. Due to the absence of reciprocating motion and the  presence of ball and roller bearings (antifriction bearings),  the turbine engine uses a less viscous lubricant. Gas turbine  engine oil must have a high viscosity for good load-carrying  ability but must also be of sufficiently low viscosity to  provide good flowability. It must also be of low volatility  to prevent loss by evaporation at the high altitudes at which  the engines operate. In addition, the oil should not foam and  should be essentially nondestructive to natural or synthetic  rubber seals in the lubricating system. Also, with high-speed  antifriction bearings, the formation of carbons or varnishes  must be held to a minimum. Synthetic oil for turbine engines  are usually supplied in sealed one-quart cans.  

The many requirements for lubricating oils are met in the  synthetic oils developed specifically for turbine engines.  Synthetic oil has two principal advantages over petroleum oil.  It has a lower tendency to deposit lacquer and coke (solids  left after solvents have been evaporated) because it does not  evaporate the solvents from the oil at high temperature. Oil  grades used in some turbine engines normally contain thermal  and oxidation preventives, load-carrying additives, and  substances that lower the pour point in addition to synthetic  chemical-base materials. MIL-L-7808, which is a military  specification for turbine oil, is a type I turbine oil. Turbine  synthetic oil has a viscosity of around 5 to 5.5 centistokes  at  $210^{\mathrm{o}}\,\mathrm{F}$   that is approved against the military specification  MIL-PRF-23699F. This oil is referred to as type II turbine  oil. Most turbine oils meet this type II specification and are  made with the following characteristics:  

1.	 Vapor phase deposits—carbon deposits formed from  oil mist and vapor contact with hot engine surfaces. 2.	 Load-carrying ability—provides for heavy loads on  

![](images/e7f0fe0a2cbcf0730352d061d1361de766aab9382bceefa88982c9a1883b7c26.jpg)

the bearing systems of turbine engines.  

3.	 Cleanliness—minimum formation of sludge deposits  during severe operation.  

4.	 Bulk stability—resistance to physical or chemical  change resulting from oxidation. Permits long periods  of service operation without significant increase  in viscosity or total acidity, the main indicators of  oxidation.  

5.	 Compatibility—most turbine oil is compatible with  other oils that meet the same military specification.  But, most engine manufacturers do not recommend  the indiscriminate mixing of approved oil brands and  

this is not a generally accepted practice.  6.	 Seal Wear—essential for the life of engines with  carbon seals that lubricant properties prevent wear of  the carbon at the carbon seal face.  

# Turbine Oil Health & Safety Precautions  

Under normal conditions, the use of turbine oil presents a  low health risk for humans. Although each person reacts  somewhat differently to exposure, contact with liquids,  vapors, and mist of turbine oil should be minimized.  Information on established limits on exposure to turbine  oil can generally be found in the material safety data  sheets (MSDS). Prolonged breathing of hydrocarbon vapor  concentrations in excess of the prescribed limits may result  in lightheadedness, dizziness, and nausea. If turbine oil is  ingested, call a doctor immediately; identify the product and  how much was ingested. Because of the risk of ingestion,  petroleum products should never be siphoned by mouth.  

Prolonged or repeated contact of turbine oil with the skin can  cause irritation and dermatitis. In case of skin contact, wash  the skin thoroughly with soap and warm water. Promptly  remove oil-soaked clothing and wash. If turbine oil contacts  the eyes, flush the eyes with fresh water until the irritation  subsides. Protective clothing, gloves, and eye protection  should be used when handling turbine oil.  

During operation, it is possible for the oil to be subjected to  very high temperatures that can break it down and produce a  product of unknown toxicity. If this happens, all precautions  to avoid explosives should be taken. It can also have a  tendency to blister, discolor, or remove paint whenever it  is spilled. Painted surfaces should be wiped clean with a  petroleum solvent after spillage.  

# Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program  

The Spectrometric Oil Analysis Program allows an oil  sample to be analyzed and searched for the presence of  minute metallic elements. Due to oil circulation throughout  an aircraft engine, every lubricant that is in service contains  microscopic particles of metallic elements called wear metals.  As the engine operates over time, the oil picks up very  small particles that stay suspended in the oil. Oil analysis  programs identify and measure these particles in parts per  million (PPM) by weight. The analyzed elements are grouped  into categories, such as wear metals and additives, and their  measurement in PPM provides data that expert analysts can  use as one of many tools to determine the engine’s condition.  An increase in PPM of certain materials can be a sign of  component wear or impending failure of the engine. When  you take a sample, note and record the amount of wear metals.  If the amount of wear metals increases beyond a normal  rate, then the operator can be notified quickly so repair or  a recommendation of a specific maintenance procedure or  inspection can be ordered.  

Oil analysis increases safety by identifying an engine problem  before engine failure. It also saves money by finding engine  problems before they become large problems or complete  engine failure. This procedure can be used for both turbine  and reciprocating engines.  

# Typical Wear Metals & Additives  

The following examples of wear metals are associated  with areas of the engine that could be lead to their source.  Identifying the metal can help identify the engine components  that are wearing or failing.  

•	 Iron—wear from rings, shafts, gears, valve train,  cylinder walls, and pistons in some engines. •	 Chromium—primary sources are chromed parts (such  as rings, liners, etc.) and some coolant additives. •	 Nickel—secondary indicator of wear from certain  types of bearings, shafts, valves, and valve guides. •	 Aluminum—indicates wear of pistons, rod bearings,  and certain types of bushings. •	 Lead—mostly from tetraethyl lead contamination. •	 Copper—wear from bearings, rocker arm bushings,  wrist pin bushings, thrust washers, and other bronze  or  brass parts, and oil additive or antiseize compound. •	 Tin—wear from bearings.  •	 Silver—wear of bearings that contain silver and, in  some instances, a secondary indicator of oil cooler  problems. •	 Titanium—alloy in high-quality steel for gears and  bearings. •	 Molybdenum—gear or ring wear and used as an  additive in some oils. •	 Phosphorous—antirust agents, spark plugs, and  combustion chamber deposits.  

# Turbine Engine Lubrication Systems  

Both wet- and dry-sump lubrication systems are used in  gas turbine engines. Wet-sump engines store the lubricating  oil in the engine proper, while dry-sump engines utilize an  external tank mounted on the engine or somewhere in the  aircraft structure near the engine, similar to reciprocating  piston engines mentioned earlier.  

Turbine engine’s oil systems can also be classified as a  pressure relief system that maintains a somewhat constant  pressure: the full flow type of system, in which the pressure  varies with engine speed, and the total loss system, used in  engines that are for short duration operation (target drones,  missiles, etc.). The most widely used system is the pressure  relief system with the full flow used mostly on large fan- type engines. One of the main functions of the oil system in  turbine engines is cooling the bearings by carrying the heat  away from the bearing by circulating oil around the bearing.  

The exhaust turbine bearing is the most critical lubricating  point in a gas turbine engine because of the high temperature  normally present. In some engines, air cooling is used in  addition to oil cooling the bearing, which supports the turbine.  Air cooling, referred to as secondary air flow, is cooling air  provided by bleed air from the early stages of the compressor.  

This internal air flow has many uses on the inside of the  engine. It is used to cool turbine disc, vanes, and blades.  Also, some turbine wheels may have bleed air flowing over  the turbine disc, which reduces heat radiation to the bearing  surface. Bearing cavities sometimes use compressor air to aid  in cooling the turbine bearing. This bleed air, as it is called,  is usually bled off a compressor stage at a point where air  has enough pressure but has not yet become too warm (as  the air is compressed, it becomes heated).  

The use of cooling air substantially reduces the quantity of  oil necessary to provide adequate cooling of the bearings.  Since cooling is a major function of the oil in turbine engines,  the lubricating oil for bearing cooling normally requires an  oil cooler. When an oil cooler is required, usually a greater  quantity of oil is necessary to provide for circulation between  the cooler and engine. To ensure proper temperature, oil  is routed through either air-cooled and/or fuel-cooled oil  coolers. This system is used to also heat (regulate) the fuel  to prevent ice in the fuel.  

# Turbine Lubrication System Components  

The following component descriptions include most found  in the various turbine lubrication systems. However, since  engine oil systems vary somewhat according to engine model  and manufacturer, not all of these components are necessarily  found in any one system.  

# Oil Tank  

Although the dry-sump systems use an oil tank that contains  most of the oil supply, a small sump is usually included on the  engine to hold a small supply of oil. It usually contains the  oil pump, the scavenge and pressure inlet strainers, scavenge  return connection, pressure outlet ports, an oil filter, and  mounting bosses for the oil pressure gauge and temperature  bulb connections.  

A view of a typical oil tank is shown in  Figure 6-31 . It is  designed to furnish a constant supply of oil to the engine  during any aircraft attitude. This is done by a swivel outlet  assembly mounted inside the tank, a horizontal baffle  mounted in the center of the tank, two flapper check valves  mounted on the baffle, and a positive vent system.  

The swivel outlet fitting is controlled by a weighted end  that is free to swing below the baffle. The flapper valves  in the baffle are normally open; they close only when the  oil in the bottom of the tank tends to rush to the top of the  tank during decelerations. This traps the oil in the bottom of  the tank where it is picked up by the swivel fitting. A sump  drain is located in the bottom of the tank. The vent system  inside the tank is so arranged that the airspace is vented at  all times even though oil may be forced to the top of the tank  by deceleration of the aircraft.  

All oil tanks are provided with expansion space. This allows  

![](images/5fa56fbb3a88ee9e6634132de922d27400873abbf1d092dc58b8cd9256cf215d.jpg)  
Figure 6-31.  Oil tank.  

expansion of the oil after heat is absorbed from the bearings  and gears and after the oil foams as a result of circulating  through the system. Some tanks also incorporate a deaerator  tray for separating air from the oil returned to the top of the  tank by the scavenger system. Usually these deaerators are  the can type in which oil enters at a tangent. The air released  is carried out through the vent system in the top of the tank.  In most oil tanks, a pressure buildup is desired within the  tank to ensure a positive flow of oil to the oil pump inlet.  This pressure buildup is made possible by running the vent  line through an adjustable check relief valve. The check  relief valve is usually set to relieve at about 4 psi, keeping  positive pressure on the oil pump inlet. If the air temperature  is abnormally low, the oil may be changed to a lighter  grade. Some engines may provide for the installation of an  immersion-type oil heater.  

# Oil Pump  

The oil pump is designed to supply oil under pressure to the  parts of the engine that require lubrication, then circulate the  oil through coolers as needed, and return the oil to the oil  tank. Many oil pumps consist of not only a pressure supply  element, but also scavenge elements, such as in a dry-sump  system. However, there are some oil pumps that serve a single  function; that is, they either supply or scavenge the oil. These  pump elements can be located separate from each other and  driven by different shafts from the engine. The numbers  of pumping elements (two gears that pump oil), pressure  and scavenge, depend largely on the type and model of the  engine. Several scavenge oil pump elements can be used  to accommodate the larger capacity of oil and air mix. The  scavenge elements have a greater pumping capacity than the  pressure element to prevent oil from collecting in the bearing  sumps of the engine.  

The pumps may be one of several types, each type having  certain advantages and limitations. The two most common  oil pumps are the gear and gerotor, with the gear-type being  the most commonly used. Each of these pumps has several  possible configurations.  

The gear-type oil pump has only two elements: one for  pressure oil and one for scavenging.  [Figure 6-32]  However,  some types of pumps may have several elements: one or more  

![](images/eb2b374395a6d1fda7a27e0ada890160e8333e377d73fc5703d9df824492ce12.jpg)  

elements for pressure and two or more for scavenging. The  clearances between the gear teeth and the sides of the pump  wall and plate are critical to maintain the correct output of  the pump.  

A regulating (relief) valve in the discharge side of the pump  limits the output pressure of the pump by bypassing oil to the  pump inlet when the outlet pressure exceeds a predetermined  limit.  [Figure 6-32]  The regulating valve can be adjusted, if  needed, to bring the oil pressure within limits. Also shown  is the shaft shear section that causes the shaft to shear if the  pump gears should seize up and not turn.  

The gerotor pump, like the gear pump, usually contains  a single element for oil pressure and several elements for  scavenging oil. Each of the elements, pressure and scavenge,  is almost identical in shape; however, the capacity of  the elements can be controlled by varying the size of the  gerotor elements. For example, the pressure element may  have a pumping capacity of 3.1 gallons per minute (gpm) as  compared to  $4.25~\mathrm{gpm}$   capacity for the scavenge elements.  Consequently, the pressure element is smaller since the  elements are all driven by a common shaft. The pressure is  determined by engine rpm with a minimum pressure at idling  speed and maximum pressure at intermediate and maximum  engine speeds.  

A typical set of gerotor pumping elements is shown in  Figure 6-33 . Each set of gerotors is separated by a steel plate,  making each set an individual pumping unit consisting of  an inner and an outer element. The small star-shaped inner  element has external lobes that fit within and are matched  with the outer element that has internal lobes. The small  element fits on and is keyed to the pump shaft and acts as a  drive for the outer free-turning element. The outer element fits  within a steel plate having an eccentric bore. In one engine  model, the oil pump has four elements: one for oil feed and  three for scavenge. In some other models, pumps have six  elements: one for feed and five for scavenge. In each case,  the oil flows as long as the engine shaft is turning.

# Turbine Oil Filters  

Filters are an important part of the lubrication system  because they remove foreign particles that may be in the  oil. This is particularly important in gas turbines as very  high engine speeds are attained; the antifriction types of ball  and roller bearings would become damaged quite rapidly  if lubricated with contaminated oil. Also, there are usually  numerous drilled or core passages leading to various points  of lubrication. Since these passages are usually rather small,  they are easily clogged.  

There are several types and locations of filters used for  filtering the turbine lubricating oil. The filtering elements  come in a variety of configurations and mesh sizes. Mesh  sizes are measured in microns, which is a linear measurement  equal to one millionth of a meter (a very small opening).  

![](images/ba6a3289a4b872cab16111a2cbfb6cc78d7b39dc7053c9cb033f96a2d20aaee7.jpg)

Figure 6-35.  Turbine oil filter paper element.  

A main oil strainer filter element is shown in  Figure 6-34 The filtering element interior is made of varying materials  including paper and metal mesh.  [Figure 6-35]  Oil normally  flows through the filter element from the outside into the  filter body. One type of oil filter uses a replaceable laminated  paper element, while others use a very fine stainless steel  metal mesh of about 25–35 microns.  

Most filters are located close to the pressure pump and consist  of a filter body or housing, filter element, a bypass valve, and  a check valve. The filter bypass valve prevents the oil flow  from being stopped if the filter element becomes clogged. The  bypass valve opens whenever a certain pressure is reached.  If this occurs, the filtering action is lost, allowing unfiltered  oil to be pumped to the bearings. However, this prevents the  bearings from receiving no oil at all. In the bypass mode,  many engines have a mechanical indicator that pops out to  indicate the filter is in the bypass mode. This indication is  visual and can only be seen by inspecting the engine directly.  An antidrain check valve is incorporated into the assembly to  prevent the oil in the tank from draining down into the engine  sumps when the engine is not operating. This check valve is  normally spring loaded closed with 4 to 6 psi needed to open it.  

The filters generally discussed are used as main oil filters;  that is, they strain the oil as it leaves the pump before being piped to the various points of lubrication. In addition to  the main oil filters, there are also secondary filters located  throughout the system for various purposes. For instance,  there may be a finger screen filter that is sometimes used  for straining scavenged oil. These screens tend to be large  mesh screens that trap larger contaminants. Also, there are  fine-mesh screens called last chance filters for straining  the oil just before it passes from the spray nozzles onto the  bearing surfaces.  [Figure 6-36]  These filters are located at  each bearing and help screen out contaminants that could  plug the oil spray nozzle.  

![](images/148fd57e0e861bc7d6c69e6723d6926ef0b991a44ae0093b3dbd78bdc84afbe0.jpg)  
Figure 6-36.  Last-chance filter before spray nozzle.  

# Oil Pressure Regulating Valve  

Most turbine engine oil systems are pressure regulating type  systems that keep the pressure fairly constant. An oil pressure  regulating valve is included in the oil system on the pressure  side of the pressure pump. A regulating valve system controls  the systems pressure to a limited pressure within the system.  It is more of a regulating valve than a relief valve because it  keeps the pressure in the system within certain limits other  than only opening when the absolute maximum pressure of  the system is exceeded.  

The regulating valve  Figure 6-37  has a valve held against a  seat by a spring. By adjusting the tension (increase) on the  spring, you change the pressure at which the valve opens, and  you also increase the system pressure. A screw pressing on the  spring adjusts the tension on the valve and the system pressure.  

# Oil Pressure Relief Valve  

Some large turbofan oil systems do not have a regulating valve.  The system pressure varies with engine rpm and pump speed.  There is a wide range of pressure in this system. A relief valve  is used to relieve pressure only if it exceeds the maximum limit  for the system.  [Figure 6-38]  This true relief valve system  is preset to relieve pressure and bypass the oil back to the  inlet side of the oil pump whenever the pressure exceeds the  maximum preset system limit. This relief valve is especially  important when oil coolers are incorporated in the system  since the coolers are easily ruptured because of their thin-wall  construction. Under normal operation, it should never open.  

![](images/1ea5e3bb056de046d2e4e32a7932b2ecc5920322282449567b037d72b8e5bd46.jpg)

Figure 6-39.  Oil nozzles spray lubricate on bearings.  

# Oil Jets  

Oil jets (or nozzles) are located in the pressure lines adjacent  to, or within, the bearing compartments and rotor shaft  couplings.  [Figure 6-39]  The oil from these nozzles is  delivered in the form of an atomized spray. Some engines use  an air-oil mist spray that is produced by tapping high-pressure  bleed air from the compressor to the oil nozzle outlet. This  method is considered adequate for ball and roller bearings;  however, the solid oil spray method is considered the better  of the two methods.  

The oil jets are easily clogged because of the small orifice in  their tips; consequently, the oil must be free of any foreign  particles. If the last-chance filters in the oil jets should become  clogged, bearing failure usually results since nozzles are not  accessible for cleaning except during engine maintenance.  To prevent damage from clogged oil jets, main oil filters are  checked frequently for contamination.  

# Lubrication System Instrumentation  

Gauge connection provisions are incorporated in the oil  system for oil pressure, oil quantity, low oil pressure, oil  filter differential pressure switch, and oil temperature. The  oil pressure gauge measures the pressure of the lubricant as  it leaves the pump and enters the pressure system. The oil  pressure transmitter connection is located in the pressure  line between the pump and the various points of lubrication.  An electronic sensor is placed to send a signal to the Full  Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) control unit and  through the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System 

 (EICAS) computers, and on to the displays in the flight deck. 

 [Figure 6-40]  The tank quantity transmitter information is  sent to the EICAS computers. The low oil pressure switch  alerts the crew if the oil pressure falls below a certain pressure  during engine operation. The differential oil pressure switch  alerts the flight crew of an impending oil filter bypass because  of a clogged filter. A message is sent to the display in the  upper EICAS display in the flight deck as can be seen in  Figure 6-40 . Oil temperature can be sensed at one or more  points in the engine’s oil flow path. The signal is sent to the  FADEC/EICAS computer and is displayed on the lower  EICAS display.  

# Lubrication System Breather Systems (Vents)  

Breather subsystems are used to remove excess air from the  bearing cavities and return the air to the oil tank where it is  separated from any oil mixed in the vapor of air and oil by  the deaerator. Then, the air is vented overboard and back to  the atmosphere. All engine bearing compartments, oil tanks,  and accessory cases are vented together so the pressure in  the system remains the same.  

The vent in an oil tank keeps the pressure within the tank  from rising above or falling below that of the outside  atmosphere. However, the vent may be routed through  a check relief valve that is preset to maintain a slight  (approximately 4 psi) pressure on the oil to assure a positive  flow to the oil pump inlet.  

In the accessory case, the vent (or breather) is a screen- protected opening that allows accumulated air pressure  within the accessory case to escape to the atmosphere. The  scavenged oil carries air into the accessory case and this air  

![](images/55dabe31c1800704a5ea6db77e8fc49e5d256bde6e53cc8461f9674a8550c8c3.jpg)  
Figure 6-40.  Oil indicating system.  

must be vented. Otherwise, the pressure buildup within the  accessory case would stop the flow of oil draining from the  bearing, forcing this oil past the bearing oil seals and into  the compressor housing. If in enough quantity, oil leakage  could cause burning and seal and bearing malfunction. The  screened breathers are usually located in the front center  of the accessory case to prevent oil leakage through the  breather when the aircraft is in unusual flight attitudes.  Some breathers may have a baffle to prevent oil leakage  during flight maneuvers. A vent that leads directly to the  bearing compartment may be used in some engines. This  vent equalizes pressure around the bearing surface so that the  lower pressure at the first compressor stage does not cause oil  to be forced past the bearing rear oil seal into the compressor.  

# Lubrication System Check Valve  

Check valves are sometimes installed in the oil supply lines  of dry-sump oil systems to prevent reservoir oil from seeping  (by gravity) through the oil pump elements and high-pressure  lines into the engine after shutdown. Check valves, by  stopping flow in an opposite direction, prevent accumulations  of undue amounts of oil in the accessory gearbox, compressor  rear housing, and combustion chamber. Such accumulations  could cause excessive loading of the accessory drive gears  during starts, contamination of the cabin pressurization  air, or internal oil fires. The check valves are usually the  spring-loaded ball-and-socket type constructed for free flow  of pressure oil. The pressure required to open these valves

varies, but the valves generally require from 2 to 5 psi to  permit oil to flow to the bearings.  

# Lubrication System Thermostatic Bypass Valves  

Thermostatic bypass valves are included in oil systems  using an oil cooler. Although these valves may be called  different names, their purpose is always to maintain proper  oil temperature by varying the proportion of the total oil  flow passing through the oil cooler. A cutaway view of a  typical thermostatic bypass valve is shown in  Figure 6-41 .  This valve consists of a valve body, having two inlet ports  and one outlet port, and a spring-loaded thermostatic element  valve. The valve is spring loaded because the pressure drop  through the oil cooler could become too great due to denting  or clogging of the cooler tubing. In such a case, the valve  opens, bypassing the oil around the cooler.  

# Air-Oil Coolers  

Two basic types of oil coolers in general use are the air-cooled  and the fuel-cooled. Air-oil coolers are used in the lubricating  systems of some turbine engines to reduce the temperature  of the oil to a degree suitable for recirculation through the  system. The air-cooled oil cooler is normally installed at  the forward end of the engine. It is similar in construction  and operation to the air-cooled cooler used on reciprocating  engines. An air-oil cooler is usually included in a dry-sump  oil system.  [Figure 6-42]  This cooler may be air-cooled or  fuel-cooled and many engines use both. Dry-sump lubrication  systems require coolers for several reasons. First, air cooling  of bearings by using compressor bleed-air is not sufficient to  cool the turbine bearing cavities because of the heat present  in area of the turbine bearings. Second, the large turbofan  engines normally require a greater number of bearings, which  means that more heat is transferred to the oil. Consequently,  the oil coolers are the only means of dissipating the oil heat.  

# Fuel-Oil Coolers  

The fuel-cooled oil cooler acts as a fuel-oil heat exchanger  in that the fuel cools the hot oil and the oil heats the fuel  for combustion.  [Figure 6-43]  Fuel flowing to the engine  must pass through the heat exchanger; however, there is a  thermostatic valve that controls the oil flow, and the oil may  bypass the cooler if no cooling is needed. The fuel-oil heat  

![](images/9593324d2057e3297e7a9d161f0822142ee6d97f6471266cf3ec4015486b258d.jpg)  
Figure 6-43.  Fuel-oil heat exchanger cooler.  

exchanger consists of a series of joined tubes with an inlet  and outlet port. The oil enters the inlet port, moves around  the fuel tubes, and goes out the oil outlet port.  

# Deoiler  

The deoiler removes the oil from the breather air. The breather  air goes into an impeller that turns in the deoiler housing.  Centrifugal force drives the oil towards the outer wall of the  impeller. Then, the oil drains from the deoiler into a sump or  oil tank. Because the air is much lighter than the oil, it goes  through the center of the impeller and is vented overboard.  

# Magnetic Chip Detectors  

Magnetic chip detectors are used in the oil system to detect  and catch ferrous (magnetic) particles present in the oil.  [Figure 6-44]  Scavenge oil generally flows past chip detectors  so any magnetic particles are attracted and stick to the chip  detector. Chip detectors are placed in several locations but  generally are in the scavenge lines for each scavenge pump,  oil tank, and in the oil sumps. Some engines have several  detectors to one detector. During maintenance, the chip  detectors are removed from the engine and inspected for  metal; if none is found, the detector is cleaned, replaced,  and safety wired. If metal is found on a chip detector, an  investigation should be made to find the source of the metal  on the chip.  

# Typical Dry-Sump Pressure Regulated  Turbine Lubrication System  

The turbine lubrication system is representative of turbine  engines using a dry-sump system.  [Figure 6-45]  The  lubrication system is a pressure regulated, high-pressure  design. It consists of the pressure, scavenge, and breather  subsystems.  

The pressure system supplies oil to the main engine bearings  and to the accessory drives. The scavenger system returns  the oil to the engine oil tank that is usually mounted on  

![](images/6b9cfb25aae448c7d7bcd549023e16362a558aa58e6667b0f4a31e9328db2205.jpg)  
Figure 6-44.  Chip detector.  

the compressor case. It is connected to the inlet side of the  pressure oil pump and completes the oil flow cycle. A breather  system connecting the individual bearing compartments and  the oil tank with the breather pressurizing valve completes  the engine lubrication system. In a turbine pressure relief  dry-sump lubrication system, the oil supply is carried in a  tank mounted on the engine. With this type of system, a larger  oil supply can be carried, and the temperature of the oil can  be readily controlled.  

# Pressure System  

The oil pressure branch of the engine lubrication system  is pressurized by a gear-type pressure pump located in the  oil pump and accessory drive housing.  [Figure 6-45]  The  pressure pump receives engine oil at its lower (inlet) side  and discharges pressurized oil to an oil filter located on the  housing. From the oil filter, which is equipped with a bypass  valve for operation in case the filter clogs, the pressurized  oil is transmitted to a cored passage running through to the  pressure regulating (relief) valve that maintains system  pressure. The pressure regulating (relief) valve is located  downstream of the pump. It is adjusted to maintain a proper  pressure to the oil metering jets in the engine. The pressure  regulating (relief) valve is usually easily accessible for  adjustment. Then, the oil flows through the fuel-oil cooler and  on to the bearing cavities through last-chance filters and out  spray nozzles to the bearings. Pressurized oil distributed to  the engine main bearings is sprayed on the bearings through  fixed orifice nozzles providing a relatively constant oil flow  at all engine operating speeds.  

# Scavenge System  

The scavenge system scavenges the main bearing  compartments and circulates the scavenged oil back to  the tank. The scavenge oil system includes five gear-type  pumps.  [Figure 6-45]  The No.1 bearing oil scavenge  pump scavenges accumulated oil from the front bearing  case. It directs the oil through an external line to a  central collecting point in the main accessory gearbox.  The oil return from No. 2 and 3 bearings is through  internal passages to a central collecting point in the main  accessory case. The accessory gearbox oil suction pump,  located in the main accessory gearbox, scavenges oil from  the gearbox housing to the oil tank. Oil from the No. 4, No.   $4\%$   and No. 5 bearing accumulates in the bearing cavity and  is scavenged to the accessory gearbox.  

The turbine rear bearing oil suction pump scavenges oil from  the No. 6 bearing compartment and directs the scavenged oil  through a passage in the turbine case strut. From there, it is  directed to the bearing cavity for the 4,  $4\%$  , and 5 bearing  cavities where it joins the oil and is returned to the oil tank.  The scavenge oil passes through the deaerator as it enters the  

![](images/2c45ba41cfabe1d082306d824155127eba7a7e1833ca9f4fc9bd975a643720bf.jpg)  
Figure 6-45.  Typical turbine dry-sump pressure regulated lubrication system.  

oil tank, which separates the air mixed in the return oil. The  oil stays in the tank while the air flows into the accessory  gearbox and enters the deoiler.  

# Breather Pressurizing System  

The breather pressurizing system ensures a proper oil  spray pattern from the main bearing oil jets and furnishes a  pressure head to the scavenge system. Breather tubes in the  compressor inlet case, the oil tank, the diffuser case, and the  turbine exhaust case are connected to external tubing at the  top of the engine. By means of this tubing, the vapor-laden  atmospheres of the various bearing compartments and the  oil tank are brought together in the deoiler in the accessory  gearbox. The deoiler separates out the oil from the air-oil  mist and vents the air back to the atmosphere.  

# Typical Dry-Sump Variable Pressure  Lubrication System  

The dry-sump variable-pressure lubrication system uses  the same basic subsystems that the regulated systems use  (pressure Scavenge breather).  [Figure 6-46]  The main  difference is that the pressure in this system is not regulated  by a regulating bypass valve. Most large turbofan engine  pressure systems are variable-pressure systems in which the  pump outlet pressure (oil pressure) depends on the engine  rpm. In other words, the pump output pressure is proportional  to the engine speed. Since the resistance to flow in the system  does not vary much during operation and the pump has only  the variable of turning faster or slower, the pressure is a  function of engine speed. As an example, oil pressure can  vary widely in this type of system, from 100 psi to over 260  psi, with the relief valve opening at about 540 psi.  

# Pressure Subsystem  

The oil flows from the oil tank down to the pressure stage  of the oil pump. A slight pressure in the tank assures that the  flow of oil into the pressure pump is continuous. After being  pressurized, it moves on to the oil filter where it is filtered.  If the filter is clogged, the bypass valve sends the oil around  the filter. There is no regulating valve but there is a relief  valve to prevent the system pressure from exceeding the  maximum limits. This valve is usually set to open well above  the system’s operating pressure. The oil flows from the filter  housing to the engine air-oil cooler. The oil either bypasses  the cooler (cold) or passes through the cooler (hot) and then  on to the fuel-oil cooler. Through the use of the coolers, the  fuel temperature is adjusted to meet the requirements needed  for the engine. Some of the oil passes through the classified  

![](images/4e41b58bfb2031c7499d53a606e012f0f13c09458c8f3e8e2a7bf9f367252b8a.jpg)  
Figure 6-46.  Typical turbine dry-sump variable pressure lubrication system.  

oil pressure trim orifice that helps adjust oil pressure at low  speeds. The oil now flows through the last-chance oil filters  (strainers) that remove particles from the oil if the oil filter has  been bypassed. The engine oil passes through the nozzles to  lubricate the bearings, gearboxes, seals, and accessory drive  splines. After performing its functions of lubricating, cleaning,  and cooling the bearings, the oil needs to be returned to the  old tank by the scavenge system.  

# Scavenger Subsystem  

The scavenger oil pump has several stages that pull oil from  the bearing compartments and gearboxes and sends the oil  to the tank. At the tank, the oil enters the deaerator, which  separates the air from the scavenge oil. The oil returns to the  tank and the air is vented through a check valve overboard.  Each stage of the scavenge pump has a magnetic chip detector  that can be removed for inspection.  

# Breather Subsystem  

The purpose of the breather system is to remove air from the  bearing compartments, separate breather air from oil, and  vent the air overboard. The breather air from the bearing  compartments is drawn to the gearbox by the deoiler.  The deoiler is turned at high speed and causes the oil to  separate from the air. The air is then vented with air from  the deaerator overboard. By referring to  Figure  $_{6-46}$  , notice  that the deaerator is in the oil tank and the deoiler is in the  main gearbox.  

# Turbine Engine Wet-Sump Lubrication  System  

In some engines, the lubrication system is the wet-sump type.  There are relatively few engines using a wet-sump type of oil  system. The components of a wet-sump system are similar to  those of a dry-sump system. The major difference between the  two systems is the location of the oil reservoir. The reservoir  for the wet-sump oil system may be the accessory gear case  or it may be a sump mounted on the bottom of the accessory  case. Regardless of configuration, reservoirs for wet-sump  systems are an integral part of the engine and contain the  bulk of the engine oil supply.  [Figure 6-47]  

Included in the wet-sump reservoir are the following  components:  

1.	 A sight gauge indicates the oil level in the sump.  2.	 A vent or breather equalizes pressure within the  accessory casing.  

![](images/59f3bdedce099925ff7a734c3bd60624213101e800735efaf9ef1b3282716f22.jpg)  
Figure 6-47.  Typical turbine wet-sump system.  

3.	 A magnetic drain plug may be provided to drain the  oil and also to trap any ferrous metal particles in the  oil. This plug should always be examined closely  during inspections. The presence of metal particles  may indicate gear or bearing failure. 4.	 Provision may also be made for a temperature bulb  and an oil pressure fitting.  

This system is typical of all engines using a wet-sump  lubrication system. The bearing and drive gears in the  accessory drive casing are lubricated by a splash system. The  oil for the remaining points of lubrication leaves the pump  under pressure and passes through a filter to jet nozzles that  direct the oil into the rotor bearings and couplings. The oil  is returned to the reservoir (sump) by gravity. Oil from the  compressor bearing and the accessories drive coupling shaft  drains directly into the reservoir. Turbine oil drains into a  sump where the oil was originally pumped.  

# Turbine Engine Oil System Maintenance  

Maintenance of gas turbine lubrication systems consists  mainly of adjusting, removing, cleaning, and replacing  various components. Oil filter maintenance and oil change  intervals for turbine engines vary widely from model to  model, depending on the severity of the oil temperature  conditions imposed by the specific airframe installation  and engine configuration. The applicable manufacturer’s  instructions should be followed. The oil filter should  be removed at every regular inspection. It should be  disassembled, cleaned, and any worn or damaged filter  elements replaced. The following steps illustrate typical oil  filter removal cleaning and replacement procedures:  

1.	 Provide a suitable container for collecting the drained  oil, if needed.  

![](images/eee52e70d61d4798f02a761dd6ec0056e09b50850c2a41cd3dbb601e34323f13.jpg)  
Figure 6-48.  Oil filter housing.  

2.	 Remove the filter housing and withdraw the filter  assembly.  [Figure 6-48]  Discard the old seals. 3.	 Immerse the screen or filter in an approved carbon  remover at room temperature for a few minutes. Rinse  them in a degreaser fluid or cleaning solvent. Then,  blow them dry with an air jet. 4.	 Then, install the filter in the filter housing assembly.  Place a new seal and tighten it to the torque prescribed  in the manufacturer’s instructions.  5.	 Secure with lock wire.  

To adjust the oil pressure, first remove the adjusting screw  acorn cap on the oil pressure relief valve. Then, loosen the  locknut and turn the adjusting screw clockwise to increase,  or counterclockwise to decrease, the oil pressure. In a typical  turbojet lubrication system, the adjusting screw is adjusted  to provide an oil pressure of 45,   $\pm5$   psi, at approximately  75 percent of normal rated thrust. The adjustment should  be made while the engine is idling; it may be necessary to  perform several adjustments before the desired pressure  is obtained. When the proper pressure setting is achieved,  tighten the adjusting screw locknut, and install the acorn cap  with a new gasket, then tighten and secure with lock wire.  

Checking or servicing aircraft engine oil is an important  maintenance function. Before servicing any aircraft engine,  consult the specific aircraft maintenance manual to determine  the proper type of servicing equipment and procedures. In  general, aircraft engine oil is checked with a dipstick or a  sight gauge. There are markings on the stick or around the  sight gauge to determine the correct level.  Turbine engines  must be checked just after shutdown.  

Maintenance of scavenge and breather systems at regular  inspections includes checks for oil leaks and security of  mounting of system components. Also, check chip detectors  for particles of ferrous material and clean last-chance filters;  install and safety.  

# Engine Cooling Systems  

Excessive heat is always undesirable in both reciprocating  and turbine aircraft engines. If means were not available  for its control or elimination, major damage or complete  engine failure would occur. Although the vast majority of  reciprocating engines are air cooled, some diesel liquid- cooled engines are being made available for light aircraft.  [Figure 6-49]  In a liquid-cooled engine, around the cylinder  are water jackets, in which liquid coolant is circulated and  the coolant takes away the excess heat. The excess heat is  then dissipated by a heat exchanger or radiator using air flow.  Turbine engines use secondary airflow to cool the inside  components and many of the exterior components.  

# Reciprocating Engine Cooling Systems  

An internal-combustion engine is a heat machine that  converts chemical energy in the fuel into mechanical energy  at the crankshaft. It does not do this without some loss of  energy, however, and even the most efficient aircraft engines  may waste 60 to 70 percent of the original energy in the  fuel. Unless most of this waste heat is rapidly removed,  the cylinders may become hot enough to cause complete  engine failure. Excessive heat is undesirable in any internal- combustion engine for three principal reasons:  

1.	 It affects the behavior of the combustion of the air-fuel  charge. 2.	 It weakens and shortens the life of engine parts. 3.	 It impairs lubrication.  

If the temperature inside the engine cylinder is too great,  the air-fuel mixture is preheated, and combustion occurs  before the desired time. Since premature combustion causes  

![](images/b3ae4d2a11a8a95b729ec52efad7c6dff69d199987c1cea3c935c63aa267b71e.jpg)  
Figure 6-49.  Diesel liquid-cooled aircraft engine.  

detonation, knocking, and other undesirable conditions, there  must be a way to eliminate heat before it causes damage.  

One gallon of aviation gasoline has enough heat value to  boil 75 gallons of water; thus, it is easy to see that an engine  that burns 4 gallons of fuel per minute releases a tremendous  amount of heat. About one-fourth of the heat released is  changed into useful power. The remainder of the heat must  be dissipated so that it is not destructive to the engine. In a  typical aircraft powerplant, half of the heat goes out with the  exhaust and the other is absorbed by the engine. Circulating  oil picks up part of this soaked-in heat and transfers it to the  airstream through the oil cooler. The engine cooling system  takes care of the rest. Cooling is a matter of transferring the  excess heat from the cylinders to the air, but there is more  to such a job than just placing the cylinders in the airstream.  A cylinder on a large engine is roughly the size of a gallon  jug. Its outer surface, however, is increased by the use of  cooling fins so that it presents a barrel-sized exterior to the  cooling air. Such an arrangement increases the heat transfer  by convection. If too much of the cooling fin area is broken  off, the cylinder cannot cool properly, and a hotspot develops.  Therefore, cylinders are normally replaced if a specified  number of square inches of fins are missing.  

Cowling and baffles are designed to force air over the  cylinder cooling fins.  [Figure 6-50]  The baffles direct the  air close around the cylinders and prevent it from forming  hot pools of stagnant air while the main streams rush by  unused. Blast tubes are built into the baffles to direct jets of  cooling air onto the rear spark plug elbows of each cylinder  to prevent overheating of ignition leads. Blast tubes also  provide cooling to engine accessories such as alternators,  generators, and starters.  

![](images/e39a688feef9dacdae80787a6cdbf66d3e7217cc8710000d8e18ae02f243eeeb.jpg)  
Figure 6-50.  Cylinder baffle and deflector system.  

An engine can have an operating temperature that is too low.  For the same reasons that an engine is warmed up before  takeoff, it is kept warm during flight. Fuel evaporation and  distribution and oil circulation depend on an engine being  kept at its optimum operating temperature. The aircraft engine  has temperature controls that regulate air circulation over  the engine. Unless some controls are provided, the engine  could overheat on takeoff and get too cold in high altitude,  high-speed and low-power letdowns.  

The most common means of controlling cooling is the use of  cowl flaps.  [Figure 6-51]  These flaps are opened and closed  by electric motor-driven jackscrews, by hydraulic actuators,  or manually in some light aircraft. When extended for  increased cooling, the cowl flaps produce drag and sacrifice  streamlining for the added cooling. On takeoff, the cowl flaps  are opened only enough to keep the engine below the red-line  temperature. Heating above the normal range is allowed so  that drag is as low as possible. During ground operations, the  cowl flaps should be opened wide since drag does not matter  and cooling needs to be set at maximum. Cowl flaps are used  mostly with older aircraft and radial engine installations.  

![](images/32b03581902d9e29d0b9fae9a4ebfc41f41b132a9e29f2bdc60c5db986855a75.jpg)  
Figure 6-51.  Regulating the cooling airflow.  

Some aircraft use augmentors to provide additional cooling  airflow.  [Figure 6-52]  Each nacelle has two pairs of tubes  running from the engine compartment to the rear of the  nacelle. The exhaust collectors feed exhaust gas into the inner  augmentor tubes. The exhaust gas mixes with air that has  passed over the engine and heats it to form a high-temperature,  low-pressure, jet-like exhaust. This low-pressure area in the  augmentors draws additional cooling air over the engine. Air  entering the outer shells of the augmentors is heated through  contact with the augmentor tubes but is not contaminated with  exhaust gases. The heated air from the shell goes to the cabin  heating, defrosting, and anti-icing system.  

Augmentors use exhaust gas velocity to cause airflow over  the engine so that cooling is not entirely dependent on the  prop wash. Vanes installed in the augmentors control the  volume of air. These vanes are usually left in the trail position  to permit maximum flow. They can be closed to increase the  heat for cabin or anti-icing use or to prevent the engine from  cooling too much during descent from altitude. In addition to  augmentors, some aircraft have residual heat doors or nacelle  flaps that are used mainly to let the retained heat escape after
  engine shutdown. The nacelle flaps can be opened for more  cooling than that provided by the augmentors. A modified  form of the previously described augmentor cooling system  is used on some light aircraft.  [Figure 6-53]  Augmentor  systems are not used much on modern aircraft.  

As shown in  Figure 6-53 , the engine is pressure cooled by  air taken in through two openings in the nose cowling, one  on each side of the propeller spinner. A pressure chamber is  sealed off on the top side of the engine with baffles properly  directing the flow of cooling air to all parts of the engine  compartment. Warm air is drawn from the lower part of the  engine compartment by the pumping action of the exhaust  

![](images/f57ddb43336627944daa0da2e7a463045019d84e420c9818a8dfb8ef75830d1a.jpg)

gases through the exhaust ejectors. This type of cooling  system eliminates the use of controllable cowl flaps and  assures adequate engine cooling at all operating speeds.  

# Reciprocating Engine Cooling System Maintenance  

The engine cooling system of most reciprocating engines  usually consists of the engine cowling, cylinder baffles,  cylinder fins, and some use a type of cowl flaps. In addition to  these major units, there are also some temperature-indicating  systems, such as cylinder head temperature, oil temperature,  and exhaust gas temperature.  

The cowling performs two functions:  

1.	 It streamlines the bulky engine to reduce drag. 2.	 It forms an envelope around the engine that forces air  to pass around and between the cylinders, absorbing  the heat dissipated by the cylinder fins.  

The cylinder bases are metal shields, designed and arranged  to direct the flow of air evenly around all cylinders. This even  distribution of air aids in preventing one or more cylinders  from being excessively hotter than the others. The cylinder  fins radiate heat from the cylinder walls and heads. As the  air passes over the fins, it absorbs this heat, carries it away  from the cylinder, and is exhausted overboard through the  bottom rear of the cowl.  

The controllable cowl flaps provide a means of decreasing  or increasing the exit area at the rear of the engine cowling.  [Figure 6-54]  Closing the cowl flaps decreases the exit  area, which effectively decreases the amount of air that can  circulate over the cylinder fins. The decreased airflow cannot  carry away as much heat; therefore, it has a tendency for the  engine temperature to increase. Opening the cowl flaps makes  the exit area larger. The flow of cooling air over the cylinders increases, absorbing more heat and the engine temperature  tends to decrease. Good inspection and maintenance in the  care of the engine cooling system aids in overall efficient  and economical engine operation.  

# Maintenance of Engine Cowling  

Of the total ram airflow approaching the airborne engine  nacelle, only about 15 to 30 percent enters the cowling to  provide engine cooling. The remaining air flows over the  outside of the cowling. Therefore, the external shape of the  cowl must be faired in a manner that permits the air to flow  smoothly over the cowl with a minimum loss of energy.  

![](images/f47a5857569e9a3b0912454ea25ca7c2568f49c6c5dce47f89e20506c9cb976c.jpg)  
Figure 6-54.  Small aircraft cowl flaps.

Figure 6-55.  Differential air cooling.  

The engine cowling discussed in this section is typical of  that used on many radial or horizontally opposed engines.  All cooling systems function in the same manner, with minor  engineering changes designed for specific installations.  

The cowl is manufactured in removable sections, the number  varies with the aircraft make and model. The installation  shown in  Figure 6-55  contains two sections that are locked  together when installed.  

The cowl panels, made from sheet aluminum or composite  material, have a smooth external surface to permit  undisturbed airflow over the cowl. The internal construction  is designed to give strength to the panel and, in addition, to  provide receptacles for the toggle latches, cowl support, and  engine air seal.  

An air seal is constructed of rubber material, bolted to a  metal rib riveted to the cowl panel.  [Figure 6-55]  This seal,  as the name implies, seals the air in the engine section,  preventing the air from escaping along the inner surface  of the panel without circulating around the cylinders. The  engine air seal must be used on engines that have a complete  cylinder baffling system that covers the cylinder heads. Its  purpose is to force the air to circulate around and through the  baffle system. Inspect the cowl panels during each regular  engine and aircraft inspection. Removing the cowling for  maintenance provides an opportunity for a more detailed  inspection of the cowling.  

Inspect the cowling panels for scratches, dents, and tears  in the panels. This type of damage causes weakness of the  panel structure, increases drag by disrupting airflow, and  contributes to the starting of corrosion. The cowling panel  latches should be inspected for pulled rivets and loose or  damaged handles. The internal construction of the panel  should be examined to see that the reinforcing ribs are not  cracked and that the air seal is not damaged. The cowl flap  hinges, if equipped, and cowl flap hinge bondings should be  checked for security of mounting and for breaks or cracks.  These inspections are visual checks and should be performed  frequently to ensure that the cowling is serviceable and is  contributing to efficient engine cooling.  

# Engine Cylinder Cooling Fin Inspection  

The cooling fins are of the utmost importance to the  cooling system, since they provide a means of transferring  the cylinder heat to the air. Their condition can mean the  difference between adequate or inadequate cylinder cooling.  The fins are inspected at each regular inspection. Fin area  is the total area (both sides of the fin) exposed to the air.  During the inspection, the fins should be examined for  cracks and breaks.  [Figure 6-56]  Small cracks are not a  

![](images/d8b9e53684bebd540d42644319e7ecf6aba2615624247b8cabb351dfff80cd91.jpg)  
Figure 6-56.  A cylinder head and fins.  

reason for cylinder removal. These cracks can be filled or  even sometimes stop-drilled to prevent any further cracking.  Rough or sharp corners on fins can be smoothed out by  filing, and this action eliminates a possible source of new  cracks. However, before reprofiling cylinder cooling fins,  consult the manufacturer’s service or overhaul manual for  the allowable limits.  

The definition of fin area becomes important in the  examination of fins for broken areas. It is a determining  factor for cylinder acceptance or removal. For example, on a certain engine, if more than 12 inches in length of any one  fin, as measured at its base, is completely broken off, or if  the total fins broken on any one cylinder head exceed 83  square inches of area, the cylinder is removed and replaced.  The reason for removal in this case is that an area of that size  would cause a hot spot on the cylinder; since very little heat  transfer could occur.  

Where adjacent fins are broken in the same area, the total  length of breakage permissible is six inches on any two  adjacent fins, four inches on any three adjacent fins, two  inches on any four adjacent fins, and one inch on any five  adjacent fins. If the breakage length in adjacent fins exceeds  this prescribed amount, the cylinder should be removed and  replaced. These breakage specifications are applicable only  to the engine used in this discussion as a typical example.  In each specific case, applicable manufacturer’s instructions  should be consulted.  

# Cylinder Baffle & Deflector System Inspection  

Reciprocating engines use some type of intercylinder and  cylinder head baffles to force the cooling air into close  contact with all parts of the cylinders.  Figure 6-50  shows a  baffle and deflector system around a cylinder. The air baffle

blocks the flow of air and forces it to circulate between the  cylinder and the deflectors.  Figure 6-57  illustrates a baffle  and deflector arrangement designed to cool the cylinder  head. The air baffle prevents the air from passing away  from the cylinder head and forces it to go between the head  and deflector. Although the resistance offered by baffles to  the passage of the cooling air demands that an appreciable  pressure differential be maintained across the engine to obtain  the necessary airflow, the volume of cooling air required is  greatly reduced by employing properly designed and located  cylinder deflectors.  

As shown in  Figure 6-55 , the airflow approaches the nacelle  and piles up at the top of the engine, creating a high pressure  in the top of the cylinders. This piling up of the air reduces  the air velocity. The outlet at the bottom rear of the cowling  produces a low-pressure area. As the air nears the cowl exit, it  is speeded up again and merges smoothly with the airstream.  The pressure differential between the top and the bottom of the  engine forces the air past the cylinders through the passages  formed by the deflectors. The baffles and deflectors normally  are inspected during the regular engine inspection, but they  should be checked whenever the cowling is removed for any  purpose. Checks should be made for cracks, dents, or loose  hold down studs. Cracks or dents, if severe enough, would  necessitate repair or removal and replacement of these units.  However, a crack that has just started can be stop-drilled, and  dents can be straightened, permitting further service from  these baffles and deflectors.  

# Cylinder Temperature Indicating Systems  

This system usually consists of an indicator, electrical wiring,  and a thermocouple. The wiring is between the instrument  and the nacelle firewall. At the firewall, one end of the  thermocouple leads connects to the electrical wiring, and the  other end of the thermocouple leads connects to the cylinder.  The thermocouple consists of two dissimilar metals, generally  constantan and iron, connected by wiring to an indicating  system. If the temperature of the junction is different from  the temperature where the dissimilar metals are connected  to wires, a voltage is produced. This voltage sends a current  through wires to the indicator, a current-measuring instrument

graduated in degrees.  

The thermocouple end that connects to the cylinder is either  the bayonet or gasket type. To install the bayonet type, the  knurled nut is pushed down and turned clockwise until it is  snug.  [Figure 6-58]  In removing this type, the nut is pushed  down and turned counterclockwise until released. The gasket  type fits under the spark plug and replaces the normal spark  plug gasket.  [Figure 6-59]  When installing a thermocouple  lead, remember not to cut off the lead because it is too long,  but coil and tie up the excess length. The thermocouple is  designed to produce a given amount of resistance. If the  length of the lead is reduced, an incorrect temperature reading  results. The bayonet or gasket of the thermocouple is inserted  or installed on the hottest cylinder of the engine, as determined  in the block test. When the thermocouple is installed and the  wiring connected to the instrument, the indicated reading is the  cylinder temperature. Prior to operating the engine, provided  it is at ambient temperature, the cylinder head temperature  indicator indicates the free outside air temperature; that is one  test for determining that the instrument is working correctly.  The cover glass of the cylinder head temperature indicator  should be checked regularly to see that it has not slipped or  cracked. The cover glass should be checked for indications  of missing or damaged decals that indicate temperature  limitations. If the thermocouple leads were excessive in length  and had to be coiled and tied down, the tie should be inspected  for security or chafing of the wire. The bayonet or gasket  should be inspected for cleanness and security of mounting.  When operating the engine, all of the electrical connections  should be checked if the cylinder head temperature pointer  fluctuates.  

# Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicating Systems  

The exhaust gas temperature indicator consists of a  thermocouple placed in the exhaust stream just after the  cylinder port.  [Figure 6-60]  It is then connected to the  instrument in the instrument panel. This allows for the  adjustment of the mixture, which has a large effect on engine  temperature. By using this instrument to set the mixture, the  engine temperature can be controlled and monitored.  

# Turbine Engine Cooling  

The intense heat generated when fuel and air are burned  necessitates that some means of cooling be provided for  all internal combustion engines. Reciprocating engines are  cooled either by passing air over fins attached to the cylinders  or by passing a liquid coolant through jackets that surround  the cylinders. The cooling problem is made easier because  combustion occurs only during every fourth stroke of a four- stroke-cycle engine.  

The burning process in a gas turbine engine is continuous, and  nearly all of the cooling air must be passed through the inside  of the engine. If only enough air were admitted to the engine  to provide an ideal air-fuel ratio of 15:1, internal temperatures  would increase to more than   $4{,}000\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . In practice, a large  amount of air in excess of the ideal ratio is admitted to the  engine. The large surplus of air cools the hot sections of the  engine to acceptable temperatures ranging from   $1{,}500^{\circ}$   to  

![](images/82aa1859058e7c516ec31b75bed0a6b505a6e87e5199b217037bc30589474811.jpg)  
Figure 6-60.  EGT probe in exhaust stack.  

$2{,}100\,\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  . Because of the effect of cooling, the temperatures  of the outside of the case are considerably less than those  encountered within the engine. The hottest area occurs in and  around the turbines. Although the gases have begun to cool  a little at this point, the conductivity of the metal in the case  carries the heat directly to the outside skin.  

The secondary air passing through the engine cools the  combustion-chamber liners. The liners are constructed to  induce a thin, fast-moving film of air over both the inner  and outer surfaces of the liner. Can-annular-type burners  frequently are provided with a center tube to lead cooling  air into the center of the burner to promote high combustion- efficiency and rapid dilution of the hot combustion gases  while minimizing pressure losses. In all types of gas turbines,  large amounts of relatively cool air join and mix with the  burned gases aft of the burners to cool the hot gases just  before they enter the turbines.  

Cooling-air inlets are frequently provided around the exterior  of the engine to permit the entrance of air to cool the turbine  case, the bearings, and the turbine nozzle. Internal air is  bled from the engine compressor section and is vented to  the bearings and other parts of the engine. Air vented into  or from the engine is ejected into the exhaust stream. When  located on the side of the engine, the case is cooled by outside  air flowing around it. The engine exterior and the engine  nacelle are cooled by passing fan air around the engine and  the nacelle. The engine compartment frequently is divided  into two sections. The forward section is referred to as the  cold section and the aft section (turbine) is referred to as the  hot section. Case drains drain potential leaks overboard to  prevent fluids from building up in the nacelle.  

# Accessory Zone Cooling  

Turbine powerplants can be divided into primary zones  that are isolated from each other by fireproof bulkheads  and seals. The zones are the fan case compartment,  intermediate compressor case compartment, and the core  engine compartment.  [Figure 6-61]  Calibrated airflows are  supplied to the zones to keep the temperatures around the  engine at levels that are acceptable. The airflow provides for  proper ventilation to prevent a buildup of any harmful vapors.  Zone 1, for example, is around the fan case that contains  the accessory case and the electronic engine control (EEC).  This area is vented by using ram air through an inlet in the  nose cowl and is exhausted through a louvered vent in the  right fan cowling.  

If the pressure exceeds a certain limit, a pressure relief door  opens and relieves the pressure. Zone 2 is cooled by fan air  from the upper part of the fan duct and is exhausted at the  lower end back into the fan air stream. This area has both

fuel and oil lines, so removing any unwanted vapors would  be important.  

pre-cooler and other areas and is exhausted from the zone  through the aft edge of the thrust reverser inner wall and the  turbine exhaust sleeve.  

Zone 3 is the area around the high-pressure compressor to  the turbine cases. This zone also contains fuel and oil lines  and other accessories. Air enters from the exhaust of the

Figure 6-62.  Typical engine insulation blanket.  

# Turbine Engine Insulation Blankets  

To reduce the temperature of the structure in the vicinity  of the exhaust duct or thrust augmentor (afterburner) and  to eliminate the possibility of fuel or oil coming in contact  with the hot parts of the engine, it is sometimes necessary  to provide insulation on the exhaust duct of gas turbine  engines. The exhaust duct surface temperature runs quite  high. A typical insulation blanket and the temperatures  obtained at various locations are shown in  Figure 6-62 . This  blanket contains fiberglass as the low conductance material  and aluminum foil as the radiation shield. The blanket is  suitably covered so that it does not become oil soaked.  Insulation blankets have been used rather extensively on  many installations in which long exhaust is needed. Some  auxiliary power units (APU) mounted in the tail cone of  transport aircraft have air that surrounds the exhaust tail pipe  that provides cooling and protects the surrounding structure.  

# Chapter 7 Propellers  

# General  

The propeller, the unit that must absorb the power output of  the engine, has passed through many stages of development.  Although most propellers are two-bladed, great increases  in power output have resulted in the development of four-  and six-bladed propellers of large diameters. However, all  propeller-driven aircraft are limited by the revolutions per  minute (rpm) at which propellers can be turned.  

There are several forces acting on the propeller as it turns; a  major one is centrifugal force. This force at high rpm tends  to pull the blades out of the hub, so blade weight is very  important to the design of a propeller. Excessive blade tip  speed (rotating the propeller too fast) may result not only in  poor blade efficiency, but also in fluttering and vibration.  Since the propeller speed is limited, the aircraft speed of a  propeller driven aircraft is also limited—to approximately  400 miles per hour (mph). As aircraft speeds increased,  turbofan engines were used for higher speed aircraft.  Propeller-driven aircraft have several advantages and are  widely used for applications in turboprops and reciprocating  engine installations. Takeoff and landing can be shorter and  less expensive. New blade materials and manufacturing  techniques have increased the efficiency of propellers.  Many smaller aircraft will continue to use propellers well  into the future.  

The basic nomenclature of the parts of a propeller is shown  in  Figure 7-1  for a simple fixed-pitch, two-bladed wood  propeller. The aerodynamic cross-section of a blade in  Figure 7-2  includes terminology to describe certain areas  shown.  

Many different types of propeller systems have been  developed for specific aircraft installation, speed, and  mission. Propeller development has encouraged many  

![](images/5c72b2161135720b963d804864c992c8d96d4e5cc5e555d286663992b31f5611.jpg)

changes as propulsion systems have evolved. The first  propellers were fabric-covered sticks made to force air  in a rearward direction. Propellers started as simple two- bladed wood propellers and have advanced to the complex  propulsion systems of turboprop aircraft that involve more  than just the propeller. As an outgrowth of operating large,  more complex propellers, a variable-pitch, constant-speed  feathering and reversing propeller system was developed.  This system allows the engine rpm to be varied only slightly  during different flight conditions and, therefore, increases  flying efficiency. A basic constant-speed system consists of a  flyweight-equipped governor unit that controls the pitch angle  of the blades so that the engine speed remains constant. The  governor can be regulated by controls in the flight deck so that  any desired blade angle setting and engine operating speed  can be obtained. A low-pitch, high-rpm setting, for example,  can be utilized for takeoff. Then, after the aircraft is airborne,  a higher pitch and lower rpm setting can be used.  Figure 7-3 shows normal propeller movement with the positions of low  pitch, high pitch, feather (used if the engine quits to reduce  drag), and zero pitch into negative pitch, or reverse pitch.  

# Basic Propeller Principles  

The aircraft propeller consists of two or more blades and a  central hub to which the blades are attached. Each blade of

Typical propeller blade positions from feather position through the reverse position. Normal sequence of blade  travel is feather, high pitch, low pitch, locks/ground idle, reverse pitch, and then back following the same path.  Fixed turboprop engines are shut down on the locks to prevent load on the engine during restart.  

an aircraft propeller is essentially a rotating wing. As a result  of their construction, the propeller blades produce forces  that create thrust to pull or push the aircraft through the air. The power needed to rotate the propeller blades is furnished  by the engine. The propeller is mounted on a shaft, which may  be an extension of the crankshaft on low-horsepower engines;  on high-horsepower engines, it is mounted on a propeller  shaft that is geared to the engine crankshaft. In either case,  the engine rotates the airfoils of the blades through the air at  high speeds, and the propeller transforms the rotary power  of the engine into thrust.  

# Propeller Aerodynamic Process  

An aircraft moving through the air creates a drag force  opposing its forward motion. If an aircraft is to fly on a  level path, there must be a force applied to it that is equal to  the drag but acting forward. This force is called thrust. The  work done by thrust is equal to the thrust times the distance  it moves the aircraft.  

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{Work}=\mathrm{Thurst}\times\mathrm{Distance}}
$$  

The power expended by thrust is equal to the thrust times the  velocity at which it moves the aircraft.  

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{Power}=\mathrm{Thurs}\times\mathrm{Volocity}}
$$  

If the power is measured in horsepower units, the power  expended by the thrust is termed thrust horsepower.  

The engine supplies brake horsepower through a rotating  shaft, and the propeller converts it into thrust horsepower.  In this conversion, some power is wasted. For maximum  efficiency, the propeller must be designed to keep this waste  as small as possible. Since the efficiency of any machine  is the ratio of the useful power output to the power input,  propeller efficiency is the ratio of thrust horsepower to brake  horsepower. The usual symbol for propeller efficiency is the  Greek letter η (eta). Propeller efficiency varies from 50 percent  to 87 percent, depending on how much the propeller slips.  

Pitch is not the same as blade angle, but because pitch is  largely determined by blade angle, the two terms are often  used interchangeably. An increase or decrease in one is usually  associated with an increase or decrease in the other. Propeller  slip is the difference between the geometric pitch of the  propeller and its effective pitch.  [Figure 7-4]  Geometric pitch  is the distance a propeller should advance in one revolution  with no slippage; effective pitch is the distance it actually  advances. Thus, geometric or theoretical pitch is based on  no slippage. Actual, or effective, pitch recognizes propeller  slippage in the air. The relationship can be shown as:  

$$
\boxed{\mathrm{Geominus\pitch-Effective\ p i t c h=s l i p}}
$$  

Geometric pitch is usually expressed in pitch inches and  calculated by using the following formula:  

$\operatorname{GP}\,{=}\,2\,\mathsf{X}\,\pi\,\mathsf{X}\,\mathsf{R}\,\mathsf{X}$   tangent of blade angle at 75 percent station  $\mathtt{R}=$    Radius at the 75 percent blade station  

$$
\pi=3.14
$$  

Although blade angle and propeller pitch are closely related,  blade angle is the angle between the face or chord of a  blade section and the plane in which the propeller rotates.  

![](images/46767d8ef375e3c70d4c53f41041ca134546eea88c3aba2d007d94d8b31b3548.jpg)  
Figure 7-4.   Effective pitch and geometric pitch.  

[Figure 7-5]  Blade angle, usually measured in degrees, is  the angle between the chordline of the blade and the plane of  rotation. The chordline of the propeller blade is determined  in about the same manner as the chordline of an airfoil. In  fact, a propeller blade can be considered as being composed  of an infinite number of thin blade elements, each of which  is a miniature airfoil section whose chord is the width of the  propeller blade at that section. Because most propellers have  a flat blade face, the chordline is often drawn along the face  of the propeller blade.  

The typical propeller blade can be described as a twisted  airfoil of irregular planform. Two views of a propeller blade  are shown in  Figure 7-6 . For purposes of analysis, a blade can  be divided into segments that are located by station numbers  in inches from the center of the blade hub. The cross-sections  of each 6-inch blade segment are shown as airfoils in the  right side of  Figure 7-6 . Also identified in  Figure 7-6  are the  blade shank and the blade butt. The blade shank is the thick,  rounded portion of the propeller blade near the hub and is  designed to give strength to the blade. The blade butt, also  called the blade base or root, is the end of the blade that fits   in the propeller hub. The blade tip is that part of the propeller  blade farthest from the hub, generally defined as the last 6  inches of the blade.  

A cross-section of a typical propeller blade is shown in  Figure 7-7 . This section or blade element is an airfoil  comparable to a cross-section of an aircraft wing. The blade  back is the cambered or curved side of the blade, similar to  the upper surface of an aircraft wing. The blade face is the  flat side of the propeller blade. The chordline is an imaginary  line drawn through the blade from the leading edge to the  trailing edge. The leading edge is the thick edge of the blade  that meets the air as the propeller rotates.  

A rotating propeller is acted upon by centrifugal twisting,  aerodynamic twisting, torque bending, and thrust bending  forces. The principal forces acting on a rotating propeller  

![](images/bf8e08e7cf85a99c549e4e2b1f2c4c5112aa28c1422b2584f80c0b6f7e3673fa.jpg)

are illustrated in  Figure 7-8 .  

Centrifugal force is a physical force that tends to  throw the rotating propeller blades away from the hub.  [Figure 7-8A]  This is the most dominant force on the  propeller. Torque bending force, in the form of air resistance,  tends to bend the propeller blades in the direction opposite  that of rotation.  [Figure 7-8B]  Thrust bending force is the  thrust load that tends to bend propeller blades forward as the  aircraft is pulled through the air.  [Figure 7-8C]  Aerodynamic  twisting force tends to turn the blades to a high blade angle.  [Figure 7-8D]  Centrifugal twisting force, being greater than  the aerodynamic twisting force, tends to force the blades  toward a low blade angle.  

At least two of these forces acting on the propellers blades  are used to move the blades on a controllable pitch propeller.  Centrifugal twisting force is sometimes used to move the  blades to the low pitch position, while aerodynamic twisting  force is used to move the blades into high pitch. These forces  can be the primary or secondary forces that move the blades  to the new pitch position.

Figure 7-8.   Forces acting on a rotating propeller.  

A propeller must be capable of withstanding severe stresses,  which are greater near the hub, caused by centrifugal force and  thrust. The stresses increase in proportion to the rpm. The blade  face is also subjected to tension from the centrifugal force and  additional tension from the bending. For these reasons, nicks or  scratches on the blade may cause very serious consequences.  These could lead to cracks and failure of the blade and are  addressed in the repair section later in this chapter.  

A propeller must also be rigid enough to prevent fluttering,  a type of vibration in which the ends of the blade twist back  and forth at high frequency around an axis perpendicular  to the engine crankshaft. Fluttering is accompanied by a  distinctive noise, often mistaken for exhaust noise. The  constant vibration tends to weaken the blade and eventually  causes failure.  

# Aerodynamic Factors  

To understand the action of a propeller, consider first its  motion, which is both rotational and forward. Thus, as shown  by the vectors of propeller forces in  Figure 7-9,  a section  of a propeller blade moves downward and forward. As far  as the forces are concerned, the result is the same as if the  blade were stationary and the air coming at it from a direction  opposite its path. The angle at which this air (relative wind)  

![](images/50ec33ba660aea06242e19727626c9a097f43e64b999348f38b3d219b0a76e1c.jpg)  
Figure 7-9.   Propeller forces.  

strikes the propeller blade is called angle of attack (AOA).  The air deflection produced by this angle causes the dynamic  pressure at the engine side of the propeller blade to be greater  than atmospheric pressure, creating thrust.  

The shape of the blade also creates thrust because it is  shaped like a wing. As the air flows past the propeller, the  pressure on one side is less than that on the other. As in a  wing, this difference in pressure produces a reaction force  in the direction of the lesser pressure. The area above a wing  has less pressure, and the force (lift) is upward. The area of  decreased pressure is in front of a propeller which is mounted  in a vertical instead of a horizontal position, and the force  (thrust) is in a forward direction. Aerodynamically, thrust is  the result of the propeller shape and the AOA of the blade.  

Another way to consider thrust is in terms of the mass of  air handled. In these terms, thrust is equal to the mass of  air handled multiplied by the slipstream velocity minus  the velocity of the aircraft. Thus, the power expended in  producing thrust depends on the mass of air moved per  second. On the average, thrust constitutes approximately  80 percent of the torque (total horsepower absorbed by  the propeller). The other 20 percent is lost in friction and  slippage. For any speed of rotation, the horsepower absorbed  by the propeller balances the horsepower delivered by  the engine. For any single revolution of the propeller, the  amount of air displaced (moved) depends on the blade angle,  which determines the quantity or amount of mass of air the  propeller moves. Thus, the blade angle is an excellent means  of adjusting the load on the propeller to control the engine  rpm. If the blade angle is increased, more load is placed on the  engine, tending to slow it down unless more power is applied.  As an airfoil is moved through the air, it produces two forces:  lift and drag. Increasing propeller blade angle increases the  AOA and produces more lift and drag; this action increases  the horsepower required to turn the propeller at a given rpm.  Since the engine is still producing the same horsepower, the  propeller slows down. If the blade angle is decreased, the  propeller speeds up. Thus, the engine rpm can be controlled  by increasing or decreasing the blade angle.  

The blade angle is also an excellent method of adjusting the  AOA of the propeller. On constant-speed propellers, the blade  angle must be adjusted to provide the most efficient AOA  at all engine and aircraft speeds. Lift versus drag curves,  which are drawn for propellers as well as wings, indicate  that the most efficient AOA is a small one varying from  $2^{\circ}$    to  $4^{\circ}$   positive. The actual blade angle necessary to maintain  this small AOA varies with the forward speed of the aircraft.  This is due to a change in the relative wind direction, which  varies with aircraft speed.  

Fixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers are designed  for best efficiency at one rotation and forward speed. In other  words, they are designed to fit a given aircraft and engine  combination. A propeller may be used that provides the  maximum propeller efficiency for takeoff, climb, cruising,  or high speeds. Any change in these conditions results in  lowering the efficiency of both the propeller and the engine.  

A constant-speed propeller, however, keeps the blade angle  adjusted for maximum efficiency for most conditions  encountered in flight. During takeoff, when maximum power  and thrust are required, the constant-speed propeller is at a  low propeller blade angle or pitch. The low blade angle keeps  the AOA small and efficient with respect to the relative wind.  At the same time, it allows the propeller to handle a smaller  mass of air per revolution. This light load allows the engine  to turn at high rpm and to convert the maximum amount  of fuel into heat energy in a given time. The high rpm also  creates maximum thrust. Although the mass of air handled  per revolution is small, the engine rpm is high, the slipstream  velocity (air coming off the propeller) is high, and, with the  low aircraft speed, the thrust is maximum.  

After liftoff, as the speed of the aircraft increases, the  constant-speed propeller changes to a higher angle (or pitch).  Again, the higher blade angle keeps the AOA small and  efficient with respect to the relative wind. The higher blade  angle increases the mass of air handled per revolution. This  decreases the engine rpm, reducing fuel consumption and  engine wear, and keeps thrust at a maximum.  

For climb after takeoff, the power output of the engine is  reduced to climb power by decreasing the manifold pressure  and increasing the blade angle to lower the rpm. Thus, the  torque (horsepower absorbed by the propeller) is reduced to  match the reduced power of the engine. The AOA is again  kept small by the increase in blade angle. The greater mass  of air handled per second, in this case, is more than offset by  the lower slipstream velocity and the increase in airspeed.  

At cruising altitude, when the aircraft is in level flight and  less power is required than is used in takeoff or climb, engine  power is again reduced by lowering the manifold pressure  and increasing the blade angle to decrease the rpm. Again,  this reduces torque to match the reduced engine power; for,  although the mass of air handled per revolution is greater, it  is more than offset by a decrease in slipstream velocity and  an increase in airspeed. The AOA is still small because the  blade angle has been increased with an increase in airspeed.  Pitch distribution is the twist in the blade from the shank to  the blade tip, due to the variation in speeds that each section  of the blade is traveling. The tip of the blade is traveling much  faster than the inner portion of the blade.  

# Propeller Controls & Instruments  

Fixed pitch propellers have no controls and require no  adjustments in flight. The constant-speed propeller has a  propeller control in the center pedestal between the throttle  and the mixture control.  [Figure 7-10]  The two positions for  the control are increase rpm (full forward) and decrease rpm   (pulled aft). This control is directly connected to the propeller  governor and, by moving the control, adjusts the tension on  the governor speeder spring. This control can also be used to  feather the propeller in some aircraft by moving the control  to the full decrease rpm position. The two main instruments  used with the constant-speed propeller are the engine  tachometer and the manifold pressure gauge. Rotations per  minute (rpm) is controlled by the propeller control and the  manifold pressure is adjusted by the throttle.  

# Propeller Location  

# Tractor Propeller  

Tractor propellers are those mounted on the upstream end of  a drive shaft in front of the supporting structure. Most aircraft  are equipped with this type of propeller. The tractor type of  propeller comes in all types of propellers. A major advantage  of the tractor propeller is that lower stresses are induced in  the propeller as it rotates in relatively undisturbed air.  

![](images/636d9f518d75a18587f7d5a68ca246651199d957fbf43a4e46a871cde4860375.jpg)  
Figure 7-10.   Turboprop propeller controls.  

# Pusher Propellers  

Pusher propellers are those mounted on the downstream  end of a drive shaft behind the supporting structure. Pusher  propellers are constructed as fixed- or variable-pitch  propellers. Seaplanes and amphibious aircraft have used a  greater percentage of pusher propellers than other kinds of  aircraft. On land aircraft, where propeller-to-ground clearance  usually is less than propeller-to-water clearance of watercraft,  pusher propellers are subject to more damage than tractor  propellers. Rocks, gravel, and small objects dislodged by  the wheels are quite often thrown or drawn into a pusher  propeller. Similarly, aircraft with pusher propellers are apt  to encounter propeller damage from water spray thrown up  by the hull during landing or takeoff airspeed. Consequently,  the pusher propeller is mounted above and behind the wings  to prevent such damage.  

# Types of Propellers  

There are various types or classes of propellers, the simplest  of which are the fixed-pitch and ground-adjustable propellers.  The complexity of propeller systems increases from these  simpler forms to controllable-pitch and complex constant- speed systems (automatic systems). Various characteristics  of several propeller types are discussed in the following  paragraphs, but no attempt is made to cover all types of  propellers.  

# Fixed-Pitch Propeller  

As the name implies, a fixed-pitch propeller has the blade  pitch, or blade angle, built into the propeller.  [Figure 7-11] The blade angle cannot be changed after the propeller is  built. Generally, this type of propeller is one piece and is  constructed of wood or aluminum alloy.  

Fixed-pitch propellers are designed for best efficiency at  one rotational and forward speed. They are designed to fit a  set of conditions of both aircraft and engine speeds and any  change in these conditions reduces the efficiency of both the  propeller and the engine. The fixed-pitch propeller is used on  aircraft of low power, speed, range, or altitude. Many single- engine aircraft use fixed-pitch propellers and the advantages  of these are less expense and their simple operation. This  type of propeller does not require any control inputs from  the pilot in flight.  

# Test Club Propeller  

A test club is used to test and break in reciprocating engines.  [Figure 7-12]  They are made to provide the correct amount  of load on the engine during the test break-in period. The  multi-blade design also provides extra cooling air flow  during testing.

Figure 7-11.   Fixed-pitch propeller.  

# Ground-Adjustable Propeller  

The ground-adjustable propeller operates as a fixed-pitch  propeller. The pitch, or blade angle, can be changed only  when the propeller is not turning. This is done by loosening  the clamping mechanism that holds the blades in place. After  the clamping mechanism has been tightened, the pitch of the  blades cannot be changed in flight to meet variable flight  requirements. The ground-adjustable propeller is not often  used on present-day aircraft.  

# Controllable-Pitch Propeller  

The controllable-pitch propeller permits a change of blade  pitch, or angle, while the propeller is rotating. This allows  

![](images/ecff813e513027e70981dd8a9d296ea8c45a98d0e40442bca9080662692a7392.jpg)

the propeller to assume a blade angle that gives the best  performance for particular flight conditions. The number  of pitch positions may be limited, as with a two-position  controllable propeller, or the pitch may be adjusted to any  angle between the minimum and maximum pitch settings of  a given propeller. The use of controllable-pitch propellers  also makes it possible to attain the desired engine rpm for a  particular flight condition.  

This type of propeller is not to be confused with a constant- speed propeller. With the controllable-pitch type, the blade  angle can be changed in flight, but the pilot must change the  propeller blade angle directly. The blade angle will not change  again until the pilot changes it. The use of a governor is the  next step in the evolution of propeller development, making  way for constant-speed propellers with governor systems. An  example of a two-position propeller is a Hamilton Standard  flyweight two-position propeller. These types of propeller  are not in wide use today.  

# Constant-Speed Propellers  

The propeller has a natural tendency to slow down as the  aircraft climbs and to speed up as the aircraft dives because  the load on the engine varies. To provide an efficient propeller,  the speed is kept as constant as possible. By using propeller  governors to increase or decrease propeller pitch, the engine  speed is held constant. When the aircraft goes into a climb, the  blade angle of the propeller decreases just enough to prevent  the engine speed from decreasing. The engine can maintain its  power output if the throttle setting is not changed. When the  aircraft goes into a dive, the blade angle increases sufficiently  to prevent overspeeding and, with the same throttle setting,  the power output remains unchanged. If the throttle setting  is changed instead of changing the speed of the aircraft by  climbing or diving, the blade angle increases or decreases  as required to maintain a constant engine rpm. The power  output (not the rpm) changes in accordance with changes in  the throttle setting. The governor-controlled, constant-speed  propeller changes the blade angle automatically, keeping  engine rpm constant.  

One type of pitch-changing mechanism is operated by oil  pressure (hydraulically) and uses a piston-and-cylinder  arrangement. The piston may move in the cylinder, or the  cylinder may move over a stationary piston. The linear  motion of the piston is converted by several different types  of mechanical linkage into the rotary motion necessary to  change the blade angle. The mechanical connection may be  through gears, the pitch-changing mechanism that turns the  butt of each blade. Each blade is mounted with a bearing  that allows the blade to rotate to change pitch.  [Figure 7-13]  

In most cases, the oil pressure for operating the different types  of hydraulic pitch-changing mechanisms comes directly from  the engine lubricating system. When the engine lubricating  system is used, the engine oil pressure is usually boosted  by a pump that is integral with the governor to operate the  propeller. The higher oil pressure (approximately 300 pounds  per square inch (psi)) provides a quicker blade-angle change.  The governors direct the pressurized oil for operation of the  hydraulic pitch-changing mechanisms.  

The governors used to control hydraulic pitch-changing  mechanisms are geared to the engine crankshaft and are  sensitive to changes in rpm. When rpm increases above the  value for which a governor is set, the governor causes the  propeller pitch-changing mechanism to turn the blades to a  higher angle. This angle increases the load on the engine,  and rpm decreases. When rpm decreases below the value  for which a governor is set, the governor causes the pitch- changing mechanism to turn the blades to a lower angle; the  load on the engine is decreased, and rpm increases. Thus, a  propeller governor tends to keep engine rpm constant.  

![](images/2ac0a8336730d6d57e5a6fdbddf7f87849e2534e084d9dbf542d1da773117875.jpg)  
Figure 7-13.   Blade bearing areas in hub.  

In constant-speed propeller systems, the control system adjusts  pitch through the use of a governor, without attention by the  pilot, to maintain a specific preset engine rpm within the set  range of the propeller. For example, if engine speed increases,  an overspeed condition occurs and the propeller needs to slow  down. The controls automatically increase the blade angle  until desired rpm has been reestablished. A good constant- speed control system responds to such small variations of rpm  that for all practical purposes, a constant rpm is maintained.  

Each constant-speed propeller has an opposing force  that operates against the oil pressure from the governor.  Flyweights mounted to the blades move the blades in the high  pitch direction as the propeller turns.  [Figure 7-13]  Other  forces used to move the blades toward the high pitch direction  include air pressure (contained in the front dome), springs,  and aerodynamic twisting moment.  

# Feathering Propellers  

Feathering propellers must be used on multi-engine aircraft to  reduce propeller drag to a minimum under one or more engine  failure conditions. A feathering propeller is a constant-speed  propeller used on multi-engine aircraft that has a mechanism  to change the pitch to an angle of approximately   $90°$  . A  propeller is usually feathered when the engine fails to develop  power to turn the propeller. By rotating the propeller blade  angle parallel to the line of flight, the drag on the aircraft is  greatly reduced. With the blades parallel to the airstream, the  propeller stops turning and minimum windmilling, if any,  occurs. The blades are held in feather by aerodynamic forces.  

Almost all small feathering propellers use oil pressure to take  the propeller to low pitch and blade flyweights, springs, and  compressed air to take the blades to high pitch. Since the  blades would go to the feather position during shutdown,  latches lock the propeller in the low pitch position as the  propeller slows down at shutdown.  [Figure 7-14]  These can  be internal or external and are contained within the propeller  hub. In flight, the latches are prevented from stopping the  blades from feathering because they are held off their seat by  centrifugal force. Latches are needed to prevent excess load  on the engine at start up. If the blade were in the feathered  position during engine start, the engine would be placed  under an undue load during a time when the engine is already  subject to wear.  

# Reverse-Pitch Propellers  

Additional refinements, such as reverse-pitch propellers  (mainly used on turbo props), are included in some propellers  to improve their operational characteristics. Almost all  reverse-pitch propellers are of the feathering type. A reverse- pitch propeller is a controllable propeller in which the blade  angles can be changed to a negative value during operation.  

![](images/ebbaa3b02dad580997d848d73d1df36252a3cf3fe1ca5007972ca0fc187b1529.jpg)  
Figure 7-14.   Feathering latches.  

The purpose of the reversible pitch feature is to produce a  negative blade angle that produces thrust opposite the normal  forward direction. Normally, when the landing gear is in  contact with the runway after landing, the propellers blades  can be moved to negative pitch (reversed), which creates thrust  opposite of the aircraft direction and slows the aircraft. As the  propeller blades move into negative pitch, engine power is  applied to increase the negative thrust. This aerodynamically  brakes the aircraft and reduces ground roll after landing.  Reversing the propellers also reduces aircraft speed quickly  on the runway just after touchdown and minimizes aircraft  brake wear.  

# Propeller Governor  

A governor is an engine rpm-sensing device and high- pressure oil pump. In a constant-speed propeller system, the  governor responds to a change in engine rpm by directing  oil under pressure to the propeller hydraulic cylinder or by  releasing oil from the hydraulic cylinder. The change in oil  volume in the hydraulic cylinder changes the blade angle and  maintains the propeller system rpm. The governor is set for  a specific rpm via the flight deck propeller control, which  compresses or releases the governor speeder spring.  

A propeller governor is used to sense propeller and engine  speed and normally provides oil to the propeller for low pitch  position.  [Figure 7-15]  There are a couple of nonfeathering  propellers that operate opposite to this; they are discussed  later in this chapter. Fundamental forces, some already  discussed, are used to control blade angle variations required  for constant-speed propeller operation. These forces are:  

1.	 Centrifugal twisting moment—a component of the  

![](images/2bafacc2a5dd6e9b178f3f02623943be186ef62134d96268e31be2bb83130c00.jpg)  
Figure 7-15.   Parts of a governor.  

centrifugal force acting on a rotating blade that tends  at all times to move the blade into low pitch. 2.	 Propeller-governor oil on the propeller piston side— balances the propeller blade flyweights, which moves  the blades toward high pitch. 3.	 Propeller blade flyweights—always move the blades  toward high pitch. 4.	 Air pressure against the propeller piston—pushes  toward high pitch.  5.	 Large springs—push in the direction of high pitch and  feather. 6.	 Centrifugal twisting force—moves the blades toward  low pitch. 7.	 Aerodynamic twisting force—moves the blades  toward high pitch.  

All of the forces listed are not equal in strength. The most  powerful force is the governor oil pressure acting on the  propeller piston. This piston is connected mechanically to  the blades; as the piston moves, the blades are rotated in  proportion. By removing the oil pressure from the governor,  the other forces can force the oil from the piston chamber and  move the propeller blades in the other direction.  

# Governor Mechanism  

The engine-driven single-acting propeller governor  (constant-speed control) receives oil from the lubricating  system and boosts its pressure to that required to operate  the pitch-changing mechanism.  [Figure 7-16]  It consists  of a gear pump to increase the pressure of the engine oil,  a pilot valve controlled by flyweights in the governor to  control the flow of oil through the governor to and away  from the propeller, and a relief valve system that regulates  the operating oil pressures in the governor. A spring called  the speeder spring opposes the governor flyweight’s ability  to fly outward when turning. The tension on this spring can  be adjusted by the propeller control on the control quadrant.  The tension of the speeder spring sets the maximum rpm of  the engine in the governor mode. As the engine and propeller  rpm is increased at the maximum set point (maximum speed)  of the governor, the governor flyweights overcome the  tension of the speeder spring and move outward. This action  moves the pilot valve in the governor to release oil from the  propeller piston and allows the blade flyweights to increase  blade pitch, which increases the load on the engine, slowing  it down or maintaining the set speed.  

In addition to boosting the engine oil pressure to produce one  of the fundamental control forces, the governor maintains the  required balance between control forces by metering to, or  draining from, the propeller piston the exact quantity of oil  necessary to maintain the proper blade angle for constant- speed operation. The position of the pilot valve, with  respect to the propeller-governor metering port, regulates  the quantity of oil that flows through this port to or from  the propeller.  

A speeder spring above the rack opposes the action of the  governor flyweights, which sense propeller speed. If the  flyweights turn faster than the tension on the speeder spring,  they fly out; this is an overspeed condition. To slow the engine  propeller combination down, the blade angle (pitch) must be  increased. Oil is allowed to flow away from the propeller  piston and the flyweights increase the pitch or blade angle  slowing the propeller until it reaches an on-speed condition  where the force on the governor flyweights and the tension  on the speeder spring are balanced. This balance of forces  can be disturbed by the aircraft changing attitude (climb or  dive) or the pilot changing the tension on the speeder spring  with the propeller control on the instrument panel (i.e., if the  pilot selects a different rpm).  

# Underspeed Condition  

When the engine is operating below the rpm set by the pilot  using the flight deck control, the governor is operating in an  underspeed condition.  [Figure 7-17]  In this condition, the  flyweights tilt inward because there is not enough centrifugal  force on the flyweights to overcome the force of the speeder  spring. The pilot valve, forced down by the speeder spring,  meters oil flow to decrease propeller pitch and raise engine  rpm. If the nose of the aircraft is raised or the blades are moved  to a higher blade angle, this increases the load on the engine  and the propeller tries to slow down. To maintain a constant  speed, the governor senses the decrease in speed and increases  

![](images/d0b4ba7463d6b64ee724bc17f5faf6d507105143b03cc43314cb8a26e003dc4b.jpg)  
Figure 7-16.   Typical governor.  

oil flow to the propeller, moving the blades to a lower pitch and  allowing them to maintain the same speed. When the engine  speed starts to drop below the rpm for which the governor is  set, the resulting decrease in centrifugal force exerted by the  flyweights permits the speeder spring to lower the pilot valve  (flyweights inward), thereby opening the propeller-governor  metering port. The oil then flows through the valve port and  into the propeller piston causing the blades to move to a lower  pitch (a decrease in load).  

![](images/75bdfbb4d02b61275bc4007aeeb9afb3f83136a0eb2f84b789804c13b7ff6a84.jpg)  
Figure 7-17.   Underspeed condition.  

# Overspeed Condition  

When the engine is operating above the rpm set by the pilot  using the flight deck control, the governor is operating in  an overspeed condition.  [Figure 7-18]  In an overspeed  condition, the centrifugal force acting on the flyweights  is greater than the speeder spring force. The flyweights  tilt outward and raise the pilot valve. The pilot valve then  meters oil flow to increase propeller pitch and lower engine  rpm. When the engine speed increases above the rpm for  which the governor is set, note that the flyweights move  outward against the force of the speeder spring, raising the  pilot valve. This opens the propeller-governor metering port,  allowing governor oil flow from the propeller piston allowing  flyweights on the blades to increase pitch and slow the engine.  

# On-Speed Condition  

When the engine is operating at the rpm set by the pilot using  the flight deck control, the governor is operating on speed.  [Figure 7-19]  In an on-speed condition, the centrifugal force  acting on the flyweights is balanced by the speeder spring, and  the pilot valve is neither directing oil to nor from the propeller  hydraulic cylinder. In the on-speed condition, the forces of  the governor flyweights and the tension on the speeder spring  are equal; the propeller blades are not moving or changing  pitch. If something happens to unbalance these forces, such  as if the aircraft dives or climbs, or the pilot selects a new  rpm range through the propeller control (changes tension  on the speeder spring), then these forces are unequal and an  underspeed or overspeed condition would result. A change in  rpm comes about in the governing mode by pilot selection  of a new position of the propeller control, which changes  the tension of the governor speeder spring or by the aircraft  changing attitude. The governor, as a speed-sensing device,  causes the propeller to maintain a set rpm regardless of the  aircraft attitude. The speeder spring propeller governing range  is limited to about   $200\;\mathrm{rpm}$  . Beyond this rpm, the governor  cannot maintain the correct rpm.

Figure 7-19.   On-speed condition.  

# Governor System Operation  

If the engine speed drops below the rpm for which the  governor is set, the rotational force on the engine-driven  governor flyweights becomes less.  [Figure 7-17]  This allows  the speeder spring to move the pilot valve downward. With  the pilot valve in the downward position, oil from the gear  type pump flows through a passage to the propeller and moves  the cylinder outward. This in turn decreases the blade angle  and permits the engine to return to the on-speed setting. If the  engine speed increases above the rpm for which the governor  is set, the flyweights move against the force of the speeder  spring and raise the pilot valve. This permits the oil in the  propeller to drain out through the governor drive shaft. As  the oil leaves the propeller, the centrifugal force acting on the  flyweights turns the blades to a higher angle, which decreases  the engine rpm. When the engine is exactly at the rpm set  by the governor, the centrifugal reaction of the flyweights  balances the force of the speeder spring, positioning the pilot  valve so that oil is neither supplied to nor drained from the  propeller. With this condition, propeller blade angle does  not change. Note that the rpm setting is made by varying the  amount of compression in the speeder spring. Positioning  of the speeder rack is the only action controlled manually.  All others are controlled automatically within the governor.  

# Propellers Used on General Aviation Aircraft  

An increasing number of light aircraft are designed for  operation with governor-regulated, constant-speed propellers.  Significant segments of general aviation aircraft are still  operated with fixed-pitch propellers. Light-sport aircraft  (LSA) use multiblade fixed-pitch composite propellers on up  to medium size turbo prop aircraft with reversing propeller  systems. Larger transport and cargo turbo prop aircraft use  propeller systems with dual or double-acting governors  and differential oil pressure to change pitch. Some types  of propeller systems are beyond the scope of this text, but  several propellers and their systems are described.  

# Fixed-Pitch Wooden Propellers  

Although many of the wood propellers were used on older  aircraft, some are still in use. The construction of a fixed- pitch, wooden propeller is such that its blade pitch cannot be  changed after manufacture.  [Figure 7-20]  The choice of the  blade angle is decided by the normal use of the propeller on  an aircraft during level flight when the engine performs at  maximum efficiency. The impossibility of changing the blade  pitch on the fixed-pitch propeller restricts its use to small  aircraft with low horsepower engines in which maximum  engine efficiency during all flight conditions is of lesser  importance than in larger aircraft. The wooden, fixed-pitch  propeller is well suited for such small aircraft because of its  light weight, rigidity, economy of production, simplicity of  construction, and ease of replacement.  

A wooden propeller is not constructed from a solid block  but is built up of a number of separate layers of carefully  selected and well-seasoned hardwoods. Many woods, such  as mahogany, cherry, black walnut, and oak, are used to  some extent, but birch is the most widely used. Five to nine  separate layers are used, each about  $\%$   inch thick. The several  layers are glued together with a waterproof, resinous glue and  allowed to set. The blank is then roughed to the approximate  shape and size of the finished product. The roughed-out  propeller is then allowed to dry for approximately one week to  permit the moisture content of the layers to become equalized.  This additional period of seasoning prevents warping and  cracking that might occur if the blank were immediately  carved. Following this period, the propeller is carefully  constructed. Templates and bench protractors are used to  assure the proper contour and blade angle at all stations.  

After the propeller blades are finished, a fabric covering is  cemented to the outer 12 or 15 inches of each finished blade.  A metal tipping is fastened to most of the leading edge and tip  of each blade to protect the propeller from damage caused by  flying particles in the air during landing, taxiing, or takeoff.  [Figure 7-21]  Metal tipping may be of terneplate, Monel  metal, or brass. Stainless steel has been used to some extent.  It is secured to the leading edge of the blade by countersunk  wood screws and rivets. The heads of the screws are soldered  to the tipping to prevent loosening, and the solder is filed

to make a smooth surface. Since moisture condenses on  the tipping between the metal and the wood, the tipping is  provided with small holes near the blade tip to allow this  moisture to drain away or be thrown out by centrifugal force.  It is important that these drain holes be kept open at all times. Since wood is subject to swelling, shrinking, and warping  because of changes of moisture content, a protective coating  is applied to the finished propeller to prevent a rapid change  of moisture content. The finish most commonly used is  a number of coats of water-repellent, clear varnish. After  these processes are completed, the propeller is mounted on  a spindle and very carefully balanced.  

Several types of hubs are used to mount wooden propellers  on the engine crankshaft. The propeller may have a forged  steel hub that fits a splined crankshaft; it may be connected  to a tapered crankshaft by a tapered, forged steel hub; or it  may be bolted to a steel flange forged on the crankshaft. In  any case, several attaching parts are required to mount the  propeller on the shaft properly.  

Hubs fitting a tapered shaft are usually held in place by a  retaining nut that screws onto the end of the shaft. On one  model, a locknut is used to safety the retaining nut and to  provide a puller for removing the propeller from the shaft.  This nut screws into the hub and against the retaining nut.  The locknut and the retaining nut are safetied together with  lock-wire or a cotter pin.  

Front and rear cones may be used to seat the propeller  properly on a splined shaft. The rear cone is a one-piece  bronze cone that fits around the shaft and against the thrust  nut (or spacer) and seats in the rear-cone seat of the hub.  The front cone is a two-piece, split-type steel cone that has  a groove around its inner circumference so that it can be  fitted over a flange of the propeller retaining nut. Then, the  retaining nut is threaded into place and the front cone seats  in the front cone hub. A snap ring is fitted into a groove in  the hub in front of the front cone so that when the retaining  nut is unscrewed from the propeller shaft, the front cone acts  against the snap ring and pulls the propeller from the shaft.  

One type of hub incorporates a bronze bushing instead of a  front cone. When this type of hub is used, it may be necessary  to use a puller to start the propeller from the shaft. A rear- cone spacer is sometimes provided with the splined-shaft  propeller assembly to prevent the propeller from interfering  with the engine cowling. The wide flange on the rear face of  some types of hubs eliminates the use of a rear-cone spacer.  

One type of hub assembly for the fixed-pitch, wooden  propeller is a steel fitting inserted in the propeller to mount it  on the propeller shaft. It has two main parts: the faceplate and  the flange plate.  [Figure 7-22]  The faceplate is a steel disc that  forms the forward face of the hub. The flange plate is a steel  flange with an internal bore splined to receive the propeller  shaft. The end of the flange plate opposite the flange disc is  externally splined to receive the faceplate; the faceplate bore  has splines to match these external splines. Both faceplate and  flange plates have a corresponding series of holes drilled on  the disc surface concentric with the hub center. The bore of  the flange plate has a   $15^{\circ}$   cone seat on the rear end and a  $30^{\circ}$    cone seat on the forward end to center the hub accurately on  the propeller shaft.  

# Metal Fixed-Pitch Propellers  

Metal fixed-pitch propellers are similar in general appearance  to a wooden propeller, except that the sections are usually  thinner. The metal fixed-pitch propeller is widely used on  many models of light aircraft and LSA. Many of the earliest  metal propellers were manufactured in one piece of forged  Duralumin. Compared to wooden propellers, they were  lighter in weight because of elimination of blade-clamping  devices, offered a lower maintenance cost because they were  made in one piece, provided more efficient cooling because  of the effective pitch nearer the hub, and, because there was  no joint between the blades and the hub, the propeller pitch  could be changed, within limits, by twisting the blade slightly  by a propeller repair station.  

Propellers of this type are now manufactured as one-piece  anodized aluminum alloy. They are identified by stamping the  propeller hub with the serial number, model number, Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) type certificate number,  production certificate number, and the number of times the  propeller has been reconditioned. The complete model number  of the propeller is a combination of the basic model number  and suffix numbers to indicate the propeller diameter and  pitch. An explanation of a complete model number, using the  McCauley 1B90/CM propeller, is provided in  Figure 7-23.

# Constant-Speed Propellers  

# Hartzell Constant-Speed, Nonfeathering  

Hartzell propellers can be divided by Aluminum hub  (compact) and steel hub. Hartzell compact aluminum  propellers represent new concepts in basic design. They  combine low weight and simplicity in design and rugged  construction. In order to achieve these ends, the hub is made  as compact as possible, utilizing aluminum alloy forgings for  most of the parts. The hub shell is made in two halves, bolted  together along the plane of rotation. This hub shell carries  the pitch change mechanism and blade roots internally. The  hydraulic cylinder, which provides power for changing the  pitch, is mounted at the front of the hub. The propeller can be  installed only on engines with flanged mounting provisions.  

One model of nonfeathering aluminum hub constant-speed  propeller utilizes oil pressure from a governor to move the  blades into high pitch (reduced rpm). The centrifugal twisting  moment of the blades tends to move them into low pitch  (high rpm) in the absence of governor oil pressure. This is an  exception to most of the aluminum hub models and feathering  models. Most of the Hartzell propeller aluminum and steel  hub models use centrifugal force acting on blade flyweights to  increase blade pitch and governor oil pressure for low pitch.  Many types of light aircraft use governor-regulated, constant- speed propellers in two-bladed and up to six-bladed versions.  These propellers may be the nonfeathering type, or they may  be capable of feathering and reversing. The steel hub contains  a central “spider,” that supports aluminum blades with a  tube extending inside the blade roots. Blade clamps connect  the blade shanks with blade retention bearings. A hydraulic  cylinder is mounted on the rotational axis connected to the  blade clamps for pitch actuation.  [Figure 7-24]  

The basic hub and blade retention is common to all models  described. The blades are mounted on the hub spider for  angular adjustment. The centrifugal force of the blades,  amounting to as much as 25 tons, is transmitted to the hub  

![](images/9329ed3f627fc6e4b353b1660b53b76ecbe3df6ada31d25449e2ef87618613bb.jpg)

spider through blade clamps and then through ball bearings.  The propeller thrust and engine torque is transmitted from the  blades to the hub spider through a bushing inside the blade  shank. In order to control the pitch of the blades, a hydraulic  piston-cylinder element is mounted on the front of the hub  spider. The piston is attached to the blade clamps by means  of a sliding rod and fork system for nonfeathering models  and a link system for the feathering models. The piston is  actuated in the forward direction by means of oil pressure  supplied by a governor, which overcomes the opposing force  created by the flyweights. Hartzell and McCauley propellers  for light aircraft are similar in operation. The manufacturer’s  specifications and instructions must be consulted for  information on specific models.  

# Constant-Speed Feathering Propeller  

The feathering propeller utilizes a single oil supply from a  governing device to hydraulically actuate a change in blade  angle.  [Figure 7-25]  This propeller has five blades and is  used primarily on Pratt & Whitney turbine engines. A two  piece aluminum hub retains each propeller blade on a thrust  bearing. A cylinder is attached to the hub and contains a  feathering spring and piston. The hydraulically actuated  piston transmits linear motion through a pitch change rod and  fork to each blade to result in blade angle change.  

While the propeller is operating, the following forces are  constantly present: 1) spring force, 2) flyweight force, 3)  

centrifugal twisting moment of each blade, and 4) blade  aerodynamic twisting forces. The spring and flyweight forces  attempt to rotate the blades to higher blade angle, while  the centrifugal twisting moment of each blade is generally  toward lower blade angle. Blade aerodynamic twisting force  is usually very small in relation to the other forces and can  attempt to increase or decrease blade angle. The summation  of the propeller forces is toward higher pitch (low rpm) and  is opposed by a variable force toward lower pitch (high rpm).  

The variable force is oil under pressure from a governor with  an internal pump that is mounted on and driven by the engine.  The oil from the governor is supplied to the propeller and  hydraulic piston through a hollow engine shaft. Increasing  the volume of oil within the piston and cylinder decreases  the blade angle and increases propeller rpm. If governor- supplied oil is lost during operation, the propeller increases  pitch and feather. Feathering occurs because the summation  of internal propeller forces causes the oil to drain out of the  propeller until the feather stop position is reached. Normal  in-flight feathering is accomplished when the pilot retards the  propeller condition lever past the feather detent. This permits  control oil to drain from the propeller and return to the engine  sump. Engine shutdown is normally accomplished during  the feathering process. Normal in-flight unfeathering is  accomplished when the pilot positions the propeller condition  lever into the normal flight (governing) range and restarts the  engine. As engine speed increases, the governor supplies oil

to the propeller and the blade angle decreases. Decreasing the  volume of oil increases blade angle and decreases propeller  rpm. By changing blade angle, the governor can vary the  load on the engine and maintain constant engine rpm (within  limits), independent of where the power lever is set. The  governor uses engine speed sensing mechanisms that permit  it to supply or drain oil as necessary to maintain constant  engine speed (rpm). Most of the steel hub Hartzell propellers  and many of the aluminum hub are full feathering. These  feathering propellers operate similarly to the nonfeathering  ones except the feathering spring assists the flyweights to  increase the pitch. This propeller is normally placed in the full  high pitch position before the engine is shut down to prevent  exposure and corrosion of the pitch changing mechanism.  

Feathering is accomplished by releasing the governor oil  pressure, allowing the flyweights and feathering spring to  feather the blades. This is done by pulling the condition lever  (pitch control) back to the limit of its travel, which opens up  a port in the governor allowing the oil from the propeller  to drain back into the engine. Feathering occurs because  the summation of internal propeller forces causes the oil to  drain out of the propeller until the feather stop position is  reached. The time necessary to feather depends upon the size  of the oil passage from the propeller to the engine, and the  force exerted by the spring and flyweights. The larger the  passage is through the governor and the heavier the spring,  the quicker the feathering action is. An elapsed time for  feathering of between 3 and 10 seconds is usual with this  system. Engine shutdown is normally accomplished during  the feathering process.  

In order to prevent the feathering spring and flyweights from  feathering the propeller when the engine is shut down and the  engine stopped, automatically removable high-pitch stops  were incorporated in the design. These consist of spring- loaded latches fastened to the stationary hub that engage  high-pitch stop plates bolted to the movable blade clamps.  When the propeller is in rotation at speeds over  $600{\mathrm{-}}800\,\mathrm{rpm}$  ,  centrifugal force acts to disengage the latches from the high- pitch stop plates so that the propeller pitch may be increased  to the feathering position. At lower rpm, or when the engine  is stopped, the latch springs engage the latches with the high- pitch stops, preventing the pitch from increasing further due to  the action of the feathering spring. As mentioned earlier, the  engine load would be excessive, especially on fixed-turbine  turboprop engines. One safety feature inherent in this method  of feathering is that the propeller feathers if the governor oil  pressure drops to zero for any reason. As the governor obtains  its supply of oil from the engine lubricating system, it follows  that if the engine runs out of oil or if oil pressure fails due  to breakage of a part of the engine, the propeller feathers  automatically. This action may save the engine from further  

# Unfeathering  

Unfeathering can be accomplished by any of several methods,  as follows:  

1.	 Start the engine, so the governor can pump oil back  into the propeller to reduce pitch. In most light twins,  this procedure is considered adequate since the  feathering of the propeller would happen infrequently.  Vibration can occur when the engine starts and the  propeller starts to come out of feather. 2.	 Provide an accumulator connected to the governor  with a valve to trap an air-oil charge when the propeller  is feathered but released to the propeller when the rpm  control is returned to normal position. This system is  used with training aircraft because it unfeathers the  propeller in a very short time and starts the engine  windmilling. 3.	 Provide an unfeathering pump that provides pressure  to force the propeller back to low pitch quickly using  engine oil.  

Normal in-flight unfeathering   is accomplished when the pilot  positions the propeller condition lever into the normal flight  (governing) range.  [Figure 7-26]  This causes the governor to  disconnect the propeller oil supply from drain and reconnects  it to the governed oil supply line from the governor. At that  point, there is no oil available from the engine oil pump to  the governor; therefore, no governed oil is available from the  governor for controlling the propeller blade angle and rpm.  As the engine is started, its speed increases, the governor  supplies oil to the propeller, and the blade angle decreases.  As soon as the engine is operating, the governor starts to  unfeather the blades. Soon, windmilling takes place, which  speeds up the process of unfeathering.  

In general, restarting and unfeathering of propellers can  be classified as reciprocating engine restart unfeathering,  turboprop engine restart unfeathering, and accumulator  unfeathering. When reciprocating unfeathering is used, the  engine takes a little longer to start turning enough to provide  oil pressure to the governor and then to the propeller. This  delay can cause vibration as the propeller is unfeathered.  Many aircraft can use an accumulator to provide stored  pressure to unfeather the propeller much quicker.  

Special unfeathering systems are available for certain aircraft  where restarting the engine is difficult or for training purposes.  The system consists of an oil accumulator connected to the  governor through a valve.  [Figure 7-26]  The air or nitrogen  pressure in one side of the accumulator pushes a piston to  force oil from the other side of the accumulator through  

![](images/f62af5f4c16300fc3b09d79e1cf0567e47371c50d5cf6fc74e37373b7a46d491.jpg)  
Figure 7-26.   Unfeathering system.  

the governor to the propeller piston to move the propeller  blades from feather to a lower blade angle. The propeller  then begins to windmill and permits the engine to start. When  the unfeathering pump is used, it is an additional pump that,  once the propeller control is in the correct position, the (full  increase rpm) pump is actuated and the oil pressure from the  pump unfeathers the propeller.  

# Propeller Auxiliary Systems  

# Ice Control Systems  

Ice formation on a propeller blade, in effect, produces a  distorted blade airfoil section that causes a loss in propeller  efficiency. Generally, ice collects asymmetrically on a  propeller blade and produces propeller unbalance and  destructive vibration and increases the weight of the blades.  

# Anti-Icing Systems  

A typical fluid system includes a tank to hold a supply of  anti-icing fluid.  [Figure 7-27]  This fluid is forced to each  propeller by a pump. The control system permits variation  in the pumping rate so that the quantity of fluid delivered to  a propeller can be varied, depending on the severity of icing.  

Fluid is transferred from a stationary nozzle on the engine  nose case into a circular U-shaped channel (slinger ring)  mounted on the rear of the propeller assembly. The fluid  under pressure of centrifugal force is transferred through  nozzles to each blade shank.  

Because airflow around a blade shank tends to disperse  anti-icing fluids to areas where ice does not collect in large  quantities, feed shoes, or boots, are installed on the blade leading edge. These feed shoes are a narrow strip of rubber  extending from the blade shank to a blade station that is  approximately 75 percent of the propeller radius. The feed  shoes are molded with several parallel open channels in  which fluid flows from the blade shank toward the blade  tip by centrifugal force. The fluid flows laterally from the  channels over the leading edge of the blade.  

Isopropyl alcohol is used in some anti-icing systems because  of its availability and low cost. Phosphate compounds are  comparable to isopropyl alcohol in anti-icing performance  and have the advantage of reduced flammability. However,  phosphate compounds are comparatively expensive  and, consequently, are not widely used. This system has  

![](images/67b73e993137e86b306ae10ba9d9c7abb61e8ccada3181263a269b9e8da439d4.jpg)  
Figure 7-27.   Typical propeller fluid anti-icing system.  

disadvantages in that it requires several components that add  weight to the aircraft, and the time of anti-ice available is  limited to the amount of fluid on board. This system is not used  on modern aircraft, giving way to the electric deicing systems.  

# Deicing Systems  

An electric propeller-icing control system consists of an  electrical energy source, a resistance heating element, system  controls, and necessary wiring.  [Figure 7-28]  The heating  elements are mounted internally or externally on the propeller  spinner and blades. Electrical power from the aircraft system  is transferred to the propeller hub through electrical leads, which terminate in slip rings and brushes. Flexible connectors  are used to transfer power from the hub to the blade elements.  

A deice system consists of one or more on-off switches.  The pilot controls the operation of the deice system by  turning on one or more switches. All deice systems have a  master switch and may have another toggle switch for each  propeller. Some systems may also have a selector switch  to adjust for light or heavy icing conditions or automatic  switching for icing conditions.  

The timer or cycling unit determines the sequence of which  blades (or portion thereof) are currently being deiced, and for  what length of time. The cycling unit applies power to each  deice boot, or boot segment, in a sequence or all on order.  

A brush block, which is normally mounted on the engine  just behind the propeller, is used to transfer electricity to  the slip ring. A slip ring and brush block assembly is shown  in  Figure 7-29 . The slip ring rotates with the propeller and  provides a current path to the blade deice boots. A slip ring  wire harness is used on some hub installations to electrically  connect the slip ring to the terminal strip connection screw.  A deice wire harness is used to electrically connect the deice  boot to the slip ring assembly.  

A deice boot contains internal heating elements or dual  elements.  [Figure 7-30]  The boot is securely attached to the  leading edge of each blade with adhesive.  

![](images/dc4b62ee1dfd3f1390b3e67809e804613962f9aca8b6ee9ceb2dcc6d1b24937f.jpg)

Icing control is accomplished by converting electrical energy  to heat energy in the heating element. Balanced ice removal  from all blades must be obtained as nearly as possible if  excessive vibration is to be avoided. To obtain balanced ice  removal, variation of heating current in the blade elements  is controlled so that similar heating effects are obtained in  opposite blades.  

Electric deicing systems are usually designed for intermittent  application of power to the heating elements to remove ice  after formation but before excessive accumulation. Proper  control of heating intervals aids in preventing runback,  since heat is applied just long enough to melt the ice face in  contact with the blade. If heat supplied to an icing surface  is more than that required for melting just the inner ice face,  but insufficient to evaporate all the water formed, water will  run back over the unheated surface and freeze. Runback of  this nature causes ice formation on uncontrolled icing areas  of the blade or surface.  

Cycling timers are used to energize the heating element  circuits for periods of 15 to 30 seconds, with a complete cycle  time of 2 minutes. A cycling timer is an electric motor driven  contactor that controls power contactors in separate sections  of the circuit. Controls for propeller electrical deicing systems  include on-off switches, ammeters or loadmeters to indicate  current in the circuits, and protective devices, such as current  limiters or circuit breakers. The ammeters or loadmeters  permit monitoring of individual circuit currents and reflect  operation of the timer. To prevent element overheating, the  propeller deicing system is used only when the propellers are  rotating and for short test periods of time during the takeoff  check list or system inspection.  

# Propeller Synchronization & Synchrophasing  

Most multi-engine aircraft are equipped with propeller  synchronization systems. Synchronization systems provide  a means of controlling and synchronizing engine rpm.  Synchronization reduces vibration and eliminates the  unpleasant beat produced by unsynchronized propeller  operation. The synchrophasing system is designed to  maintain a preset angular relationship between the designated  master propeller and the slave propellers.  

A typical synchrophasing system is an electronic system.  [Figure 7-31]  It functions to match the rpm of both engines  and establish a blade phase relationship between the left  and right propellers to reduce cabin noise. The system is  controlled by a two-position switch located forward of the  throttle quadrant. Turning the control switch on supplies   direct current (DC) power to the electronic control box.  Input signals representing propeller rpm are received from  magnetic pickup on each propeller. The computed input  signals are corrected to a command signal and sent to a rpm  trimming coil located on the propeller governor of the slow  engine. Its rpm is adjusted to that of the other propeller.  

![](images/5950d6ffd0f1b626c0f972229f4ff840e884d78520af6a6758170b36a49e855b.jpg)  
Figure 7-31.   Synchrophasing system.  

# Autofeathering System  

An autofeather system is used normally only during takeoff,  approach, and landing. It is used to feather the propeller  automatically if power is lost from either engine. The system  uses a solenoid valve to dump oil pressure from the propeller  cylinder (this allows the prop to feather) if two torque  switches sense low torque from the engine. This system has  a test-off-arm switch that is used to arm the system.  

The autofeather system automatically energizes the holding  coil (pulling in the feather button) when engine power loss  results in a propeller thrust drop to a preset value. This system  is switch-armed for use during takeoff and can function only  when the power lever is near or in the “takeoff” position.  

The NTS device mechanically moves the NTS plunger,  which actuates a linkage in the propeller control when a  predetermined negative torque value is sensed (when the  propeller drives the engine). This plunger, working through  control linkage, shifts the feather valve plunger, sending the  blades toward feather.  

As the blade angle increases, negative torque decreases until  the NTS signal is removed, closing the feather valve. If the  predetermined negative torque value is again exceeded, the  NTS plunger again causes the feather valve plunger to shift.  The normal effect of the NTS is a cycling of rpm slightly  below the rpm at which the negative torque was sensed.  

Unfeathering is initiated by pulling the feather button to  the “unfeather” position. This action supplies voltage to the  auxiliary motor to drive the auxiliary pump. Because the  propeller governor is in an underspeed position with the  propeller feathered, the blades will move in a decreased pitch  direction under auxiliary pump pressure.  

The pitch lock operates in the event of a loss of propeller  oil pressure or an overspeed. The ratchets of the assembly  become engaged when the oil pressure, which keeps them  apart, is dissipated through a flyweight-actuated valve, which  operates at an rpm slightly higher than the   $100\%$   rpm The  ratchets become disengaged when high pressure and rpm  settings are restored.  

At the “flight idle” power lever position, the control beta  follow-up low-pitch stop on the beta set cam (on the alpha  shaft) is set about 2' below the flight low-pitch stop setting,  acting as a secondary low-pitch stop. At the “takeoff” power  lever position, this secondary low-pitch stop sets a higher  blade angle stop than the mechanical flight low-pitch stop.  This provides for control of overspeed after rapid power lever  advance, as well as a secondary low-pitch stop.  

# Propeller Inspection & Maintenance  

Propellers must be inspected regularly. The exact time  interval for particular propeller inspections is usually  specified by the propeller manufacturer. The regular daily  inspection of propellers varies little from one type to another.  

Typically, it is a visual inspection of propeller blades, hubs,  controls, and accessories for security, safety, and general  condition. Visual inspection of the blades does not mean  a careless or casual observation. The inspection should be  meticulous enough to detect any flaw or defect that may exist.  

Inspections performed at greater intervals of time (e.g., 25,  50, or 100 hours) usually include a visual check of:  

1.	 Blades, spinners, and other external surfaces for  excessive oil or grease deposits. 2.	 Weld and braze sections of blades and hubs for  evidence of failure. 3.	 Blade, spinner, and hubs for nicks, scratches, or other  flaws. Use a magnifying glass if necessary. 4.	 Spinner or dome shell attaching screws for tightness. 5.	 The lubricating requirements and oil levels, when  applicable.  

If a propeller is involved in an accident, and a possibility  exists that internal damage may have occurred, or if a  propeller has had a ground strike or sudden stoppage, the  recommendations of the engine and propeller manufacturer's  maintenance manual need to be adhered to. The propeller  should be disassembled and inspected. Whenever a propeller  is removed from a shaft, the hub cone seats, cones, and other  contact parts should be examined to detect undue wear,  galling, or corrosion.  

It is also vitally important to keep up-to-date airworthiness  directives (ADs) or service bulletins (SBs) for a propeller.  Compliance with ADs is required to make the aircraft legally  airworthy, but it is also important to follow the SBs. All work  performed on the propeller, including AD and SB compliance,  should be noted in the propeller logbook.  

The propeller inspection requirements and maintenance  procedures discussed in this section are representative of  those in widespread use on most of the propellers described  in this chapter. No attempt has been made to include detailed  maintenance procedures for a particular propeller, and  all pressures, figures, and sizes are solely for the purpose  of illustration and do not have specific application. For  maintenance information on a specific propeller, always refer  to applicable manufacturer instructions.  

# Wood Propeller Inspection  

Wood propellers should be inspected frequently to ensure  airworthiness. Inspect for defects, such as cracks, dents,  warpage, glue failure, delamination defects in the finish, and  charring of the wood between the propeller and the flange  due to loose propeller mounting bolts. Examine the wood  close to the metal sleeve of wood blades for cracks extending  outward on the blade. These cracks sometimes occur at the  threaded ends of the lag screws and may be an indication of  internal cracking of the wood. Check the tightness of the lag  screws, which attach the metal sleeve to the wood blade, in  accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In-flight tip  failures may be avoided by frequent inspections of the metal  cap, leading edge strip, and surrounding areas. Inspect for  such defects as looseness or slipping, separation of soldered  joints, loose screws, loose rivets, breaks, cracks, eroded  sections, and corrosion. Inspect for separation between the  metal leading edge and the cap, which would indicate the cap  is moving outward in the direction of centrifugal force. This  condition is often accompanied by discoloration and loose  rivets. Inspect the tip for cracks by grasping it with your hand  and slightly twisting about the longitudinal blade centerline  and by slightly bending the tip backward and forward. If the  leading edge and the cap have separated, carefully inspect  for cracks at this point. Cracks usually start at the leading  edge of the blade. Inspect moisture holes to ensure that they  are open. A fine line appearing in the fabric or plastic may  indicate a crack in the wood. Check the trailing edge of the  propeller blades for bonding, separation, or damage.  

# Metal Propeller Inspection  

Metal propellers and blades are generally susceptible to  fatigue failure resulting from the concentration of stresses  at the bottoms of sharp nicks, cuts, and scratches. It is  necessary, therefore, to frequently and carefully inspect them  for such defects and make repairs promptly. The inspection  of steel blades may be accomplished by either visual,  fluorescent penetrant or magnetic particle inspection. The  visual inspection is easier if the steel blades are covered with  engine oil or rust-preventive compound. The full length of the  leading edge (especially near the tip), the full length of the  trailing edge, the grooves and shoulders on the shank, and all  dents and scars should be examined with a magnifying glass  to decide whether defects are scratches or cracks.  

Tachometer inspection is a very important part of the overall  propeller inspection. Operation with an inaccurate tachometer  may result in restricted rpm operation and damaging high  stresses. This could shorten blade life and could result in  catastrophic failure. If the tachometer is inaccurate, then  the propeller could be turning much faster than it is rated  to turn, providing extra stress. Accuracy of the engine  tachometer should be verified at 100-hour intervals or at  annual inspection, whichever occurs first. Hartzell Propeller  recommends using a tachometer that is accurate within  $\pm\,10$  rpm and has an appropriate calibration schedule.  

# Aluminum Propeller Inspection  

Carefully inspect aluminum propellers and blades for cracks  and other flaws. A transverse crack or flaw of any size is  cause for rejection. No repairs are permitted to the shanks  (roots or hub ends) of aluminum-alloy, adjustable-pitch  blades. The shanks must be within manufacturer’s limits.  Multiple deep nicks and gouges on the leading edge and  face of the blade is cause for rejection. Use dye penetrant or  fluorescent dye penetrant to confirm suspected cracks found  in the propeller. Refer any unusual condition or appearance  revealed by these inspections to the manufacturer.  

# Composite Propeller Inspection  

Composite blades need to be visually inspected for nicks,  gouges, loose material, erosion, cracks and debonds,  and lightning strike.  [Figure 7-32]  Composite blades are  inspected for delaminations and debonds by tapping the  blade or cuff (if applicable) with a metal coin. If an audible  change is apparent, sounding hollow or dead, a debond or  delamination is likely.  [Figure 7-33]  Blades that incorporate  a “cuff” have a different tone when coin tapped in the cuff   area. To avoid confusing the sounds, coin tap the cuff area and  the transition area between the cuff and the blade separately  from the blade area. Additional nondestructive testing (NDT)  techniques for composite materials, such as phased array  inspections, and ultrasound inspections, are available for  more detailed inspections.  

Repairs to propellers are often limited to minor type repairs.  Certificated mechanics are not allowed to perform major  repairs on propellers. Major repairs need to be accomplished  by a certificated propeller repair station.

# Propeller Vibration  

Although vibration can be caused by the propeller, there are  numerous other possible sources of vibration that can make  troubleshooting difficult. If a propeller vibrates, whether  due to balance, angle, or track problems, it typically vibrates  throughout the entire rpm range, although the intensity of the  vibration may vary with the rpm. If a vibration occurs only at  one particular rpm or within a limited rpm range (e.g., 2200–  $2350\,\mathrm{rpm)}$  ), the vibration is not normally a propeller problem  but a problem of a poor engine-propeller match. If a propeller  vibration is suspected but cannot be positively determined,  the ideal troubleshooting method is to temporarily replace the  propeller with one known to be airworthy and then test fly the  aircraft if possible. Blade shake is not the source of vibration  problems. Once the engine is running, centrifugal force holds  the blades firmly (approximately 30,000–40,000 pounds)  against blade bearings. Cabin vibration can sometimes be  improved by reindexing the propeller to the crankshaft. The  propeller can be removed, rotated  $180^{\circ}$  , and reinstalled. The  propeller spinner can be a contributing factor to an out-of- balance condition. An indication of this would be a noticeable  spinner wobble while the engine is running. This condition is  usually caused by inadequate shimming of the spinner front  support or a cracked or deformed spinner.  

When powerplant vibration is encountered, it is sometimes  difficult to determine whether it is the result of engine  vibration or propeller vibration. In most cases, the cause of  the vibration can be determined by observing the propeller  hub, dome, or spinner while the engine is running within a  1,200- to   $_{1,500-\mathrm{rpm}}$   range and determining whether or not  the propeller hub rotates on an absolutely horizontal plane.  If the propeller hub appears to swing in a slight orbit, the  vibration is usually caused by the propeller. If the propeller  hub does not appear to rotate in an orbit, the difficulty is  probably caused by engine vibration.  

When propeller vibration is the reason for excessive vibration,  the difficulty is usually caused by propeller blade imbalance,  propeller blades not tracking, or variation in propeller blade  angle settings. Check the propeller blade tracking and then  the low-pitch blade angle setting to determine if either is  the cause of the vibration. If both propeller tracking and  low blade angle setting are correct, the propeller is statically  or dynamically unbalanced and should be replaced, or re- balanced if permitted by the manufacturer.  

# Blade Tracking  

Blade tracking is the process of determining the positions of  the tips of the propeller blades relative to each other (blades  rotating in the same plane of rotation). Tracking shows only  the relative position of the blades, not their actual path. The  blades should all track one another as closely as possible. The  difference in track at like points must not exceed the tolerance  specified by the propeller manufacturer. The design and  manufacture of propellers is such that the tips of the blades  give a good indication of tracking. The following method for  checking tracking is normally used:  

1.	 Chock the aircraft so it cannot be moved. 2.	 Remove one spark plug from each cylinder. This  makes the propeller easier and safer to turn. 3.	 Rotate one of the blades so it is pointing down. 4.	 Place a solid object (e.g., a heavy wooden block that is  at least a couple of inches higher off the ground than the  distance between the propeller tip and the ground) next  to the propeller tip so that it just touches or attaches a  pointer/indicator to the cowling itself.  [Figure 7-34] 5.	 Rotate the propeller slowly to determine if the next  blade tracks through the same point (touches the block/ pointer). Each blade track should be within   $\%$   inch  

![](images/68be8f88d80325caeaa6a33fe8d32f4f5671b14c5428d1f038492e100ae6195d.jpg)

(plus or minus) from the opposite blade’s track.  

6.	 An out-of-track propeller, may be due to one or more  propeller blades being bent, a bent propeller flange,  or propeller mounting bolts that are either over- or  undertorqued. An out-of-track propeller causes  vibration and stress to the airframe and engine and  may cause premature propeller failure.  

# Checking & Adjusting Propeller Blade Angles  

When you find an improper blade angle setting during  installation or when indicated by engine performance,  follow basic maintenance guidelines. From the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions, obtain the blade angle setting and  the station at which the blade angle is checked. Do not use  metal scribes or other sharply pointed instruments to mark the  location of blade stations or make reference lines on propeller  blades, since such surface scratches can induce failure (stress  concentrator), eventually resulting in blade failure. Use a  bench-top protractor if the propeller is removed from the  aircraft.  [Figure 7-35]  Use a handheld protractor (a digital  protractor provides an easy measurement) to check blade angle  if the propeller is installed on the aircraft or is placed on the  knife-edge balancing stand.  [Figure 7-36]  

# Universal Propeller Protractor  

The universal propeller protractor can be used to check  propeller blade angles when the propeller is on a balancing  stand or installed on the aircraft engine.  Figure 7-37  shows  the parts and adjustments of a universal propeller protractor.  The following instructions for using the protractor apply to a  propeller installed on the engine. Turn the propeller until the  first blade to be checked is horizontal with the leading edge  up. Place the corner spirit level at right angles to the face of  the protractor. Align degree and vernier scales by turning  the disc adjuster before the disc is locked to the ring. The  locking device is a pin that is held in the engaged position  by a spring. The pin can be released by pulling it outward  and turning it  $90°$  .

Release the ring-to-frame lock (a right-hand screw with  thumb nut) and turn the ring until both ring and disc zeros  are at the top of the protractor.  

Check the blade angle by determining how much the flat  side of the block slants from the plane of rotation. First,  locate a point to represent the plane of rotation by placing  the protractor vertically against the end of the hub nut or any  convenient surface known to lie in the plane of propeller  

![](images/66265a46498563966ee77db322e3e88c1339284260a18ca24990b9aedce26cda.jpg)

rotation. Keep the protractor vertical by the corner spirit  level and turn the ring adjuster until the center spirit level is  horizontal. This sets the zero of the vernier scale at a point  representing the plane of propeller rotation. Then, lock the  ring to the frame.  

While holding the protractor by the handle with the curved  edge up, release the disc-to-ring lock. Place the forward  vertical edge (the edge opposite the one first used) against  the blade at the station specified in the manufacturer’s  instructions. Keep the protractor vertical by the corner spirit  level and turn the disc adjuster until the center spirit level  is horizontal. The number of degrees and tenths of a degree  between the two zeros indicates the blade angle.  

In determining the blade angle, remember that ten points on the  vernier scale are equal to nine points on the degree scale. The  graduations on the vernier scale represent tenths of a degree,  but those of the degree scale represent whole degrees. The  number of tenths of a degree in the blade angle is given by the  number of vernier scale spaces between the zero of the vernier  scale and the vernier scale graduation line nearest to perfect  alignment with a degree scale graduation line. This reading  should always be made on the vernier scale. The vernier  scale increases in the same direction that the protractor scale  increases. This is opposite to the direction of rotation of the  moving element of the protractor. After making any necessary  adjustment of the blade, lock it in position and repeat the same  operations for the remaining blades of the propeller.  

# Propeller Balancing  

Propeller unbalance, which is a source of vibration in an  aircraft, may be either static or dynamic. Propeller static  imbalance occurs when the center of gravity (CG) of the  propeller does not coincide with the axis of rotation. Dynamic  unbalance results when the CG of similar propeller elements,  such as blades or flyweights, does not follow in the same  plane of rotation. Since the length of the propeller assembly  along the engine crankshaft is short in comparison to its  diameter, and since the blades are secured to the hub so they  lie in the same plane perpendicular to the running axis, the  dynamic unbalance resulting from improper mass distribution  is negligible, provided the track tolerance requirements are  met. Another type of propeller unbalance, aerodynamic  unbalance, results when the thrust (or pull) of the blades is  unequal. This type of unbalance can be largely eliminated by  checking blade contour and blade angle setting.  

# Static Balancing  

The knife-edge test stand has two hardened steel edges  mounted to allow the free rotation of an assembled propeller  between them.  [Figure 7-38]  The knife-edge test stand must  be located in a room or area that is free from any air motion,  and preferably removed from any source of heavy vibration.  

The standard method of checking propeller assembly balance  involves the following sequence of operations:  

1.	 Insert a bushing in the engine shaft hole of the  propeller. 2.	 Insert a mandrel or arbor through the bushing. 3.	 Place the propeller assembly so that the ends of the  arbor are supported upon the balance stand knife- edges. The propeller must be free to rotate.  

If the propeller is properly balanced statically, it remains at  any position in which it is placed. Check two-bladed propeller  assemblies for balance: first with the blades in a vertical  position and then with the blades in a horizontal position.  Repeat the vertical position check with the blade positions  reversed; that is, with the blade that was checked in the  downward position placed in the upward position.  

Check a three-bladed propeller assembly with each blade  placed in a downward vertical position.  [Figure 7-39]  

During a propeller static balance check, all blades must be at  the same blade angle. Before conducting the balance check,  inspect to see that each blade has been set at the same blade  angle.  

Unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer, an  acceptable balance check requires that the propeller assembly  have no tendency to rotate in any of the positions previously  described. If the propeller balances perfectly in all described  positions, it should also balance perfectly in all intermediate  positions. When necessary, check for balance in intermediate  positions to verify the check in the originally described  positions.  [Figure 7-40]  

When a propeller assembly is checked for static balance and  there is a definite tendency of the assembly to rotate, certain  corrections to remove the unbalance are allowed.  

1.	 The addition of permanent fixed weights at acceptable  locations when the total weight of the propeller  assembly or parts is under the allowable limit. 2.	 The removal of weight at acceptable locations when  the total weight of the propeller assembly or parts is  equal to the allowable limit.  

The location for removal or addition of weight for propeller  unbalance correction has been determined by the propeller  manufacturer. The method and point of application of  unbalance corrections must be checked to see that they are  according to applicable drawings.

# Dynamic Balancing  

Propellers can also be dynamically balanced (spin balanced)  with an analyzer kit to reduce the vibration levels of the  propeller and spinner assembly. Some aircraft have the  system hardwired in the aircraft and on other aircraft the  sensors and cables need to be installed before the balancing  run. Balancing the propulsion assembly can provide  substantial reductions in transmitted vibration and noise to  the cabin and also reduces excessive damage to other aircraft  and engine components. The dynamic imbalance could be  caused by mass imbalance or any aerodynamic imbalance.  Dynamic balancing only improves the vibration caused by  mass unbalance of the externally rotating components of the  propulsion system. Balancing does not reduce the vibration  level if the engine or aircraft is in poor mechanical condition.  

Defective, worn, or loose parts will make balancing  impossible. Several manufacturers make dynamic propeller  balancing equipment, and their equipment operation could  differ. The typical dynamic balancing system consists of a  vibration sensor that is attached to the engine close to the  propeller, and an analyzer unit that calculates the weight and  location of balancing weights.  

# Balancing Procedure  

Face the aircraft directly into the wind (maximum 20 knots)  and place chocks at the wheels. When you have installed the  analyzing equipment, run the engine up at low cruise rpm; the  

![](images/e2169edd73ed8b62b29045e9cc6c9bd9cfdb3bc2f1a9aa4ce532bd6f635e48bc.jpg)  
Figure 7-40.   Static propeller balancing.  

dynamic analyzer calculates the balancing weight required at  each blade position. After installing the balancing weights,  run the engine up again to check if the vibration levels have  diminished. This process may have to be repeated several  times before satisfactory results are achieved.  

A dynamic balancing example procedure is listed here, but  always refer to the aircraft and propeller manuals when  performing any balancing procedure. Dynamic balance is  accomplished by using an accurate means of measuring the  amount and location of the dynamic imbalance. The number  of balance weights installed must not exceed the limits  specified by the propeller manufacturer. Follow the dynamic  balance equipment manufacturer’s instructions for dynamic  balance in addition to the specifications of the propeller.  

Most equipment use an optical pickup that senses reflective  tape for rpm reading. Also, there is an accelerometer mounted  to the engine that senses vibration in inches per second (ips).  

Visually inspect the propeller assembly before dynamic  balancing. The first runup of a new or overhauled propeller  assembly may leave a small amount of grease on the blades  and inner surface of the spinner dome. Use Stoddard solvent  (or equivalent) to completely remove any grease on the blades  or inner surface of the spinner dome. Visually examine each  propeller blade assembly for evidence of grease leakage.  Visually examine the inner surface of the spinner dome for  evidence of grease leakage. If there is no evidence of grease  leakage, lubricate the propeller in accordance with the  maintenance manual. If grease leakage is evident, determine  the location of the leak and correct before relubricating the  propeller and dynamic balancing. Before dynamic balance,  record the number and location of all balance weights. Static  balance is accomplished at a propeller overhaul facility when  an overhaul or major repair is performed. Twelve equally  spaced locations are recommended for weight attachment.  Install the balancing weights using aircraft quality 10-32 or  AN-3 type screws or bolts. Balance weight screws attached to  the spinner bulkhead must protrude through the self-locking  nuts or nut plates a minimum of one thread and a maximum  of four threads. Unless otherwise specified by the engine  or airframe manufacturer, Hartzell recommends that the  propeller be dynamically balanced to a reading of 0.2 ips, or  less. If reflective tape is used for dynamic balancing, remove  the tape immediately after balancing is completed. Make a  record in the propeller logbook of the number and location  of dynamic balance weights, and static balance weights if  they have been reconfigured.  

# Propeller Removal & Installation  

# Removal  

The following procedure is for demonstration purposes only.  Always use the current manufacturer’s information when  removing and installing any propeller.  

1.	 Remove the spinner dome in accordance with the  spinner removal procedures. Cut and remove the safety  wire (if installed) on the propeller mounting studs. 2.	 Support the propeller assembly with a sling. If the  propeller is reinstalled and has been dynamically  balanced, make an identifying mark (with a felt-tipped  pen only) on the propeller hub and a matching mark on  the engine flange to make sure of proper orientation  during reinstallation to prevent dynamic imbalance. 3.	 Unscrew the four mounting bolts from the engine  bushings. Unscrew the two mounting nuts and the  attached studs from the engine bushings. If the  propeller is removed between overhaul intervals,  mounting studs, nuts, and washers may be reused if  they are not damaged or corroded. 	 Caution:  Remove the propeller from the mounting  flange with care to prevent damaging the propeller  mounting studs. Using the support sling, remove the  propeller from the mounting flange.  

4.	 Place the propeller on a cart for transport.  

# Installation  

A flange propeller has six studs configured in a four-inch  circle. Two special studs that also function as dowel pins  are provided to transfer torque and index the propeller with  respect to the engine crankshaft. The dowel pin locations  used on a particular propeller installation are indicated in the  propeller model stamped on the hub. Perform the applicable  steps under Spinner Pre-Installation and clean the engine  flange and propeller flange with quick dry Stoddard solvent  or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). Install the O-ring in the O-ring  groove in the hub bore.  Note:  When the propeller is received  from the factory, the O-ring has usually been installed. With a  suitable support, such as a crane hoist or similar equipment,  carefully move the propeller assembly to the aircraft engine  mounting flange in preparation for installation.  

Install the propeller on the engine flange. Make certain  to align the dowel studs in the propeller flange with the  corresponding holes in the engine mounting flange. The  propeller may be installed on the engine flange in a given  position, or   $180^{\circ}$   from that position. Check the engine and  airframe manuals to determine if either manual specifies a  propeller mounting position.  

Caution:  Mounting hardware must be clean and dry to  prevent excessive preload of the mounting flange.  

Caution:  Tighten nuts evenly to avoid hub damage.  

Install the propeller mounting nuts (dry) with spacers. Torque  the propeller mounting nuts (dry) in accordance with the  proper specifications and safety wire the studs in pairs (if  required by the aircraft maintenance manual) at the rear of  the propeller mounting flange.  

# Servicing Propellers  

Propeller servicing includes cleaning, lubricating, and  replenishing operating lubrication supplies.  

# Cleaning Propeller Blades  

Aluminum and steel propeller blades and hubs are usually  cleaned by washing the blades with a suitable cleaning  solvent, using a brush or cloth but current manufacturer's  information should always be used. Do not use acid or caustic  materials. Power buffers, steel wool, steel brushes, or any  other tool or substance that may scratch or mar the blade  should be avoided. If a high polish is desired, a number of  good grades of commercial metal polish are available. After  completing the polishing operation, immediately remove all  traces of polish. When the blades are clean, coat them with a  clean film of engine oil or suitable equivalent.  

To clean wooden propellers, use warm water and a mild  soap, together with brushes or cloth. If a propeller has been  subjected to salt water, flush it with fresh water until all traces  of salt have been removed. This should be accomplished  as soon as possible after the salt water has splashed on  the propeller, regardless of whether the propeller parts are  aluminum alloy, steel, or wood. After flushing, thoroughly  dry all parts, and coat metal parts with clean engine oil or a  suitable equivalent.  

To remove grease or oil from propeller surfaces, apply  Stoddard solvent or equivalent to a clean cloth and wipe  the part clean. Using a noncorrosive soap solution, wash  the propeller. Thoroughly rinse with water. Permit to dry.  Aluminum and steel propeller blades and hubs usually are  cleaned by washing the blades with a suitable cleaning  solvent, using a brush or cloth. Do not use acid or caustic  materials. Avoid power buffers, steel wool, steel brushes,  or any other tool or substance that may scratch or mar the  blade. If a high polish is desired, a number of good grades of  commercial metal polish are available. After completing the  polishing operation, immediately remove all traces of polish.  When the blades are clean, coat them with a clean film of  engine oil or suitable equivalent.  

# Charging the Propeller Air Dome  

These instructions are general in nature and do not represent  any aircraft procedure. Always check the correct manual  before servicing any propeller system. Examine the propeller  to make sure that it is positioned on the start locks and using  the proper control, then charge the cylinder with dry air or  nitrogen. The air charge valve is located on the cylinder as  indicated in  Figure 7-41 . Nitrogen is the preferred charging  medium. The correct charge pressure is identified by checking  the correct table shown. The temperature is used to find the  correct pressure to charge the hub air pressure.  

# Propeller Lubrication  

Hydromatic propellers operated with engine oil and some  sealed propellers do not require lubrication. Electric propellers  require oils and greases for hub lubricants and pitch change  drive mechanisms. Proper propeller lubrication procedures,  with oil and grease specifications, are usually published in the  manufacturer’s instructions. Experience indicates that water  sometimes gets into the propeller blade bearing assembly  on some models of propellers. For this reason, the propeller  manufacturer’s greasing schedule must be followed to ensure  proper lubrication of moving parts and protection from  corrosion. Observe overhaul periods because most defects  in propellers are not external but unseen internal corrosion.  Dissimilar metals in the prop and hub create an environment  ripe for corrosion, and the only way to properly inspect many  of these areas is through a teardown. Extensive corrosion can  dramatically reduce the strength of the blades or hub. Even  

![](images/3957785985d035706c30e1e36e1a03df42786c8e3640b9bc393bc053536c972d.jpg)  
Figure 7-41.   Servicing air charge in propeller.  

seemingly minor corrosion may cause a blade or hub to fail  an inspection. Because of the safety implications (blade loss),  this is clearly an area in which close monitoring is needed.  

One example of the lubrication requirements and procedures  is detailed here for illustration purposes only. Lubrication  intervals are important to adhere to because of corrosion  implications. The propeller must be lubricated at intervals  not to exceed 100 hours or at 12 calendar months, whichever  occurs first. If annual operation is significantly less than  100 hours, calendar lubrication intervals should be reduced  to 6 months. If the aircraft is operated or stored under  adverse atmospheric conditions, such as high humidity, salt  air, calendar lubrication intervals should be reduced to 6  months. Hartzell recommends that new or newly overhauled  propellers be lubricated after the first 1 or 2 hours of operation  because centrifugal loads pack and redistribute grease,  which may result in a propeller imbalance. Redistribution  of grease may also result in voids in the blade bearing area  where moisture can collect. Remove the lubrication fitting  from the cylinder-side hub half installed in the engine-side  hub half.  [Figure 7-42]  Pump 1 fluid ounce (30 milliliters  (ml)) grease into the fitting located nearest the leading edge  of the blade on a tractor installation, or nearest the trailing  edge on a pusher installation, until grease emerges from the  hole where the fitting was removed, whichever occurs first.  

Note:  1 fluid ounce   $(30\,\mathrm{{ml})}$  ) is approximately six pumps with  

![](images/bab2848540de550f3bcaf360f8a805c2ab2ed8037bbac442b4f131c1ca3a4d4a.jpg)

a hand-operated grease gun. Reinstall the removed lubrication  fittings. Tighten the fittings until snug. Make sure that the  ball of each lubrication fitting is properly seated. Reinstall  a lubrication fitting cap on each lubrication fitting. Perform  grease replacement through attached pressure fittings (zerks)  in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Propeller Overhaul  

Propeller overhaul should be accomplished at the maximum  hours or calendar time limit, whichever occurs first. Upon  receipt for overhaul, prepare a document that tracks the  propeller components throughout the overhaul process.  Research all applicable ADs, current specifications, and  manufacturers’ SBs for incorporation during the overhaul  process. Double check the serial number and make notes on  the work order regarding the general condition in which the  propeller was received. As you disassemble and clean the  unit, perform a preliminary inspection on all related parts.  Record those revealing discrepancies requiring rework or  replacement in the overhaul record by part number, along  with the reason for the required action. Discard all threaded  fasteners during disassembly and, with a few exceptions  permitted by the manufacturer, replace with new components.  Many specialized tools and fixtures are required in the  disassembly and proper reassembly of propellers. These  tools are generally model specific and range from massive  15-foot torque adapter bars and 100-ton presses down to  tiny dowel pin alignment devices. Dimensionally inspect  components that are subject to wear to the manufacturer’s  specifications. After passing inspection, anodize aluminum  parts and cadmium plate steel parts for maximum protection  against corrosion.  

# The Hub  

Strip nonferrous hubs and components of paint and anodize  and inspect for cracks using a liquid penetrant inspection  (LPI) procedure. Etch, rinse, dry, and then immerse the  parts in a fluorescent penetrant solution. After soaking in  the penetrant, rinse them again and blow dry. Then, apply  developer, which draws any penetrant caught in cracks or  defects to the surface. Under an ultraviolet inspection lamp,  the penetrant clearly identifies the flaw. Certain models of  hubs are also eddy-current inspected around critical, high- stress areas. Eddy-current testing passes an electrical current  through a conductive material that, when disturbed by a  crack or other flaw, causes a fluctuation on a meter or CRT  display. This method of inspection can detect flaws that are  below the surface of the material and not exposed to the eye.  Magnetic particle inspection (MPI) is used to locate flaws in  steel parts. The steel parts of the propeller are magnetized by  passing a strong electrical current through them. A suspension  of fluorescent iron oxide powder and solvent is spread over  the parts. While magnetized, the particles within the fluid  on the parts surface immediately align themselves with the  discontinuity. When examined under black light, the crack  or fault shows as a bright fluorescent line.  

The first step in blade overhaul is the precise measurement  of blade width, thickness, face alignment, blade angles,  and length. Then, record the measurements on each blade’s  inspection record and check against the minimum acceptable  overhaul specifications established by the manufacturer.  Blade overhaul involves surface grinding and repitching,  if necessary. Occasionally, blade straightening is also  required. The manufacturer’s specification dictates certain  allowable limits within which a damaged blade may be cold  straightened and returned to airworthy condition. Specialized  tooling and precision measuring equipment permit pitch  changes or corrections of less than one-tenth of one degree.  To ensure accuracy, take frequent face alignment and angle  measurements during the repair process. Precision hand grind  the blade airfoil to remove all corrosion, scratches, and surface  flaws. After completely removing all stress risers and faults,  take final blade measurements and record on each blade’s  inspection record. Balance and match the propeller blades and  anodize and paint them for long-term corrosion protection.  

# Prop Reassembly  

When both the hubs and the blades have completed the  overhaul process, the propeller is ready for final assembly.  Recheck part numbers with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Lubricate and install the parts per each unit’s particular  overhaul manual. After final assembly, check both high-  and low-pitch blade angles on constant-speed propellers  for proper operation and leaks by cycling the propeller with  air pressure through its blade angle range. Then, check the  assembled propeller for static balance. If necessary, place  weights on the hub areas of each “light” blade socket to  bring about its proper balance. These weights should be  considered part of the basic hub assembly and should not be  moved during subsequent dynamic balancing to the engine.  

As with most aircraft components, all of the hardware on  the propeller assembly must be safety wired, unless secured  by self-locking devices. Then, the final inspector fills out  and signs maintenance release tags reflecting the work  accomplished, applicable ADs, and all incorporated service  documents. These documents certify that the major repairs  and/or alterations that have been made meet established  standards and that the propeller is approved for return to  service. All minor repairs and minor alterations on propellers  must be accomplished by a certified repair station, an airframe  and powerplant technician (A&P), or a person working under  the direct supervision of such a technician or an appropriately  rated air carrier. Major repairs or alterations, including the  overhaul of controllable pitch propellers, must be done by an  appropriately rated repair station, manufacturer, or air carrier.  

# Troubleshooting Propellers  

Some brief examples of troubleshooting problems and  possible causes are provided in the following subsections.  Always refer to the correct manual for actual information  on troubleshooting.  

# Hunting & Surging  

Hunting is characterized by a cyclic variation in engine speed  above and below desired speed. Surging is characterized  by a large increase/decrease in engine speed, followed by a  return to set speed after one or two occurrences. If propeller is  hunting, an appropriately licensed repair facility should check:  

1.	 Governor, 2.	 Fuel control, and 3.	 Synchrophaser or synchronizer.  

Engine Speed Varies with Flight Attitude (Airspeed) Small variances in engine speed are normal and are no cause  for concern. An increase in engine speed while descending or  increasing airspeed with a nonfeathering propeller could be:  

1.	 The governor not increasing oil volume in the  propeller, 2.	 Engine transfer bearing leaking excessively, or 3.	 Excessive friction in blade bearings or pitch changing  mechanism.  

# Failure to Feather or Feathers Slowly  

Failure to feather or slow feathering of the propeller requires  the FAA-certificated A&P technician to:  

1.	 Refer to the air charge section in the maintenance  manual if the air charge is lost or low. 2.	 Check for proper function and rigging of propeller/  governor control linkage. 3.	 Check the governor drain function. 4.	 Check the propeller for misadjustment or internal  corrosion (usually in blade bearings or pitch change  mechanism) that results in excessive friction. This  must be performed at an appropriately licensed  propeller repair facility.

# Turboprop Engines & Propeller Control  Systems  

Turboprop engines are used for many single, twin, and  commuter aircraft.  [Figure 7-43]  Smaller turboprop engines,  such as the PT-6, are used on single and twin engine designs;  the power ranges from 500 to 2,000 shaft horsepower.  [Figure 7-44]  Large commuter aircraft use turboprop engines,  such as the P&W 150 and AE2100 that can deliver up to  5,000 shaft horsepower to power mid-sized to large turboprop  aircraft.  [Figure 7-45]  The turboprop propeller is operated  by a gas turbine engine through a reduction-gear assembly.  It has proved to be an extremely efficient power source.  The combination of propeller, reduction-gear assembly, and  turbine engine is referred to as a turboprop powerplant.  

The turbofan engine produces thrust directly; the turboprop  engine produces thrust indirectly because the compressor and  turbine assembly furnishes torque to a propeller, producing  

![](images/87a991b19a91bfa06ecc253789f838a4077e9b491b3a17b16f129fc0d3ff7a8a.jpg)  
Figure 7-45.   Pratt & Whitney 150 turboprop engine.  

the major portion of the propulsive force that drives the  aircraft. The turboprop fuel control and the propeller governor  are connected and operate in coordination with each other.  

The power lever directs a signal from the flight deck to the  fuel control for a specific amount of power from the engine.  The fuel control and the propeller governor together establish  the correct combination of rpm, fuel flow, and propeller  blade angle to create sufficient propeller thrust to provide  the desired power.  

The propeller control system is divided into two types of  control: one for flight and one for ground operation. For  flight, the propeller blade angle and fuel flow for any given  power lever setting are governed automatically according to a  predetermined schedule. Below the “flight idle” power lever  position, the coordinated rpm blade angle schedule becomes  incapable of handling the engine efficiently. Here, the ground  handling range, referred to as the beta range, is encountered. In  the beta range of the throttle quadrant, the propeller blade angle  is not governed by the propeller governor but is controlled by  the power lever position. When the power lever is moved below  the start position, the propeller pitch is reversed to provide  reverse thrust for rapid deceleration of the aircraft after landing.  

A characteristic of the turboprop is that changes in power are  not related to engine speed, but to turbine inlet temperature.  During flight, the propeller maintains a constant engine  speed. This speed is known as the 100 percent rated speed  of the engine, and it is the design speed at which most power  and best overall efficiency can be obtained. Power changes  are affected by changing the fuel flow. An increase in fuel  flow causes an increase in turbine inlet temperature and a  corresponding increase in energy available at the turbine. The  turbine absorbs more energy and transmits it to the propeller  in the form of torque. The propeller, in order to absorb the  increased torque, increases blade angle, thus maintaining

Figure 7-46.   Reduction gearbox.  

# Reduction Gear Assembly  

The function of the reduction gear assembly is to reduce  the high rpm from the engine to a propeller rpm that can be  maintained without exceeding the maximum propeller tip  speed (speed of sound). Most reduction gear assemblies use  a planetary gear reduction.  [Figure 7-46]  Additional power  takeoffs are available for propeller governor, oil pump, and  other accessories. A propeller brake is often incorporated into  the gearbox. The propeller brake is designed to prevent the  propeller from windmilling when it is feathered in flight, and  to decrease the time for the propeller to come to a complete  stop after engine shutdown.  

# Turbo-Propeller Assembly  

The turbo-propeller provides an efficient and flexible  means of using the power of the engine at any condition  in flight (alpha range).  [Figure 7-47]  For ground handling  and reversing (beta range), the propeller can be operated  to provide either zero or negative thrust. The major  subassemblies of the propeller assembly are the barrel,  dome, low-pitch stop assembly, overspeed governor, pitch  control unit, auxiliary pump, feather and unfeather valves,  torque motor, spinner, deice timer, beta feedback assembly,  and propeller electronic control. Modern turboprop engines  use dual Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) to  control both engine and propeller. The spinner assembly is a  cone-shaped configuration that mounts on the propeller and  encloses the dome and barrel to reduce drag.  

Propeller operation is controlled by a mechanical linkage  from the flight deck-mounted power lever and the emergency  engine shutdown handle (if the aircraft is provided with one)  to the coordinator, which, in turn, is linked to the propeller  control input lever. Newer designs use electronic throttle  control that is linked to the FADEC controller.  

Turbo-propeller control assemblies have a feathering system  that feather the propeller when the engine is shut down in  flight. The propeller can also be unfeathered during flight, if  the engine needs to be started again. Propeller control systems  for large turboprop engines differ from smaller engines  because they are dual acting, which means that hydraulic  pressure is used to increase and decrease propeller blade  angle.  [Figure 7-48]  

# Pratt & Whitney PT6 Hartzell Propeller System  

The PT6 Hartzell propeller system incorporates three-, four‑,  or six-bladed propellers made of aluminum or composite  materials. It is a constant-speed, feathering, reversing  propeller system using a single-acting governor. Oil from  the propeller governor feeds into the propeller shaft and to

the servo piston via the oil transfer sleeve mounted on the  propeller shaft.  [Figure 7-49]  As oil pressure increases,  the servo piston is pushed forward, and the feather spring  is compressed. Servo piston movement is transmitted to  the propeller blade collars via a system of levers. When oil  pressure is decreased, the return spring and flyweights force  the oil out of the servo piston and change the blade pitch to  a high pitch position. An increase in oil pressure drives the  blades towards low pitch.  

Engine oil is supplied to the governor from the engine oil  supply. A gear pump, mounted at the base of the governor,  increases the flow of oil going to the constant speed unit  (CSU) relief valve. When the oil pressure reaches the desired  level, the relief valve opens to maintain the governor oil  pressure. When the speed selected by the pilot is reached, the  flyweight force equals the spring tension of the speeder spring.  The governor flyweights are then on speed. When the engine  output power is increased, the power turbines tend to increase  speed. The flyweights in the CSU sense this acceleration and  the flyweights go into an overspeed condition because of  the increase centrifugal force. This force causes the control  valve to move up and restrict oil flow to the propeller dome.  [Figure 7-50]  The feathering spring increases the propeller  pitch to maintain the selected speed. Reducing power causes  an under-speed of the flyweights, downward movement of  the control valve, more oil in propeller dome, resulting in a  lower pitch to control propeller speed. The propeller governor  houses an electro-magnetic coil, which is used to match the  rpm of both propellers during cruise. An aircraft supplied  synchrophaser unit controls this function.  

At low power, the propeller and governor flyweights  do not turn fast enough to compress the speeder spring.  [Figure 7-51]  In this condition, the control valve moves  down, and high pressure oil pushes the dome forward moving  the blades towards low pitch. Any further movement pulls  the beta rod and slip ring forward. The forward motion of  the slip ring is transmitted to the beta valve via the beta lever  and the carbon block. Forward movement of the beta valve  stops the oil supply to the propeller. This prevents the blade  angles from going any lower. This is the primary blade angle  (PBA) and is the minimum blade angle allowed for flight  operation. From this point, the propeller is in the beta mode.  If the engine power is reduced when the propeller is at the  primary blade angle, the propeller speed decreases since the  blade angle does not change.  

![](images/1add0403152e3c7943850df77fc3f452781cf81effda6328f21d0afcae55a643.jpg)  
Figure 7-48.   Propeller control system schematic.  

The lock-pitch solenoid valve prevents the propeller from  going into reverse or below the primary blade angle in the  event of a beta system malfunction in flight. The solenoid  is energized by a switch (airframe supplied) mechanically  connected to the propeller slip-ring linkage via a second  carbon block. As oil pressure leaks off around the propeller  shaft oil transfer sleeve, the blade angle slowly drifts back  toward high pitch. This deactivates the low pitch solenoid  valve and restores the oil supply to the propeller servo. The  low pitch solenoid valve cycles (close/open) as backup to  the beta valve function. Moving the power lever backwards  causes the reversing cam and cable to move the beta valve  backward, allowing more oil to flow into the propeller  dome, and causing the blades to go towards reverse pitch.  [Figure 7-52]  

As the blades move to reverse, the dome pulls the slip ring  forward and moves the beta valve outward, restricting the  oil flow. This stops the blade movement toward reverse. To  obtain more reverse thrust, move the power lever back more  to reset the beta valve inward, and repeat the process. Move  the reset arm on the CSU rearward by the interconnecting  rod at the same time the blade angle moves toward reverse.  This causes the reset lever and reset post to move down in  the CSU, bringing the reset lever closer to the speeder spring  cup. As propeller speed increases due to the increase in engine  power, the governor flyweights begin to move outwards.  Since the reset lever is closer to the speeder spring cup, the  cup contacts the reset lever before the flyweights would  normally reach the on-speed position (95 percent propeller  speed instead of 100 percent). As the reset lever is pushed up  by the flyweights/speeder spring cup, the Py air bleeds from  the fuel control unit (FCU) which lowers the fuel flow, engine  power, and thus propeller speed. In reverse, propeller speed  remains 5 percent below the selected propeller speed so that  the control valve remains fully open, and only the beta valve  controls the oil flow to the propeller dome.  

In this mode, the propeller speed is no longer controlled by  changing the blade angle. It is now controlled by limiting  engine power. Bringing the propeller lever to the feather  position causes the speed selection lever on the CSU to push  the feathering valve plunger and allows propeller servo oil  to dump into the reduction gearbox sump. The pressure loss  in the propeller hub causes the feathering spring and the  propeller flyweights to feather the propeller. In the event  of a propeller overspeed not controlled by the propeller  overspeed governor (oil governor), the flyweights in the  propeller governor move outward until the speeder spring cup  contacts the reset lever.  [Figure 7-53]  The movement of the  reset lever around its pivot point opens the Py air passage. Py  bleeds into the reduction gearbox limiting the fuel supply to  

![](images/83bfbc82c27b66b2a6e7b9a906978a8428cab5f8ec232e178bc4604a27e8cebe.jpg)  
Figure 7-49.   Pitch change mechanism.  

the engine. This prevents the propeller/power turbines from  accelerating beyond 106 percent rpm.  

The oil overspeed governor houses a set of flyweights  connected to a control valve that is driven by a beveled gear  mounted on the propeller shaft.  [Figure 7-54]  The flyweight’s  centrifugal force is acting against two springs: a speeder spring  and a reset spring. When the propeller speed reaches a specified  limit (4 percent over maximum propeller speed), the governor  flyweights lift the control valve and bleed off propeller servo  oil into the reduction gearbox sump, causing the blade angle  to increase. An increase in blade pitch puts more load on the  engine and slows down the propeller. To test the unit, the speed  reset solenoid is activated, and servo oil pressure pushes against  the reset piston to cancel the effect of the reset spring. With less  spring tension acting on the flyweights, the overspeed governor  can be tested at speeds lower than maximum.  

On twin installation, a second solenoid valve is mounted on  the overspeed governor and is used in conjunction with the  aircraft autofeather system. The system is switched on for  takeoff and, in the event of an engine malfunction, energizes  the solenoid valve to dump propeller servo oil into the  reduction gearbox sump. The feathering spring and propeller  flyweights move the blade quickly to feather.  

# Hamilton Standard Hydromatic Propellers  

Many of the hydromatic propellers are used with older type  aircraft involved in cargo operations. A hydromatic propeller  has a double-acting governor that uses oil pressure on both  sides of the propeller piston. Many larger turboprop systems  also use this type of system. The governors are similar in  construction and principle of operation in normal constant- speed systems. The major difference is in the pitch-changing  mechanism. In the hydromatic propeller, no flyweights are  used, and the moving parts of the mechanism are completely  enclosed. Oil pressure and the centrifugal twisting moment  of the blades are used together to turn the blades to a lower  angle. The main advantages of the hydromatic propeller are  the large blade angle range and the feathering and reversing  features.  

This propeller system is a double-acting hydraulic propeller  system in which the hydraulic pressure (engine oil pressure)  on one piston dome is used against governor oil pressure on  the other side of the piston. These two opposing hydraulic  forces are used to control and change blade angle or pitch.  Although hydromatic propeller systems are very old, some  

![](images/77bd4df0f529aebc843f0374d83fb8fd2486b21a897286c9169e9012fdc10aad.jpg)  
Figure 7-50.   Governing mode.  

are still used on radial engines. Larger new turboprop systems  also use this opposing hydraulic force and double-acting  governor systems.  

The distributor valve or engine-shaft-extension assembly  provides oil passages for governor or auxiliary oil to the  inboard side of the piston and for engine oil to the outboard  side. During unfeathering operation, the distributor shifts  under auxiliary pressure and reverses these passages so that  oil from the auxiliary pump flows to the outboard side of the  piston and oil on the inboard side flows back to the engine.  The engine-shaft-extension assembly is used with propellers  that do not have feathering capabilities.  

The hydromatic propeller  [Figure 7-55]  is composed of four  major components:  

1.	 The hub assembly, 2.	 The dome assembly, 3.	 The distributor valve assembly (for feathering on  

single-acting propellers) or engine-shaft-extension  assembly (for nonfeathering or double-acting  propellers), and  

4.	 The anti-icing assembly.  

The hub assembly is the basic propeller mechanism. It  contains both the blades and the mechanical means for  holding them in position. The blades are supported by the  spider and retained by the barrel. Each blade is free to turn  about its axis under the control of the dome assembly.  

The dome assembly contains the pitch-changing mechanism  for the blades. Its major components are the:  

1.	 rotating cam, 2.	 fixed cam, 3.	 piston, and 4.	 dome shell. When the dome assembly is installed in the propeller hub,  

![](images/196dda5225b3a2e00766318d3106077a7609aaf91de601611259b566a49ca410.jpg)  
Figure 7-51.   Beta mode forward operation.  

the fixed cam remains stationary with respect to the hub. The  rotating cam, which can turn inside the fixed cam, meshes  with gear segments on the blades. The piston operates inside  the dome shell and is the mechanism that converts engine and  governor oil pressure into forces that act through the cams  to turn propeller blades.  

# Principles of Operation  

The pitch-changing mechanism of hydromatic propellers is  a mechanical-hydraulic system in which hydraulic forces  acting on a piston are transformed into mechanical twisting  forces acting on the blades. Linear movement of the piston  is converted to rotary motion by a cylindrical cam. A bevel  gear on the base of the cam mates with bevel gear segments  attached to the butt ends of the blades, thereby turning the  blades. This blade pitch-changing action can be understood  by studying the schematic in  Figure 7-56 .  

The centrifugal force acting on a rotating blade includes a  component force that tends to move the blade toward low  pitch. As shown in  Figure 7-56 , a second force, engine oil  pressure, is supplied to the outboard side of the propeller  piston to assist in moving the blade toward low pitch.  

Propeller governor oil, taken from the engine oil supply and  boosted in pressure by the engine-driven propeller governor,  is directed against the inboard side of the propeller piston. It  acts as the counterforce, which can move the blades toward  higher pitch. By metering this high-pressure oil to, or draining  it from, the inboard side of the propeller piston by means of  the constant-speed control unit, the force toward high pitch  can balance and control the two forces toward low pitch. In  this way, the propeller blade angle is regulated to maintain  a selected rpm.  

The basic propeller control forces acting on the Hamilton  Standard propeller are centrifugal twisting force and high  pressure oil from the governor. The centrifugal force acting  on each blade of a rotating propeller includes a component  force that results in a twisting moment about the blade center  line that tends, at all times, to move the blade toward low  pitch. Governor pump output oil is directed by the governor  

![](images/9307eeeff2952f4c05e5ae2d63d8a66d708a2c7bfa0b85937f488230933e5abe.jpg)  
Figure 7-52.   Beta mode reverse operation.  

to either side of the propeller piston. The oil on the side of  the piston opposite this high-pressure oil returns to the intake  side of the governor pump and is used over again. Engine oil  at engine supply pressure does not enter the propeller directly  but is supplied only to the governor. During constant-speed  operations, the double-acting governor mechanism sends oil  to one side or the other of the piston as needed to keep the  speed at a specified setting.  

# Feathering Operation  

A typical hydromatic propeller feathering installation is  shown in  Figure 7-57 . When the feathering push-button  switch is depressed, the low current circuit is established  from the battery through the push-button holding coil and  from the battery through the solenoid relay. As long as the  circuit remains closed, the holding coil keeps the push button  in the depressed position. Closing the solenoid establishes  the high current circuit from the battery to the feathering  motor pump unit. The feathering pump picks up engine oil  from the oil supply tank, boosts its pressure, if necessary,  to the relief valve setting of the pump, and supplies it to the  governor high-pressure transfer valve connection. Auxiliary  oil entering the high-pressure transfer valve connection shifts  the governor transfer valve, which hydraulically disconnects  the governor from the propeller and at the same time opens  the propeller governor oil line to auxiliary oil. The oil flows  through the engine transfer rings, through the propeller shaft  governor oil passage, through the distributor valve port,  between lands, and finally to the inboard piston end by way  of the valve inboard outlet.  

The distributor valve does not shift during the feathering  operation. It merely provides an oil passageway to the inboard  piston end for auxiliary oil and the outboard piston end for  engine oil. The same conditions described for underspeed  operation exist in the distributor valve, except that oil at  auxiliary pressure replaces drain oil at the inboard end of  the land and between lands. The distributor-valve spring is  backed up by engine oil pressure, which means that at all  times the pressure differential required to move the piston is  

![](images/eae244814d0594e59cdb3c755c8d5be20f2a5db93868d1d7645a1a415f5dfb00.jpg)  
Figure 7-53.   Nf overspeed governor.  

identical with that applied to the distributor valve.  

The propeller piston moves outboard under the auxiliary oil  pressure at a speed proportional to the rate the oil is supplied.  This piston motion is transmitted through the piston rollers  operating in the oppositely inclined cam tracks of the fixed  cam and the rotating cam and is converted by the bevel gears  into the blade-twisting moment. Only during feathering or  unfeathering is the low mechanical advantage portion of the  cam tracks used. (The low mechanical advantage portion lies  between the break and the outboard end of the track profile.)  Oil at engine pressure, displaced from the outboard piston  end, flows through the distributor valve outboard inlet, past  the outboard end of the valve land, through the valve port, into  the propeller shaft engine oil passage, and is finally delivered  into the engine lubricating system. Thus, the blades move  toward the full high-pitch (or feathered) angle.  

Having reached the full-feathered position, further movement  of the mechanism is prevented by contact between the high- angle stop ring in the base of the fixed cam and the stop  lugs set in the teeth of the rotating cam. The pressure in the  inboard piston end now increases rapidly, and upon reaching  a set pressure, the electric cutout switch automatically opens.  

This cutout pressure is less than that required to shift the  distributor valve.  

Opening the switch deenergizes the holding coil and releases  the feathering push-button control switch. Release of this  switch breaks the solenoid relay circuit, which shuts off the  feathering pump motor. The pressures in both the inboard  and outboard ends of the piston drop to zero, and, since all  the forces are balanced, the propeller blades remain in the  feathered position. Meanwhile, the governor high-pressure  transfer valve has shifted to its normal position as soon as  the pressure in the propeller governor line drops below that  required to hold the valve open.  

# Unfeathering Operation  

To unfeather a hydromatic propeller, depress and hold in the  feathering switch push-button control switch. As in the case  of feathering a propeller, the low-current control circuits  from the battery through the holding coil and from the  battery through the solenoid are completed when the solenoid  closes. The high-current circuit from the battery starts the  motor-pump unit, and oil is supplied at a high pressure to  the governor transfer valve.  

![](images/e24817139b1d891c76abffcc8563fd36036d9a0512cdf97cdc01555c03c83824.jpg)  
Figure 7-54.   Propeller overspeed governor.  

Auxiliary oil entering through the high-pressure transfer  valve connection shifts the governor transfer valve and  disconnects the governor from the propeller line; in the same  operation, auxiliary oil is admitted. The oil flows through the  engine oil transfer rings, through the propeller shaft governor  oil passage, and into the distributor valve assembly.  

When the unfeathering operation begins, the piston is in the  extreme outboard position. The oil enters the inboard piston  end of the cylinder by way of the distributor valve inboard  outlet. As the pressure on the inboard end of the piston  increases, the pressure against the distributor valve land builds  up. When the pressure becomes greater than the combined  opposing force of the distributor valve spring and the oil  pressure behind this spring, the valve shifts. Once the valve  shifts, the passages through the distributor valve assembly to  the propeller are reversed. A passage is opened between lands  and through a port to the outboard piston end by way of the  distributor valve outlet. As the piston moves inboard under the  auxiliary pump oil pressure, oil is displaced from the inboard  piston end through the inlet ports between the valve lands,  into the propeller shaft engine oil lands, and into the propeller  shaft engine oil passage where it is discharged into the engine  lubricating system. At the same time, the pressure at the cutout  switch increases and the switch opens. However, the circuit  to the feathering pump and motor unit remains complete as  long as the feathering switch is held in.  

With the inboard end of the propeller piston connected to  drain and auxiliary pressure flowing to the outboard end of  the piston, the piston moves inboard, unfeathering the blades.  As the blades are unfeathered, they begin to windmill and  assist the unfeathering operation by the added force toward  low pitch brought about by the centrifugal twisting moment.  When the engine speed has increased to approximately 1,000  rpm, the operator shuts off the feathering pump motor. The  pressure in the distributor valve and at the governor transfer  valve decreases, allowing the distributor valve to shift under  the action of the governor high-pressure transfer valve spring.  This action reconnects the governor with the propeller and

establishes the same oil passages through the distributor valve  that are used during constant-speed and feathering operations.  

# Setting the Propeller Governor  

The propeller governor incorporates an adjustable stop that  limits the maximum speed at which the engine can run. As  soon as the takeoff rpm is reached, the propeller moves off the  low-pitch stop. The larger propeller blade angle increases the  load on the engine, thus maintaining the prescribed maximum  engine speed. At the time of propeller, propeller governor, or  engine installation, the following steps are normally taken  to ensure that the powerplant obtains takeoff rpm. During  ground runup, move the throttle to takeoff position and note  the resultant rpm and manifold pressure. If the rpm obtained  is higher or lower than the takeoff rpm prescribed in the  

![](images/46264197735e306dbaa8d5391f08c6ecc0c600763628d87b7bf4fc102c666435.jpg)

# Engine Removal & Replacement  

# Introduction  

Procedures for removing or installing an aircraft engine  usually vary widely with the type of aircraft and the type of  engine. Thus, no single list of instructions can be provided  as a guideline for all engines. Because of the many types  of engine and aircraft installations and the large number of  design variations within each type or category, representative  examples have been selected to illustrate the most typical  installation procedures for reciprocating, turboprop, and  turbofan engines. There are some common tasks that  must be accomplished when replacing an aircraft engine.  Most engines require disconnecting and reconnecting  electrical, hydraulic, fuel supply, intake and exhaust air  path components, engine controls, and engine mounting  connections to the airframe.  

Reciprocating engines and gas turbine engines are used in  this chapter to describe and represent general and typical  procedures for engine buildup, removal, preservation,  storage, and installation. Although these two types of engines  have some common areas, each procedure has been included  to ensure adequate coverage of the engines used in both  heavy and light aircraft. It should be emphasized that while  procedures for specific engines and aircraft are included  in this chapter, many pertinent or mandatory references  have been omitted because of their irrelevance to a general  discussion. For this reason, always reference the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions before performing any phase of  engine removal or installation.  

# Reasons for Removal of Reciprocating  Engines  

The following paragraphs outline the most common reasons  for removing and replacing an engine. Information to aid  in determining engine conditions that require removal  is included; however, in every case, consult applicable  manufacturer’s instructions as the final authority in  establishing the basis for engine replacement.  

# Engine or Component Lifespan Exceeded  

Engine life is dependent upon such factors as operational  use, the quality of manufacture or overhaul, the type of  aircraft in which the engine is installed, the kind of operation  being carried out, and the degree to which maintenance is  accomplished. Thus, the manufacturer sets engine removal  times. Based on service experience, it is possible to establish  a maximum expected time before overhaul (TBO) or span of  time within which an engine needs to be overhauled. Certain  critical components of turbine engines such as turbine blades,  turbine discs or combustion liners may have shorter life  limits established by the manufacturer due to the stresses  imposed on those parts during operation. The FAA requires  that the manufacture identify and establish which parts have  mandatory replacement times.  

# Engine Sudden Stoppage or Propeller Strike  

Engine sudden stoppage causes a very rapid and complete  engine stoppage. Propeller strikes can cause either reduction  in speed or a complete engine stoppage. Either can be caused  by engine seizure or by one or more of the propeller blades  striking an object in such a way that revolutions per minute  (rpm) goes to zero in less than one complete revolution  of the propeller. Sudden stoppage may occur under such  conditions as complete and rapid collapse of the landing  gear, nosing over of the aircraft, or crash landing. Sudden  stoppage can cause internal damage, such as cracked  propeller gear teeth, gear train damage, crankshaft flyweights  becoming detuned or misalignment, or damaged propeller  bearings. When sudden stoppage occurs, the engine usually  requires replacement or disassembly and inspection as per  manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Sudden Reduction in Speed  

Sudden reduction in engine speed can occur when one or  more of the propeller blades strike an object at a low engine  rpm. After impact, the foreign object is cleared and the engine  recovers rpm and continues to run unless stopped to prevent  further damage. While taxiing an aircraft, sudden reduction in  speed can occur when the propeller strikes a foreign object,  such as a raised section in the runway, a tool box, or a portion of  another airplane. When the accident occurs at high engine rpm,  shocks are much more severe. When sudden reduction in rpm  occurs, the following procedure can be used as a general rule,  but you must comply with the manufacturer’s information.  

Make a thorough external inspection of the engine mount,  crankcase, and nose section to determine whether any parts  have been damaged. If damage is found that cannot be  corrected by line maintenance, remove the engine. Internal  components can be damaged, especially counter weights on  the crankshaft.  

Remove the engine oil screens or filters. Inspect them for  the presence of metal particles. Remove the engine sump  plugs, drain the oil into a clean container, strain it through a  clean cloth, and check the cloth and the strained oil for metal  particles. Heavy metal particles in the oil indicate a definite  engine failure, and the engine must be removed. However, if  the metal particles present are similar to fine filings, continue  the inspection of the engine to determine its serviceability.  If there are no heavy metal particles in the engine oil, check  again for metal in the oil system after operating the engine.  Metal in the screens is a sign that the bearings have been  compromised and are in the process of failing.  

Remove the propeller and check the crankshaft, or the  propeller drive shaft on reduction-gear engines, for  misalignment. Clamp a test indicator to the nose section of the  engine. Use the dial-indicator that has  $\%,_{000}$  -inch graduations.  Remove the spark plugs from all the cylinders. Then, turn the  crankshaft, and observe if the crankshaft, propeller shaft, or  flange turns straight without any bending taking place. If there  is an excessive runout (bend in the crankshaft or propeller  flange) reading at the crankshaft or propeller-drive shaft at  the front seat location, the engine should be removed. Consult  the applicable manufacturer’s instructions for permissible  limits. If the crankshaft or propeller drive shaft runout does  not exceed these limits, install a serviceable propeller. Make  an additional check by tracking the propeller at the tip in the  same plane, perpendicular to the axis of rotation, to assure  that blade track tolerance is within the prescribed limits.  

Start the engine to see if operation is smooth, without vibration,  and the power output adequate. If the engine operates properly  during this ground check, shut the engine down and repeat the  inspection for metal particles in the oil system.  

# Metal Particles in the Oil  

Metal particles in the engine oil screens or the magnetic chip  detectors are generally an indication of partial internal failure  of the engine. Carbon tends to break loose from the interior  of the engine in rock-like pieces that have the appearance  of metal. It is necessary to consider these possibilities when  foreign particles are found on the engine oil screens or  magnetic chip detectors.  

Before removing an engine for suspected internal failure, as  indicated by foreign material on the oil screens or oil sump  plugs, determine if the foreign particles are ferrous metal by  placing them close to a magnet to see if they are magnetic. If  the material is not magnetic, it is not attracted by the magnet.  Any ferrous metal in the oil screens is cause for concern.  Very small amounts of nonferrous metal, especially after  major engine maintenance, can sometimes be normal. If the  particles are metal, determine the probable extent of internal  damage. For example, if only small particles are found that  are similar in nature to filings, drain the oil system, and refill  it. Then, ground-run the engine and reinspect the oil screens  and magnetic chip detectors. If no further evidence of foreign  material is found, continue the engine in service or per the  manufacturer’s instructions. However, engine performance  should be closely observed for any indication of difficulty  or internal failure.  

# Spectrometric Oil Analysis Engine Inspection  Program  

Spectrometric oil analysis program allows an oil sample  to be analyzed and searched for the presence of minute  metallic elements. Due to oil circulation throughout an  aircraft engine, every lubricant that is in service contains  microscopic particles of metallic elements called wear  metals. As the engine operates over a certain amount of time,  the oil picks up very small particles that stay suspended in  the oil. Oil analysis programs identify and measure these  particles in parts per million (PPM) by weight. The analyzed  elements are grouped into categories, such as wear metals  and additives, and their measurement in PPM provides the  data that expert analysts can use as one of many tools to  determine the engine’s condition. If certain metals have an  increase in PPM, it can be a signal of component wear or  pending failure of the engine. The amount of wear metals  is recorded and noted each time a sample is taken. If the  amount of wear metals increases beyond a normal rate, then  the operator can be notified quickly so repair, a recommended  specific maintenance procedure, or inspection can be ordered.  

The advantage of oil analysis is an increase in safety by  noticing an engine problem before engine failure. It also saves  money by finding engine problems before they become large  problems or complete engine failure. This procedure can be  used for both turbine and reciprocating engines. Oil analysis  can be used to diagnose impending engine failure and would  be a reason for removing the engine from the aircraft and  sending it to overhaul.  

# Turbine Engine Condition Monitoring Programs  

Many turbine engines are monitored by an engine condition  program that helps determine the health of the engine in  service. This can also be called trend analysis performance  monitoring, but it consists mainly of monitoring certain  engine parameters daily and watching for trend shifts or  changes in the engine parameters. A shift in key parameters  (change over time) could be a warning that the engine has  serious internal deterioration and should be overhauled.  

# Engine Operational Problems  

Engines are usually removed when there are consistent  engine operational problems. Engine operational problems  generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the  following conditions:  

1.	 Excessive engine vibration; this is especially true with  turbine engines. 2.	 Backfiring, or misfiring, either consistent or  intermittent due to valve train or other mechanical  defect in reciprocating engines. 3.	 Turbine engines that exceed normal operating  parameters or life limited components exceeding  maximum time in service or cycles. 4.	 Low power output, generally caused by low  compression, with reciprocating engines and internal  engine deterioration or damage with turbines.  

# General Procedures for Engine Removal &  Installation  

# Preparation of Engines for Installation  

After the decision has been made to remove an engine, the  preparation of the replacement engine must be considered.  The maintenance procedures and methods used vary widely.  Commercial operators, whose maintenance operations  require the most efficient and expeditious replacement of  aircraft engines, usually rely on a system that utilizes the  quick-engine-change assembly (QECA), also sometimes  referred to as the engine power package. The QECA is  essentially a powerplant and the necessary accessories  installed in the engine.  

Other operators of aircraft equipped with reciprocating  engines sometimes use a different replacement method in  these repair facilities because engine changes often occur  at random intervals. Such replacement engines may be  partially or wholly built up with the necessary accessories  and subassemblies, or they may be stored as received from  the manufacturer in packing boxes, cases, or cans and are  uncrated and built up for installation only when needed to  replace an engine.  

# QECA Buildup Method for Changing of Engines  

Because the QECA system is most commonly used with large  turbine engines used in the airlines, such engines are used to  describe QECA buildup and installation procedures. Many  of these procedures are applicable to all other methods of  engine buildup and installation.  

The following study of QECA buildup is not designed to  outline procedures to follow in a practical application;  always use those recommended by the manufacturer.  The procedures included in this chapter provide a logical  sequence in following a QECA and its components through  the stages of a typical buildup to gain a better understanding  of units and systems interconnection. The components of a

QECA are illustrated in  Figure 8-1.  As shown, the QECA  consists of several units. On many aircraft, the engines are  mounted in streamlined housings called nacelles that extend  from the wings. These nacelles are divided into two main  sections: wing nacelle and engine nacelle. The wing nacelle  is that portion of the nacelle that is attached to the wing  structure. The engine nacelle is that portion of the nacelle  that is constructed separately from the wing. Also, the wing  nacelles normally contain lines and units of the oil, fuel, and  hydraulic systems, as well as linkages and other controls for  the operation of the engine.  

The firewall is usually the foremost bulkhead of the engine  nacelle and differs from most other aircraft bulkheads in that  it is constructed of stainless steel or some other fire-resistant  material.  [Figure 8-2]  The primary purpose of the firewall is to  

![](images/45cc0c6c4594713a3a6f216a38a9176036af68c6225ed9abf295aa30d89352d0.jpg)

confine any engine fire to the engine nacelle. It also provides  a mounting surface for units within the engine nacelle and a  point of disconnect for lines, linkages, and electrical wiring  that are routed between the engine and the aircraft. Without  this firewall, an engine fire would have ready access to the  interior of the aircraft. Since the consequences of an engine  fire are obvious, the necessity of sealing all unused openings  in the firewall cannot be overstressed.  

An aircraft engine and its accessories that have been in  storage must undergo careful depreservation and inspection  before they may be installed in an aircraft. This involves  more than removing an engine from its container and bolting  it to the aircraft. If the engine is stored in a pressurized metal  container, the air valve should be opened to bleed off the  air pressure. Depending upon the size of the valve, the air  pressure should bleed off in somewhat less than 30 minutes.  

Prepare the container for opening by removing the bolts that  hold the two sections together. Then, attach a hoist to the  “hoisting points” and lift the top section clear of the container  and place it away from the work area. If the engine is installed  in a wooden shipping case, it is necessary to carefully break  the seal of the protective envelope and fold it down around  the engine. Remove the dehydrating agent or desiccant bags  and the humidity indicator from the outside of the engine.  Also, remove and set safely aside any accessories that are  not installed on the engine but are mounted on a special  stand or otherwise installed inside the protective envelope  with the engine.  

# Depreservation of an Engine  

After the engine has been secured to an engine stand, all  covers must be removed from the points where the engine was  sealed or closed with ventilatory covers, such as the engine  breathers, exhaust outlets, and accessory mounting-pad cover  plates. As each cover is removed, inspect the uncovered part  of the engine for signs of corrosion. Also, as the dehydrator  plugs are removed from each cylinder, make a very careful  check of the walls of any cylinder for which the dehydrator  plug color indicates an unsafe condition. Care is emphasized  in the inspection of the cylinders, even if it is necessary to  remove a cylinder.  

On radial engines, the inside of the lower cylinders and  intake pipes should be carefully checked for the presence of  excessive corrosion-preventive compound that has drained  from throughout the interior of the engine and settled at these  low points. This excessive compound could cause the engine  to become damaged from a hydraulic lock (also referred to  as liquid-lock) when a starting attempt is made.  

The check for excessive corrosion-preventive compound in  the cylinders of reciprocating engines can be made as the  dehydrator plugs are removed from each cylinder. Much of  the compound drains from the spark plug holes of the lower  cylinders of a radial engine when the dehydrator plugs are  removed. But some of the mixture remains in the cylinder head  below the level of the spark plug hole and can be removed  with a hand pump.  [Figure 8-3]  A more positive method is  to remove the lower intake pipes and open the intake valve  of the cylinder by rotating the crankshaft. This latter method  allows the compound to drain from the cylinder through the  open intake valve. If excessive compound is present in an  upper cylinder, it can be removed with a hand pump.  

The oil screens should be removed from the engine and  thoroughly washed in an approved solvent to remove all  accumulations that could restrict the oil circulation and cause  engine failure. After the screens are cleaned, immerse them  in clean oil and then reinstall them in the engine.  

When the cover has been removed from the intake area, the  silica gel desiccant bags (used to remove moisture from the  engine in storage) must be removed from the engine area. If  the engine uses a propeller, remove the protective covering  from the propeller shaft and wash all corrosion-preventive  compounds from both the inside and outside surfaces of the  shaft. Then, coat the propeller shaft lightly with engine oil.  Turbine engines require the removal of several covers on  many external areas on the engine.  

As a final check, see that the exterior of the engine is clean.  Usually a quantity of compound runs out of the engine when  the dehydrator plugs and oil screens are removed. To clean  the engine, spray it with an approved commercial solvent.

# Inspection & Depreservation of Accessories  

An engine’s performance is no better than that of its  accessories. Though the engine has been completely  overhauled and is in top condition, any oversight or error  in installing the accessories can result in improper engine  operation or even irreparable damage to it.  

Before depreserving any of the accessories enclosed with  the engine, consult the storage data usually stenciled on the  outside of the engine container or the records enclosed with  the engine to determine how long the engine and accessories  were in storage. Certain accessories that normally accompany  an engine from overhaul are considered unsafe for use if their  time in storage has exceeded a specified period. This time  varies according to the limits prescribed by the manufacturer.  

Any accessory that has been removed from an old engine that  can be installed on the new one must be given a thorough  inspection to determine its condition. This inspection  includes a check for general condition, cleanliness, absence  of corrosion, and absence of wear as evidenced by excessive  play in the moving parts.  

Some accessories must be replaced, regardless of their  operating time, if the engine is being changed because  of internal failure. Such accessories may have been  contaminated by metal particles carried into their operating  mechanisms by the engine oil that lubricates them.  

Before installing any replacement accessory, check it  visually for signs of corrosion and for freedom of operation.  Always wipe the mounting pad, flange, and coupling clean  before mounting the accessory, and install the proper gasket  between the mounting pad and the accessory mounting  flange. Lubricate the accessory drive shaft if so indicated in  the manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Inspection & Replacement of Powerplant  External Units & Systems  

The engine nacelle must be cleaned thoroughly before it is  inspected. The design of an engine nacelle varies with different  aircraft. Basically, it is a framework covered with removable  cowling, in which the engine is mounted. This assembly is  attached to the aircraft and incorporates an insulating firewall  between the engine and the airframe. The interconnecting  wiring, tubing, and linkages between the engine and its various  systems and controls pass through the firewall.  

Inspect the complete engine nacelle for condition of the  framework and the sheet-metal cowling and riveted plates  that cover the nacelle. The engine mounting frame assembly  should be checked for any distortion of the steel tubing, such  as bends, dents, flat spots, corrosion, or cracks. Use the dye  penetrant inspection method to reveal a crack, porous area,  or other defects.  

The engine mounting bolts are usually checked for condition  by magnetic particle inspection or other approved processes.  While the bolts are removed, the bolt holes should be checked  for elongation caused by the movement of an improperly  tightened bolt.  

Check the outer surface of all exposed electrical wiring for  breaks, chafing, or other damage. Also, check the security  of crimped or soldered cable ends. In addition, carefully  inspect connector plugs for overall condition. Any item that  is damaged must be repaired or replaced, depending on the  extent of the damage.  

Before installing an engine, inspect all tubing in the nacelle  for dents, nicks, scratches, chafing, or corrosion. Check all  tubing carefully for indications of fatigue or excessive flatness  caused by improper or accidental bending. Thoroughly  inspect all hoses used in various engine systems. Weather  checking (a cracking of the outside covering of the hose)  sometimes penetrates to the hose reinforcement. Replace any  length of hose that shows indications of the cover peeling or  flaking or has exposed fabric reinforcement. Replace a hose  that shows indications of excessive cold flow. Cold flow is  a term used to describe the deep and permanent impressions  or cracks caused by hose clamp pressure.  

Always replace a control rod if it is nicked or corroded  deeply enough to affect its strength. If the corrosion cannot  be removed by rubbing with steel wool, the pitting is too  deep for safety.  

On older aircraft, check the pulleys in the control system  for freedom of movement. It is easy to spot a pulley that is  not turning freely, for both it and the cable are worn from  the cable sliding over the pulley instead of rolling free. The  bearings of a pulley may be checked by inspecting the pulley  for excessive play or wobble with the tension removed from  the cable. The cable must also be inspected for corrosion  and broken strands. Locate any broken strands by wiping  the cable with a cloth.  

Check bonding for fraying, loose attachment, and cleanness  of terminal ends. The electrical resistance of the complete  bond must not exceed the resistance values specified in the  applicable manufacturer’s instructions.  

Inspect the exhaust stacks, collector ring, and tailpipe assembly  for security, cracks, or excessive corrosion. Depending on the  installation, these units, or parts of them, may be mounted on  the engine before it is installed in the aircraft.  

Check all air ducts for dents and for the condition of the  fabric or rubber anti-chafing strips at the points where  sections of duct are joined. The dents may be pounded out;  the anti-chafing strips should be replaced if they are pulled  loose from the duct or are worn to the point at which they  no longer form a tight seal at the joint.  

Thoroughly inspect the engine oil system and perform any  required special maintenance upon it before installing a  replacement engine. If an engine is being changed at the end  of its normal time in service, it is usually necessary only to  flush the oil system; however, if an engine has been removed  for internal failure, usually some units of the oil system must  be replaced and others thoroughly cleaned and inspected.  

If the engine has been removed because of internal failure,  the oil tank is generally removed to permit thorough cleaning.  Also, the oil cooler and temperature regulator must be  removed and sent to a repair facility for overhaul. The vacuum  pump pressure line and the oil separator in the vacuum system  must also be removed, cleaned, and inspected. Internal failure  also requires that the propeller governor and feathering pump  mechanism be replaced if these units are operated by engine  oil pressure.  

# Preparing the Engine for Removal  

Before starting to work on the aircraft or reciprocating engine,  always be sure that the magneto switch is in the off position.  Aircraft engines can be started accidentally by turning the  propeller if the magneto switch is on.  

Check to see that all fuel selectors or solenoid-operated fuel  shutoff valves are closed. The fuel selector valves are either  manually or solenoid operated. If solenoid-operated fuel  shutoff valves are installed, it may be necessary to turn the  battery switch on before the valves can be closed, since the  solenoid depends on electricity for operation. These valves  close the fuel line at the firewall between the engine and the  aircraft. After ensuring that all fuel to the engine is shut off,  disconnect the battery to eliminate the possibility of a hot  wire starting a fire. If it is anticipated that the aircraft will  be out of service for more than 6 days, the battery is usually  removed and taken to the battery shop and placed on charge.  

Also, a few other preparations should be made before starting  to work on the engine removal. First, make sure that there are  enough fire extinguishers near at hand to meet any possible  emergency. Check the seals on these extinguishers to be sure  the extinguishers have not been discharged. Then, check  the wheel chocks. If these are not in place, the aircraft can,  and probably will, inch forward or back during some crucial  operation. Also, if the aircraft has a tricycle landing gear, be  sure that the tail is supported so that the aircraft cannot tip back  when the weight of the engine is removed from the forward  end. It is not necessary to support the tail on some multiengine  aircraft if only one engine is to be removed. In addition, the  landing gear shock struts can be deflated to prevent them from  extending as the engine weight is removed from the aircraft.  

After taking these necessary precautions, begin removing the  cowling from around the engine. As it is removed, clean it and  check for cracks so that the necessary repairs can be made  while the engine change is in progress. Place all cowling that  does not need repair on a rack where it can be readily found  when the time comes to reinstall it on the new engine. After  removing the cowling, the propeller should be removed for  inspection or repair.  

# Draining the Engine  

Place a large metal pan (drip pan) on the floor under the  engine to catch any spilled mixture or oil. Next, secure a clean  container in which to drain the oil or corrosion-preventive  mixture. Place the container beneath the engine, open the  drain valve, and allow the oil to drain.  Figure 8-4  shows the  points at which a typical aircraft engine oil system is drained.  Other points at which the oil system is drained can typically  include the oil cooler, oil return line, and engine sumps.  All valves, drains, and lines must remain open until the oil  system has been completely drained. After draining the oil,  reinstall all drain plugs and close all drain valves. Then, wipe  all excess oil from around the drain points.  

# Electrical Disconnects  

Electrical disconnections are usually made at the engine  firewall. When the basic engine is being removed, the  electrical leads to such accessories as the starter and  generators are disconnected at the units themselves. When  

![](images/4ad1a85a36d91c4d4c093b24fe1edd1b3f31b95ce3f60283fc907d87a4a15e90.jpg)  
Figure 8-4.   Oil system drain points.  

disconnecting electrical leads, it is a good safety habit to  disconnect the magnetos first and immediately ground them  at some point on the engine or the assembly being removed.  Most firewall disconnections of electrical conduit and cable  are simplified by use of (Army/Navy) AN or (Military  Standard) MS connectors. Each connector consists of two  parts: a plug assembly and a receptacle assembly. To prevent  accidental disconnection during airplane operation, the outlet  is threaded to permit a knurled sleeve nut to be screwed to  the outlet and then fastened with safety wire, if necessary.  

A typical plug fitting assembly is shown in  Figure 8-5.  It  also shows a typical junction box assembly, which is used as  a disconnect on some aircraft engine installations. After the  safety wire is broken, remove all of it from the sleeve nuts that  hold the conduit to the junction boxes, as well as from the nuts  on the connectors. Wrap moisture proof tape over the exposed  ends of connectors to protect them from dirt and moisture.  Also, do not leave long electrical cables or conduits hanging  loose, since they may become entangled with some part of the  aircraft while the engine is being hoisted. It is a good practice  to coil all lengths of cable or flexible conduit neatly, and tie  

![](images/a9bfa7d086301db6a54a791072dee9924dbcd954fe9c33743f4d757e1c4b8f59.jpg)  
Figure 8-5.   Electrical connections.  

# Disconnection of Engine Controls  

The engine control rods and cables connect such units as  the carburetor or fuel control throttle valve and the mixture  control valve with their manually actuated control in the flight  deck. The controls are sometimes disconnected by removing  the turnbuckle that joins the cable ends.  [Figure 8-6]  A typical  reciprocating engine control linkage consisting of a control  rod attached to a bell crank is illustrated in  Figure 8-7.  

The control rod in the linkage shown has two rod-end  assemblies, a clevis, and an eye screwed onto opposite ends.  These rod-end assemblies determine the length of the control  rod by the distance they are screwed onto it, and they are  locked into position by check nuts. An antifriction bearing is  usually mounted in the eye end of a rod. This eye is slipped  over a bolt in the bell crank arm and is held in position by  a castle nut safety with a cotter pin. The clevis rod end is  slipped over the end of a bell crank arm, which also usually  contains an antifriction bearing. A bolt is passed through the  clevis and the bell crank eye, fastened with a castle nut, and  safetied with a cotter pin. Most control rod ends are provided  with a test hole in the shank for inspection. If safety wire can  be inserted through the test hole, the terminal is not being  held by the required number of threads.  

Sometimes linkage assemblies do not include the antifriction  bearings and are held in position only by a washer and cotter  pin in the end of a clevis pin that passes through the bell  crank and rod end. After the engine control linkages have  been disconnected, the nuts and bolts should be replaced in  the rod ends or bell crank arms to prevent their being lost.  All control rods should be removed completely or tied back  to prevent them from being bent or broken if they are struck  by the replacement engine or QECA as it is being hoisted.

Figure 8-8.   Types of line disconnects.  

# Disconnection of Lines  

The lines between units within the aircraft and the engine  are either flexible hose or aluminum-alloy tubes joined by  lengths of hose clamped to them. Lines that must withstand  high pressure, such as hydraulic lines, are often made of  stainless steel tubing.  

Figure 8-8  shows the basic types of line disconnects. Most  lines leading from a QECA are secured to a threaded fitting  at the firewall by a sleeve nut around the tubing. Hoses are  sometimes secured in this manner but may also be secured  by a threaded fitting on the unit to which they lead, or by a  hose clamp. The firewall fittings for some lines have a quick- disconnect fitting that contains a check valve to prevent the  system from losing fluid when the line is disconnected. Metal  tubing on some installations may also be disconnected at a  point at which two lengths of it are joined together by a length  of rubber hose. Such a disconnection is made by loosening  the hose clamps and sliding the length of rubber hose over  the length of tubing that remains on the aircraft. There may  be some further variations in these types of disconnections,  but they follow the same basic pattern.  

Some type of a container should be used to collect any fuel,  oil, or other fluid that may drain from the disconnected lines. After the lines have drained, they should be immediately  plugged or covered with moisture-proof tape to prevent  foreign matter from entering them, as well as to prevent any  accumulated fluid from dripping out.  

# Other Disconnections  

The points at which the various air ducts are disconnected  depend upon the engine and the aircraft in which it is  installed. Usually, the air intake ducts and the exhaust system  must be disconnected so the basic engine or the QECA can  be removed. After the engine connections are free (except  the engine mounts) and all the disconnections are entirely  clear so they do not bind or become entangled, the engine  can be prepared for hoisting.  

# Removing the Engine  

If a QECA is being removed, the engine mount accompanies  the engine. The mount remains on the aircraft if only the  engine is being removed. Before the engine can be freed  from its attachment points, a sling must be installed so the  engine’s weight can be supported with a hoist when the  mounting bolts are removed.  

Aircraft engines, or QECAs, have marked points for attaching  

![](images/efc698482dc12b46be94aa15174fdcd87b4f37daa7cd96720afa50bcdcb3721a.jpg)  
Figure 8-9.   Hoisting sling attached to engine.  

a hoisting sling. The location of these attaching points varies  according to the size and weight distribution of the engine.  Figure 8-9  shows a sling supporting an engine that has two  attaching points. As a matter of safety, carefully inspect the  sling for condition before installing it on the engine.  

Before attaching the sling to the hoist, be sure that the hoist  has sufficient capacity to lift the engine safely. The engine’s  center of gravity (CG) should also be taken into account as  the engine is hoisted. A manually operated hoist mounted in a  

![](images/386aec9f0c7b785cfc4e57fc2bc21262552e235ac470202d854da66ced9403d9.jpg)  
Figure 8-10.   Hoist and frame assembly used for engine removal.  

portable frame is shown in  Figure 8-10.  This hoist assembly  is specifically manufactured for the purpose of removing  engines and other large assemblies from aircraft. Some  frames are fitted with power-operated hoists. These should  be used with care, since considerable damage can be done  if an inexperienced operator allows a power-operated hoist  to overrun. The hoist and frame should also be checked for  condition before being used to lift the engine.  

# Hoisting the Engine  

Before the hoist is hooked onto the engine sling, recheck the  aircraft tail supports and the wheel chocks. Fasten lines to the  engine, at points on the sides or rear, so that the engine can  be controlled as it is being hoisted. Hook the hoist onto the  sling and hoist the engine just enough to relieve the engine  weight from the mount attachments. Remove the nuts from  the mount attachments in the order recommended in the  manufacturer’s instructions for the aircraft. As the last nuts  are being removed, pull back on the lines fastened to the  engine (or force it back by other means if lines are not being  used), thus steadying the engine. If bolts must be removed  from the mount attachments, be sure the engine is under  control before doing so. If the bolts are to remain in the mount  attachments, the hoist can be gently maneuvered upward or  downward as necessary after all the nuts have been removed.  Meanwhile, gently relax the backward force on the engine  just enough to allow the engine gradual forward movement  when it is free from the mount attachments. When the hoist  has removed all engine weight from the mount attachments,  the engine should be eased gently forward, away from the  aircraft. If the engine binds at any point, maneuver it with  the hoist until it slips free.  

The procedure just discussed applies to removal of most  reciprocating and turbine aircraft engines. Any variation  in details is outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions.  Before attempting any engine removal, always consult these  instructions for the aircraft concerned. When the engine has  been removed, it can be carefully lowered onto a stand. The  engine should be fastened to the stand and prepared for the  removal of accessories.  

# Hoisting & Mounting the Engine for Installation  

When the new or overhauled engine is ready to be hoisted  for installation, move the engine stand as close as possible  to the nacelle in which the replacement is to be installed.  Then, attach the sling to the engine and hook the hoist to the  sling. Take up the slack until the hoist is supporting most of  the engine weight. Next, remove the engine attaching bolts  from the stand and hoist the engine clear.  

The engine stand may be moved and the hoist frame  positioned so the engine can be hoisted easily into the nacelle.  

To prevent injury to the crew or damage to the aircraft or  engine, be sure that the engine is steadied when moving the  hoist frame.  

Engine nacelles are rarely designed for the engine to be  fitted and bolted into place as though it were being mounted  on a bare wall. The engine must be guided into position and  mated with its various connections, such as the mounting  bolt holes and the exhaust tailpipe. This must be done despite  such obstacles as the nacelle framework, ducts, or firewall  connections and without leaving a trail of broken and bent  parts, scratched paint, or crushed fingers.  

When the engine has been aligned correctly in the nacelle,  insert the mounting bolts into their holes and start all  of the nuts on them. Always use the type of bolt and  nut recommended by the manufacturer. Never use an  unauthorized substitution of a different type or specification  of nut and bolt than that prescribed.  

The nuts on the engine mount bolts must be tightened to the  torque recommended by the aircraft manufacturer. While the  nuts are being tightened, the hoist should support the engine  weight sufficiently to allow alignment of the mounting bolts.  If the engine is permitted to exert upward or downward  pressure on the bolts, it is necessary for the nuts to pull the  engine into proper alignment. This results in nuts being  tightened to the proper torque value without actually holding  the engine securely to the aircraft.  

The applicable manufacturer’s instructions outline the  sequence for tightening the mounting bolts to ensure security  of fastening. After the nuts are safetied and the engine sling  and hoist are removed, bonding strips should be connected  across each engine mount to provide an electrical path from  the mount to the airframe.  

Mounting the engine in the nacelle is, of course, only the  beginning. All the ducts, electrical leads, controls, tubes, and  conduits must be connected before the engine can be operated.  

# Connections & Adjustments  

There are no hard-and-fast rules that direct the order in which  units or systems should be connected to the engine. Each  maintenance organization normally supplies a worksheet  or checklist to be followed during this procedure. This list  is based upon past engine installations on each particular  aircraft. If this is followed carefully, it serves as a guide for  an efficient installation. The following instructions are not a  sequence of procedures but a discussion of correct methods  for completing an engine installation.  

The system of ducts for routing air to the engine varies with  all types of aircraft. In connecting them, the goal is to fit the  ducts closely at all points of disconnect so that the air they  route does not escape its intended path. The duct systems of  some aircraft must be pressure checked for leaks. This is done  by blocking the system at one end, supplying compressed air  at a specified pressure at the other end, and then checking  the rate of leakage.  

The filters in the air induction system must be cleaned to  ensure an unrestricted flow of clean air to the engine and  its units. Because methods for cleaning air filters vary with  the materials used in the filtering element, clean them in  accordance with the technical instructions for the aircraft  being serviced.  

The exhaust system should also be carefully connected  to prevent the escape of hot gases into the nacelle. When  assembling the exhaust system, check all clamps, nuts,  and bolts, and replace any in doubtful condition. During  assembly, the nuts should be gradually and progressively  tightened to the correct torque. The clamps should be tapped  with a rawhide mallet as they are being tightened to prevent  binding at any point. On some systems, a ball joint connects  the stationary portion of the exhaust system to the portion  that is attached to the engine. This ball joint absorbs the  normal engine movement caused by the unbalanced forces  of the engine operation. Ball joints must be installed with  the specified clearance to prevent binding when expanded  by hot exhaust gases.  

Hoses used inside low-pressure systems are generally  fastened into place with clamps. Before using a hose clamp,  inspect it for security of welding or riveting and for smooth  operation of the adjusting screw. A clamp that is badly  distorted or materially defective should be rejected. Material  defects include extremely brittle or soft areas that may easily  break or stretch when the clamp is tightened. After a hose is  installed in a system, it should be supported with rubber-lined  supporting clamps at regular intervals.  

Before installing metal tubing with threaded fittings, ensure  the threads are clean and in good condition. Apply sealing  compound, of the correct specification for the system, to  the threads of the fittings before installing them. While  connecting metal tubing, follow the same careful procedure  for connecting hose fittings to prevent cross-threading and  to ensure correct torque.  

When connecting the starter, generator, or various other  electrical units within the nacelle, make sure that all lead  connections are clean and properly secured. On leads that  are fastened to a threaded terminal with a nut, a lock washer  is usually inserted under the nut to prevent the lead from  working loose. When required, connector plugs can be  safetied with steel wire to hold the knurled nut in the full- tight position.  

Electrical leads within the engine nacelle are usually passed  through either flexible or rigid conduit. The conduit must be  anchored, as necessary, to provide a secure installation and  bonded when required.  

All engine controls must be accurately adjusted to ensure  instantaneous response to the control setting. For flexibility,  the engine controls are usually a combination of rods and  cables. Since these controls are tailored to the model of  aircraft in which they are installed, their adjustment must  follow exactly the step-by-step procedure outlined in the  manufacturer’s instructions for each particular model  of aircraft.  

Figure 8-11  illustrates a simplified schematic drawing of a  throttle control system for a reciprocating aircraft engine.  Follow a general procedure for adjusting throttle controls.  First, loosen the serrated throttle control arm at the carburetor  and back off the throttle stop until the throttle valve is in  the fully closed position. After locking the cable drum into  position with the locking pin, adjust the control rod to a  specified length. Then, attach one end of the control rod to  the locked cable drum, and reinstall the throttle control arm  on the carburetor in the serrations that allow the other end of  the control rod to be attached to it. This correctly connects  the control arm to the cable drum.  

Now, loosen the cable turnbuckles until the throttle control  can be locked at the quadrant with the locking pin. Then, with  both locking pins in place, adjust the cables to the correct  tension as measured with a tensiometer. Remove the locking  pins from the cable drum and quadrant.  

Next, adjust the throttle control so that it has a slight cushion  action at two positions on the throttle quadrant: one when  the carburetor throttle valve is in the full-open position and  the other when it is closed to the idle position (stop to stop).  

Adjust the cushion by turning the cable turnbuckles equally  in opposite directions until the throttle control cushion is  correct at the full-open position of the throttle valve. Then,  when the throttle arm stop is adjusted to the correct idle speed  

![](images/348deb769564e4821721da25e4e778d4e40c28f32057db35ae2627710fb84e0d.jpg)  
Figure 8-11.   Schematic drawing of throttle control system.  

setting, the amount of cushion should be within tolerance at  the idle speed position of the throttle valve. The presence of  this cushion ensures that the travel of the throttle valve is not  limited by the stops on the throttle control quadrant, but that  they are opening fully and closing to the correct idle speed  as determined by the throttle arm stop.  

Adjustment of the engine controls is basically the same on all  aircraft regarding the linkage adjustment to a predetermined  length for a specific setting of the unit to be controlled. Then  adjust cables, if used in the control system, to a specific  tension with the control system locked. Finally, the full  travel of the unit to be controlled is ensured by establishing  the correct cushion in the controls. In general, the same basic  procedure is used to connect the linkage of the remaining  engine controls. After rigging the engine controls, safety the  turnbuckles and castle nuts, and make certain the jam nuts  on all control rods are tightened.  

On multiengine aircraft, the amount of cushion of all engine  controls on each quadrant must be equal so that all are  aligned at any specific setting chosen. This eliminates the  necessity of setting each control individually to synchronize  engine operations.  

After the engine has been installed, it is necessary to adjust  the cowl flaps, if installed, so that the passage of the cooling  air over the engine can be regulated accurately. Operate the  system and recheck for opening and closing to the specified  limits. Also, check the cowl flap position indicators, if  installed, to ensure that they indicate the true position of the  cowl flaps. Cowl flaps are doors at the bottom of the rear  cowling that are used to control air flow through the cowling.  

The oil cooler doors are adjusted in a manner similar to that  used to adjust the cowl flaps. In some cases, the procedure  is reversed in so far as the door is first adjusted to retract to  a specified point, and the limit switch on the motor is set to  cut out at this point. Then, the jackscrew is adjusted to permit  the door to open only a specified distance, and the open limit  switch is set to stop the motor when this point is reached.  

After the engine has been completely installed and connected,  install the propeller on the aircraft. Before doing so, the thrust  bearing retaining nut should be checked for correct torque. If  required, the propeller shaft must be coated with light engine  oil before the propeller is installed; the propeller governor and  anti-icing system must be connected according to applicable  manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Preparation of Engine for Ground & Flight  Testing  

# Pre-Oiling  

Before the new engine is flight tested, it must undergo a  thorough ground check. Before this ground check can be  made, several operations are usually performed on the engine.  

To prevent failure of the engine bearings during the initial  start, the engine should be pre-oiled. When an engine  has been idle for an extended period of time, its internal  bearing surfaces are likely to become dry at points where  the corrosion-preventive mixture has dried out or drained  away from the bearings. Hence, it is necessary to force oil  throughout the entire engine oil system. If the bearings are dry  when the engine is started, the friction at high rpm destroys  the bearings before lubricating oil from the engine-driven oil  pump can reach them.  

There are several methods of pre-oiling an engine. The  method selected should provide an expeditious and adequate  pre-oiling service. Before using any pre-oiling method,  remove one spark plug from each cylinder to allow the engine  to be turned over more easily with the starter. Also, connect  an external source of electrical power (auxiliary power unit)  to the aircraft electrical system to prevent an excessive drain  on the aircraft battery.  

In using some types of pre-oilers, such as that shown in  Figure 8-12,  the oil line from the inlet side of the engine- driven oil pump must be disconnected to permit the pre-oiler  tank to be connected at this point. Then, a line must be  disconnected, or an opening made in the oil system at the  nose of the engine, to allow oil to flow out of the engine.  Oil flowing out of the engine indicates the completion of the  pre-oiling operation, since the oil has now passed through  the entire system.  

![](images/3797888b9e39e5934423d24cd265d3496812fed21323c694e9d044394df43591.jpg)  
Figure 8-12.   Pre-oiler tank.  

In order to force oil from the pre-oiler tank through the  engine, apply air pressure to the oil in the tank while the  engine is being turned through with the starter. When this  action has forced oil through the disconnection at the nose  of the engine, stop cranking the engine and disconnect the  pre-oiler tank. A motor-driven oil pump can also be used to  pump oil through the engine during the pre-oiling operation.  

When no external means of pre-oiling an engine are available,  the engine oil pump may be used. Fill the engine oil tank,  or crankcase, to the proper level. Then, with the mixture  in the idle cutoff position (reciprocating engine), the fuel  shutoff valve and ignition switches in the off position, and  the throttles fully open, crank the engine with the starter  until the oil pressure gauge mounted on the instrument panel  indicates oil pressure.  

After the engine has been pre-oiled, replace the spark plugs  and connect the oil system. Generally, the engine should be  operated within 4 hours of being pre-oiled; otherwise, the  pre-oiling procedure normally must be repeated.  

# Fuel System Bleeding  

To purge the fuel system of air locks, and to aid in flushing  any traces of preservative oil from a pressure carburetor,  fuel injector unit, or fuel control (turbine), remove the drain  plug in the fuel unit chamber that is farthest from the fuel  inlet to the fuel unit. In its place, screw a threaded fitting to  a length of hose leading to a suitable container. Then, set  the fuel control unit to flow fuel so that fuel is permitted to  flow through the system. After ensuring the fuel shutoff and  main fuel tank valves are open, turn on the fuel boost pump  until there are no traces of preservative oil in the fuel being  pumped through the system. The passage of air is indicated  by the absence of air mixed in the fuel emerging from the end  of the hose submerged in the container of fuel. Air trapped in  the system should not be confused with the numerous small  air bubbles that may appear as a result of the velocity of the  fuel being ejected from the engine’s fuel unit. Usually, after  approximately a gallon of fuel has been bled off, the system  can be considered safe for operation. After completing the  bleeding operation, return all switches and controls to their  normal, or off, position, and replace and safety all fuel unit  connections disturbed.  

# Propeller Check  

The propeller, if equipped, must be checked before, during,  and after the engine has been ground operated. The propeller  should be checked for proper torque on the mounting bolts,  leaks, vibration, and for correct safety.  

A propeller whose pitch-changing mechanism is electrically  actuated may be checked before the engine is operated.  Propellers whose pitch-changing mechanisms are oil actuated  must be checked during engine operation after the normal  operating oil temperature has been reached. In addition to  checking the increase or decrease in rpm, the feathering cycle  of the propeller should also be checked.  

# Checks & Adjustments After Engine Runup &  Operation  

After the engine has been ground operated, and again after  flight test, operational factors must be adjusted, as necessary,  and the entire installation given a thorough visual inspection.  These adjustments often include fuel pressure and oil pressure,  as well as rechecks of such factors as ignition timing, valve  clearances, and idle speed and mixture. If these rechecks are  indicated by the manner in which the engine performs.  

After both the initial ground runup and the test flight, remove  the oil sump plugs and screens and inspect for metal particles.  Clean the screens before reinstalling them.  

Check all lines for leakage and security of attachment.  Especially, check the oil system hose clamps for security  as evidenced by oil leakage at the hose connections. Also,  inspect the cylinder holddown nuts or cap screws for security  and safety. This check should also be performed after the  flight immediately succeeding the test flight.  

# Rigging, Inspections, & Adjustments  

The following instructions cover some of the basic  inspections and procedures for rigging and adjusting fuel  controls, fuel selectors, and fuel shutoff valves.  

1.	 Inspect all bellcranks for looseness, cracks, or  corrosion. 2.	 Inspect rod ends for damaged threads and the number  of threads remaining after final adjustment.  3.	 Inspect cable drums for wear and cableguards for  proper position and tension.  

While rigging the fuel selector, power controls, and shutoff  valve linkages, follow the manufacturer’s step-by-step  procedure for the particular aircraft model being rigged.  The cables should be rigged with the proper tension with  the rigging pins installed. The pins should be free to be  removed without any binding; if they are hard to remove, the  cables are not rigged properly and should be rechecked. The  power lever should have the proper cushion at the idle and  full-power positions. The pointers, or indicators, on the fuel  control should be within limits. The fuel selectors must be  rigged so that they have the proper travel and do not restrict  the fuel flow to the engines.  

# Rigging Power Controls  

Many older conventional turbofan engines use various power  lever control systems. One of the common types is the cable  and rod system. This system uses bellcranks, push-pull rods,  drums, fairleads, flexible cables, and pulleys. All of these  components make up the control system and must be adjusted  or rigged from time to time. On single-engine aircraft, the  rigging of the power lever controls is not very difficult. The  basic requirement is to have the desired travel on the power  lever and correct travel at the fuel control. On multiengine  turbojet aircraft, the power levers must be rigged so that they  are aligned at all power settings.  

Most computer controlled engines have an electronic  connection from the flight deck to the engine. This eliminates  the need for any type of cable or linkages. In the computer  controlled system, the computer sends electronic information  through wires or buses to the fuel control to command it to  follow pilot inputs from the flight deck.  

On older style aircraft the power lever control cables and  push-pull rods in the airframe system to the pylon and nacelle  are not usually disturbed at engine change time and usually  no rigging is required, except when some component has  been changed. The control system from the pylon to the  engine must be rigged after each engine change and fuel  control change.  Figure 8-13  shows the control system from  the bellcrank in the upper pylon to the fuel control.  

Before adjusting the power controls at the engine, be sure  that the power lever is free from binding and the controls  have full throw on the console. If they do not have full throw  or are binding, the airframe system should be checked, and  the discrepancies repaired. After all adjustments have been  

![](images/9f4a620bdafa47fd6b1ce1527d6457dbf1c5f461f7d1a5442938830a63c1b7a0.jpg)  
Figure 8-13.   Power lever control system.  

made, move the power levers through their complete range,  carefully inspecting for adequate clearance between the  various push-pull rods and tubes. Secure all locknuts, cotter  pins, and safety as required.  

# Adjusting the Fuel Control  

The fuel control unit of the typical turbofan on older aircraft  can be a hydromechanical device that schedules the quantity  of fuel flowing to the engine so that the desired amount of  thrust can be obtained. The amount of thrust is dictated by the  position of the power lever in the flight deck and the particular  operation of the engine. Thus, the thrust of the engine and  the consequent rpm of its turbine are scheduled by fuel flow.  

The fuel control unit of the engine is adjusted to trim the  engine to obtain maximum thrust output of the engine when  desired. The engine must be retrimmed after a fuel control  unit is replaced, the engine does not develop maximum thrust,  engine change, or excessive throttle stagger.  

After trimming the engine, the idle rpm can be adjusted.  The idle rpm is adjusted by turning the INC. IDLE screw an  eighth of a turn at a time, allowing sufficient time for the rpm  to stabilize between adjustments. Retard the power lever to  idle and recheck the idle rpm.  

If wind velocity is a factor, the aircraft should be headed  into the wind while trimming or checking the trim on an  engine. Since trimming accuracy decreases as windspeed  and moisture content increase, the most accurate trimming is  obtained under conditions of no wind and clear, moisture-free  air. Do not trim when there is a tailwind because hot exhaust  gases may be reingested. As a practical matter, the engine  should never be trimmed when icing conditions exist because  of the adverse effects on trimming accuracy. To obtain the  most accurate results, the aircraft should always be headed  into the wind while the engine is being trimmed.  

With the aircraft headed into the wind, verify that the exhaust  area is clear. Install an engine trim gauge to the T-fitting in the  turbine discharge pressure line. Start the engine and allow it  to stabilize for 5 minutes before attempting to adjust the fuel  control. Refer to the applicable manufacturer’s instructions  for correct trim values. Compensate for temperature and  pressure during the trimming process. If a hydromechanical  fuel control is not within limits, turn the INC. MAX screw  [Figure 8-14]  about one-eighth turn in the appropriate  direction. Repeat, if necessary, until the desired value is  attained. If the aircraft is equipped with a pressure ratio gauge,  set it to the correct value.  

An example of a trim check using an electronic controlled  fuel control must take into account temperature and pressure  

![](images/5957da17a09c37127fa4691f6a7fe9d6a7718b4f64bda12d30195faf342e5c39.jpg)  
Figure 8-14.   Typical fuel control adjustments.  

for each parameter measured. The parameters checked can  include:  

1. 	 Minimum idle (percent  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$  ). 2. 	 Approach idle (percent  $\mathbf{N}_{2}$  ). 3. 	 2.5 bleed open (percent  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$  ). 4. 	 2.5 bleed closed (percent  $\mathbf{N}_{1}$  ). 5. 	 Takeoff engine pressure ratio (EPR). 6. 	 95 percent takeoff thrust (EPR). 7. 	 90 percent thrust change decal (EPR).  

The actual trim check would be done based on a temperature  and pressure, such as the example in  Figure 8-15.  For these  given temperature and pressures, the target parameter values can be derived from a chart in the manufacturer’s manual.  The engine is run up, and these values are checked against  the tolerances given in the manual.  

# Turboprop Powerplant Removal & Installation  

Since most turboprop powerplant removal and installation  instructions are developed for QECA, the following procedures  reflect those used for a typical QECA. The procedures for  turboprop engine removal and installation are similar to those  presented in the section of this chapter for turbojet engines,  except for those systems related to the turboprop propeller.  

Open the engine side panels and remove the nacelle access  panels. Disconnect the engine thermocouple leads at the  terminal board. Before disconnecting any lines, make sure  that all fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid valves are closed. Plug  all lines as they are disconnected to prevent entrance of  foreign material.  

Remove the clamps securing the bleed-air ducts at the firewall.  Then, disconnect the electrical connector plugs, engine  breather and vent lines, and fuel, oil, and hydraulic lines.  

Disconnect the engine power lever and propeller control rods  or cables. Remove the covers from the QECA lift points,  attach the QECA sling, and remove slack from the cables  using a suitable hoist. The sling must be adjusted to position  the hoisting eye over the QECA CG. Failure to do so may  result in engine damage.  

Remove the engine mount bolts. The QECA is then ready to  be removed. Recheck all of the disconnect points to make  certain they are all disconnected prior to moving the engine.  Move the engine forward, out of the nacelle structure, until  it clears the aircraft. Lower the QECA into position on the  QECA stand and secure it prior to removing the engine sling.  

The installation procedures are essentially the reverse of  the removal procedures. Move the QECA straight back into  the nacelle structure and align the mount bolt holes and the  firewall. Start all the bolts before torqueing. With all the  bolts started, and using the correct torque wrench adapter,  tighten the mount bolts to their proper torque. Remove the  sling and install the access covers at the lift point. Using  the reverse of the removal procedures, connect the various  lines and connectors. New O-ring seals should be used.  The manufacturer’s instructions should be consulted for the  proper torque limits for the various clamps and bolts.  

After installation, an engine runup should be made. In  general, the runup consists of checking proper operation of  the powerplant and related systems. Several functional tests  are performed to evaluate each phase of engine operation.  The tests and procedures outlined by the engine or airframe  manufacturers should be followed.  

# Reciprocating Helicopter Engine & QECA  

The engine is installed facing aft with the propeller shaft  approximately  $39^{\circ}$   above horizontal. The engine is supported  by the engine mount, which is bolted to the fuselage structure.  The installation of the engine provides for ease of maintenance  by allowing easy access to all accessories and components  when the engine access doors are opened. The QECA contains  the engine, engine mount, engine accessories, engine controls,  fuel system, lubrication system, ignition system, cooling  system, and hydromechanical clutch and fan assembly.  

![](images/9f4b4afc92dffeb3e871431efc3c87b90da1c6135b5d29fe614ab6d8b7a869c0.jpg)  
Figure 8-15.   Trim check data (Boeing).  

# Removal of Helicopter QECA  

Prior to removing the helicopter QECA, the engine should  be preserved if it is possible to do so. Then, shut off the  fuel supply to the engine and drain the oil. Make the  disconnections necessary to remove the QECA, and then  perform the following steps:  

1.	 Attach the engine lifting sling to a hoist of at least a  two-ton capacity. 2.	 Raise the hoist to apply a slight lift to the QECA.  Loosen both engine mount lower attachment bolt nuts  before leaving the upper attachment bolts. 3.	 Remove the bolts from the sway braces and remove  both engine upper attachment bolts. Then, remove  both engine mount lower attachment bolts and remove  the QECA from the helicopter. Mount the power  package in a suitable workstand and remove the sling.  

# Installation, Rigging, & Adjustment of Helicopter  QECA  

The installation of a new or an overhauled engine is in reverse  of the removal procedure. The manufacturer’s instructions  for the helicopter must be consulted to ascertain the correct  interchange of parts from the old engine to the new engine.  The applicable maintenance instructions should be followed.  Refer to the Maintenance Instructions Manual and associated  technical publications for detailed information concerning  rigging the throttle, mixture control, cable tensions, and  related data.  

# Testing the Engine Installation  

Normal engine run-in procedures must be followed in  accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. A flight  test is usually performed after the engine has been installed  and the engine controls have been adjusted.  

# Engine Mounts  

# Mounts for Reciprocating Engines  

Most aircraft equipped with reciprocating engines use an  engine mount structure made of welded steel tubing. The  mount is constructed in one or more sections that incorporate  the engine mount ring, bracing members (V-struts), and  fittings for attaching the mount to the wing nacelle.  

![](images/4abcd96f2bd3db4683ab5572f538a32a2508b5b7ec5a9e030028471c9bcbf438.jpg)  
Figure 8-16.   Engine mounting ring.  

The engine mounts are usually secured to the aircraft by  special heat-treated steel bolts. The importance of using only  these special bolts can be readily appreciated, since they  alone support the entire weight of, and withstand all, the  stresses imposed by the engine and propeller in flight. The  upper bolts support the weight of the engine while the aircraft  is on the ground, but when the aircraft is airborne another  stress is added. This stress is torsional and affects all bolts,  not just the top bolts. A typical engine mount ring shown in  Figure 8-16  discloses fittings and attachment points located  at four positions on the engine mount structure. Each fitting  houses a dynamic engine mount.  

The section of an engine mount where the engine is attached  is known as the engine mount ring. It is usually constructed  of steel tubing having a larger diameter than the rest of the  mount structure. It is circular in shape so that it can surround  the engine, which is near the point of balance for the engine.  The engine is usually attached to the mount by dynafocal  mounts, attached to the engine at the point of balance forward  of the mount ring. Other types of mounting devices are also  used to secure the different engines to their mount rings.  

As aircraft engines became larger and produced more power,  some method was needed to absorb their vibration. This  demand led to the development of the rubber and steel engine- suspension units called shock mounts. This combination  permits restricted engine movement in all directions. These  vibration isolators are commonly known as flexible, or elastic,  shock mounts. An interesting feature common to most shock  mounts is that the rubber and metal parts are arranged so that,  under normal conditions, rubber alone supports the engine.  Of course, if the engine is subjected to abnormal shocks or  loads, the metal snubbers limit excessive movement of the  engine. Dynafocal engine mounts, or vibration isolators, are  units that give directional support to the engines. Dynafocal  engine mounts have the mounting pad angled to point to the  CG of the engines mass.  [Figure 8-16]  

# Mounts for Turbofan Engines  

The engine mounts on most turbofan engines perform the  same basic functions of supporting the engine and transmitting  the loads imposed by the engine to the aircraft structure. Most  turbine engine mounts are made of stainless steel and are  typically located as illustrated in  Figure 8-17.  Some engine mounting systems use two mounts to support the forward end  of the engine and a single mount at the rear end.  

# Turbine Vibration Isolation Engine Mounts  

The vibration isolator engine mounts support the power  plants and isolate the airplane structure from adverse  engine vibrations. Each power plant is generally supported  by forward vibration isolator mounts and an aft vibration  isolator mount.  

The forward vibration isolator engine mounts carry vertical,  side, and axial (thrust) loads and allow engine growth due  to thermal expansion. The aft mounts take only vertical and  side loads; however, they will also accommodate thermal  expansion of the engine without applying axial loads to the  engine flanges.  

![](images/75ee494cd30bcb934a1e92800a322051e7d0ab5c8a633474655864181bf06a2f.jpg)  
Figure 8-17.   Turbine engine front mount.  

The vibration isolators consist of a resilient material  permanently enclosed in a metal case. As an engine vibrates,  the resilient material deforms slightly, thereby dampening  the vibrations before they reach the airplane structure. If  complete failure or loss of the resilient material occurs, the  isolators will continue to support the engine.  

# Preservation & Storage of Engines  

An engine awaiting overhaul or return to service after  overhaul must be given careful attention. It does not receive  the daily care and attention necessary to detect and correct  early stages of corrosion. For this reason, some definite  action must be taken to prevent corrosion from affecting the  engine. Engines that are not flown regularly may not achieve  normal service life because of corrosion in and around the  cylinders. The normal combustion process creates moisture  and corrosive by-products that attack the unprotected surfaces  of the cylinder walls, valves, and any other exposed areas  that are unprotected. In engines that have accumulated 50  hours or more time in service in a short period, the cylinder  walls have acquired a varnish that tends to protect them  from corrosive action; engines under favorable atmospheric  conditions can remain inactive for several weeks without  evidence of damage by corrosion. This is the best-case  scenario, but aircraft that operate close to oceans, lakes,  rivers, and humid regions have a greater need for engine  preservation than engines operated in dry low humid areas.  

# Corrosion-Preventive Materials  

An engine in service is in a sense self-purging of moisture,  since the heat of combustion evaporates the moisture in and  around the engine, and the lubricating oil circulated through  the engine temporarily forms a protective coating on the  metal it contacts. If the operation of an engine in service  is limited or suspended for a period of time, the engine is  preserved to a varying extent, depending upon how long it  is to be inoperative. There are three types of engine storage:  active engine, temporary, and indefinite. An engine in active  storage is defined as having at least one continuous hour of  operation with an oil temperature of at least   $165\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to  $200\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$    and storage time not to exceed 30 days. Temporary storage  describes an aircraft and engine that is not flown for 30 to  90 days, and indefinite storage is for an aircraft not to be  flown for over 90 days or is removed from the aircraft for  extended time.  

# Corrosion-Preventive Compounds  

The preservation materials discussed are used for all types  of engine storage. Corrosion-preventive compounds are  petroleum-based products that form a wax-like film over the  metal to which they are applied. Several types of corrosion- preventive compounds are manufactured according to  different specifications to fit the various aviation needs. The  type mixed with engine oil to form a corrosion-preventive  mixture is a relatively light compound that readily blends  with engine oil when the mixture is heated to the proper  temperature.  

The light mixture is available in three forms: MIL-C-6529C  type I, type II, or type III. Type I is a concentrate and must be  blended with three parts of MIL-L-22851 or MIL-L-6082C  (SAE J1966) grade 1100 oil to one part of concentrate. Type  II is a ready-mixed material with MIL-L-22851 or grade 1100  oil and does not require dilution. Type III is a ready-mixed  material with grade 1010 oil for use in turbine engines only.  The light mixture is intended for use when a preserved engine  is to remain inactive for less than 30 days. It is also used to  spray cylinders and other designated areas.  

The desired proportions of lubricating oil, and either heavy or  light corrosion-preventive compound, must not be obtained  by adding the compound to the oil already in the engine. The  mixture must be prepared separately before applying to the  engine or placing in an oil tank.  

A heavy compound is used for the dip treating of metal  parts and surfaces. It must be heated to a high temperature  to be sufficiently liquid to effectively coat the objects to be  preserved. A commercial solvent, or kerosene spray, is used  to remove corrosion-preventive compounds from the engine  or parts when they are being prepared for return to service.  

Although corrosion-preventive compounds act as an insulator  from moisture, in the presence of excessive moisture, they  eventually break down and corrosion begins. Also, the  compounds eventually dry because their oil base gradually  evaporates. This allows moisture to contact the engine’s metal  and aids in corroding it. Therefore, when an engine is stored  in a shipping case or container, some dehydrating (moisture  removing) agent must be used to remove the moisture from  the air in and around the engine.  

# Dehydrating Agents  

There are a number of substances (referred to as desiccants)  that can absorb moisture from the atmosphere in sufficient  quantities to be useful as dehydrators. One of these is silica  gel. This gel is an ideal dehydrating agent since it does not  dissolve when saturated.  

As a corrosion preventive, bags of silica gel are placed around  and inside various accessible parts of a stored engine. It is  also used in clear plastic plugs, called dehydrator plugs,  that can be screwed into engine openings, such as the  spark plug holes. Cobalt chloride is added to the silica gel  used in dehydrator plugs. This additive makes it possible  

![](images/ec32b89fd34378e6c549b8b74dce425c323a6b588c27b8b4f1d2d42e6f0c383d.jpg)  
Figure 8-18.   Dehydrator plug “pink” showing high humidity  (Sacramento Sky Ranch).

Figure 8-19.   Dehydrator plug “blue” showing low humidity  (Sacramento Sky Ranch).  

for the plugs to indicate the moisture content, or relative  humidity, of the air surrounding the engine. The cobalt- chloride-treated silica gel remains a bright blue color with  low relative humidity; as the relative humidity increases, the  shade of the blue becomes progressively lighter, becoming  lavender at 30 percent relative humidity and fading through  the various shades of pink  [Figure 8-18],  until at 60 percent  relative humidity it is a natural or white color. Some types  of dehydrator plugs can be dried by removing the silica gel  and heating the gel to dry it out, returning it to its original  blue color.  [Figure 8-19]  When the relative humidity is less  than 30 percent, corrosion does not normally take place.  Therefore, if the dehydrator plugs are bright blue, the air in  the engine has so little moisture that internal corrosion is held  to a minimum. This same cobalt-chloride-treated silica gel is  used in humidity indicator envelopes. These envelopes can  be fastened to the stored engine so that they can be inspected  through a small window in the shipping case or metal engine  container. All desiccants are sealed in containers to prevent  their becoming saturated with moisture before they are used.  Care should be taken never to leave the container open or  improperly closed.  

# Engine Preservation & Return to Service  

Before an engine is placed in temporary or indefinite storage,  it should be operated and filled with a corrosion-preventive oil  mixture added in the oil system to retard corrosion by coating  the engine’s internal parts. Drain the normal lubricating oil  from the sump or system and replace with a preservative oil  mixture according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Operate  the engine until normal operating temperatures are obtained  for at least one hour.  

Always take the appropriate precautions when turning or  working around a propeller. After the flight, remove all the  spark plug leads and the top spark plugs.  

To prevent corrosion, spray each cylinder interior with  corrosion-preventive mixture to prevent moisture and oxygen  from contacting the deposits left by combustion. Spray the  cylinders by inserting the nozzle of the spray gun into each  spark plug hole and playing the gun to cover as much area  as possible. Before spraying, each cylinder to be treated  should be at the bottom center position and the oil at room  temperature. This allows the entire inside of the cylinder  to become coated with corrosion-preventive mixture. After  spraying each engine cylinder at bottom center, respray each  cylinder while the crankshaft is stationary with none of the  cylinder’s pistons at top dead center.  

The crankshaft must not be moved after this final spraying,  or the seal of corrosion-preventive mixture between the  pistons and cylinder walls are broken. Air can then enter past  the pistons into the engine. Also, the coating of corrosion- preventive mixture on the cylinder walls is scraped away,  exposing the bare metal to possible corrosion. The engine  should have a sign attached similar to the following: “DO  NOT TURN CRANKSHAFT—ENGINE PRESERVED  PRESERVATION DATE ____________.”  

When preparing the engine for storage, dehydrator plugs are  

![](images/f83d42236fc07c429841a4598532d506bbb8cd61f02876c82168c215184cb874.jpg)  
Figure 8-20.   Ignition harness lead support installation.  

screwed into the spark plug opening of each cylinder. If the  engine is to be stored in a wooden shipping case, the ignition  harness leads are attached to the dehydrator plugs with lead  supports.  [Figure 8-20]  Special ventilatory plugs are installed  in the spark plug holes of an engine stored horizontally in a  storage container. Any engine being prepared for storage must  receive thorough treatment around the exhaust ports. Because  the residue of exhaust gases is potentially very corrosive,  a corrosion-preventive mixture must be sprayed into each  exhaust port, including the exhaust valve. After the exhaust  ports have been thoroughly coated, a moisture-proof and  oil-proof gasket backed by a metal or wooden plate should  be secured over the exhaust ports using the exhaust stack  mounting studs and nuts. These covers form a seal to prevent  moisture from entering the interior of the engine through the  exhaust ports. Engines stored in metal containers usually  have special ventilatory covers. Another point at which the  engine must be sealed is the intake manifold. If the carburetor  is to remain on the engine during storage, the throttle valve  should be wired open and a seal installed over the air inlet.  But, if the carburetor is removed and stored separately, the  seal is made at the carburetor mounting pad. The seal used in  either instance can be an oil-proof and moisture-proof gasket,  backed by a wooden or metal plate securely bolted into place.  Silica gel should be placed in the intake manifold to absorb  moisture. The silica gel bags are usually suspended from  the cover plate. This eliminates the possibility of forgetting  to remove the silica gel bags when the engine is eventually  removed from storage. A ventilatory cover, without silica  gel bags attached, can be used when the engine is stored in  a metal container.  

After the following details have been taken care of, the  engine is ready to be packed into its container. If the engine  has not been spray coated with corrosion-preventive mixture,  the propeller shaft and propeller shaft thrust bearing must  be coated with the compound. Then, a plastic sleeve, or  moisture-proof paper, is secured around the shaft, and a  threaded protector cap is screwed onto the propeller retaining  nut threads.  

All engine openings into which dehydrator plugs (or  ventilatory plugs if the engine is stored in a metal container)  have not been fitted must be sealed. At points where  corrosion-preventive mixture can seep from the interior of  the engine, such as the oil inlet and outlet, oil-proof and  moisture-proof gasket material backed by a metal or wooden  plate should be used. At other points moisture-proof tape can  be used if it is carefully installed.  

Before its installation in a shipping container, the engine  should be carefully inspected to determine if the following  accessories, which are not a part of the basic engine, have  been removed: spark plugs and spark plug thermocouples,  remote fuel pump adapters (if applicable), propeller hub  attaching bolts (if applicable), starters, generators, vacuum  pumps, hydraulic pumps, propeller governors, and engine- driven fuel pumps.  

1. 	 Remove seals and all desiccant bags. 2. 	 Remove cylinder dehydrators and plugs or spark plugs  from upper and lower spark plug holes. 3. 	 Remove oil sump drain plug and drain the corrosion  preventive mixture. Replace drain plug, torque and  safety. Remove oil filter. Install new oil filter, torque  and safety. Service the engine with oil in accordance  with the manufacturer’s instructions. 	 Warning:  To prevent serious bodily injury or death,  accomplish the following before moving the propeller: a. 	 Disconnect all spark plug leads. b. 	 Verify that magneto switches are connected to  magnetos and that they are in the off position and  P-leads are grounded. c. 	 Throttle position CLOSED. d. 	 Mixture control IDLE-CUT-OFF. e. 	 Set brakes and block aircraft wheels. Ensure that  aircraft tiedowns are installed and verify that the  cabin door latch is open. f. 	 Do not stand within the arc of the propeller blades  while turning the propeller. 4. 	 Rotate propeller by hand several revolutions to remove  preservative oil. 5. 	 Service and install spark plugs and ignition leads in  accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 6. 	 Service engine and aircraft in accordance with the  manufacturer’s instruction.  

7. 	 Thoroughly clean the aircraft and engine. Perform  visual inspection. 8. 	 Correct any discrepancies. 9. 	 Conduct a normal engine start. 10. 	Perform operational test in accordance with operational  inspection of the applicable Maintenance Manual. 11. 	Correct any discrepancies. 12 	 Perform a test flight in accordance with airframe  manufacturer’s instructions. 13. 	Correct any discrepancies prior to returning aircraft  to service. 14. 	Change oil and filter after 25 hours of operation.  

# Engine Shipping Containers  

For protection, engines are sealed in plastic or foil envelopes  and can be packed in a wooden shipping case or in pressurized  metal containers.  

The engine is lowered into the shipping container so that the  mounting plate can be bolted into position. The protective  envelope is attached directly to the base of the shipping  case. Then, the engine is lowered vertically onto the base  and bolted directly to it. A carburetor not mounted on its  reciprocating engine (or no provision is made to seal it in a  small container to be placed inside the shipping case) can, in  some cases, be fastened to a specially constructed platform  bolted to the engine.  

Before the protective envelope is sealed, silica gel should be  placed around the engine to dehydrate the air sealed into the  envelope. The amount of silica gel used is determined by the  size of the engine. The protective envelope is then carefully  gathered around the engine and partially sealed, leaving an  opening at one end from which as much air as possible is  exhausted. A vacuum applied to the container is very useful  for this purpose and is also an aid in detecting any leaks in  the envelope. The envelope is then completely sealed, usually  by pressing the edges together and fusing them with heat.  

Before lowering the shipping case cover over the engine,  a quick inventory should be made. Be sure the humidity  indicator card is placed so that it can be seen through the  

![](images/6777a25dc33be32424d2dbf55bc79341b48386c672574b4505fb751ca7850fcd.jpg)  
Figure 8-21.   Turbine engine shipping container.  

inspection window and that everything required is enclosed  in the container. While lowering the wooden shipping case  cover into position, be careful that it does not twist and tear  the protective envelope. Secure the cover and stencil or mark  the date of preservation on the case. Also, indicate whether  the engine is repairable or serviceable.  

There are several types of shipping containers in use.  [Figure 8-21]  Another type allows horizontal installation  of an engine, thus eliminating the need for an extra hoist.  The engine is simply lowered onto the base portion of the  container and secured. Then, silica gel bags are packed into  the container, usually in a special section. The amount of  silica gel required in a metal container is generally greater  than that needed in a wooden shipping case, since the volume  of air in the metal container is much greater than that in the  protective envelope installed around an engine in a wooden  shipping case. Also, in the metal container the silica gel bags  must dehydrate the interior of the engine, since ventilatory  plugs are normally installed in the engine openings in place  of dehydrator plugs. All records of the engine should be  enclosed inside the shipping container or on the outside for  accessibility. A humidity indicator should be fastened inside  the containers with an inspection window provided. Then,  the rubber seal between the base and the top of the container  must be carefully inspected. This seal is usually suitable for  re-use several times. After the top of the container has been  lowered into position and fastened to the base of the container,  dehydrated air at approximately 5 pounds per square inch  (psi) pressure is forced into the container. The container  should be checked for leaks by occasional rechecks of the  air pressure, since radical changes in temperature affect the  air pressure in the container.  

# Inspection of Stored Engines  

Most maintenance shops provide a scheduled inspection  system for engines in storage. Normally, the humidity  indicators on engines stored in shipping cases are inspected  every 30 days. When the protective envelope must be opened  to inspect the humidity indicator, the inspection period may  be extended to once every 90 days, if local conditions permit.  The humidity indicator of a metal container is inspected every  180 days under normal conditions.  

If the humidity indicator in a wooden shipping case shows  by its color that more than 30 percent relative humidity is  present in the air around the engine, all desiccants should  be replaced. If more than half the dehydrator plugs installed  in the spark plug holes indicate the presence of excessive  moisture, the interior of the cylinders should be resprayed.  If the humidity indicator in a metal container gives a safe  blue indication, but air pressure has dropped below 1 psi, the  container needs only to be brought to the proper pressure with  dehydrated air. However, if the humidity indicator shows an  unsafe (pink) condition, the engine should be represerved.  

# Preservation & Depreservation of Gas  Turbine Engines  

The procedures for preserving and depreserving gas turbine  engines vary depending upon the length of inactivity, the  type of preservative used, and whether or not the engine  may be rotated during the inactive period. Much of the basic  information on corrosion control presented in the section on  reciprocating engines is applicable to gas turbine engines.  However, the requirements for the types of preservatives and  their use are normally different.  

The lubrication system is usually drained and may or may  not be flushed with preservative oil. The engine fuel system  is generally filled with preservative oil, including the fuel  control. Before the engine can be returned to service,  the preservative oil must be completely flushed from the  fuel system by motoring the engine and bleeding the fuel  system. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions  when performing any preservation or depreservation of gas  turbine engines.  

# Chapter 9 Engine Fire Protection Systems  

# Introduction  

Because fire is one of the most dangerous threats to an  aircraft, the potential fire zones of all multiengine aircraft  currently produced are protected by a fixed fire protection  system. A “fire zone” is an area or region of an aircraft  designated by the manufacturer to require fire detection  and/or fire extinguishing equipment and a high degree  of inherent fire resistance. The term “fixed” describes a  permanently installed system in contrast to any type of  portable fire extinguishing equipment, such as a hand-held  fire extinguisher.  

In accordance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) parts 23 and 25, engine fire protection  systems are mandatory on: multiengine turbine-powered  aircraft, multiengine reciprocating engine-powered aircraft  incorporating turbochargers, aircraft with engine(s) located  where they are not readily visible from the flight deck, all  commuter and transport category aircraft, and the auxiliary  power unit (APU) compartment of any aircraft incorporating  an APU. Fire protection systems are not mandatory for many  single and twin reciprocating engine general aviation (GA)  aircraft.  

Several general failures or hazards can result in overheat  conditions or fires peculiar to turbine engine aircraft because  of their operating characteristics. The two major types of  turbine failure can be classified as 1) thermodynamic and  2) mechanical.  

Thermodynamic causes upset the proportion of air used to  cool combustion temperatures to the levels that the turbine  materials can tolerate. When the cooling cycle is upset,  turbine blades can melt, causing a sudden loss of thrust. The  rapid buildup of ice on inlet screens or inlet guide vanes can  result in severe overheating, causing the turbine blades to  melt or to be severed and thrown outward. Such failure can  result in a severed tail cone and possible penetration of the  aircraft structure, tanks, or equipment near the turbine wheel.  In general, most thermodynamic failures are caused by ice,  excess air bleed or leakage, or faulty controls that permit  compressor stall or excess fuel.  

Mechanical failures, such as fractured or thrown blades,  can also lead to overheat conditions or fires. Thrown blades  can puncture the tail cone, creating an overheat condition.  Failure of forward stages of multi-stage turbines is usually  much more severe. Penetration of the turbine case by failed  blades is a possible fire hazard, as is the penetration of lines  and components containing flammable fluids.  

A high flow of fuel through an improperly adjusted fuel  nozzle can cause burn-through of the tail cone in some  engines. Engine fires can be caused by burning fluid that  occasionally runs out through the exhaust pipe.  

# Components  

A complete fire protection system includes both a fire  detection and a fire extinguishing system. To detect fires  or overheat conditions, detectors are placed in the various  zones to be monitored. Fires are detected in aircraft by using  one or more of the following: overheat detectors, rate-of- temperature-rise detectors, and flame detectors. In addition  to these methods, other types of detectors are used in aircraft  fire protection systems but are not used to detect engine fires.  For example, smoke detectors are better suited to monitor  areas such as baggage compartments or lavatories, where  materials burn slowly or smolder. Other types of detectors  in this category include carbon monoxide detectors.  

Fire protection systems on current-production aircraft do not  rely on observation by crewmembers as a primary method  of fire detection. An ideal fire detector system includes as  many of the following features as possible:  

1.	 A system that does not cause false warnings under any  flight or ground condition. 2.	 Rapid indication of a fire and accurate location of the  fire. 3.	 Accurate indication that a fire is out. 4.	 Indication that a fire has reignited. 5.	 Continuous indication for duration of a fire. 6.	 Means for electrically testing the detector system from  the aircraft flight deck. 7.	 Detectors that resist damage from exposure to oil,  water, vibration, extreme temperatures, or handling. 8.	 Detectors that are light in weight and easily adaptable  to any mounting position. 9.	 Detector circuitry that operates directly from the  aircraft power system without inverters. 10.	 Minimum electrical current requirements when not  indicating a fire.  

11.	 Each detector system should turn on a flight deck light,  indicating the location of the fire, and have an audible  alarm system.  

12.	 A separate detector system for each engine.  

# Engine Fire Detection Systems  

Several different types of fire detection systems are installed  in aircraft to detect engine fires. Two common types used are  spot detectors and continuously loop systems. Spot detector  systems use individual sensors to monitor a fire zone.  Examples of spot detector systems are the thermal switch  system, the thermocouple system, the optical fire detection  system, and the pneumatic-based thermal fire detection  system. Continuous loop systems are typically installed  on transport type aircraft and provide more complete fire  detection coverage by using several loop-type sensors.  

# Thermal Switch System  

A number of detectors or sensing devices are available.  Many older model aircraft still operating have some type of  thermal switch system or thermocouple system. A thermal  switch system has one or more lights energized by the aircraft  power system and thermal switches that control operation of  the light(s). These thermal switches are heat-sensitive units  that complete electrical circuits at a certain temperature.  They are connected in parallel with each other, but in series  with the indicator lights  [Figure 9-1] . If the temperature rises  above a set value in any one section of the circuit, the thermal  switch closes, completing the light circuit to indicate a fire  or overheat condition.  

No set number of thermal switches is required; the exact  number usually is determined by the aircraft manufacturer.  On some installations, all the thermal detectors are connected  to one light; others may have a separate thermal switch for  each indicator light.  

![](images/c091a048c316d855acc9f06c222fb6fea965dfb7a3d36d6984e87575f3d1e08f.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.   Thermal switch fire circuit.  

Some warning lights are push-to-test lights. The bulb is tested  by pushing it in to check an auxiliary test circuit. The circuit  shown in  Figure 9-1  includes a test relay. With the relay  contact in the position shown, there are two possible paths  for current flow from the switches to the light. This is an  additional safety feature. Energizing the test relay completes  a series circuit and checks all the wiring and the light bulb.  

Also included in the circuit shown in  Figure 9-1  is a dimming  relay. By energizing the dimming relay, the circuit is altered to  include a resistor in series with the light. In some installations,  several circuits are wired through the dimming relay, and all  the warning lights may be dimmed at the same time.  

# Thermocouple Systems  

The thermocouple fire warning system operates on an  entirely different principle than the thermal switch system.  A thermocouple depends on the rate of temperature rise and  does not give a warning when an engine slowly overheats  or a short circuit develops. The system consists of a relay  box, warning lights, and thermocouples. The wiring system  of these units may be divided into the following circuits:  (1) the detector circuit, (2) the alarm circuit, and (3) the test  circuit. These circuits are shown in  Figure 9-2 .  

The relay box contains two relays, the sensitive relay and the  slave relay, and the thermal test unit. Such a box may contain  from one to eight identical circuits, depending on the number  of potential fire zones. The relays control the warning lights.  In turn, the thermocouples control the operation of the relays.  The circuit consists of several thermocouples in series with  each other and with the sensitive relay.  

Thermocouple leads are made from a variety of metals,  depending on the maximum temperature to which they are  exposed. Iron and constantan, or copper and constantan,  are common for CHT measurement. Chromel and alumel  are used for turbine EGT thermocouples. The point where  these metals are joined and exposed to the heat of a fire  is called a hot junction. There is also a reference junction  enclosed in a dead air space between two insulation blocks.  

![](images/4fabf78b0834f825da3f101ef37f07d50264a0d0b31b0316ba5ea483888cea35.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.   Thermocouple fire warning circuit.  

A metal cage surrounds the thermocouple to give mechanical  protection without hindering the free movement of air to the  hot junction. Thermocouple leads are designed for a specific  installation and may not be altered, if they are altered they  will no longer be calibrated specific probe and instrument  combination.  

If the temperature rises rapidly, the thermocouple produces  a voltage because of the temperature difference between the  reference junction and the hot junction. If both junctions  are heated at the same rate, no voltage results. In the engine  compartment, there is a normal, gradual rise in temperature  from engine operation; because it is gradual, both junctions  heat at the same rate and no warning signal is given.  

If there is a fire, however, the hot junction heats more rapidly  than the reference junction. The reference junction is also  commonly referred to as the cold junction. The ensuing  voltage causes a current to flow within the detector circuit.  Any time the current is greater than 4 milliamperes (0.004  ampere), the sensitive relay closes. This completes a circuit  from the aircraft power system to the coil of the slave relay.  The slave relay then closes and completes the circuit to the  warning light to give a visual fire warning.  

The total number of thermocouples used in individual  detector circuits depends on the size of the fire zones and the  total circuit resistance, which usually does not exceed 5 ohms.  As shown in  Figure 9-2 , the circuit has two resistors. The  resistor connected across the slave relay terminals absorbs  the coil’s self-induced voltage to prevent arcing across the  points of the sensitive relay. The contacts of the sensitive relay  are so fragile that they burn or weld if arcing is permitted.  

When the sensitive relay opens, the circuit to the slave  relay is interrupted and the magnetic field around its coil  collapses. When this happens, the coil gets a voltage through  self-induction, but with the resistor across the coil terminals,  there is a path for any current flow as a result of this voltage.  Thus, arcing at the sensitive relay contacts is eliminated.  

# Optical Fire Detection Systems  

Optical sensors, often referred to as “flame detectors,”  are designed to alarm when they detect the presence of  prominent, specific radiation emissions from hydrocarbon  flames. The two types of optical sensors available are infrared  (IR) and ultraviolet, based on the specific emission wave  lengths they are designed to detect.  

# Infrared Optical Fire Protection  

IR-based optical flame detectors are used primarily on light  turboprop aircraft and helicopter engines. These sensors have proven to be very dependable and economical for the  relatively benign environments of these applications.  

# Principle of Operation  

Radiation emitted by the fire crosses the airspace between  the fire and the detector and impinges on the detector front  face and window. The window allows a broad spectrum  of radiation to pass into the detector where it impinges  on the face of the sensing device filter. The filter allows  only radiation in a tight waveband centered around 4.3  micrometers in the IR to pass on to the radiation-sensitive  surface of the sensing device. The radiation striking the  sensing device minutely raises its temperature causing small  thermoelectric voltages to be generated. These voltages are  fed to an amplifier whose output is connected to various  analytical electronic processing circuits. The processing  electronics is tailored exactly to the time signature of all  known hydrocarbon flame sources and ignores false alarm  sources, such as incandescent lights and sunlight. Alarm  sensitivity level is accurately controlled by a digital circuit.  A typical warning system is illustrated in  Figure 9-3.  

# Pneumatic Thermal Fire Detection  

Pneumatic detectors are based on the principles of gas laws.  The sensing element consists of a closed helium-filled tube  connected at one end to a responder assembly. As the element  is heated, the gas pressure inside the tube increases until the  alarm threshold is reached. At this point, an internal switch  closes and reports an alarm to the flight deck. The pneumatic  detector integrity pressure switch opens and triggers the  fault alarm if the pneumatic detector losses pressure, as in  the case of a leak.  

# Continuous-Loop Detector Systems  

Large commercial aircraft almost exclusively use continuous  thermal sensing elements for powerplant protection, since  these systems offer superior detection performance and  coverage, and they have the proven ruggedness to survive in  the harsh environment of modern turbofan engines.  

A continuous-loop detector, or sensing system, permits  more complete coverage of a fire hazard area than any  of the spot-type temperature detectors. Continuous-loop  systems are versions of the thermal switch system. They are  overheat systems, heat-sensitive units that complete electrical  circuits at a certain temperature. There is no rate-of-heat- rise sensitivity in a continuous-loop system. Two widely  used types of continuous-loop systems are the Kidde and  the Fenwal systems. This text briefly discusses the Fenwal  system, while the Kidde system is discussed more in-depth.  

# Fenwal Continuous-Loop System  

The Fenwal system uses a slender inconel tube packed with  thermally sensitive eutectic salt and a nickel wire center  

![](images/5070135bd91a29dfa9447490537361359fca837e8e5cbf486c800989c050a69a.jpg)  
Figure 9-3.   Optical fire detection system circuit.  

conductor.  [Figure 9-4]  Lengths of these sensing elements  are connected in series to a control unit. The elements may  be of equal or varying length and of the same or different  temperature settings. The control unit, operating directly from  the power source, impresses a small voltage on the sensing  elements. When an overheat condition occurs at any point  along the element length, the resistance of the eutectic salt  within the sensing element drops sharply, causing current to  flow between the outer sheath and the center conductor. This  

![](images/b847c0ee6485ca3866c6432f924d069c711e9a51c73018e17ae7d468c25ed098.jpg)  
Figure 9-4.   Fenwal sensing element.  

current flow is sensed by the control unit, which produces a  signal to actuate the output relay.  

When the fire has been extinguished or the critical temperature  lowered, the Fenwal system automatically returns to standby  alert, ready to detect any subsequent fire or overheat  condition. The Fenwal system may be wired to employ a  “loop” circuit. In this case, should an open circuit occur, the  system still signals fire or overheat. If multiple open circuits  occur, only that section between breaks becomes inoperative.  

# Kidde Continuous-Loop System  

In the Kidde continuous-loop system, two wires are imbedded  in an inconel tube filled with a thermistor core material.  [Figure 9-5]  Two electrical conductors go through the length  of the core. One conductor has a ground connection to the  tube and the other conductor connects to the fire detection  control unit.  

As the temperature of the core increases, electrical resistance  to ground decreases. The fire detection control unit monitors  this resistance. If the resistance decreases to the overheat  set point, an overheat indication occurs in the flight deck.  Typically, a 10-second time delay is incorporated for the  

![](images/98d81d33d63ef33d1343ecc6332f8134bf9eec464db7ea9a5e7095171edd7746.jpg)  
Figure 9-5.   Kidde continuous-loop system.  

overheat indication. If the resistance decreases more to the  fire set point, a fire warning occurs. When the fire or overheat  condition is gone, the resistance of the core material increases  to the reset point and the flight deck indications go away.  

The rate of change of resistance identifies an electrical short  or a fire. The resistance decreases more quickly with an  electrical short than with a fire. In addition to fire and overheat  detection, the Kidde continuous-loop system can supply  nacelle temperature data to the aircraft condition monitoring  function of the Aircraft In-Flight Monitoring System (AIMS).  

# Sensing Element  

The sensing element consists, essentially, of an infinite  number of unit thermistors electrically in parallel along its  length. The resistance of the sensing element is a function of  the length heated, as well as the temperature-heating of less  than the full length of element, which requires that portion to  be heated to a higher temperature to achieve the same total  resistance change. As a result, the system responds not to a  fixed alarm temperature but to the sum of the resistances (in  parallel) that reflects a nonarithmetic “average.” The sensing  element may be routed close to nonhazardous hot spots that  may have a normal temperature well above the overall alarm temperature, without danger of causing a false alarm. This  feature permits the alarm point to be set close to the maximum  general ambient temperature, giving greater sensitivity to a  general overheat or fire without being subject to false alarms  from localized nonhazardous hot spots.  

Combination Fire & Overheat Warning  

The analog signal from the thermistor sensing element permits  the control circuits to be arranged to give a two-level response  from the same sensing element loop. The first is an overheat  warning at a temperature level below the fire warning,  indicating a general engine compartment temperature  rise, which could be caused by leakage of hot bleed air or  combustion gas into the engine compartment. It could be an  early warning of fire and would alert the crew to appropriate  action to reduce the engine compartment temperature. The  second-level response would be at a level above that attainable  by the leaking hot gas and would be the fire warning.  

# Temperature Trend Indication  

The analog signal produced by the sensing element loop as  its temperature changes can readily be converted to signals  suitable for meter or cathode ray tube (CRT) display to  indicate engine bay temperature increases from normal.  A comparison of the readings from each loop system also  provides a check on the condition of the fire detection system,  because the two loops should normally read alike.  

# System Test  

The integrity of the continuous-loop fire detection system  may be tested by actuating a test switch in the flight deck,  which switches one end of the sensing element loop from  its control circuit to a test circuit, built into the control unit,  that simulates the sensing element resistance change due to  fire.  [Figure 9-6]  If the sensing element loop is unbroken,  the resistance detected “seen” by the control circuit is now  

![](images/820fb3e56170669c586e2474b9db6b439bcf7fadff6ff9de71d60a2693595c20.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.   Continuous-loop fire detection system test circuit.  

that of the simulated fire and so the alarm is signaled. This  demonstrates, in addition to the continuity of the sensing  element loop, the integrity of the alarm indicator circuit and  the proper functioning of the control circuits. The thermistor  properties of the sensing element remain unchanged for the  life of the element (no chemical or physical changes take  place on heating), so that it functions properly as long as it  is electrically connected to the control unit.  

# Fault Indication  

Provision can be made in the control unit to send a fault signal  to activate a fault indicator whenever the short discriminator  circuit detects a short in the sensing element loop. While this  is a requirement in 14 CFR for transport category aircraft  because such a short disables the fire detection system, it is  offered as an option for other aircraft types in which it may  not be a requirement.  

# Dual-Loop Systems  

Dual-loop systems are, in essence, two complete basic fire  detection systems with their output signals connected so that  both must signal to result in a fire warning. This arrangement,  called “AND” logic, results in greatly increased reliability  against false fire warnings from any cause. Should one of  the two loops be found inoperative at the preflight integrity  test, a flight deck selector switch disconnects that loop and  allows the signal from the other loop alone to activate the  fire warning. Since the single operative loop meets all fire  detector requirements, the aircraft can be safely dispatched,  and maintenance deferred to a more convenient time.  However, should one of the two loops become inoperative  in flight and a fire subsequently occur, the fire signaling  loop activates a flight deck fault signal that alerts the flight  crew to select single-loop operation to confirm the possible  occurrence of fire.  

Automatic Self-Interrogation  

Dual-loop systems automatically perform the loop switching  and decision-making function required of the flight crew  upon appearance of the fault indication in the flight deck.  Automatic self-interrogation eliminates the fault indication  and assures the immediate appearance of the fire indication  should fire occur while at least one loop of the dual-loop  system is operative. Should the control circuit from a single  loop signal “fire,” the self-interrogation circuit automatically  tests the functioning of the other loop. If it tests operative,  the circuit suppresses the fire signal (because the operative  loop would have signaled if a fire existed). If, however, the  other loop tests inoperative, the circuit outputs a fire signal.  The interrogation and decision takes place in milliseconds,  so that no delay occurs if a fire actually exists.  

# Support Tube-Mounted Sensing Elements  

When you want to mount the sensing elements on the engine,  and in some cases, on the aircraft structure, the support tube- mounted element solves the problem of providing sufficient  element support points, and greatly facilitates the removal and  reinstallation of the sensing elements for engine or system  maintenance.  

Most modern installations use the support tube concept of  mounting sensing elements for better maintainability as well  as increased reliability. The sensing element is attached to  a prebent stainless steel tube by closely spaced clamps and  bushings, where it is supported from vibration damage and  protected from pinching and excessive bending. The support  tube-mounted elements can be furnished with either single- or  dual-sensing elements.  

Being prebent to the designed configuration assures its  installation in the aircraft precisely in its designed location,  where it has the necessary clearance to be free from the  possibility of the elements chafing against engine or aircraft  structure. The assembly requires only a few attachment  points, and removal for engine maintenance is quick and  easy. Should the assembly require repair or maintenance, it  is easily replaced with another assembly, leaving the repair  for the shop. A damaged sensing element is easily replaced  in the assembly. The assembly is  rugged, easy to handle, and  unlikely to suffer damage during handling for installation  or removal.  

# Fire Detection Control Unit (Fire Detection Card)  

The control unit for the simplest type of system typically  contains the necessary electronic resistance monitoring  and alarm output circuits, housed in a hermetically sealed  aluminum case and filled with a mounting bracket and  circular electrical connector. For more sophisticated systems,  control modules may be employed that contain removable  control cards having circuitry for individual hazard areas, and/ or unique functions. In the most advanced applications, the  detection system circuitry controls all aircraft fire protection  functions, including fire detection and extinguishing for  engines, APUs, cargo bays, and bleed air systems.  

# Fire Zones  

The powerplant installation has several designated fire  zones: (1) the engine power section; (2) the engine accessory  section; (3) except for reciprocating engines, any complete  powerplant compartment in which no isolation is provided  between the engine power section and the engine accessory  section; (4) any APU compartment; (5) any fuel-burning  heater and other combustion equipment installation; (6)  the compressor and accessory sections of turbine engines;  and (7) combustor, turbine, and tailpipe sections of turbine  engine installations that contain lines or components carrying  flammable fluids or gases.  Figure 9-7  shows fire protection  for a large turbo fan engine.  

In addition to the engine and nacelle area zones, other areas  on multiengine aircraft are provided with fire detection  and protection systems. These areas include baggage  compartments, lavatories, APU, combustion heater  installations, and other hazardous areas. Discussion of fire  protection for these areas is not included in this section, which  is limited to engine fire protection.  

# Engine Fire Extinguishing System  

Commuter aircraft certificated under 14 CFR part 23 are  required to have, at a minimum, a one-shot fire extinguishing  system. All transport category aircraft certificated under 14  CFR part 25 are required to have two discharges, each of  which produces adequate agent concentration. An individual  one-shot system may be used for APUs, fuel burning heaters,  and other combustion equipment. For each “other” designated  fire zone, two discharges (two-shot system) must be provided,  each of which produces adequate agent concentration.  [Figure 9-8]  

# Fire Extinguishing Agents  

The fixed fire extinguisher systems used in most engine fire  protection systems are designed to dilute the atmosphere with  an inert agent that does not support combustion. Many systems  use perforated tubing or discharge nozzles to distribute the  extinguishing agent. High rate of discharge (HRD) systems  use open-end tubes to deliver a quantity of extinguishing  agent in 1 to 2 seconds. The most common extinguishing  agent still used today is Halon 1301 because of its effective  firefighting capability and relatively low toxicity (U.L.  classification Group 61). Noncorrosive, Halon 1301 does not  affect the material it contacts and requires no clean-up when  discharged. Halon 1301 is the current extinguishing agent for  commercial aircraft, but a replacement is under development.  Because Halon 1301 depletes the ozone layer only recycled  Halon 1301 is currently available. Halon 1301 is used until  a suitable replacement is developed. Some military aircraft  use HCL-125, which the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) is testing for use in commercial aircraft.  

Carbon dioxide   $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$   is an effective extinguishing agent. It  is most often used in fire extinguishers that are available on  the ramp to fight fires on the exterior of the aircraft, such as  engine or APU fires.   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   has been used for many years to  extinguish flammable fluid fires and fires involving electrical  equipment. It is noncombustible and does not react with most  substances. It provides its own pressure for discharge from  the storage vessel, except in extremely cold climates where  a booster charge of nitrogen may be added to winterize the  system. Normally,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   is a gas, but it is easily liquefied by  compression and cooling. After liquefaction,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   remains in  a closed container as both liquid and gas. When  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   is then  discharged to the atmosphere, most of the liquid expands to  gas. Heat absorbed by the gas during vaporization cools the  remaining liquid to  $-110\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$  , and it becomes a finely divided  white solid, dry ice snow.

# Turbine Engine Ground Fire Protection  

On many aircraft, means are usually provided for rapid access  to the compressor, tailpipe, or burner compartments. Many  aircraft systems are equipped with spring-loaded or pop-out  access doors in the skin of the various compartments. Internal  engine tailpipe fires that take place during engine shutdown  or false starts can be blown out by motoring the engine with  the starter. A running engine can be accelerated to rated  speed to achieve the same result. If such a fire persists, a fire  extinguishing agent can be directed into the tailpipe. It should  be remembered that excessive use of   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  , or other agents  that have a cooling effect, can shrink the turbine housing on  the turbine and cause the engine to disintegrate.  

# Containers  

Fire extinguisher containers (HRD bottles) store a liquid  halogenated extinguishing agent and pressurized gas  (typically nitrogen) normally manufactured from stainless  steel. Depending upon design considerations, alternate  materials are available including titanium. Containers are  also available in a wide range of capacities and are produced  under Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications or  exemptions. Most aircraft containers are spherical in design,  which provides the lightest weight possible. However,  cylindrical shapes are available where space limitations are  a factor. Each container incorporates a temperature/pressure  sensitive safety relief diaphragm that prevents container  pressure from exceeding container test pressure in the event  of exposure to excessive temperatures.  [Figure 9-9]  

# Discharge Valves  

Discharge valves are installed on the containers. A cartridge  (squib) and frangible disc type valve are installed in the  outlet of the discharge valve assembly. Special assemblies  having solenoid-operated or manually-operated seat type  valves are also available. Two types of cartridge disc-release  techniques are used. Standard release type uses a slug driven  by explosive energy to rupture a segmented closure disc.  For high temperature or hermetically sealed units, a direct  explosive impact type cartridge is used, which applies  fragmentation impact to rupture a prestressed corrosion- resistant steel diaphragm. Most containers use conventional  metallic gasket seals that facilitate refurbishment following  discharge.  [Figure 9-10]  

# Pressure Indication  

A wide range of diagnostics are utilized to verify the fire  extinguisher agent charge status. A simple visually indicated  gauge is available, typically a vibration-resistant helical  bourdon-type indicator.  [ see  Figure 9-9]  

A combination gauge switch visually indicates actual  container pressure and also provides an electrical signal if  container pressure is lost, precluding the need for discharge  indicators. A ground checkable diaphragm-type low-pressure  switch is commonly used on hermetically sealed containers.  The Kidde system also has a temperature compensated  pressure switch that tracks the container pressure variations  with temperatures by using a hermetically sealed reference  chamber.

Figure 9-10.   Discharge valve (left) and cartridge (squib) (right).  

# Two-Way Check Valve  

A complete line of two-way check valves is available,  manufactured from either lightweight aluminum or steel.  These valves are required in a two-shot system to prevent  the agent in a reserve container from backing up into the  previous emptied main container. Valves are supplied with  either MS-33514 or MS-33656 fitting configurations.  

# Discharge Indicators  

Discharge indicators provide immediate visual evidence  of container discharge on fire extinguishing systems. Two  kinds of indicators can be furnished: thermal and discharge.  Both types are designed for aircraft and skin mounting.  [Figure 9-11]  

# Thermal Discharge Indicator (Red Disc)  

The thermal discharge indicator is connected to the fire  container relief fitting and ejects a red disc to show when  container contents have dumped overboard due to excessive  heat. The agent discharges through the opening created when  the disc blows out. This gives the flight and maintenance  crews an indication that the fire extinguisher container needs  to be replaced before the next flight.  

# Yellow Disc Discharge Indicator  

If the flight crew activates the fire extinguisher system, a  yellow disc is ejected from the skin of the aircraft fuselage.  This is an indication for the maintenance crew that the fire  extinguishing system was activated by the flight crew, and  that the fire extinguishing container needs to be replaced  before the next flight.  

# Fire Switch  

Fire switches are typically installed on the center overhead  panel or center console in the flight deck.  [Figure 9-12] When the fire switch is activated, the following happens: the  engine stops because the fuel control shuts off, the engine is  isolated from the aircraft systems, and the fire extinguishing  system is activated. Some aircraft use fire switches that need  to be pulled and turned to activate the system, while others  use a push-type switch with a guard. To prevent accidental  activation of the fire switch, a lock is installed that releases the  fire switch only when a fire has been detected. This lock can be manually released by the flight crew if the fire detection

system malfunctions.  [Figure 9-13]  

# Warning Systems  

Visible and audible warning systems are installed in the  flight deck to alert the flight crew. A horn sounds and one  or several warning lights illuminate to alert the flight crew  that an engine fire has been detected. These indications stop  when the fire is extinguished.  

# Fire Detection System Maintenance  

Fire detector sensing elements are located in many high- activity areas around aircraft engines. Their location, together  with their small size, increases the chance of damage to  the sensing elements during maintenance. An inspection  and maintenance program for all types of continuous-loop  systems should include the following visual checks. These  procedures are examples and should not be used to replace  the applicable manufacturer’s instructions.  

Sensing elements of a continuous-loop system should be  inspected for the following:  

1.	 Cracked or broken sections caused by crushing or  squeezing between inspection plates, cowl panels, or  engine components. 2.	 Abrasion caused by rubbing of the element on cowling,  accessories, or structural members. 3.	 Pieces of safety wire or other metal particles that may  short the spot-detector terminals. 4.	 Condition of rubber grommets in mounting clamps,  which may be softened from exposure to oils or  hardened from excessive heat. 5.	 Dents and kinks in sensing element sections. Limits on  the element diameter, acceptable dents and kinks, and  degree of smoothness of tubing contour are specified  by the manufacturer. No attempt should be made to  straighten any acceptable dent or kink, since stresses  may be set up that could cause tubing failure. (See  illustration of kinked tubing in  Figure 9-14 .) 6.	 Nuts at the end of the sensing elements  [Figure 9-15] should be inspected for tightness and the presence of  a safety wire. Loose nuts should be retorqued to the  value specified by the manufacturer’s instructions.  Some types of sensing element connection joints  require the use of copper crush gaskets, which should  be replaced any time a connection is separated. 7.	 If shielded flexible leads are used, they should be  inspected for fraying of the outer braid. The braided  sheath is composed of many fine metal strands woven  into a protective covering surrounding the inner  insulated wire. Continuous bending of the cable or  rough treatment can break these fine wires, especially  those near the connectors. 8.	 Sensing element routing and clamping should be  inspected carefully.  [Figure 9-14]  Long, unsupported  sections may permit excessive vibration that can cause  breakage. The distance between clamps on straight  runs, usually about 8–10 inches, is specified by the  manufacturer. At end connectors, the first support  clamp is usually located about four to six inches from

the end connector fittings. In most cases, a straight run  of one inch is maintained from all connectors before a  bend is started, and an optimum bend radius of three  inches is normally applied.  

9.	 Interference between a cowl brace and a sensing  element can cause rubbing.  [Figure 9-16]  This  interference may cause wear and short the sensing  element.  

10.	 Grommets should be installed on the sensing element  so that both ends are centered on its clamp. The split  end of the grommet should face the outside of the  nearest bend. Clamps and grommets should fit the  element snugly.  [Figure 9-17]  

![](images/8d813860c8100285613b1fee2a6afb27b9e6afb5a5312ecbf4905eefb9417365.jpg)

# Fire Detection System Troubleshooting  

The following troubleshooting procedures represent the  most common difficulties encountered in engine fire  detection systems:  

1.	 Intermittent alarms are most often caused by an  intermittent short in the detector system wiring. Such  shorts may be caused by a loose wire that occasionally  touches a nearby terminal, a frayed wire brushing  against a structure, or a sensing element rubbing  against a structural member long enough to wear  through the insulation. Intermittent faults often can  be located by moving wires to re-create the short.  

![](images/c81ea7831946256537b0d860b9e3fb8fd961409a68187c4ccd129687869f660f.jpg)

Figure 9-17.   Inspection of fire detector loop clamp.  

2.	 Fire alarms and warning lights can occur when no  engine fire or overheat condition exists. Such false  alarms can be most easily located by disconnecting  the engine sensing loop connections from the control  unit. If the false alarm ceases when the engine sensing  loop is disconnected, the fault is in the disconnected  sensing loop, which should be examined for areas  that have been bent into contact with hot parts of the  engine. If no bent element can be found, the shorted  section can be located by isolating the connecting  elements consecutively around the entire loop.  

3.	 Kinks and sharp bends in the sensing element can  cause an internal wire to short intermittently to the  outer tubing. The fault can be located by checking the  sensing element with an ohm meter while tapping the  element in the suspected areas to produce the short.  

4.	 Moisture in the detection system seldom causes a  false fire alarm. If, however, moisture does cause an  alarm, the warning persists until the contamination is  removed or boils away, and the resistance of the loop  returns to its normal value.  

5.	 Failure to obtain an alarm signal when the test switch  is actuated may be caused by a defective test switch or  control unit, the lack of electrical power, inoperative  indicator light, or an opening in the sensing element  or connecting wiring. When the test switch fails to  provide an alarm, the continuity of a two-wire sensing  loop can be determined by opening the loop and  measuring the resistance. In a single-wire, continuous- loop system, the center conductor should be grounded.  

# Fire Extinguisher System Maintenance  Practices  

Regular maintenance of fire extinguisher systems typically  includes such items as the inspection and servicing of fire  extinguisher bottles (containers), removal and reinstallation  of cartridge and discharge valves, testing of discharge tubing  for leakage, and electrical wiring continuity tests. The  following paragraphs contain details of some of the most  typical maintenance procedures.  

Fire extinguisher containers are checked periodically to  determine that the pressure is between the prescribed  minimum and maximum limits. Changes of pressure with  ambient temperatures must also fall within prescribed  limits. The graph shown in  Figure 9-18  is typical of the  pressure temperature curve graphs that provide maximum  and minimum gauge readings. If the pressure does not fall  within the graph limits, the extinguisher container is replaced. The service life of fire extinguisher discharge cartridges is  calculated from the manufacturer’s date stamp, which is  usually placed on the face of the cartridge. The cartridge  service life recommended by the manufacturer is usually in  terms of years. Cartridges are available with a service life  of 5 years or more. To determine the unexpired service life  of a discharge cartridge, it is usually necessary to remove  the electrical leads and discharge line from the plug body,  which can then be removed from the extinguisher container.  

![](images/b99bfb3bcc4ee9dfb146a131b60dc9305dcfe122f237aa825f5c133d9a78fd6c.jpg)  
Figure 9-18.   Fire extinguisher container pressure-temperature chart.  

Be careful when replacing cartridge and discharge valves.  Most new extinguisher containers are supplied with  their cartridge and discharge valve disassembled. Before  installation on the aircraft, properly assemble the cartridge  in the discharge valve and connect the valve to the container,  usually by means of a swivel nut that tightens against a  packing ring gasket.  [Figure 9-19]  

If a cartridge is removed from a discharge valve for any  reason, it should not be used in another discharge valve  assembly, since the distance the contact point protrudes may  vary with each unit. Thus, continuity might not exist if a used  plug that had been indented with a long contact point were  installed in a discharge valve with a shorter contact point.  

The preceding material in this chapter is general in nature,  addressing the principles involved and general procedures to  be followed. When actually performing maintenance, always  refer to the applicable maintenance manuals and other related  publications pertaining to a particular aircraft.  

# Boeing 777 Aircraft Fire Detection &  Extinguishing System  

The following section discusses the fire detection and  extinguishing system of the B777 aircraft. The information  is included only for familiarization purposes.  

Each engine has two fire detection loops: loop 1 and loop  2. A fire detection card in the system card file monitors the  loops for fires, overheat conditions, and faults. There is a fire  detection card for each engine.  

# Overheat Detection  

If the fire detection loops detect an overheat condition, the  fire detection card sends a signal to the AIMS and to the  warning electronics unit. The following indications occur  in the flight deck:  

•	 The master caution lights come on. •	 The caution aural operates. •	 An engine overheat caution message shows.  

# Fire Detection  

If an engine fire occurs, the fire detection card sends a  signal to the AIMS and to the warning electronics unit, and  a warning message illuminates. The following indications  occur in the flight deck:  

•	 The master warning lights come on. •	 The fire warning aural operates. •	 An engine fire warning message shows. •	 The engine fire warning light comes on.  

![](images/260aa4bb9d112ee4e23e3fa22708fe96ed35eb36340e281f3bf3e36fd82aa73f.jpg)  
Figure 9-19.  Components of fire extinguisher container.  

•	 The fuel control switch fire warning light comes on.  

# Nacelle Temperature Recording  

The fire detection card measures the average temperature of  the loops. This data goes to the AIMS through the system’s  ARINC 629 buses and is recorded by the aircraft condition  monitoring function.  

# Continuous Fault Monitoring  

The fire detection card monitors the two loops and their  wiring for defects. In normal (dual loop) operation, both  loops must have a fire or overheat condition to cause the  flight deck indications.  

If a failure occurs in a loop, the fire detection card sends the  data to the AIMS. A status message shows, and the system  changes to single-loop operation. In this mode, fire/overheat  indications occur when one loop is defective and the other  has a fire or overheat condition.  

# Single/Dual Loop Operation  

The fire detection card monitors the loops for faults. In  normal (dual loop) operation, both loops must have a fire or  overheat condition to cause the flight deck indications. If one  detection loop fails, the card sends data about the failure to  the AIMS, and a status message shows. The card changes to  single-loop operation, if necessary. If both detection loops  fail, an advisory message and status messages are displayed,  and the fire detection system does not operate.  

# System Test  

Built-in test equipment (BITE) performs a test of the engine  fire detection system for these conditions:  

•	 When the system first gets power. •	 After a power interrupt. •	 Every 5 minutes of operation.  [Figures 9-20  and  9-21]  

# Boeing 777 Fire Extinguisher System Fire Extinguisher Containers  

The B777 aircraft has two fire extinguishing bottles that  contain Halon fire extinguishing agent pressurized with  nitrogen. The engine fire switches in the flight deck are pulled  and rotated to release the Halon. Halon from each bottle can  be discharged to the right or left engine. Engine indicating  and crew alerting system (EICAS) messages, status messages,  and indicator lights show when the bottle pressure is low. The  two engine fire extinguishing bottles are located behind the  right sidewall lining of the forward cargo compartment, aft  of the cargo door.  [Figure 9-22]  

The two engine fire extinguishing bottles are identical. Each  bottle has these following components:  

•	 A safety relief and fill port, •	 A handle for removal and installation, •	 A pressure switch, •	 Two discharge assemblies, •	 An identification plate, and •	 Four mounting lugs.  [Figures 9-23, 9-24, 9-25]  

The bottles contain Halon fire extinguishing agent pressurized  with nitrogen. If the pressure in the bottle becomes too high,  the safety relief and fill port opens so that the bottle does not  explode. The discharge assembly has an explosive squib. An  electric current from the fire extinguishing circuit fires the  squib. This releases the Halon through the discharge port.  The pressure switch gives flight deck indications when bottle  pressure decreases. The switch monitors the pressure inside  the bottle and is normally open. When the pressure decreases  because of a leak or bottle discharge, the switch closes an  indicating circuit.

Figure 9-23.   Fire extinguishing bottle.  

# Squib  

The squib is installed in the discharge assembly at the bottom  of the fire container. A fire container has two squibs, one for  each engine. The squib is an electrically operated explosive  device. When the squib is activated, it fires a slug through  the breakable disc, and nitrogen pressure inside the bottle  pushes the Halon through the discharge port. The squib fires  when the fire switch is pulled and turned to the DISCH 1 or  DISCH 2 position.  [Figure 9-22]  

# Engine Fire Switches  

The engine fire panel is in the flight deck on the P8 aisle stand.  The engine fire panel has a fire switch for each engine and a  discharge light for each fire bottle.  [Figure 9-26]  

The engine fire switch has four functions:  

•	 Gives an indication of an engine fire, •	 Stops the engine, •	 Isolates the engine from the aircraft systems, and •	 Controls the engine fire extinguishing system.  

The fire switch assembly incorporates a solenoid that locks  the fire switch so that the flight crew cannot pull it accidently.  If an engine has a fire, the fire warning light comes on and the  solenoid energizes to release the switch. When the solenoid  is energized, the fire switch can be pulled.  

When the fire detection system malfunctions or the solenoid  is defective, and the flight crew wants to extinguish an engine  fire, someone must push the fire override switch. The fire  override switch allows the fire switch to be pulled when the  solenoid is not energized. When the fire switch is pulled, the  push-pull switch contacts operate electrical circuits that stop  the engine and isolate it from the aircraft systems. With the  switch pulled, it can be rotated to left or right to a mechanical  stop at the discharge position. The rotary switch contacts  close and operate the fire extinguishing system.  

When the fire switch is pulled, the switch isolates the  following aircraft systems from the engine:  

•	 Closes the fuel spar valve. •	 Deenergizes the engine fuel metering unit (FMU)  cutoff solenoid. •	 Closes the engine hydraulic pump shutoff valve. •	 Depressurizes the engine driven hydraulic pump valve. •	 Closes the pressure regulator and shutoff valve. •	 Removes power from thrust reverser isolation valve. •	 Trips the generator field. •	 Trips the backup generator field.  [Figure 9-27]

# Engine Fire Operation  

If an engine has a fire, the engine fire detection system gives a  fire warning in the flight deck. The engine fire warning lights  come on to identify which fire switch to use to extinguish the  fire. The solenoid in the fire switch energizes and releases the  switch so that the fire switch can be pulled. If the solenoid  does not energize, push the fire override switch to release  the fire switch manually. When the fire switch is pulled, it stops the engine, and the fire switch isolates the engine from  the aircraft systems.  

If the fire warnings do not go away when the switch is pulled,  position the switch to the DISCH 1 or DISCH 2 position, and  hold the switch against the stop for one second. This fires  the squib in the fire extinguisher container and releases the  fire extinguishing agent into the engine nacelle. Ensure that  the engine bottle discharge light comes on. If the first bottle  does not extinguish the fire, the switch must be placed to the  other DISCH position. This fires the squib for the other bottle.  

# APU Fire Detection & Extinguishing System  

The APU fire protection system is similar in design to engine  fire protection systems, but there are some differences.  The APU is often operated with no personnel in the flight  

![](images/ec5325a78ddc55eb7686687c2a5dc9a09c00aca4980f4dbbd226dac1f918778a.jpg)  
Figure 9-27.   Engine fire switch circuit.  

deck and; the APU fire protection system can operate in  an unattended mode on the ground with the engines not  running. If there is an APU fire in the unattended mode, the  fire extinguisher discharges automatically. The APU operates  in the attended mode when at least one engine is running. If  there is an APU fire in this mode, the crew discharges the  bottle manually. Fire switches are located on the cargo fire/ engine control panel and the service and APU shutdown  panel located outside the aircraft on the nose landing gear.  [Figure 9-28]  

switch against the discharge stop for one second. This fires  the bottle squib and releases the fire extinguishing agent into  the APU compartment. Verify that the APU bottle discharge  light comes on.  [Figure 9-29]  

# APU Fire Warning  

If there is an APU fire, the APU fire detection system gives  fire warnings and automatically stops the APU. The APU fire  warning light comes on to identify the correct fire switch to  use to extinguish the fire. The fire switch solenoid releases  the switch so that it can be pulled up. If the APU is running,  it stops when the fire switch is pulled. The fire switch isolates  the APU from the aircraft systems.  

# Fire Bottle Discharge  

If the fire warnings do not go away with the switch out,  put the switch to the left or right DISCH position. Hold the

# Reciprocating Engine Overhaul  

Both maintenance and complete engine overhauls are  performed normally at specified intervals. This interval is  usually governed by the number of hours the powerplant  has been in operation. The actual overhaul period for a  specific engine is generally determined by the manufacturer’s  recommendations. Each engine manufacturer sets a total  time in service when the engine should be removed from  service and overhauled. Depending upon how the engine  is used in service, the overhaul time can be mandatory. The  overhaul time is listed in hours and is referred to as time  before overhaul (TBO). For example, if an engine had a life  of 2,000 hours and had operated 500 hours, it would have a  TBO of 1,500 hours. Tests and experience have shown that  operation beyond this period of time could result in certain  parts being worn beyond their safe limits. For an overhauled  engine to be as airworthy as a new one, worn parts, as well  as damaged parts, must be detected and replaced during  overhaul. The only way to detect all unairworthy parts is to  perform a thorough and complete overhaul process while the  engine is disassembled. The major purpose of overhaul is to  inspect, repair, and replace worn engine parts.  

A complete overhaul process includes the following ten  steps: receiving inspection; disassembly; visual inspection;  cleaning; structural inspection; non-destructive testing (NDT)  inspection; dimensional inspection; repair and replacement;  reassembly; and testing and break in. The inspection phases  are the most precise and the most important phases of the  overhaul. Inspection cannot be slighted or performed in a  careless or incomplete manner. It is always recommended  that complete records be made of the inspection process and  kept with the engine records.  

Each engine manufacturer provides very specific tolerances  to which the engine parts must conform and provides general  instructions to aid in determining the airworthiness of the  part. However, in many cases, the final determination must  be made by the technician. Although the determination must  be made if the part is serviceable, repairable, or should be  rejected, the technician should follow the manufacturer’s  manuals and information. When dimensional tolerances  are concerned, the manufacturer publishes a new minimum  and serviceable dimension for all critical component parts.  Knowledge of the operating principles, strength, and stresses  applied to a part is essential in making decisions regarding  visible wear. When the powerplant technician signs the release  for the return to service for an overhauled engine, this certifies  that the complete overhaul process has been performed using  methods, techniques, and practices acceptable to the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator.  

# Top Overhaul  

Reciprocating piston aircraft engines can be repaired by a  top overhaul. This means an overhaul of those parts on top of  the crankcase, without completely dismantling the engine. It  includes removal of the units (i.e., exhaust collectors, ignition  harness, intake pipes) necessary to remove the cylinders. The  actual top overhaul consists of reconditioning the engine’s  cylinders by replacing or reconditioning the piston and  piston rings, and reconditioning or plating the cylinder wall  and valve-operating mechanism, including valve guides if  needed. A top overhaul is a little misleading, because it is  really an engine repair procedure and not a real overhaul  as described earlier. Usually at this time, the accessories  require no attention other than that normally required during  ordinary maintenance functions. This repair is generally due  to valves or piston rings wearing prematurely. Many stress  that if an engine requires this much dismantling, it should  be completely disassembled and receive a major overhaul.  

# Major Overhaul & Major Repairs  

Major overhaul consists of the complete reconditioning of  the powerplant. A reciprocating engine would require that the  crankcase be disassembled per the FAA; a major overhaul  is not generally a major repair. A certified powerplant-rated  technician can perform or supervise a major overhaul of an  engine if it is not equipped with an internal supercharger  or has a propeller reduction system other than spur-type  gears. At regular intervals, an engine should be completely  dismantled, thoroughly cleaned, and inspected. Each part  should be overhauled in accordance with the manufacturer’s  instructions and tolerances for the engine involved. At this  time all accessories are removed, overhauled, and tested.  Again, instructions from the manufacturer of the accessory  concerned should be followed.  

# General Overhaul Procedures  

Because of the continued changes and the many different  types of engines in use, it is not possible to treat the specific  overhaul of each engine in this text. However, there are  various overhaul practices and instructions of a nonspecific  nature that apply to all makes and models of engines.  

Any engine to be overhauled completely should receive a  runout check of its crankshaft or propeller shaft as a first  step. Any question concerning crankshaft or propeller shaft  replacement is resolved at this time, since a shaft whose  runout is beyond limits must be replaced.  

Throughout the life of a product (whether type-certificated  or not), manufacturing defects, changes in service, or  design improvements often occur. When that happens, the  OEM frequently uses a safety bulletin (SB) to distribute  the information to the operator of the aircraft. SBs are  good information and should be strongly considered by the  owner for implementation to the aircraft. However, SBs are  not required unless they are referred to in an airworthiness  directive (AD) note or if compliance is required as a part of  the authorized inspection program. Refer to 14 CFR part 39,  section 39.27.  

# Receiving Inspection  

The receiving inspection consists of determining the  general condition of the total engine as received, along with  an inventory of the engine’s components. The accessory  information should be recorded, such as model and serial  numbers, and the accessories should be sent to overhaul  if needed. The overhaul records should be organized, and  the appropriate manuals obtained and reviewed along with  a review of the engine’s history (log books). The engine’s  service bulletins, airworthiness directives, and type certificate  compliance should be checked. The exterior of the engine  should be cleaned after mounting it on an overhaul stand.  [Figure 10-1]  

# Disassembly  

As visual inspection immediately follows disassembly, all  individual parts should be laid out in an orderly manner on  a workbench as they are removed. To guard against damage  and to prevent loss, suitable containers should be available  in which to place small parts (nuts, bolts, etc.) during the  disassembly operation.  

Other practices to observe during disassembly include:  

1.	 Drain the engine oil sumps and remove the oil filter.  Drain the oil into a suitable container; strain it through  a clean cloth. Check the oil and the cloth for metal  particles. 2.	 Dispose of all safety devices (safety wire, cotter pins,  etc.) as they are removed. Never use them a second  time. Always replace with new safety devices.

Figure 10-1.   Engine mounted on an overhaul stand.  

3.	 All loose studs, and loose or damaged fittings, should  be carefully tagged to prevent being overlooked during  inspection. 4.	 Always use the proper tool for the job. Use sockets  and box end wrenches wherever possible. If special  tools are required, use them rather than improvising.  

# Inspection Process  

The inspection of engine parts during overhaul is divided  into three categories:  

1.	 Visual. 2.	 Structural. 3.	 Dimensional.  

Many defects on the engine components can be detected  visually, and a determination of airworthiness can be made  at this time. If, by visual inspection, the component is  determined to be unairworthy, the part is rejected, and no  further inspection or repair is required. Structural failures can  be determined by several different methods. Magnetic parts  can readily be examined by the magnetic particle method.  Other methods, such as dye penetrate, eddy current, ultra  sound, and X-ray, can also be used. The first two methods  are aimed at determining structural failures in the parts,  while the last method deals with the size and shape of each  part. By using very accurate measuring equipment, each  engine component can be dimensionally evaluated and  compared to service limits and standards (tolerances) set by  the manufacturer.  

# Visual Inspection  

Visual inspection should precede all other inspection  procedures. Parts should not be cleaned before a preliminary  visual inspection, since indications of a failure may often be  detected from the residual deposits of metallic particles in  some recesses in the engine.  

Several terms are used to describe defects detected in engine  parts during inspection. Some of the more common terms  and definitions are:  

1.	 Abrasion—an area of roughened scratches or marks  usually caused by foreign matter between moving  parts or surfaces. 2.	 Brinelling—one or more indentations on bearing races,  usually caused by high static loads or application of  force during installation or removal. Indentations are  rounded or spherical due to the impression left by the  contacting balls or rollers of the bearing. 3.	 Burning—surface damage due to excessive heat. It is  usually caused by improper fit, defective lubrication,  or over-temperature operation. 4.	 Burnishing—polishing of one surface by sliding  contact with a smooth, harder surface. Usually no  displacement nor removal of metal. 5.	 Burr—a sharp or roughened projection of metal  usually resulting from machine processing. 6.	 Chafing—a condition caused by a rubbing action  between two parts under light pressure that results in  wear. 7.	 Chipping—breaking away of pieces of material, that  is usually caused by excessive stress concentration or  careless handling. 8.	 Corrosion—loss of metal by a chemical or  electrochemical action. The corrosion products are  easily removed by mechanical means. Iron rust is an  example of corrosion. 9.	 Crack—a partial separation of material usually caused  by vibration, overloading, internal stresses, defective  assembly, or fatigue. Depth may be a few thousandths,  to the full thickness of the piece. 10.	 Cut—loss of metal, usually to an appreciable depth  over a relatively long and narrow area, by mechanical  means, as would occur with the use of a saw blade,  chisel, or sharp-edged stone striking a glancing blow. 11.	 Dent—a small, rounded depression in a surface usually  caused by the part being struck with a rounded object. 12.	 Erosion—loss of metal from the surface by mechanical  action of foreign objects, such as grit or fine sand. The  

eroded area is rough and may be lined in the direction  

13.	 Flaking—the breaking loose of small pieces of metal  or coated surfaces, that is usually caused by defective  plating or excessive loading.

 14.	 Fretting—a condition of surface erosion caused by  minute movement between two parts usually clamped  together with considerable unit pressure.

 15.	 Galling—a severe condition of chafing or fretting in  which a transfer of metal from one part to another  occurs. It is usually caused by a slight movement of  mated parts having limited relative motion and under  high loads.

 16.	 Gouging—a furrowing condition in which a  displacement of metal has occurred (a torn effect).  It is usually caused by a piece of metal, or foreign  material, between close moving parts.

 17.	 Grooving—a recess, or channel, with rounded and  smooth edges usually caused by faulty alignment  of parts.

 18.	 Inclusion—presence of foreign or extraneous material  entirely within a portion of metal. Such material is  introduced during the manufacture of rod, bar, or  tubing by rolling or forging.

 19.	 Nick—a sharp-sided gouge or depression with a  V-shaped bottom, that is generally the result of careless  handling of tools and parts.

 20.	 Peening—a series of blunt depressions in a surface.

 21.	 Pick up or scuffing—a buildup or rolling of metal  from one area to another, that is usually caused by  insufficient lubrication, clearances, or foreign matter.

 22.	 Pitting—small hollows of irregular shape in the  surface, usually caused by corrosion or minute  mechanical chipping of surfaces.

 23.	 Scoring—a series of deep scratches caused by foreign  particles between moving parts or careless assembly  or disassembly techniques.

 24.	 Scratches—shallow, thin lines or marks, varying in  degree of depth and width, caused by presence of fine  foreign particles during operation or contact with other  parts during handling.

 25.	 Stain—a change in color, locally, causing a noticeably  different appearance from the surrounding area.

 26.	 Upsetting—a displacement of material beyond the  normal contour or surface (a local bulge or bump).  Usually indicates no metal loss.  

These conditions are of particular importance when they  occur on the teeth; deep pit marks in this area are sufficient  cause to reject the gear. Bearing surfaces of all gears should be  free from deep scratches. However, minor abrasions usually  can be dressed out with a fine abrasive cloth.  

All bearing surfaces should be examined for scores, galling,  and wear. Considerable scratching and light scoring of  aluminum bearing surfaces in the engine do no harm and  should not be considered a reason for rejecting the part,  provided it falls within the clearances set forth in the table of  limits in the engine manufacturer’s overhaul manual. Even  though the part comes within the specific clearance limits, it is  not satisfactory for re-assembly in the engine unless inspection  shows the part to be free from other serious defects.  

Ball bearings should be inspected visually and by feel for  roughness, flat spots on balls, flaking or pitting of races, or  scoring on the outside of races. All journals should be checked  for galling, scores, misalignment, or out-of-round condition.  Shafts, pins, etc., should be checked for straightness. This  may be done, in most cases, by using V-blocks and a dial  indicator.  

Pitted surfaces in highly stressed areas, resulting from  corrosion, can cause ultimate failure of the part. The  following areas should be examined carefully for evidence  of such corrosion:  

1.	 Interior surfaces of piston pins. 2.	 The fillets at the edges of crankshaft main and crankpin  journal surfaces. 3.	 Thrust bearing races.  

If pitting exists on any of the surfaces mentioned, to the extent  that it cannot be removed by polishing with crocus cloth or  other mild abrasive, the part usually must be rejected.  

Parts, such as threaded fasteners or plugs, should be inspected  to determine the condition of the threads. Badly worn or  mutilated threads cannot be tolerated; the parts should be  rejected. However, small defects, such as slight nicks or burrs,  may be dressed out with a small file, fine abrasive cloth,  or stone. If the part appears to be distorted, badly galled,  mutilated by overtightening, or from the use of improper  tools, replace it with a new one.  

# Cylinder Head  

Inspect the cylinder head for internal and external cracks.  Use a bright light to inspect for cracks and investigate any  suspicious areas with a magnifying glass or microscope.  Carbon deposits must be cleaned from the inside of the  head, and paint must be removed from the outside for this  inspection.  

Exterior cracks show up on the head fins where they have  been damaged by tools or contact with other parts because  of careless handling. Cracks near the edge of the fins are not  dangerous, if the portion of the fin is removed and contoured  properly. Cracks at the base of the fin are a reason for rejecting  the cylinder. Cracks may also occur on the rocker box or in  the rocker bosses.  

Interior cracks almost always radiate from the valve seat  bosses or the spark plug bushing boss. These cracks are  usually caused by improper installation of the seats or  bushings. They may extend completely from one boss to  the other.  

Inspect all the studs on the cylinder head for looseness,  straightness, damaged threads, and proper length. Slightly  damaged threads may be chased with the proper die. The  length of the stud should be correct within   $\pm1/_{32}$   (0.03125)  inch to allow for proper installation of safety devices.  

Be sure the valve guides are clean before inspection. Often,  carbon covers pits inside the guide. If a guide in this condition  is put back in service, carbon again collects in the pits and  valve sticking results. Besides pits, scores, and burned areas  inside the valve guide, inspect them for wear or looseness.  

Inspection of valve seat inserts before they are re-faced is  mostly a matter of determining if there is enough of the seat  left to correct any pitting, burning, scoring, or out-of-trueness.  

Inspect the rocker shaft bosses for scoring, cracks, oversize,  or out-of-roundness. Scoring is generally caused by the rocker  shaft turning in the bosses, which means either the shaft was  too loose in the bosses or a rocker arm was too tight on the  shaft. Out-of-roundness is usually caused by a stuck valve.  If a valve sticks, the rocker shaft tends to work up and down  when the valve offers excessive resistance to opening. Inspect  for out-of-roundness and oversize using a telescopic gauge  and a micrometer.  

![](images/3231f54fac04cb1f33fd2b171e2f6366ab7add33e0872c8994ee630a62ac1931.jpg)  
Figure 10-2.   Checking a piston head for flatness.  

# Piston, Valve Train, & Piston Pin  

When applicable, check for flatness of the piston head  using a straightedge and thickness gauge.  [Figure 10-2]  If  a depression is found, check for cracks on the inside of the  piston. A depression in the top of the piston usually means  that detonation has occurred within the cylinder.  

Inspect the exterior of the piston for scores and scratches.  Scores on the top ring land are not cause for rejection, unless  they are excessively deep. Deep scores on the side of the  piston are usually a reason for rejection.  

Examine the piston for cracked skirts, broken ring lands,  and scored piston-pin holes. Do not mistake casting marks  or laps for a crack. During major overhaul, most pistons are  generally replaced, as it requires more labor to clean and  inspect the piston than it costs to replace it.  

# Crankshaft & Connecting Rods  

Carefully inspect all surfaces of the crankshaft for cracks.  Check the bearing surfaces for evidence of galling, scoring,  or other damage. When a shaft is equipped with oil transfer  tubes, check them for tightness.  

Visual inspection of connecting rods should be done with the  aid of a magnifying glass or bench microscope. A rod that is  obviously bent or twisted should be rejected without further  inspection. Inspect all surfaces of the connecting rods for  cracks, corrosion, pitting, galling, or other damage. Galling  is caused by a slight amount of movement between the  surfaces of the bearing insert and the connecting rod during  periods of high loading, such as that produced during over- speed or excessive manifold pressure operation. The visual  evidence produced by galling appears as if particles from  one contacting surface had welded to the other. Evidence  of any galling is sufficient reason for rejecting the complete  rod assembly. Galling is a distortion in the metal and is  comparable to corrosion in the manner in which it weakens  the metallic structure of the connecting rod.  

# Cleaning  

After visually inspecting engine recesses for deposits of metal  particles, it is important to clean all engine parts thoroughly  to facilitate further inspection. Two processes for cleaning  engine parts are:  

1.	 Degreasing to remove dirt and sludge (soft carbon). 2.	 The removal of hard carbon deposits by decarbonizing,  brushing or scraping, and grit-blasting.  

# Degreasing  

Degreasing can be done by immersing or spraying the part in a  suitable commercial solvent.  [Figure 10-3]  Extreme care must  be used if any water-mixed degreasing solutions containing  caustic compounds or soap are used. Such compounds, in  addition to being potentially corrosive to aluminum and  magnesium, may become impregnated in the pores of the  metal and cause oil foaming when the engine is returned to  service. Therefore, when using water-mixed solutions, it is  imperative that the parts be rinsed thoroughly and completely  in clear boiling water after degreasing. Regardless of the  method and type of solution used, coat or spray all parts with  lubricating oil immediately after cleaning to prevent corrosion.  

# Removing Hard Carbon  

While the degreasing solution removes dirt, grease, and soft  carbon, deposits of hard carbon almost invariably remain  on many interior surfaces. To remove these deposits, they  must first be loosened by immersion in a tank containing a  decarbonizing solution (usually heated). A great variety of  commercial decarbonizing agents are available. Decarbonizers,  like the degreasing solutions previously mentioned, fall  generally into two categories, water-soluble and hydrocarbons.  The same caution concerning the use of water-soluble  degreasers is applicable to water-soluble decarbonizers.  

Caution:  When using a decarbonizing solution on magnesium  castings, avoid immersing steel and magnesium parts in the  same decarbonizing tank, as this practice often results in  damage to the magnesium parts from corrosion.  

Decarbonizing will usually loosen most of the hard carbon  deposits remaining after degreasing. However, the complete  removal of all hard carbon generally requires brushing,  scraping, or grit-blasting. In all of these operations, be careful  to avoid damaging the machined surfaces. In particular, wire  brushes and metal scrapers must never be used on any bearing  or contact surface.  

![](images/62b8f0e3a2c888b30f9260ea4ddb71ed6667579d13e23e9008a4d58f914354d0.jpg)

blasting parts for the abrasive material being used. Sand,  rice, baked wheat, plastic pellets, glass beads, or crushed  walnut shells are examples of abrasive substances that are  used for grit-blasting parts. A grit-blasting machine is shown  in  Figure 10-4 .  

All machined surfaces must be masked properly and  adequately, and all openings tightly plugged before blasting.  The one exception to this is the valve seats, which may be  left unprotected when blasting the cylinder head combustion  chamber. It is often advantageous to grit-blast the seats, since  this will cut the glaze which tends to form (particularly on  the exhaust valve seat), thus facilitating subsequent valve  seat reconditioning. Piston ring grooves may be grit-blasted  if necessary; however, extreme caution must be used to  avoid the removal of metal from the bottom and sides of  the grooves. When grit-blasting housings, plug all drilled  oil passages with rubber plugs or other suitable material to  prevent the entrance of foreign matter.  

The decarbonizing solution will generally remove most of the  enamel on exterior surfaces. All remaining enamel should be  removed by grit-blasting, particularly in the crevices between  cylinder cooling fins.  

At the conclusion of cleaning operations, rinse the part in  petroleum solvent, dry and remove any loose particles of  carbon or other foreign matter by air-blasting, and apply a  liberal coating of preservative oil to all surfaces.  

Magnesium parts should be cleaned thoroughly with a  dichromate treatment prior to painting. This treatment  consists of cleaning all traces of grease and oil from the  part by using a neutral, noncorrosive degreasing medium  followed by a rinse, after which the part is immersed for at  least 45 minutes in a hot dichromate solution (three-fourths of  a pound of sodium dichromate to 1 gallon of water at  $180\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  

![](images/a1d03eaee9b21c3e3c459fa249a0a6b23d413ae0150f5fc35a4e3c53f65b490a.jpg)

to  $200~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ). Then the part should be washed thoroughly in  cold running water, dipped in hot water, and dried in an air  blast. Immediately thereafter, the part should be painted with  a prime coat and engine enamel in the same manner as that  suggested for aluminum parts.  

Some older engines used sludge chambers in the crankshafts,  which were manufactured with hollow crankpins that serve as  sludge removers. The sludge chambers require inspection and  cleaning at overhaul. Sludge chambers are formed by means  of spool-shaped tubes pressed into the hollow crankpins, or  by plugs pressed into each end of the crankpin. If an engine  has a sludge chamber or tubes, they must be removed for  cleaning at overhaul. If these are not removed, accumulated  sludge loosened during cleaning may clog the crankshaft  oil passages and cause subsequent bearing failures. If the  sludge chambers are formed by means of tubes pressed into  the hollow crankpins, make certain they are re-installed  correctly to avoid covering the ends of the oil passages. Due  to improved oils, sludge chambers are no longer used with  modern engines.  

# Structural Inspection  

One of the best methods to double check your visual  inspection findings is to supplement them with one of the  forms of nondestructive testing, such as magnetic particle,  dye penetrate, eddy current, ultrasound, and x-ray inspections.  Defects in nonmagnetic parts (aluminum parts) can be found  by all these methods except for magnetic particle inspection,  which is used for magnetic or ferrous materials (steel).  

# Dye Penetrant Inspection  

Dye penetrant inspection is a nondestructive test for defects  open to the surface in parts made of any nonporous material.  It is used with equal success on such metals as aluminum,  magnesium, brass, copper, cast iron, stainless steel, and  titanium. Dye penetrant inspection uses a penetrating liquid  that enters a surface opening and remains there, making it  clearly visible to the inspector. It calls for visual examination  of the part after it has been processed, increasing the visibility  of the defect so that it can be detected. Visibility of the  penetrating material is increased by the addition of one of two  types of dye: visible or fluorescent. When using a fluorescent  dye, the inspection is accomplished using an ultraviolet (UV)  light source (black light).  

The steps for performing a dye penetrant inspection are:  

1.	 Thorough cleaning of the metal surface. 2.	 Applying penetrant. 3.	 Removing penetrant with remover emulsifier or  cleaner.  

4.	 Drying the part. 5.	 Applying the developer. 6.	 Inspecting and interpreting results.  

# Eddy Current Inspection  

Eddy currents are composed of free electrons under the  influence of an induced electromagnetic field, that are made  to drift through metal. Different meter readings are seen when  the same metal is in different hardness states. Readings in the  affected area are compared with identical materials in known  unaffected areas for comparison. A difference in readings  indicates a difference in the hardness state of the affected  area. Eddy current inspection can frequently be performed  without removing the surface coatings, such as primer, paint,  and anodized films. It can be effective in detecting surface  and subsurface corrosion, pots, and heat treat condition.  

# Ultrasonic Inspection  

Ultrasonic detection equipment makes it possible to locate  defects in all types of materials. There are three basic  ultrasonic inspection methods:  

1.	 Pulse-echo. 2.	 Through transmission. 3.	 Resonance.  

# Pulse-Echo  

Flaws are detected by measuring the amplitude of signals  reflected and the time required for these signals to travel  between specific surfaces and the discontinuity.  

# Through Transmission  

Through transmission inspection uses two transducers, one to  generate the pulse and another placed on the opposite surface  to receive it. A disruption in the sound path indicates a flaw and  is displayed on the instrument screen. Through transmission  is less sensitive to small defects than the pulse-echo method.  

# Resonance  

This system differs from the pulse-echo method, in that  the frequency of transmission may be continuously varied.  The resonance method is principally used for thickness  measurements when the two sides of the material being tested  are smooth and parallel, and the backside is inaccessible. The  point at which the frequency matches the resonance point of  the material being tested is the thickness determining factor.  

# Magnetic Particle Inspection  

Magnetic particle inspection is a method of detecting invisible  cracks and other defects in ferromagnetic materials, such as  iron and steel. It is not applicable to nonmagnetic materials.  

The inspection process consists of magnetizing the part, and  then applying ferromagnetic particles to the surface area to be  inspected. The ferromagnetic particles (indicating medium)  may be held in suspension in a liquid that is flushed over the  part; the part may be immersed in the suspension liquid; or  the particles, in dry powder form, may be dusted over the  surface of the part. The wet process is more commonly used  in the inspection of aircraft parts.  

If a discontinuity is present, the magnetic lines of force  are disturbed, and opposite poles exist on either side of the  discontinuity. The magnetized particles form a pattern in  the magnetic field between the opposite poles. This pattern,  known as an indication, assumes the approximate shape of  the surface projection of the discontinuity. A discontinuity  may be defined as an interruption in the normal physical  structure or configuration of a part.  

# X-ray  

X-rays can penetrate material and disclose discontinuities  through the metal or non-metal components, making it an  excellent inspection process when needed to determine the  structural integrity of an engine component. The penetrating  radiation is projected through the part to be inspected and  produces an invisible or latent image in the film. When  processed, the film becomes a radiograph, or shadow picture,  of the object. This inspection medium, as a portable unit,  provides a fast and reliable means for checking the integrity  of engine components.  

Additional and more thorough information on NDT inspection  is covered in detail in the Aviation Maintenance Technician  Handbook - General (FAA-H-8083-30, as amended).  

# Dimensional Inspection  

The dimensional inspection is used to assure that the engine’s  component parts and clearances meet the manufacturer’s  specifications. These specs are listed in a table of limits,  which lists serviceable limits and the manufacturer’s new part  maximum and minimum dimensions. Many measuring tools  are used to perform the dimensional inspection of the engine.  Some examples of these devices are discussed as the procedure  for measuring the engine’s components for dimensional  inspection is explained in the following paragraphs.  

# Cylinder Barrel  

Inspect the cylinder barrel for wear, using a cylinder bore  gauge  [Figure 10-5] , a telescopic gauge, and micrometer or  an inside micrometer. Dimensional inspection of the barrel  consists of the following measurements:  

1.	 Maximum taper of cylinder walls. 2.	 Maximum out-of-roundness.  

![](images/be9317660596a0169168532725bd4b69fb4c9c4f9ac92c2c6e4da9da6ded45a8.jpg)  
Figure 10-5.   A cylinder bore gauge.  

3.	 Bore diameter. 4.	 Step. 5.	 Fit between piston skirt and cylinder.  

All measurements involving cylinder barrel diameters must  be taken at a minimum of two positions   $90^{\circ}$   apart in the  particular plane being measured. It may be necessary to take  more than two measurements to determine the maximum  wear.  

Taper of the cylinder walls is the difference between the  diameter of the cylinder barrel at the bottom and the diameter  at the top. The cylinder is usually worn larger at the top than  at the bottom. This taper is caused by the natural wear pattern.  At the top of the stroke, the piston is subjected to greater heat  and pressure and more erosive environment than at the bottom  of the stroke. Also, there is greater freedom of movement  at the top of the stroke. Under these conditions, the piston  wears the cylinder wall more at the top of the cylinder. In  most cases, the taper ends with a ridge, that must be removed  during overhaul.  [Figure 10-6]  

Where cylinders are built with an intentional choke,  measurement of taper becomes more complicated. Cylinder  choke is where the top of the cylinder has been made with  the very top diameter of the cylinder smaller, to compensate  for wear and expansion during operation. It is necessary to  know exactly how the size indicates wear or taper. Taper  can be measured in any cylinder by a cylinder dial gauge  as long as there is not a sharp step. The dial gauge tends to  ride up on the step and causes inaccurate readings at the top  of the cylinder.  

The measurement for out-of-roundness is usually taken at the  top of the cylinder. However, a reading should also be taken  at the skirt of the cylinder to detect dents or bends caused by  careless handling. A step, or ridge, is formed in the cylinder  by the wearing action of the piston rings.  [Figure 10-6]  The  greatest wear is at the top of the ring travel limit. The ridge  that results is likely to cause damage to the rings or piston. If  the step exceeds tolerances, it should be removed by grinding  the cylinder oversize, or it should be blended by hand-stoning  to break the sharp edge.  

A step also may be found where the bottom ring reaches the  lowest travel. This step is rarely found to be excessive, but  it should be checked.  

Inspect the cylinder walls for rust, pitting, or scores. Mild  damage of this sort can be removed when the cylinders are  deglazed. With more extensive damage, the cylinder has to be  reground or honed. If the damage is too deep to be removed  by either of these methods, the cylinder usually will have to  be rejected. Most engine manufacturers, or engine overhaul  repair stations, have an exchange service on cylinders with  damaged barrels.  

Check the cylinder flange for warpage by placing the cylinder  on a suitable jig. Check to see that the flange contacts the jig  all the way around. The amount of warpage can be checked by  using a thickness gauge. A cylinder whose flange is warped  beyond the limits should be rejected.  

# Rocker Arms & Shafts  

Inspect the valve rockers for cracks and worn, pitted, or scored  tips. See that all oil passages are free from obstructions.  

Inspect the shaft’s diameter for correct size with a micrometer.  Rocker shafts are often found to be scored and burned because  of excessive turning in the cylinder head. Also, there may be  some pickup on the shaft (bronze from the rocker bushing  transferred to the steel shaft). Generally, this is caused  by overheating and too little clearance between shaft and  bushing. The clearance between the shaft and the bushing  is most important.  

Inspect the rocker arm bushing for correct size. Check for  proper clearance between the shaft and the bushing. Very  often the bushings are scored because of mishandling during  disassembly. Check to see that the oil holes line up. .At least   $50\%$   of the hole in the bushing should align with the hole in  the rocker arm.  

On engines that use a bearing, rather than a bushing, inspect  the bearing to make certain it has not been turning in the  rocker arm boss. Also inspect the bearing to determine its  serviceability.

# Crankshaft  

Use extreme care in inspecting and checking the crankshaft  for straightness. Place the crankshaft in V-blocks, supported  at the locations specified in the applicable engine overhaul  manual as in  Figure 10-7.  Using a surface plate and a dial  indicator, measure the shaft runout. If the total indicator  reading exceeds the dimensions given in the manufacturer’s  table of limits, the shaft must not be re-used. A bent crankshaft  should not be straightened. Any attempt to do so results  in rupture of the nitrided surface of the bearing journals,  a condition that causes eventual failure of the crankshaft.  Measure the outside diameter of the crankshaft main and rod- bearing journals using a micrometer.  [Figure 10-8]  Internal  measurements can be made by using telescoping gauges, and  then measuring the telescoping gauge with a micrometer.  [Figure 10-9]  Compare the resulting measurements with  those in the table of limits.  

# Checking Alignment  

Check bushings that have been replaced to determine if the  bushing and rod bores are square and parallel to each other.  The alignment of a connecting rod can be checked several  ways. One method requires a push fit arbor for each end of  the connecting rod, a surface plate, and two parallel blocks  of equal height.  

To measure rod squareness, or twist, insert the arbors into  the rod bores.  [Figure 10-10]  Place the parallel blocks on  

![](images/585d8f57a24ce7780c03cfbe328899532d8436fb70d79cb454649b23000a2db3.jpg)

a surface plate. Place the ends of the arbors on the parallel  blocks. Using a thickness gauge, check the clearance at the  points where the arbors rest on the blocks. This clearance,  divided by the separation of the blocks in inches, gives the  twist per inch of length.  

To determine bushing or bearing parallelism (convergence),  insert the arbors in the rod bores. Measure the distance  between the arbors on each side of the connecting rod at  points that are equidistant from the rod centerline. For exact  parallelism, the distances checked on both sides should be  the same. Consult the manufacturer’s table of limits for the  amount of misalignment permitted.  

The preceding operations are typical of those used for most  reciprocating engines and are included to introduce some  of the operations involved in engine overhaul. It would  be impractical to list all the steps involved in the overhaul  of an engine. It should be understood that there are other  operations and inspections that must be performed. For exact  information regarding a specific engine model, consult the  manufacturer’s overhaul manual.  

# Repair & Replacement  

The engine components that have failed inspection, or are  unrepairable, should have been discarded. The component  parts that need repair and replacement are now given the  attention required. The replacement components (new parts)  are organized and laid out for reassembly.  

Minor damage to engine parts, such as burrs, nicks, scratches,  scoring, or galling, should be removed with a fine oil stone,  crocus cloth, or any similar abrasive substance. Following  any repairs of this type, the part should be cleaned carefully  to be certain that all abrasive has been removed, and then  checked with its mating part to assure that the clearances  are not excessive. Flanged surfaces that are bent, warped,  or nicked can be repaired by lapping to a true surface on a  surface plate. Again, the part should be cleaned to be certain  that all abrasive has been removed. Defective threads can  sometimes be repaired with a suitable die or tap. Small  nicks can be satisfactorily removed with Swiss pattern files  or small, edged stones. Pipe threads should not be tapped  deeper to clean them, because this practice results in an  oversized tapped hole. If galling or scratches are removed  from a bearing surface of a journal, it should be buffed to a  high polished finish.  

In general, welding of highly-stressed engine parts can be  accomplished only when approved by the manufacturer.  However, welding may be accomplished using methods that  are approved by the engine manufacturer, and if it can be  reasonably expected that the welded repair will not adversely  affect the airworthiness of the engine.  

Many minor parts not subjected to high stresses may be  safely repaired by welding. Mounting lugs, cowl lugs,  cylinder fins, rocker box covers, and many parts originally  fabricated by welding are in this category. The welded part  should be suitably stress-relieved after welding. However,  before welding any engine part, consult the manufacturer’s  instructions for the engine concerned to see if it is approved  for repair by welding.  

Parts requiring use of paint for protection or appearance  should be repainted according to the engine manufacturer’s  recommendations. Aluminum alloy parts should have  original, exterior painted surfaces rubbed smooth to provide  a proper paint base. See that surfaces to be painted are  thoroughly cleaned. Care must be taken to avoid painting  mating surfaces. Exterior aluminum parts should be primed  first with a thin coat of zinc chromate primer. After the primer  is dry, parts should be painted with engine enamel, that should  be air dried until hard, or baked for  $\%$   hour at  $82\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\left(180\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\right)$  .  Aluminum parts from which the paint has not been removed  may be repainted without the use of a priming coat, provided  no bare aluminum is exposed.  

Any studs that are bent, broken, damaged, or loose must be  replaced. After a stud has been removed, the tapped stud hole  should be examined for size and condition of threads. If it  is necessary to re-tap the stud hole, it also is necessary to  use a suitable oversize stud. Studs that have been broken off  flush with the case must be drilled and removed with suitable  stud remover. Be careful not to damage any threads. When  replacing studs, coat the coarse threads of the stud with an  anti-seize compound.  

# Cylinder Assembly Reconditioning  

Cylinder and piston assemblies are inspected according  to the procedures contained in the engine manufacturer’s  manuals, charts, and service bulletins. A general procedure  for inspecting and reconditioning cylinders is discussed in  the following section to provide an understanding of the  operations involved.  

Visually inspect the head fins for other damage besides cracks.  Dents or bends in the fins should be left alone unless there  is danger of cracking. Where pieces of fin are missing, the  sharp edges should be filed to a smooth contour. Fin breakage  in a concentrated area causes dangerous local hot spots. Fin  breakage near the spark plug bushings or on the exhaust side  of the cylinder is obviously more dangerous than in other  areas. When removing or re-profiling a cylinder fin, follow  the instructions and the limits in the manufacturer’s manual.  

Inspect spark plug inserts for the condition of the threads  and for looseness. Run a tap of the proper size through the  bushing. Very often, the inside threads of the bushing are  burned. If more than one thread is missing, the bushing  should be rejected. Tighten a plug in the bushing to check  for looseness.  

# Piston & Piston Pins  

If the old piston is to be reused, or a new piston is to be used,  measure the outside of the piston by means of a micrometer.  Measurements must be taken in several directions and on  the skirt, as well as on the lands section. Check these sizes  against the cylinder size. Most engines use cam ground  pistons to compensate for the greater expansion parallel to  the pin during engine operation. The diameter of these pistons  measures several thousandths of an inch larger at an angle to  the piston pin hole, than parallel to the pin hole. Inspect the  ring grooves for evidence of wear. The groove needs to be  checked for side clearance with a feeler gauge to determine  the amount of wear in the grooves. Examine the piston pin  for scoring, cracks, excessive wear, and pitting. Check the  clearance between the piston pin and the bore of the piston  pin bosses using a telescopic gauge and a micrometer. Use  the magnetic particle method to inspect the pin for cracks.  Since the pins are often case hardened, cracks show up inside  the pin more often than they do on the outside. Check the pin  for bends using V-blocks and a dial indicator on a surface  plate.  [Figure 10-11]  Measure the fit of the plugs in the  pin. In many cases, the pistons and piston pins are routinely  replaced at overhaul.  

# Valves & Valve Springs  

The locations for checking runout and edge thickness of the  valves are shown in  Figure 10-12 . Measure the edge thickness  of valve heads. If, after re-facing, the edge thickness is less  than the limit specified by the manufacturer, the valve must  not be re-used. The edge thickness can be measured with  sufficient accuracy by a dial indicator and a surface plate.  

Using a magnifying glass, examine the valve in the stem area  and the tip for evidence of cracks, nicks, or other indications  of damage. This type of damage seriously weakens the  valve, making it susceptible to failure. If superficial nicks  and scratches on the valve indicate that it might be cracked,  inspect it using a structural inspection method described later.  Examine the valve springs for cracks, rust, broken ends, and  compression. Cracks can be located by visual inspection or  the magnetic particle method.

Figure 10-12.   Valve showing locations for checking runout and  section for measuring edge thickness.  

Critical areas of the valve include the face and tip  [Figure 10-13] , both of which should be examined for  pitting and excessive wear. Minor pitting on valve faces can  sometimes be removed by grinding.  

Inspect the valve for stretch and wear using a micrometer  or a valve radius gauge.  [Figure 10-14]  If a micrometer is  used, stretch is found as a smaller diameter of the valve stem  near the neck of the valve. Measure the diameter of the valve  stem and check the fit of the valve in its guide.  

Examine the valve visually for physical damage and damage  from burning or corrosion. Do not re-use valves that indicate  damage of this nature.  

Compression is tested with a valve spring compression tester.  [Figure 10-15]  The spring is compressed until its total height  is that specified by the manufacturer. The dial on the tester  should indicate the pressure, in pounds, required to compress  

![](images/20a841008813766b960db71cef1833be2bc3c318d0b8ce223da60e501d362d69.jpg)

the spring to the specified height. This must be within the  pressure limits established by the manufacturer.  

# Refacing Valve Seats  

The valve seat inserts of aircraft engine cylinders usually  are in need of refacing at every overhaul. They are refaced  to provide a true, clean, and correct size seat for the valve.  When valve guides or valve seats are replaced in a cylinder,  the seats must be made concentric with the valve guide.  

Low power engines can use either bronze or steel seats. Bronze  seats, although not widely used on current engines, are made  of aluminum bronze or phosphor bronze alloys. Steel seats  are commonly used for valve seats on higher powered engines  and are made of heat-resistant steel with a layer of stellite steel  alloy on the valve contact surface. Stellite seats can require a  special stone to grind this very hard material.  

Steel valve seats are refaced by grinding equipment.  [Figure 10-16]  Bronze seats are refaced preferably by the  use of cutters or reamers, but they may be ground when this  equipment is not available. The only disadvantage of using  a stone on bronze is that the soft metal loads the stone to  such an extent that much time is consumed in redressing the  stone to keep it clean.  

The equipment used on steel seats can be either wet or  dry valve seat grinding equipment. The wet grinder uses a  mixture of soluble oil and water to wash away the chips and  to keep the stone and seat cool; this produces a smoother,  more accurate job than the dry grinder. The stones may be  either silicon carbide or aluminum oxide.  

Before refacing the seat, make sure that the valve guide is in  good condition, clean, and does not have to be replaced. Mount  the cylinder firmly in the hold down fixture. An expanding

Figure 10-16.   Valve seat grinding equipment.  

pilot is inserted in the valve guide from the inside of the  cylinder, and an expander screw is inserted in the pilot from  the top of the guide.  [Figure 10-17]  The pilot must be tight in  the guide, because any movement can cause a poor grind. The  fluid hose is inserted through one of the spark plug inserts.  

The three grades of stones available for use are classified as  rough, finishing, and polishing stones. The rough stone is  designed to true and clean the seat. The finishing stone must  follow the rough to remove grinding marks and produce a  smooth finish. The polishing stone does just as the name  implies and is used only where a highly polished seat is desired.  

The stones are installed on special stone holders. The face  of the stone is trued by a diamond dresser. The stone should  be refaced whenever it is grooved or loaded, and when the  stone is first installed on the stone holder. The diamond  dresser also may be used to cut down the diameter of the  stone. Dressing of the stone should be kept to a minimum  as a matter of conservation; therefore, it is desirable to have  sufficient stone holders for all the stones to be used on the job.  

In the actual grinding job, considerable skill is required  in handling the grinding gun. The gun must be centered  accurately on the stone holder. If the gun is tilted off- center, chattering of the stone results, and a rough grind is  produced. It is very important that the stone be rotated at a  speed that permits grinding instead of rubbing. This speed is  approximately 8,000 to 10,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).  Excessive pressure on the stone can slow it down. It is not a  good technique to let the stone grind at slow speed by putting  pressure on the stone when starting or stopping the gun. The  maximum pressure used on the stone at any time should be  no more than that exerted by the weight of the gun.  

![](images/24c130ad0966229cfb3c52fb79b8e3dc311583d8966f01821a5d3bce4eb46d47.jpg)  
Figure 10-17.   Valve seat grinding setup.  

Another practice, conducive to good grinding, is to ease off  on the stone every second or so to let the coolant wash away  the chips on the seat. This rhythmic grinding action also  helps keep the stone up to its correct speed. Since it is quite  a job to replace a seat, remove as little material as possible  during the grinding. Inspect the job frequently to prevent  unnecessary grinding.  

The rough stone is used until the seat is true to the valve  guide and until all pits, scores, or burned areas are removed.  [Figure 10-18]  After refacing, the seat should be smooth  and true. The finishing stone is used only until the seat has a  smooth, polished appearance. Extreme caution should be used  when grinding with the finishing stone to prevent chattering.  

The size and trueness of the seat can be checked by several  methods. Runout of the seat is checked with a special dial  indicator and should not exceed 0.002 inch. The size of the  seat may be determined by using Prussian blue. Prussian  blue is used to check for contact transfer from one surface  to the other. To check the fit of the seat, spread a thin coat  of Prussian blue evenly on the seat. Press the valve onto the  seat. The blue transferred to the valve indicates the contact  surface. The contact surface should be one-third to two-thirds  the width of the valve face and in the middle of the face. In  some cases, a-go and no-go gauge is used in place of the valve  when making the Prussian blue check. If Prussian blue is  not used, the same check may be made by lapping the valve  lightly to the seat. Lapping is accomplished by using a small  amount of lapping compound placed between the valve face  and seat. The valve is then moved in a rotary motion back  and forth until the lapping compound grinds slightly into the   surface. After cleaning the lapping contact compound off, a  contact area can be seen. Examples of test results are shown  in  Figure 10-19 .  

If the seat contacts the upper third of the valve face, grind off  the top corner of the valve seat.  [Figure 10-20]  Such grinding  is called narrowing grinding. This permits the seat to contact  the center third of the valve face without touching the upper  portion of the valve face.  

If the seat contacts the bottom third of the valve face, grind  off the inner corner of the valve seat.  [Figure 10-21]  The  seat is narrowed by a stone other than the standard angle. It  is common practice to use a  $15^{\circ}$   angle and  $45^{\circ}$   angle cutting  stone on a  $30^{\circ}$   angle valve seat, and a  $30^{\circ}$   angle and  $75^{\circ}$   angle  stone on a   $45^{\circ}$   angle valve seat.  [Figure 10-22]  

If the valve seat has been cut or ground too much, the valve  contacts the seat too far up into the cylinder head, and the   valve clearance, spring tension, and the fit of the valve to  the seat is affected. To check the height of a valve, insert the  valve into the guide, and hold it against the seat. Check the  height of the valve stem above the rocker box or some other  fixed position.  

Before refacing a valve seat, consult the overhaul manual  for the particular model engine. Each manufacturer specifies  the desired angle for grinding and narrowing the valve seat.  

# Valve Reconditioning  

One of the most common jobs during engine overhaul is  grinding the valves. The equipment used should preferably  be a wet valve grinder. With this type of machine, a mixture  of soluble oil and water is used to keep the valve cool and  carry away the grinding chips.  

Like many machine jobs, valve grinding is mostly a matter  of setting up the machine. The following points should be  checked or accomplished before starting a grind. True the  stone by means of a diamond nib. The machine is turned on,  and the diamond is drawn across the stone, cutting just deep  enough to true and clean the stone. Determine the face angle  of the valve being ground and set the movable head of the  machine to correspond to this valve angle. Usually, valves  are ground to the standard angles of  $30^{\circ}$   or  $45^{\circ}$  . However, in  some instances, an interference fit of  $0.5^{\circ}$   or   $1.5^{\circ}$   less than  the standard angle may be ground on the valve face.  

![](images/a8bcde6069592db92b4833dfc2262416099db5d4718c6f3eb71e1b9a03ec68d4.jpg)

Figure 10-22.   Valve seat angles.  

The interference fit is used to obtain a more positive seal by  means of a narrow contact surface.  [Figure 10-23]  Theoretically,  there is a line contact between the valve and seat. With this  line contact, the load that the valve exerts against the seat  is concentrated in a very small area, thereby increasing the  unit load at any one spot. The interference fit is especially  beneficial during the first few hours of operation after an  overhaul. The positive seal reduces the possibility of a burned  valve or seat that a leaking valve might produce. After the  first few hours of running, these angles tend to pound down  and become identical.  

Notice that the interference angle is ground into the valve, not  the seat. It is easier to change the angle of the valve grinder  work head than to change the angle of a valve seat grinder  stone. Do not use an interference fit unless the manufacturer  approves it.  

![](images/a94de3f4e0caa7dcf291eda73efe53003d513877d7805b55b0fc4792bb2c2b07.jpg)  
Figure 10-23.   Interference fit of valve and valve seat.  

Install the valve into the chuck and adjust the chuck so that  the valve face is approximately 2 inches from the chuck.  [Figure 10-24]  If the valve is chucked any further out,  there is danger of excessive wobble and also a possibility of  grinding into the stem.  

There are various types of valve grinding machines. In one  type, the stone is moved across the valve face; in another, the  valve is moved across the stone. Whichever type is used, the  following procedures are typical of those performed when  refacing a valve.  

![](images/5f5f629aabaca3617c017c2017c6549ca8b0a8ac36c68a052d2c5fbd78bf0467.jpg)  
Figure 10-24.   Valve installed in grinding machine.  

Check the travel of the valve face across the stone. The valve  should completely pass the stone on both sides, yet not travel  far enough to grind the stem. There are stops on the machine  that can be set to control this travel.  

With the valve set correctly in place, turn on the machine and  the grinding fluid so that it splashes on the valve face. Back  the grinding wheel off all the way. Place the valve directly  in front of the stone.  [Figure 10-25]  Slowly bring the wheel  forward until a light cut is made on the valve. The intensity  of the grind is measured by sound more than anything else.  Slowly draw the valve back and forth across the stone without  increasing the cut. Move the work head table back and forth  using the full face of the stone, but always keep the valve  face on the stone. When the sound of the grind diminishes,  indicating that some valve material has been removed, move  the workhead table to the extreme left to stop rotation of the  valve. Inspect the valve to determine if further grinding is  necessary. If another cut must be made, bring the valve in  

![](images/b82153170a46ab03e3236ea06c93fbf6df0773b4373517363b571a9ea168887f.jpg)  
Figure 10-25.   Valve in chuck ready to grind.  

front of the stone, then advance the stone out to the valve.  Do not increase the cut without having the valve directly in  front of the stone.  

An important precaution in valve grinding, as in any kind  of grinding, is to make light cuts only. Heavy cuts cause  chattering, that may make the valve surface so rough that  much time is lost in obtaining the desired finish.  

After grinding, check the valve margin to be sure that the  valve edge has not been ground too thin. A thin edge is called  a feather edge and can lead to pre-ignition; the valve edge  would burn away in a short period of time, and the cylinder  would have to be overhauled again.  Figure   ${\it l}\it0\mathrm{-}26$   shows a  valve with a normal margin and one with a feather edge.  

The valve tip may be resurfaced on the valve grinder. The  tip is ground to remove cupping or wear, and also to adjust  valve clearances on some engines.  

![](images/5b1ddb895eadc0f0b315899cbaaec0cb12a997a28be7b22d3b4404e54297873d.jpg)  
Figure 10-26.   Engine valves showing normal margin and a feather  edge.  

The valve is held by a clamp on the side of the stone.  [Figure 10-27]  With the machine and grinding fluid turned on,  the valve is pushed lightly against the stone and swung back  and forth. Do not swing the valve stem off either edge of the  stone. Because of the tendency for the valve to overheat during  this grinding, be sure plenty of grinding fluid covers the tip.  

Grinding of the valve tip may remove, or partially remove,  the bevel on the edge of the valve. To restore this bevel,  mount a V-way approximately   $45^{\circ}$   to the grinding stone.  Hold the valve onto the V-way and twist the valve tip onto  the stone. With a light touch, grind all the way around the  tip. This bevel prevents scratching the valve guide when the  valve is installed.  

# Valve Lapping & Leak Testing  

After the grinding procedure is finished, it is sometimes  necessary that the valve be lapped to the seat. This is done by  applying a small amount of lapping compound to the valve  face, inserting the valve into the guide, and rotating the valve  with a lapping tool until a smooth, gray finish appears at the  contact area. The appearance of a correctly lapped valve is  shown in  Figure 10-28 .  

After the lapping process is finished, be sure that all lapping  compound is removed from the valve face, seat, and adjacent  areas. The final step is to check the mating surface for leaks  to see if it is sealing properly. This is done by installing the  valve in the cylinder, holding the valve by the stem with the  fingers, and pouring kerosene or solvent into the valve port.  While holding finger pressure on the valve stem, check to see  if the kerosene is leaking past the valve into the combustion  chamber. If it is not, the valve re-seating operation is  finished. If kerosene is leaking past the valve, continue the  lapping operation until the leakage is stopped. The incorrect  indications are of value in diagnosing improper valve and  valve seat grinding. Incorrect indications, their cause, and  remedy are shown in  Figure 10-29 .

# Piston Repairs  

Piston repairs are not required as often as cylinder repairs  since most of the wear is between the piston ring and cylinder  wall, valve stem and guide, and valve face and seat. A lesser  amount of wear is encountered between the piston skirt and  cylinder, ring and ring groove, or piston pin and bosses.  

The most common repair is the removal of scores. Usually,  these may be removed only on the piston skirt if they  are very light. On engines where the entire rotating and  reciprocating assembly is balanced, the pistons must weigh  within one-fourth ounce of each other. When a new piston is  installed, it must be within the same weight tolerance as the  one removed. It is not enough to have the pistons matched  alone; they must be matched to the crankshaft, connecting  rods, piston pins, etc. To make weight adjustments on new  pistons, the manufacturer provides a heavy section at the  base of the skirt. To decrease weight, file metal evenly off  the inside of this heavy section. The piston weight can be  decreased easily, but welding, metalizing, or plating cannot  be done to increase the piston weight.  

If ring grooves are worn or stepped, the pistons are normally  replaced. Small nicks on the edge of the piston pin boss may be  sanded down. Deep scores inside the boss, or anywhere around  the boss, are definite reasons for rejection. It has become more  economical to replace pistons rather than reconditioning and  reusing old ones, especially during overhaul.  

# Cylinder Grinding & Honing  

If a cylinder has excessive taper, out-of-roundness, step, or  its maximum size is beyond limits, it can be reground to  the next allowable oversize. If the cylinder walls are lightly  rusted, scored, or pitted, the damage may be removed by  honing or lapping.  

Regrinding a cylinder is a specialized job that the powerplant  mechanic is not usually expected to be able to do. However,  

![](images/3e81ea498ce7f000cabac223ccaaecf87e6d13d0b0ff064d4a00ebe1b7806c27.jpg)  
Figure 10-29.   Incorrectly lapped valves.  

the mechanic must be able to recognize when a cylinder  needs regrinding, and they must know what constitutes a  good or bad job.  

Generally, standard aircraft cylinder oversizes are 0.010 inch,  0.015 inches, 0.020 inch, or 0.030 inch. Aircraft cylinders  have relatively thin walls and may have a nitrided surface,  that must not be ground away. Nitriding is a surface hardening  process that hardens the steel surface to a depth of several  thousandths of an inch. Any one manufacturer usually does  not allow all of the above oversizes. Some manufacturers do  not allow regrinding to an oversize at all. The manufacturer’s  overhaul manual, or parts catalog, usually lists the oversizes  allowed for a particular make and model engine.  

To determine the regrind size, the standard bore size  must be known. This usually can be determined from the  manufacturer’s specifications or manuals. The regrind size is  figured from the standard bore. For example, a certain cylinder  has a standard bore of 3.875 inches. To have a cylinder ground  to 0.015 inches oversize, it is necessary to grind to a bore  diameter of 3.890 inch   $(3.875+0.015)$  . A tolerance of  $\pm0.0005$    inches is usually accepted for cylinder grinding.  

Another factor to consider when determining the size to which  a cylinder must be reground is the maximum wear that has  occurred. If there are spots in the cylinder wall that are worn  larger than the first oversize, then obviously it is necessary  to grind to the next oversize to clean up the entire cylinder.  

The type of finish desired in the cylinder is an important  consideration when ordering a regrind. Some engine  manufacturers specify a fairly rough finish on the cylinder  walls, that allows the rings to seat even if they are not lapped  to the cylinder. Other manufacturers desire a smooth finish  to which a lapped ring seats without much change in ring  or cylinder dimensions. The latter type of finish is more  expensive to produce.  

The standard used when measuring the finish of a cylinder  wall is known as micro-inch root mean square (micro-inch  RMS). In a finish where the depth of the grinding scratches  are one-millionth (0.000001) of an inch deep, it is specified  as 1 micro-inch RMS. Most aircraft cylinders are ground to  a finish of 15 to 20 micro-inch RMS. Several low-powered  engines have cylinders that are ground to a relatively  rough 20- to 30-micro-inch RMS finish. On the other end  of the scale, some manufacturers require a superfinish of  approximately 4- to 6-micro-inch RMS.  

Cylinder grinding is accomplished by a firmly mounted stone  that revolves around the cylinder bore, as well as up and down  the length of the cylinder barrel.  [Figure 10-30]  The cylinder,  the stone, or both may move to get this relative movement.  The size of the grind is determined by the distance the stone  is set away from the centerline of the cylinder. Some cylinder  bore grinding machines produce a perfectly straight bore,  while others are designed to grind a choked bore. A choked  bore grind refers to the manufacturing process in which  the cylinder walls arc ground to produce a smaller internal  diameter at the top than at the bottom. The purpose of this  type grind or taper is to maintain a straight cylinder wall  during operation. As a cylinder heats up during operation,  the head and top of the cylinder are subjected to more heat  than the bottom. This causes greater expansion at the top than  at the bottom, thereby maintaining the desired straight wall.  

After grinding a cylinder, it may be necessary to hone the  cylinder bore to produce the desired finish. In this case,  specify the cylinder regrind size to allow for some metal  removal during honing. The usual allowance for honing is  0.001 inch. If a final cylinder bore size of 3.890 inches is  desired, specify the regrind size of 3.889 inches, and then  hone to 3.890 inches.  

There are several different makes and models of cylinder  hones. The burnishing hone is used only to produce the  desired finish on the cylinder wall. The more elaborate  

![](images/bc6e24deb104968c7cf257bfbab964c87c1efa2ac31621ae7f51927f92656c56.jpg)  
Figure 10-30.   Cylinder bore grinding.  

micromatic hone can also be used to straighten out the  cylinder walls. A burnishing hone should not be used in an  attempt to straighten cylinder walls.  [Figure 10-31]  Since  the stones are only spring loaded, they follow the contour  of the cylinder wall and may aggravate a tapered condition.  

Deglazing the cylinder walls is accomplished with the use  of a deglazing hone. A cross-hatch pattern must be placed  on the cylinder wall to allow for piston ring break-in. This  is accomplished by a deglazing hone turned by a drill being  moved in and out of the cylinder rapidly.  [Figure 10-32]  

After the cylinders have been reground or deglazed, or both,  check the size and wall finish, and check for evidence of  overheating or grinding cracks before installing on an engine.  

# Reassembly  

Before starting reassembly, all serviceable and new engine  components need to be cleaned, organized, and laid out in the  order they are to be assembled. A popular method of engine  assembly is for the engine to be assembled at one work station  with the same technicians completing the total assembly of  the engine. It is also important to refer to the parts catalog to  ensure that the correct hardware is used during the assembly  of the engine. The engine overhaul manual should be referred  to for information on the use of safety wire, self-locking  nuts, and torque values. During assembly, the components  should be pre-lubricated as the overhaul manual sets forth. It  is important to follow the manufacturer’s overhaul assembly  procedures completely and perform all checks and procedures  that are called for in the manual.  

![](images/a7b8de8f931b93abf8263de39437948a1ad8806651dc63127f2697b273149750.jpg)

# Installation & Testing  

# Testing Reciprocating Engines  

The procedures and equipment used in determining that  an engine is ready for airworthy service and is in excellent  mechanical condition, normally requires the use of a  test stand, or test cell, although the aircraft can be used.  

[Figure 10-33]  The method of engine testing or run-in that  takes place during overhaul prior to delivery of the engine  is critical to the airworthiness of the engine. It must be  emphasized that engine run-in is as vital as any other phase  of engine overhaul, for it is the means by which the quality  of a new or newly overhauled engine is checked, and it is  the final step in the preparation of an engine for service.  Thus, the reliability and potential service life of an engine  is in question until it has satisfactorily passed the cell test.  

The test serves a dual purpose. First, it accomplishes piston  ring run-in and bearing burnishing. Second, it provides  valuable information that it used to evaluate engine  performance and determine engine condition. To provide  proper oil flow to the upper portion of the cylinder barrel  walls with a minimum loss of oil, it is important that piston  rings be properly seated in the cylinder in which they are  installed. The process is called piston ring run-in (break- in) and is accomplished chiefly by controlled operation of  the engine in the high-speed range. Improper piston ring  conditioning, or run-in, may result in unsatisfactory engine  operation with high oil consumption. A process called bearing  burnishing creates a highly polished surface on new bearings  and bushings installed during overhaul. The burnishing is  usually accomplished during the first periods of the engine  run-in at comparatively slow engine speeds.  

The failure of any part during engine testing or run-in  requires that the engine be returned, repaired, and completely  retested. After an engine has successfully completed test  requirements, it is then specially treated to prevent corrosion,  if it is shipped or stored before being installed in an aircraft.  During the final run-in period during testing, the engines  are operated on the proper grade of fuel prescribed for the  particular kind of engine. The oil system is serviced with a  mixture of corrosion-preventive compound and engine oil.  The temperature of this mixture is maintained at   $105~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   to  

![](images/8d90750127e7a127bb28c05458b6e3887ee186598ee4a43b55719d3f708e7824.jpg)  
Figure 10-33.   Test stand.  

$121\ {}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . Near the end of final run-in, corrosion-preventive  mixture (CPM) is used as the engine lubricant. The engine  induction passages and combustion chambers are also  treated with CPM by an aspiration method. CPM is drawn  or breathed into the engine.  

# Test Cell Requirements  

The test cell requires an area to mount and hold the engine for  testing. The cell needs to have the controls, instruments, and  any special equipment to evaluate the total performance of the  engine. A test club should be used for testing instead of a flight  propeller.  [Figure 10-34]  A test club provides more cooling  air flow and the correct amount of load. The operational tests  and test procedures vary with individual engines, but the basic  requirements are generally closely related.  

# Engine Instruments  

The test cell control room contains the controls used to  operate the engine and the instruments used to measure  various temperatures and pressures, fuel flow, and other  factors. These devices are necessary in providing an accurate  check and an evaluation of the operating engine. The control  room is separate from, but adjacent to, the space (test cell)  that houses the engine being tested. The safe, economical, and  reliable testing of modern aircraft engines depends largely  upon the use of instruments. In engine run-in procedures, the  same basic engine instruments are used as when the engine  is installed in the aircraft, plus some additional connections  to these instruments, and some indicating and measuring  devices that cannot be practically installed in the aircraft.  Instruments used in the testing procedures are inspected  and calibrated periodically, as are instruments installed in  the aircraft; thus, accurate information concerning engine  operation is ensured.  

Engine instruments can operate using different methods,  some mechanically, some electrically, and some by sensing  

![](images/f6e6de3fb9b4b4a1d99cf77b0c50c94ecd0ca008659330bad5b8e91fdf0d1555.jpg)  

the direct pressure of air or liquid. Some of the basic  instruments are:  

1.	 Carburetor air temperature gauge.

 2.	 Fuel pressure gauge.

 3.	 Fuel-flow meter.

 4.	 Manifold pressure gauge.

 5.	 Oil temperature gauge.

 6.	 Oil pressure gauge.

 7.	 Tachometer.

 8.	 Exhaust gas temperature gauge.

 9.	 Cylinder head temperature gauge.

 10.	 Torquemeter.  

Instrument markings, ranges of operation, minimum and  maximum limits, and the interpretation of these markings  are general to all the instruments. Generally, the instrument  marking system consists of three colors: red, yellow, and  green. A red line, or mark, indicates a point beyond which  a dangerous operating condition exists. A red arc indicates  a dangerous operating range due generally to an engine  propeller vibration range. This arc can be passed through,  but the engine cannot be operated in this area. Of the two,  the red mark is used more commonly and is located radially  on the cover glass or dial face. The yellow arc covers a given  range of operation and is an indication of caution. Generally,  the yellow arc is located on the outer circumference of the  instrument cover glass or dial face. The green arc shows  a normal and safe range of operation. When the markings  appear on the cover glass, a white line is used as an index  mark, often called a slippage mark. The white radial mark  indicates any movement between the cover glass and the  case, a condition that would cause mislocation of the other  range and limit markings.  

# Carburetor Air Temperature (CAT) Indicator  

Measured at the carburetor entrance, carburetor air temperature  (CAT) is regarded by many as an indication of induction system  ice formation. Although it serves this purpose, it also provides  many other important items of information.  

The powerplant is a heat machine, and the temperature of  its components, or the fluids flowing through it, affects  the combustion process either directly or indirectly. The  temperature level of the induction air affects not only the  charge density, but also the vaporization of the fuel. CAT  is also useful for checking induction system condition.  Backfiring is indicated as a momentary rise on the gauge,  provided it is of sufficient severity for the heat to be sensed  at the carburetor air-measuring point. A sustained induction  system fire shows a continuous increase of CAT.  

The CAT should be noted before starting and just after  shutdown. The temperature before starting is the best  indication of the temperature of the fuel in the carburetor  body and tells whether vaporization is sufficient for the initial  firing, or whether the mixture must be augmented by priming.  If an engine has been shut down for only a short time, the  residual heat in the carburetor may make it possible to rely  on the vaporizing heat in the fuel and powerplant. Priming  would then be unnecessary.  

After shutdown, a high CAT is a warning that the fuel  trapped in the carburetor will expand, producing high internal  pressure. When a high temperature is present at this time,  the fuel line and manifold valves should be open so that the  pressure can be relieved by allowing fuel passage back to  the tank. The CAT gauge indicates the temperature of the air  before it enters the carburetor. The temperature reading is  sensed by a bulb or electric sensor. In the test cell, the sensor  is located in the air intake passage to the engine and, in an  aircraft, it is located in the ram-air intake duct. The CAT  gauge is calibrated in the centigrade scale.  [Figure 10-35] This gauge, like many other multi-engine aircraft instruments,  is a dual gauge; two gauges, each with a separate pointer and  scale, are used in the same case.  

Notice the range markings used. The yellow arc indicates a  range from  $-10\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   to  $+15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , since the danger of icing occurs  between these temperatures. The green range indicates the  normal operating range from  $+15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   to  $+40\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  . The red line  indicates the maximum operating temperature of   $40\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  ; any  operation at a temperature over this value places the engine  in danger of detonation.  

# Fuel Pressure Indicator  

The fuel pressure gauge is calibrated in pounds per square  inch (psi) of pressure. It is used during the test run-in to  measure engine fuel pressure at the carburetor inlet, the fuel  

![](images/bb973e620409381b655bc486f209f3991ccb82f99d4019c68f6adb7172385fb9.jpg)  
Figure 10-35.   Carburetor air temperature gauge.  

feed valve discharge nozzle, and the main fuel supply line.  Fuel gauges are located in the operator’s control room and  are connected by flexible lines to the different points at which  pressure readings are desired during the testing procedures.  

In some aircraft installations, the fuel pressure is sensed at the  carburetor or fuel injection unit inlet of each engine, and the  pressure is indicated on individual gauges on the instrument  panel.  [Figure 10-36]  The dial is calibrated in graduations  and is extended and numbered. The numbers range from  0 to 10 in this example. The red line on the dial at the 2  pounds psi graduation shows the minimum fuel pressure  allowed during flight. The green arc shows the desired range  of operation, which is 2 to 9 psi. The red line at the 9 psi  graduation indicates the maximum allowable fuel pressure.  Fuel pressures vary with the type of fuel system installation  and the size of the engine. When fuel injection systems are  used, the fuel pressure range is much higher; the minimum  allowable pressure is approximately  $10\,\mathrm{psi}$  , and the maximum  is generally 25 psi.  

# Oil Pressure Indicator  

The main oil pressure reading is taken at the pressure side of  the oil pump. Generally, there is only one oil pressure gauge  for each aircraft engine. The oil pressure gauge dial does  not show the pressure range or limits for all installations.  [Figure 10-36]  The actual markings for specific aircraft may  be found in the aircraft specifications or Type Certificate Data  Sheets. The lower red line at 25 psi indicates the minimum oil  pressure permissible in flight. The green arc between 60 to 85  psi illustrates the desired operating oil pressure range. The red  line at 100 psi indicates maximum permissible oil pressure.  

![](images/52e43c445989ef2a5870ecd0aa1aeedad8a9550fb303fc568bfbad1c17102838.jpg)  
Figure 10-36.   Engine instrument clusters.  

The oil pressure gauge indicates the pressure, in psi, that  the oil of the lubricating system is being supplied to the  moving parts of the engine. The engine should be shut down  immediately if the gauge fails to register pressure when the  engine is operating. Excessive oscillation of the gauge pointer  indicates that there is air in the lines leading to the gauge, or  that some unit of the oil system is functioning improperly.  

# Oil Temperature Indicator  

During engine run-in in the test cell, engine oil temperature  readings are taken at the oil inlet and outlet. From these  readings, it can be determined if the engine heat transferred  to the oil is low, normal, or excessive. This information is of  extreme importance during the breaking-in process of large  reciprocating engines. The oil temperature gauge line in the  aircraft is connected at the oil inlet to the engine.  

Three range markings are used on the oil temperature  gauge. The green arc in  Figure 10-36 , on the dial, shows the  minimum oil temperature permissible for ground operational  checks or during flight. The green mark between   $25\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  and below   $245\ \mathrm{~^{\circ}F~}$   shows the desired oil temperature for  continuous engine operation. The red mark at  $245\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   indicates  the maximum permissible oil temperature.  

# Fuel-Flow Meter  

The fuel-flow meter measures the amount of fuel delivered to  the engine. During engine testing procedures, the fuel-flow  to the engine can be measured by three different methods: a  direct flow meter, a pressure-based flow meter, or a turbine  sensor-based flow meter. The direct reading flow meter uses  a series of calibrated tubes located in the control room. The  tubes are of various sizes to indicate different volumes of  fuel-flow. Each tube contains a float that can be seen by the  operator, and as the fuel-flow through the tube varies, the  float is either raised or lowered, indicating the amount of  fuel-flow. From these indications, the operator can determine  whether an engine is operating at the correct air-fuel mixture  for a given power setting. Reciprocating engines on light  aircraft usually use a fuel pressure gauge that is also used for  the flow meter. This is because the fuel-flow is proportional  to the fuel pressure in this system. Fuel-flow is normally  measured in gallons per hour.  

In most turbine aircraft installations, the fuel-flow indicating  system consists of a transmitter and an indicator for each  engine. The fuel-flow transmitter is conveniently mounted  in the engine’s accessory section and measures the fuel-flow  between the engine-driven fuel pump and the fuel control  device. The transmitter is an electrical device that contains a  turbine that turns faster as the flow increases, which increases  the electrical signal to the indicator. The fuel-flow transmitter  is connected electrically to the indicator located on the aircraft  flight deck, or on the test cell operator’s panel. The reading  on the indicator on turbine aircraft is calibrated to record the  amount of fuel-flow in pounds of fuel per hour.  

# Manifold Pressure Indicator  

The preferred type of instrument for measuring the manifold  pressure on reciprocating engines is a gauge that records the  pressure as an absolute pressure reading. Absolute pressure  takes into account the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure  in the intake manifold. To read the manifold pressure of the  engines, a specially designed manifold pressure gauge that  indicates absolute manifold pressure in inches of mercury   $(^{\ast}\mathrm{Hg})$   is used. The red line indicates the maximum manifold  pressure permissible during takeoff.  

The manifold pressure gauge range markings and indications  vary with different kinds of engines and installations.  Figure 10-37  illustrates the dial of a typical manifold pressure  gauge and shows how the range markings are positioned.  The green arc starts at   $35~"\mathrm{Hg}$   and continues to the  $44\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  .  The red line on the gauge, at   $49\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   shows the manifold  pressure recommended for takeoff. This pressure should  not be exceeded.  

# Tachometer Indicator  

The tachometer for reciprocating engines shows the engine  crankshaft rpm. The system used for testing the engine is the  same as the system in the aircraft installation. The tachometer,  often referred to as TACH, is calibrated in hundreds with  graduations at every 100-rpm interval. The dial shown in  Figure 10-38  starts at   $0\ \mathrm{rpm}$   and goes to 35   $(3{,}500~\mathrm{rpm})$  .  The green arc indicates the rpm range within operation that  is permissible. The red line indicates the maximum rpm  permissible during takeoff; any rpm beyond this value is an  overspeed condition.  

Turbine engines use percent rpm indicators due to the  high rpm that the engines generally operate. Each rotating  assembly in an engine has its own percent rpm indicator.  The tachometer indicates speed of the compressor section.  The 100 percent position on the indicator is the highest rpm  at which the engine can operate. Red lines and green arcs  operate the same as with reciprocating engines. Rotorcraft  use two synchronous tachometers.  

# Cylinder Head Temperature Indicator  

During the engine test procedures, the cylinder head  temperatures of various cylinders on the reciprocating  engine are normally tested. Thermocouples are connected  to several cylinders and, by a selector switch, any cylinder  head temperature can be indicated on the indicators.  When installed in the aircraft, there is sometimes only one  

![](images/47254e3dd0417ea0d2f24d58ef8d906fc7223529f1b0beea55dae69a5adb19d0.jpg)

Figure 10-38.   Tachometer.  

thermocouple lead and indicator for each engine installed  in an aircraft.  

Cylinder head temperatures are indicated by a gauge  connected to a thermocouple attached to the cylinder, that  tests show to be the hottest on an engine in a particular  installation. The thermocouple may be placed in a special  gasket located under a rear spark plug, or in a special well  in the top or rear of the cylinder head.  

The temperature recorded at either of these points is merely  a reference or control temperature; but as long as it is  kept within the prescribed limits, the temperatures inside  the cylinder dome, exhaust valve, and piston is within a  satisfactory range. Since the thermocouple is attached to only  one cylinder, it can do no more than give evidence of general  engine temperature. While normally it can be assumed that  the remaining cylinder temperatures are lower, conditions  such as detonation are not indicated unless they occur in the  cylinder that has the thermocouple attached.  

The cylinder head temperature gauge range marking is  similar to that of the manifold pressure and tachometer  indicator. The cylinder head temperature gauge is a dual  gauge that incorporates two separate temperature scales.  [Figure 10-39]  The scales are calibrated in increments of  $10^{\circ}$  ,  with numerals at the  $0^{\circ}$  ,   $100^{\circ}$  ,  $200^{\circ}$  , and  $300^{\circ}$   graduations. The  space between any two graduation marks represents   $10~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  The blue arc on the gauge indicates the range within which  operation is permitted in auto-lean. The bottom of this arc,   $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , indicates the minimum desired temperature to ensure  efficient engine operation during flight. The top of the blue  arc,   $230~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  , indicates the temperature at which the mixture  control must be moved to the “auto-rich” position. The green  arc describes the range within which operation must be in  auto-rich. The top of this arc,   $248\ ^{\circ}\mathbf{C},$  , indicates maximum  continuous power; all operation above this temperature is  limited in time (usually 5 to 15 minutes). The red line indicates  maximum permissible temperature,  $260\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  .  

# Torquemeter  

Most torque systems use an oil pressure output from a torque  valve to indicate actual engine power output at various power  settings. The torquemeter indicates the amount of torque being  produced at the propeller shaft. A helical gear moves back and  forth as the torque on the propeller shaft varies. This gear,  acting on a piston, positions a valve that meters the oil pressure  proportionally to the torque being produced. A change in  pressure from the valve that is connected to a transducer is  then converted to an electrical signal and is transmitted to  the flight deck. The torquemeter can read out in foot-pounds  

![](images/9a1b22a7c924ae882deb8e519020a2b259b8244cef6cc18b2f6d59b0afd9da52.jpg)

of torque, percent of horsepower, or horsepower. The earlier  systems read out in psi, and the flight engineer converted this  to the correct power setting.  [Figure 10-40]  Some systems use  strain gauges to attach to the ring gear to provide an electrical  signal directly to the readout.  

# Warning Systems  

Many of the miscellaneous gauges and devices indicate only  that a system is functioning or has failed to function. On some  aircraft, a warning light illuminates when the fuel pressure  or oil pressure is low.  

# Reciprocating Engine Operation  

The operation of the powerplant is controlled from the  flight deck. Some installations have numerous control  handles and levers connected to the engine by rods, cables,  bellcranks, pulleys, etc. In most cases, the control handles  are conveniently mounted on quadrants in the flight deck.  Placards, or markings, are placed on the quadrant to indicate  the functions and positions of the levers. In some installations,  friction clutches are installed to hold the controls in place.  

# Engine Instruments  

The term engine instruments usually includes all instruments  required to measure and indicate the functioning of the  powerplant. The engine instruments are generally installed on  the instrument panel so that all of them can easily be observed  at one time. Manifold pressure, rpm, engine temperature, oil  temperature, CAT, and the air-fuel ratio can be controlled  by manipulating the flight deck controls. Coordinating the  movement of the controls with the instrument readings  protects against exceeding operating limits.  

Engine operation is usually limited by specified operating  ranges of the following:  

1.	 Crankshaft speed (rpm). 2.	 Manifold pressure.

The procedures, pressures, temperatures, and rpm used  throughout this section are solely for the purpose of  illustration and do not have general application. The operating  procedures and limits used on individual makes and models  of aircraft engines vary considerably from the values shown  here. For exact information regarding a specific engine  model, consult the applicable instructions.  

# Engine Starting  

Before starting the engine, observe the manifold pressure  gauge that should read approximate atmospheric (barometric)  pressure when the engine is not running. At sea level, this  is approximately   $30~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , and at fields above sea level, the  atmospheric pressure is less, depending on the height above  sea level. Also, observe all engine gauges for the correct  reading for engine off settings.  

Correct starting technique is an important part of engine  operation. Improper procedures often are used, because  some of the basic principles involved in engine operation  are misunderstood. Read more about typical procedures for  starting reciprocating engines in the Aviation Maintenance  Technician Handbook - General.  

# Pre-Oiling  

Engines that have undergone overhaul or major maintenance  can have air trapped in some of the oil passages that must  be removed before the first start. This is done by pre-oiling  the engine by cranking, with the spark plugs removed, the  engine with the starter or by hand (turning) until oil pressure  is indicated. A second method is to pump oil under pressure  through the oil system using an external pump until oil comes  out of the oil outlet of the engine.  

# Hydraulic Lock  

Whenever a radial engine remains shut down for any  length of time beyond a few minutes, oil or fuel may drain  into the combustion chambers of the lower cylinders or  accumulate in the lower intake pipes ready to be drawn into  the cylinders when the engine starts.  [Figure 10-41]  As the  piston approaches top center of the compression stroke (both  valves closed), this liquid being incompressible, stops piston  movement. If the crankshaft continues to rotate, something

must give. Therefore, starting or attempting to start an engine  with a hydraulic lock of this nature may cause the affected  cylinder to blow out or, more likely, may result in a bent or  broken connecting rod.  

To eliminate a lock, remove either the front or rear spark plug  of the lower cylinders and pull the propeller through in the  direction of rotation. The piston expels any liquid that may  be present. If the hydraulic lock occurs as a result of over- priming prior to initial engine start, eliminate the lock in the  same manner (i.e., remove one of the spark plugs from the  cylinder and rotate the crankshaft through two turns). Never  attempt to clear the hydraulic lock by pulling the propeller  through in the direction opposite to normal rotation. This  tends to inject the liquid from the cylinder into the intake pipe  with the possibility of a complete or partial lock occurring  on the subsequent start.  

# Engine Warm-Up  

Proper engine warm-up is important, particularly when the  condition of the engine is unknown. Improperly adjusted idle  mixture, intermittently firing spark plugs, and improperly  adjusted engine valves all have an overlapping effect on  engine stability. Therefore, the warm-up should be made at  the engine speed where maximum engine stability is obtained.  Experience has shown that the optimum warm-up speed is  from 1,000 to  $1{,}600\,\mathrm{rpm}$  . The actual speed selected should be  the speed at which engine operation is the smoothest, since  the smoothest operation is an indication that all phases of  engine operation are the most stable.  

Some engines incorporate temperature-compensated oil  pressure relief valves. This type of relief valve results in high  engine oil pressures immediately after the engine starts, if  oil temperatures are very low. Consequently, start the warm- up of these engines at approximately   $1{,}000~\mathrm{rpm}$   and then  move to the higher, more stable engine speed as soon as oil  temperature reaches a warmer level.  

During warm-up, watch the instruments associated with  engine operation. This aids in making sure that all phases  of engine operation are normal. For example, engine oil  pressure should be indicated within 30 seconds after the start.  Furthermore, if the oil pressure is not up to or above normal  within 1 minute after the engine starts, the engine should be  shut down. Cylinder head or coolant temperatures should  be observed continually to see that they do not exceed the  maximum allowable limit.  

A lean mixture should not be used to hasten the warm-up.  Actually, at the warm-up rpm, there is very little difference  in the mixture supplied to the engine, whether the mixture is  in a rich or lean position, since metering in this power range  is governed by throttle position.  

Carburetor heat can be used as required under conditions  leading to ice formation. For engines equipped with a float-type  carburetor, it is desirable to raise the CAT during warm-up to  prevent ice formation and to ensure smooth operation.  

The magneto safety check can be performed during warm- up. Its purpose is to ensure that all ignition connections are  secure, and that the ignition system permits operation at the  higher power settings used during later phases of the ground  check. The time required for proper warm-up gives ample  opportunity to perform this simple check, which may disclose  a condition that would make it inadvisable to continue  operation until after corrections have been made.  

The magneto safety check is conducted with the propeller  in the high rpm (low pitch) position, at approximately 1,000  rpm. Move the ignition switch from “both” to “right” and  return to “both;” from “both” to “left” and return to “both;”  from “both” to “off” momentarily and return to “both.”  

While switching from “both” to a single magneto position, a  slight but noticeable drop in rpm should occur. This indicates  that the opposite magneto has been properly grounded out.  Complete cutting out of the engine when switching from  “both” to “off” indicates that both magnetos are grounded  properly. While in the single magneto position, failure to  obtain any rpm drop, or failure of the engine to cut out while  switching to off, indicates that one or both ground connections  are faulty. This indicates a safety problem; the magnetos are  not secured at shut down and may fire if the propeller is turned.  

# Ground Check  

The ground check is performed to evaluate the functioning  of the engine by comparing power input, as measured by  manifold pressure, with power output, as measured by rpm  or torque.  

The engine may be capable of producing a prescribed power,  even rated takeoff, and not be functioning properly. Only by  comparing the manifold pressure required during the check  against a known standard is an unsuitable condition disclosed.  The magneto check can also fail to show shortcomings, since  the allowable rpm dropoff is only a measure of an improperly  functioning ignition system and is not necessarily affected  by other factors. Conversely, it is possible for the magneto  check to prove satisfactory when an unsatisfactory condition  is present elsewhere in the engine.  

The ground check is made after the engine is thoroughly  warm. It consists of checking the operation of the powerplant  and accessory equipment by ear, by visual inspection, and  by proper interpretation of instrument readings, control  movements, and switch reactions. During the ground check,  the aircraft should be headed into the wind, if possible, to take  advantage of the cooling airflow. A ground check procedure  is outlined below:  

1.	 Control position check. 2.	 Cowl flaps (if equipped)—open. 3.	 Mixture—rich. 4.	 Propeller—high rpm. 5.	 Carburetor heat—cold. 6.	 Check propeller according to propeller manufacturer’s  instruction. 7.	 Open throttle to the run-up rpm setting as per  manufacturer’s instructions (specified RPM and  manifold pressure). 8.	 Ignition system operational check.  

In performing the ignition system operational check (magneto  check), the power-absorbing characteristics of the propeller  in the low fixed-pitch position are utilized. In switching to  individual magnetos, cutting out the opposite plugs results  in a slower rate of combustion, which gives the same effect  as retarding the spark advance. The drop in engine speed is  a measure of the power loss at this slower combustion rate.  

When the magneto check is performed, a drop in torquemeter  pressure indication is a good supplement to the variation  in rpm. In cases where the tachometer scale is graduated  coarsely, the torquemeter variation may give more positive  evidence of the power change when switching to the  individual magneto condition. A loss in torquemeter pressure  not to exceed 10 percent can be expected when operating on  a single magneto. By comparing the rpm drop with a known  standard, the following are determined:  

1.	 Proper timing of each magneto. 2.	 General engine performance as evidenced by smooth  operation. 3.	 Additional check of the proper connection of the  ignition leads.  

Any unusual roughness on either magneto is an indication of  faulty ignition caused by plug fouling or by malfunctioning  of the ignition system. The operator should be very sensitive  to engine roughness during this check. Lack of dropoff in  rpm may be an indication of faulty grounding of one side of  the ignition system. Complete cutting out when switching to  one magneto is definite evidence that its side of the ignition  system is not functioning. Excessive difference in rpm drop  off between the left and right switch positions can indicate  a difference in time between the left and right magnetos.  

Sufficient time should be given to the check on each single  switch position to permit complete stabilization of engine  speed and manifold pressure. There is a tendency to perform  this check too rapidly with resultant wrong indications.  Operation as long as 1 minute on a single ignition system  is not excessive.  

Another point that must be emphasized is the danger of  sticking tachometer. The tachometer should he tapped lightly  to make sure the indicator needle moves freely. In some cases  using older mechanical tachometers, sticking has caused  errors in indication to the extent of   $100~\mathrm{rpm}$  . Under such  conditions, the ignition system could have had as much as  a   $200\;\mathrm{rpm}$   drop with only a   $100\;\mathrm{rpm}$   drop indicated on the  instrument. In most cases, tapping the instrument eliminates  the sticking and results in accurate readings.  

In recording the results of time ignition system check,  record the amount of the total rpm drop that occurs rapidly  and the amount that occurs slowly. This breakdown in rpm  drop provides a means of pinpointing certain troubles in  the ignition system. This can reduce unnecessary work by  confining maintenance to the specific part of the ignition  system that is responsible for the trouble.  

Fast rpm drop is usually the result of either faulty spark  plugs or faulty ignition harness. This is true because faulty  plugs or leads, take effect at once. The cylinder goes dead  or starts firing intermittently the instant the switch is moved  from “both” to the “right” or “left” position.  

Slow rpm drop usually is caused by incorrect ignition timing  or faulty valve adjustment. With late ignition timing, the  charge is fired too late (in relation to piston travel) for the  combustion pressures to build up to the maximum at the  proper time. The result is a power loss greater than normal for  single ignition because of the lower peak pressures obtained  in the cylinder. However, this power loss does not occur as  rapidly as that which accompanies a dead spark plug. This  explains the slow rpm drop as compared to the instantaneous  drop with a dead plug or defective lead. Incorrect valve  clearances, through their effect on valve overlap, can cause  the mixture to be too rich or too lean. The too rich or too lean  mixture may affect one plug more than another, because of the  plug location and show up as a slow rpm drop on the ignition  check. Switch from “both” to “right” and return to “both.”  Switch from “both” to “left” and return to “both.” Observe  the rpm drop while operating on the right and left positions.  The maximum drop should not exceed that specified by the  engine manufacturer.  

# Fuel Pressure & Oil Pressure Check  

Fuel pressure and oil pressure must be within the established  tolerance (green arc) for the engine.  

# Propeller Pitch Check  

The propeller is checked to ensure proper operation of the  pitch control and the pitch-change mechanism. The operation  of a controllable pitch propeller is checked by the indications  of the tachometer and manifold pressure gauge when the  propeller governor control is moved from one position to  another. Because each type of propeller requires a different  procedure, the applicable manufacturer’s instructions should  be followed.  

# Power Check  

Specific rpm and manifold pressure relationship should be  checked during each ground check. This can be done at the  time the engine is run-up to make the magneto check. The  purpose of this check is to measure the performance of the  engine against an established standard. Calibration tests have  determined that the engine is capable of delivering a given  power at a given rpm and manifold pressure. The original  calibration, or measurement of power, is made by means of a  dynamometer in a test cell. During the ground check, power  is measured with the propeller. With constant conditions of  air density, the propeller, at any fixed-pitch position, always  requires the same rpm to absorb the same horsepower from  the engine. This characteristic is used in determining the  condition of the engine.  

With the governor control set for full low pitch, the propeller  operates as a fixed-pitch propeller, because the engine is  static. Under these conditions, the manifold pressure for any  specific engine, with the mixture control in rich, indicates  whether all the cylinders are operating properly. With one  or more dead or intermittently firing cylinders, the operating  cylinders must provide more power for a given rpm.  Consequently, the carburetor throttle must be opened further,  resulting in higher manifold pressure. Different engines of  the same model using the same propeller installation, and at  the same barometer and temperature readings, should require  the same manifold pressure to within  $1\ "\mathrm{Hg}$  . A higher than  normal manifold pressure usually indicates a dead cylinder  or late ignition timing. An excessively low manifold pressure  for a particular rpm usually indicates that the ignition timing  is early. Early ignition can cause detonation and loss of power  at takeoff power settings.  

The accuracy of the power check may be affected by the  following variables:  

1.	 Wind—any appreciable air movement (5 mph or more)  changes the air load on the propeller blade when it is  in the fixed-pitch position. A head wind increases the  rpm obtainable with a given manifold pressure. A tail  wind decreases the rpm. 2.	 Atmospheric temperatures—the effects of variations  in atmospheric temperature tend to cancel each other.  Higher carburetor intake and cylinder temperatures  tend to lower the rpm, but the propeller load is  lightened because of the less dense air. 3.	 Engine and induction system temperature—if the  cylinder and carburetor temperatures are high because  of factors other than atmospheric temperature, a low  rpm results since the power is lowered without a  compensating lowering of the propeller load. 4.	 Oil temperature—cold oil tends to hold down the rpm,  since the higher viscosity results in increased friction  horsepower losses.  

# Idle Speed & Idle Mixture Checks  

Plug fouling difficulty is the inevitable result of failure to  provide a proper idle mixture setting. The tendency seems  to be to adjust the idle mixture on the extremely rich side  and to compensate for this by adjusting the throttle stop to  a relatively high rpm for minimum idling. With a properly  adjusted idle mixture setting, it is possible to run the engine at  idle rpm for long periods. Such a setting results in a minimum  of plug fouling and exhaust smoking, and it pays dividends  from the savings on the aircraft brakes after landing and  while taxiing.  

If the wind is not too strong, the idle mixture setting can be  checked easily during the ground check as follows:  

1.	 Close throttle. 2.	 Move the mixture control to the idle cutoff position  and observe the change in rpm. Return the mixture  control back to the rich position before engine cutoff.  

As the mixture control lever is moved into idle cutoff,  and before normal dropoff, one of two things may occur  momentarily:  

1.	 The engine speed may increase. An increase in rpm,  but less than that recommended by the manufacturer  (usually  $20\,\mathrm{rpm})$  ), indicates proper mixture strength. A  greater increase indicates that the mixture is too rich. 2.	 The engine speed may not increase or may drop  immediately. This indicates that the idle mixture is too  lean. The idle mixture should be set to give a mixture  slightly richer than best power, resulting in a 10- to  20-rpm rise after idle cutoff.  

# Engine Stopping  

With each type of engine installation, specific procedures are  used in stopping the engine. The general procedure, outlined  in the following paragraphs, reduces the time required for  stopping, minimizes backfiring tendencies, and prevents  overheating of tightly baffled air-cooled engine during  operation on the ground.  

In stopping any aircraft engine, the controls are set as follows,  irrespective of the type or fuel system installation.  

1.	 Cowl flaps and any other shutters or doors are always  placed in the full open position to avoid overheating  the engine and are left in that position after the engine  is stopped to prevent engine residual heat from  deteriorating the ignition system. 2.	 Carburetor air-heater control is left in the cold position  to prevent damage that may occur from backfire. 3. 	 Constant speed propeller is usually stopped with the  control set in the high pitch (decrease rpm) position to  prevent exposure and corrosion of the pitch changing  mechanism.  

No mention is made of the throttle, mixture control, fuel  selector valve, and ignition switches in the preceding set  of directions because the operation of these controls varies  with the type of carburetor used with the engine. An engine  equipped with a carburetor incorporating an idle cutoff  mixture control is stopped as follows:  

1.	 Idle the engine by setting the throttle for 800 to 1,000  rpm.  

2.	 Move the mixture control to the idle cutoff position.  In a float-type carburetor, it equalizes the pressure in  the float chamber and at the discharge nozzle. 3.	 After the propeller has stopped rotating, place the  ignition switch in the off position.  

In addition to the operations outlined previously, check the  functioning of various items of aircraft equipment, such as  generator systems, hydraulic systems, etc.  

# Basic Engine Operating Principles  

# Combustion Process  

Normal combustion occurs when the air-fuel mixture ignites  in the cylinder and burns progressively at a fairly uniform rate  across the combustion chamber. When ignition is properly  timed, maximum pressure is built up just after the piston has  passed top dead center at the end of the compression stroke.  

The flame fronts start at each spark plug and burn in more  or less wavelike forms.  [Figure 10-42]  The velocity of the  flame travel is influenced by the type of fuel, the ratio of the  air-fuel mixture, and the pressure and temperature of the fuel  mixture. With normal combustion, the flame travel is about  100 feet/second. The temperature and pressure within the  cylinder rises at a normal rate as the air-fuel mixture burns.  

# Detonation  

There is a limit, however, to the amount of compression and  the degree of temperature rise that can be tolerated within an  engine cylinder and still permit normal combustion. All fuels  

![](images/51371480e74ad4e785894940ef24772f96291160c5a2d0369928f9a4b34c6e05.jpg)  
Figure 10-42.   Normal combustion within a cylinder.  

have critical limits of temperature and compression. Beyond  this limit, they ignite spontaneously and burn with explosive  violence. This instantaneous and explosive burning of the  air-fuel mixture or, more accurately, of the latter portion of  the charge is called detonation.  

Detonation is the spontaneous combustion of the unburned  charge ahead of the flame fronts after ignition of the charge.  [Figure 10-43]  During normal combustion, the flame fronts  progress from the point of ignition across the cylinder. These  flame fronts compress the gases ahead of them. At the same  time, the gases are being compressed by the upward movement  of the piston. If the total compression on the remaining  unburned gases exceeds the critical point, detonation occurs.  

The explosive burning during detonation results in an  extremely rapid pressure rise. This rapid pressure rise and  the high instantaneous temperature, combined with the  high turbulence generated, cause a scrubbing action on the  cylinder and the piston. This can burn a hole completely  through the piston.  

The critical point of detonation varies with the ratio of fuel to  air in the mixture. Therefore, the detonation characteristic of  the mixture can be controlled by varying the air-fuel ratio. At  high power output, combustion pressures and temperatures  are higher than they are at low or medium power. Therefore,  at high power, the air-fuel ratio is made richer than is needed  for good combustion at medium or low power output. This  is done because, in general, a rich mixture does not detonate  as readily as a lean mixture.  

![](images/78e07a3a9be3b4c6eb275dfb2eccb42e817732662da68f54bc5f84d4033cf4c0.jpg)  
Figure 10-43.   Detonation within a cylinder.  

Unless detonation is heavy, there is no flight deck evidence  of its presence. Light to medium detonation does not cause  noticeable roughness, temperature increase, or loss of power.  As a result, it can be present during takeoff and high-power  climb without being known to the flight crew.  

In fact, the effects of detonation are often not discovered until  after teardown of the engine. When the engine is overhauled,  however, the presence of severe detonation during its  operation is indicated by dished piston heads, collapsed  valve heads, broken ring lands, or eroded portions of valves,  pistons, or cylinder heads.  

The basic protection from detonation is provided in the design  of the engine carburetor setting, which automatically supplies  the rich mixtures required for detonation suppression at high  power; the rating limitations, which include the maximum  operating temperatures; and selection of the correct grade of  fuel. The design factors, cylinder cooling, magneto timing,  mixture distribution, degree of supercharging, and carburetor  setting are taken care of in the design and development of the  engine and its method of installation in the aircraft.  

The remaining responsibility for prevention of detonation  rests squarely in the hands of the ground and flight crews.  They are responsible for observance of rpm and manifold  pressure limits. Proper use of supercharger and fuel mixture,  and maintenance of suitable cylinder head and carburetor- air-temperature (CAT) must be adhered to.  

# Pre-Ignition  

Pre-ignition, as the name implies, means that combustion  takes place within the cylinder before the timed spark jumps  across the spark plug terminals. This condition can often be  traced to excessive carbon or other deposits that cause local  hot spots. Detonation often leads to pre-ignition. However,  pre-ignition may also be caused by high-power operation on  excessively lean mixtures. Pre-ignition is usually indicated  in the flight deck by engine roughness, backfiring, and by a  sudden increase in cylinder head temperature.  

Any area within the combustion chamber that becomes  incandescent serves as an igniter in advance of normal timed  ignition and causes combustion earlier than desired. Pre- ignition may be caused by an area roughened and heated by  detonation erosion. A cracked valve or piston, or a broken  spark plug insulator, may furnish a hot point, that serves as  a glow plug.  

The hot spot can be caused by deposits on the chamber  surfaces resulting from the use of leaded fuels. Normal  carbon deposits can also cause pre-ignition. Specifically, pre- ignition is a condition similar to early timing of the spark. The  charge in the cylinder is ignited before the required time for  normal engine firing. However, do not confuse pre-ignition  with the spark that occurs too early in the cycle. Pre-ignition  is caused by a hot spot in the combustion chamber, not by  incorrect ignition timing. The hot spot may be due to either  an overheated cylinder or a defect within the cylinder.  

The most obvious method of correcting pre-ignition is to  reduce the cylinder temperature. The immediate step is to  retard the throttle. This reduces the amount of fuel charge  and the amount of heat generated. If a supercharger is in use,  reduce manifold pressure as much as possible to reduce the  charge temperature. Following this, the mixture should be  enriched, if possible, to lower combustion temperature. If the  engine is at high power when pre-ignition occurs, retarding  the throttle for a few seconds may provide enough cooling  to chip off some of the lead, or other deposit, within the  combustion chamber. These chipped-off particles pass out  through the exhaust.  

# Backfiring  

When an air-fuel mixture does not contain enough fuel  to consume all the oxygen, it is called a lean mixture.  Conversely, a charge that contains more fuel than required  is called a rich mixture. An extremely lean mixture either  does not burn at all or burns so slowly that combustion is  not complete at the end of the exhaust stroke. The flame  lingers in the cylinder and then ignites the contents in the  intake manifold or the induction system when the intake  valve opens. This causes an explosion known as backfiring,  which can damage the carburetor and other parts of the  induction system.  

Incorrect ignition timing, or faulty ignition wires, can cause  the cylinder to fire at the wrong time, allowing the cylinder  to fire when the intake valve is open, which can cause  backfiring. A point worth stressing is that backfiring rarely  involves the whole engine. Therefore, it is seldom the fault of  the carburetor. In practically all cases, backfiring is limited to  one or two cylinders. Usually, it is the result of faulty valve  clearance setting, defective fuel injector nozzles, or other  conditions that cause these cylinders to operate leaner than  the engine as a whole. There can be no permanent cure until  these defects are discovered and corrected. Because these  backfiring cylinders fire intermittently and, therefore, run  cool, they can be detected by the cold cylinder check. The  cold cylinder check is discussed later in this chapter.  

In some instances, an engine backfires in the idle range but  operates satisfactorily at medium and high power settings.  The most likely cause, in this case, is an excessively lean  idle mixture. Proper adjustment of the idle air-fuel mixture  usually corrects this problem.  

# Afterfiring  

Afterfiring, sometimes called afterburning, often results  when the air-fuel mixture is too rich. Overly rich mixtures  are also slow burning; therefore, charges of unburned fuel are  present in the exhausted gases. Air from outside the exhaust  stacks mixes with this unburned fuel that ignites. This causes  an explosion in the exhaust system. Afterfiring is perhaps  more common where long exhaust ducting retains greater  amounts of unburned charges. As in the case of backfiring,  the correction for afterfiring is the proper adjustment of the  air-fuel mixture.  

Afterfiring can also be caused by cylinders that are not  firing because of faulty spark plugs, defective fuel-injection  nozzles. or incorrect valve clearance. The unburned mixture  from these dead cylinders passes into the exhaust system,  where it ignites and burns. Unfortunately, the resultant  torching or afterburning can easily be mistaken for evidence  of a rich carburetor. Cylinders that are firing intermittently  can cause a similar effect. Again, the malfunction can be  remedied only by discovering the real cause and correcting  the defect. Dead or intermittent cylinders can be located by  the cold cylinder check.  

# Factors Affecting Engine Operation  

# Compression  

To prevent loss of power, all openings to the cylinder must  close and seal completely on the compression and power  strokes. In this respect, there are three items in the proper  operation of the cylinder that must be operating correctly for  maximum efficiency. First, the piston rings must be in good  condition to provide maximum sealing during the stroke of  the piston. There must be no leakage between the piston and  the walls of the combustion chamber. Second, the intake and  exhaust valves must close tightly so that there is no loss of  compression at these points. Third, and very important, the  timing of the valves (opening and closing) must be such that  highest efficiency is obtained when the engine is operating at  its normal rated rpm. A failure at any of these points results  in greatly reduced engine efficiency.  

# Fuel Metering  

The induction system is the distribution and fuel-metering  part of the engine. Obviously, any defect in the induction  system seriously affects engine operation. For best operation,  each cylinder of the engine must be provided with the proper  air-fuel mixture, usually metered by the carburetor. On some  fuel-injection engines, fuel is metered by the fuel injector  flow divider and fuel-injection nozzles.  

The relation between air-fuel ratio and power is illustrated  in  Figure 10-44 . As the fuel mixture is varied from lean to  rich, the power output of the engine increases until it reaches  a maximum. Beyond this point, the power output falls off  as the mixture is further enriched. This is because the fuel  mixture is now too rich to provide perfect combustion. Note  that maximum engine power can be obtained by setting the  carburetor for one point on the curve.  

In establishing the carburetor settings for an aircraft engine,  the design engineers run a series of curves similar to the one  shown. A curve is run for each of several engine speeds. If,  for example, the idle speed is  $600\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , the first curve might  be run at this speed. Another curve might be run at  $700\,\mathrm{rpm},$  ,  another at  $800\,\mathrm{rpm}$  , and so on, in 100-rpm increments, up to  takeoff rpm. The points of maximum power on the curves are  then joined to obtain the best power curve of the engine for  all speeds. This best power curve establishes the rich setting  of the carburetor.  

In establishing the detailed engine requirements regarding  carburetor setting, the fact that the cylinder head temperature  varies with air-fuel ratio must be considered. This variation is  illustrated in the curve shown in  Figure 10-45 . Note that the  cylinder head temperature is lower with the auto-lean setting  than it is with the auto-rich mixture. This is exactly opposite  common belief, but it is true. Furthermore, knowledge  of this fact can be used to advantage by flight crews. If,  during cruise, it becomes difficult to keep the cylinder head  temperature within limits, the air-fuel mixture may be leaned  out to get cooler operation. The desired cooling can then be  obtained without going to auto-rich with its costly waste of  fuel. The curve shows only the variation in cylinder head  temperature. For a given rpm, the power output of the engine  is less with the best-economy setting (auto-lean) than with  the best-power mixture.  

The decrease in cylinder head temperature with a leaner  mixture holds true only through the normal cruise range.  At higher power settings, cylinder temperatures are higher  

![](images/10d592a5b3410bb5821e9b83c27d889add209531ca72e45bc2f8e94b2dae859d.jpg)

Figure 10-45.   Variation in head temperature with air-fuel mixture  (cruise power).  

with the leaner mixtures. The reason for this reversal hinges  on the cooling ability of the engine. As higher powers are  approached, a point is reached where the airflow around the  cylinders do not provide sufficient cooling. At this point, a  secondary cooling method must be used. This secondary  cooling is done by enriching the air-fuel mixture beyond  the best-power point. Although enriching the mixture to this  extent results in a power loss, both power and economy must  be sacrificed for engine cooling purposes.  

Many older, large, high-powered radial engines were  influenced by the cooling requirements on air-fuel mixture,  by effects of water injection.  Figure 10-46  shows an air-fuel  curve for a water-injection engine. The dotted portion of the  curve shows how the air-fuel mixture is leaned out during  water injection. This leaning is possible because water, rather  than extra fuel, is used as a cylinder coolant. These types of  systems are not used on modern aircraft.  

This permits leaning out to approximately best-power mixture  without danger of overheating or detonation. This leaning  out gives an increase in power. The water does not alter the  combustion characteristics of the mixture. Fuel added to the  auto-rich mixture in the power range during dry operation is  solely for cooling. A leaner mixture would give more power.  Actually, water or, more accurately, the antidetonant (water- alcohol) mixture is a better coolant than extra fuel. Therefore,  water injection permits higher manifold pressures and a still  further increase in power.  

In establishing the final curve for engine operation, the  engine’s ability to cool itself at various power settings is, of  course, taken into account. Sometimes the mixture must be  altered for a given installation to compensate for the effect  of cowl design, cooling airflow, or other factors on engine

cooling. The final air-fuel mixture curves take into account  economy, power, engine cooling, idling characteristics, and  all other factors that affect combustion.  

Figure 10-47  shows a typical final curve for a float-type  carburetor. Note that the air-fuel mixture at idle is the same  in rich and in manual lean. The mixture remains the same  until the low cruise range is reached. At this point, the curves  separate and then remain parallel through the cruise and  power ranges.  

Note the spread between the rich and lean setting in the  cruise range of both curves. Because of this spread, there  is a decrease in power when the mixture control is moved  from auto-rich to auto-lean with the engine operating in the  cruise range. This is true because the auto-rich setting in  the cruise range is very near the best power mixture ratio.

Figure 10-47.   Typical air-fuel mixture curve for a float-type  carburetor.  

Therefore, any leaning out gives a mixture that is leaner  than best power.  

# Idle Mixture  

The idle mixture curve shows how the mixture changes when  the idle mixture adjustment is changed.  [Figure 10-48]  Note  that the greatest effect is at idling speeds. However, there  is some effect on the mixture at airflows above idling. The  airflow at which the idle adjustment effect cancels out varies  from minimum cruise to maximum cruise. The exact point  depends on the type of carburetor and the carburetor setting.  In general, the idle adjustment affects the air-fuel mixture up  to low cruise on engines equipped with float-type carburetors.  This means that incorrect idle mixture adjustments can easily  give faulty cruise performance, as well as poor idling.  

There are variations in mixture requirements between  one engine and another because of the fuel distribution  within the engine and the ability of the engine to cool.  Remember, a carburetor setting must be rich enough to  supply a combustible mixture for the leanest cylinder. If fuel  distribution is poor, the overall mixture must be richer than  would be required for the same engine if distribution were  good. The engine’s ability to cool depends on such factors  as cylinder design (including the design of the cooling fins),  compression ratio, accessories on the front of the engine that  cause individual cylinders to run hot, and the design of the  baffling used to deflect airflow around the cylinder. At takeoff  power, the mixture must be rich enough to supply sufficient  fuel to keep the hottest cylinder cool.  

# Induction Manifold  

The induction manifold provides the means of distributing air,  or the air-fuel mixture, to the cylinders. Whether the manifold  handles an air-fuel mixture or air alone depends on the type  of fuel metering system used. On an engine equipped with  

![](images/13f2b06a46429c9846f6119844bb1ce0b092db9ec3bb25192e812418c3bbc3b0.jpg)  
Figure 10-48.   Idle mixture curve.  

a carburetor, the induction manifold distributes an air-fuel  mixture from the carburetor to the cylinders. On a fuel- injection engine, the fuel is delivered to injection nozzles,  one in each cylinder, that provide the proper spray pattern for  efficient burning. Thus, the mixing of fuel and air takes place  at the inlet port to the cylinder. On a fuel-injection engine  the induction manifold handles only air.  

The induction manifold is an important item because of the  effect it can have on the air-fuel mixture that finally reaches the  cylinder. Fuel is introduced into the airstream by the carburetor  in a liquid form. To become combustible, the fuel must be  vaporized in the air. This vaporization takes place in the  induction manifold, which includes the internal supercharger,  if one is used. Any fuel that does not vaporize clings to the  walls of the intake pipes. Obviously, this affects the effective  air-fuel ratio of the mixture that finally reaches the cylinder  in vapor form. This explains the reason for the apparently  rich mixture required to start a cold engine. In a cold engine,  some of the fuel in the airstream condenses out and clings to  the walls of the manifold. This is in addition to that fuel that  never vaporized in the first place. As the engine warms up,  less fuel is required because less fuel is condensed out of the  airstream and more of the fuel is vaporized, thus giving the  cylinder the required air-fuel mixture for normal combustion.  

Any leak in the induction system has an effect on the mixture  reaching the cylinders. This is particularly true of a leak at the  cylinder end of an intake pipe. At manifold pressures below  atmospheric pressure, such a leak leans out the mixture. This  occurs because additional air is drawn in from the atmosphere  at the leaky point. The affected cylinder may overheat, fire  intermittently, or even cut out altogether.  

# Operational Effect of Valve Clearance  

While considering the operational effect of valve clearance,  keep in mind that all aircraft reciprocating engines of current  design use valve overlap. Valve overlap is when the intake  and exhaust valves are open at the same time. This takes  advantage of the momentum of the entering and exiting gases  to improve the efficiency of getting air-fuel in and exhaust  gases out.  Figure 10-49  shows the pressures at the intake and  exhaust ports under two different sets of operating conditions.  In one case, the engine is operating at a manifold pressure  of   $35~"\mathrm{Hg}$  . Barometric pressure (exhaust back pressure) is   $29\,^{\circ}\mathrm{Hg}$  . This gives a pressure acting in the direction indicated  by the arrow of differential of 6 "Hg (3 psi).  

During the valve overlap period, this pressure differential  forces the air-fuel mixture across the combustion chamber  toward the open exhaust. This flow of air-fuel mixture forces  ahead of it the exhaust gases remaining in the cylinder,  resulting in complete scavenging of the combustion chamber.  

![](images/05a5836ca2fe20d76374d31180f43d2eecff353ed5237749e41203d85f0ac6be.jpg)  
Figure 10-49.   Effect of valve overlap.  

This, in turn, permits complete filling of the cylinder with  a fresh charge on the following intake event. This is the  situation in which valve overlap gives increased power.  

There is a pressure differential in the opposite direction  of   $9\ "\mathrm{Hg}$   (4.5 psi) when the manifold pressure is below  atmospheric pressure, for example,  $20\:"\mathrm{Hg}$  . These cause air  or exhaust gases to be drawn into the cylinder through the  exhaust port during valve overlap.  

In engines with collector rings, this inflow through the  exhaust port at low power settings consists of burned exhaust  gases. These gases are pulled back into the cylinder and mix  with the incoming air-fuel mixture. However, these exhaust  gases are inert; they do not contain oxygen. Therefore, the  air-fuel mixture ratio is not affected much. With open exhaust  stacks, the situation is entirely different. Here, fresh air  containing oxygen is pulled into the cylinders through the  exhaust. This leans out the mixture. Therefore, the carburetor  must be set to deliver an excessively rich idle mixture so that,  when this mixture is combined with the fresh air drawn in  through the exhaust port, the effective mixture in the cylinder  will be at the desired ratio.  

At first thought, it does not appear possible that the effect  of valve overlap on air-fuel mixture is sufficient to cause  concern. However, the effect of valve overlap becomes  apparent when considering idle air-fuel mixtures. These  mixtures must be enriched 20 to 30 percent when open stacks,  instead of collector rings (radial engines) are used on the  same engine.  [Figure 10-50]  Note the spread at idle between  an open stack and an exhaust collector ring installation for  engines that are otherwise identical. The mixture variation  decreases as the engine speed or airflow is increased from  idle into the cruise range.  

Engine, airplane, and equipment manufacturers provide a  powerplant installation that gives satisfactory performance.  Cams are designed to give best valve operation and correct  overlap. But valve operation is correct only if valve clearances  are set and remain at the value recommended by the engine  manufacturer. If valve clearances are set wrong, the valve  overlap period is longer or shorter than the manufacturer  intended. The same is true if clearances get out of adjustment  during operation.  

Where there is too much valve clearance, the valves do not  open as wide or remain open as long as they should. This  reduces the overlap period. At idling speed, it affects the  air-fuel mixture, since a less-than-normal amount of air or  exhaust gases is drawn back into the cylinder during the  shortened overlap period. As a result, the idle mixture tends  to be too rich.  

When valve clearance is less than it should be, the valve  overlap period is lengthened. A greater than normal amount  of air, or exhaust gases, is drawn back into the cylinder at  idling speeds. As a result, the idle mixture is leaned out at the  cylinder. The carburetor is adjusted with the expectation that  a certain amount of air or exhaust gases is drawn back into  the cylinder at idling. If more or less air, or exhaust gases,  are drawn into the cylinder during the valve overlap period,  the mixture is too lean or too rich.  

When valve clearances are wrong, it is unlikely that they are  all wrong in the same direction. Instead, there is too much  clearance on some cylinders and too little on others. Naturally,  

![](images/a99b203b7390a81356b797b9a52de2caf9247874ab81b144bff5b96524c1600a.jpg)  
Figure 10-50.   Comparison of air-fuel mixture curves for open-stack  and collector-ring installations.  

this gives a variation in valve overlap between cylinders.  This results in a variation in air-fuel ratio at idling and lower- power settings, since the carburetor delivers the same mixture  to all cylinders. The carburetor cannot tailor the mixture to  each cylinder to compensate for variation in valve overlap.  The effect of variation in valve clearance and valve overlap  on the air-fuel mixture between cylinders is illustrated in  Figure 10-51 . Note how the cylinders with too little clearance  run rich, and those with too much clearance run lean. Note  also the extreme mixture variation between cylinders.  

Valve clearance also effects volumetric efficiency. Any  variations in air-fuel into, and exhaust gases out of, the  cylinder affects the volumetric efficiency of the cylinder. With  the use of hydraulic valve lifters that set the valve clearance  automatically, engine operation has been greatly improved.  Hydraulic lifters do have a limited range in which they can  control the valve clearance, or they can become stuck in one  position that can cause them to be a source of engine trouble.  Normally engines equipped with hydraulic lifters require  little to no maintenance.  

# Engine Troubleshooting  

Troubleshooting is a systematic analysis of the symptoms  that indicate engine malfunction. It would be impractical to  list all the malfunctions that could occur in a reciprocating  engine, so only the most common malfunctions are discussed.  A thorough knowledge of the engine systems, applied with  logical reasoning, solves most problems that may occur.  

Figure 10-52  lists general conditions or troubles that may  be encountered on reciprocating engines, such as engine  fails to start. They are further divided into the probable  causes contributing to such conditions. Corrective actions  are indicated in the remedy column. The items are presented  with consideration given to frequency of occurrence, ease  of accessibility, and complexity of the corrective action  indicated.  

The need for troubleshooting normally is dictated by poor  operation of the complete powerplant. Power settings for the  type of operation at which any difficulty is encountered, in  many cases, indicate that part of the powerplant that is the  basic cause of difficulty.  

The cylinders of an engine, along with any type of  supercharging, form an air pump. Furthermore, the power  developed in the cylinders varies directly with the rate that  air can be consumed by the engine. Therefore, a measure  of air consumption or airflow into the engine is a measure  of power input. Ignoring for the moment such factors as  humidity and exhaust back pressure, the manifold pressure  gauge and the engine tachometer provide a measure of  engine air consumption. Thus, for a given rpm, any change  in power input is reflected by a corresponding change in  manifold pressure.  

The power output of an engine is the power absorbed by the  propeller. Therefore, propeller load is a measure of power  output. Propeller load, in turn, depends on the propeller  rpm, blade angle, and air density. For a given angle and air  

![](images/82428026a3dca296e971d2b4487bc1f820021649b557adb9a522339e382da1fd.jpg)  
Figure 10-51.   Effect of variation in valve overlap on air-fuel mixture between cylinders.  

![](images/02c3d9842f9e5c7902896f58b2ffb9fab0019f5ba37793376d431dfc046b9070.jpg)  

density, propeller load (power output) is directly proportional  to engine speed. The basic power of an engine is related to  manifold pressure, fuel flow, and rpm. Because the rpm of  the engine and the throttle opening directly control manifold  pressure, the primary engine power controls are the throttle  and the rpm control. An engine equipped with a fixed-pitch  propeller has only a throttle control. In this case, the throttle  setting controls both manifold pressure and engine rpm.  

With proper precautions, manifold pressure can be taken as a  measure of power input, and rpm can be taken as a measure  of power output. However, the following factors must be  

![](images/5af2b9965966ac7365c4967bbfbfafe8d34d4324efa855d4251d844a74d4bc2c.jpg)  

considered:  

1.	 Atmospheric pressure and air temperature must be  considered, since they affect air density. 2.	 These measures of power input and power output  should be used only for comparing the performance  of an engine with its previous performance, or for  comparing identical powerplants. 3.	 With a controllable propeller, the blades must be  against their low-pitch stops, since this is the only  blade position in which the blade angle is known and  does not vary. Once the blades are off their low-pitch  stops, the propeller governor takes over and maintains  a constant rpm, regardless of power input or engine  condition. This precaution means that the propeller  control must be set to maximum or takeoff rpm, and  the checks made at engine speeds below this setting.  

Having relative measures of power input and power output,  the condition of an engine can be determined by comparing  input and output. This is done by comparing the manifold  pressure required to produce a given rpm with the manifold  pressure required to produce the same rpm at a time when  the engine (or an identical powerplant) was known to be in  top operating condition.  

An example shows the practical application of this method of  determining engine condition. With the propeller control set for  takeoff rpm (full low blade angle), an engine may require 32  inches of manifold pressure to turn  ${}^{2,200\,\mathrm{rpm}}$   for the ignition  check. On previous checks, this engine required only 30 inches  of manifold pressure to turn   $2{,}200~\mathrm{rpm}$   at the same station  (altitude) and under similar atmospheric conditions. Obviously,  something is wrong; a higher power input (manifold pressure)  is now required for the same power output (rpm). There is a  good chance that one cylinder has a malfunction.  

There are several standards against which engine performance  can be compared. The performance of a particular engine can  be compared with its past performance, provided adequate  records are kept. Engine performance can be compared with  that of other engines on the same aircraft or aircraft having  identical installations.  

If a fault does exist, it may be assumed that the trouble lies  in one of the following systems:  

1.	 Ignition system. 2.	 Fuel-metering system. 3.	 Induction system. 4.	 Power section (valves, cylinders, etc.). 5.	 Instrumentation.  

If a logical approach to the problem is taken and the  instrument readings properly utilized, the malfunctioning  system can be pinpointed, and the specific problem in the  defective system can be singled out.  

The more information available about any particular problem,  the better the opportunity for a rapid repair. Information that  is of value in locating a malfunction includes:  

1.	 Was any roughness noted? Under what conditions of  operation? 2.	 What is the time on the engine and spark plugs? How  long since last inspection? 3.	 Was the ignition system operational check and power  check normal? 4.	 When did the trouble first appear? 5.	 Was backfiring or afterfiring present? 6.	 Was the full throttle performance normal?  

From a different point of view, the powerplant is, in reality,  a number of small engines turning a common crankshaft  and being operated by two common phases: fuel metering  and ignition. When backfiring, low power output or other  powerplant difficulty is encountered, first find out which  system, fuel metering or ignition, is involved and then  determine whether the entire engine or only one cylinder  is at fault. For example, backfiring normally is caused by:  

1.	 Valves holding open or sticking open in one or more  of the cylinders. 2.	 Lean mixture. 3.	 Intake pipe leakage. 4.	 An error in valve adjustment that causes individual  cylinders to receive too small a charge or one too large,  even though the mixture to the cylinders has the same  air-fuel ratio.  

Ignition system reasons for backfiring might be a cracked  distributor block or a high-tension leak between two ignition  leads. Either of these conditions could cause the charge in  the cylinder to be ignited during the intake stroke. Ignition  system troubles involving backfiring normally are not  centered in the basic magneto, since a failure of the basic  magneto would result in the engine not running, or it would  run well at low speeds but cut out at high speeds. On the other  hand, replacement of the magneto would correct a difficulty  caused by a cracked distributor where the distributor is a part  of the magneto.  

If the fuel system, ignition system, and induction system are  functioning properly, the engine should produce the correct  bhp unless some fault exists in the basic power section.  

# Valve Blow-By  

Valve blow-by is indicated by a hissing or whistle when  pulling the propeller through prior to starting the engine,  when turning the engine with the starter, or when running  and blow-by past the intake valve is audible through the  carburetor.  

Correct valve blow-by immediately to prevent valve failure  and possible engine failure by taking the following steps:  

1.	 Perform a cylinder compression test to locate the faulty  cylinder. 2.	 Check the valve clearance on the affected cylinder.  If the valve clearance is incorrect, the valve may be  sticking in the valve guide. To release the sticking  valve, place a fiber drift on the rocker arm immediately  over the valve stem and strike the drift several times  with a mallet. Sufficient hand pressure should be  exerted on the fiber drift to remove any space between  the rocker arm and the valve stem prior to hitting the  drift. 3.	 If the valve is not sticking and the valve clearance is  incorrect, adjust it as necessary. 4.	 Determine whether blow-by has been eliminated by  again pulling the engine through by hand or turning  it with the starter. If blow-by is still present, it may be  necessary to replace the cylinder.  

# Cylinder Compression Tests  

The cylinder compression test determines if the valves, piston  rings, and pistons are adequately sealing the combustion  chamber. If pressure leakage is excessive, the cylinder  cannot develop its full power. The purpose of testing cylinder  compression is to determine whether cylinder replacement  is necessary. The detection and replacement of defective  cylinders prevents a complete engine change because of  cylinder failure. It is essential that cylinder compression tests  be made periodically. Low compression, for the most part,  can be traced to leaky valves.  

Conditions that affect engine compression are:  

1.	 Incorrect valve clearances. 2.	 Worn, scuffed, or damaged piston. 3.	 Excessive wear of piston rings and cylinder walls. 4.	 Burned or warped valves. 5.	 Carbon particles between the face and the seat of the  valve or valves.  

Perform a compression test as soon as possible after the  engine is shut down so that piston rings, cylinder walls,  and other parts are still freshly lubricated. However, it is  not necessary to operate the engine prior to accomplishing  compression tests during engine buildup or on individually  replaced cylinders. In such cases, before making the test,  spray a small quantity of lubricating oil into the cylinder(s),  and turn the engine over several times to seal the piston and  rings in the cylinder barrel.  

Be sure that the ignition switch is in the OFF position so  that there is no accidental firing of the engine. Remove  necessary cowling and the most accessible spark plug from  each cylinder. When removing the spark plugs, identify  them to coincide with the cylinder. Close examination of  the plugs aid in diagnosing problems within the cylinder.  Review the maintenance records of the engine being tested.  Records of previous compression checks help in determining  progressive wear conditions and in establishing the necessary  maintenance actions.  

# Differential Pressure Tester  

The differential pressure tester checks the compression  of aircraft engines by measuring the leakage through the  cylinders. The design of this compression tester is such that  minute valve leakages can be detected, making possible the  replacement of cylinders where valve burning is starting. The  operation of the compression tester is based on the principle  that, for any given airflow through a fixed orifice, a constant  pressure drop across the orifice results.  

As the airflow and pressure changes, pressure varies  accordingly in the same direction. If air is supplied under  pressure to the cylinder with both intake and exhaust valves  closed, the amount of air that leaks by the valves or piston  rings indicates their condition; the perfect cylinder would  have no leakage. The differential pressure tester requires the  application of air pressure to the cylinder being tested with  the piston at top-center compression stroke.  [Figure 10-53]  

Guidelines for performing a differential compression test are:  

1.	 Perform the compression test as soon as possible after  engine shutdown to provide uniform lubrication of  cylinder walls and rings. 2.	 Remove the most accessible spark plug from the  cylinder, or cylinders, and install a spark plug adapter  in the spark plug insert. 3.	 Connect the compression tester assembly to a 100 to  150 psi compressed air supply.  [Figure 10-54]  With  the shutoff valve on the compression tester closed,  

![](images/3cef4b911708a427ba9ff0a2a1103ef02ae74d75eb41f2310e4b4714df6fefce.jpg)  
Figure 10-53.   Differential compression tester diagrams.  

adjust the regulator of the regulated pressure gauge  compression tester to obtain 80 psi.  

4.	 Open the shutoff valve and attach the air hose quick- connect fitting to the spark plug adapter. The shutoff  valve, when open, automatically maintains a pressure  in the cylinder of 15 to 20 psi when both the intake  and exhaust valves are closed.  

5.	 By hand, turn the engine over in the direction of rotation  until the piston in the cylinder being tested comes up  on the compression stroke against the 15 psi. Continue  turning the propeller slowly in the direction of rotation  until the piston reaches top dead center. Top dead center  can be detected by a decrease in force required to move  the propeller. If the engine is rotated past top dead  center, the 15 to 20 psi tends to move the propeller in the  direction of rotation. If this occurs, back the propeller up  at least one blade prior to turning the propeller again in  the direction of rotation. This backing up is necessary to  eliminate the effect of backlash in the valve-operating  

![](images/b3a3b111151fbcabb85d311c3040df3c02ad1901ebf8d678f5ca2c32c6a8927e.jpg)  
Figure 10-54.   Compression tester and adapter.  

mechanism and to keep the piston rings seated on the  lower ring lands.  

6.	 Close the shutoff valve in the compression tester and  re-check the regulated pressure to see that it is 80 psi  with air flowing into the cylinder. If the regulated  pressure is more or less than 80 psi, readjust the  regulator in the test unit to obtain 80 psi. When closing  the shutoff valve, make sure that the propeller path is  clear of all objects. There is sufficient air pressure in  the combustion chamber to rotate the propeller if the  piston is not on top dead center. 7.	 With regulated pressure adjusted to 80 psi, if the  cylinder pressure reading indicated on the cylinder  pressure gauge is below the minimum specified for the  engine being tested, move the propeller in the direction  of rotation to seat the piston rings in the grooves.  Check all the cylinders and record the readings.  

If low compression is obtained on any cylinder, turn the  engine through with the starter, or re-start, and run the engine  to takeoff power and re-check the cylinder, or cylinders,  having low compression.  

If the low compression is not corrected, remove the rocker- box cover and check the valve clearance to determine if the  difficulty is caused by inadequate valve clearance. If the low  compression is not caused by inadequate valve clearance,  place a fiber drift on the rocker arm immediately over the  valve stem and tap the drift several times with a 1 to 2 pound  hammer to dislodge any foreign material that may be lodged  between the valve and valve seat.  

After staking the valve in this manner, rotate the engine with  the starter and re-check the compression. Do not make a  compression check after staking a valve until the crankshaft  has been rotated either with the starter or by hand to re-seat  the valve in normal manner. The higher seating velocity  obtained when staking the valve will indicate valve seating,  even though valve seats are slightly egged or eccentric.  This procedure should only be performed if approved by  the manufacturer.  

Cylinders having compression below the minimum specified  should be further checked to determine whether leakage is  past the exhaust valve, intake valve, or piston. Excessive  leakage can be detected (during the compression check):  

1.	 At the exhaust valve by listening for air leakage at the  exhaust outlet; 2.	 At the intake valve by escaping air at the air intake;  and  3.	 Past the piston rings by escaping air at the engine  Next to valve blow-by, the most frequent cause of  compression leakage is excessive leakage past the piston.  This leakage may occur because of lack of oil. To check this  possibility, apply engine oil into the cylinder and around the  piston. Then, re-check the compression. If this procedure  raises compression to or above the minimum required,  continue the cylinder in service. If the cylinder pressure  readings still do not meet the minimum requirement, replace  the cylinder. When it is necessary to replace a cylinder as a  result of low compression, record the cylinder number and  the compression value of the newly installed cylinder on the  compression check sheet.  

# Cylinder Replacement  

Reciprocating engine cylinders are designed to operate for  a specified time before normal wear requires their overhaul.  If the engine is operated as recommended and proficient  maintenance is performed, the cylinders normally last until  the engine has reached its TBO. It is known from experience  that materials fail, and engines are abused through incorrect  operation; this has a serious effect on cylinder life. Another  reason for premature cylinder change is poor maintenance.  Therefore, exert special care to ensure that all the correct  maintenance procedures are adhered to when working on the  engine. Some of the reasons for cylinder replacement are:  

1.	 Low compression. 2.	 High oil consumption in one or more cylinders. 3.	 Excessive valve guide clearance. 4.	 Loose intake pipe flanges. 5.	 Loose or defective spark plug inserts. 6.	 External damage, such as cracks.  

The cylinder is always replaced as a complete assembly,  which includes piston, rings, valves, and valve springs.  Obtain the cylinder by ordering the cylinder assembly under  the part number specified in the engine parts catalog. Parts,  such as valve springs, rocker arms, and rocker box covers,  may be replaced individually.  

Normally, all the cylinders in an engine are similar, all are  standard size or all a certain oversize, and all are steel bore or  all are chrome-plated. The size of the cylinder is indicated by  a color code around the barrel between the attaching flange  and the lower barrel cooling fin. In some instances, air-cooled  engines are equipped with chrome-plated cylinders. Chrome- plated cylinders are usually identified by a paint band around  the barrel between the attaching flange and the lower barrel  cooling fin. This color band is usually international orange.  

When installing a chrome-plated cylinder, do not use  chrome-plated piston rings. The matched assembly includes  the correct piston rings. However, if a piston ring is broken  during cylinder installation, check the cylinder marking to  determine what ring, chrome-plated or otherwise, is correct  for replacement. Similar precautions must be taken to be sure  that the correct size rings are installed.  

Correct procedures and care are important when replacing  cylinders. Careless work or the use of incorrect tools can  damage the replacement cylinder or its parts. Incorrect  procedures in installing rocker-box covers may result in  troublesome oil leaks. Improper torque on cylinder hold down  nuts or cap-screws can easily result in a cylinder malfunction  and subsequent engine failure.  

# Cylinder Removal  

Since these instructions are meant to cover all air-cooled  engines, they are of a very general nature. The applicable  manufacturer’s maintenance manual should be consulted for  torque values and special precautions applying to a particular  aircraft and engine. However, always practice neatness  and cleanliness, and always protect openings so that nuts,  washers, tools, and miscellaneous items do not enter the  engine’s internal sections.  

Assuming that all obstructing cowling and brackets have  been removed, first remove the intake pipe and exhaust pipes.  Plug or cover openings in the intake or diffuser section. Then,  remove cylinder deflectors and any attaching brackets that  would obstruct cylinder removal. Loosen the spark plugs and  remove the spark plug lead clamps. Do not remove the spark  plugs until ready to pull the cylinder off. Remove the rocker  box covers. First, remove the nuts and then tap the cover  lightly with a rawhide mallet or plastic hammer. Never pry  the cover off with a screwdriver or similar tool.  

Loosen the pushrod packing gland nuts or hose clamps, top  and bottom. Pushrods are removed by depressing the rocker  arms with a special tool, or by removing the rocker arm.  Before removing the pushrods, turn the crankshaft until the  piston is at top dead center on the compression stroke. This  relieves the pressure on both intake and exhaust rocker arms.  It is also wise to back off the adjusting nut as far as possible,  because this allows maximum clearance for pushrod removal  when the rocker arms are depressed.  

On some model engines, or if the engine is rotated, tappets  and springs of lower cylinders can fall out. Provision must be  made to catch them as the pushrod and housing are removed. After removing the pushrods, examine them for markings or  mark them so that they may be replaced in the same location  as they were before removal. The ball ends are usually  worn to fit the sockets in which they have been operating.  Furthermore, on some engines, pushrods are not all of the  same length. A good procedure is to mark the pushrods near  the valve tappet ends No. 1 IN, No. 1 EX, No. 2 IN, No. 2 EX.,  etc. On fuel injection engines, disconnect the fuel injection  line and any line clamps that interfere with cylinder removal.  

The next step in removing the cylinder is to cut the lock wire  or remove the cotter pin, and pry off the locking device from  the cylinder-attaching cap-screws or nuts. Remove all the  screws or nuts except two located  $180^{\circ}$   apart. Use the wrench  specified for this purpose in the special tools section of the  applicable manual.  

Finally, while supporting the cylinder, remove the two  remaining nuts and gently pull the cylinder away from the  crankcase. Two technicians working together during this  step, as well as during the remaining procedure for cylinder  replacement, helps prevent damage or dropping of the  cylinder. After the cylinder skirt has cleared the crankcase,  but before the piston protrudes from the skirt, provide some  means (usually a shop cloth) for preventing pieces of broken  rings from falling into the crankcase. After the piston has  been removed, remove the cloths and carefully check that  all pieces were prevented from falling into the crankcase.  

Place a support on the cylinder mounting pad and secure it  with two cap-screws or nuts. Then, remove the piston and  ring assembly from the connecting rod. A pin pusher or puller  tool can be used when varnish makes it hard to remove the  pin. If the special tool is not available and a drift is used to  remove the piston pin, the connecting rod should be supported  so that it does not have to take the shock of the blows. If this  is not done, the rod may be damaged.  

After the removal of a cylinder and piston, the connecting  rod must be supported to prevent damage to the rod and  crankcase. This can be done by supporting each connecting  rod with the removed cylinder base oil seal ring looped  around the rod and cylinder base studs.  

Using a wire brush, clean the studs or cap-screws and  examine them for cracks, damaged threads, or any other  visible defects. If one cap-screw is found loose or broken  at the time of cylinder removal, all the cap-screws for the  cylinder should be discarded, since the remaining cap-screws  may have been seriously weakened. A cylinder hold down  stud failure places the adjacent studs under a greater operating  pressure, and they are likely to be stretched beyond their  elastic limit. The engine manufacturer’s instruction must be  followed for the number of studs that have to be replaced  after a stud failure. When removing a broken stud, take proper  precautions to prevent metal chips from entering the engine  crankcase section. In all cases, both faces of the washers and  the seating faces of stud nuts or cap-screws must be cleaned  

# Cylinder Installation  

See that all preservative oil accumulation on the cylinder and  piston assembly is washed off with solvent and thoroughly  dried with compressed air. Install the piston and ring assembly  on the connecting rod. Be sure that the piston faces in the  right direction. The piston number stamped on the bottom of  the piston head should face toward the front of the engine.  Lubricate the piston pin before inserting it. It should fit with  a push fit. If a drift must be used, follow the same precaution  that was taken during pin removal.  

Oil the exterior of the piston assembly generously, forcing oil  around the piston rings and in the space between the rings and  grooves. Stagger the ring gaps around the piston and check  to see that rings are in the correct grooves, and whether they  are positioned correctly, as some are used as oil scrapers,  others as pumper rings. The number, type, and arrangement  of the compression and oil-control rings vary with the make  and model of engine.  

Perform any and all visual, structural, and dimensional  inspection checks before installing the cylinder. Check the  flange to see that the mating surface is smooth and clean.  Coat the inside of the cylinder barrel generously with oil. Be  sure that the cylinder oil-seal ring is in place and that only  one seal ring is used.  

Using a ring compressor, compress the rings to a diameter  equal to that of the piston. With the piston at TDC, start the  cylinder assembly down over the piston, making certain  that the cylinder and piston plane remain the same. Ease  the cylinder over the piston with a straight, even movement  that moves the ring compressor as the cylinder slips on. Do  not rock the cylinder while slipping it on the piston, since  any rocking is apt to release a piston ring or a part of a ring  from the ring compressor prior to the ring’s entrance into the  cylinder bore. A ring released in this manner expands and  prevents the piston from entering the cylinder. Any attempt  to force the cylinder onto the piston is apt to cause cracking  or chipping of the ring or damage to the ring lands.  

After the cylinder has slipped on the piston, so that all piston  rings are in the cylinder bore, remove the ring compressor  and the connecting rod guide. Then, slide the cylinder into  place on the mounting pad. If cap-screws are used, rotate the  cylinder to align the holes. While still supporting the cylinder,  install two cap-screws or stud nuts   $180^{\circ}$   apart.  

Install the remaining nuts or cap-screws and tighten them  until they are snug. The hold down nuts, or cap-screws, must  now be torqued to the value specified in the table of torque  values in the engine manufacturer’s service or overhaul  manual. Apply the torque with a slow, steady motion until  the prescribed value is reached. Hold the tension on the  wrench for a sufficient length of time to ensure that the nut  or cap-screw tightens no more at the prescribed torque value.  In many cases, additional turning of the cap-screw, or nut,  as much as one-quarter turn can be done by maintaining  the prescribed torque on the nut for a short period of time.  After the stud nuts, or cap-screws, have been torqued to the  prescribed value, safety them in the manner recommended  in the engine manufacturer’s service manual.  

Reinstall the push rods, push rod housings, rocker arms, barrel  deflectors, intake pipes, ignition harness lead clamps and  brackets, fuel injection line clamps and fuel injection nozzles  (if removed), exhaust stack, cylinder head deflectors, and  spark plugs. Remember that the push rods must be installed  in their original locations and must not be turned end to end.  Make sure that the push rod ball end seats properly in the  tappet. If it rests on the edge or shoulder of the tappet during  valve clearance adjustment and later drops into place, valve  clearance is off.  

Furthermore, rotating the crankshaft with the push rod  resting on the edge of the tappet may bend the push rod.  After installing the push rods and rocker arms, set the valve  clearance. Before installing the rocker-box covers, lubricate  the rocker arm bearings and valve stems. Check the rocker- box covers for flatness; re-surface them if necessary. After  installing the gaskets and covers, tighten the rocker-box cover  nuts to the specified torque. Always follow the recommended  safety procedures.  

# Cold Cylinder Check  

The cold cylinder check determines the operating  characteristics of each cylinder of an air-cooled engine.  The tendency for any cylinder, or cylinders, to be cold,  or to be only slightly warm, indicates lack of combustion  or incomplete combustion within the cylinder. This must  be corrected if best operation and power conditions are to  be obtained. The cold cylinder check is made with a cold  cylinder indicator.  

Engine difficulties that can be analyzed by use of the cold  cylinder indicator are  [Figure 10-55] :  

1.	 Rough engine operation. 2.	 Excessive rpm drop during the ignition system check. 3.	 High manifold pressure for a given engine rpm during  the ground check when the propeller is in the full low- pitch position. 4.	 Faulty mixture ratios caused by improper valve  clearance.  

In preparation for the cold cylinder check, head the aircraft  into the wind to minimize irregular cooling of the individual  cylinders and to ensure even propeller loading during  engine operation.  

Operate the engine on its roughest magneto at a speed between  1,200 and   $1{,}600~\mathrm{rpm}$   until the cylinder head temperature  reading is stabilized. If engine roughness is encountered  at more than one speed, or if there is an indication that a  cylinder ceases operating at idle or higher speeds, run the  engine at each of these speeds, and perform a cold cylinder  check to pick out all the dead or intermittently operating  cylinders. When low power output or engine vibration is  encountered at speeds above   $1{,}600~\mathrm{rpm}$   when operating  with the ignition switch on both, run the engine at the speed  where the difficulty is encountered until the cylinder head  temperatures have stabilized.  

When cylinder head temperatures have reached the stabilized  values, stop the engine by moving the mixture control to  

![](images/a380ef8ae435f00fef6c0ba11bcfa74eb95bbe8c9ea90530d42effeacd831924.jpg)  
Figure 10-55.   Cold cylinder indicator.  

the idle cutoff or full lean position. When the engine ceases  firing, turn off both ignition and master switches. Record the  cylinder head temperature reading registered on the flight  deck gauge. As soon as the propeller has ceased rotating,  apply the instrument to each cylinder head, and record the  relative temperature of each cylinder. Start with number one  and proceed in numerical order around the engine, as rapidly  as possible. To obtain comparative temperature values, a firm  contact must be made at the same relative location on each  cylinder. Note any outstandingly low (cold) values. Compare  the temperature readings to determine which cylinders are  dead (cold cylinders) or are operating intermittently.  

Difficulties that may cause a cylinder to be inoperative  (dead) when isolated to one magneto, either the right or left  positions, are:  

1.	 Defective spark plugs. 2.	 Incorrect valve clearances. 3.	 Leaking intake pipes. 4.	 Lack of compression. 5.	 Defective spark plug lead. 6.	 Defective fuel-injection nozzle.  

Repeat the cold cylinder test for the other magneto positions  on the ignition switch, if necessary. Cooling the engine  between tests is unnecessary. The airflow created by the  propeller, and the cooling effect of the incoming air-fuel  mixture is sufficient to cool any cylinders that are functioning  on one test and not functioning on the next.  

In interpreting the results of a cold cylinder check,  remember that the temperatures are relative. A cylinder  temperature taken alone means little, but when compared  with the temperatures of other cylinders on the same engine,  it provides valuable diagnostic information. The readings  shown in  Figure   ${\mathit{l0-56}}$   illustrate this point. On this check,  the cylinder head temperature gauge reading at the time the  engine was shut down was   $160~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   on both tests.  

A review of these temperature readings reveals that, on the  right magneto, cylinder number 3 runs cool and cylinders  5 and 6 run cold. This indicates that cylinder 3 is firing  intermittently, and cylinders 5 and 6 are dead during engine  operation on the plugs fired by the right magneto. Cylinders  4 and 6 are dead during operation on the plugs fired by the  left magneto. Cylinder 6 is completely dead. An ignition  system operational check would not disclose this dead  cylinder, since the cylinder is inoperative on both right and  left switch positions.  

![Figure 10-56.   Readings taken during a cold cylinder check.  ](images/5a46bec427da56d71342f7dda372d77c58033adc157419770f1571993d678e1c.jpg)  

manifold pressure to produce any given rpm below the cut-in  speed of the propeller governor. A dead cylinder could also  be detected by comparing power input and power output with  the aid of a torquemeter.  

Defects within the ignition system that can cause a cylinder  to go completely dead are:  

1.	 Both spark plugs inoperative. 2.	 Both ignition leads grounded, leaking, or open. 3.	 A combination of inoperative spark plugs and  defective ignition leads. 4.	 Faulty fuel-injection nozzles, incorrect valve  clearances, and other defects outside the ignition  system.  

In interpreting the readings obtained on a cold cylinder  check, the amount the engine cools during the check must be  considered. To determine the extent to which this factor should  be considered in evaluating the readings, re-check some of  the first cylinders tested, and compare the final readings with  those made at the start of the check. Another factor to be  considered is the normal variation in temperature between  cylinders and between rows. This variation results from those  design features that affect the airflow past the cylinders.  

# Turbine Engine Maintenance  

Turbine powerplant maintenance procedures vary widely  according to the design and construction of the particular  engine being serviced. The detailed procedures recommended  by the engine manufacturer should be followed when  performing inspections or maintenance. Maintenance  information presented in this section is not intended to specify  the exact manner in which maintenance operations are to be  performed but is included to convey a general idea of the  procedures involved. For inspection purposes, the turbine  engine is divided into two main sections: the cold and hot.  

A dead cylinder can be detected during run-up, since an  engine with a dead cylinder requires a higher than normal  

# Compressor Section  

Maintenance of the compressor, or cold section, is one of  concern because damage to blades can cause engine failure.  Much of the damage to the blades arises from foreign  matter being drawn into the turbine engine air intakes. The  atmosphere near the ground is filled with tiny particles of  dirt, oil, soot, and other foreign matter. A large volume of  air is introduced into the compressor, and centrifugal force  throws the dirt particles outward so that they build up to form  a coating on the casing, the vanes, and the compressor blades. Accumulation of dirt on the compressor blades reduces  the aerodynamic efficiency of the blades with resultant  deterioration in engine performance. The efficiency of the  blades is impaired by dirt deposits in a manner similar to that  of an aircraft wing under icing conditions. Unsatisfactory  acceleration and high exhaust gas temperature can result from  foreign deposits on compressor components.  

An end result of foreign particles, if allowed to accumulate  in sufficient quantity, would be inefficiency. The condition  can be remedied by periodic inspection, cleaning, and repair  of compressor components.  

# Inspection & Cleaning  

Minor damage to axial-flow engine compressor blades may  be repaired if the damage can be removed without exceeding  the allowable limits established by the manufacturer. Typical  compressor blade repair limits are shown in  Figure 10-57 .  Well-rounded damage to leading and trailing edges that is  evident on the opposite side of the blade is usually acceptable  without re-work, provided the damage is in the outer half of  the blade only, and the indentation does not exceed values  specified in the engine manufacturer’s service and overhaul  instruction manuals. When working on the inner half of the  blade, damage must be treated with extreme caution. Repaired  compressor blades are inspected by either magnetic particle  or fluorescent penetrant inspection methods to ensure that all  traces of the damage have been removed. All repairs must be  well blended so that surfaces are smooth.  [Figure 10-58]  No  cracks of any extent are tolerated in any area.  

Whenever possible, stoning and local re-work of the blade  should be performed parallel to the length of the blade. Re- work must be accomplished by hand, using stones, files, or  emery cloth. Do not use a power tool to buff the entire area  of the blade. The surface finish in the repaired area must  be comparable to that of a new blade. On centrifugal flow  engines, it is difficult to inspect the compressor inducers  without first removing the air-inlet screen. After removing  the screen, clean the compressor inducer and inspect it with  a strong light. Check each vane for cracks by slowly turning  the compressor. Look for cracks in the leading edges. A crack  is usually cause for component rejection. The compressor  inducers are normally the parts that are damaged by the  impingement of foreign material during engine operation.  

Compressor inducers are repaired by stoning out and blending  the nicks and dents in the critical band (  $.1\%$   to   $2\%$   inches  from the outside edge), if the depth of such nicks or dents  does not exceed that specified in the engine manufacturer’s  service or overhaul instruction manuals. Repair nicks by  stoning out material beyond the depth of damage to remove  the resulting cold-worked metal. A generous radius must be  applied at the edges of the blend. After blending the nick, it  should be smoothed over with a crocus cloth. Pitting nicks or  corrosion found on the sides of the inducer vanes are similarly  removed by blending.  

# Causes of Blade Damage  

Loose objects often enter an engine either accidentally or  through carelessness. Foreign object damage (FOD), such as  pencils, tools, and flashlights, are often drawn into the engine  and can cause damage to the fan blades.  [Figure 10-59] Do not carry any objects in pockets when working around  operational turbine engines.  

A compressor rotor can be damaged beyond repair by tools  that are left in the air intake, where they are drawn into the  engine on subsequent starts. A simple solution to the problem  is to check the tools against a tool checklist. Prior to starting  a turbine engine, make a minute inspection of engine inlet  ducts to assure that items, such as nuts, bolts, lock wire, or  tools, were not left there after work had been performed.  

Figure 10-60  shows some examples of blade damage to an  axial-flow engine. The descriptions and possible causes of  blade damage are given in  Figure 10-61 . Corrosion pitting  is not considered serious on the compressor stator vanes  of axial-flow engines if the pitting is within the allowed  tolerance. Do not attempt to repair any vane by straightening,  brazing, welding, or soldering. Crocus cloth, fine files, and  stones are used to blend out damage by removing a minimum  of material and leaving a surface finish comparable to that  of a new part. The purpose of this blending is to minimize  stresses that concentrate at dents, scratches, or cracks.  

The inspection and repair of air intake guide vanes, swirl  vanes, and screens on centrifugal-flow engines necessitates  the use of a strong light. Inspect screen assemblies for breaks,  rips, or holes. Screens may be tin-dipped to tighten the wire  mesh, provided the wires are not worn too thin. If the frame  strip or lugs have separated from the screen frames, re-brazing  may be necessary.  

Inspect the guide and swirl vanes for looseness. Inspect the  outer edges of the guide vanes, paying particular attention to  

![](images/a6bc45df7fa3d20b8d947a3eeccc9718fdbfcd954b7bd23c1c2c4d400fb22cd4.jpg)

Figure 10-59.   Fan blade damage.  

the point of contact between the guides and swirl vanes for  cracks and dents due to the impingement of foreign particles.  Inspect the edges of the swirl vanes. Inspect the downstream  edge of the guide vanes very closely, because cracks are  generally more prevalent in this area. Cracks that branch or  fork out so that a piece of metal could break free and fall into  the compressor are cause for vane rejection.  

# Blending & Replacement  

Because of the thin-sheet construction of hollow vanes,  blending on the concave and convex surfaces, including the  leading edge, is limited. Small, shallow dents are acceptable  if the damage is of a rounded or gradual contour type and  not a sharp or V-type, and if no cracking or tearing of vane  material is evident in the damaged area.  

Trailing edge damage may be blended, if one-third of the weld  seam remains after repair.  [Figure 10-62]  Concave surfaces  of rubber-filled vanes may have allowable cracks extending  inward from the outer airfoil, provided there is no suggestion  of pieces breaking away. Using a light and mirror, inspect  each guide vane trailing edge and vane body for cracks or  damage caused by foreign objects.  

Any inspection and repair of turbine compressor section  components require that the technician always use the  specific manufacturer’s current information for evaluation  and limits of repairs.  

# Combustion Section Inspection  

One of the controlling factors in the service life of the turbine  engine is the inspection and cleaning of the hot section.  Emphasis must be placed on the importance of careful  inspection and repair of this section.  

The following are general procedures for performing a hot  section (turbine and combustion section) inspection. It is not  intended to imply that these procedures are to be followed  when performing repairs or inspections on turbine engines.  However, the various practices are typical of those used on  many turbine engines. Where a clearance or tolerance is  shown, it is for illustrative purposes only. Always follow  the instructions contained in the applicable manufacturer's  maintenance and overhaul manuals.  

The entire external combustion case should be inspected for  evidence of hot spots, exhaust leaks, and distortions before the  case is opened. After the combustion case has been opened,  the combustion chambers can be inspected for localized  overheating, cracks, or excessive wear.  [Figure 10-63] Inspect the first stage turbine blades and nozzle guide vanes  for cracks, warping, or FOD. Also inspect the combustion  chamber outlet ducts and turbine nozzle for cracks and for  evidence of FOD.  

One of the most frequent discrepancies that are detected while  inspecting the hot section of a turbine engine is cracking.  These cracks may occur in many forms, and the only way  to determine that they are within acceptable limits or if  they are allowed at all, is to refer to the applicable engine  manufacturer’s service and overhaul manuals.  

Cleaning the hot section is not usually necessary for a repair  in the field, but in areas of high salt water or other chemicals  a turbine rinse should be accomplished.  

Engine parts can be degreased by using the emulsion-type  cleaners or chlorinated solvents. The emulsion-type cleaners  are safe for all metals, since they are neutral and noncorrosive.  Cleaning parts by the chlorinated solvent method leaves the  parts absolutely dry. If they are not to be subjected to further  cleaning operations, they should be sprayed with a corrosion- preventive solution to protect them against rust or corrosion.  

The hot section, which generally includes the combustion  section and turbine sections, normally require inspections at  regular intervals. The extent of disassembly of the engine to  accomplish this inspection varies from different engine types.  Most engines require that the combustion case be open for  the inspection of the hot section. However, in performing this  disassembly, numerous associated parts are readily accessible  for inspection. The importance of properly supporting the  engine and the parts being removed cannot be overstressed.  

The alignment of components being removed and installed  is also of the utmost importance. After all the inspections  and repairs are made, the manufacturer’s detailed assembly  instructions should be followed. These instructions are  important in efficient engine maintenance, and the ultimate  life and performance of the engine. Extreme care must be  

![](images/d3ab6d302c00e3d6d4898abb25062d53c17657ad05e46fc88ddfba73c08b1e02.jpg)

taken during assembly to prevent dirt, dust, cotter pins, lock  wire, nuts, washers, or other foreign material from entering  the engine.  

# Marking Materials for Combustion Section Parts  

Certain materials may be used for temporary marking during  assembly and disassembly. Always refer to manufacturer’s  information for marking parts. Layout dye (lightly applied),  a felt tip marker, or chalk may be used to mark parts that are  

![](images/740670cc43bca7f229c4628457735f579587d47a5f37f6ad2a64c2cf569f9055.jpg)  
Figure 10-63.   Combustion case inspection.  

directly exposed to the engine’s gas path, such as turbine  blades and discs, turbine vanes, and combustion chamber  liners. A wax marking pencil may be used for parts that are  not directly exposed to the gas path. Do not use a wax marking  pencil on a liner surface or a turbine rotor. The use of carbon  alloy or metallic pencils is not recommended because of the  possibility of causing intergranular corrosion attack, that  could result in a reduction in material strength and cracking.  

# Inspection & Repair of Combustion Chambers  

Inspect the combustion chambers and covers for cracks by  using visible dye or fluorescent penetrant inspection method.  Any cracks, nicks, or dents are usually cause for rejecting the  component. Inspect the covers, noting particularly the area  around the fuel drain bosses for any pits or corrosion. When  repairing the combustion chamber liner, the procedures given  in the appropriate engine manufacturer’s overhaul instruction  manual should be followed. If there is doubt that the liner is  serviceable, it should be replaced.  

Combustion chambers should be replaced or repaired if two  cracks are progressing from a free edge so that their meeting  is imminent and could allow a piece of metal that could  cause turbine damage to break loose. Separate cracks in  the baffle are acceptable. Cracks in the cone are rare but, at  any location on this component, is cause for rejection of the  liner. Cracks in the swirl vanes are cause for rejection of the  liner. Loose swirl vanes may be repaired by silver brazing.  Cracks in the front liner emanating from the air holes are  acceptable, provided they do not exceed allowable limits.  If such cracks fork or link with others, the liner must be  repaired. If two cracks originating from the same air hole are  diametrically opposite, the liner is acceptable. Radial cracks  extending from the interconnector and spark igniter boss  are acceptable, if they do not exceed allowable limits and if  such cracks do not fork or link with others. Circumferential  cracks around the boss pads should be repaired prior to re-use  of the liner. Baffle cracks connecting more than two holes  should be repaired.  

After long periods of engine operation, the external surfaces  of the combustion chamber liner location pads often show  signs of fretting. This is acceptable, provided no resultant  cracks or perforation of the metal is apparent. Any cover  or chamber inadvertently dropped on a hard surface or  mishandled should be thoroughly inspected for minute  cracks that may elongate over a period of time and then open,  creating a hazard.  

Parts may be found where localized areas have been heated  to an extent to buckle small portions of the chamber. Such  parts are considered acceptable if the burning of the part  has not progressed into an adjacent welded area, or to such  an extent as to weaken the structure of the liner weldment.  Buckling of the combustion chamber liner can be corrected  by straightening the liner. Moderate buckling and associated  cracks are acceptable in the row of cooling holes. More severe  buckling that produces a pronounced shortening or tilting  of the liner is cause for rejection. Upon completion of the  repairs by welding, the liner should be restored as closely as  possible to its original shape.  

# Fuel Nozzle & Support Assemblies  

Clean all carbon deposits from the nozzles by washing with  a cleaning fluid approved by the engine manufacturer and  remove the softened deposits with a soft bristle brush. It  is desirable to have filtered air passing through the nozzle  during the cleaning operation to carry away deposits as they  are loosened. Make sure all parts are clean. Dry the assemblies  with clean, filtered air. Because the spray characteristics of  the nozzle may become impaired, no attempt should be made  to clean the nozzles by scraping with a hard implement or  by rubbing with a wire brush. Inspect each component part  of the fuel nozzle assembly for nicks and burrs. Many fuel  nozzles can be checked by flowing fluid through the nozzle  under pressure and closely checking the flow pattern coming  for the nozzle.  

# Turbine Disc Inspection  

The inspection for cracks is very important because cracks are  not normally allowed. Crack detection, when dealing with the  turbine disc and blades, is mostly visual, although structural  inspection techniques can be used, such as penetrant  methods and others to aid in the inspection. Cracks on the  disc necessitate the rejection of the disc and replacement of  the turbine rotor. Slight pitting caused by the impingement  of foreign matter may be blended by stoning and polishing.  

# Turbine Blade Inspection  

Turbine blades are usually inspected and cleaned in the  same manner as compressor blades. However, because of  the extreme heat under which the turbine blades operate,  they are more susceptible to damage. Using a strong light  and a magnifying glass, inspect the turbine blades for  stress rupture cracks and deformation of the leading edge.  [Figures 10-64  and  10-65]  

Stress rupture cracks usually appear as minute hairline  cracks on or across the leading or trailing edge at a right  angle to the edge length. Visible cracks may range in length  from one-sixteenth inch upward. Deformation, caused by  over-temperature, may appear as waviness and/or areas of  varying airfoil thickness along the leading edge. The leading  edge must be straight and of uniform thickness along its  entire length, except for areas repaired by blending. Do not  confuse stress rupture cracks or deformation of the leading  edge with foreign material impingement damage or with  

![](images/ffd0582002c5a36396b916956c5c0f5ab3ce70a8d2454fc198be55f7829d91cc.jpg)

Figure 10-65.   Turbine blade waviness.  

blending repairs to the blade. When any stress rupture cracks  or deformation of the leading edges of the first-stage turbine  blades are found, an over-temperature condition must be  suspected. Check the individual blades for stretch and the  turbine disc for hardness and stretch. Blades removed for  a detailed inspection or for a check of turbine disc stretch  must be re-installed in the same slots from which they were  removed. Number the blades prior to removal.  

The turbine blade outer shroud should be inspected for air seal  wear. If shroud wear is found, measure the thickness of the  shroud at the worn area. Use a micrometer or another suitable  and accurate measuring device that ensures a good reading  in the bottom of the comparatively narrow wear groove. If  the remaining radial thickness of the shroud is less than that  specified, the stretched blade must be replaced. Typical blade  inspection requirements are indicated in  Figure 10-66 . Blade  tip curling within a one-half inch square area on the leading  edge of the blade tip is usually acceptable if the curling is not  sharp. Curling is acceptable on the trailing edge if it does not  extend beyond the allowable area. Any sharp bends that may  result in cracking or a piece breaking out of the turbine blade  is cause for rejection, even though the curl may be within  the allowable limits. Each turbine blade should be inspected  for cracks.  

# Turbine Blade Replacement Procedure  

Turbine blades are generally replaceable, subject to moment- weight limitations. These limitations are contained in the  

![](images/dd04e7968defc648742c586cbceae7f1b46c3b9caa20d9b0315cf431a01644f2.jpg)  

engine manufacturer’s applicable technical instructions. If  visual inspection of the turbine assembly discloses several  broken, cracked, or eroded blades, replacing the entire  turbine assembly may be more economical than replacing  the damaged blades.  [Figure 10-67]  

In the initial buildup of the turbine, a complete set of 54  blades made in coded pairs (two blades having the same  code letters) is laid out on a bench in the order of diminishing  moment-weight. The code letters, indicating the moment- weight balance in ounces, are marked on the rear face of the  fir-tree section of the blade (viewing the blade as installed  at final assembly of the engine). The pair of blades having  the heaviest moment-weight is numbered 1 and 28; the  next heaviest pair of blades is numbered 2 and 29; the third  heaviest pair is numbered 3 and 30. This is continued until  all the blades have been numbered. Mark a number 1 on the  face of the hub on the turbine disc. The number 1 blade is then  installed adjacent to the number 1 on the disc.  [Figure 10-68]  

The remaining blades are then installed consecutively in a  clockwise direction, viewed from the rear face of the turbine  disc. If there are several pairs of blades having the same  code letters, they are installed consecutively before going  to the next code letters. If a blade requires replacement, the  diametrically opposite blade must also be replaced. Computer  programs generally determine the location for turbine blades  for turbine wheels on modern engines.  

# Turbine Nozzle Inlet Guide Vane Inspection  

After removing the required components, the first stage  turbine blades and turbine nozzle vanes are accessible

for inspection. The blade limits specified in the engine  manufacturer’s overhaul and service instruction manual  should he adhered to.  Figure 10-69  shows where cracks  usually occur on a turbine nozzle assembly. Slight nicks and  dents are permissible if the depth of damage is within limits. Inspect the nozzle vanes for nicks or cracks. Small nicks  are not cause for vane rejection, provided such nicks blend  out smoothly.  

Inspect the nozzle vane supports for defects caused by the  impingement of foreign particles. Use a stone to blend any  doubtful nicks to a smooth radius. Like turbine blades, it is  possible to replace a maximum number of turbine nozzle  vanes in some engines. If more than the maximum vanes  are damaged, a new turbine nozzle vane assembly must be  installed. With the tailpipe (exhaust nozzle) removed, the rear  turbine stage can be inspected for any cracks or evidence of  blade stretch. Additional nozzle stages can also be inspected  with a strong light by looking through the rear-stage turbine.  

# Clearances  

Checking the clearances is one of the procedures in the  maintenance of the turbine section of a turbine engine.  The manufacturer’s service and overhaul manual gives the  procedures and tolerances for checking the turbine. Turbine  clearances being measured at various locations are shown  in  Figures 10-70  and  10-71 . To obtain accurate readings,  special tools provided by each manufacturer must be used  

![](images/29367957df713d2a783946ce5b77cfbf3c13429ad86ac17e06bec834adebc80e.jpg)  
Figure 10-69.   Turbine nozzle assembly defects.  

# Exhaust Section  

The exhaust section of the turbine engine is susceptible to  heat cracking. This section must be thoroughly inspected  along with the inspection the combustion section and turbine  section of the engine. Inspect the exhaust cone and exhaust  nozzle for cracks, warping, buckling, or hot spots. Hot spots  on the tail cone are a good indication of a malfunctioning  fuel nozzle or combustion chamber.  

The inspection and repair procedures for the hot section  of any one gas turbine engine share similarities to those  of other gas turbine engines. One usual difference is the  nomenclature applied to the various parts of the hot section  by the different manufacturers. Other differences include the  manner of disassembly, the tooling necessary, and the repair  methods and limits.  

# Engine Ratings  

The flat rating of a turbine engine is the thrust performance  that is guaranteed by the manufacturer for a new engine under  specific operating conditions, such as takeoff, maximum  continuous climb, and cruise power settings. The turbine inlet  temperature is proportional to the energy available to turn  the turbine. This means that the hotter the gases are that are  entering the turbine section of the engine, the more power is  available to turn the turbine wheel. The exhaust temperature  is proportional to the turbine inlet temperature. Regardless of  how or where the exhaust temperature is taken on the engine  for the flight deck reading, this temperature is proportional to  the temperature of the exhaust gases entering the first stage  of inlet guide vanes. A higher EGT corresponds to a larger  amount of energy to the turbine so it can turn the compressor  faster. This works fine until the temperature reaches a point  when the turbine inlet guide vanes start to be damaged. EGT  must be held constant or lowered as the result of a prolonged  hot section life and, at the same time, provide the thrust to  meet the certification requirements.  

Before high bypass turbofan engines, some older types of  engines used water injection to increase thrust for takeoff  (wet). This is the maximum allowable thrust for takeoff. The  rating is obtained by actuating the water-injection system and  setting the computed wet thrust with the throttle, in terms of a  predetermined turbine discharge pressure or engine pressure  ratio for the prevailing ambient conditions. The rating is  restricted to takeoff, is time-limited, and has an altitude  limitation. Water injection is not used very much on turbine  engines any more.

# Turbine Engine Instruments  

# Engine Pressure Ratio Indicator  

Engine pressure ratio (EPR) is an indication of the thrust  being developed by a turbofan engine and is used to set power  for takeoff on many types of aircraft. It is instrumented by  total pressure pickups in the engine inlet (Pt2) and in the  turbine exhaust (Pt7). The reading is displayed in the flight  deck by the EPR gauge, which is used in making engine  power settings.  [Figure 10-72]  

# Torquemeter (Turboprop Engines)  

Only 10 to 15 percent of the thrust produced by a turboprop  engine is from propulsive force derived from the jet thrust  exiting the exhaust. Engine pressure ratio is not used as an  indicator of the power produced by a turboprop engine.  Turboprops are usually fitted with a torquemeter that  measures torque applied to a shaft turned by the gas generator  and power turbines of the turbine engine. The torquemeter can  be operated by engine oil pressure metered through a valve  that is controlled by a helical ring gear that moves in response  to the applied torque.  [Figure 10-73]  This gear moves against  a piston that controls the opening of a valve, which controls  the oil pressure flow. This action makes the oil pressure  proportional to torque being applied at the propeller shaft.  Generally, transducer is used to transfer the oil pressure into  an electrical signal to be read by the flight deck instrument.  The read out in the flight deck is normally in lb/ft of torque,  or percent horsepower. The torquemeter is very important  as it is used to set power settings. This instrument must be  calibrated at intervals to assure its accuracy.  

# Tachometer  

Gas turbine engine speeds are measured by the engines  rpm, which are also the compressor/turbine combination  rpm of each rotating spool. Most turbofan engines have  two or more spools, compressor, and turbine sections that  turn independently at different speeds. Tachometers are  usually calibrated in percent rpm so that various types of  engines can be operated on the same basis of comparison.  [Figure 10-73]  Also, turbine speeds are generally very high,  and the large numbers of rpm would make it very confusing.  Turbofan engines with two spools or separate shafts, high  

![](images/09ad99a5e4812ce14bc9a0209c29dd7aadc8f68cde30881d2c9e4d396ba482a6.jpg)  
Figure 10-72.   Engine pressure ratio indications.  

pressure and low pressure spools, are generally referred to as  N1 and N2, with each having their own indicator. The main  purpose of the tachometer is to be able to monitor rpm under  normal conditions, during an engine start, and to indicate an  overspeed condition, if one occurs.  

# Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicator (EGT)  

Exhaust gas temperature (EGT), turbine inlet temperature,  (TIT), turbine gas temperature (TGT), interstage turbine  temperature (ITT), and turbine outlet temperature (TOT) are  all relative temperatures used to monitor the temperature of  the exhaust gases entering the first stage turbine inlet guide  vanes. Even though these temperatures are taken at different  locations on the engine (each engine having one location),  they are all relative to the temperature of the gases entering  the first stage turbine inlet guide vanes.  

Temperature is an engine operating limit and is used to  monitor the mechanical integrity of the turbines, as well as to  check engine operating conditions. Actually, the temperature  of the gases entering the first stage turbine inlet guide vanes  is the important consideration, since it is the most critical  of all the engine variables. However, it is impractical to  measure turbine inlet temperature in most engines, especially  large engines. Consequently, temperature thermocouples  are inserted at the turbine discharge, where the temperature  provides a relative indication of that at the inlet. Although  the temperature at this point is much lower than at the inlet,  it provides surveillance over the engine’s internal operating  conditions. Several thermocouples are usually used, that  are spaced at intervals around the perimeter of the engine  exhaust duct near the turbine exit. The EGT indicator in the  flight deck shows the average temperature measured by the  individual thermocouples.  [Figure 10-73]  

# Fuel-Flow Indicator  

Fuel-flow instruments indicate the fuel flow in pounds per  hour   $(1\mathrm{b/hr})$   from the engine fuel control. Fuel flow in turbine  aircraft is measured in lb/hr instead of gallons, because  the fuel weight is a major factor in the aerodynamics of  large turbine aircraft. Fuel flow is of interest in monitoring  fuel consumption and checking engine performance.  [Figure 10-73]  

# Engine Oil Pressure Indicator  

To guard against engine failure resulting from inadequate  lubrication and cooling of the various engine parts, the  oil supply to critical areas must be monitored. The oil  pressure indicator usually shows the engine oil pump  discharge pressure.  

# Engine Oil Temperature Indicator  

The ability of the engine oil to lubricate and cool depends  on the temperature of the oil, as well as the amount of  

![](images/924b90d0db80191cea9c78914c04b0984603b01e6c74b56236cf1c2c47b42017.jpg)  
Figure 10-73.  Typical turbine engine instruments.  

oil supplied to the critical areas. An oil inlet temperature  indicator frequently is provided to show the temperature  of the oil as it enters the oil pressure pump. Oil inlet  temperature is also an indication of proper operation of the  engine oil cooler.  

# Turbine Engine Operation  

The engine operating procedures presented here apply  generally to turbofan, turboprop, turboshaft, and auxiliary  power units (APU). The procedures, pressures, temperatures,  and rpm that follow are intended primarily to serve as a  guide. It should be understood that they do not have general  application. The manufacturer’s operating instructions  should be consulted before attempting to start and operate  any turbine engine.  

A turbofan engine has only one power control lever. Adjusting  the power lever, or throttle lever, sets up a thrust condition  for which the fuel control meters fuel to the engine. Engines  equipped with thrust reversers go into reverse thrust at throttle  positions below idle. A separate fuel shutoff lever is usually  provided on engines equipped with thrust reversers.  

Prior to start, particular attention should be paid to the  engine air inlet, the visual condition and free movement of  the compressor and turbine assembly, and the parking ramp  area fore and aft of the aircraft. The engine is started by using  an external air power source, APU, or an already operating  engine. Starter types and the engine starting cycle have been  discussed previously. On multi-engine aircraft, the engines  are usually started by an onboard APU that supplies the air  pressure for a pneumatic starter on each engine. Air bled from  the APU is used as a source of power for starting the engines.  

During the start, it is necessary to monitor the tachometer,  the oil pressure, and the exhaust gas temperature. The normal  starting sequence is:  

1.	 Rotate the compressor with the starter; 2.	 Turn the ignition on; and 3.	 Open the engine fuel valve, either by moving the  throttle to idle or by moving a fuel shutoff lever or  turning a switch.  

Adherence to the procedure prescribed for a particular engine  is necessary as a safety measure and to avoid a hot or hung  start. A successful start is noted first by a rise in exhaust gas  temperature. If the engine does not light up, meaning that fuel  starts to burn inside of the engine within a prescribed period  of time, or if the exhaust gas starting temperature limit is  exceeded, a hot start, the starting procedure should be aborted.  Hot starts are not common, but when they do occur, they can  usually be stopped in time to avoid excessive temperature by  observing the exhaust gas temperature constantly during the  start. When necessary, the engine is cleared of trapped fuel or  gases by continuing to rotate the compressor with the starter,  but with the ignition and fuel turned off. If the engine did not  light off during start after the allotted time, about 10 seconds  although this time varies from engine to engine, the fuel must  be shut off as the engine is being filled with unburned fuel. A  hung start is when the engine lights off, but the engine will  not accelerate to idle rpm.  

# Ground Operation Engine Fire  

Move the fuel shutoff lever to the off position if an engine  fire occurs, or if the fire warning light is illuminated during  the starting cycle. Continue cranking or motoring the engine  until the fire has been expelled from the engine. If the fire  persists,  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   can be discharged into the inlet duct while it is  being cranked. Do not discharge  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   directly into the engine  exhaust, because it may damage the engine. If the fire cannot  be extinguished, secure all switches and leave the aircraft. If  the fire is on the ground under the engine overboard drain,  discharge the  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   on the ground rather than on the engine.  This also is true if the fire is at the tailpipe and the fuel is  dripping to the ground and burning.  

# Engine Checks  

Checking turbofan engines for proper operation consists  primarily of simply reading the engine instruments and then  comparing the observed values with those known to be correct  for any given engine operating condition. After the engine  has started, idle rpm has been attained, and the instrument  readings have stabilized, the engine should be checked  for satisfactory operation at idling speed. The oil pressure  indicator, tachometer, and the exhaust gas temperature  readings should be compared with the allowable ranges.  

# Checking Takeoff Thrust  

Takeoff thrust is checked by adjusting the throttle to obtain  a single, predicted reading on the engine pressure ratio  indicator in the aircraft. The value for engine pressure ratio,  which represents takeoff thrust for the prevailing ambient  atmospheric conditions, is calculated from a takeoff thrust  setting curve or, on newer aircraft, is a function of the onboard  computer. This curve has been computed for static conditions.  [Figure 10-74]  Therefore, for all precise thrust checking,  the aircraft should be stationary, and stable engine operation  should be established. If it is needed for calculating thrust  during an engine trim check, turbine discharge pressure (Pt7)  is also shown on these curves. Appropriate manuals should  be consulted for the charts for a specific make and model  engine. Engine trimming procedure is also covered in Chapter  2, Engine Fuel & Fuel Metering Systems. The engine pressure  ratio computed from the thrust setting curve represents thrust  or a lower thrust call part power thrust used for testing. The  aircraft throttle is advanced to obtain this predicted reading  on the engine pressure ratio indicator, or the part power stop  is engaged in the aircraft. If an engine develops the predicted  thrust and if all the other engine instruments are reading  within their proper ranges, engine operation is considered  satisfactory. Full authority digital engine controls (FADEC)  (computer controls) also have means of checking the engine  with the results displayed on the flight deck.  

# Ambient Conditions  

The sensitivity of gas turbine engines to compressor inlet air  temperature and pressure necessitates that considerable care  be taken to obtain correct values for the prevailing ambient  air conditions when computing takeoff thrust. Some things  to remember are:  

1.	 The engine senses the air temperature and pressure at  the compressor inlet. This is the actual air temperature  just above the runway surface. When the aircraft is  stationary, the pressure at the compressor inlet is  the static field or true barometric pressure, and not  the barometric pressure corrected to sea level that  is normally reported by airport control towers as the  altimeter setting. On FADEC engines, the computer  reads this information and sends it to the engine  controls.  

2.	 Temperature sensed is the total air temperature (TAT)  that is used by several onboard computers. The engine  controls set the engine computers according to the  TAT.  

3.	 Relative humidity, which affects reciprocating engine  power appreciably, has a negligible effect on turbine  engine thrust, fuel flow, and rpm. Therefore, relative  humidity is not usually considered when computing  thrust for takeoff or determining fuel flow and rpm  for routine operation.  

# Engine Shutdown  

On turbine engines that have a thrust reverser, retarding the  aircraft throttle to idle or power lever to OFF cuts the fuel  supply to the engine and shuts down the engine. On engines  equipped with thrust reversers, this is accomplished by means  of a separate fuel shutoff lever or switch. When an engine  has been operated at high power levels for extended periods  of time, a cool down time should be allowed before shutting  down. It is recommended the engine be operated at below a  low power setting, preferably at idle for a period of 5 minutes  to prevent possible seizure of the rotors. This applies, in  particular, to prolonged operation at high rpm on the ground,  such as during engine trimming. The turbine case and the  turbine wheels operate at approximately the same temperature  

![](images/ab259626ccbcd42edbe30c5e0cec5639609c73a1cfcf1e3d6334a8b90372a34f.jpg)  
Figure 10-74.   Typical takeoff thrust setting curve for static conditions.  

when the engine is running. However, the turbine wheels  are relatively massive, compared with the case, and are not  cooled so readily. The turbine case is exposed to cooling  air from both inside and outside the engine. Consequently,  the case and the wheels lose their residual heat at different  rates after the engine has been shut down. The case, cooling  faster, tends to shrink upon the wheels, that are still rotating.  Under extreme conditions, the turbine blades may squeal or  seize; thus, a cooling period is required if the engine has been  operating at prolonged high speed. Should the turbine wheels  seize, no harm normally results, provided no attempt is made  to turn the engine over until it has cooled sufficiently to free  the wheels. In spite of this, every effort should be made to  avoid seizure.  

To ensure that fuel remains in the lines and that the engine- driven fuel pumps are not starved for fuel that lubricates the  pumps, the aircraft fuel boost pump must be turned off after,  not before, the throttle or the fuel shutoff lever is placed in  the OFF position.  

Generally, an engine should not be shut down by the fuel  shutoff lever until after the aircraft throttle has been retarded  to idle. Because the fuel shutoff valve is located on the fuel  control discharge, a shutdown from high thrust settings results  in high fuel pressures within the control that can harm the  fuel system parts.  

When an accurate reading of the oil level in the oil tank is  needed following an engine shutdown, the engine should  be operated and shut down with the oil check taking place  within not more than 30 minutes after shutdown. Check the  engine manuals for the specific procedure.  

# Troubleshooting Turbine Engines  

Included in this section are typical guidelines for locating  engine malfunctions on most turbine engines. Since it would  be impractical to list all the malfunctions that could occur,  only the most common malfunctions are covered. A thorough  knowledge of the engine systems, applied with logical  reasoning, solves most problems that may occur.  

Figure 10-75  enumerates some malfunctions that may be  encountered. Possible causes and suggested actions are given  in the adjacent columns. The malfunctions presented herein  are solely for the purpose of illustration and should not be  construed to have general application. For exact information  about a specific engine model, consult the applicable  manufacturer’s instructions.  

# Turboprop Operation  

Turboprop engine operation is quite similar to that of a  turbojet engine, except for the added feature of a propeller.  

The starting procedure and the various operational features  are very much alike. The turboprop chiefly requires attention  to engine operating limits, the throttle or power lever setting,  and the torquemeter pressure gauge. Although torquemeters  indicate only the power being supplied to the propeller and  not the equivalent shaft horsepower, torquemeter pressure  is approximately proportional to the total power output  and, thus, is used as a measure of engine performance. The  torquemeter pressure gauge reading during the takeoff engine  check is an important value. It is usually necessary to compute  the takeoff power in the same manner as is done for a turbojet  engine. This computation is to determine the maximum  allowable exhaust gas temperature and the torquemeter  pressure that a normally functioning engine should produce  for the outside, or ambient, air temperature and barometric  pressure prevailing at the time.  

# Troubleshooting Procedures for Turboprop Engines  

All test run-ups, inspections, and troubleshooting  should be performed in accordance with the applicable  engine manufacturer’s instructions. In  Figure 10-76 , the  troubleshooting procedure for the turboprop reduction gear,  torquemeter, and power section are combined because of their  inter-relationships. The table includes the principal troubles,  together with their probable causes and remedies.  

# Turbine Engine Calibration & Testing  

Some of the most important factors affecting turbine engine  life are EGT, engine cycles (a cycle is generally a takeoff  and landing) and engine speed. Excess EGT of a few degrees  reduces turbine component life. Low EGT materially reduces  turbine engine efficiency and thrust. So, to make the engine  highly efficient, the exhaust temperatures need to be as high  as possible, while maintaining an EGT operating temperature  that does not damage the turbine section of the engine. If the  engine is operated at excess exhaust temperatures, engine  deterioration occurs. Since the EGT temperature is set by the  EGT temperature gauge, it is imperative that it is accurate.  Excessive engine speed can cause premature engine wear  and, if extreme, can cause engine failure.  

One older type of calibration test unit used to analyze the  turbine engine is the jetcal analyzer.  [Figure 10-77]  A jetcal  analyzer is a portable instrument made of aluminum, stainless  steel, and plastic. The major components of the analyzer  are the thermocouple, rpm, EGT indicator, resistance, and  insulation check circuits, as well as the potentiometer,  temperature regulators, meters, switches, and all the necessary  cables, probes, and adapters for performing all tests.  

# Turbine Engine Analyzer Uses  

Many different types of analyzers are used each with its own  function, including onboard systems that use computers to  

![Figure 10-75.   Troubleshooting turbojet engines.  ](images/d0619d9ac9fe0220d24c178176a2fb3f2f2d79f45b6082db9424701e2bea6f47.jpg)  

![Figure 10-75.   Troubleshooting turbojet engines (continued).  ](images/cc7cd52b9bd25fd8685c63a192863ac687d2f679c11c64651002efa0551fcc23.jpg)  

test aircraft systems. Depending upon the specific analyzer  used, procedures vary somewhat, but the basic test are  outlined here. Always refer to the specific instructions  associated with the analyzer being used.  

# Most analyzers may be used to:  

1.	 Functionally check the aircraft EGT system for error,  without running the engine or disconnecting the  wiring. 2.	 Check individual thermocouples before placement in  a parallel harness. 3.	 Check each engine thermocouple in a parallel harness  for continuity. 4.	 Check the thermocouples and parallel harness for  accuracy. 5.	 Check the resistance of the EGT circuit. 6.	 Check the insulation of the EGT circuit for shorts to  ground, or for shorts between leads. 7.	 Check EGT indicators , either in or out of the aircraft,  for error. 8.	 Determine engine rpm accuracy during engine testing.  Added to this is the checking and troubleshooting of  the aircraft tachometer system.  

9.	 Establish the proper relationship between the EGT  and engine rpm during engine run-up.  

# Analyzer Safety Precautions  

Observe the following safety precautions while operating the  engine analyzer or other types of test equipment:  

1.	 Never use a voltammeter to check the potentiometer  for continuity. If a voltammeter is used, damage to the  galvanometer and standard battery cell results. 2.	 Check the thermocouple harness before engine run-up.  This must be done because the circuit must be correct  before the thermocouples can be used for true EGT  pickup. 3.	 For safety, ground the jetcal analyzer when using an  AC power supply. Any electrical equipment operated  on AC power and utilizing wire-wound coils, such as  the probes with the jetcal analyzer, has an induced  voltage on the case that can be discharged if the  equipment is not grounded. This condition is not  apparent during dry weather, but on damp days the  operator can be shocked slightly. Therefore, for the  operator’s protection, the jetcal analyzer should be  grounded using the pigtail lead in the power inlet  cable. 4.	 Use heater probes designed for use on the engine  

![Figure 10-76.   Troubleshooting turboprop engines.  ](images/b59fac3ff6d7fc9867b2a6f482be09a16a29205e7407ac1542f5b713adcc0215.jpg)  

![](images/e8953120460f5c5765372577eca28da91ed7e809344a63ca0b981a6eb7ba50ef.jpg)  
Figure 10-77.   Jetcal analyzer instrument compartment.  

thermocouples to be tested. Temperature gradients are  very critical in the design of heater probes. Each type  of aircraft thermocouple has its own specially designed  probe. Never attempt to modify heater probes to test  other types of thermocouples. 5.	 Do not leave heater probe assemblies in the exhaust  nozzle during engine run-up. 6.	 Never allow the heater probes to go over  $900\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (1,652   $^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ). Exceeding these temperatures results in damage  to the jetcal analyzer and heater probe assemblies.  

# Continuity Check of Aircraft EGT Circuit  

To eliminate any error caused by one or more inoperative  aircraft thermocouples, a continuity check is performed.  The check is made by heating one heater probe to between  500 and   $700~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and placing the hot probe over each of the  aircraft thermocouples, one at a time. The EGT indicator must  show a temperature rise as each thermocouple is checked.  When large numbers (eight or more) of thermocouples are  used in the harness, it is difficult to see a rise on the aircraft  instrument because of the electrical characteristics of a  parallel circuit. Therefore, the temperature indication of the  aircraft thermocouples is read on the potentiometer of the  analyzer by using the check cable and necessary adapter.  

# Functional Check of Aircraft EGT Circuit  

During the EGT system functional test and the thermocouple  harness checks, the analyzer has a specific degree of accuracy at  the test temperature, which is usually the maximum operating  temperature of the turbine engine.  [Figure 10-78]  Each engine  has its own maximum operating temperature, that can be  found in applicable technical instructions.  

The test is made by heating the engine thermocouples in  the exhaust nozzle or turbine section to the engine test  temperature. The heat is supplied by heater probes through  the necessary cables. With the engine thermocouples hot,  their temperature is registered on the aircraft EGT indicator.  At the same time, the thermocouples embedded in the heater  probes, which are completely isolated from the aircraft  system, are picking up and registering the same temperature  on the test analyzer.  

The temperature registered on the aircraft EGT indicator  should be within the specified tolerance of the aircraft system  and the temperature reading on the temperature analyzer.  When the temperature difference exceeds the allowable  tolerance, troubleshoot the aircraft system.  

![](images/c0c11b0eb75fe729101f7250c9b932caa82f63b2c921d8f2017c0b507d836a3c.jpg)  
Figure 10-78.   EGT analyzer.  

# EGT Indicator Check  

The EGT indicator is tested after being removed from the  aircraft instrument panel and disconnected from the aircraft  EGT circuit leads. Attach the instrument cable and EGT  indicator adapter leads to the indicator terminals and place  the indicator in its normal operating position. Adjust the  analyzer switches to the proper settings. The indicator reading  should correspond to the readings of the analyzer within the  allowable limits of the EGT indicator.  

Correction for ambient temperature is not required for this  test, as both the EGT indicator and analyzer are temperature  compensated. The temperature registered on the aircraft  EGT indicator should be within the specified tolerance  of the aircraft system and the temperature reading on the  analyzer readout. When the temperature difference exceeds  the allowable tolerance, troubleshoot the aircraft system.  

# Resistance & Insulation Check  

The thermocouple harness continuity is checked while the  EGT system is being checked functionally. The resistance  of the thermocouple harness is held to very close tolerances,  since a change in resistance changes the amount of current  flow in the circuit. A change of resistance gives erroneous  temperature readings. The resistance and insulation check  circuits make it possible to analyze and isolate any error in  the aircraft system. How the resistance and insulation circuits  are used is discussed with troubleshooting procedures.  

# Tachometer Check  

To read engine speed with an accuracy of  $\pm0.1$   percent during  engine run, the frequency of the tachometer-generator (older  style) is measured by the rpm check analyzer. The scale of the  rpm check circuit is calibrated in percent rpm to correspond to  the aircraft tachometer indicator, which also reads in percent  rpm. The aircraft tachometer and the rpm check circuit are  connected in parallel, and both are indicating during engine  run-up. The rpm check circuit readings can be compared  with the readings of the aircraft tachometer to determine the  accuracy of the aircraft instrument.  

Many newer engines use a magnetic pickup that counts  passing gear teeth edges, which are seen electrically as  pulses of electrical power as they pass by the pickup.  [Figure 10-79]  By counting the amount of pulses, the rpm  of the shaft is obtained. This type of system requires little  maintenance, other than setting the clearance between the  gear teeth and the magnetic pickup.  

# Troubleshooting EGT System  

An appropriate analyzer is used to test and troubleshoot the  aircraft thermocouple system at the first indication of trouble,  or during periodic maintenance checks.  

The test circuits of the analyzer make it possible to isolate  the troubles listed below. Following the list is a discussion  of each trouble mentioned.  

1.	 One or more inoperative thermocouples in engine  parallel harness. 2.	 Engine thermocouples out of calibration. 3.	 EGT indicator error. 4.	 Resistance of circuit out of tolerance. 5.	 Shorts to ground. 6.	 Shorts between leads.  

# One or More Inoperative Thermocouples in  Engine Parallel Harness  

This error is found in the regular testing of aircraft  thermocouples with a hot heater probe and is a broken lead  wire in the parallel harness, or a short to ground in the harness.  In the latter case, the current from the grounded thermocouple  can leak off and never be shown on the indicator. However,  this grounded condition can be found by using the insulation  resistance check.  

# Engine Thermocouples Out of Calibration  

When thermocouples are subjected for a period of time  to oxidizing atmospheres, such as encountered in turbine  engines, they drift appreciably from their original calibration.  On engine parallel harnesses, when individual thermocouples  can be removed, these thermocouples can be bench-checked,  using one heater probe. The temperature reading obtained  from the thermocouples should be within manufacturer’s  tolerances.

Figure 10-79.   Magnetic pickup and gear.  

# EGT Circuit Error  

This error is found by using the EGT and comparing the  reading of the aircraft EGT indicator with the analyzer  temperature reading.  [Figure 10-78]  The analyzer and aircraft  temperature readings are then compared.  

# Resistance of Circuit Out of Tolerance  

The engine thermocouple circuit resistance is a very  important adjustment since a high-resistance condition gives  a low indication on the aircraft EGT indicator. This condition  is dangerous, because the engine is operating with excess  temperature, but the high resistance makes the indicator  read low. It is important to check and correct this condition.  

# Shorts to Ground/Shorts Between Leads  

These errors are found by doing the insulation check using  an ohmmeter. Resistance values from zero to 550,000 ohms  can be read on the insulation check ohmmeter by selecting  the proper range.  

# Troubleshooting Aircraft Tachometer System  

A function of the rpm check is troubleshooting the aircraft  tachometer system. The rpm check circuit in the analyzer  is used to read engine speed during engine run-up with an  accuracy of  $\pm0.1$   percent. The connections for the rpm check  are the instrument cable and aircraft tachometer system lead  to the tachometer indicator. After the connections have been  made between the analyzer rpm check circuit and the aircraft  tachometer circuit, the two circuits, now classed as one, are  a parallel circuit. The engine is then run-up as prescribed in  applicable technical instructions. Both systems can be read  simultaneously.  

If the difference between the readings of the aircraft  tachometer indicator and the analyzer rpm check circuit  exceeds the tolerance prescribed in applicable technical  instructions, the engine must be stopped, and the trouble  

# Chapter 11 Light-Sport Aircraft Engines  

# Engine General Requirements  

Engines used for light-sport aircraft and other types of  aircraft, such as some experimental aircraft, ultralight  aircraft, and powered parachutes, must be very light for  the power they develop. Each aircraft requires thrust to  provide enough forward speed for the wings to provide lift  to overcome the weight of the aircraft. An aircraft that meets  the requirements of the light-sport categories must meet the  following requirements.  

Note:  All of the following requirements and regulations are  subject to change. Always refer to the latest Federal Aviation  Regulations for current information.  

A light-sport aircraft means an aircraft, other than a rotorcraft  or powered-lift, since its original certification, has continued  to meet the following:  

1.	 A maximum takeoff weight of not more than 1,320  pounds (lb) (600 kilograms   $(\mathbf{kg})$  ) for aircraft not  intended for operation on water; or 1,430 lb   $(650\,\mathrm{kg})$    for an aircraft intended for operation on water.  2.	 A maximum airspeed in level flight with maximum  continuous power   $\mathrm{(V_{H})}$   of not more than 120 knots  calibrated airspeed (CAS) under standard atmospheric  conditions at sea level.  3.	 A maximum never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$   of not more  than 120 knots CAS for a glider.  4.	 A maximum stalling speed or minimum steady flight  speed without the use of lift-enhancing devices   $(\mathrm{V_{S1}})$   of not more than 45 knots CAS at the aircraft’s  maximum certificated takeoff weight and most critical  center of gravity.  5.	 A maximum seating capacity of no more than two  persons, including the pilot.  6.	 A single, reciprocating engine, if powered.  7.	 A fixed or ground-adjustable propeller, if a powered  aircraft other than a powered glider.  8.	 A fixed or auto-feathering propeller system, if a  powered glider.  9.	 A fixed-pitch, semirigid, teetering, two-blade rotor  system, if a gyroplane.  10.	 A non-pressurized cabin, if equipped with a cabin.  11.	 Fixed landing gear, except for an aircraft intended for  

operation on water or a glider.  

12.	 Fixed or retractable landing gear, or a hull, for an  aircraft intended for operation on water.  

13.	 Fixed or retractable landing gear for a glider.  

Powered parachute means a powered aircraft comprised of  a flexible or semirigid wing connected to a fuselage so that  the wing is not in position for flight until the aircraft is in  motion. The fuselage of a powered parachute contains the  aircraft engine, a seat for each occupant, and is attached to  the aircraft’s landing gear.  

Weight shift control aircraft means a powered aircraft with  a framed pivoting wing and a fuselage controllable only in  pitch and roll by the pilot’s ability to change the aircraft’s  center of gravity with respect to the wing. Flight control of  the aircraft depends on the wing’s ability to flexibly deform  rather than the use of control surfaces.  

As the weight of an engine is decreased, the useful load that  an aircraft can carry and the performance of the aircraft are  obviously increased. Every excess pound of weight carried  by an aircraft engine reduces its performance. Since light- sport aircraft have a narrow margin of useful load, engine  weight is a very important concern with all of the light, low  airspeed aircraft. Tremendous gains in reducing the weight of  the aircraft engine through improvements in design, operating  cycles, and metallurgy have resulted in engines with a much  improved power to weight ratio.  

A light-sport aircraft engine is reliable when it can perform  at the specified ratings in widely varying flight attitudes and  in extreme weather conditions. The engine manufacturer  ensures the reliability and durability of the product by design,  research, and testing. Although most of these engines are not  certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),  close control of manufacturing and assembly procedures is  generally maintained, and normally each engine is tested  before it leaves the factory and meets certain American  Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards.  Some engines used on light-sport aircraft are certificated  by the FAA and these engines are maintained as per the  manufacturer’s instructions and Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

Most light-sport engines require a definite time interval  between overhauls. This is specified or implied by the engine  manufacturer. The time between overhauls (TBO) varies  with the type of engine (cycle), operating conditions, such as  engine temperatures, amount of time the engine is operated  at high-power settings, and the maintenance received. After  reaching the time limit, the engine has to be overhauled.  Sometimes this requires the engine to be shipped to an  authorized manufacturer’s overhaul facility.  [Figure 11-1]  

One consideration when selecting a light-sport engine is the  shape, size, and number of cylinders of the engine. Since  these engines range from single cylinder to multicylinder  engines, the mounting in the airframe is important to maintain  the view of the pilot, aircraft center of gravity, and to reduce  aircraft drag.  

# Personnel Authorized to Perform Inspection  & Maintenance on Light-Sport Engines  

Given they meet all applicable regulations, the holder of  a powerplant certificate can perform maintenance and  inspections on light-sport engines. The holder of a sport  pilot certificate may perform preventive maintenance on  an aircraft owned or operated by that pilot and issued a  special airworthiness certificate in the light-sport category  under the provisions of 14 CFR part 43, section 43.3 (g). All  maintenance must be performed in accordance with 14 CFR  part 65, section 65.81,  which describes specific experience  requirements and current instructions for performing  maintenance.

![Figure 11-1.   Examples of TBO and calendar life for engines. ](images/3f0d62e0959f8844fda2aafc364034d93ec86e754d68c6c622df9e9d259d23a4.jpg)  

The holder of a repairman certificate (light-sport aircraft)  with an inspection rating may perform the annual condition  inspection on a light-sport aircraft that is owned by the  holder, has been issued an experimental certificate for  operating a light-sport aircraft under 14 CFR part 21, section  21.191(i), and is in the same class of light-sport aircraft for  which the holder has completed the training specified in the  above paragraphs.  

The holder of a repairman certificate (light-sport aircraft)  with a maintenance rating may approve and return to service  an aircraft that has been issued a special Airworthiness  Certificate in the light-sport category under 14 CFR part  21, section 21.190, or any part thereof, after performing  or inspecting maintenance (to include the annual condition  inspection and the 100-hour inspection required by 14 CFR  part 91, section 91.327), preventive maintenance, or an  alteration (excluding a major repair or a major alteration on a  product produced under an FAA approval). They may perform  the annual condition inspection on a light-sport aircraft that  has been issued an experimental certificate for operating a  light-sport aircraft under 14 CFR part 21, section 21.191(i).  However, they may only perform maintenance, preventive  maintenance, and an alteration on a light-sport aircraft for  which the holder has completed the training specified in the  preceding paragraphs. Before performing a major repair, the  holder must complete additional training acceptable to the  FAA and appropriate to the repair performed.  

The holder of a repairman certificate (light-sport aircraft) with  a maintenance rating may not approve for return to service  any aircraft or part thereof unless that person has previously  performed the work concerned satisfactorily. If that person  has not previously performed that work, the person may  show the ability to do the work by performing it under  the direct supervision of a certificated and appropriately  rated mechanic, or a certificated repairman who has had  previous experience in the specific operation concerned. The  repairman may not exercise the privileges of the certificate  unless the repairman understands the current instructions  of the manufacturer and the maintenance manuals for the  specific operation concerned.  

# Authorized Personnel That Meet FAA Regulations  

All applicable aviation regulatory authority regarding  maintenance procedures must be met. Maintenance  organizations and personnel are encouraged to contact the  manufacturer for more information and guidance on any of  the maintenance procedures.  

It is a requirement that every individual or maintenance  provider possess the required special tooling, training,  or experience to perform all tasks outlined. Maintenance  providers that meet the following conditions outlined below  may perform engine maintenance providing they meet all of  the following FAA requirements:  

•	 Knowledge of the specific task as a result of receiving  authorized training from a training provider.  •	 Previous experience in performing the task and formal  instruction from a manufacturer’s authorized training  facility or “on-the-job” instruction by a manufacturer’s  representative.  • 	 A suitable work environment to prevent contamination  or damage to engine parts or modules is needed.  • 	 Suitable tools and fixtures as outlined in the  manufacturers’ Maintenance Manual should be used  while performing maintenance requiring such tooling.  • 	 Reasonable and prudent maintenance practices should  be utilized.  

# Types of Light-Sport & Experimental Engines  

Note:  All information in this text is for educational  illustrational purposes and is not to be used for actual aircraft  maintenance. This information is not revised at the same  rate as the maintenance manual; always refer to the current  maintenance information when performing maintenance on  any engine.  

# Light-Sport Aircraft Engines  

Light-sport/ultralight aircraft engines can be classified  by several methods, such as by operating cycles, cylinder  arrangement, and air- or water-cooled. An inline engine  generally has two cylinders, is two-cycle, and is available  in several horsepower ranges. These engines may be either  liquid-cooled, air-cooled, or a combination of both. They  have only one crankshaft that drives the reduction gearbox or  propeller directly. Most of the other cylinder configurations  used are horizontally opposed, ranging from two to six  cylinders from several manufacturers. These engines are  either gear reduction or direct drive.  

# Two-Cycle, Two Cylinder Rotax Engine  Rotax 447 UL Single Capacitor Discharge Ignition  (SCDI) & Rotax 503 UL Dual Capacitor Discharge  Ignition (DCDI)  

The Rotax inline cylinder arrangement has a small frontal  area and provides improved streamlining.  [Figure 11-2]  The  two cylinder, inline two-stroke engine, which is piston ported  with air-cooled cylinder heads and cylinders, is available in  a fan or free air-cooled version. Being a two-stroke cycle  engine, the oil and fuel must be mixed in the fuel tank on  some models. Other models use a lubrication system, such  as the 503 oil injection lubrication system. This system does  not mix the fuel and oil as the oil is stored in a separate tank.  

![](images/b932885e9ce69799b4543b28038fa86a87867c558883d4de17e7b8460c20e002.jpg)  
Figure 11-2.  Rotax inline cylinder arrangement.  

As the engine needs lubrication, the oil is injected directly  from this tank. The typical ignition system is a breakerless  ignition system with a dual ignition system used on the 503,  and a single ignition system used on the 447 engine series.  Both systems are of a magneto capacitor discharge design.  

The engine is equipped with a carburetion system with one  or two piston-type carburetors. One pneumatic driven fuel  pump delivers the fuel to the carburetors. The propeller is  driven via a flange connected gearbox with an incorporated  shock absorber. The exhaust system collects the exhaust  gases and directs them overboard. These engines come with  an integrated alternating current (AC) generator (12V 170W)  with external rectifier-regulator as an optional extra.  

# Rotax 582 UL DCDI  

The Rotax 582 is a two-stroke engine, two cylinder inline  with rotary valve inlet, has liquid-cooled cylinder heads, and  cylinders that use an integrated water pump.  [Figure 11-3]   The lubrication system can be a fuel-oil mixture or oil  injection lubrication. The ignition system is a dual ignition  using a breakerless magneto capacitor discharge design. Dual  piston type carburetors and a pneumatic fuel pump deliver  the fuel to the cylinders. The propeller is driven via the prop  flange connected gearbox with an incorporated torsional  vibration shock absorber. This engine also uses a standard  version exhaust system with an electric starter or manual  rewind starter.  

# Description of Systems for Two-Stroke Engines Cooling System of Rotax 447 UL SCDI & Rotax 503  UL DCDI  

Two versions of air-cooling are available for these engines.  The first method is free air-cooling, which is a process of  engine cooling by an air-stream generated by aircraft speed  

![](images/6ad5984b7b6f158475e4e3c6a550247f490f59c2099ef945998eace0b2817e71.jpg)

and propeller. The second is fan cooling, which is cooling  by an air-stream generated by a fan permanently driven from  the crankshaft via a V-belt.  

# Cooling System of the Rotax 582 UL DCDI  

Engine cooling for the Rotax 582 is accomplished by liquid  cooled cylinders and cylinder heads.  [Figure 11-4]  The  cooling system is in a two circuit arrangement. The cooling  liquid is supplied by an integrated pump in the engine  through the cylinders and the cylinder head to the radiator.  The cooling system has to be installed, so that vapor coming  from the cylinders and the cylinder head can escape to the  top via a hose, either into the water tank of the radiator or  to an expansion chamber. The expansion tank is closed by a  pressure cap (with excess pressure valve and return valve).  As the temperature of the coolant rises, the excess pressure  valve opens, and the coolant flows via a hose at atmospheric  pressure to the transparent overflow bottle. When cooling  down, the coolant is sucked back into the cooling circuit.  

# Lubrication Systems  

# Oil Injection Lubrication of Rotax 503 UL DCDE &  582 UL DCDI  

Generally, the smaller two cycle engines are designed to run  on a mixture of gasoline and 2 percent oil that is premixed  in the fuel tank. The engines are planned to run on an oil- gasoline mixture of 1:50. Other engines use oil injection  systems that use an oil pump driven by the crankshaft via the  pump gear that feeds the engine with the correct amount of  fresh oil. The oil pump is a piston type pump with a metering  system. Diffuser jets in the intake inject pump supplied two- stroke oil with the exact proportioned quantity needed. The  oil quantity is defined by the engine rotations per minute and  the oil pump lever position. This lever is actuated via a cable  connected to the throttle cable. The oil comes to the pump  

![](images/900a252faca94f10b018ca3a701c2680423ccadb8218a6fc584c127d5c81683c.jpg)

from an oil tank by gravity.  

Note:  In engines that use oil injection, the carburetors are  fed with pure gasoline (no oil-gasoline mixture). The oil  quantity in the oil tank must be checked before putting the  engine into service as the oil is consumed during operation  and needs to be replenished.  

# Electric System  

The 503 UL DCDI, 582 UL DCDI engine types are equipped  with a breakerless, single capacitor discharge ignition unit  with an integrated generator.  [Figure 11-5]  The   $447\ \mathrm{UL}$  SCDI engine is equipped with a breakerless, single capacitor  discharge ignition unit with integrated generator. The ignition  unit is completely free of maintenance and needs no external  power supply. Two charging coils fitted on the generator  stator, independent from each other, each feed one ignition  circuit. The energy supplied is stored in the ignition capacitor.  At the moment of ignition, the external triggers supply an  impulse to the control circuits and the ignition capacitors  are discharged via the primary winding of the ignition coil.  The secondary winding supplies the high voltage for the  ignition spark.  

# Fuel System  

Due to higher lead content in aviation gas (AVGAS),  operation can cause wear and deposits in the combustion  chamber to increase. Therefore, AVGAS should only be used  if problems are encountered with vapor lock or if the other  fuel types are not available. Caution must be exercised to use  only fuel suitable for the relevant climatic conditions, such  as using winter fuel for summer operation.  

# Fuel-Oil Mixing Procedure  

The following describes the process for fuel-oil mixing. Use a  clean approved container of known volume. To help predilute the oil, pour a small amount of fuel into the container. Fill  known amount of oil (two-stroke oil ASTM/Coordinating  European Council (CEC) standards, API-TC classification  (e.g., Castrol TTS) mixing ratio 1:50 (2 percent)), into  container. Oil must be approved for air-cooled engines at  50:1 mixing ratio. Agitate slightly to dilute oil with gasoline.  Add gasoline to obtain desired mixture ratio; use fine mesh  screen. Replace the container cap and shake the container  thoroughly. Then, using a funnel with a fine mesh screen  to prevent the entry of water and foreign particles, transfer  mixture from container into the fuel tank.  

Warning:  To avoid electrostatic charging at refueling, use  only metal containers and ground the aircraft in accordance  with the grounding specifications.  

# Opposed Light-Sport, Experimental, &  Certificated Engines  

Many certificated engines are used with light-sport and  experimental aircraft. Generally, cost is a big factor when  considering this type of powerplant. The certificated engines  tend to be much more costly than the non-certificated engines,  and are not ASTM approved.  

# Rotax 912/914  

Figure 11-6  shows a typical four cylinder, four-stroke Rotax  horizontally opposed engine. The opposed-type engine has

two banks of cylinders directly opposite each other with a  crankshaft in the center. The pistons of both cylinder banks  are connected to the single crankshaft. The engine cylinder  heads are both liquid-cooled and air-cooled; the air-cooling  is mostly used on the cylinder. It is generally mounted with  the cylinders in a horizontal position. The opposed-type  engine has a low weight to horsepower ratio, and its narrow  silhouette makes it ideal for horizontal installation on the  aircraft wings (twin-engine applications). Another advantage  is its low vibration characteristics. It is an ideal replacement  for the Rotax 582 two-cylinder, two-stroke engine, which  powers many of the existing light aircraft, as it is the same  weight as the Rotax 582. These engines are ASTM approved  for installation into light-sport category aircraft, with some  models being FAA-certificated engines.  

# Description of Systems Cooling System  

The cooling system of the Rotax 914, shown in  Figure 11-7 ,  is designed for liquid cooling of the cylinder heads and  ram-air cooling of the cylinders. The cooling system of the  cylinder heads is a closed circuit with an expansion tank.  [Figure 11-8]  The coolant flow is forced by a water pump  driven from the camshaft, from the radiator, to the cylinder  heads. From the top of the cylinder heads, the coolant passes  on to the expansion tank (1). Since the standard location of  the radiator (2) is below engine level, the expansion tank  located on top of the engine allows for coolant expansion.  

The expansion tank is closed by a pressure cap (3) (with  excess pressure valve and return valve). As the temperature  of the coolant rises, the excess pressure valve opens and  the coolant flows via a hose at atmospheric pressure to the  transparent overflow bottle (4). When cooling down, the  coolant is sucked back into the cooling circuit. Coolant  temperatures are measured by means of temperature probes  installed in the cylinder heads 2 and 3. The readings are taken  on measuring the hottest point of cylinder head depending  on engine installation.  [Figure 11-7]  

# Fuel System  

The fuel flows from the tank (1) via a coarse filter-water trap 

 (2) to the two electric fuel pumps (3) connected in series. 

 [Figure 11-9]  From the pumps, fuel passes on via the fuel  pressure control (4) to the two carburetors (5). Parallel to  each fuel pump is a separate check valve (6) installed via  the return line (7) that allows surplus fuel to flow back to the  fuel tank. Inspection for possible constriction of diameter or

obstruction must be accomplished to avoid overflowing of  fuel from the carburetors. The return line must not have any  resistance to flow. The fuel pressure control ensures that the  fuel pressure is always maintained approximately 0.25 bar  (3.63 pounds per square inch (psi)) above the variable boost  pressure in the airbox and thus, ensures proper operation of  the carburetors.  

# Lubrication System  

The Rotax 914 engine is provided with a dry, sump-forced  lubrication system with a main oil pump with integrated  pressure regulator and an additional suction pump.  [Figure 11-10]  The oil pumps are driven by the camshaft.  The main oil pump draws oil from the oil tank (1) via the  oil cooler (2) and forces it through the oil filter to the points  of lubrication. It also lubricates the plain bearings of the  

![](images/f5d546ec0ad6cb2c658649e7fbeff3bb4828085a6670d4b8a882a79a2ba4cf59.jpg)

turbocharger and the propeller governor. The surplus oil  emerging from the points of lubrication accumulates on the  bottom of crankcase and is forced back to the oil tank by the  blow-by gases. The turbocharger is lubricated via a separate  oil line (from the main oil pump). The oil emerging from  the lower placed turbocharger collects in the oil sump by a  separate pump and is pumped back to the oil tank via the oil  line (3). The oil circuit is vented via bore (5) in the oil tank.  There is an oil temperature sensor in the oil pump flange for  reading of the oil inlet temperature.  

![](images/47091f9f468be4f4a248dbebe1f7b15a1d95ca245858e3dfd65b83d4f971e382.jpg)  
Figure 11-10.  Lubrication system.  

# Electric System  

The Rotax 914 engine is equipped with a dual ignition unit  that uses a breakerless, capacitor discharge design with an integrated generator.  [Figure 11-11]  The ignition unit is  completely free of maintenance and needs no external power  supply. Two independent charging coils (1) located on the  generator stator supply one ignition circuit each. The energy  is stored in capacitors of the electronic modules (2). At the  moment of ignition, two each of the four external trigger coils  (3) actuate the discharge of the capacitors via the primary  circuit of the dual ignition coils (4). The firing order is as  follows:  1-4-2-3. The fifth trigger coil (5) is used to provide  the revolution counter signal.  

# Turbocharger & Control System  

The Rotax 914 engine is equipped with an exhaust gas  turbocharger making use of the energy in the exhaust gas for  compression of the intake air or for providing boost pressure  to the induction system. The boost pressure in the induction  system (airbox) is controlled by means of an electronically  controlled valve (wastegate) in the exhaust gas turbine.  The wastegate regulates the speed of the turbocharger and  consequently the boost pressure in the induction system. The  required nominal boost pressure in the induction system is  determined by the throttle position sensor mounted on the  carburetor   $2/4$  . The sensor’s transmitted position is linear  from 0 to 115 percent, corresponding to a throttle position  from idle to full power.  [Figure 11-12]  For correlation  between throttle position and nominal boost pressure in the  induction, refer to  Figure 11-13.  As shown in the diagram,  with the throttle position at 108–110 percent results in a rapid  rise of nominal boost pressure.  

To avoid unstable boost, the throttle should be moved  smoothly through this area either to full power (115 percent)  or at a reduced power setting to maximum continuous  power. In this range (108–110 percent throttle position),  small changes in throttle position have a big effect on engine  performance and speed. These changes are not apparent to  the pilot from the throttle lever position. The exact setting for  a specific performance is virtually impossible in this range  and has to be prevented, as it might cause control fluctuations  or surging. Besides the throttle position, overspeeding of  the engine and too high intake air temperature have an  effect on the nominal boost pressure. If one of the stated  factors exceeds the specified limits, the boost pressure is  automatically reduced, thus protecting the engine against  over boost and detonation.  

The turbo control unit (TCU) is furnished with output  connections for an external red boost lamp and an orange  caution lamp for indications of the functioning of the TCU.  When switching on the voltage supply, the two lamps are  automatically subject to a function test. Both lamps illuminate  for one to two seconds, then they extinguish. If they do not,  a check per the engine maintenance manual is necessary. If  the orange caution lamp is not illuminated, then this signals  that TCU is ready for operation. If the lamp is blinking,  this indicates a malfunction of the TCU or its periphery  systems. Exceeding the admissible boost pressure activates

and illuminates the red boost lamp continuously. The TCU  registers the time of full throttle operation (boost pressure).  Full throttle operation for longer than 5 minutes, with the  red boost light illuminated, makes the red boost lamp start  blinking. The red boost lamp helps the pilot to avoid full  power operation for longer than 5 minutes or the engine could  be subject to thermal and mechanical overstress.

# HKS 700T Engine  

The HKS   $700\mathrm{T}$   engine is a four-stroke, two cylinder  turbocharged engine equipped with an intercooler.  [Figure 11-14]  The horizontally opposed cylinders house  four valves per cylinder, with a piston displacement of 709  cc. It uses an electronic control fuel injection system. A  reduction gearbox is used to drive the propeller flange at  a speed reduction ratio of 2.13 to 1. The engine is rated at  77 horsepower continuous and 80 horsepower takeoff (3  minutes) at   $4{,}900~\mathrm{rpm}$   and   ${5,300\ \mathrm{rpm}}$  , respectively. A total  engine weight of 126 pounds provides a good power to weight  ratio. The   $700\mathrm{T}$   has a TBO of 500 hours.  

# Jabiru Light-Sport Engines  

Jabiru engines are designed to be manufactured using  the latest manufacturing techniques. [ Figure 11-15 ] All  Jabiru engines are manufactured, assembled, and ran on a  Dynometer, then calibrated before delivery. The crankcase  halves, cylinder heads, crankshaft, starter motor housings,  gearbox cover (the gearbox powers the distributor rotors),  together with many smaller components are machined from  solid material. The sump (oil pan) is the only casting. The  cylinders are machined from bar 4140 chrome molybdenum  alloy steel, with the pistons running directly in the steel  bores. The crankshaft is also machined from 4140 chrome  molybdenum alloy steel, the journals of which are precision  ground prior to being Magnaflux inspected. The camshaft  is manufactured from 4140 chrome molybdenum alloy steel  with nitrided journals and cams.

Figure 11-15.   Jabiru engines.  

The propeller is direct crankshaft driven and does not use  a reduction gearbox. This facilitates its lightweight design  and keeps maintenance costs to a minimum. The crankshaft  features a removable propeller flange that enables the easy  replacement of the front crankshaft seal and provides for a  propeller shaft extension to be fitted, should this be required  for particular applications. Cylinder heads are machined from  a solid aluminum billet that is purchased directly from one  company, thereby providing a substantive quality control trail  to the material source. Connecting rods are machined from  4140 alloy steel and the 45 millimeters big end bearings are  of the automotive slipper type. The ignition coils are sourced  from outside suppliers and are modified by Jabiru for their  own particular application.  

An integral alternator provides AC rectification for battery  charging and electrical accessories. The alternator is attached  to the flywheel and is driven directly by the crankshaft. The  ignition system is a transistorized electronic system; two  fixed coils mounted adjacent to the flywheel are energized  by magnets attached to the flywheel. The passing of the  coils by the magnets creates the high voltage current, that is  transmitted by high tension leads to the center post of two  automotive type distributors, which are simply rotors and  caps, before distribution to automotive spark plugs (two in the  top of each cylinder head). The ignition system is fixed timing  and, therefore, removes the need for timing adjustment. It is  suppressed to prevent radio interference.  

The ignition system is fully redundant, self-generating, and  does not depend on battery power. The crankshaft is designed  with a double bearing at the propeller flange end and a main  bearing between each big end. Thrust bearings are located  fore and aft of the front double bearing, allowing either tractor  or pusher installation. Pistons are remachined to include a  piston pin, circlip, and groove. They are all fitted with three  rings, the top rings being cast iron to complement the chrome  molybdenum cylinder bores. Valves are  $7\mathrm{mm}$   (stem diameter)  and are manufactured specifically for the Jabiru engine. The  valve drive train includes pushrods from the camshaft from  the camshaft followers to valve rockers. The valves are  Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machined from steel  billet, induction hardened, polished on contact surfaces,  and mounted on a shaft through Teflon coated bronze-steel  bush. Valve guides are manufactured from aluminum/ bronze. Replaceable valve seats are of nickel steel and are  shrunk into the aluminum cylinder heads. The valve train is  lubricated from the oil gallery. Engines use hydraulic lifters  that automatically adjust valve clearance. An internal gear  pump is driven directly by the camshaft and provides engine  lubrication via an oil circuit that includes an automotive spin- on filter, oil cooler and built-in relief valve.  

The standard engines are supplied with two ram-air cooling  ducts, that have been developed by Jabiru to facilitate the  cooling of the engine by directing air from the propeller  to the critical areas of the engine, particularly the cylinder  heads and barrels. The use of these ducts remove the need  to design and manufacture baffles and the establishment of a  plenum chamber, which is the traditional method of cooling  air-cooled, aircraft engines. The fact that these baffles and  plenum chamber are not required also ensures a cleaner  engine installation, which in turn facilitates maintenance and  inspection of the engine and engine components.  

The engine is fitted with a 1.5 kilowatt starter motor that  is also manufactured by Jabiru and provides very effective  starting. The engine has very low vibration level; however,  it is also supported by four large rubber shock mounts  attached to the engine mounts at the rear of the engine.  The fuel induction system uses a pressure compensating  carburetor. Following the carburetor, the air-fuel mixture is  drawn through a swept plenum chamber bolted to the sump  casting, in which the mixture is warmed prior to entering  short induction tubes attached to the cylinder heads.  

An effective stainless steel exhaust and muffler system is  fitted as standard equipment ensuring very quiet operations.  For owners wanting to fit vacuum instruments to their  aircraft, the Jabiru engines are designed with a vacuum  pump drive direct mounted through a coupling on the rear  of the crankshaft.  

# Jabiru 2200 Aircraft Engine  

The Jabiru   ${2}{,}200~\mathrm{{cc}}$   aircraft engine is a four-cylinder, four- stroke horizontally opposed air-cooled engine. At 132 pounds   $(60\,\mathrm{kgs})$   installed weight, it is one of the lightest four-cylinder,  four-stroke aircraft engines. Small overall dimensions give it  a small frontal area width (23.46 in,  $596\:\mathrm{mm})$  ) that makes it  a good engine for tractor applications. The Jabiru engine is  designed for either tractor or pusher installation. The Jabiru  engine specifications are listed in  Figure 11-16 .  

The Jabiru 3300 (  $120\,\mathrm{hp}$  ) engine features  [Figure 11-17] :  

•	 4-stroke, •	 3,300 cc engine (200 cubic inches), •	 6-cylinder horizontally opposed, •	 1 central camshaft, •	 Fully machined aluminum alloy crankcase, •	 Overhead valves (OHV) - push rod operated, •	 Ram air-cooled, •	 Wet sump lubrication - 4 liter capacity,  

•	 Direct propeller drive, •	 Dual transistorized magneto ignition, •	 Integrated AC generator, •	 Electric starter, •	 Mechanical fuel pump, and •	 Naturally aspirated - 1 pressure compensation  carburetor.  

# Aeromax Aviation 100 (IFB) Aircraft Engine  

Aeromax Aviation produces a version of a 100 hp engine  called the Integral Front Bearing. The engine features a  special made integral front bearing.  [Figure 11-18]  The  engine uses an integral permanent magnet 35 amp alternator,  lightweight starter, and dual ignition. The compact alternator  and starter allow for a streamlined and aerodynamic cowl  which improves the fuel efficiency of an experimental  aircraft. The Aeromax aircraft engine is an opposed six- cylinder, air-cooled, and direct drive. Being a six-cylinder  engine, it has smooth operation. The Aeromax engines are  known for their heat dissipation qualities, provided the proper  amount of cooling air is provided.  

It features a crank extension supported by a massive integral  front bearing (IFB) and bearing housing. These engines start  out as a GM Corvair automobile core engine. These basic  core engines are disassembled and each component that is  reused is refurbished and remanufactured. The crankshaft in  the Areomax 100 IFB aircraft engine is thoroughly inspected,  including a magnaflux inspection. After ensuring the crank  is free of any defects, it is extended by mounting the crank  extension hub on its front. Then, the crank is ground true,  with all five bearings’ surfaces (four original and the new  extended crank’s front bearing), being true to each other  and perpendicular to the crank’s prop flange.  [Figure 11-19]  

All radiuses are smooth with no sharp corners where stress  could concentrate. Every crankshaft is nitrated, which is a  heat-chemical process that hardens the crank surfaces. The  crank reinforcement coupled with the IFB is required to  counter the additional dynamic and bending loads introduced  on the crank in an aircraft application. The engine case is  totally refurbished and checked for wear. Any studs or bolts  that show wear are replaced. The engine heads are machined  to proper specifications and all new valves, guides, and valve  train components are installed. A three-angle valve grind and  lapping ensure a good valve seal.  

Once the engine is assembled, it is installed on a test  stand, pre-lubricated, and inspected. The engine is, then,  run several times for a total of two hours. The engine is  carefully inspected after each run to ensure it is in excellent  

![](images/cb2cb349dc51f7658408e4a4288a4fa6cecb562db2345773838b4021af5a4585.jpg)  

operating condition. At the end of test running the engine,  the oil filter is removed and cut for inspection. Its internal  condition is recorded. This process is documented and  kept on file for each individual engine. Once the engine’s  proper performance is assured, it is removed and packaged  in a custom built crate for shipping. Each engine is shipped  with its engine service and operations manual. This manual  contains information pertaining to installation, break–in,  testing, tune-up, troubleshooting, repair, and inspection  procedures. The specifications for the Aeromax 100 engine  are outlined in  Figure 11-20 .  

# Direct Drive VW Engines  

# Revmaster R-2300 Engine  

The Revmaster R-2300 engine maintains Revmaster’s  systems and parts, including its RM-049 heads that feature  large fins and a hemispherical combustion chamber.  [Figure 11-21]  It maintains the earlier R-2200 engine’s top

horsepower (82) at   $2{,}950~\mathrm{rpm}$   continuous.  [Figure 11-22] Takeoff power is rated at 85 at   $3{,}350~\mathrm{rpm}$  . The additional  power comes from a bore of   $94\,\mathrm{mm}$   plus lengthening of the R-2200’s connecting rods, plus increasing the stroke from 78  to  $84~\mathrm{mm}$  . The longer stroke results in more displacement,  and longer connecting rods yield better vibration and power  characteristics. The lower cruise rpm allows the use of longer  propellers, and the higher peak horsepower can be felt in  shorter takeoffs and steeper climbs.  

The Revmaster’s four main bearing crankshaft runs on a 60  mm center main bearing, is forged from 4340 steel, and uses  

![](images/f8f0f5276b85cffdcdc4bfab5079645af09f4659f50155eff538fe2b577ec48a.jpg)

nitrided journals. Thrust is handled by the  $55\,\mathrm{mm}\,\#3$   bearing  at the propeller end of the crank. Fully utilizing its robust #4  main bearing, the Revmaster crank has built in oil-controlled propeller capability, a feature unique in this horsepower  range; non-wood props are usable with these engines.  

Moving from the crankcase and main bearings, the cylinders  are made by using centrifugally cast chilled iron. The pistons  are forged out of high quality aluminum alloy, machined and  balanced in a set of four. There are two sizes of pistons, 92  mm and   $94~\mathrm{mm}$  , designed to be compatible with a   $78~\mathrm{mm}$  to  $82\;\mathrm{mm}$   stroke crankshafts. The cylinder set also contains

piston rings, wrist pins, and locks. The direct-drive R-2300  uses a dual CDI ignition with eight coil spark to eight spark  plugs, dual 20-amp alternators, oil cooler, and its proprietary  Rev-Flo carburetor, while introducing the longer cylinders  that do not require spacers. The automotive-based bearings,  valves, valve springs, and piston rings (among others) make  rebuilds easy and inexpensive.

# Teledyne Continental 0-200 Engine  

The 0-200 Series engine has become a popular engine for  use in light-sport aircraft. The 0-200-A/B is a four-cylinder,  carbureted engine producing 100 brake hp and has a  crankshaft speed of   $2{,}750~\mathrm{rpm}$  .  [Figure 11-24]  The engine  has horizontally opposed air-cooled cylinders. The engine  cylinders have an overhead valve design with updraft intake  inlets and downdraft exhaust outlets mounted on the bottom  of the cylinder. The 0-200-A/B engines have a 201 cubic inch  displacement achieved by using a cylinder design with a 4.06- inch diameter bore and a 3.88-inch stroke. The dry weight of  the engine is 170.18 pounds without accessories. The weight  of the engine with installed accessories is approximately  215 pounds. Developed specifically for light aircraft, the  0-200-D engine has a dry weight with installed accessories  of approximately 199 pounds. The engine is provided with  four integral rear engine mounts. A crankcase breather port  is located on the 1-3 side of the crankcase forward of the  number 3 cylinder.

# General Maintenance Practices on Light- Sport Rotax Engines  

Some specific maintenance practices that differ from  conventional certificated engines is covered for background  and educational acquaintance purposes only. Always refer  to the current manufacturer’s information when performing  maintenance on any engine.  

Safety regulations must be adhered to ensure maintenance  personnel safety when performing maintenance and service  work on any engine installation. The following information  should be followed while performing maintenance.  

The ignition should be off and the ignition system grounded  with the battery disconnected. Secure the engine against  unintentional operation. During maintenance work that  requires ignition on and battery connected, secure the propeller  against unintentional turning by hand, and secure and observe  a propeller safety zone. This precautionary measure serves  to avoid any injuries in case of an unintentional start of the  engine, which can result in injuries or death. Remember, as  long as the ground-cable (plead) is not properly connected  to ground, the ignition is switched ON (hot).  

Prevent contamination, such as metal chips, foreign material,  and/or dirt, from entering the cooling, lubricating, and fuel  system during maintenance. Severe burns and scalds may  result if the engine is not allowed to cool down to outside  air temperature before starting any work. Before reusing  disassembled parts, clean with a suitable cleaning agent,  check, and refit per instructions. Before every re-assembly,  check for missing components. Only use adhesives,  lubricants, cleaning agents, and solvents listed for use in the  maintenance instructions. Observe the tightening torques for  screws and nuts; overtorque or too loose connection could  cause serious engine damage or failure.  

The following are some general maintenance practices that  provide for safety and good technique:  

•	 Work only in a non-smoking area and not close to  sparks or open flames. •	 Always use the specified tools.  •	 During disassembling/reassembling the removal of  any safety items (e.g., safety wiring, self-locking  fastener) each part must be followed with the  replacement of a new one.  •	 Once loosened, always replace self-securing (locking)  nuts.  •	 Use clean screws and nuts only and inspect face of  nuts and thread for damage.  •	 Check the contact faces and threads for damage and  

replace if any damaged is detected.  •	 At reassembly of the engine, replace all sealing rings,  gaskets, securing elements, O-rings, and oil seals. •	 At disassembly of the engine, mark the engine’s  components as necessary to provide for locating the  original position of the part. •	 Parts should be replaced in the same position upon  reassembly. •	 Any used components have wear patterns that should  be replaced or matched if reused. Ensure that these  marks are not erased or washed off.  

To perform maintenance, the technician must follow the  manufacturer’s instructions. Obtain, read, and understand  the information pertaining to servicing of the light-sport or  experimental engine.  

# Maintenance Schedule Procedures &  Maintenance Checklist  

All stated checks are visual inspections for damage and  wear, unless otherwise stated. All listed work must be carried  out within the specified period. For the intervals between  maintenance work, a tolerance of  $^{\cdot+}$   or – 0 hour is permissible,  but these tolerances must not be exceeded. This means that  if a 100 hour check is actually carried out at 110 hour, the  next check is due at  $200\;\mathrm{hour}+\mathrm{or}-10$   hour and not at 210   $\mathrm{out}+\mathrm{or}-10$   hour. If maintenance is performed before the  prescribed interval, the next maintenance check is to be done  at the same interval (e.g., if first 100-hour check is done  after 87 hours of operation, the next 100-hour check must  be carried out after 187 hours of operation).  

Checks are carried out per the maintenance checklists,  where type and volume of maintenance work is outlined in  key words. The lists must be photocopied and filled out for  each maintenance check. The respective check (e.g., 100- hour check) must be noted on the top of each page of the  maintenance checklist. All the maintenance work carried  out must be initialed in the signature area by the aircraft  mechanic performing the task. After maintenance, the  completed checklists must be entered in the maintenance  records. The maintenance must be confirmed in the log book.  All discrepancies and remedial action must be recorded in  a report of findings to be generated and maintained by the  company authorized to carry out maintenance work. It is the  responsibility of the aircraft operator to store and keep the  records. Replacement of equipment (e.g., carburetor, fuel  pump, governor) and execution of Service Bulletins must be  entered in the log book, stating required information.  

# Carburetor Synchronization  

For smooth idling, synchronization of the throttle valves is  necessary. When synchronizing, slacken both Bowden cables,  and detach the resonator hose (3) of the compensating tube  (2) to separate the two air intake systems.  [Figure 11-26]  In  this condition, no significant difference in the engine running  should be noticeable. If adjustment is needed for synchronous  basic throttle adjustments (mechanical synchronization),  proceed as follows.  [Figures 11-27  and  11-28]  

Adjust the two Bowden cables for simultaneous opening  of the throttle valves. Remove the cable fixation (4) on the  throttle lever (1). Next, release the return spring (5) from its  attachment on the throttle lever (1), and return the throttle  lever (1) to its idle stop position (3) by hand. There should be  no resistance during this procedure. Unscrew the idle speed  adjustment screw (2) until it is free of the stop. Insert a 0.1  mm (0.004 in) feeler gauge (gap X) between the idle speed  adjustment screw (2) and the carburetor idle stop (3), then  gently turn the idle screw clockwise until contact is made  with the   $0.1\;\mathrm{mm}$   (0.004 in) feeler gauge. Pull out the feeler  gauge and turn each idle speed adjustment screw (2) 1.5 turns   in clockwise direction. Gently turn each idle mixture screw  (6) clockwise until it is fully inserted and, then, open by  $1\%$    turns counterclockwise. Hook the return spring (5) back up  to the throttle lever (1) in its original position. Check that the  throttle valve opens fully, automatically. Carry out the above  procedure on both carburetors.  

Note:  The mechanical carburetor synchronization is  sufficiently exact.  

At this point, place the throttle lever in the flight deck to  the idle stop position. Ensure that the throttle lever remains  in this position during the next steps of the synchronization  process. With the throttle lever in the idle stop position, move  

![](images/57439d08bba1d49fee99f3ea0965437d0c19c43f3aa858682c7b6c5c0e42f9ff.jpg)

the throttle lever (1) to the carburetor idle stop position,  using the cable fixation (4), and secure the Bowden cable  accordingly. As soon as the two carburetor Bowden cables  are installed (throttle lever idle position), check that the idle  speed adjustment screw (2) rests fully on the idle stop (3)  without pressure.  

Caution:  An idle speed that is too low results in gearbox  damage, and if an idle speed is too high, the engine is harder  to start. Start the engine and verify the idle speed. If the idle  speed is too high or too low, adjust accordingly with idle speed  adjustment screw (2). Check the operational idle mixture of  the engine. If necessary, adjust with the idle mixture screw (6).  

# Pneumatic Synchronization  

Mechanical synchronization should have already been  accomplished. The two carburetors are adjusted to equal  flow rate at idling by use of a suitable flow meter or vacuum  gauges (1).  

There are two possible methods to connect test equipment.  One option is to remove the hex screw (6)   $\mathrm{~M6~x~6~}$   from  the intake manifold (7) and connect the vacuum gauge(s).  [Figure 11-26  and  Figure 11- 29]  Remove the compensating  tube (2) with attached hoses (12) (connection between intake  manifolds) and plug the connections in the intake manifolds.  The other hook up option is to remove the compensating tube  hose (2) from the push-on connection (5) after removing the  tension clamp (4). Using the push-on connection (5), install  a flexible rubber hose (8) leading to the vacuum gauge (1),  using the balance tube (4). Install the other flexible rubber  hose leading to the vacuum gauge.  [Figure 11-29]  Before  proceeding any further, secure the aircraft on the ground  using wheel chocks and ropes.  

Warning:  Secure and observe the propeller zone during  engine operation.  

Start the engine, verify the idle speed, and make any  necessary corrections. If a setting correction of more than  $\%$  turn is required, repeat mechanical synchronization to prevent  too high a load on the idle stops. If the idle speed is too high,  the maximum the idle screw can be unscrewed is a complete  turn. If no satisfactory result can be achieved, inspect the idle  jets for contamination and clean if necessary.  

Caution:  Also check for translucent, jelly-like contamination.  Inspect for free flow.  

Once the proper idling speed has been established, it is  necessary to check the operating range above the idle speed.  First, establish that the engine is developing full takeoff  performance or takeoff rpm when selected in the flight deck.  Then, the setting of the operating range (idle to full throttle)  can be checked or adjusted.  

Start and warm up engine as per the operator’s manual.

Figure 11-29.   Gauges attached to the engine.  

Select full power and check that both pressure gauges are  registering the same readings. If the same reading is not  made on both gauges, shut down the engine and check  that carburetor actuation has full travel and that the chokes  are in the full off-position. If necessary, fit/modify the  carburetor actuation as required to achieve full power on  both carburetors. Once full power has been established  on both carburetors, retard the throttle and observe the  pressure gauge settings. The pressure gauges should show  the same reading for both carburetors. Discrepancies must  be compensated for by adjusting the off idle adjustment (7).  [Figure 11-27]  The carburetor with the lower indication  must be advanced to match the higher one. This is done by  shutting down the engine and loosening the locknut on the  Bowden cable and screwing the off idle adjustment in by  $\%$  turn, then tightening the locknut and retesting the engine.  Final idle speed adjustment may be required by resetting  the idle speed adjustment screws (2).  [Figure 11-27]  Equal  adjustment must be made on both carburetors.  

Any major adjustments require retesting to verify all  parameters mentioned in this procedure are within limits.  Install compensation tube assembly on the engine in reverse  sequence of removal. Any minor differences in balance at idle  speed is compensated for. Always follow the instructions of  the instrument manufacturer.  

# Idle Speed Adjustment  

If satisfactory idle speed adjustment cannot be achieved,  inspection of the idle jet or additional pneumatic  synchronization is necessary. Always carry out idle speed  adjustment when the engine is warm. Basic adjustment of  the idle speed is first accomplished by using the idle speed  adjustment screw (2) of the throttle valve.  [Figure 11-27]  

# Optimizing Engine Running  

Optimizing the engine run is necessary only if not  accomplished at carburetor synchronization. Close the idle  mixture screw (6) by turning clockwise to screw in fully  and, then, opening again by   $1\%$   turns counterclockwise.  [Figures 11-27  and  11-28]  Starting from this basic adjustment,  the idle mixture screw (6) is turned until the highest motor  speed is reached. The optimum setting is the middle  between the two positions, at which an rpm drop is noticed.  Readjustment of the idle speed is carried out using the idle  speed adjustment screw (2) and, if necessary, by slightly  turning the idle mixture screw again. Turning the idle mixture  control screw in a clockwise direction results in a leaner  mixture and turning counterclockwise in a richer mixture.  

# Checking the Carburetor Actuation  

The Bowden cables should be routed in such a way that  carburetor actuation is not influenced by any movement of  the engine or airframe, thus possibly falsifying idle speed  setting and synchronization.  [Figure 11-30]  Each carburetor  is actuated by two Bowden cables. At position 1, connection  for throttle valve and at position 2, make the connection for  the choke actuator. The Bowden cables must be adjusted so  that the throttle valve and the choke actuation of the starting  carburetor can be fully opened and closed. Bowden cables  and lever must operate freely and not jam.  

Warning:  With carburetor actuation not connected, the  throttle valve is fully open. The initial position of the  carburetor is full throttle. Never start the engine with the  actuation disconnected. Inspect Bowden cables and levers  for free movement. Cables must allow for full travel of lever from stop to stop. Adjust throttle cables to a clearance of 1  mm (0.04 in). Inspect and lubricate linkage on carburetor  and carburetor joints with engine oil. Inspect return springs  (3) and engagement holes for wear.  

# Lubrication System  

# Oil Level Check  

Always allow engine to cool down to ambient temperature  before starting any work on the lubrication system. Severe  burns and scalds may result from hot oil coming into contact  with the skin. Switch off ignition and remove ignition key. To  assure that the engine does not turn by the starter, disconnect  the negative terminal of aircraft battery. Before checking  the oil level, make sure that there is not excess residue oil  in the crankcase. Prior to oil level check, turn the propeller  

![](images/3c7519d6e976585d3022350448ea29c7ab33b6a31e29232ea4f2d31123f9a9c0.jpg)

several times by hand in the direction of engine rotation to  pump all the oil from the engine to the oil tank. This process  is completed when air flows back to the oil tank. This air  flow can be perceived as a gurgling noise when the cap of  the oil tank is removed. The oil level in the oil tank should  be between the two marks (maximum/minimum) on the  oil dipstick, but must never fall below the minimum mark.  [Figure 11-31]  Replenish oil as required, but for longer  flights, replenish oil to maximum mark to provide for more  of an oil reserve. During standard engine operation, the  oil level should be mid-way between the maximum and  minimum marks a higher oil level (over servicing). Oil can  escape through the venting (breather) passage.  

# Oil Change  

It is advisable to check the oil level prior to an oil change, as  it provides information about oil consumption. Run engine  to warm the oil before beginning the procedure. Taking  proper precautions, crank the engine by hand to transfer the  oil from the crankcase. Remove the safety wire and oil drain  screw (1) from the oil tank, drain the used oil, and dispose  of as per environmental regulations.  [Figure 11-32]  Remove  and replace oil filter at each oil change. It is not necessary  to remove oil lines and other oil connections. Draining the  suction lines, oil cooler, and return line is not necessary  and must be avoided, as it results in air entering the oil  system. Replacement of the oil filter and the oil change  should be accomplished quickly and without interruption  to prevent a draining of the oil system and the hydraulic  tappets. Compressed air must not be used to blow through  

![](images/148df629b57438813e8ce7ae887b7583c664832bd6ad81ae06954218a73c49f2.jpg)

the oil system (or oil lines, oil pump housing, oil bores in  the housing). Replace the oil drain screw torque and safety  wire. Only use the appropriate oil in accordance with the  latest operator’s manual and service instruction. The engine  must not be cranked when the oil system is open. After the  oil change is accomplished, the engine should be cranked by  hand in the direction of engine rotation (approximately 20  turns) to completely refill the entire oil circuit.  

# Cleaning the Oil Tank  

Cleaning the oil is optional and requires venting of the oil  system. It is only necessary to clean the oil tank and the inner  parts if there is heavy oil contamination. The procedure for  cleaning the oil tank is shown in  Figure 11-32.  Detach the  profile clamp (2) and remove the oil tank cover (3), together  with the O-ring (4) and the oil lines. Remove the inner parts of  the oil tank, such as the baffle insert (5) and the partition (6).  Clean oil tank (8) and inner parts  $(5,6)$  , and check for damage.  Be aware that incorrect assembly of the oil tank components  can cause engine faults or engine damage. Replace the drain  screw with a new sealing ring (7) and tighten to 25 Newton  meters   $(\mathrm{Nm})$     $.18.5\,\mathrm{ft}/1\mathrm{b})$   and safety wire. Reassemble the oil  tank by following the same steps in reverse order.  

# Inspecting the Magnetic Plug  

Remove the magnetic plug and inspect it for accumulation  of chips.  [Figure 11-33]  The magnetic plug (torx screw) is  located on the crankcase between cylinder 2 and the gearbox.  This inspection is important because it allows conclusions  to be drawn on the internal condition of the gearbox and  engine, and reveals information about possible damage. If  a significant amount of metal chips are detected, the engine  must be inspected, repaired, or overhauled. Steel chips in low  numbers can be tolerated if the accumulation is below  $3\,\mathrm{mm}$  (0.125 in).  [Figure 11-33]  In the case of unclear findings,  flush the oil circuit and fit a new oil filter. Afterwards, conduct  an engine test run and inspect the oil filter once more. If there  are larger accumulations of metal chips on the magnetic plug,  the engine must be repaired or overhauled in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for continued airworthiness.  A detailed inspection of affected engine components must  be performed. If the oil circuit is contaminated, replace the  oil cooler and flush the oil circuit, then trace the cause and  remedy the situation. If the magnetic chip is found to have no  metal, then clean and reinstall. Tighten the plug to a torque  of   $25~\mathrm{Nm}$   (18.5 ft/lb). Safety wire the plug and inspect all  systems for correct function.  

# Checking the Propeller Gearbox  

The following free rotation check and friction torque check  are necessary only on certificated engines and on engines with  the overload clutch as an optional extra. Engines without the  overload clutch (slipper clutch) still incorporate the torsional  shock absorption. This design is similar to the system with  overload clutch, but without free rotation. For this reason, the  friction torque method cannot be applied on engines without  the overload clutch.  

# Checking the Friction Torque in Free Rotation  

Fit the crankshaft with a locking pin.  [Figure 11-34]  With  the crankshaft locked, the propeller can be turned by hand  15 or 30 degrees, depending on the profile of the dog gears  installed. This is the maximum amount of movement allowed  

![](images/5fb9cab4b4d07ed52b6ec7f8ee87c3caeaa80ce8b6d95c1a53d8a4098879ddb3.jpg)

by the dog gears in the torsional shock absorption unit.  

Warning:  Ignition OFF and system grounded. Disconnect  negative terminal of aircraft battery.  

Turn the propeller by hand back and forth between ramps,  taking into consideration the friction torque. No odd noises or  irregular resistance must be noticeable during this movement.  Attach a calibrated spring scale to the propeller at a certain  distance (L) from the center of the propeller. Measure the  force required to pull the propeller through the 15 or 30  degree range of free rotation. Calculate friction torque Nm by  multiplying the force Newton’s (N) or pounds (lb) obtained  on the spring scale by the distance the scale is attached from  the center of the propeller (L). The distance measurement and  torque measurement must be in the same units either standard  or metric and cannot be mixed up. The friction torque must  be between a minimum of  $25\;\mathrm{Nm}$   and maximum of   $60\;\mathrm{{Nm}}$  (18.5 to 44.3 ft/lb). A calculation example is as follows:  

![](images/b8e179ab4b8dedce24ecf92d2019b602c379c864056ab489867a5fb10ca81cd8.jpg)  

Remove crankshaft locking pin and reinstall plug with new  gasket. Reconnect negative terminal of aircraft battery.  If the above mentioned friction torque is not achieved,  inspect, repair, or overhaul the gearbox in accordance with  the manufacturer’s instructions for continued airworthiness.  Testing the propeller flange is not normal maintenance but  can be carried out if defects or cracks are suspected.  

# Daily Maintenance Checks  

The following checklist should be used for daily maintenance  checks. Repair, as necessary, all discrepancies before flight.  

1.	 Verify ignition OFF.  

2.	 Drain water from fuel tank sump and/or water trap  (if fitted). 3.	 Inspect carburetor rubber socket or flange for cracks  and verify secure attachment. 4.

Check propeller shaft bearing for clearance by rocking  propeller.  21.	 Inspect throttle choke and oil pump lever cables for  damage (end fittings, outer casing, and kinks).  

# Pre-flight Checks  

The following checklist should be performed for all pre- flight checks. Repair, as necessary, all discrepancies and  shortcoming before flight.  

1.	 Verify ignition OFF.  2.	 Check fuel content. 3.	 Inspect for coolant leaks. 4.	 Verify oil tank content (oil injection engines). 5.	 Verify spark plug connectors for security. 6.	 Inspect engine and gearbox for oil leaks. 7.	 Inspect engine and gearbox for loose or missing nuts,  bolts, and screws, and verify security of gearbox to  engine mounting. 8.	 Inspect propeller for splits and chips. If any damage,  repair and/or rebalance before use. 9.	 Verify security of propeller mounting. 10.	 Check throttle, oil injection pump, and choke actuation  for free and full movement. 11.	 Verify that cooling fan turns when engine is rotated  (air-cooled engines). 12.

Start engine after assuring that area is clear of  bystanders. 14.	 Single ignition engines: check operation of ignition  switch (flick ignition off and on again at idling). 15.	 Dual ignition engines: check operation of both  ignition circuits. 16.	 Check operation of all engine instruments during  warm up. 17.	 If possible, visually check engine and exhaust for  excessive vibration during warm up (indicates  propeller out of balance). 18.	 Verify that engine reaches full power rpm during  takeoff roll.  

# Troubleshooting & Abnormal Operation  

The information in this section is for training purposes  and should never be used for maintenance on the actual  aircraft. Only qualified personnel (experienced two-stroke  technicians) trained on this particular type of engine are  allowed to carry out maintenance and repair work. If  the following information regarding the remedy of the  malfunction does not solve the malfunction, contact an  authorized facility. The engine must not be returned to service  until the malfunction is rectified. As described earlier in the  text, engines require basically two essentials to run: spark  and correct air-fuel mixture. The majority of problems quite  often are a simple lack of one or the other.  

# Troubleshooting  

Follow an organized method of troubleshooting. This  facilitates the identification of discrepancies or malfunctions.  

•	 Fuel—start by checking the supply (tank), fittings  (loose), filter (plugged), and float chamber (fouled). •	 Spark—check for spark at the spark plugs.  

Problems of a more complex nature are best left to an engine  technician. The following are examples of engine troubles  and potential fixes.  

# Engine Keeps Running With Ignition OFF  

Possible cause: Overheating of engine.  Remedy: Let engine cool down at idling at approximately  2,000 engine rpm.  

# Knocking Under Load  

Possible cause: Octane rating of fuel too low.  Remedy: Use fuel with higher octane rating. Possible cause: Fuel starvation, lean mixture. Remedy: Check fuel supply.  

# Abnormal Operation  

# Exceeding the Maximum Admissible Engine Speed  

Reduce engine speed. Any overage of the maximum  admissible engine speed must be entered by the pilot into the  logbook, stating duration and extent of over-speed.  

# Exceeding Maximum Admissible Cylinder Head  Temperature  

Reduce engine power, setting to the minimum necessary,  and carry out precautionary landing. Any exceeding of the  maximum admissible cylinder head temperature must be  entered by the pilot into the logbook, stating duration and  extent of excess-temperature condition.  

# Exceeding Maximum Admissible Exhaust Gas  Temperature  

Reduce engine power, setting to the minimum necessary,  and carry out precautionary landing. Any exceedence of  the maximum admissible exhaust gas temperature must be  entered by the pilot into the logbook, stating duration and  extent of excess-temperature condition.  

# Engine Preservation  

If the engine is not going to be used for an extended period  of time, certain measures must be taken to protect engine  against heat, direct sun light, corrosion, and formation of  residues. In particular, the water bonded by the alcohol in  the fuel causes increased corrosion problems during storage.  

After each flight, activate choke for a moment before stopping  engine. Close all engine openings like exhaust pipe, venting  tube, and air filter to prevent entry of contamination and  humidity. For engine storage of one to four weeks, proceed  with preservation prior to engine stop or on the engine at  operating temperature. Let the engine run at increased idle  speed. Shut the engine down and secure against inadvertent  engine start. Remove air filters and inject approximately  3 cubic cm of preservation oil or equivalent oil into the  air intake of each carburetor. Restart the engine and run at  increased idle speed for 10–15 seconds. Shut engine down  and secure against inadvertent engine start. Close all engine  openings, such as exhaust pipe, venting tube, and air filter,  to prevent entry of contamination and humidity.  

For engine storage of engine for longer than four weeks and  up to one year, proceed with preservation prior to engine stop  and on the engine at operating temperature. Let the engine  run at increased idle speed. Remove air filters and inject  approximately 6 cubic cm of preservative oil or equivalent  oil into the air intake of each carburetor. Stop the engine.  Remove spark plugs and inject approximately 6 cubic cm  preservation oil or equivalent oil into each cylinder and  slowly turn crankshaft 2 to 3 turns by hand to lubricate top  end parts. Replace and re-torque the spark plugs. Drain  gasoline from float chambers, fuel tank, and fuel lines. Drain  coolant on liquid cooled engines to prevent any damage by  freezing. Lubricate all carburetor linkages using the proper  lubricates. Close all openings of the engine, such as exhaust  pipe openings, venting tube, and air intake, to prevent entry  of any foreign material and humidity. Protect all external  steel parts by spraying with engine oil.  

# General Maintenance Practices for the Light- Sport Jabiru Engines  

Note:  Some specific maintenance practices that differ from  conventional certificated engines is covered for background  and educational acquaintance purposes only. Always refer  to the current manufacturer’s information when performing  maintenance on any engine.  

# Engine & Engine Compartment Inspection  

Check for oil, fuel exhaust, and induction leaks and clean  the entire engine and compartment before inspection. Check  flywheel screw tensions to 24 foot pounds. Check the  carburetor air filter and clean it by removing it from the intake  housing and blowing compressed air against the direction of  the intake flow. For operation in heavy dust conditions, clean  air filter at shorter intervals than recommended for normal  conditions. A clogged filter reduces engine performance,  as well as promotes premature engine wear. The engine  baffles and air ducts should be checked for condition and  functionality.  

Two methods can be used to check the cylinders compression.  The compression gauge method is used to measure  compression using a compression tracer. Readings are taken  with a fully open throttle valve at engine oil temperature  between  $30~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   and   $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   (  $90\,\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   to   $160\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  ). If readings are  below 6 bar (90 psi) a check of the pistons, cylinders, valves,  and cylinder heads must be undertaken.  

The second method uses the pressure differential test. Check  cylinder compression for a maximum allowable pressure  loss of 25 percent. As an alternative to a compression test, a  pressure differential test (leak down) can be accomplished.  This is a much better test of the condition of rings, bore, head  sealing, and valves. This is the normal test used in aviation  and requires specific equipment. The test is carried out with  the engine in warm to hot condition. Input pressure is best  set at   $80\,\mathrm{psi}$  ; a second gauge reads the differential. This is  done with the piston on TDC on the firing stroke.  

Note:  The propeller needs to be restrained. A differential  of lower than 80/60 (generally a 25 percent loss) indicates  a problem.  

Problems can be better identified by observing where air is  escaping from the cylinder, blow-by. Some examples are as  follows:  

1. 	 Blow-by through the crankcase vent indicates worn  rings or bore. 2. 	 Leaking from carburetor indicates a poor intake valve  seal. 3. 	 Leaking from exhaust indicates a poor exhaust valve  seal. 4. 	 Head leak indicates poor head to cylinder seal.  

With the problem identified, the malfunction can then  be corrected. Poor compression can be an indication of a  serious problem. For example, continued operation with  poor compression due to a poorly sealing valve can lead  to eventual valve failure and heavy damage to the piston,  connecting-rod, barrel, and head.  

# Lubrication System  

The oil should be changed as required by the manufacturer.  When changed, the oil filter should also be changed. Change  the oil filter at every 50 hourly inspection. Drain the oil while  engine is still warm and visually check for leaks. Fill the  engine with oil (approximately 2.3 liters) and check oil level.  Never exceed the maximum mark. Use only registered brand  oils meeting the correct specifications. Do not drain the oil  cooler during a normal oil change. The cooler holds only a  small amount of old oil that has negligible effect on the new  oil. Taking the hoses on and off the cooler can prematurely  

# Carburetor Adjustment & Checks  

To adjust the engine’s idle speed, adjust the idle stop screw  (  $7~\mathrm{mm}$   screw) against throttle lever. Standard idle mixture  screw position is  $1\%$   turns out from the seated position. Fine  adjustment may be necessary to give a smooth idle.  

The mixture is set by selecting jet sizes. As supplied, the  engine has jets to suit a majority of installations; however,  the mixture may be affected by operation with a propeller  that does not meet the requirements listed in the installation  manual or by ambient temperature extremes. If an engine is  to be used in these situations, an exhaust gas temperature  (EGT) gauge should be fitted and monitored against the  limits specified above. Do not change carburetor settings if  EGT readings fall outside the range given without consulting  with Jabiru Aircraft or the local authorized representative.  The carburetor automatically adjusts the mixture to account  for altitude. Visual inspection should include checks for  carburetor joint degradation and carburetor linkage for full  and free movement, correct positioning of stops and security.  

# Spark Plugs  

When plugs are removed from a warm engine, the inspection  of the tip of the spark plug can be used to indicate the health  of the engine. If the tip of the plug is a light brown color,  the plug is operating correctly. A black velvet, sooty looking  plug tip generally is an indication of an overly rich mixture  (check the choke, air filter, and intake). If the firing end tip  is covered with oil, it is an indication of too much oil in  the combustion chamber (check for worn piston rings and  cylinder walls). When servicing the spark plugs, do not  use steel or brass brushes for cleaning, and never sandblast  plugs. Clean the spark plugs with a plastic brush in a solvent.  Check electrode gap and, if necessary, adjust to  $0.55{-}0.6\mathrm{mm}$   $(0.022\ \mathrm{in}–0.024\ \mathrm{in})$  ) by carefully bending the electrode. Use  the recommended Plugs (NGK D9EA) and place a suitable  anti-seize compound on threads of the plug before installing  them in the engine. Tighten spark plugs when the engine is  cold  and adjust engine to the correct torque value. Reconnect  the ignition lead.  

# Exhaust System  

Visually check the exhaust system for security of mounting,  damage, rubbing, leaks, and general condition. Check nuts  and bolts for tightness and condition; re-torque and replace  if necessary.  

# Head Bolts  

Check the head bolt torque after five hours of operation, and  again after ten hours of operation. The bolts should, thereafter,  be checked annually. Head bolts torque when cold to 20 ft/lb.  

# Tachometer & Sender  

Many apparent engine problems can be caused through  inaccurate tachometers. Where engine performance is  observed to be outside limits, the tachometer should be  checked against a calibrated instrument. Tachometer sender  gap is   $0.4\mathrm{mm}$   (0.016 inches). The sender must have at least  60 percent covered by the tags fitted to the gearbox side of  the flywheel. Ensure both tags are equal distance from sender.  

# Engine Inspection Charts  

Note:  Read all inspection requirement paragraphs prior to  using these charts.  [Figure 11-35]  

![Figure 11-35.   Engine inspection charts. ](images/6a1d24ff6053190c4ddc5eccab50b6a151e93e8c7f431b88a4c686b559f048e2.jpg)  

# A  

Abradable strip.  A strip of material in the compressor  housing of some axial-flow gas turbine engines. The tip of  the compressor blade touches the abradable strip, and wears,  or abrades a groove in it. This groove ensures the minimum  tip clearance.  

Abradable tip (compressor blade tip).  The tip of some  axial-flow compressor blades constructed so that it will  abrade, or wear away, upon contact with the compressor  housing, which ensures the minimum tip clearance between  the blade and the housing.  

Absolute pressure.  Pressure referenced from zero pressure  or a vacuum.  

AC.  Alternating current. Electrical current in which  the electrons continually change their rate of flow and  periodically reverse their direction.  

ACC.  Active clearance control. A system for controlling the  clearance between tips of the compressor and turbine blades  and the case of high-performance turbofan engines. When  the engine is operating at maximum power, the blade tip  clearance should be minimum, and the ACC system sprays  cool fan discharge air over the outside of the engine case. This  causes the case to shrink enough to decrease the tip clearance.  For flight conditions that do not require such close clearance,  the cooling air is turned off, and the case expands to its normal  dimensions. The control of the ACC system is done by the  FADEC, or full-authority digital electronic control.  

Acceleration.  The amount the velocity of an object is  increased by a force during each second it is acted upon by  that force. Acceleration is usually measured and expressed  in terms of feet per second, per second (fps²).  

Accessory end.  The end of a reciprocating engine on which  many of the accessories are mounted. Also, called the anti- propeller end.  

Accumulator.  A hydraulic component that stores a  non-compressible fluid, such as oil, under pressure. An  accumulator has two compartments separated by a flexible  or movable partition with one compartment containing  compressed air. When oil is pumped into the other  compartment, the partition moves over, further compressing  the air which holds pressure on the oil.  

AD (ashless dispersant) oil.  A mineral-based lubricating oil  used in reciprocating engines. This oil does not contain any  metallic ash-forming additives, but has additives that disperse  the contaminants and hold them in suspension until they can  be removed by filters.  

ADC.  Air data computer. An electronic computer in an  aircraft that senses pitot pressure, static pressure, and total air  temperature. It produces an indication of altitude, indicated  airspeed, true airspeed, and Mach number. The output of ADC  is usable by any of the engine or flight control computers.  

ADI (antidetonation injection) system.  A system used with  some large reciprocating engines in which a mixture of water  and alcohol is sprayed into the engine with the fuel when  operating at extremely high power. The air/fuel mixture is  leaned to allow the engine to develop its maximum power,  and the ADI fluid absorbs excessive heat when it vaporizes.  

Adiabatic change.  A physical change that takes place within  a material in which heat energy is neither added to the  material, nor taken away. If a container of gas is compressed,  with no heat energy added to or taken from it, the gas will  become hotter; its temperature will rise.  

Aeromatic propeller.  A patented variable-pitch propeller  that has flyweights around the blade shanks and the  blades angled back from the hub to increase the effects of  aerodynamic and centrifugal twisting forces. This propeller  automatically maintains a relatively constant rpm for any  throttle setting.  

Aft-fan engine.  A turbofan engine with the fan mounted  behind the compressor section. The blades of an aft-fan are  normally extensions of the free turbine blades.  

Afterburner.  A component in the exhaust system of a  turbojet or turbofan engine used to increase the thrust for  takeoff and for special flight conditions. Since much of the air  passing through a gas turbine engine is used only for cooling,  it still contains a great deal of oxygen. Fuel is sprayed into  the hot, oxygen-rich exhaust in the afterburner, where it is  ignited and burned to produce additional thrust.  

Air bleed (carburetor component).  A small hole in the fuel  passage between the float bowl and the discharge nozzle of  a float carburetor. Air drawn into the liquid fuel through the  air bleed breaks the fuel up into an emulsion, making it easy  to atomize and vaporize.  

Air cooling.  The removal of unwanted heat from an aircraft  engine by transferring the heat directly into the air flowing  over the engine components.  

Air/fuel mixture ratio.  The ratio of the weight of the air  to that of the fuel in the mixture fed into the cylinders of  an engine.

The iron oxide is normally treated with a  fluorescent dye, and the inspection is conducted in a darkened  booth. When an ultraviolet light (black light) is shone on the  part, the treated iron oxide shows up as a brilliant line.
