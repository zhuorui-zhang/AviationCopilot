# FEDERAL AVIATION GUIDELINES  

All the drugs mentioned in this brochure are  unacceptable in the aviation environment. It is a  violation under the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR;  14 CFR 61.53) to operate aircraft while using impairing  medications. Should a pilot take one of these medications  for any reason, the underlying medical condition will  always need assessment to obtain medical certification. If  the medical condition is acceptable for certification, the  use of medication then becomes the issue. Continued  or intermittent use of opioid medication is problematic,  and an individualized assessment is necessary. However,  if the opioid is used on a short-term basis or is no longer  needed, the question is “When can the pilot return to  flying duties?”  

Due to dosage and individual differences, return to  duty time can vary. Although there are exceptions, the  FAA recommends, as a general rule, 5 drug half-lives  or 5 maximal dosing intervals. A pilot who has taken  hydrocodone/acetaminophen for an acute pain issue  should wait approximately 20 to 30 hours since the drug  can be taken every 4 to 6 hours.  

According to the FAA’s qualification standard found  in 14 CFR Part 67, a pilot need only have one of the  following to be considered dependent on a substance:  

•	 Increased tolerance •	 Manifestation of withdrawal symptoms •	 Impaired control of use •	 Continued use despite damage to physical health 
 	 or impairment of social, personal or occupational 
 	 function  

In 2018, the Department of Transportation expanded  the federal drug testing panel to include opioids. The  federal drug testing applies to pilots that perform flight

crewmember duties for a domestic commercial air carrier  or operator.  

When a federal test is confirmed positive by a laboratory  for opioids, the donor has an opportunity to provide a  medical explanation for the drugs being in their system  to the Medical Review Officer (MRO). The donor may  provide evidence of a valid prescription; however, the  MRO makes the determination that the medication is  valid and taken for the prescribed condition. If the MRO  determines the explanation is valid, the test result is verified  negative. The MRO is obligated to report a donor’s medical  information to the employer when they believe the use of a  medication could pose a significant safety risk. These drugs  have been detected during autopsy in general aviation  accidents and, more commonly.

# THE PROBLEM:  

In 2015 there were 22,000 deaths involving prescription  opioids (natural, synthetic, and semi-synthetic), or 62  deaths per day. In addition to the increase in prescription  opioid misuse, America’s opioid epidemic is also driven  by a surge in illicit opioid overdoses, primarily heroin and  illegally made fentanyl, which accounted for an additional  15,000 deaths in the same year, or 42 deaths per day.  

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  data demonstrates that prescription misuse is significantly  associated with heroin use, as is overprescribing, which  facilitates non-medical use. The longer a prescription  opioid is taken, the higher the risk for misuse and potential  addiction and overdose.  

While the average volume of opioids prescribed per capita  has declined since 2010, the average duration of opioid  prescriptions in 2015 is 18 days, a  $38\%$   increase from  2006. The rates of abuse and dependence (10.8–12.9 per  1,000) are the highest in 13 states: West Virginia, Oregon,  Indiana, Rhode Island, Arizona, Kentucky, Oklahoma, New  Hampshire, Massachusetts, Arkansas, Nevada, Washington,  and Delaware.  While these numbers seem staggering, it is  estimated that specific drugs are not recorded on  $17\%$   of  death certificates 4

# MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT OPIOIDS  

The stimulation of the opioid receptors in the deeper  regions of the brain results in drowsiness that could lead to  respiratory depression which, in turn, can lead to overdose  and death. Interestingly, with repeated administration of  opioid drugs, the production of endogenous opioids will  decrease. This is the cause of the discomfort that occurs  when opioid drugs are withdrawn.  

People who take opioids by non-prescribed routes of  administration also run the risk of death by respiratory  arrest or coma. This is especially true of long acting or  extended-release formulations.  

Opioids have a tendency,  when they are used  repeatedly, to result in  tolerance. Tolerance results  from the ability of opioids  to desensitize the brain’s  own opioid system, making

it less responsive over time. This tolerance contributes to the  elevated risk of overdose during a period of relapse of opioid  use after a period of abstinence, so users who may not realize  they have lost their tolerance during a period of abstinence  may initially take a dangerously high dosage.  

# IMPACT OF CHRONIC PAIN  

According to government estimates,  chronic pain affects  an estimated 100 million Americans, or one third of the  U.S. population. Approximately 25 million people have  moderate to severe chronic pain significant enough to limit  activity and affect performance.

# DEPENDENCY PREVENTION  

Opioid medications used long term can lead to addiction.  One long-term study looking at the effects of opioids on  pain relief, quality of life, and functional capacity showed 
 no benefit.  

While opioids are considered the best treatment for  some types of pain, an NIH expert advisory panel 5   recommended potentially effective alternatives such as  “a range of progressive approaches that might initially  include non p harm a co logic options, such as physical  therapy, behavioral therapy, and complementary and  alternative medicine approaches with demonstrated efficacy,  followed by pharmacologic options, including nonopioid  p harm a co therapies.”  

The bottom line is increased awareness is needed  regarding treatment options, which suggests solutions as  individual as a patient’s own response to pain.

# INFORMATION FOR AVIATION  MEDICAL EXAMINERS AND PILOTS:  

All U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS)-certified test facilities were mandated to  implement procedures for expanded opioid testing  (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and  oxymorphone) after midnight September 30, 2017.  While implementation is pending, those in safety  sensitive positions, including pilots and air traffic  controllers, should implement the following  best practices:  

•	 Do not take another person’s medication. It is 


 	 	 unlawful; it was prescribed for a specific purpose 


 	 	 and person for whom the provider evaluated 


 	 	 potential drug interaction and disease conditions. 

 	 •	 Do not take medication for a condition other than 


 	 	 for what it was prescribed. For example, do not use 


 	 	 unused medications dispensed for a root canal for 


 	 	 your sudden onset of back pain. Narcotics should 


 	 	 not be used without knowing the diagnosis of 


 	 	 the painful condition. You could be masking a life 


 	 	 threatening-disorder and risking your life.

 	 •	 Do dispose of unused medications. The Drug 


 	 	 Enforcement Agency (DEA) and local health 


 	 	 programs run medication take-back programs. 


 	 	 Unfortunately, the drugs in our homes can be 


 	 	 diverted for illicit use.

 	 •	 Do consider an over-the-counter test kit before 


 	 	 resuming safety-related duties. This will assess your 


 	 	 likelihood of testing positive.
