# Seat Belts and  Shoulder Harnesses Smart Protection in  Small Airplanes  

W e   all   enjoy  the convenience, fun and  safety of flying. We also understand  that there may be times when our  best efforts for a safe flight will be inadequate,  and an accident could happen.  

While most accidents are minor and pose  no significant risk to the airplane or its occu- pants, some can result in major injuries or fatali- ties. However, studies of serious accidents have  shown that the proper use of shoulder harnesses,  in addition to the safety belt, would reduce  major  injuries by 88 percent and reduce fatalities by 20  percent.  

# INSTALL SHOULDER HARNESSES IN  YOUR AIRPLANE  

Shoulder harnesses have been required for all  seats in small airplanes manufactured since De- cember 12, 1986. If your airplane is not equipped  with them, you should obtain kits for installing  shoulder harnesses from the manufacturer or the  manufacturer’s local sales representative.Man And Woman Using Seat BeltsMan And Woman Using Seat Belts 2

# USE THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM...  PROPERLY  

Federal regulations 1  require that safety belts  and shoulder harnesses (when installed) be prop- erly worn during landings and takeoffs. If the  restraint is not worn properly, it cannot provide  full benefits and can even cause injury in a seri- ous impact.  

Tests have shown  that slack in the restraint  system should be mini- mal. In an impact, your  body keeps moving until  the slack is taken out of  the restraint, but then  must be abruptly stopped  to “catch up” with the  airplane. The restraint  should be adjusted as  tightly as your comfort  will permit to minimize  potential injuries. Image 1

The safety belt should  be placed low on your  hipbones so that the  belt loads will be taken  by the strong skeleton  of your body. If the  safety belt is improp- erly positioned on your  abdomen, it can cause  internal injuries. If the  safety belt is positioned  on your thighs, rather

than the hipbones, it cannot effectively limit  your body’s forward motion. Image 2Image 3  

Shoulder harness  systems can use dual  shoulder belts or a single  diagonal belt similar to  those used in automo- biles. The belts should  not rub against your head  or neck. This is uncom- fortable, will discourage  use of the shoulder har- ness, and can also cause  neck injuries during an  impact.

Single diagonal shoul- der belts should be posi- tioned so that the torso’s  center of gravity falls  within the angle formed by  the shoulder belt and the  safety belt. Otherwise your  torso may roll right out of  the shoulder belt during an  impact and compromise  your protection.

Because the lower end  of the shoulder belt is usu- ally fastened to the safety  belt buckle or the buckle  insert, the safety belt buck- le should be positioned on  the side of your hip. This  differs from the central  location of the buckle that  is common when only the  safety belt is used.

Be sure that the safety belt is installed so that  when the buckle is unlatched, both the safety belt  and the shoulder belt are released. Also, be sure  that the buckle can be unlatched without interfer- ence from the seat armrest, aircraft controls, or the  interior wall of the airplane.  

If the shoulder harness uses dual belts fastened  to the safety belt near the center of your body, the  shoulder belts will tend to pull the safety belt up  off your hip bones. This could cause internal inju- ries in an impact.  

When it is  tightened about  your hips, the  safety belt should  be positioned so  that it makes an  angle of about 55  degrees with the  centerline of the  airplane.

This allows it  to resist the up- ward pull of the  shoulder belts,  reducing the risk  of internal injury.Image 4Image 5Image 6  

Otherwise, a tie- down strap from the  buckle to the center- forward edge of the  seat may be neces- sary to resist the  upward pull of the  shoulder belts.  

If your restraint

system uses a tie-down strap, adjust it to remove  all the slack when the restraint system is used. A  properly installed and adjusted tie-down strap is  completely safe.Image 7  

# DON’T FORGET THE CHILDREN...  

For maximum protection and safety, small chil- dren should be placed and secured in approved  “child safety seat” devices during aircraft opera- tion. Child safety seats must meet current manu- facturing and identification requirements of the  Federal government and be installed and secured  in accordance with these regulations. Install the  safety seat in a rear airplane seat, but not near an  entry door or emergency exit. If you must use a  front airplane seat, make sure that the child seat  cannot interfere with the airplane controls or limit  pilot access to the radios and flight instruments.  

Install the child safety seat according to the  instructions on the seat, using the airplane safety  belt to secure it. Most safety seats for small infants  are intended to place the infant in a rear-facing  position and should be installed that way in the  airplane.

Remember to consider the weight of the child  and child safety seat when calculating weight and  balance!  

When children outgrow the safety seat, they  can safely get by using only the airplane seat belt.  Their small size limits the chance that they might  make contact with the airplane interior during an  impact. Larger children can use the shoulder har- ness if it doesn’t rub on their face or neck when  they are seated.Image 8  

# SUMMARY  

u   Seat belts alone will protect you only in  minor impacts. u   Using shoulder belts in small aircraft would   reduce major injuries by   $88\%$   and fatalities  by    $20\%$  . u  Shoulder belt kits are now available for most  airplanes. u   Proper use and installation of child safety  seats, meeting Federal requirements 1 , provide  good protection for small children in aircraft. u   If improperly installed and used, restraints  could cause injury. u   Restraint systems in small aircraft: a smart  idea!
