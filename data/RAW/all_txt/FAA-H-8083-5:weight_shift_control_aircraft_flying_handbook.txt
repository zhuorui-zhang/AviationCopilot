# Weight-Shift Control Aircraft  Flying Handbook  

2008  

# Preface  

The Weight-Shift Control (WSC) Aircraft Flying Handbook introduces the basic pilot knowledge and skills that are essential  for piloting WSC aircraft. It introduces pilots to the broad spectrum of knowledge that is needed as they progress in their  pilot training. This handbook is for student pilots, as well as those pursuing more advanced pilot certiﬁ  cates.  

Student pilots learning to ﬂ  y WSC aircraft, certiﬁ  cated pilots preparing for additional WSC ratings or who desire to improve  their ﬂ  ying proﬁ  ciency and aeronautical knowledge, and commercial WSC pilots teaching WSC students how to ﬂ  y should  ﬁ  nd this handbook helpful. This book introduces the prospective pilot to the realm of WSC ﬂ  ight and provides information  and guidance to all WSC pilots in the performance of various maneuvers and procedures.  

This handbook conforms to pilot training and certiﬁ  cation concepts established by the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA). There are different ways of teaching, as well as performing ﬂ  ight procedures and maneuvers, and many variations  in the explanations of aerodynamic theories and principles. This handbook adopts a selective method and concept to ﬂ  ying  WSC aircraft. The discussions and explanations reﬂ  ect the most commonly used practices and principles. Occasionally,  the word “must” or similar language is used where the desired action is deemed critical. The use of such language is not  intended to add to, interpret, or relieve a duty imposed by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  

It is essential for persons using this handbook also to become familiar with and apply the pertinent parts of   $14~\mathrm{CFR}$   and  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). Performance standards for demonstrating competence required for pilot  certiﬁ  cation are prescribed in the appropriate WSC practical test standard.  

This handbook is available for download, in PDF format, from the FAA website, www.faa.gov.

# Introduction To  Weight-Shift Control  

# Introduction  

Weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft means a powered aircraft  with a framed pivoting wing and a fuselage controllable only  in pitch and roll by the pilot’s ability to change the aircraft’s  center of gravity (CG) with respect to the wing. Flight control  of the aircraft depends on the wing’s ability to deform ﬂ  exibly  rather than on the use of control surfaces.  

This chapter provides background on the development of the  WSC aircraft, its unique characteristics, the requirements for  obtaining a WSC license (airman certiﬁ  cate), aeronautical  decision-making (ADM), and the unique medical factors  required to operate WSC aircraft safely. Further, it is highly  recommended that all pilots develop a general understanding  of aviation by becoming familiar with the Pilot’s Handbook  of Aeronautical Knowledge and the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM). Listings of other available handbooks can be  found on the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website  at www.faa.gov.  

# History  

From the beginning of mankind, we have looked to the skies  where legends and myths have entertained and provided us  the dream to ﬂ  y. Through the middle ages, the idea of ﬂ  ight  evolved across Europe, with Leonardo Da Vinci well known  for designing ﬂ  ying machines to carry humans. In 1874,   Otto  Lilienthal, a German mechanical engineer, started designing,  building, and flying bird-like wings.  [Figure 1-1]  He  published his work in 1889, and by 1891 made ﬂ  ights of  

![](images/82c1451664a82fe8d07b57ff38d67a409c63cb0fbe4bfa81890e3a3ea6b0f83a.jpg)

over 100 feet in distance. Otto was the ﬁ  rst successful hang  glider pilot to design, build, and ﬂ  y a number of wing designs.  [Figure 1-2]  

In 1903, the Wright brothers’ gliders became powered and  the airplane was born as the   Wright Flyer. In the early 1900s,  aircraft conﬁ  gurations evolved as faster speeds and heavier  loads were placed on aircraft in ﬂ  ight. As a result of the new  demands, the simple ﬂ  exible wing was no longer sufﬁ  cient  and aircraft designers began to incorporate rigid wings with  mechanical aerodynamic controls. These new ideas in wing  design eventually resulted in the familiar aileron and rudder  conﬁ  gurations found on the modern airplane.  

Commercial applications were driving the need for faster and  heavier aircraft; however, the dream of achieving manned  powered ﬂ  ight in its most bird-like form was evolving along  a different path. As rigid wing design enjoyed development  for military and commercial applications, the ﬂ  exible wing  concept lay largely dormant for decades. In 1948, a ﬂ  exible  wing design was created by   Francis Melvin Rogallo as a ﬂ  ying  toy kit for which he obtained a patent in 1951.  [Figure 1-3]  

Rogallo’s design concept evolved down two parallel paths  in the early 1960s, military and sport ﬂ  ight. The military  application was the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) development of the Rogallo wing  into the Paresev (Paraglider Research Vehicle) later renamed  the Parawing. That aircraft had rigid leading edges shown  in  Figure 1-4 . NASA had the cart attached to the keel hanging  below the wing and using weight shift to control the wing in  the same fashion as modern WSC aircraft today.

Figure 1-4.  NASA testing the Rogallo wing, which led to the modern  hang glider and WSC aircraft.  

During this same period, other pioneering engineers and  enthusiasts started developing the Rogallo wing for sport. One  was aeronautical engineer, Barry Palmer, who saw pictures of  the NASA wings and, in 1961, constructed and ﬂ  ew a number  of hang gliders based on the Rogallo design.  [Figure 1-5]   His efforts and others evolved to the WSC aircraft in the late  1960s. Another pioneer was John Dickenson of Australia  who used the NASA Rogallo wing design but incorporated  a triangular control bar that provided structure for the wing  during ﬂ  ight with ﬂ  ying wires.  [Figure 1-6]

# Hang Glider  

The WSC system and the good ﬂ  ying qualities of the Rogallo  wing and Dickenson wing, combined with its easy set-up  and portability, started the hang gliding craze in the early  1970s.  [Figure 1-7]  In 1967, the ﬁ  rst powered aircraft based  on the ﬂ  exible wing concept of Dr. Rogallo was registered  as amateur-built experimental. Flexible wing development  continued, and by the early 1970s several adventurous  entrepreneurs were manufacturing Rogallo wings for sport  use.  

![](images/fc3f6a9f1921aff49e48aeb54c6a9f1fed03c1f9f7bc34649170830b6d0acf03.jpg)  
Figure 1-7.  An original Rogallo wing, 1975.  

Another signiﬁ  cant step in wing design was an airfoil that  would change shape for optimum performance at slow and  fast speeds. It was the ﬁ  rst Rogallo wing with a lower surface  that could enclose the structure that holds the wings out.  Enclosing this cross bar tube and providing a thicker airfoil  similar to the airplane wing provided a jump in high speed  performance. This double-surface wing was quickly adopted  by manufacturers as the high performance standard and is  used on faster WSC aircraft today.  [Figure 1-8]  

Activity in the hang gliding community increased throughout  the 1970s, which resulted in the proliferation and development  of stable, high-quality modern hang gliders like the one  shown in  Figure 1-9 .  

# Motorized Hang Gliders  

In the late 1970s, performance had increased enough to allow  motors to be added to hang gliders and ﬂ  own practically. It  was not until the wings had become efﬁ  cient and the engines  and propeller systems evolved that the ﬁ  rst commercial motor  for a hang glider was introduced in 1977, the Soarmaster. It  used a two-stroke engine with a reduction system, clutch, and  long drive-shaft that bolted to the wing frame. It had a climb  rate as high as 200 feet per minute (fpm) which was acceptable  for practical ﬂ  ight. However, during takeoff the wing would  overtake the running pilot, and launching was very difﬁ  cult.  Also while ﬂ  ying, if the pilot went weightless or stalled under  power, the glider would shoot forward and nose down into  a dive. Overall, with the propeller pushing the wing forward  during takeoffs and in some situations while ﬂ  ying, this was  unsafe for a wide application.  [Figure 1-10]  

# A Maturing Industry  

Engines and airframe technology had made great advances  because the ultralight ﬁ  xed wing evolution was providing lighter  weight, higher power, and more reliable propulsion systems.  

The propeller was moved lower for better takeoff and ﬂ  ight  characteristics, wheels were added, and the trike was born at  the end of the 1970s. A trike describes a Rogallo type wing  with a three wheeled carriage underneath (much like a tricycle  arrangement with one wheel in front and two in back). Trike  is the industry term to describe both ultralight vehicles and

Light-Sport Aircraft (LSA) WSC aircraft.  [Figure 1-11]  The  major trike manufacturers were formed in the early 1980s  and continue to deliver trikes worldwide today.  

# New Challenges  

By the 1980s, individuals were rapidly developing and  operating small powered trikes. This development failed  to address the sport nature and unique challenges these  new aircraft presented to the aviation community. In an  attempt to include these ﬂ  ying machines in its regulatory  framework, the FAA issued Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (14 CFR) part 103, Ultralight Vehicles, in 1982.  Aircraft falling within the ultralight vehicle speciﬁ  cations  are lightweight (less than 254 pounds if powered, or 155  pounds if unpowered), are intended for manned operation

by a single occupant, have a fuel capacity of ﬁ  ve gallons  or less, a maximum calibrated airspeed of not more than 55  knots, and a maximum stall speed of not more than 24 knots.  Ultralight vehicles do not require pilot licensing, medical  certiﬁ  cation, or aircraft registration. Ultralight vehicles are  deﬁ  ned in more detail with their operating limitations in 14  CFR part 103.  

Because training was so important for the single-place  ultralight vehicle pilots, the FAA granted an exemption that  allowed the use of two-seat ultralight vehicles for training,  and the sport of two-seat ultralight training vehicles grew.  Throughout the 1990s, worldwide sales of both single- seat and two-seat ultralight vehicles soared, but it was the  proliferation of two-seat trainers that took the industry and the  regulators by surprise. Worldwide sales of two-seat ultralight  vehicle trainers vastly outnumbered the sales of single-seat  ultralight vehicles; and it became clear that the two-seat  trainers, which were intended to be operated as trainers only,  were being used for sport and recreational purposes. This  created a demand for increased comfort and reliability, which  resulted in heavier, more sophisticated machines.  

# Light Sport Aircraft (LSA)  

To address the evolution of the ultralight vehicle and its  community of sport users, the FAA issued new rules on  September 1, 2004. These rules created a new category of  LSA and a new classiﬁ  cation of FAA pilot certiﬁ  cation to ﬂ  y  LSA, called Sport Pilot. Additional guidelines established by  the FAA can be found in 14 CFR part 61.  [Figure 1-12]  This  handbook focuses on the WSC aircraft.  

Aircraft certiﬁ  cated as LSA exceed the limitations deﬁ  ned  for ultralight vehicles and require that the pilot possess, at a  minimum, a Sport Pilot certiﬁ  cate. The sport pilot rule deﬁ  nes  the limitations and privileges for both the sport pilot and the  

![](images/91507d2661d775905c843ecd08cfaf99aa40ed467a03aba88b37623310951f77.jpg)  
Figure 1-12.   Examples of LSA, from top to bottom: gyroplane,  airplane, powered parachute, and weight-shift control aircraft.  

LSA. In addition, the regulations governing the sport pilot rule  deﬁ  ne the training requirements of prospective sport pilots  and the airworthiness requirements for their machines. For  instance, an ultralight vehicle must not exceed 254 pounds  or carry more than one person. Aircraft that carry more than  one person and weigh over 254 pounds but less than 1,320  pounds may be certiﬁ  ed as LSA provided they meet speciﬁ  c  certiﬁ  cation requirements. Therefore, many WSC ultralight  vehicles became LSA (provided they were properly inspected  and issued an airworthiness certiﬁ  cate by the FAA).  

# Weight-Shift Control Aircraft  

WSC aircraft are single- and two-place trikes that do not meet  the criteria of an ultralight vehicle but do meet the criteria of  LSA. The deﬁ  nition for WSC can be found in 14 CFR part 1.  Flight control of the aircraft depends on the wing’s ability to  ﬂ  exibly deform rather than on the use of control surfaces.  

The common acronyms for this LSA are WSC (weight-shift  control); WSCL (WSC land), which can be wheels or ski  equipped; and WSCS (WSC Sea) for water operations. A  LSA WSC used for sport and private pilot ﬂ  ying must be  registered with a FAA N-number, have an airworthiness  certificate, a pilot’s operating handbook (POH), and/or  limitations with a weight and loading document aboard. The  aircraft must be maintained properly by the aircraft owner  or other qualiﬁ  ed personnel and have the aircraft logbooks  available for inspection. Dual ﬂ  ight controls are required in  two-seat aircraft used for training.  

The carriage is comprised of the engine and ﬂ  ight deck  attached by a structure to wheels, ﬂ  oats, or skis; it may also  be referred to as the fuselage. The wing is the sail, structure  that supports the sail, battens (ribs) that form the airfoil, and  associated hardware.  [Figure 1-13]  

![](images/bd5d3411042ba50e51e827f933efc08272302b5f453cc57595a0a390ad28fd4d.jpg)  
Figure 1-13.   Carriage and wing of a WSC aircraft.  

There are several unique features of the WSC aircraft:  

•  The wing structure is in the pilot’s hands and is used  to control the aircraft. There are no mechanical devices  between the pilot and the wing. The pilot can directly  feel the atmosphere while ﬂ  ying through it because the  pilot is holding the wing. This is a direct connection  between the wing and the pilot like no other aircraft. •  The pilot can feel the wing as the wingtips or nose  moves up and down, but the carriage and passenger  are more stable. Turbulence is not felt as much as in  a ﬁ  xed-wing aircraft. •  Different wings can be put on a single carriage. This  allows the pilot to have a large wing that can take off  in short distances, which would be good for low and  slow ﬂ  ying. A large wing with a lightweight carriage  can also be used for soaring and is capable of ﬂ  ying  at speeds below 30 miles per hour (mph). At the other  extreme, a smaller high performance wing can be  used for ﬂ  ying long distances at high speeds. With a  small wing and a larger motor, WSC aircraft can ﬂ  y  at speeds up to  $100\;\mathrm{mph}$  . •  The wing can be taken off the carriage and folded up  into a tube that can be easily transported and stored.  This allows owners to store the WSC aircraft in a  trailer or garage, transport the WSC aircraft to a local  site, and set it up anywhere.  [Figure 1-14]  

![](images/de90f9b30391ed242bc838acd2496ddf9b27a652461bb9fbaab26ea9ba5487c8.jpg)  
Figure 1-14.   Wing folded and on top of a recreational vehicle with  the carriage in a trailer.  

•  Since the WSC aircraft is designed without the weight  and drag of a tail, the performance is signiﬁ  cantly  increased. The aircraft can take off and land in short  fields, has good climb rates, can handle a large  payload, has a good glide ratio, and is fuel efﬁ  cient.  The WSC LSA typically can carry 600 pounds of  people, fuel, and baggage.  

Besides having large and small wings for different speeds,  the WSC aircraft wings can have wires for bracing, struts,  or a combination of both. Throughout this handbook, both  are used in diagrams and pictures. WSC aircraft are typically  on wheels, but there are models that can land and take off on  water and snow.  [Figure 1-15]

# Weight-Shift Control LSA Requirements  

A WSC LSA must meet the following requirements:  

1.  A maximum takeoff weight of not more than— •   1,320 pounds (600 kilograms) for aircraft not  intended for operation on water; or  

•   1,430 pounds (650 kilograms) for an aircraft  intended for operation on water 2.  A maximum airspeed in level ﬂ  ight with maximum  continuous power   $\mathrm{(V_{H})}$   of not more than 120 knots  calibrated (computed) air speed (CAS) under standard  atmospheric conditions at sea level. 3.  A maximum stalling speed or minimum steady ﬂ  ight  speed without the use of lift-enhancing devices   $(\mathbf{V}_{S1})$   of not more than 45 knots CAS at the aircraft’s  maximum certiﬁ  cated takeoff weight and most critical  center of gravity. 4.  A maximum seating capacity of no more than two  persons, including the pilot. 5.  A single reciprocating engine. 6.  A ﬁ  xed or ground-adjustable propeller. 7.  Fixed landing gear, except for an aircraft intended for  operation on water. 8.  Fixed or retractable landing gear, or a hull, for an  aircraft intended for operation on water.  

# Flight Operations and Pilot Certiﬁ  cates  

The FAA is empowered by the United States Congress to  promote aviation safety by prescribing safety standards for  civil aviation programs and pilots. Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR), formerly referred to as Federal  Aviation Regulations (FAR), is one of the primary means of  conveying these safety standards.  [Figure 1-16]  14 CFR part  61 speciﬁ  es the requirements to earn a pilot certiﬁ  cate and  obtain additional WSC privileges if already a pilot. 14 CFR  part 91 is General Operating and Flight Rules for pilots. The  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) provides basic ﬂ  ight  information and operation procedures for pilots to operate in  the National Airspace System (NAS).  

![](images/bb7aa791127af5474585aea70ed75c13f584339c893332146fec557ecc1d662c.jpg)  
Figure 1-16.   Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and Aeronautical  Information Manual (AIM).  

# Basic Pilot Eligibility  

Title 14 CFR, part 61 speciﬁ  es the requirements to earn a  pilot certiﬁ  cate. This regulation also states the pilot applicant  must be able to read, speak, write, and understand the English  language. The FAA Practical Test Standards (PTS) establish  the standards for the knowledge and skills necessary for the  issuance of a pilot certiﬁ  cate. It is important to reference both  of these documents to understand the knowledge, skills, and  experience required to obtain a pilot certiﬁ  cate to ﬂ  y a WSC  aircraft.  [Figure 1-17]  

![](images/16b0e57bfebd226f89d56f144ba9e6c28605001862a822c31ee1fe717c0f6f69.jpg)  
Figure 1-17.  Sport Pilot Practical Test Standards for Weight Shift  Control, Powered Parachute, and Flight Instructor.  

Pilot applicants and students ﬂ  ying solo must have a valid  driver’s license or a current third-class medical certiﬁ  cate  issued under 14 CFR part 67. In addition to a valid driver’s  license or a medical certiﬁ  cate, each pilot must determine  before each ﬂ  ight that he or she is medically ﬁ  t to operate  the aircraft in a safe manner. If using a valid driver’s license  to exercise the privileges of a sport pilot certiﬁ  cate, then  all restrictions on that driver’s license are also upheld. A  current FAA third-class medical certiﬁ  cate must be obtained  to exercise the privileges of a WSC private pilot certiﬁ  cate.  Existing pilots, including previous student pilots, who have  had their FAA medical certiﬁ  cate or most recent application  denied, revoked, withdrawn, or suspended by the FAA, are  not allowed to operate using a driver’s license until the denial  on the airman record is cleared by having a valid third class  medical certiﬁ  cate issued.  

# Flight Safety Practices  

In the interest of safety and good habit pattern formation,  there are certain basic ﬂ  ight safety practices and procedures  that must be emphasized by the ﬂ  ight instructor and adhered  to by both instructor and student, beginning with the very  ﬁ  rst dual instruction ﬂ  ight. These include, but are not limited  to, collision avoidance procedures including proper scanning  techniques and clearing procedures, runway incursion  avoidance, and positive transfer of controls.  

# Collision Avoidance  

All pilots must be alert to the potential for midair collision  and near midair collisions. The general operating and  ﬂ  ight rules in 14 CFR part 91 set forth the concept of “see  and avoid.” This concept requires that vigilance shall be  maintained at all times by each person operating an aircraft.  Most midair collision accidents and reported near midair  collision incidents occur in good visual ﬂ  ight rules (VFR)  weather conditions and during the hours of daylight. Most of  these accident/incidents occur within ﬁ  ve miles of an airport  and/or near navigation aids.  

The “see and avoid” concept relies on knowledge of the  limitations of the human eye, and the use of proper visual  scanning techniques to help compensate for these limitations.  The importance of, and the proper techniques for, visual  scanning should be taught to a student pilot at the very  beginning of ﬂ  ight training. The competent ﬂ  ight instructor  should be familiar with the visual scanning and collision  avoidance information contained in Advisory Circular  (AC) 90-48, Pilot’s Role in Collision Avoidance, and the  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

It should be noted that any turn or maneuver must be  cleared before initiating. This is a most important concept  in ﬂ  ying any aircraft. Look and clear the area of any aircraft  or obstructions before any maneuver is performed. As an  example, if a right hand turn is to be performed, the pilot  must look right and clear the area before initiating any turn  to the right. This “clearing procedure” must be done before  performing any maneuver.  

This is an important habit for any student for safety purposes  and is incorporated into the pilot certiﬁ  cation process. The  pilot must be trained by a CFI in effectively clearing the area  before any maneuver is performed.  

There are many different types of clearing procedures. Most  are centered around the use of clearing turns. Some pilot  training programs have hard-and-fast rules, such as requiring  two   $90^{\circ}$   turns in opposite directions before executing any  training maneuver. Other types of clearing procedures may  be developed by individual ﬂ  ight instructors. Whatever  the preferred method, the ﬂ  ight instructor should teach the  beginning student an effective clearing procedure and require  its use. The student pilot should execute the appropriate  clearing procedure before all turns and before executing any  training maneuver. Proper clearing procedures, combined  with proper visual scanning techniques, are the most effective  strategy for collision avoidance.  

# Runway Incursion Avoidance  

A runway incursion is any occurrence at an airport involving  an aircraft, vehicle, person, or object on the ground that  creates a collision hazard or results in a loss of separation  with an aircraft taking off, landing, or intending to land. The  three major areas contributing to runway incursions are:  

•   Communications, •   Airport knowledge, and •   Flight deck procedures for maintaining orientation.  

Taxi operations require constant vigilance by the pilot and can  be assisted by the passenger. This is especially true during  ﬂ  ight training operations. Both the student pilot and the ﬂ  ight  instructor need to be continually aware of the movement and  location of other aircraft and ground vehicles on the airport  movement area. Many ﬂ  ight training activities are conducted  at nontowered airports. The absence of an operating airport  control tower creates a need for increased vigilance on the  part of pilots operating at those airports.  

Planning, clear communications, and enhanced situational  awareness during airport surface operations will reduce the  potential for surface incidents. Safe aircraft operations can be  accomplished and incidents eliminated if the pilot is properly  trained from the outset and, throughout his or her ﬂ  ying  career, accomplishes standard taxi operating procedures and  practices. This requires the development of the formalized  teaching of safe operating practices during taxi operations.  

# Positive Transfer of Controls  

During flight training, there must always be a clear  understanding between the student and ﬂ  ight instructor of  who has control of the aircraft. Prior to any dual training  ﬂ  ight, the instructor should conduct a brieﬁ  ng that includes  the procedure for the exchange of flight controls. The  following three-step process for the exchange of flight  controls is highly recommended.  

When a ﬂ  ight instructor wishes the student to take control  of the aircraft, he or she should say to the student, “You  have the ﬂ  ight controls.” The student should acknowledge  immediately by saying, “I have the ﬂ  ight controls.” The ﬂ  ight  instructor conﬁ  rms by again saying, “You have the ﬂ  ight  controls.” Part of the procedure should be a visual check to  ensure that the other person actually has the ﬂ  ight controls.  When returning the controls to the ﬂ  ight instructor, the student  should follow the same procedure the instructor used when  giving control to the student. The student should stay on the  controls until the instructor says: “I have the ﬂ  ight controls.”  There should never be any doubt regarding who is ﬂ  ying the  WSC aircraft. Numerous accidents have occurred due to a  lack of communication or misunderstanding regarding who  actually had control of the aircraft, particularly between  student and ﬂ  ight instructor. Establishing the positive transfer  of controls procedure during initial training will ensure the  formation of a very beneﬁ  cial habit pattern.  

# Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)  

A PIC’s attitude or mindset must always be alert in order to  maintain the safety of the aircraft, passengers, and the general  public on the ground. To accomplish sound aeronautical  decision-making (ADM), a pilot must be aware of his or  her limitations and well-being (physical and psychological  health), even before beginning the ﬁ  rst preﬂ  ight routine.  While technology is constantly improving equipment and  strengthening materials, safe flight comes down to the  decisions made by the human pilot prior to and during  ﬂ  ight.  

The well-being of the pilot is the starting point for the  decision-making process that occurs while in control of the  aircraft. Just as physical fatigue and illness directly affects  a pilot’s judgment, so too will attitude management, stress  management, risk management, personality tendencies, and  situational awareness. Hence, it is the awareness of human  factors and the knowledge of the related corrective action that  not only improves the safety of operating a WSC aircraft, but  also enhances the joy of ﬂ  ying.  [Figure 1-18]  

A good starting point is the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25), which explains the decision- making process, resource management, situational awareness,  pilot error, stress management, risk management techniques,  and hazardous attitude antidotes. After reading and  understanding those subjects, it should be understood that  the scenarios presented are generally for more complex  airplanes, but the thought process and results are the same  for all aircraft. The information is not duplicated but the  

![](images/572d59d3deaa862ef716327906ed4208844b96cc75ab076ffc311e4a1082d67b.jpg)  
Figure 1-18.   Awareness of human factors and how it affects the decision-making process.  

differences and additional information speciﬁ  c to WSC is  provided in subsequent sections.  

The differences in the more complex airplane requirement  scenarios presented in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge versus WSC aircraft characteristics can easily  be compared. Overall, the advantage of an LSA is the  simpler design requiring less pilot attention than the complex  requirements of more complicated designs that add to the  pilot’s workload, such as:  

•  Constant speed propellers •  Multiple engines •  Retractable landing gears  •  Faster airspeeds  

The unique characteristics on the WSC aircraft that increase  ADM tasks are:  

•  Open ﬂ  ight deck where maps or other materials cannot  be opened, shown, and discussed with passenger. •  Pusher propeller in the back, through which any  loose item on the ﬂ  ight deck can be pulled, possibly  producing severe damage, depending on the size of  the object. •  More physical strength and endurance required to ﬂ  y  in turbulent conditions, which adds an additional risk  element.  

# Avoiding Pilot Errors  

Overall, WSC aircraft are flown for fun and not for  transportation. Generally, it is determined that the pilot  will not ﬂ  y in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC)  without the assistance and training of the attitude indicator.  Pilots must make the decision to stay out of IMC conditions  and turn back immediately if the situation occurs. This is  what most pilots should do, but the information provided  by the attitude indicator allows pilots to start the “error  chain” that can lead to catastrophic consequences. The best  immediate decision is always to turn back and not go into  IMC conditions in a WSC aircraft.  

With an open ﬂ  ight deck, the problem of items getting loose  and hitting the propeller requires extra caution. Being in a  hurry, not making sure everything is secured, and forgetting  to brief the passenger can trigger one event that leads to  another. Exercising caution in the open ﬂ  ight deck is an  important step for WSC pilots.  

If ﬂ  ying a WSC aircraft in turbulence, the pilot must have  both hands on the bar to maintain control of the aircraft.  Therefore, changing radio frequencies, measuring courses  on the map, or operating any of the ﬂ  ight deck controls  becomes difﬁ  cult and secondary to maintaining control  of the aircraft. This is different from ﬂ  ying an airplane or  a powered parachute, which requires less physical effort  to maintain control of the aircraft and at least one hand is  available to tend to ﬂ  ight deck duties. It must be noted that the  ﬁ  rst priority always is maintaining control of the aircraft, and  all other duties are secondary. Generally, preﬂ  ight planning  and good pilot judgment would prevent a situation of ﬂ  ying  in moderate to extreme turbulence. However, when you do  ﬁ  nd yourself ﬂ  ying in this situation, ﬂ  y the aircraft ﬁ  rst, and  attend to ﬂ  ight deck duties second.  

# Scenario-Based Training  

A good instructor immediately begins teaching ADM  when the student has the ability to control the WSC aircraft  conﬁ  dently during the most basic maneuvers. The instructor  incorporates “scenario-based training” in which the instructor  provides pilot, aircraft, environment, and operational risk  elements to train the student to utilize ADM in making  the best decision for a given set of circumstances. During  a proﬁ  ciency or practical test, the instructor or examiner  evaluates the applicant’s ability to use satisfactory ADM  practices as the pilot determines risks and coordinates safe  procedures.  

# Resource Management  

Resource management is similar to that described in the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083- 25) except the passenger cannot help in the same ways as in  an airplane. The passenger cannot hold or help read the map  unless the pilot has provided a knee board or other means  for the passenger to assist.  [Figure 1-19]  

![](images/46f777e2b4e6e6a7e0bf1cbdf2019aee54b9eaa1f1f74f25ffef0705d9c6a91f.jpg)  
Figure 1-19.   Kneeboards help secure items in the flight deck.  

In addition to having the passenger scan the skies for other  aircraft, the passenger can maintain control of the aircraft for  short periods as the WSC is relatively easy to ﬂ  y straight.  This permits the pilot to perform unanticipated flight  deck functions during ﬂ  ight. Overall, preﬂ  ight planning  and passenger brieﬁ  ngs are additional tasks of resource  management for the WSC aircraft.  

# Use of Checklists  

Checklists have been the foundation of pilot standardization  and ﬂ  ight deck safety for many years and the ﬁ  rst defense  against the error chain that leads to accidents.  [Figure 1-20]  The  checklist is an aid to the fallible human memory and helps  to ensure that critical safety items are not overlooked or  forgotten. However, checklists are of no value if the pilot is not  committed to their use. Without discipline and dedication in  using a checklist, the odds favor the possibility of an error.  

![](images/9cece5faa565ff6f1f8b4a51ee9652712537d899ac5fb5fcb1f63caed887de93.jpg)  
Figure 1-20.   Example of a checklist.  

The importance of consistent use of checklists cannot be  overstated in pilot training. A major objective in primary ﬂ  ight  training is to establish habitual patterns that will serve pilots  well throughout their ﬂ  ying careers. The ﬂ  ight instructor must  promote a positive attitude toward the use of checklists, and  the student pilot must recognize their importance.  

Because of the evolution of WSC aircraft and their simplicity,  it could be thought that written checklists are not required.  Nothing is further from the truth. Following good written  checklists provides signiﬁ  cant safety for human factors,  which is the greatest cause of accidents in aviation.  

Five important written checklists must be used before ﬂ  ight.  These speciﬁ  c checklists are emphasized because of their  importance in avoiding pilot errors that can occur before or  during ﬂ  ight:  

1.  Preﬂ  ight preparation 2.  Routine preﬂ  ight inspection 3.  Passenger preﬂ  ight brief 4.  Engine start/taxi 5.  Preﬂ  ight check  

require signiﬁ  cant strength and endurance. This signiﬁ  cantly  adds to fatigue, as discussed in the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge. This is accomplished all the time by  experienced pilots, but it is a workout. If this type of workout  is combined with dehydration in a desert environment, a  greater than anticipated headwind, or ﬂ  ying an unfamiliar  cross-country route, the added aeromedical risk factors could  lead to a fatal error chain.  

Because checklists may not be practical in the open ﬂ  ight  deck during ﬂ  ight, and depending on the manufacturer and  make/model of the WSC aircraft, checklists used for climb,  en route, and landing may be placards in the ﬂ  ight deck that  can be read by the pilot in ﬂ  ight or used on kneeboards as  appropriate. Checklists must be secured to prevent their ﬂ  ying  through the propeller during taxi or ﬂ  ight.  

An additional written checklist that can be used on the ground  after landing is taxi, engine shutdown, postﬂ  ight inspection,  and securing aircraft.  

# Hypothermia  

Hypothermia is an important factor and knowledge  requirement in the WSC Practical Test Standards. Cold  temperatures for long periods reduce the inner body core  temperature when the heat produced by the body is less than  the amount of heat being lost to the body’s surroundings.  This loss of heat is highly accelerated in WSC open ﬂ  ight  decks with wind chill. The ﬁ  rst symptom of ﬂ  ying a WSC  aircraft is cold hands because of exposure to wind chill.  Symptoms continue with other parts of the body becoming  cold until the entire body feels cold. Hypothermia results in  weakness, shivering, lack of physical control, and slurred  speech followed by unconsciousness and death. Dressing  warm and/or aircraft heating systems to help the pilot remain  warm during flight prevents hypothermia. Motorcycle  gloves and socks that run off the aircraft electric system  are commonly used and can keep a pilot from getting cold.  [Figure 1-21]  Also, carrying an appropriate survival kit  

# Medical Factors  

A number of physiological effects can be linked to ﬂ  ying.  Some are minor, while others are important enough to  require special attention to ensure safety of ﬂ  ight. In some  cases, physiological factors can lead to inﬂ  ight emergencies.  Some important medical factors that a WSC pilot should  be aware of include hypoxia, hyperventilation, middle ear  and sinus problems, spatial disorientation, motion sickness,  carbon monoxide poisoning, stress and fatigue, dehydration,  heatstroke, and hypothermia. Other factors include the effects  of alcohol and drugs, and excess nitrogen in the blood after  scuba diving.  

A prerequisite to this chapter is the aeromedical factors  portion of the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  

(FAA-H-8083-25)  which provides detailed  information a pilot must  consider in all flight  operations. All of the  aeromedical factors  described in that book  are applicable to WSC.  However, the following  are additional topics  applicable to WSC not  speciﬁ  cally covered.  

![](images/afb552c1ff2dd387961e52f2b326acc0bf8c02834e95e9f0152098d40a761f45.jpg)  
Figure 1-21.   Motorcycle gloves and socks hooked to the 12-volt WSC electrical system keep the pilot and  passenger warm.  

# Fatigue  

Because the WSC  aircraft moves weight  through pilot input, there  is significant arm and  upper body strength  required to ﬂ  y a WSC  aircraft, especially in  turbulence. If flying  a cross-country flight  midday in moderate  turbulence for more than  an hour, a pilot would  

prepares a pilot against hypothermia if forced down in cold  temperatures.  

# Medical Summary  

Before approaching the WSC aircraft, a pilot must take  a moment to reﬂ  ect upon current medical, physical, and  psychological conditions. During this time, a pilot should  evaluate his or her ability to conduct the ﬂ  ight considering  self, passenger, and people and property on the ground.  Using the “I’M SAFE” checklist is a smart way to start a  preﬂ  ight before getting to the WSC aircraft. Prior to ﬂ  ight,  assess overall ﬁ  tness as well as the aircraft’s airworthiness.  [Figure 1-22]  

# Chapter Summary  

This chapter provides basic knowledge that is essential for  WSC pilots and should serve as a starting point for them.  However, there are many other handbooks, advisories, and  regulations with which all WSC pilots should become familiar  as their maturity within the aeronautical realm increases  and/or the need for greater depth of understanding becomes  necessary due to location, temperature, altitude, etc.  

![Figure 1-22.   Prior to flight, a pilot should assess overall fitness. ](images/95359721a5a381bbe572cd308c7d04092954db70aedcacc2b9364c4cf1383b4d.jpg)  

# Chapter 2 Aerodynamics  

This chapter focuses on the aerodynamic fundamentals unique  to weight-shift control (WSC) operations. The portions of the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083- 25) on principles of ﬂ  ight and aerodynamics apply to WSC  and are a prerequisite to reading this chapter.  

# Aerodynamic Terms  

Airfoil is the term used for a surface on an aircraft that  produces lift, typically the wing itself. Although many  different airfoil designs exist, all airfoils produce lift in a  similar manner.   Camber refers to the curvature of a wing

when looking at a cross-section. A wing possesses upper  camber on its top surface and lower camber on its bottom  surface. WSC airfoils can be single surface, with one piece of  fabric for most of the airfoil, for slower wings. Faster airfoils  have two surfaces and are called double surface wings, which  are more like an airplane wing.  [Figure 2-1]  This double

surface allows the wing structure to be enclosed inside the  wing, similar to an airplane wing, reducing drag and allowing  for faster speeds for the same thrust. The leading edge is the  forward edge of the airfoil, and the rear edge of the airfoil  is called the trailing edge. The chord line is an imaginary  straight line drawn from the leading edge to the trailing edge.  The WSC airfoil typically uses a different camber with the  airfoil high point farther forward than the airplane airfoil,  creating a more stable airfoil.  [Figure 2-2]

Figure 2-2.   Airplane airfoil compared to WSC airfoil.  

The WSC wing is a unique design of airfoils that differ  throughout the wing span. Looking at a top view of the wing,  in the center is the wing root and on each end is the wingtip.  Wing chord is any section of the wing parallel to the wing  root.  [Figures 2-3  and  2-4]  The wingtip chord is the chord  where the trailing edge is furthest to the rear of the wing. This  can be inboard of the tip (as shown) and can vary depending  on the speciﬁ  c wing design. The nose angle is the angle made  by the leading edges, typically ranging from   $120^{\circ}$   to   $130^{\circ}$  .  Sweep is the angle measured between the quarter chord line  (line of 25 percent chords) and a line perpendicular to the  root chord.  [Figure 2-3]

Figure 2-4.  Side view of a WSC wing and aerodynamic terms.  

Looking at the rear view of the wing, anhedral is the angle  the wings make angling down and dihedral is the angle the  wings make angling up.  [Figure 2-5]  Dihedral is the positive  angle formed between the lateral axis of an airplane and a line  which passes through the center of the wing. Anhedral is the  similar negative angle. Wings with sweep have an “effective  dihedral” characteristic that counteracts the physical anhedral  to develop the required roll stability for the particular make/ model design objective. This is explained in the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge in much greater detail  for further reference. Unlike airplanes which typically have  signiﬁ  cant dihedral as viewed from the front or back for  roll stability, WSC wings typically have a slight amount of  anhedral as shown in  Figure 2-5  and effective dihedral which  is a characteristic of the swept wing design.  

Wing twist is the decrease in chord angle from the root  to the tip chord, common to all WSC wings and ranging  from   $5^{\circ}$   to   $15^{\circ}$  . This wing twist is also called washout as  the wing decreases its angle of attack from root to tip. The  term billow was originally used for the early Rogallo wings  as the additional material in degrees that was added to the  airframe to create the airfoil. It is still used today to deﬁ  ne the  amount of twist or washout in the wing. The WSC may not  have twist/washout when sitting on the ground, and must be  ﬂ  ying and developing lift to display the proper aerodynamic  twist characteristic of WSC wings.  [Figure 2-6]  

The   longitudinal axis is an imaginary line about which the  aircraft rolls around its center of gravity (CG); it is also  called the roll axis. The longitudinal axis is not necessarily a  ﬁ  xed line through the carriage because the roll axis changes  for different ﬂ  ight conﬁ  gurations, but can be approximated  by the middle of the propeller shaft for a properly designed  WSC aircraft and is typically parallel with the ﬂ  ightpath of  the aircraft as shown in  Figure 2-7.  Angle of incidence is  the angle formed by the root chord line of the wing and the  longitudinal axis of the WSC aircraft.

Figure 2-7.  Angle of incidence.  

Unlike that of an airplane, the WSC angle of incidence has a  signiﬁ  cant change in ﬂ  ight because the carriage is attached to  the wing, which allows the wing to rotate around the carriage  hang point on the wing and is controlled by the pilot as shown  in  Figure 2-7.  

Pitch angle is the angle the WSC wing root chord (center  of wing) makes with the Earth’s horizontal plane. Many  pilots confuse the pitch angle, which is easily seen and felt,  with the   angle of attack (AOA) which is not as perceptible.  For example, if ﬂ  ying in a glide with the engine idle and  the nose lowered, the pitch angle can be below the horizon.  Another example would be ﬂ  ying at full power climb with  the nose raised, resulting in the pitch angle being well above  the horizon.  [Figure 2-8]  Pitch angles are covered in greater  detail in chapter 6.  

Deck angle is the angle of the cart’s wheel axles to the landing  surfaces, as in the powered parachute (PPC) deck angle.  Relative wind is the direction of the airﬂ  ow with respect to  the wing; it is parallel to and opposite the WSC ﬂ  ightpath.  Relative wind may be affected by movement of the WSC  through the air, as well as by all forms of unstable, disturbed  air such as wind shear, thermals, and turbulence. When a  

![](images/fa1dd1269cf014c3c3b502ffa398bad07e0f6d984e3e0326ad284b1f2ecb85d1.jpg)  
Figure 2-8.  Pitch angle examples of nose high (top) and nose low  (bottom).  

WSC is ﬂ  ying through undisturbed air, the relative wind is  parallel to and opposite the ﬂ  ightpath.  [Figure 2-7]  

AOA is the angle between the relative wind and the wing  chord line. Because of the wing twist, the AOA is greatest  at the wing root and decreases along the wing span to the  tips. This is an important concept covered in the stability  section of this chapter. For changing speeds during gliding,  level ﬂ  ight, and climbs, AOA is the primary control for speed  changes. Lower angles of attack produce higher speeds, and  higher angles of attack result in slower speeds.  

The pilot changes the AOA by moving the control  bar forward for high angles of attack and slow speeds  as shown in  Figure 2-7  (top)   for high angle of incidence and  Figure 2-8  (top) for high pitch angle. Low angles of attack for  fast speeds are shown in  Figure 2-7  (bottom) for low angle of  incidence and  Figure 2-8  (bottom) for low pitch angle.  

Most of the time, the pilot is ﬂ  ying at the cruise AOA,  which is the trim position of the control bar, and the pilot is  neither pushing out nor pulling in on the control bar. This  trim position is the AOA and speed the aircraft ﬂ  ies if the  pilot is ﬂ  ying straight and releases the control bar in calm  air.  [Figure 2-9,  middle ]  

Planform is the shape or form of a wing as viewed from  above. The WSC wing comes in a number of planforms  ranging from the larger and slower wings to the smaller and  faster wings.  

Aspect ratio is the wingspan divided by the average chord  line. A WSC aircraft with a common 200 square foot training  wing (about a 35 foot wingspan), and with a typical mean  chord line of 7 feet, would have an average aspect ratio of 5.  This relatively low aspect ratio is less efﬁ  cient at producing  lift. A higher performance wing with 140 square feet, a 35  foot wing span, and an average 5 foot average chord would  have an aspect ratio of 7. The WSC wing is similar to airplane  wings in that the aspect ratio differs with the speciﬁ  c design  

![](images/1c9d06f3f59e9819196eacc8924d3a4585be60c5d0dc6fe23aa13efa2d11382d.jpg)

mission for the aircraft. For the same wing area and similar  design, the lower aspect ratio wings produce less lift and  more drag; higher aspect ratio wings produce more lift, less  drag, and may require more pilot effort to ﬂ  y, depending on  the design.  [Figure 2-10]  

![](images/e05ebb7cec8530043d04fc666301327659a4243030ee2a392d4b13a06ef19237.jpg)  
Figure 2-10.  Wing planforms showing the slow trainer with a low  aspect ratio and the fast cross-country with a high aspect ratio.  

Wing loading is a term associated with total weight being  carried by the wing in relation to the size of the wing. It is the  amount of load each square foot of the wing must support.  Wing loading is found by dividing the total weight of the  aircraft, in pounds, by the total area of the wing, in square  feet. For example, the wing loading would be 5.0 pounds per  square foot when 1,000 pounds total weight for a two-seat  WSC aircraft with two people is supported by a 200 square  foot wing. If ﬂ  ying the same wing with one person and a  lighter total weight of 500 pounds, the wing loading would  be 2.5 pounds per square foot. In the small, high performance  wing of 140 square feet loaded at 1,000 pounds, wing loading  would be 7.1 pounds per square foot.  

Gliding ﬂ  ight is ﬂ  ying in a descent with the engine at idle  or shut off. For example, use a glide ratio of 5, which is ﬁ  ve  feet traveled horizontally for every foot descended vertically.  Glide ratios vary signiﬁ  cantly between models.  

# WSC   Wing Flexibility  

The WSC wing retains its rigid airfoil shape due to rigid  preformed ribs called battens, which are inserted from the  root to the tip along the span of the wing (similar to ribs  for an airplane wing) and a piece of foam or mylar running  along the top side of the leading edge to the high point, which  maintains its front part of the airfoil shape in between the  battens.  [Figure 2-11]  

![](images/0fd373db743dd0af3858705fd6d0624af928daaaac090beb077963c4a2a39487.jpg)  
Figure 2-11.   Rigid airfoil preformed ribs called battens and leading  edge stiffener maintain the rigid airfoil shape.  

Some WSC double surface wing designs use a rib similar  to a PPC wing that attaches to the lower surface and the  upper surface to maintain the wing camber in addition to  the battens.  

Even though the airfoil sections are rigid, the WSC aircraft is  called a “  ﬂ  ex wing” for two reasons. First, it is designed so  the outboard leading edges ﬂ  ex up and back when loaded. The  ﬂ  exing of the outboard section of the wing also allows load  relief because the tips increase twist and decrease AOA—the  greater the weight, the greater the ﬂ  ex and wing twist. This  ﬂ  exing allows the WSC aircraft to automatically reduce loads  in unstable air, providing a smoother ride than a rigid wing.  Since the wing ﬂ  exes and reduces the load for a given angle  of attack at the root chord, WSC aircraft cannot obtain loads  as high as those obtained by a rigid wing. This ﬂ  exing of the  outboard leading edges also assists in initiating a turn.  

Second, the wing is designed to ﬂ  ex as it changes twist from  side to side for turning, historically known as wing warping.  WSC wing warping is similar to what the Wright Brothers  did on their early aircraft, but they did it with wires warping  the wing. The WSC aircraft uses no wires and warps the  wing by shifting the weight, which is covered in Chapter 3,  Components and Systems.  

This ﬂ  exibility is designed into the wing primarily for turning  the aircraft without any movable control surfaces like the  ailerons and rudder on an airplane.  

# Forces in Flight  

The four forces that affect WSC ﬂ  ight are thrust, drag, lift,  and weight.  [Figure 2-12]  In level, steady WSC ﬂ  ight:  

1.  The sum of all upward forces equals the sum of all  downward forces. 2.  The sum of all forward forces equals the sum of all  backward forces. 3.  The sum of all moments equals zero.  

Note that the lift and weight forces are much greater than  the thrust and drag forces. A typical example for many  WSC aircraft is that the lift/weight forces are ﬁ  ve times the  thrust/drag forces.  

![](images/146e1883aff3b2e59745fa1aebddf6d3729fbaed11646b1ad4bf79987a52878b.jpg)  
Figure 2-12.  The four basic forces in level ﬂ  ight.  

Thrust—the forward force produced by a powerplant/propeller  as it forces a mass of air to the rear (usually acts parallel to  the longitudinal axis, relative wind, and ﬂ  ightpath).  

Drag—the aerodynamic force acting on the wing and carriage  in the same plane and in the same direction as the relative  wind.  

Lift—the aerodynamic force caused by air ﬂ  owing over the  wing that is perpendicular to the relative wind.  

Weight—the force of gravity acting upon a body straight  down and perpendicular to the Earth.  

During level ﬂ  ight, these forces are all horizontal and vertical.  During descents or climbing, these forces must be broken  down into components for analysis.  

# Dynamic Pressure (q)  

Both lift and drag are a direct result of the dynamic pressure  of the air. Dynamic pressure ( q ) is created from the velocity  of the air and the air density. An increase in velocity has a  dramatic effect on dynamic pressure ( q ) because it increases  with the square of the velocity. Doubling the velocity means  “ q ” increases by four times. Increasing the velocity by a  factor of three means that the dynamic pressure ( q ) increases  by a factor of nine. This is a very important concept in  understanding the aerodynamics of WSC.  

Formula for dynamic pressure:   ${\mathsf{q}}={\mathsf{V}}^{2}\times{\mathsf{p}}/2$   $\mathrm{V}=$  velocity   $\uprho=$   density factor  

# Lift  

Lift opposes the downward force of weight and is produced  by the dynamic effects of the surrounding airstream acting  on the wing. Lift acts perpendicular to the ﬂ  ightpath through  the wing’s center of lift. There is a mathematical relationship  for lift which varies with dynamic pressure ( q ), AOA, and the  size of the wing. In the lift equation, these factors correspond  to the terms  q , coefﬁ  cient of lift   $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}})$  , and wing surface area.  The relationship is expressed in  Figure 2-13 .  

$$
\mathsf{L}=\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{L}}\mathsf{V}^{2}\frac{\rho}{2}\mathsf{S}
$$  

#  $\mathsf{L}=$  = Lift (pounds)  

$\mathtt{c}_{\mathtt{L}}{=}$  = Coefficient of lift  

(This dimensionless number is the ratio of lift     pressure to dynamic pressure and area. It is     specific to a particular airfoil shape and, above     the stall, it is proportional to angle of attack.)  $\mathsf{v}=$  = Velocity  (feet per second)  $\pmb{\rho}_{=}$  = Air density  (slugs per cubic foot)  $\mathbf{s}=$  = Wing surface area  (square feet)  

# Figure 2-13.  The lift equation.  

Figure 2-13  shows that for lift to increase, one or more of  the factors on the other side of the equation must increase.  Generally, the lift needed is about the same for most ﬂ  ight  situations. A slower speed requires a higher AOA to produce  the same amount of lift. A faster speed requires a lower AOA  to produce the same amount of lift.  

Because lift is a function of dynamic pressure ( q ), it is  proportional to the square of the airspeed; therefore, small  changes in airspeed create larger changes in lift. Likewise, if  other factors remain the same while the  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   increases, lift also  increases. The   $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}}$   goes up as the AOA is increased. As air  density increases, lift increases. However, a pilot is usually  more concerned with how lift is diminished by reductions in  air density on a hot day, or if operating at higher altitudes.  

All wings produce lift in two ways:  

1.  Airfoil shape creates a higher velocity over the top of  the wing and a lower velocity over the bottom of the  wing with Bernoulli’s venturi effect. 2.  Downward deflection of airflow because of the  curvature of the wing with the principle of Newton’s  Third Law of Motion: for every action, there is an  equal and opposite reaction.  

Both principles determine the lifting force. Review the  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge to understand  Newton’s laws of motion and Bernoulli’s venturi effect.  

Figure 2-14  (top) shows the amount of lift produced along  the wing for an airplane wing with an elliptical planform.  Notice how the amount of lift generated is smallest at the  tips and increases slightly towards the root of the wing. This  is known as the “elliptical lift distribution.”  

![](images/4b1943e9119762eb7edd7faf5c8a155cbaad42302de064db5fbe7fcfeb80b182.jpg)  
Figure 2-14.   Elliptical lift distribution compared to lift distribution  of a WSC wing.  

The WSC wing lift distribution is different because the wing  twist at the root is at a higher AOA than the tips. Most of  the lift is produced at the center of the wing with less lift  produced at the tips. The WSC lift distribution is compared  to the lift distribution for an optimum design elliptical wing  in  Figure 2-14.  

# Drag  

Drag is the resistance to forward motion through the air and  is parallel to the relative wind. Aerodynamic drag comes in  two forms:  

1.    Induced drag—a result of the wing producing lift. 2.    Parasite drag—resistance to the airﬂ  ow from the  carriage, its occupants, wires, the wing, interference  drag from objects in the airstream, and skin friction  drag of the wing.  

Induced drag is the result of lift, and its amount varies as  discussed above for lift. Induced drag creates organized  circular vortices off the wingtips that generally track down  and out from each wingtip. Refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge for additional discussion on wingtip  vortices formation.  

These wingtip vortex formations are typical for all aircraft  that use wings including WSC, PPC, helicopters, sailplanes,  and all ﬁ  xed-wing airplanes. The bigger and heavier the  aircraft, the greater and more powerful the wingtip vortices  are. This organized swirling turbulence is an important  factor to understand and avoid for ﬂ  ight safety. Refer to  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) or the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25)  for additional discussion.  

Parasite drag is caused by the friction of air moving over  all the components of the aircraft. Just as with lift, parasite  drag increases as the surface area of the aircraft increases,  and dramatically increases as airspeed increases (the square  of the velocity). Therefore, doubling the airspeed quadruples  parasite drag.  [Figure 2-15]  

![](images/d889cfa74c5941069c32e974d51564a037a4f512e7a3686404a343a97538fa93.jpg)  
Figure 2-15.  Front view with projected area shown that produces  drag.  

The WSC aircraft can be designed for the purpose of being  a slow ﬂ  ying aircraft with a large wing where drag is not a  major concern, or can be designed to be a fast ﬂ  ying aircraft  with a small wing where drag is more of a concern.  

The aircraft has plenty of items (area) for the wind to  strike including wing, wires, struts, pilot, carriage, engine,  wheels, tubes, fuel tanks, etc. Parasitic drag can be reduced  by streamlining the items. Round tubes can be streamlined  reducing the drag to one-third, and cowlings can be used  to streamline the pilot and the carriage completely, but not  without the additional expense and additional weight of the  streamlining. Streamlining does make a noticeable difference  in the speed and gas mileage of the WSC, especially for the  faster aircraft.  [Figure 2-16]  

With the large speed range of WSC aircraft, weight,  complexity, amount and expense of streamlining, and  resultant drag reduction are determined by the specific  mission for the aircraft and the manufacturers’ make and  model.  [Figure 2-17]  

Total drag is the combination of parasite and induced drag.  Total drag  $=$   parasitic drag  $^+$   induced drag  

To help explain the force of drag, the mathematical equation   $\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{D}}\times{\mathfrak{q}}\times\mathrm{S}$   is used. The formula for drag is the same as  the formula for lift, except the  $\mathrm{C_{D}}$   is used instead of the  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}}$  .  In this equation, drag (D) is the product of the coefﬁ  cient of  drag   $(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{D}})$  , dynamic pressure ( q ) determined by the velocity  squared times the air density factor, and surface area (S) of  the carriage and wing. The overall drag coefﬁ  cient is the ratio  of drag pressure to dynamic pressure.  

Induced and parasitic drag have opposite effects as AOA  decreases and speed increases. Note the total drag in  Figure 2-18 . It is high at the slowest air speeds at high angles  of attack near the stall, decreases to the lowest at the most  efﬁ  cient airspeed, and then progressively increases as the  speed increases. The WSC wing can ﬂ  y with a large range  of airspeeds.  

Generally, the most efﬁ  cient speed is at the lowest total  drag providing the best rate of climb, glide ratio, and cruise  economy. However, slower speeds provide higher angles  of climb, and faster speeds provide quicker transportation.  [Figure 2-18]

# Weight  

Weight is a measure of the force of gravity acting upon the  mass of the WSC aircraft. Weight consists of everything  directly associated with the WSC aircraft in flight: the  combined load of the total WSC aircraft (wing, wires, engine,  carriage, fuel, oil, people, clothing, helmets, baggage, charts,  books, checklists, pencils, handheld global positioning  system (GPS), spare clothes, suitcase, etc.).  

During gliding flight, weight is broken down into two  components. The component that opposes the lift, acting  perpendicular to ﬂ  ight/glide path, and the component that  opposes the drag and acts in the direction of the ﬂ  ight/glide  path. During gliding ﬂ  ight, this component of weight is the  weight component providing the forward force which some  call thrust for gliding ﬂ  ight.  

During gliding, straight, and descending in unaccelerated  ﬂ  ight:  

Lift (L) and Drag (D) components  $=$  Resultant force (RF)   $=$   Weight (W)  

Total Drag   $(\mathrm{{D}_{\mathrm{{T}}})=}$  Weight component   $(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{D}})$   in the direction  of ﬂ  ight  

Lift   $\mathbf{(L)}=$  Weight component   $(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{L}})$   that opposes lift  

Similar to airplanes, gliders, and PPC during gliding ﬂ  ight,  less lift is required because the resultant force composed of  lift and drag provides the force to lift the weight. In other  words, in gliding ﬂ  ight, drag helps support the weight.  [Figure 2-19]  

# Thrust  

At a constant air speed, the amount of thrust determines  whether an aircraft climbs, ﬂ  ies level, or descends. With the  engine idle or shut off, a pilot is descending or gliding down.  Maintaining a constant airspeed, when enough thrust is added  

![](images/7f4f070cb99071afba14415e58fa89439db67086206e994477777727837d495c.jpg)  
Figure 2-19.  Typical forces in gliding flight with no engine thrust.  

to produce level ﬂ  ight, the relative wind stream becomes  horizontal with the Earth and the AOA remains about the  same. As described for the airplane in the Pilot’s Handbook  of Aeronautical Knowledge, thrust equals total drag for level  ﬂ  ight.  [Figure 2-20]  

When in straight and level, unaccelerated ﬂ  ight:  

$$
{\mathrm{Lift}}\left({\mathrm{L}}\right)={\mathrm{Weibht}}\left({\mathrm{W}}\right)
$$  

$$
\mathrm{Thurst=Total\Drag\,(D_{T}}
$$  

At a constant airspeed, when excess thrust is added to produce  climbing ﬂ  ight, the relative air stream becomes an inclined  plane leading upward while AOA remains about the same.  The excess thrust determines the climb rate and climb angle  of the ﬂ  ightpath.  [Figure 2-21]  

When in straight and climbing, unaccelerated ﬂ  ight:

Figure 2-21.   Typical forces in climbing flight.  

AOA is the primary control of increasing and decreasing  speeds, and increasing thrust generally does not produce  higher speeds, but additional thrust is required to maintain  level ﬂ  ight at higher speeds.  

# Ground Effect  

Ground effect is when the wing is ﬂ  ying close to the ground  and there is interference of the ground with the airﬂ  ow  patterns created by the wing. At the same angle of attack,  lift increases slightly and the drag decreases signiﬁ  cantly.  The most apparent indication from ground effect is the  unexpected lift given to an aircraft as it ﬂ  ies close to the  ground—normally during takeoffs and landings. More details  for ground effect aerodynamics are found in the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge. Flight characteristics  for ground effect are covered in the takeoff and landing  chapters.  

# Center of Gravity (CG)  

The CG is the theoretical point of concentrated weight of  the aircraft. It is the point within the WSC aircraft about  which all the moments trying to rotate it during ﬂ  ight are  balanced. The most obvious difference in the CG for a WSC  aircraft is the vertical position compared to an airplane, as  it is always lower than the wing. The Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge accurately states the CG is generally  in the vertical center of the fuselage. The same is true for the  WSC aircraft. However, the WSC wing is higher above the  fuselage/carriage and, since most of the weight is centered  in the carriage, the CG is well below the wing.  

In a two-seat WSC aircraft, the second seat is typically behind  the pilot’s seat and the CG is usually located close to the rear  passenger seat. Therefore, the CG location does not change  signiﬁ  cantly with a passenger. Fuel tanks are typically located  near the vertical CG so any difference in fuel quantity does  not signiﬁ  cantly change the CG fore and aft with different  fuel quantities.  

For level ﬂ  ight, the CG is directly below the wing/carriage  attachment point known as the hang point, and the propeller  thrust line is typically designed to be near the vertical position  of the CG.  [Figure 2-22]  

# Thrust Required for Increases in Speed  

Above the lowest total drag airspeed  [Figure 2-18],  faster  speeds (lower angles of attack) for level and climbing ﬂ  ight  requires greater thrust because of the increased drag created  from the faster speeds.

# Axes of Rotation  

The three axes of rotation intersect at the CG.  [Figure 2-23]  

# Lateral Axis— Pitch  

Motion about the lateral axis, or pitch, is controlled by AOA/ speed and the throttle. Lowering the AOA (increasing speed)  

rotates the nose down while increasing the AOA (decreasing  speed) rotates the nose up.  

Increasing the thrust of the propeller rotates the WSC aircraft  pitch up (nose up) to climb and pitch down (nose down) at  reduced throttle.

Figure 2-23.   Axes of rotation.  

# Longitudinal Axis—  Roll  

Turning is initiated by rolling about the longitudinal axis, into  a bank similar to an airplane using aileron and rudder control.  To turn, shift the weight to the side in the direction of the turn,  increasing the weight on that side. This increases the twist on  that side while decreasing the twist on the other side, similar  to actuating the ailerons on an airplane. The increased twist  on the side with the increased weight reduces the AOA on the  tip, reducing the lift on that side and dropping the wing into a  bank. The other wing, away from which the weight has been  shifted, decreases twist. The AOA increases, increasing the  lift on that wing and thereby raising it.  

Thus, shifting the weight to one side warps the wing (changes  the twist) to drop one wing and raise the other, rolling the  WSC aircraft about the longitudinal axis.  [Figure 2-24]  More  details on the controls that assist wing warping are covered  in chapter 3, which should be considered with use of the  controls in the takeoff, landing, and ﬂ  ight maneuvers sections  of this handbook.  

![](images/6cfa6897b0b6adf9089d64ff2196f9d1f7a74ac736126212329e33e78b98c68f.jpg)  
Figure 2-24.   Shifting weight to one side warps the wing by  increasing the twist on the loaded side and decreasing the twist on  the unloaded side.  

# Vertical Axis—  Yaw  

The WSC wing is designed to ﬂ  y directly into the relative  wind because it does not provide for direct control of rotation  about the vertical axis.  

# Stability and Moments  

A body that rotates freely turns about its CG. In aerodynamic  terms for a WSC aircraft, the mathematical value of a moment  is the product of the force times the distance from the CG  (moment arm) at which the force is applied.  

Typical airplane wings generally pitch nose down or roll  forward and follow the curvature of the upper airfoil camber  creating a negative pitching moment. One of the reasons  airplanes have tails is to create a downward force at the  rear of the aircraft to maintain stabilized ﬂ  ight, as explained  in greater detail in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge.  

The WSC wing is completely different and does not need a  tail because of two speciﬁ  c design differences—a completely  different airfoil design creating a more stable airfoil and  lifting surfaces fore and aft of the CG, similar to the airplane  canard design.  

# WSC   Unique Airfoil and Wing Design  

As shown in  Figure 2-2,  the WSC airfoil has the high point  signiﬁ  cantly farther forward than does the typical airplane  airfoil. This makes the center of lift for the airfoil farther  forward and creates a neutral or positive pitching moment  for the airfoil. Most WSC airfoils have this unique design to  minimize negative moments or pitch down during ﬂ  ight.  

Additionally, the design of the complete wing is a unique  feature that provides stability without a tail. To understand the  WSC aircraft pitch stability and moments, examine the wing  as two separate components—root chord and tip chord.  

# Trim—Normal Stabilized Flight  

In  Figure 2-25A,  during normal unaccelerated ﬂ  ight at trim  speed, the lift at the root   $(\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{R}})$   times the arm to the root   $(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{{R}}})$    equals the lift of the tip   $(\mathbf{L}_{\mathrm{T}})$   times the arm to the tip   $(\mathbf{A}_{\mathrm{T}})$  .  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{(L_{R}\times\Delta A_{R})+(L_{T}\times\Delta A_{T})=0~}}\\ {\mathrm{L_{R}+L_{T}=T o t a l\;L i f t\;o f\;t h e\;W i n g\;(L_{W})}}\end{array}
$$  

Adding all the lift from the wing puts the center of lift of  the wing (CLW) directly over the CG for stabilized ﬂ  ight.  [Figure 2-25A]  If the pilot wishes to increase the trim speed,  the CG is moved forward. This is done by moving the hang  point forward on the wing. Similarly, to reduce the trim speed,  the hang point/CG is moved rearward on the wing.  

# High Angles of Attack  

In  Figure 2-25B,  if the wing AOA is raised to the point of  minimum controlled airspeed at which the wing begins to  stall towards the center of the wing (root area), the lift in this  area decreases dramatically. The CLW moves back a distance  “b” creating a moment to lower the nose. Therefore, the  center of lift moves behind the CG at higher angles of attack,  creating a nose-down stabilizing moment. The average lift  coefﬁ  cient verses AOA is shown for this minimum controlled  airspeed in  Figure 2-26.  The root area is partially stalled and  

![](images/a18c0a172c89be72b96d163e511007bfb6c7bbb16df888d80df51cbf9fe73a9d.jpg)  
Figure 2-25.   Trim, minimum controlled airspeed, and high speed pitching moments.  

the tips are still ﬂ  ying. The speciﬁ  c stall characteristics of  each wing are different and this stall pattern shown here is  used for example.  

# Low Angles of Attack  

At very low AOA, the tip chords are near zero AOA or below,  not producing any lift, as shown in  Figure 2-25C . At this  point, the nose area is producing all of the lift for the wing.  The CLW moves forward a distance “c,” creating a positive  stabilizing moment to raise the nose.  

# Pitch Pressures  

As the pilot pushes out on the control bar, this creates a pilot  input force that has a moment arm from the control bar up to  the wing hang point.  [Figure 2-27]  

From this pilot-induced pitch moment, the control bar is  pushed out, the nose raised, and the AOA increases an equal  amount for both the root and the tip chords. However, as  shown in  Figures 2-26  and  2-28,  the average  $\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{{L}}}$   change is  greater at the low AOA at the tip chords, while the amount  

![](images/af95b4c1c3fc3f9bef1740fc70f077ba42ecb7e78ba0daca21ad0b140fbac71a.jpg)

Figure 2-27.   Pilot actuated pitching moment.  

of change of the  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$   is much less at higher AOA at the root  chord. Therefore, an increase in AOA for the wing results in  the tips creating a greater proportion of the lift and moving  the center of lift behind the CG, creating a negative pitching  moment to lower the nose at high AOA.  

![](images/f7d763a5d32f91589d9cc5c3b6e351e4335f56479127c912e018454dec9cee13.jpg)  
Figure 2-28.   Example   AOA versus  $C_{L}$   showing the wing increasing  AOA three degrees with the tip  $C_{L}$   increasing more than the root.  

Based on the same principle, when the wing AOA is lowered  below the trim position, the tip chords’  $\mathrm{C_{L}}$    decreases more  than the root chord and the center of lift for the wing moves  forward creating a positive moment to raise the nose at  lower AOA.  

In situations where the pilot is ﬂ  ying in severe/extreme  turbulence, wind sheer, or the pilot is exceeding the limitations  of the aircraft, the WSC aircraft can get into a situation where  the root chord is at a negative AOA and not producing lift.  This could result in an emergency vertical dive situation, as  discussed later in the Whip Stall-Tuck-Tumble section. When  at very low angles or negative angles of attack, the WSC wing  is designed so that the wing has positive stability or a nose- up aerodynamic moment. This is accomplished by a number  of different systems (washout struts, sprogs and reﬂ  ex lines)  further explained in chapter 3 that simply keep the trailing  edge of the wing up in an emergency low/negative AOA  dive situation. As shown in  Figure 2-29,  the root area of the  wing has reﬂ  ex which creates a positive pitching moment  for the root chord to rotate the nose up towards a level ﬂ  ying  attitude. At the same time, the tips are at a negative AOA  producing lift in the opposite direction as usual, creating a  moment to bring the nose/root chord up to a positive AOA  to start producing lift and raising the nose to a normal ﬂ  ight  condition. The negative lift or downward force as produced  at the tips and root as shown provide a positive moment to  raise the nose back to a normal ﬂ  ying attitude.  

![](images/2190c1d72c05781fa8ccabd84a7967eccbd4a57c5704ebd0c4b1dbe8c3c759d0.jpg)  
Figure 2-29.   Emergency vertical dive recovery for a WSC wing.  

Reﬂ  ex also provides a stable pitch up moment for an airfoil  when it is ﬂ  ying at normal ﬂ  ight angles of attack. The greater  the reﬂ  ex, the greater the nose up moment of the airfoil. This  is used in some WSC airfoil designs and also for trim control  as discussed in Chapter 3.  

# Carriage Moments  

The wing design is the main contributing factor for pitch  stability and moments, but the carriage design can also  inﬂ  uence the pitching moment of the WSC aircraft. For  example, at very high speeds in a dive, a streamlined carriage  would have less drag and, therefore, a greater nose-up moment  because of less drag. The design of the carriage parts can have  an effect on aerodynamic forces on the carriage, resulting in  different moments for different carriage designs.  

The drag of the wing in combination with the drag of the  carriage at various airspeeds provides a number of pitching  moments, which are tested by the manufacturer—a reason  the carriage is matched to the wing for compatibility. Each  manufacturer designs the carriage to match the wing and takes  into account these unique factors.  

# Pitch Moments Summary  

Overall, the amount of sweep, twist, speciﬁ  c airfoil design  from root to the tip, and the carriage design determine the  pitching moments of the WSC aircraft. Some have small  pitching moments, some have greater pitching moments.  Each WSC model is different with a balance of these  aerodynamic parameters to accomplish the speciﬁ  c mission  for each unique carriage and wing combination.  

# Roll Stability and Moments  

As described in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge, more dihedral or less anhedral in a WSC wing  creates more roll stability. More roll stability might be helpful  for a training wing or a fast wing made for long cross-country  straight ﬂ  ight, but most pilots want a balance between roll  stability and the ability to make quicker turns and a sport  car feel for banking/turning. Therefore, a balance between  the stability and the instability is achieved through anhedral  plus other important wing design features such as nose angle,  twist, and airfoil shape from root to tip.  

An aerodynamic characteristic of swept wings is an “effective  dihedral” based on the sweep of the wing and angle of attack.  The combination of the physical anhedral in the wing and the  effective dihedral due to wing sweep provides the balance of  stability and rolling moments for a particular wing design.  

The design of the wing can have actual dihedral or anhedral in  the wing. Even with anhedral designed in the inboard section  of the wing, the outboard sections of the wing could have  some dihedral because of the ﬂ  ex in the outboard leading  edges. As the wing is loaded up from additional weight or  during a turn, the tips ﬂ  ex up more creating more dihedral  and a roll stabilizing effect when loaded.  [Figure 2-30]  

![](images/c3532e01b6533c1623e0fb34b704c961528c5bea11656f8c050873d6e296c02d.jpg)  
Figure 2-30.   Wing front view example showing anhedral in the  middle of the wing and dihedral at the outboard section of the wing  because of leading edge flex.  

Generally, it is thought that the wing remains level and the  weight shifts to the side to initiate a turn. Another way to  look at how the WSC wing rolls is to examine the carriage  and the wing moment from the carriage point of view. For  example, the CG hangs far below a wing weighing   $\%$   of  the carriage weight. When the control bar is moved to the  side, creating a moment about the carriage/wing hang point,  the carriage stays vertical and the wing rotates around the  carriage. Therefore, there are two rolling moments that both  contribute to the WSC rolling into a bank:  

•  The pilot creating the force on the control bar rotating  the wing about the wing/carriage hang point.  

•  Shifting weight to one side of the wing, thus warping  the wing to aerodynamically change the lift on each  side, as in airplane roll control.  [Figure 2-31]  

![](images/3d009f56c92c4b7facf2dced00af55ce9d58ed2cb8e4c840a436892ebe4bf91d.jpg)  
Figure 2-31.   Pilot induced moments about wing/carriage hang point  and resultant CG rolling moment.  

# Carriage Moments  

Carriage weight and resultant CG are the main factors that  contribute toward increasing the roll moment for the carriage.  Carriage aerodynamic forces are not typically a factor for  rolling moments.  

# Roll Stability Summary  

Overall, roll stability and moments are a manufacturer/ make/model balance between dihedral/anhedral, wing twist,  nose angle, airfoil shape from root to tip, and leading edge  stiffness. Some designs are stable, others neutral, and others  can be designed to be slightly unstable for quick side-to-side  rolling.  

# Yaw Stability and Moments  

There is no signiﬁ  cant turning about the vertical axis because  the WSC wing is designed to ﬂ  y directly into the relative  wind. Any sideways skidding or yaw is automatically  corrected to ﬂ  y straight with the swept wing design. An  airplane uses the vertical tail to stabilize it to ﬂ  y directly into  the relative wind like a dart. The unique design of the WSC  aircraft performs the same function through the swept wing  design, but also the wing twist and airfoil shape from root to  tip assists in the correction about the vertical axis. A simple  way to understand the yaw stability is to see that any yawing  motion is reduced simply through the increased area of the  wing as it rotates about its vertical axis.  [Figure 2-32]  

There is a slight amount of adverse yaw similar to an  airplane that can be noticed when a roll is ﬁ  rst initiated.  The amount varies with the speciﬁ  c manufacturer’s design  and make/model. In addition, the wing can yaw side to side  to some degree, with some different manufacturer’s make/  

![](images/f4cbb8aa964531de6174be2f6f917e03408406226c13904c5bd250312af506cc.jpg)

model more than others. The higher performance wings  with less twist and a greater nose angle are noted for less  yaw stability to gain performance. These wings also require  more pilot input and skill to minimize yaw instability through  pitch input. An addition to the wing planform, twist, and  airfoil shapes to minimize yaw, some wings utilize vertical  stabilizers similar to these in airplanes and others use tip ﬁ  ns.  [Figure 2-33]  Generally, the WSC wing is yaw stable with  minor variations that are different for each wing and can be  controlled by pilot input, if needed.  

![](images/2751b4bca8c17b7bd90463fe0116d75f9cfb5694f3599a58f72a6d24cb989756.jpg)  
Figure 2-33.   Keel pockets and vertical stabilizers are additional  tools designers use for yaw stability on the wing.  

# Carriage Moments  

The wing is a signiﬁ  cant factor in the design of yaw stability,  but the carriage can be a large factor also. If the area in front  of the CG is greater than the area in back of the CG, and  the wing yaws to the side, then the front would have more  drag and create a moment to yaw the WSC aircraft further  from the straight ﬂ  ight. Therefore, ﬁ  ns are sometimes put  on the carriage as needed so the carriage also has a yawing  aerodynamic force to track the WSC aircraft directly into the  wind.  [Figure 2-34]  

![](images/f7e28d81f5529f536fa6cd341d424529ddcf3d27532cd7d9ae63e9829a6d0efd.jpg)  

Since the carriage has such a large effect on yaw stability,  the carriage is matched to the wing for overall compatibility.  Each manufacturer designs the carriage to match the wing and  takes into account these unique factors of each design.  

# Yaw Stability Summary  

These factors make the WSC aircraft track directly into  the relative wind and eliminate the need for a rudder to  make coordinated turns. Designs and methods vary with  manufacturer and wing type, but all WSC wings are designed  to track directly into the relative wind.  

# Thrust Moments  

WSC aircraft designs can have different moments caused by  thrust based on where the thrust line is compared to the CG.  This is similar to an airplane except the WSC aircraft has no  horizontal stabilizer that is affected by propeller blast.  

If the propeller thrust is below the CG  [Figure 2-35,  top ] ,  this creates a pitch-up moment about the CG when thrust is  applied and a resultant decrease in speed. When reducing  the throttle, it reduces this moment and a nose pitch down  results with an increase in speed.  

![](images/e0c796961eba92a4e0d1977620dbf8d7c7d14d7ff2094201930e8293e2e56685.jpg)  
Figure 2-35.   Thrust line moments.  

If the propeller thrust is above the CG  [Figure 2-35,  bottom ] ,  this creates a pitch-down moment about the CG when thrust  is applied and a resultant increase in speed. When reducing  the throttle, it reduces this moment and a nose pitch up results  with a decrease in speed.  

With the thrust line above or below the CG producing these  minor pitch and speed changes, they are usually minor for  most popular designs. Larger thrust moments about the CG  may require pilot input to minimize the pitch and speed  effects. Most manufacturers strive to keep the thrust as close  as possible to the vertical CG while also balancing the drag of  the carriage and the wing for its speed range. This is why the  carriage must be matched to the wing so these characteristics  provide a safe and easy to ﬂ  y WSC aircraft.  

# Stalls: Exceeding the Critical AOA  

As the AOA increases to large values on the wing chord,  the air separates starting at the back of the airfoil. As the  AOA increases, the separated air moves forward towards the  leading edge. The critical AOA is the point at which the wing  is totally stalled, producing no lift—regardless of airspeed,  ﬂ  ight attitude, or weight.  [Figure 2-36]  

![](images/61d2255610664d3e7e4c63b16c56f248b655eab9b1a1000ef756df783055f2b9.jpg)  
Figure 2-36.   Stall progression for an airfoil chord as the angle of  attack is increased.  

Because the AOA of the WSC wing root chord/nose is so much  higher than the AOA of the tips, the nose stalls before the tips.  It is similar to stalling with the airplane canard in which the  nose stalls ﬁ  rst, the main wing (or tips for the WSC aircraft)  continues to ﬂ  y, and the nose drops due to lack of lift.  

In most normal situations, the root chord/nose stalls ﬁ  rst  because it is at a much higher AOA. The tips continue to ﬂ  y,  making the WSC wing resistant to a complete wing stall. A  pilot can even bring the aircraft into a high pitch angle stall  attitude and keep the nose high. The nose stalls and rotates  down because of the loss of lift, while the tips keep ﬂ  ying  and maintain control of the aircraft.  

If ﬂ  ying within the operating limitations of the aircraft and  the WSC reaches a high AOA, the nose stalls, but the tips  continue ﬂ  ying. However, it must be understood that there are  many wing designs with many types of stall characteristics  for each unique design. For example, high-performance  wings could have less twist to gain performance, which  could cause the wing to stall more abruptly than a training  wing with more twist.  

# Whip Stall–Tuck–Tumble  

A WSC aircraft can get to a high pitch attitude by ﬂ  ying  outside the its limitations or flying in extreme/severe  turbulence. If the wing gets to such a high pitch attitude and  the AOA is high enough that the tips stall, a whip stall occurs.  [Figure 2-37]  

![](images/ac16329c87fd14dd3548837eab35a1d670eb184aa431b4875eb212774bc4d5e3.jpg)  
Figure 2-37.   Whip stall to tumble phases and sequence.  

In a WSC wing, most of the area of the wing is behind the CG  (about three-quarters). With the tips and aft part of the wing  having the greatest drag, and the weight being forward, an  immediate and strong nose-down moment is created and the  WSC nose starts to drop. Since both the relative wind and the  wing are rapidly changing direction, there is no opportunity  to reestablish laminar airﬂ  ow across the wing.  

This rotational momentum can pull the nose down into a  number of increasingly worse situations, depending on the  severity of the whip stall.  Figure 2-37  shows a whip stall and  the phases that can result, depending on the severity.  

Phase 1—Minor whip stall results in a nose-down pitch  attitude at which the nose is at a positive AOA and the  positive stability raises the nose   to normal ﬂ  ight, as  described in  Figure 2-25C .  

Phase 2—If the rotational movement is enough to  produce a vertical dive, as illustrated in  Figure 2-29, the aerodynamic dive recovery might raise the nose  to an attitude to recover from the dive and resume  normal ﬂ  ight condition.  

Phase 3—The rotational momentum is enough to bring  the nose signiﬁ  cantly past vertical (the nose has tucked  under vertical), but could still recover to a vertical dive  and eventually resume a normal ﬂ  ight condition.  

Phase 4—The rotational momentum is severe enough  to continue rotation, bringing the WSC wing into a  tumble from which there is no recovery to normal  ﬂ  ight, and structural damage is probable.  

Avoidance and emergency procedures are covered in Chapter  6, Basic Flight Maneuverers, and Chapter 13, Abnormal and  Emergency Procedures.  

# Weight, Load, and Speed  

Similar to airplanes, sailplanes, and PPCs, increasing weight  creates increases in speed and descent rate. However, the  WSC aircraft has a unique characteristic. Adding weight to  a WSC aircraft creates more twist in the wing because the  outboard leading edges ﬂ  ex more. With less lift at the tips, a  nose-up effect is created and the trim speed lowers.  

Therefore, adding weight can increase speed similar to other  aircraft, but reduce the trim speed because of the increased  twist unique to the WSC aircraft. Each manufacturer’s  make/model has different effects depending on the speciﬁ  c  design. As described in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge, the stall speed increases as the weight or loading  increases so some manufacturers may have speciﬁ  c carriage/ wing hang point locations for different weights. Some require  CG locations to be forward for greater weights so the trim  speed is well above the stall speed for the wing.  

WSC aircraft have the same forces as airplanes during normal  coordinated turns. Greater bank angles result in greater  resultant loads. The ﬂ  ight operating strength of an aircraft  is presented on a graph whose horizontal scale is based on  load factor. The diagram is called a VG diagram—velocity  versus “G” loads or load factor. Each aircraft has its own VG  diagram which is valid at a certain weight and altitude. See  the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for more  details on the VG diagram. Load factors are also similar to  the VG diagram applicable to WSC.  

# Basic Propeller Principles  

The WSC aircraft propeller principles are similar to those  found in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,  except there is no “corkscrewing effect of the slipstream”  and there is less P-factor because the carriage is generally  ﬂ  ying with the thrust line parallel to the relative wind. The  wing acts independently, raising and lowering the AOA and  speed. This was introduced at the beginning of this chapter  when angle of incidence was deﬁ  ned.  

The torque reaction does have a noticeable effect on the WSC  aircraft. With the typical left hand turn tendency (for right  hand turning propellers), turns are not typically built into the  wing. As in airplanes, some cart designs point the engine  down and to the right. Others do not make any adjustment, and  the pilot accounts for the turning effect through pilot input.  

It should be noted that many of the two-stroke propellers turn  to the right, as do conventional airplanes. However, many  four-stroke engine propellers turn to the left, creating a right  hand turn. Consult the POH for the torque characteristics of  your speciﬁ c aircraft.  

# Chapter Summary  

Basic principles of aerodynamics apply to all aircraft;  however, the unique design of the wing and the separate  fuselage/carriage provide a simplistic and efﬁ  cient aircraft.  The following provide a summary of the unique aerodynamics  for the WSC wing:  

•  The WSC wing is pitch stable without a tail because  of the combination of airfoil design from root to tip,  sweep, twist, and planform. •  WSC wing ﬂ  exibility allows the wing to twist from  side to side by shifting the weight providing the control  to roll the aircraft without control surfaces. •  The WSC wing only has two axes of control, pitch  and roll, while no yaw control is needed because it is  yaw stable. •  The WSC wing is stall resistant because under normal  ﬂ  ight conditions the tip chord is still ﬂ  ying while the  rest of the wing is stalled—similar to the airplane  canard system.  

# Chapter 3 Components  and Systems  

Weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft come in an array of shapes  and sizes, but the basic design features are fundamentally the  same. All WSC consist of a ﬂ  exible wing made with a sail  ﬁ  tted over a rigid airframe. A separate carriage is the fuselage  which consists of the ﬂ  ight deck, propulsion system, and  landing gear.  [Figure 3-1]  

![](images/4bd96f134756a322b0be24daa6e3d05365cff0f18a44afec851ce626a7e06ae3.jpg)  
Figure 3-1.   Wing and carriage of WSC aircraft.  

# Wing  

The wing has a structural frame that the sail fits over.  Although the wing structure is rigid, it is designed to move  and allow the sail to ﬂ  ex and the wing to deform or “warp,”  to provide a simple control system with no pulleys, push  rods, hinges, control cables, or separate control surfaces. This  simpliﬁ  es maintenance and reduces the cost and weight of  the wing. Each wing is built from high quality aircraft parts  including alloyed aluminum tubes, stainless steel cables,  hardware, and specially designed sail cloth.  

# Wing Frame Components  

The structural frame of the wing is composed of the leading  edges, keel, crossbar, pilot control frame, king post and wires/ struts. The wing frame is a number of structural triangles  formed by the wing components. These triangles, braced by  wires and struts, provide a strong and lightweight frame to  support the ﬂ  exible sail.  [Figure 3-2]  

# Leading Edges  

Leading edges are tube assemblies that are at the front of the  wing, the leading edges of the wing airfoil. These are swept  back to form the front shape of the wing and attached to each  other with nose plates. The leading edges support the airfoil  and are designed to ﬂ  ex as part of the wing structure.  

The leading edges are each made up of two main  sections, an inboard and an outboard section, as shown in  Figures 3-2  and  3-3 . Additional tubing “sleeves” are typically  used for added strength where the leading edge attaches to  the nose plates, and where the inboard and outboard tubes  join at the crossbar attachment. This sleeving can be internal  or external depending on the speciﬁ  c manufacturer’s design.  Typically, additional sleeving is used throughout the leading  edges at various locations to strengthen and vary the ﬂ  ex for  the particular design of the wing. Each manufacturer and  make/model uses different internal and external sleeving  to accomplish speciﬁ  c strength and ﬂ  ex characteristics.  Generally, the inboard sections are stiffer and the outboard  leading edge section ﬂ  exes as part of the ﬂ  exible wing  design. Sleeving is commonly added throughout the aircraft  where bolt holes are drilled through the tubing to reinforce  it around the bolt hole.  

The outboard leading edge sections can be removed to pack  up the wing into a “short pack” which is commonly used for  shipping.  [Figure 3-3]

# Keel  

The wing keel is like that of a boat keel, the center of the  wing, fore and aft. It attaches to the leading edges at the nose  plate and performs a number of important functions. It is the  structure where the carriage attaches to the wing, and it is the  wing structure that connects the center section of the sail at  the “keel pocket” (discussed later in this chapter in the sail  section). The control frame and king post (if so equipped) also  attaches to the keel. It also provides structure for the upper  and lower wires (if so equipped) and a reference or anchor  The keel is rigid and is not designed to ﬂ  ex nor is it highly  stressed like the leading edges except where the under  carriage attaches to the wing. Sleeving is normally added to  strengthen this middle area as well at the nose attachment  and rear cable attachments.

Figure 3-3.  Leading edge assembly.  

# Crossbar  

The crossbar is two aluminum tube sections hinged above the  keel that attach to the leading edges. The crossbar is tensioned  back with the crossbar tensioning cables, which pushes the  leading edges forward to conform to the sail. These crossbar  tensioning cables are attached at the rear of the keel when the  wing is tensioned into ﬂ  ying position.  [Figure 3-4]  

![](images/2692ef5086a37a1637989e25f34c8fc37f604d66949f8e5898b8bfd7e30c1493.jpg)  
Figure 3-4.  View looking inside left hand wing from the tip showing  crossbar tensioned and pushing the leading edges into the sail.  Notice the slight bending of the leading edges to fit into the sail  (top). Crossbar tensioning cables attached to rear of keel in flying  position detail. See specific location on airframe with figure 3-2.  (bottom).  

These crossbar sections are under a compression load and  designed to be stiff with no bending. A larger diameter tube is  typically used to avoid any bending when the wing is ﬂ  ying.  A ding, dent, or bend in the crossbar could spell disaster  during ﬂ  ight because it is one of the main structural members  that holds leading edges into position during ﬂ  ight.  

For wing take down and packing, the crossbar haul back  cables are released, the crossbar hinged center moves  forward, and the leading edges rotate in toward the keel about  the nose plates and come together, allowing the wing to fold  down into a long tube for transport and/or storage.  

# Control Frame  

The triangle-shaped control frame serves two main purposes.  It provides the lower structure for the wing and is the control  bar for the pilot. The control frame is bolted to the keel  with two downtubes extending from the keel attachment  to the horizontal base tube, which is the pilot’s control bar.  [Figures 3-2, 3-5, and 3-6]  

![](images/ef374340b26e790289ae0cfba564ff5997ac8cb99d41367973f1c973927cb9e1.jpg)  
Figure 3-5.  Control frame corner bracket with wire attachments.  Notice the thick structural   $\mathcal{V}_{8}$  -inch flying wires that support the  wing and smaller   $\mathcal{Y}_{32}$  -inch cables holding the control frame in  place fore and aft.  

![](images/1a35568a811fba740058786d9d2583f435554099316837ae3ede385e1abd4da6.jpg)  
Figure 3-6.  Control frame with downtubes, control bar, and corner  bracket with flying wing wires, and control frame fore and aft  wires.  

Control frame corner brackets at the bottom of the downtubes  provide the wing structural attachments for the ﬂ  ying cables  or struts that attach to each leading edge/crossbar junction,  and secure the control bar fore and aft to the wing with the  front and back wires attached to nose plates and the aft section  of the keel.  [Figures 3-5  and  3-6]  

During ﬂ  ight, the downtubes are similar in compression to the  crossbar and must be stiff and straight to maintain structural  integrity. The base tube/control bar is under tension during  ﬂ  ight.  

Front and rear ﬂ  ying wires hold the control frame in place  fore and aft. Side ﬂ  ying wires hold the control frame in place  side to side and provide structure to hold the wings in place  while ﬂ  ying.  [Figures 3-2, 3-5,  and  3-6]  Strutted wings use  struts in place of the side ﬂ  ying wires, which is discussed  later in this chapter.  

Training bars are added for dual controls so the person in back  can ﬂ  y the aircraft. These are typically used by an instructor  for training but can be used by a passenger in the back also.  [Figure 3-7]  

# King Post With Wires-on-Top Wing Design  

Similar to the lower control frame holding the wing in  position during ﬂ  ight, the king post is attached to the keel  and supports the upper ground wires which hold the wing  in position on the ground and negative loads during ﬂ  ight.  [Figure 3-2]  It also provides a structure for reﬂ  ex lines which  is discussed later in wing systems.  

# Topless Wings With Struts  

Similar to airplanes with struts to support the wings, some  WSC aircraft replace side ﬂ  ying wires with struts, eliminating  the king post and ground wires on top of the wing. This  provides a number of beneﬁ  ts, but primarily, no king post is  needed because the struts can take a compression load and  hold the wings up on the ground and also take the negative  loads during ﬂ  ight. With struts, a WSC aircraft is much shorter  in height allowing it to ﬁ  t into hangars with lower doors and  ceilings. This can make a big difference in ﬁ  nding a suitable  storage for the aircraft if leaving it set up.  [Figure 3-8]  

![](images/b1249bd911d33a6b97046f7a4d9a22a36efa08b8121aab74952c101b95f48bd9.jpg)

Figure 3-7.  Passenger using training bars which are also used by the instructor during training.  

Some strutted designs allow the wings to be folded back while  still on the carriage. This can also be helpful when using a  smaller space for storage by folding the wing up without  taking it off the carriage.  [Figure 3-9]  It is also convenient  for sea trikes since the aircraft does not have to be taken out  of the water to fold up the wing.  

Strutted wings have a clean upper surface with no holes  required for the king post or wires to go through the top  of the sail. This reduces interference drag on the top of the  wing. Increasing overall efﬁ  ciency, no holes in the sail also  eliminates any high pressure leakage from underneath the  wing getting sucked up to the lower pressure on top of the  wing.  [Figure 3-10]  

# Sail Components  

The sail is a highly reﬁ  ned design that integrates with its  wing frame. Each sail and wing frame are designed for each  other and are not interchangeable with other sails or wings.  

![](images/c828c6e5794a8fb0142cafcadf4f30591b9b30e97d2e81dfc181c6cb4c316e86.jpg)  

Modern sails are designed with complex geometry and sewn  to precision to achieve a highly efﬁ  cient design. Because of the  ﬂ  exibility of the wing frame and the modern techniques in sail  design, the leading edge can have a curved shape which adds  to the efﬁ  ciency and stability of the wing.  [Figure 3-11]  

![](images/bfe6431348428ff2334ce00e787a47a5c3cdaf75c90156d853e9c907a72f1f3d.jpg)  
Figure 3-11.   Curved leading edge sail design.  

# Battens and Leading Edge Stiffener  

As discussed in the aerodynamics section, stiff preformed  battens are the airfoil ribs that maintain the airfoil shape from  the root to the tips. Additionally, a foam or mylar stiffener is  inserted in a pocket at the leading edge to keep a rigid airfoil  shape between the battens from the leading edge up to the  airfoil high point. Double surface wings have additional ribs  on the bottom surface that are straight or formed to maintain  the bottom surface camber.  

# Sail Material and Panels  

Sail material is a combination of polyester materials designed  with different weaves, thickness, and orientation to ﬁ  t the  design mission of the wing. Panels are cut to different shapes  and laid down at different angles to provide the stiffness  and ﬂ  exibility where needed for the speciﬁ  c wing design.  Automated machines typically cut the fabric to precision  tolerances and the panels are sewn together with high strength  thread.  

# Pockets and Hardware  

Pockets are added for battens and hardware is installed for  the wing frame and wire attachments. Trailing edge line or  wires are sometimes added for reinforcement and can be used  for tuning. Battens are held in with a variety of batten ties or  other methods unique to the manufacturer.  [Figure 3-12]  

![](images/66882365301991c072189c15bfa610c58c9052c7854d3d644a62fd6f1ea182f1.jpg)

# Figure 3-13.  Keel pocket.  

# Cables and Hardware  

Cables are used throughout the wing frame and sail to hold  components in place and act as structure to carry loads. Flight  and ground cables are stainless steel and attach to components  with tangs or other hardware depending on the application.  Cables are secured at each end with thimbles and swaged  ﬁ  ttings.  Figure 3-5  shows detail of typical swaged ﬁ  ttings.  A variety of hardware is used for attaching these swaged  cable ﬁ  ttings to the airframe. Each manufacturer has different  hardware for wing components.  [Figures 3-14  and  3-15]  

![](images/d27a8002eebc98c80f234f6fadf6e0f686cba53a25dfa2059c4f6125b73b2c15.jpg)  
Figure 3-14.  Crossbar tensioning junction attachment example.  

# Sail Attachment to Wing Frame  

The sail is attached to the wing frame at the nose and the  tips. A keel pocket towards the back of the sail secures the  sail to the wing keel.  [Figure 3-13]  

![](images/a33070f080a5f18453e60815568f798e010ded5fa54cca26f6533e44665c4314.jpg)

# Wing Systems Reﬂ  ex Systems  

As discussed in the aerodynamics section, the trailing edge  near the root and the tips must stay up during unusually low or  negative angles of attack  [Figure 2-29]  to maintain a positive  pitch stability for the aircraft. There are a number of reﬂ  ex  systems used to accomplish this in emergency situations.  

Reﬂ  ex cables—most wings with a king post use cables to  hold the trailing edge up at unusually low or negative angles  of attack. These reﬂ  ex cables are secured to the top of the  king post and attach to several positions on the trailing edge  where the battens are located. Different manufacturers have  different positions where these are attached, depending on  the design of the wing. Reﬂ  ex cables also provide additional  reﬂ  ex at high speeds because the drag of the wires pulls up  the trailing edge, creating more reﬂ  ex at these higher speeds.  [Figure 3-16]  

Washout struts—tubes near the tips that keep the tip trailing  edge up during very low or negative angles of attack. They  can be inside or outside the double surface of a wing. The  reﬂ  ex cables may not go to the wingtip, so washout struts  are used to hold up the trailing edge at the tip at very low  and negative angles of attack.  [Figure 3-17]  

Sprogs—for wings using struts with no king post, sprogs  are used to keep the inboard trailing edge up in place of the  reﬂ  ex cables. A wire attached to the top of the leading edge  holds the sprog up in place.  [Figure 3-18]  

# Pitch Control System  

The pitch control system is a simple hinge on the keel at the  hang point that allows the pilot to push the control bar out and  

![](images/e769d7b77c98d3da5d8d6101e603d22eb25078222e58c245fa49d163e62b214f.jpg)

Figure 3-18.   Sprogs for strutted wing.  

pull the control bar in to control pitch. This wing attachment  is different for each manufacturer, but all designs have this  hang point wing attachment so the control bar is always  perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. This  raising and lowering of the nose is the pitch control system  for the WSC aircraft.  [Figures 2-7  and  3-19]  

![](images/f558f5f1b5d14718a696e4d41fd4413c1c9093fb64ff8f0ac60cf750a6ed48b0.jpg)  
Figure 3-19.  Hang point wing attachment.  

# Roll Control System  

Control bar movement from side to side controls the roll about  the longitudinal axis. The wing attachment hang point allows  the carriage to roll around the wing keel. Thus, it can also be  looked at from the carriage point of view, when the control  bar is moved side to side, the wing rotates around the wing  keel relative to the carriage.  [Figures 2-31  and  3-19]  

It would ﬁ  rst appear that moving the control bar to one side,  thus shifting weight to the opposite side, could alone bank  the aircraft. It is true that shifting weight to the right would  naturally bank the aircraft to the right and put it into a right  hand turn. However, the weight alone is not enough to provide  adequate roll control for practical ﬂ  ight.  

As weight is moved to one side, the keel is pulled closer to  that side’s leading edge. The actual keel movement is limited  to only 1 to 2 inches each side of center. However, this limited  keel movement is sufﬁ  cient to warp the wing, changing the  twist side to side (as discussed earlier in the aerodynamics  section) to roll the aircraft  [Figure 2-24]  by changing the  lift side to side. Simply, the shifting of weight from side to  side pulls the keel toward the leading edge on that side and  warps the wing to roll the aircraft.  

Besides the keel shifting relative to the leading edges and  crossbar, overall roll control is adjusted by the designers to  ﬁ  t the mission of the wing through sail material/stiffness,  leading edge stiffness/ﬂ  exibility, amount of twist, amount  of travel the keel is allowed, airfoil shape, and the planform  of the wing.  [Figures 3-20  and  3-21]

Figure 3-20.  Shifting weight to the right pulls the keel to the right  (or lets the crossbar shift to the left) and increases twist on the right  side for roll control.

# Trim Systems  

There are a number of trim systems to relieve the control  pressures for pilots to ﬂ  y at different “hands off” trim speeds.  Ground adjustable trim allows the pilot to adjust the trim  speed of the wing on the ground and remain at one speed  during ﬂ  ight, while ﬂ  ight adjustable trim systems can change  the trim speed in ﬂ  ight.  

# Ground Adjustable Trim Systems  

The most common ground adjustable trim system, and typical  of most aircraft, is moving the wing attachment hang point  forward for faster trim speeds and aft for slower trim speeds.  Each manufacturer has different hardware, but the basics of  sliding the carriage wing hang point forward and backward  on the keel is similar for all. As an example, moving the  hang point at the furthest aft position to the furthest forward  position could speed the wing up 20 knots. This in turn  moves the control bar position back to a new “hands off”  trim speed.  

Another less commonly used method of increasing trim  speed is to increase tension on the crossbar by pulling it back  further, slightly increasing the nose angle and reducing twist.  This increases the angle of attack (AOA) of the tips producing  more lift, and it lowers the nose to a higher trim speed. This  is a typical in-ﬂ  ight trim adjustment for high performance  hang gliders. The roll control is diminished with this faster  and stiffer wing.  

Ground adjustable trim systems are described in the Pilot's  Operating Handbook (POH) for each aircraft. Different loads  may require different pitch settings.  

# Inﬂ  ight Adjustable Trim Systems  

Being able to adjust the trim systems in ﬂ  ight has a number of  advantages as discussed later in the ﬂ  ight sections. A number  of inﬂ  ight adjustable systems are available with different  manufacturers. A common in-ﬂ  ight adjustable trim system  is raising and lowering the trailing edge. Raising the trailing  edge increases airfoil reﬂ  ex and slows the wing. Lowering  the trailing edge decreases airfoil reﬂ  ex and speeds up the  wing. Typically, a crank on a downtube controls a wire that  runs up the downtube to the top of the wing. As a result of  moving the crank, the trailing edge wires are raised and  lowered and the trim speed changed.  [Figure 3-22]  Hydraulic  

![](images/0b59ee432bfe8ee8bf06274841640977be5e356782ff61fb598d602c6e546a9b.jpg)  
Figure 3-22.  A crank on the downtube of the control bar that adjusts  the trailing edge reflex during flight.  

or electrical systems can move the hang point on the wing  for other inﬂ  ight trim systems.  [Figure 3-23]  

![](images/d669daff56d11be8e53b76498e52e1737de9bf7d84ad2bc02e25aff049c4d130.jpg)  
Figure 3-23.  Hydraulic inflight trim systems that move the hang  point in flight controlled by the pilot.  

Another pilot-actuated trim system in ﬂ  ight is an elastic  system in which the pilot increases tension on the elastic  system which raises the nose for climb and slower ﬂ  ight.  [Figure 3-24]  

![](images/d44a1de34201d9181c4cbe276f278caa150189312593302ae3e4da440a6f12ce.jpg)  
Figure 3-24.  More tension on elastic pulling down on the rear of  the wing keel reduces the trim speed and is controlled by the pilot  in flight.  

# Carriage  

The carriage is a completely separate structure from the  wing. Without the wing, the carriage can be driven around  if needed. Most of the weight and cost of the WSC aircraft  is in the carriage. There is a wide range of carriage designs  from the most simple and basic open trikes to the more  sophisticated and complex trikes that integrate cowlings and  offer a number of adjustments for the pilot and passenger,  resulting in comfort and less fatigue during ﬂ  ying. Generally,  

![](images/f15423ed12c3eaab6ed4b142347fa3852159cf8cb4ca71a624aa936d56e28c3d.jpg)

# Landing Gear  

the more complex the trike, the more it costs, weighs, and the  more power it requires for similar wings.  [Figure 3-25]  

The landing gear provides support to the WSC aircraft on  the ground and absorbs the shock to reduce the stresses on  the pilot and the aircraft during landings.  

# Structure  

Similar to the wing, the carriage is designed with a number  of structural triangles for optimum strength and minimum  weight. Each manufacturer and model have specific  details that vary, but  the carriage structure is  typically a mast, keel,  and front tube that  form the main triangle  components of the  carriage structure with  the wing attachment  at the top of the mast.  A seat frame attached  to the mast and keel  provides rigidity to the  main components while  providing structure for  the pilot and passenger.  [Figure 3-26]  

Landing struts attached  to the rear wheels  provide structure for the  main landing gear, and  a front fork provides the  landing gear structure  for the front wheel. An  engine mount attaches  to the mast, providing  structure for the  propulsion system to  attach to the carriage.  [Figure 3-26]  

![](images/1121e459c28b2e236ef2208f1dd921174ecc992a0874ed54985784b42e63c11a.jpg)  
Figure 3-26.   Basic components of the carriage structure.  

The landing gear is made up of the front wheel, which has  a lighter load and is used for steering, and the main or rear  landing gear, which takes most of the load for the aircraft.  [Figure 3-26]  The front steering fork for the nosewheel has  foot rests attached that the pilot uses for steering the WSC  aircraft on the ground. Besides ground steering, the foot  controls are similar to driving a car, left foot pedal is brakes  on the ground only, and right foot is throttle and power on the  ground and in ﬂ  ight.  [Figure 3-27]  The front fork typically  has camber so it naturally tracks in the direction of travel  similar to a motorcycle front fork.  

![](images/81e5c9072cb24c58539e6682c548628b7cb0001b4812306c8f837b9861250563.jpg)  
Figure 3-27.   Large foot rests used for steering the aircraft on the  ground (left hand ground brake shown).  

For training, a second steering control is installed with a  connecting rod so the instructor can sit in back and steer the  carriage on the ground using the nosewheel.  [Figure 3-28]   Steering dampers are sometimes used to stabilize the front  wheel from shimmying at higher speeds during takeoff and  landing.  [Figure 3-29]  The front wheel sometimes has shock  absorbers or the tire itself can act as the shock absorber. The

front wheel typically has a disk or a drum brake, mechanical  or hydraulic.  [Figures 3-30  and  3-31]  A front brake is lighter  and simpler than rear brakes, but some carriage brake systems  utilize the rear brakes.  

![](images/77ecdba551901640c9990413cb7057f87af6cd272cf0b508fa66752b59e6e072.jpg)  
Figure 3-30.   Mechanical drum brake system.  

A parking brake is extremely useful for securing the aircraft  on the ground without needing chocks for securing the  aircraft before takeoff and after landing. A number of parking  brake systems are utilized by different manufacturers.  [Figure 3-32]  

The main landing gear is the two rear wheels of the WSC  aircraft. Since the center of gravity (CG) is much closer to  the rear wheels, most of the weight for the aircraft is carried  on the rear wheels for taxi, takeoff, and landings.  

There are a number of different conﬁ  gurations for the main  gear. A conventional conﬁ  guration has two separate systems  for each rear wheel. Each side is two structural triangles, one  

![](images/2eea81b95e2dce7f4a9663847bd61d055ae0ab91080c4145e65692deb8f2f523.jpg)

horizontal and one vertical. The horizontal triangle consists  of a drag strut from the wheel forward to the keel or forward  structure to maintain the wheel’s fore and aft position, and  the main landing gear strut. Both the main and the drag  struts can pivot about the attachment to the keel as part of  the shock system.  

The vertical triangle consists of the main landing strut and the  shock strut attached to the wheel and up to the keel structure  [Figure 3-36]  or other structure such as the engine mount  shown in  Figure 3-33,  which houses the compressed nitrogen  and oil “oleo” shock absorber.  

There are a number of other main landing gear conﬁ  gurations  and shock absorbing systems such as wire bracing  with bungee cord shocks  [Figure 3-34],  fiberglass or  flexible (fiberglass or steel) main gears with no struts  [Figure 3-35],  and any variation of these. Carriages designed  for faster speeds may have streamlined landing gear systems.  [Figures 3-36  and  3-37]

Figure 3-37.   Solid flexible main landing gear that is streamlined.  

As discussed in the nosewheel section, the carriage can have  main landing gear brakes on both main landing gear wheels  that can be drum or disk and controlled by mechanical or  hydraulic actuation. Each manufacturer has different designs  and options.  

Tires can also assist as shock absorbers for landings. Large  tundra tires add signiﬁ  cant shock absorbing capability and  are used for operations on soft ﬁ  elds, rough ﬁ  elds, and sand.  [Figure 3-38]  Generally, the faster WSC aircraft used for  airport operations have narrower tires to eliminate drag.  

# Landing Gear for Water and Snow  

Besides landing gear for land, there are landing gear systems  for water (Weight-Shift Control Sea) and snow (ski-  

![](images/2a51b97c3a03b3071a50a16ea800ad627b1096e894997020a02832a335030517.jpg)

equipped). If ski-equipped, skis are added to the bottom of  the wheels or replace the wheels. If sea-equipped, a complete  system provides aircraft ﬂ  otation and steering using rudders  similar to a boat. The water rudders are foot controlled,  similar to WSCL steering on the ground. Two types of sea- equipped systems are the ﬂ  ying boat and pontoon.  

The ﬂ  ying boat is a solid or inﬂ  atable boat that the WSC  aircraft ﬁ  ts into, and its fuselage is secured to as well.  [Figure 3-39]  This is generally used for rougher seas in the  ocean and, with the extra drag of the boat itself, this typically  uses a larger wing and is therefore a slower ﬂ  ying WSC  aircraft. The boat design is known to be more stable in rough  seas and assists in keeping less water from splashing up so  pilot and passenger stay dryer.  

![](images/31e2d575547e7e90b6206bda4606dbb2b8f75d83dfe46e4d31715704e063d73f.jpg)  

# Figure 3-39.   Flying boat.  

The pontoon system is used for calmer water, has less drag  while ﬂ  ying, and therefore can accommodate faster, smaller  wings.  [Figure 3-40]  Both the ﬂ  ying boat and the pontoon  system need more horsepower than land operations for two  reasons: ﬁ  rst, to provide enough thrust to accelerate to takeoff  speed with the extra drag of the boat or pontoons on the water,  

![](images/926ac79d97f9c609545b5a83bbab6a180b1213a7a67503d5f2902086388f5166.jpg)  
Figure 3-40.   Pontoon system.  

and second, to provide enough extra thrust to overcome the  additional drag of the boat or pontoons in the air for ﬂ  ight.  

# Electrical Systems  

WSC aircraft are typically equipped with a 12-volt direct  current (DC) electrical system. A basic WSC aircraft  electrical system consists of a magneto/generator, voltage  regulator, battery, master/battery switch, and associated  electrical wiring. Electrical energy stored in a battery provides  a source of electrical power for starting the engine and other  electrical loads for the WSC aircraft.  

The electrical system is typically turned on or off with a  master switch. Turning the master switch to the on position  provides electrical energy from the battery to all the electrical  equipment circuits with the exception of the ignition system.  Equipment that commonly uses the electrical system energy  includes:  

•  Position lights •  Anticollision lights •  Instrument lights •  Radio equipment •  Navigation equipment •  Electronic instrumentation •  Electric fuel pump •  Starting motor •  Electric heating systems (gloves, socks, pants, vests,  jackets, etc.)  

Spare fuses of the proper amperage should be carried in the  WSC aircraft to replace defective or blown fuses. Circuit  breakers have the same function as a fuse but can be manually  reset, rather than replaced, if an overload condition occurs in  the electrical system. Placards at the fuse or circuit breaker  panel identify the circuit by name and show the amperage  limit.  

An ammeter may be used to monitor the performance of  the electrical system. The ammeter shows if the magneto/ generator is producing an adequate supply of electrical power.  It also indicates whether or not the battery is receiving an  electrical charge. A voltage meter also provides electrical  information about battery voltage, an additional status of  the electrical system.  

# Ballistic Parachute  

An additional safety system available is a ballistic parachute  system. In the case of a structural failure because of a mid-air  collision or an engine out over hostile terrain such as a forest,  the ballistic parachute provides an added safety system. The  parachute is sized so that when used, the complete aircraft  comes down under canopy. Details of ballistic parachute  system use are covered in more detail in Chapter 13,  Abnormal and Emergency Operations.  

When the system is activated, a rocket shoots out, pulling the  parachute system to full line stretch, and forcing the parachute  out and away from the carriage and wing.  

The preferred point of attachment for the parachute is on top  of the wing at the hang point. This allows the WSC aircraft  to descend level and land on the wheels, helping to absorb  the shock. This requires routing from the chute to the top of  the wing with “O” rings to be able to remove this routing to  easily take the wing off the carriage. Alternate attach points  where there is no routing to the top of the wing are the mast  and engine attachment points; however, this has the WSC  aircraft descending nose down when activated.  

The ballistic parachute canister can be mounted in a number  of locations on the WSC, typically on the carriage pointed  sideways to avoid entanglement with the propeller. The  actuation handle is mounted in the ﬂ  ight deck for pilot use  when needed.  [Figures 3-41  and  3-42]  

Fuses or circuit breakers are used in the electrical system to  protect the circuits and equipment from electrical overload.

Figure 3-42.   Canister mounted under engine.  

# Flight Deck  

The ﬂ  ight deck is where the pilot and passenger sit. It is  typically a tandem seating with the pilot in front and the  passenger in back. When the WSC aircraft is used for  instruction, the instructor typically sits in back and must have  access to the ﬂ  ight controls.  

The pilot in the front has ground and ﬂ  ight controls. The  right foot controls a foot throttle and the left foot controls  the brake. This is similar to throttle and brake controls on an  automobile. The feet also control ground steering by moving  the front fork with the foot pedals. A foot throttle and foot  brake can be added to optional ground steering control for  use by an instructor sitting in back.  

A hand cruise throttle is typically used when the pilot can  set it and it stays set. This cruise throttle is usually in a  position where the instructor in the back seat can also operate  it.  [Figures 3-43]  

![](images/3c1dbab043cb5feead125362c88d37d5d12e340faeeefa122865680b4e775a5a.jpg)  
Figure 3-43.   Cruise throttle control and ignition switches.  

for a passenger or instructor to use if seated in the back seat.  [Figure 3-7]  

Ignition switches are sometimes included in the cruise  control throttle housing or as a separate set of switches. If  a WSC is used for instruction, the ignition switches should  be within reach of the instructor sitting in the back seat.  [Figures 3-43]  

The ballistic parachute handle must be accessible for use  when needed but not put in a position where it could be  accidentally deployed. Some WSC aircraft have two handles,  one for the front and one for the back. Additional controls  for starting, such as the choke or enricher, must be accessible  to the pilot.  

# Dashboards and Instrument Panels  

The instrument panel is in front of the pilot and provides  engine, ﬂ  ight, navigation, and communications information.  The pilot is responsible for maintaining collision avoidance  with a proper and continuous visual scan around the aircraft,  as well as monitoring the information available from the  instrument panel. The pilot must process the outside cues  along with the instrumentation throughout the ﬂ  ight for a  sound decision-making process.  

The ignition switches, which may be located on the  instrument panel or within the instructors reach for WSC  used for instruction, has two positions: ON, which allows  power to make contact with the spark plugs, or OFF, which is  a closed switch to GROUND and removes the power source  from the spark plugs. Typically, WSC engines have two  spark plugs per cylinder, two switches, and two completely  separate ignition systems. Some single-place WSCs with  smaller engines have only one spark plug per cylinder, one  ignition switch, and a single ignition system.  

The wing ﬂ  ight control bar is in a position at chest height for  the pilot in the front seat. Additional extensions are added  For example, for a two-stroke liquid-cooled engine, the  manufacturer may require instrumentation to monitor engine  exhaust gas temperatures (EGT), water temperatures, and  revolutions per minute (rpm). Additionally, for a four- stroke engine, the manufacturer may additionally require oil  temperature and pressure gauges. For a simple two-stroke air- cooled engine, the manufacturer’s requirement may be EGT,  cylinder head temperature (CHT) and rpm instrumentation.  Generally, most electrical or engine controls are located on  the dashboard unless required to be reached by the instructor  for ﬂ  ight instruction.  

Dashboards are as varied as the manufacturers and the  purpose of the aircraft, from simple to complex. Classical  analog gauges are common, but digital instruments are  becoming more popular with light-sport aircraft (LSA).  

Overall, no instrumentation is required for E-LSA, but for  S-LSA an airspeed indicator is usually required, and engine  manufacturers require certain instruments be installed on the  aircraft to monitor the performance of the particular engine.  

# Flight Instruments  

The speciﬁ  c theory of operation and details of instruments is  covered in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,  and is a prerequisite to this section on ﬂ  ight instruments. The  altimeter is the most important ﬂ  ight instrument and should  be on every WSC aircraft. It is used to maintain the proper  altitude at airports, during cruise, and provides other aircraft  position information for the safety of all.  

The vertical speed indicator (VSI) is one tool to assist the pilot  with the performance of the aircraft. The airspeed indicator  (ASI) is used to optimize performance of the aircraft, compare  predicted to actual performance, and to operate within the  limitations of the aircraft.  

# Navigation Instruments  

A global positioning system (GPS) is typically used as a  navigation and ﬂ  ight aid for most WSC aircraft. A magnetic  compass is commonly used as a primary navigation system  or as a backup when a GPS system is used.  

# Engine Instruments  

There is a variety of engine instruments that are used. The  most basic is the engine rpm, which determines the power  of the engine. Speciﬁ  c engine instruments are discussed in  the powerplant section.  

# Instrument Panel Arrangements  

Instrument panels vary greatly from the basic to the complex.  Figure 3-44  depicts a standard instrument panel supplied  by the manufacturer with a portable GPS added in the  middle. Electrical components are neatly arranged along the  top. Large analog airspeed (left) and altitude (right) ﬂ  ight  instruments are installed in the middle with the portable  GPS installed between the two. The bottom stack consists  of the basic engine instruments for a simple two-stroke air- cooled engine: RPM for power (top), CHT (middle) and  EGT (bottom).  

![](images/1ba75f2b9877cf1d4fcf8b457855f6aed0e686fd9582db01f2148f3a36647de0.jpg)  
Figure 3-44.   Basic analog flight and engine instruments.  

A more advanced analog panel with a user radio and GPS  added is shown in  Figure 3-45.  Airspeed, vertical speed  indicator, and altitude large ﬂ  ight instruments are along

the top. A navigational gyro is in the middle of the panel.  The bottom row consists of four-stroke engine instruments,  electrical and remote fuel gauge. The user installed radio and  GPS complete a well equipped instrument panel. A hybrid  panel of analog, digital, and portable instruments is shown  in  Figure 3-46.

Figure 3-47.   Digital instrument panel.  

The integrated digital panel does provide more options  in a smaller space. One panel can now have aircraft  performance screens, engine systems screens, navigation  screens, communications screens, attitude indicator, and any  combination of these.  [Figure 3-47]  

# Communications  

There are three types of communications systems used in  WSC aircraft:  

1.  Communications between the pilot and passenger  while inside the aircraft.  2.  Aircraft radio communications with other aircraft and  control towers.  3.  Radar position indicator communications from the  WSC aircraft to control towers (transponder).  

Easy and clear communications between the pilot and  passenger, or between the instructor and student inside  the ﬂ  ight deck is important for the safety and enjoyment  of both. Modern communications systems have advanced  noise canceling systems in headphones and microphones to  reduce engine noise and blast of air. Each system is unique,  and the quality of the sound and noise canceling capability  of the system varies. Some use voice-activated systems in  which headphones activate only when someone is speaking  into the microphone; others have a steady state in which  there is no additional control of the voice activation. Since  there is a large difference in systems available, it is best to  test systems to determine what is best for the WSC aircraft  being ﬂ  own.  [Figure 3-48]  

An aircraft radio is required for ﬂ  ying in any tower controlled  airspace. Using a radio is not required at airports without a  control tower but it is recommended for the safety of self,  passengers, pilots in the air, and people/property on the  ground. To broadcast to a tower or other aircraft, press a  Push To Talk (PTT) button. A complete ﬂ  ight deck radio and  accessory system schematic is shown in  Figure 3-49 .  

![](images/674d7a1b8828b448800a2651526e149daa7db0a9079b4d1c35640902f644c2ef.jpg)  
Figure 3-48.   Basic pilot-to-passenger communication system.  

A radar signal receiver/transmitter system is required at busy  commercial airports (Classes C and B) and at altitudes above  10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) (unless the aircraft was  certiﬁ  ed without an electrical system to power the unit). This  is known as a Mode C transponder that sends a signal giving  the control tower an exact location and altitude of aircraft.  [Figure 3-47]  

# Powerplant System  

The powerplant system is composed of the fuel system,  engine, gearbox, and propeller. Here we will point out the  basic components of these systems with their function and  details covered in Chapter 4, Powerplant System.  

![](images/49fc174c41c5ba6664f27dfd956c4ce93750f4e88fddc747ba64dcf52a60e662.jpg)  
Figure 3-49.   Flight deck and aircraft radio communications system example.  

# Fuel System Components  

The WSC aircraft is equipped with fuel tanks usually ranging  in capacity from 5 to 20 gallons. As with any aircraft,  knowing how much fuel the tank holds is crucial to ﬂ  ight  operations. The LSA deﬁ  nition has no limitations on the size  of the fuel tank, unlike its ultralight vehicle predecessor.  

Generally, the fuel tank is located close to the CG, so fuel  burn does not affect the balance of the carriage. Some fuel  tanks are clear for visual inspection of the amount of fuel  on board  [Figure 3-50],  while others have tanks that are not  visible and require fuel level probes for instrument panel  indication of fuel.  [Figure 3-51]  

![](images/c079fe8c6a1c9874d89ed8723779317063e306c17a5bae0360dab406b3c56232.jpg)

Figure 3-51.   Fuel fill to fuel tank under passengers seat.  

Fuel lines exit the fuel tank, and may incorporate a primer  bulb, fuel ﬁ  lters, fuel pump, and/or a primer system, all of  which must be integrated into the carriage. A fuel venting  system is also required, which can be a hole in the fuel ﬁ  ller  or lines running to vent at an appropriate location.  

A fuel shut-off valve may be installed and can be located  anywhere in the fuel line. Some designs have a fuel tank sump  drain valve to remove water and solid contaminants.  

# Engine and Gearbox  

The typical WSC aircraft engine can be two or four stroke,  liquid or air cooled, and normally ranges from 50 to 100  horsepower. Some engines have electric starters and some  have pull starters. Most WSC aircraft engines have reduction  drives that, when attached, reduce the propeller rpm from  $\%$  to  $\%$   the engine rpm.  [Figure 3-52]  

![](images/646716e5a8abbb657f37edc17eb532fe1e03899198ec7564cd0d88851b30ae60.jpg)  
Figure 3-52.   Engine gearbox.  

A signiﬁ  cant amount of the total aircraft empty weight  is determined by the powerplant (engine, gearbox, and  propeller) and mounting conﬁ  guration. When trailering  the WSC aircraft over bumpy terrain or over long trips,  the bouncing of the carriage in the trailer can put extreme  stress on this mounting system. In addition, repeated hard  landings of the carriage can also stress the welds of the engine  mount. Consistent detailed inspections of the engine mount  should be an important part of every preﬂ  ight and postﬂ  ight  inspection.  

The powerplant systems are as varied as the WSC aircraft  they power. Modern technology has allowed these systems  to become lighter, quieter, more efficient, and, most  importantly, dependable.  

# The Propeller  

Propellers are “power converters” that change the engine  horsepower into thrust. Thrust is the force that propels the  aircraft through the air by pushing the WSC aircraft forward.  Aerodynamically speaking, a propeller is a rotating airfoil  and the same principles that apply to the wing applies to the  propeller, except the propeller provides a horizontal force  of thrust.  

![](images/a1c1045ff6f6797e53759aae8b4a6bbe4ecd6acff0aeb9479ebcac1cb09ae799.jpg)  
Figure 3-53.   Four-blade propeller.  

Propellers typically consist of two, three, or four blades.  [Figures 3-53  and  3-54]  Propellers can be ground adjustable  or ﬁ  xed pitch. Variable pitch ﬂ  ight propellers are not allowed  on LSA. The pitch should be properly set for your WSC  aircraft to provide the recommended rpm of the engine at  full power. The POH should be consulted if there is any  question about the propeller rpm and adjusting or replacing  the propeller. Propellers are speciﬁ  cally matched to the  engine power, gear reduction and speed range of the aircraft.  Therefore, not just any propeller may be put on any engine.  The POH requires speciﬁ  c propellers that are matched for  each aircraft.  

As with an airplane propeller, the WSC aircraft propeller  turns at such high speeds that it becomes invisible when in  motion. The dangers of a turning propeller require every  pilot to maintain the highest level of safety and respect for  the consequences of body parts, pets, and debris coming  

![](images/1c0624aa6bb9c93c88f6d927d392b0fb9fa7bcde03e04b4042bfe2a8e4c3fc80.jpg)  
Figure 3-54.   Three-blade propeller.  

in contact with a rotating propeller. Debris on the takeoff/ landing ﬁ  eld is a danger to the propeller, as well as to the  people who may be in the prop-wash area behind or on the  side of the propeller. Stones, small pieces of metal, and  sticks can become dangerous projectiles if kicked into the  propeller during start-up, taxi, takeoff, and landing. Just as  with any airframe or wing component of a WSC aircraft, if the  propeller becomes damaged, nicked, or dinged, the aircraft’s  performance can be greatly affected. Some pilots elect to use  tape or rock deﬂ  ector guards to protect the leading edge from  rock/debris damage. Regardless, taking proper care of the  propeller is as critical as proper engine and wing care.  

# Chapter Summary  

Components and systems consist of two primary  subassemblies: wing and carriage. The main wing component  is the frame, which is composed of the leading edges, keel,  crossbar, and control frame. The typical wing frame has lower  wires and upper wires with a king post. The strutted version  has wing struts and no upper rigging. The frame is designed  so the outboard leading edges ﬂ  ex, and it also has a control  system that allows the keel to move side to side relative to the  leading edges for roll control. The sail is designed speciﬁ  cally  for the frame with battens and leading edge stiffner provide  the rigid airfoil shape of the sail.  

The carriage is separate from the wing. Different wings can be  put on the same carriage at separate times for different types  of ﬂ  ying (example: large wing is used for ﬂ  ying low and slow  where a small wing can be used for ﬂ  ying fast and long cross- country missions). As discussed in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics,  each wing must be approved by the manufacturer to go on  a speciﬁ  c carriage.  

Main carriage components are the mast, carriage keel, front  tube, and engine mount. This structure houses the ﬂ  ight deck,  powerplant, and landing gear. The carriage structure also  houses system components such as the electrical system,  ballistic parachute, and fuel tank. The ﬂ  ight deck is the heart  of the carriage providing pilot systems for communications,  navigation, engine/flight/navigation instruments, and  electrical controls.  

# Chapter 4 Powerplants  

This chapter covers the engines found on most weight-shift  control (WSC) aircraft and includes the exhaust, ignition,  lubrication, cooling, propeller, gearbox, induction, charging,  and fuel systems. Reciprocating engine operating theory is  covered for both two-stroke and four-stroke engines. The  WSC engine and propeller, often referred to as a powerplant,  work in combination to produce thrust. The powerplant  propels the aircraft and charges the electrical system that  supports WSC operation.  

The powerplant system is composed of the engine, gearbox,  and propeller. It is a key component of a WSC aircraft and  should be maintained according to both the engine and  airframe manufacturer recommendations.  

Preﬂ  ight information, along with maintenance schedules  and procedures, can be found in the pilot’s operating  handbook (POH) for Special Light-Sport Aircraft (S-LSA),  and/or maintenance references from the manufacturers.  Engine inspections and maintenance must be performed and  documented in a logbook. A pilot should review this logbook  before ﬂ  ying an unfamiliar aircraft.  

# Reciprocating Engines  

WSC aircraft are designed with reciprocating engines.  [Figures 4-1  through  4-3]  Two common means of classifying  reciprocating engines are the:  

1.  Number of piston strokes needed to complete a  cycle—two or four.  2.  Method of cooling—liquid or air.  

Refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge  for a comprehensive review of how reciprocating four-stroke  engines operate.  

# Two-Stroke Engines  

Two-stroke engines are commonly used in WSC aircraft. Two- stroke aviation engines evolved from two-stroke snowmobile  and watercraft engines, the difference being that an aircraft  engine is optimized for reliability with dual ignition often  installed for each cylinder. Two-stroke engines are popular  because they have fewer components than four-stroke engines  which makes them less expensive to manufacture and lighter,  thus increasing the power-to-weight ratio.  

Two-stroke engines require that oil be mixed into the fuel  to lubricate the engine, instead of being held in a sump and  requiring a separate pressurized recirculating system like that  of a four-stroke engine. Details on two-stroke oil mixing are  covered in the lubrication section. One stroke as the piston  moves up is intake and compression, while the second stroke  as the piston moves down is power and exhaust. The two-

Figure 4-3.   Four-stroke water- and oil-cooled engine.  

stroke engine performs the same functions as a four-stroke  engine in half the number of strokes.  

A wide range of valve systems are found on two-stroke  engines for the purpose of opening and closing ports in  the cylinder to let fuel in and exhaust out at the proper  time. This is similar to the intake and exhaust valves on a  four-stroke engine. One-way pressure valves, called spring,  reed, or poppet valves, open when the pressure drops within  the crankcase, pulling the fuel from the carburetor into the  crankcase.  [Figure 4-4]  

Mechanical rotary valves are driven off the engine, rotate  to provide an opening at the precise time, and can be on the  intake and exhaust ports.  [Figure 4-5]  

![](images/216cef74a3f897b1aa2527de16a7b6bff0c9af076c06aefbb334f438b44f78d0.jpg)

Figure 4-5.  Intake rotary valve for a two-stroke engine.  

Piston porting does not use any valves. The fuel inlet port is  opened and closed by the piston position as it moves up and  down in the cylinder. This is called a “piston ported inlet” and  is used in the two-stroke process description that follows.  

# Two-Stroke Process  

The two-stroke process begins with the fuel entering the  engine and concludes as it exits as exhaust.  

# Crankcase Vacuum Intake Stroke—Piston Moving  Up  

The upward stroke of the piston  [Figure   $_{4-6A J}$    creates a  vacuum in the crankcase and pulls the fuel/air/oil mixture  into the crankcase through the intake valve system from the  carburetor.  [Figure 4-6B]  This can be a pressure-actuated  reed valve, a rotary valve, or a ported inlet system where  the lower piston skirt provides an opening for the fuel/air/oil  mixture to ﬂ  ow in when the piston is reaching its highest  point of top dead center (TDC). At this point, the greatest  portion of the fuel/oil/air mixture has ﬁ  lled the crankcase.  [Figure 4-6B]  

# Crankcase Compression Stroke—Piston Moving  Down  

During the downward stroke, the pressure valve is forcibly  closed by the increased crankcase pressure, the mechanical  rotary valve closes, or the piston closes off the fuel/air oil  mixture intake port as shown. The fuel/oil/air mixture is then  compressed in the crankcase during the downward stroke of  the piston.  [Figures 4-6B  to  4-6D]

Figure 4-6.  Piston ported inlet cycles for a two-stroke engine.  

# Crankcase Transfer/Exhaust—Piston at Lowest  

When the piston is near the bottom of its stroke, the transfer  port opening from the crankcase to the combustion chamber  is exposed, and the high pressure fuel/air mixture in the  crankcase transfers around the piston into the main cylinder.  This fresh fuel/oil/air mixture pushes out the exhaust (called  scavenging) as the piston is at its lowest point and the exhaust  port is open. Some of the fresh fuel/oil/air mixture can escape  through the exhaust port, resulting in the higher fuel use of  the two-stroke engine.  [Figure 4-6D]  

# Cylinder Start of Compression Stroke—Piston  Initially Moving Up  

As the piston starts to move up, covering the transfer port,  the tuned exhaust bounces a pressure wave at the precise time  across the exhaust port to minimize the fuel/air/oil mixture  escaping through the exhaust port.  [Figure 4-6E]  

# Cylinder Compression Stroke—Piston Moving Up  

The piston then rises and compresses the fuel mixture in  the combustion chamber.  [Figure 4-6E  to  4-6F]  During this  piston compression process, the crankcase vacuum intake  process is happening simultaneously, as described earlier.  This is why four processes can happen in two strokes.  [Figures 4-6B  and  4-6C]  

# Cylinder Power Stroke—Initial Piston Moving  Down  

At the top of the stroke, the spark plug ignites the fuel/oil/air  mixture and drives the piston down as the power stroke of  the engine.  [Figures 4-6F  and  4-6G]  

# Cylinder Power Stroke—Final Piston Moving Down  

As the piston passes the exhaust port, the exhaust exits the  combustion chamber. As the piston continues down, the  transfer port opens and the swirling motion of the fuel/ oil/air mixture pushes the exhaust out of the exhaust port.  [Figures 4-6H]  

# Piston Reverses Direction From Down Stroke to Up  Stroke  

As the piston reverses direction from the down stroke to the up  stroke, the process is complete.  [Figures 4-6H  and  4-6A]  

# Four-Stroke Engines  

Four-stroke engines are very common in most aircraft  categories and are becoming more common in WSC  aircraft.  [Figure 4-7]  Four-stroke engines have a number  of advantages, including reliability, fuel economy, longer  engine life, and higher horsepower ranges.  

![](images/149f3e5214d47a20c1e44f0526255f42d7da18d5535558d9d58b6ff1cc6cbd90.jpg)  
Figure 4-7.  The cycles in a four-stroke engine.  

These advantages are countered by a higher acquisition cost,  lower power-to-weight ratios, and a higher overall weight.  The increased weight and cost are the result of additional  components (e.g., camshaft, valves, complex head to house  the valve train) incorporated in a four-stoke engine.  

# Exhaust Systems  

Engine exhaust systems vent the burned combustion gases  overboard, reduce engine noise, and (in the case of two- stroke engines) help keep the fresh fuel/oil/air mixture in the  cylinders. An exhaust system has exhaust piping attached  to the cylinders, as well as a mufﬂ  er. The exhaust gases  are pushed out of the cylinder and through the exhaust pipe  system to the atmosphere.  

Some exhaust systems have an exhaust gas temperature  probe. This probe transmits an electric signal to an instrument  in front of the pilot. This instrument reads the signal and  provides the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of the gases at  the exhaust manifold. This temperature varies with power and  with the mixture (ratio of fuel to air entering the cylinders),  and is used to make sure the fuel/air mixture is within  speciﬁ  cations. When there is a problem with carburetion,  the EGT gauge will normally be the ﬁ  rst notiﬁ  cation for a  pilot.  [Figure 4-8]  

![](images/a38658767ce52218212574748dd539bf96b2947c558fc54c618f9ee48a0848c3.jpg)  
Figure 4-8.   Two-stroke tuned exhaust system with EGT probes  installed where the exhaust enters the exhaust system.  

# Two-Stroke Tuned Exhaust Systems  

In two-stroke engines, the exhaust system increases the fuel  economy and power of the engine. The two-stroke exhaust  system is an integral part of any two-stroke engine design,  often controlling peak power output, the torque curve, and  even the revolutions per minute (RPM) limit of the engine.  

The exhaust system must be tuned to produce a back pressure  wave at the exhaust port to act as an exhaust valve as shown  in  Figure 4-6E.  When hot spent gases are vented out of the  exhaust port, they are moving fast enough to set up a high  pressure wave. The momentum of that wave down the exhaust  pipe diffuser lowers the pressure behind it. That low pressure  is used to help suck out all of the residual, hot, burnt gas  from the power stroke and at the same time help pull a fresh  fuel/air charge into the cylinder. This is called scavenging  and is an important function of a tuned two-stroke exhaust  system.  [Figure 4-6H]  

The design of the exhaust converging section causes a  returning pressure wave to push the fresh fuel/air charge  back into the exhaust port before the cylinder closes off that  port. Called pulse charging, it is another important function  of the exhaust system.  [Figure 4-6E]  

Tuned exhaust systems are typically tuned to a particular  rpm range. The more a certain rpm range is emphasized, the  less effective the engine will operate at other rpm. Vehicles  like motorcycles take advantage of this with the use of  transmissions. Motorcycle exhaust pipe builders can optimize  a certain rpm range and then the driver shifts gears to stay in  that range. Aircraft, with no transmission, do not have this  ability. On an aircraft, an exhaust pipe has to be designed to  operate over a broad range of rpm from idle to full speed, a  reason that simply putting a snowmobile engine on a WSC  does not work well.  

Overall, the two-stroke exhaust system for a WSC aircraft is a  speciﬁ  c design and must be matched to the engine to operate  properly and obtain the rated power. It also reduces noise  and directs the exhaust to an appropriate location. Exhaust  silencers can be added to reduce noise, but additional weight,  cost, and slight power reduction are the byproducts.  

# Four-Stroke Engine Exhaust Systems  

Four-stroke engines are not as sensitive as two-stroke engines  because they have exhaust valves and, therefore, do not  need the precision pulse tuned exhaust system. However,  directing the exhaust out appropriately and reducing  the noise are important considerations. Again, using the  manufacturer’s recommended conﬁ  gurations is required  for S-LSA and recommended for Experimental Light-Sport  Aircraft (E-LSA).  

# Engine Warming  

# Two-Stroke Engine Warming  

Two-stroke engines must be warmed because different metals  expand at different rates as they are heated. When heating  steel and aluminum, the aluminum parts expand faster than  the steel parts. This becomes a problem in two different  areas of many two-stroke engines. The ﬁ  rst place is in the  cylinders of the engine.  

The cylinders have steel walls that expand slowly, compared  to aluminum pistons that expand quickly. If an engine is  revved too quickly during takeoff before warming up, a lot of  heat is generated on top of the piston. This quickly expands  the piston, which can then seize in the cylinder. A piston  seizure will stop the engine abruptly.  

The second area of concern is lower in the engine around  the crankshaft. This is an area where parts may get too loose  with heat, rather than seizing up. Additionally, the crankcase  has steel bearings set into the aluminum which need to  expand together or the bearings could slip. Many two-stroke  engines have steel bearings that normally hug the walls of  the aluminum engine case. The crank spins within the donuts  of those steel bearings.  

If the engine heats too quickly, the aluminum case out- expands those steel bearings and the crank causes the bearings  to start spinning along with it. If those steel bearings start  spinning, it can ruin the soft aluminum walls of the case,  which is very expensive. If heat is slowly added to an engine,  all parts will expand more evenly. This is done through a  proper warm-up procedure. Many two-stroke engines are  best warmed up by running the engine at a set rpm for a set  amount of time. Follow the instructions in the POH; however,  a good rule of thumb is to start the engine initially at idle  rpm, get it operating smoothly at   ${2,}500~\mathrm{rpm}$   for 2 minutes  for initial warm up, and then warm the engine at   $3{,}000\,\mathrm{rpm}$    for 5 minutes. The cylinder head temperature or coolant  temperature must be up to the manufacturer’s recommended  temperatures before takeoff. This may require running the  engine at higher rpm to reach required temperatures on some  engines.  

Once the engine is warmed up and the aircraft is ﬂ  ying, it is  still possible to cool down the engine too much. This happens  when the engine is idled back for an extended period of time.  Even though the engine is running, it is not generating as  much heat as the cooling system is efﬁ  ciently dumping engine  heat into the atmosphere. An immediate power application  with a cooled engine can seize the engine just as if the engine  had not been warmed in the ﬁ  rst place.  

In water-cooled engines, on a long descent at idle, the  coolant cools until the thermostat closes and the engine is not  circulating the radiator ﬂ  uid through the engine. The engine  temperature remains at this thermostat closed temperature  while the radiator coolant continues to cool further. If full  throttle is applied, the thermostat can open, allowing a blast  of coolant into the warm engine. The piston is expanding due  to the added heat, and the cylinder is cooling with the cold  radiator water, resulting in piston seizure. To prevent this,  slowly add power well before getting close to the ground  where power is needed. This gives the system a chance to open  the thermostat gradually and warm up the radiator water.  

Just as it takes time for the engine crankcase and bearings  to warm up, it also takes those steel parts a long time to cool  down. If a pilot lands, refuels, and wants to take off again  quickly, there is no need to warm up again for 5 minutes.  The lower end of the engine stays warmed up after being  shut down for short periods.  

Any engine restart is an example in which it would be  appropriate to warm the engine up until the gauges reach  operating temperatures. The lower end of the engine is warm  and now a pilot needs to be concerned only with preventing  the pistons from seizing.  

# Four-Stroke Engine Warming  

A four-stroke engine must also be warmed up. The four- stroke engine has a pressurized oil system that provides  more uniform engine temperatures to all of its components.  Takeoff power can be applied as soon as the water, cylinder  head temperature (CHT), oil temperatures, and oil pressure  are within the manufacturer’s recommended tolerances for  takeoff power applications.  

# Gearboxes  

Gearboxes are used on most WSC reciprocating engines to  take the rotational output of an internal combustion engine  which is turning at a high rpm and convert it to a slower (and  more useful) rpm to turn the propeller. Gearboxes come in  different gear ratios depending on the output speed of the  engine and the needed propeller turning speeds.  

Some examples are a two-stroke rpm reduction from 6,500  engine rpm with a 3.47 to 1 reduction, resulting in 1,873  propeller rpm. A four-stroke rpm reduction could be from  5,500 engine rpm with a 2.43 to 1 reduction, resulting in  2,263 propeller rpm. A gearbox is a simple device that bolts  directly to the engine and, in turn, has the propeller bolted  directly to it.  

A two-cycle engine gearbox is kept lubricated with its own  built-in reservoir of heavy gearbox oil. The reservoir is  actually part of the gearbox case itself. The gearbox oil has  to be changed periodically since the meshing of the gears  will cause them to wear and will deposit steel ﬁ  lings into  the oil. If the oil is not changed, the abrasive ﬁ  lings cause  even more wear.  

Some gearboxes have a built-in electric starter motor. When  activated, the motor turns the gearing which cranks the  engine.  

Four-stroke propeller reduction gearboxes use oil from the  engine oil system for lubrication.  

Some gearboxes come with a built-in centrifugal clutch  and others have allowances for installation. A centrifugal  clutch is very useful in a two-stroke engine because it allows  the engine to idle at a lower speed without the load of the  propeller. Otherwise, two-stroke engines can generate a great  deal of vibration at low rpm when loaded. As the engine  speeds up, the centrifugal clutch engages and smoothly starts  the propeller spinning. When the engine is brought back  to idle, the clutch disengages and allows the engine to idle  smoothly again; the propeller stops when on the ground and  windmills when ﬂ  ying.  

# Propeller  

The propeller provides the necessary thrust to push the WSC  aircraft through the air. The engine power is used to rotate the  propeller, which generates thrust very similar to the manner  in which a wing produces lift. The amount of thrust produced  depends on the airfoil shape, the propeller blade angle of  attack (AOA), and the engine rpm.  [Figure 4-9]  Light-sport  aircraft (LSA) are equipped with either a ﬁ  xed-pitch or a  ground adjustable-pitch propeller.  

![](images/b18ddac09b668b3bb8604ee4c44c64c2699ef506a83e5c4f4d73df15e34a3c4c.jpg)  
Figure 4-9.   Engine rpm is indicated on the analog gauge (top) and  the digital gauge (bottom).  

# Fixed-Pitch Propeller  

The pitch of the fixed-pitch propeller is set by the  manufacturer and cannot be changed. Refer to the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for basic propeller  principles.  

# Ground Adjustable-Pitch Propeller  

Adjustable-pitch propellers for WSC aircraft can be adjusted  only on the ground with hand tools. If an engine is over- revving, more pitch can be added to the propeller. If the  engine is not developing the full recommended rpm during  ﬂ  ight, then some pitch can be taken out of the blades. This  should be done according to the WSC aircraft’s POH and by  a qualiﬁ  ed technician.  

# Induction Systems  

The induction system brings air in from the atmosphere,  mixes it with fuel, and delivers the fuel/air mixture (fuel/oil/ air mixture for two stroke engines) to the engine intake and  to the cylinders where combustion occurs. Outside air enters  the induction system through an air ﬁ  lter on the engine. The  air ﬁ  lter inhibits the entry of dust and other foreign objects.  Two types of induction systems are used in WSC engines:  

1.  The carburetor system is most common. It mixes the  fuel and air in the carburetor before this mixture enters  the engine intake. 2.  The fuel injection system injects the fuel into the air  just before entry into each cylinder.  

# Carburetor Systems  

WSC aircraft use ﬂ  oat-type carburetors. The “ﬂ  oat-type  carburetor” acquires its name from a ﬂ  oat that rests on fuel  within the carburetor ﬂ  oat chamber, commonly known as  the fuel bowls. The ﬂ  oat maintains the fuel level in the  fuel bowls. As fuel is used by the engine, the fuel and ﬂ  oat  levels drop, opening the valve letting more fuel into the  fuel bowls until the proper level of fuel in the fuel bowls  is achieved and the valve is closed. Reference the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for basic information  on ﬂ  oat carburetor operation. Modern two- and four-stroke  carburetors operate with three separate jetting systems  depending on engine power.  [Figure 4-10]  

When the throttle is closed for engine idling, the throttle  valve is closed and the fuel/air mixture is supplied through  the idle (pilot) jet and idle (pilot) air passage. The fuel/air  mixture is supplied to the cylinders through the bypass hole.  [Figure 4-11]  

As the throttle is advanced and the throttle valve is raised,  the fuel is sucked up through the main jet but is controlled  by the opening and taper of the jet needle and needle jet.  This is effective throughout most of the midrange operation.  About half throttle, the main jet size starts to inﬂ  uence the  amount of fuel mixed with the air and this effect continues  until it is the main inﬂ  uence at the highest throttle settings.  [Figures 4-10  and  4-12]  

![](images/7103a6d3dd02b429511b7f53c36ec59304de3f7e36f908640889017e45aa61da.jpg)

# Two-Stroke Carburetor Jetting for Proper Mixture  

Carburetors are normally set at sea level pressure with  the jets and settings determined by the manufacturer.  [Figure 4-13]  However, as altitude increases, the density  of air entering the carburetor decreases, while the density of  the fuel remains the same. This creates a progressively richer  mixture, same fuel but less air, which can result in engine  roughness and an appreciable loss of power. The roughness  is usually due to spark plug fouling from excessive carbon  buildup on the plugs. Carbon buildup occurs because the  excessively rich mixture lowers the temperature inside the  cylinder, inhibiting complete combustion of the fuel.  

![](images/058aa846eeb327e12f2e7523494effa1c99e421f6e9869775a29b0907c12a24d.jpg)  
Figure 4-13.   Typical two-stroke carburetor.  

This condition may occur at high elevation airports and  during climbs or cruise ﬂ  ight at high altitudes. To maintain  the correct fuel/oil/air mixture, the main jets are usually  changed for smaller jets based on the density altitude of  the base airport. Operating from low altitude airports and  climbing to altitude where the mixture becomes rich for short  periods is acceptable.  

Operating an aircraft at a lower altitude airport with the jets  set for higher altitudes will create too lean of a mixture, heat  up the engine, and cause the engine to seize. The pilot must  be aware of the jetting for the machine to adjust the mixture.  Consult your POH for speciﬁ  c procedures for setting jets at  different density altitudes.  

# Four-Stroke Mixture Settings  

Four-stroke engines typically have automatic mixture control  for higher altitudes or a mixture control that can be operated  by the pilot.  

# Carburetor Icing  

One disadvantage of the carburetor system versus the fuel  injected system is its icing tendency. Carburetor ice occurs  due to the effect of fuel vaporization and the decrease in air  pressure in the venturi, which causes a sharp temperature  drop in the carburetor. If water vapor in the air condenses  when the carburetor temperature is at or below freezing, ice  may form on internal surfaces of the carburetor, including  the throttle valve.  

Ice generally forms in the vicinity of the venturi throat. This  restricts the ﬂ  ow of the fuel/air mixture (fuel/oil/air mixture  for two stroke) and reduces power. If enough ice builds up,  the engine may cease to operate. Carburetor ice is most likely  to occur when temperatures are below   $70\ ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$     $(21\ {}^{\circ}\mathbf{C})$   and  the relative humidity is above 80 percent. However, due to  the sudden cooling that takes place in the carburetor, icing  can occur even with temperatures as high as   $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\,(38\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$    and humidity as low as 50 percent. This temperature drop  can be as much as 60 to  $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  . Therefore, at an outside air  temperature of  $100\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  , a temperature drop of  $70\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$   results in  an air temperature in the carburetor of  $30\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$  .  [Figure 4-14]  

The ﬁ  rst indication of carburetor icing is a decrease in engine  rpm, which may be followed by engine roughness. Although  carburetor ice can occur during any phase of ﬂ  ight, it is  particularly dangerous when using reduced power during a  descent. Under certain conditions, carburetor ice could build  unnoticed until trying to add power. To combat the effects of  carburetor ice, some engines have a carburetor heat option.  Some of the newer four-stroke engines have carburetor heat  turned on all the time to combat icing. Two-stroke engines  are typically less susceptible to icing but speciﬁ  c installations  

![](images/c4415dba5143509834f162bc909c3a005c2d724ff2fc5d3f583f6c220f240a07.jpg)  
Figure 4-14.   Although carburetor ice is most likely to form when  temperature and humidity are in ranges indicated by this chart,  carburetor ice is also possible under conditions not depicted.  

dictate how susceptible the carburetor is to icing. Consult  the aircraft POH for the probability of carburetor ice for the  speciﬁ  c installation and for carburetor ice procedures.  

# Fuel Injection Induction Systems  

In a fuel injection system, the fuel is injected either directly  into the cylinders or just ahead of the intake valve. A fuel  injection system usually incorporates these basic components:  engine-driven fuel pump, fuel/air control unit, fuel manifold  (fuel distributor), discharge nozzles, auxiliary fuel pump, and  fuel pressure/ﬂ  ow indicators.  [Figure 4-15]  

The engine-driven fuel pump provides fuel under pressure  from the fuel tank to the fuel/air control unit. This control  unit, which essentially replaces the carburetor, meters the fuel  and sends it to the fuel manifold valve at a rate controlled  by the throttle. After reaching the fuel manifold valve, the  fuel is distributed to the individual fuel discharge nozzles.  The discharge nozzles, which are located in each cylinder  head, inject the fuel/air mixture at the precise time for each  cylinder directly into each cylinder intake port.  

Some of the advantages of fuel injection are:  

•   No carburetor icing. •   Better fuel ﬂ  ow. •   Faster throttle response. •   Precise control of mixture. •   Better fuel distribution. •   Easier cold weather starts.  

Disadvantages include:  

•   Difﬁ  culty in starting a hot engine. •   Vapor locks during ground operations on hot days. •   Problems associated with restarting an engine that  quits because of fuel starvation.  

![](images/099bf334f2b0a88e30546a92fbd2a658413833a2a38d5288e1f94d18525963ef.jpg)  
Figure 4-15.  Fuel injection system.  

# Ignition System  

The typical ignition system on WSC aircraft provides the  spark that ignites the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders and  is made up of magneto/generators, control boxes, spark  plugs, high-voltage leads, and the ignition switch. For most  LSA engines designed speciﬁ  cally for aircraft, a magneto/ generator uses a permanent magnet to generate an electric  current independent of the aircraft’s electrical system, which  might include a battery. The aircraft electrical system can  fail—the battery can go dead. However, this has no effect  on the ignition system.  

The electricity from the ignition magneto/generator goes into  the ignition control box where the correct voltage is produced  and timed to ﬁ  re the spark plugs at the proper time. Modern  WSC aircraft use an electronic capacitance discharge system  that operates without any moving parts to increase reliability  and efﬁ  ciency. Capacitance Digital Systems (CDI) operate  similarly but they have the ability to change the timing of the  spark for different rpm. Consult the POH for the particular  system for each engine.  

The system begins to ﬁ  re when the starter is engaged and the  crankshaft begins to turn. It continues to operate whenever  the crankshaft is rotating. Most WSC aircraft incorporate  a dual ignition system with two individual magneto/ generators, separate sets of wires, separate sets of control  boxes, and separate sets of spark plugs to increase reliability  of the ignition system. Each magneto/generator operates  independently to ﬁ  re one of the two spark plugs in each  cylinder. If one of the systems fails, the other is unaffected.  The engine will continue to operate normally, although a slight  decrease in engine power can be expected.  

The operation of the magneto/generator output to the ignition  system is controlled in the ﬂ  ight deck by the ignition switch.  Since there are two individual ignition systems, there are  normally two separate ignition toggle switches or separate  positions on the ignition control, as shown in  Figure 4-16.  

Identiﬁ  cation of a malfunctioning ignition system during  the pretakeoff check is observed by the decrease in rpm that  occurs when ﬁ  rst turning off one ignition switch, turning it  back on, and then turning off the other. A noticeable decrease  in engine rpm is normal during this check. If the engine  stops running when switching to one ignition system or if  the rpm drop exceeds the allowable limit, do not ﬂ  y until  the problem is corrected. The cause could be fouled plugs,  broken or shorted wires between the magneto/generator and  spark plugs, or improperly timed ﬁ  ring of the plugs because  of a defective control box. It should be noted that “no drop”  in rpm is not normal, and in that instance, the aircraft should  not be ﬂ  own. Following engine shutdown, keep the ignition  

![](images/e69521d06b1e516b772acff6be4c6b2020d72aad3cc7940a95701e6d06e78973.jpg)  
Figure 4-16.   Keyed ignition system with integral starter.  

switches in the OFF position. Even with the battery and  master switches OFF, the engine can ﬁ  re and turn over if  an ignition switch is left ON and the propeller is moved  because the magneto/generator requires no outside source  of electrical power. The potential for serious injury in this  situation is obvious.  

Standard category aircraft engine systems are described in  the Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge; however,  these engines are not typically used on WSC. Automobile  engines or other non aircraft engines may be used on WSC  where the ignition system runs off the battery rather than a  magneto/generator system. In this case if the battery system  fails, the engine ignition system will fail and the engine will  stop.  

# Combustion  

During normal combustion, the fuel/air mixture burns in  a very controlled and predictable manner. Although the  process occurs in a fraction of a second, the mixture actually  begins to burn at the point where it is ignited by the spark  plugs, then burns away from the plugs until it is consumed  completely. This type of combustion causes a smooth buildup  of temperature and pressure and ensures that the expanding  gases deliver the maximum force to the piston at exactly the  right time in the power stroke.  

Detonation is an uncontrolled, explosive ignition of the  fuel/air mixture within the cylinder’s combustion chamber.  It causes excessive temperatures and pressures which, if not  corrected, can quickly lead to failure of the piston, cylinder,  or valves. In less severe cases, detonation causes engine  overheating, roughness, or loss of power.  

Detonation is characterized by high cylinder head temperatures  and is most likely to occur when operating at high power  settings. Some common operational causes of detonation  include:  

•   Using a lower fuel grade than that speciﬁ  ed by the  aircraft manufacturer or operating the engine after  it has been sitting for an extended period; after 3  weeks or as indicated by the POH, drain old fuel and  replenish with fresh fuel. •   Operating the engine at high power settings with an  excessively lean mixture. •   Extended ground operations.  

Detonation may be avoided by following these basic  guidelines during the various phases of ground and ﬂ  ight  operations:  

•   Make sure the proper grade of fuel is being used. Drain  and refuel if the fuel is old. •   Develop a habit of monitoring the engine instruments  to verify proper operation according to procedures  established by the manufacturer.  

Preignition occurs when the fuel/air mixture ignites prior  to the engine’s normal ignition event. Premature burning  is usually caused by a residual hot spot in the combustion  chamber, often created by a small carbon deposit on a spark  plug, a cracked spark plug insulator, or other damage in the  cylinder that causes a part to heat sufﬁ  ciently to ignite the  fuel/air charge. Preignition causes the engine to lose power  and produces high operating temperature. As with detonation,  preignition may also cause severe engine damage because  the expanding gases exert excessive pressure on the piston  while still on its compression stroke.  

Detonation and preignition often occur simultaneously and  one may cause the other. Since either condition causes high  engine temperature accompanied by a decrease in engine  performance, it is often difﬁ  cult to distinguish between the  two. Using the recommended grade of fuel and operating the  engine within its proper temperature and RPM ranges reduce  the chance of detonation or preignition.  

# Fuel Systems  

The fuel system is designed to provide an uninterrupted ﬂ  ow  of clean fuel from the fuel tank to the engine. See Chapter  3, Components and Systems, for more information on fuel  tanks. See earlier section in this chapter for speciﬁ  cs on fuel  injection systems. The fuel must be available to the engine  under all conditions of engine power, altitude, attitude, and  during all approved ﬂ  ight maneuvers.  [Figure 4-17]

Figure 4-17.   Typical Carburetor Fuel System.  

# Fuel Pumps  

WSC aircraft with carburetors have engine-driven fuel pump  systems. A diaphragm pump is the primary pump in the fuel  system for two-stroke engines. Air pulses in the crankcase  actuate a diaphragm and provide fuel under pressure to the  carburetor. Four-stroke engines have a mechanical pump  driven directly off the engine.  

Sometimes an electric auxiliary pump is provided for use in  engine starting and in the event the engine pump fails. The  auxiliary pump, also known as a boost pump, provides added  reliability to the fuel system. The electric auxiliary pump is  controlled by a switch in the ﬂ  ight deck.  

# Fuel Plunger Primer  

The optional fuel plunger primer is used to draw fuel from  the tanks to supply it directly into the engine prior to starting.  This is particularly helpful during cold weather when engines  are hard to start because there is not enough heat available to  vaporize the fuel in the carburetor. For some aircraft, it is the  only way to deliver fuel to the engine when ﬁ  rst starting. After  the engine starts and is running, the fuel pump pushes fuel  to the carburetors and begins normal fuel delivery. To avoid  overpriming, read the priming instructions in the POH.  

# Choke  

A choke or fuel enriching system is an alternate method to  provide additional fuel to the engine for initial cold starting.  Actuating the choke control allows more fuel to ﬂ  ow into  the carburetor.  

# Fuel Bulb Primer  

The fuel bulb primer is manually actuated by squeezing the  bulb to draw fuel from the fuel tanks. This charges the fuel  lines and carburetor ﬂ  oat bowls before starting the engine  the ﬁ  rst time on a given day. After the engine starts, the fuel  pump is able to deliver the fuel to the fuel bowls. An electric  auxiliary fuel pump can also be used to charge the fuel lines  and carburetor fuel bowls before starting. This auxiliary fuel  pump is also used as a backup pump of the engine driven  fuel pump fails.  

# Fuel Gauges  

The fuel quantity gauge indicates the amount of fuel measured  by a sensing unit in each fuel tank and is displayed in gallons.  Do not depend solely on the accuracy of the fuel quantity  gauge. Always visually check the fuel level in the tank  during the preﬂ  ight inspection, and then compare it with the  corresponding fuel quantity indication. It is also important  to track inﬂ  ight fuel consumption. Be sure to consult the  POH and know the approximate consumption rate to ensure  sufﬁ  cient fuel for ﬂ  ight. If an auxiliary electric fuel pump is  installed in the fuel system, a fuel pressure gauge is sometimes  included. This gauge indicates the pressure in the fuel lines.  The normal operating pressure can be found in the POH.  

# Fuel Filter  

After leaving the fuel tank, the fuel passes through a ﬁ  lter  before it enters the fuel pump or carburetor. This ﬁ  lter  removes sediments that might be in the fuel.  [Figure 4-18]  

# Fuel  

Aviation gasoline (AVGAS) is identiﬁ  ed by an octane or  performance number (grade) which designates the antiknock  value or knock resistance of the fuel mixture in the engine  

![](images/53cceddb5665206e58ebd9955b6263da404f43ddaedf9e7f8a91592e37e0d74c.jpg)

cylinder. The higher the grade of gasoline, the more pressure  the fuel can withstand without detonating. Lower grades of  fuel are used in lower compression engines because these  fuels ignite at a lower temperature. Higher grades are used  in higher compression engines, because they must ignite  at higher temperatures but not prematurely. If the proper  grade of fuel is not available, use the next higher grade as  a substitute. Never use a lower grade. This can cause the  cylinder head temperature to exceed its normal operating  range, which may result in detonation. Unfortunately,  AVGAS 100 Low Lead (LL) may not be recommended by  two-stroke engine manufacturers and may not be preferred by  the four-stroke manufactures. Even though the “LL” stands for  low lead, 100LL contains more lead than the old leaded gas  dispensed at automotive ﬁ  lling stations. The lead in the fuel  leaves deposits in the piston ring grooves, freezing the rings  in position and reducing engine performance. Spark plugs are  also very susceptible to lead fouling. This is especially true  in two-stroke engines that use cooler ignition temperatures  than standard aircraft engines.  

AVGAS does have some advantages. It degrades slower  than auto gas, maintaining its efﬁ  ciency for a full 3 months.  AVGAS 100LL has no seasonal or regional variations and is  manufactured according to a standardized “recipe” worldwide.  If the airport has only 100LL available, it is permissible,  absent any limitations of the engine manufacturer, to mix  100LL and auto gasoline for use in two-stroke engines. A  50–50 ratio will boost the octane rating and limit the amount  of lead available for fouling. Generally speaking, this is a  reasonable compromise when the proper auto gas octane is  not available.  

Manufacturers of two-stroke engines and four-stroke engines  used on WSC aircraft typically recommend the use of 89  octane minimum auto fuel for their engines. Additives are  put into auto gas primarily to reduce harmful emissions rather  than boost performance. The additives are supposed to be  listed at the pump, but the accuracy of this posting should  be questioned.  

Methanol alcohol has corrosive properties and can damage  engines. Engine manufacturers do not recommend more than  ﬁ  ve percent methanol in fuel. Consult the POH for speciﬁ  cs  on an engine.  

Ethanol alcohol is less corrosive than methanol. However, it  attracts water and is not as economical as gasoline. Ethanol  does not get very good fuel economy. Avoid fuels with any  more than 10 percent of ethanol.  

Consult the POH for speciﬁ  cs on an engine. Manufacturers  provide speciﬁ  c recommendations for the percentage of  alcohol in fuel. The posting on the pump may not be accurate  and alcohol content can vary greatly between fuel brands and  stations. Additionally, higher percentages of alcohol will be  added to auto gas in the future.  

A simple test can be conducted to measure the fuel’s  alcohol content to ensure the fuel used stays within the  manufacturer’s recommendations. Use a general aviation  sump collector which includes graduation marks. Add water  to a speciﬁ  c mark. Then add fuel to ﬁ  ll the collector up to  the line for gas. Cover the top and shake it vigorously. After  it settles, the water and alcohol will combine and it will  look like there is now more water in the sump collector.  The difference between the initial amount of water ﬁ  rst put  into the collector and the new level of combined water and  alcohol equals the amount of alcohol in the fuel. Compare  this amount of alcohol and the amount of fuel to determine  the percentage of alcohol content in the fuel.  

Methyl tertiary–butyl ether (MTBE) does not have the  corrosive or water attractive properties of the previously  mentioned additives and is added to fuel to improve air  quality. It has been banned in several states because it is  carcinogenic and has been found in ground water. It does not  attract water, but it is expensive, and found only in some of  the better grade fuels.  

# Fuel Contamination  

Clean fuel is imperative for the safe operation of a WSC  aircraft. Of the accidents attributed to powerplant failure from  fuel contamination, most have been traced to:  

•   Failure to remove contamination from the fuel system  during preﬂ  ight. •   Servicing aircraft with improperly ﬁ  ltered fuel from  small tanks or drums. •   Storing aircraft with partially ﬁ  lled fuel tanks. •   Lack of proper maintenance.  

Rust is common in metal fuel containers and is a common  fuel contaminant. Metal fuel tanks should be ﬁ  lled after each  ﬂ  ight, or at least after the last ﬂ  ight of the day to prevent  moisture condensation within the tank.  

Another way to prevent fuel contamination is to avoid  refueling from cans and drums. Use a water ﬁ  ltering funnel  or a funnel with a chamois skin when refueling from cans or  drums. However, the use of a chamois will not always ensure  decontaminated fuel. Worn out chamois will not ﬁ  lter water;  neither will a new, clean chamois that is already water-wet or  damp. Most imitation chamois skins will not ﬁ  lter water.  

# Bad Gasoline  

Letting fuel sit for weeks without using it will cause it to go  bad. Even if gas does not go bad, it will often lose octane  with time. For premixed gasoline and two-stroke oil, there  is another set of problems. Fuel and oil are normally mixed  at a 50:1 ratio. If premixed gas sits in a plastic container for  a while, the gas will evaporate leaving a richer oil mixture  in the container. In any case, fresh gas should be used when  possible.  

# Refueling Procedures  

Never mix oil and fuel in an enclosed area. Not only are the  fumes irritating, but with the right fuel/air mixture can cause  an explosion. Do all oil and gas mixing outside. Refueling  from fuel cans should also be done outside. Never smoke  while refueling. Be careful when refueling an aircraft that has  just landed. There is danger of spilling fuel on a hot engine  component, particularly an exhaust system component.  Refueling should be done using only safety-approved fuel  containers marked with the type of fuel stored in them.  Confusing premixed fuel and fuel that has no oil in it can  be disastrous.  

# Metal Versus Plastic Fuel Containers  

There are advantages to using both metal and plastic  containers. Metal cans will not allow the sun’s ultraviolet  rays in to harm the fuel. It also will not develop static charges  that a plastic container develops. However, a metal can is  more prone to sweating when going from cool to warm  temperatures on humid days. Metal cans and gas tanks are  best kept either empty or full of fuel to leave no room for  moist air.  

Plastic fuel containers are easy to handle, inexpensive,  available at discount stores, and do not scratch the ﬁ  nish on  airframes. Plastic cans also do not sweat, and do not need to  be stored topped off. However, fuel does deteriorate a little  faster in plastic. Also, plastic containers can get charged  with static electricity while sliding around in the bed of a  pickup truck, especially if the truck has a plastic bed liner.  [Figure 4-19]  

![](images/c85344a3abe6865e94180d3f08fe19484690b90f3c38c9382198e42ee6254bfb.jpg)  
Figure 4-19.   With these translucent containers, it can be noted that  the left hand container is just auto fuel and the right hand container  shows the auto fuel is premixed with oil for a two-stroke engine.  

Many states now have laws prohibiting people from ﬁ  lling  plastic containers unless ﬁ  rst placed on the ground. Static  electricity can also be formed by the friction of air passing  over the surfaces of a WSC aircraft in ﬂ  ight and by the  ﬂ  ow of fuel through the hose and nozzle during refueling,  if fueling at a pump. Nylon, Dacron, and wool clothing are  especially prone to accumulate and discharge static electricity  from the person to the funnel or nozzle. To guard against the  possibility of static electricity igniting fuel fumes, a ground  wire should be attached to the aircraft before the fuel cap is  removed from the tank. The refueling nozzle should then  be grounded to the aircraft before refueling is begun and  should remain grounded throughout the refueling process.  

The passage of fuel through a chamois increases the charge  of static electricity and the danger of sparks.  

The aircraft must be properly grounded and the nozzle,  chamois ﬁ  lter, and funnel bonded to the aircraft. If a can is  used, it should be connected to either the grounding post or  the funnel. Cell phones should not be used while refueling  due to possible ﬁ  re risks.  

# Mixing Two-Stroke Oil and Fuel  

Two-stroke engines require special two-stroke oil to be mixed  into the fuel before entering the engine to provide lubrication.  In some engines, an oil injection pump is used to deliver the  exact amount of oil into the intake of the engine depending  on the throttle setting. An advantage of an oil injection  system is that pilots do not need to premix any oil into the  fuel. However, an important preﬂ  ight check is to ensure the  two-stroke oil reservoir is properly ﬁ  lled.  

If a two-stroke engine does not have an oil injection system,  it is critical to mix the oil with the fuel before it is put into  the tank. Just pouring oil into the fuel tank does not allow  the oil to mix with the gas, and makes it difﬁ  cult to measure  the proper amount of oil for mixing.  

# To mix two-stroke oil:  

•   Find a clean, approved container. Pour some gas into  it to help pre-dilute the two-stroke oil. •   Pour in a known amount of two-stroke oil into the  container. Oil should be approved for air-cooled  engines at 50:1 mixing ratio (check the engine  manufacturer for proper fuel to oil ratio for the WSC  aircraft). Use a measuring cup if necessary. Shake the  oil-gas mixture to dilute the oil with gasoline. •   Add gasoline until the 50:1 ratio is reached. If using a  water separating funnel, ensure the funnel is grounded  or at least in contact with the fuel container. •   Put the cap on the fuel can and shake the gasoline and  oil mixture thoroughly.  

# Starting System  

Most small aircraft use a direct-cranking electric starter  system. This system consists of a source of electricity, wiring,  switches, and solenoids to operate the starter and a starter  motor. The starter engages the aircraft ﬂ  ywheel or gearbox,  rotating the engine at a speed that allows the engine to start  and maintain operation.  

Electrical power for starting is usually supplied by an on-board  battery. When the battery switch is turned ON, electricity is  supplied to the main power bus through the battery solenoid.  Both the starter and the starter switch draw current from the  main bus, but the starter will not operate until the starting  solenoid is energized by the starter switch being turned to the 

 “start” position. When the starter switch is released from the 

 “start” position, the solenoid removes power from the starter  motor. The starter motor is protected from being driven by  the engine through a clutch in the starter drive that allows  the engine to run faster than the starter motor.  

# Oil Systems  

In a four-stroke engine, the engine oil system performs  several important functions, including:  

•   Lubricating the engine’s moving parts. •   Cooling the engine by reducing friction. •   Removing heat from the cylinders. •   Providing a seal between the cylinder walls and  pistons. •   Carrying away contaminants.  

Four-stroke engines use either a wet sump or dry sump  oil system. Refer to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge for more information on four-stroke oil  systems.  

# Engine Cooling Systems  

The burning fuel within the cylinders produces intense heat,  most of which is expelled through the exhaust system. Much  of the remaining heat, however, must be removed, or at least  dissipated, to prevent the engine from overheating.  

While the oil system in a four-stroke engine and the fuel-oil  mix in a two-stroke engine is vital to the internal cooling of  the engine, an additional method of cooling is necessary for  the engine’s external surface. WSC engines operate with  either air-cooled or liquid-cooled systems.  

Many WSC aircraft are equipped with a cylinder head  temperature (CHT) gauge. This instrument indicates a direct  and immediate cylinder temperature change. This instrument  is calibrated in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Proper CHT  ranges can be found in the POH/AFM/AOI for that machine.  [Figure 4-20]  

Air cooling is accomplished by air being pulled into the  engine shroud by a cooling fan. Bafﬂ  es route this air over  ﬁ  ns attached to the engine cylinders where the air absorbs the  engine heat. Expulsion of the hot air takes place through one  or more openings in the shroud. If cylinder head temperatures  rise too much in an air-cooled engine, it is because of  lubrication problems, cooling fan drive belt damage or wear,  

![](images/43d8a33ce06693d819dbd48aa1c7beea6c6dd73b3cdde7a79d1d209f96467b4b.jpg)

or air blockage in the cooling ﬁ  ns by a bird or insect nest.  [Figure 4-1]

Figure 4-21.   Cooling radiators—oil cooler is on top and water  cooler is on bottom.  

Liquid cooling systems pump coolant through jackets in  the cylinders and head. The heated liquid is then routed to  a radiator where the heat is radiated to the atmosphere. The  cooled liquid is then returned to the engine. If the radiator is  mounted close to the propeller, the propeller can constantly  move air across the radiator and keep the engine cool even  when the WSC is not moving.  [Figure 4-21]  Radiators  mounted away from the propeller make it more difﬁ  cult for  the radiator to cool the engine unless the WSC is moving.  [Figure 4-22]  

Breaking in an engine through ground runs on a hot day  is when radiator placement is most critical. Liquid-cooled  engines can overheat for a number of reasons, such as coolant  

![](images/7d66acb3105c888b9b9ad9a596042e400d8fd6ba33ceaa019d05bca4b2adc724.jpg)

not at proper levels, a leak, failed water pump, or a blockage  of the radiator.  

Operating an engine above its maximum design temperature  can cause a loss of power and detonation. It will also lead  to serious permanent damage, such as scoring the cylinder  walls and damaging the pistons and rings. Monitor the engine  temperature instruments to avoid high operating temperature.  Operating the engine lower than its designed temperature  range can cause piston seizure and scarring on the cylinder  walls. This happens most often in liquid-cooled WSC aircraft  in cold weather where large radiators designed for summer  ﬂ  ying may need to be partially blocked off.  

# Chapter Summary  

Powerplants are generally classiﬁ  ed by:  

1.  Number of piston strokes needed to complete a  cycle—two strokes or four strokes. 2.  Method of cooling—liquid or air.  

Exhaust systems route the exhaust gases from the cylinders  out to the atmosphere. Two-stroke engines require tuned  exhaust systems matched to the speciﬁ  c engine for proper  operation.  

Engines must be warmed up properly or engine damage  and seizure can result. Gearboxes reduce the engine rpm to  a usable propeller rpm. Induction systems mix gas and air  for cylinders and must be properly adjusted for different  altitudes.  

Typical aircraft ignition systems are separate from the  electrical systems and typically have two separate ignition  systems. Aircraft ignition systems are composed of a  magneto/generator, control box, high voltage wires, spark  plugs, and ignition switches. Automotive engines typically  run the ignition system off the battery.  

Proper combustion is a result of proper mixture and good  fuel. Good fuel management and proper engine cooling are  important considerations for reliable engine operation.  

# Preﬂ  ight and  Ground Operations  

# Introduction  

Preﬂ  ight preparations should include the overall evaluation  of the:  

•  P ilot: experience, sleep, food and water, drugs or  medications, stress, illness •  A ircraft: certiﬁ  cates/documents, airworthiness, fuel,  weight (does not exceed maximum), performance  requirements, equipment •  En V ironment: weather conditions, density altitude,  forecast for departure and destination airﬁ  elds, route  of ﬂ  ight, runway lengths •  E xternal pressures: schedules, available alternatives,  purpose of ﬂ  ight  

Often remembered as   PAVE, it is important to consider each  of these factors and establish personal minimums for ﬂ  ying.  

# Where To Fly  

The weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft can be transported by  trailer from one ﬂ  ying ﬁ  eld to the next. For as many beneﬁ  ts  as this provides, transporting the aircraft into unfamiliar  territory also includes some safety and operational issues.  

Contact airport management to inquire about any special  arrangements to be made prior to arriving by trailer  [Figure 5-1]  and there may be special considerations for  ﬂ  ying WSC aircraft with other aircraft. With smaller patterns  typically used by WSC aircraft, as covered in Chapter 10,  Airport Trafﬁ  c Patterns, airport management may want a  pilot to operate over sparsely populated areas rather than  the normal airplane patterns over congested areas because  of the unique noise of the WSC aircraft.  [Figure 5-2]  Check  the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD) all required airport  information per Title 14 of the Code of federal Regulations  (14 CFR) part 91 section 103, Preﬂ  ight information. Some  operation examples are trafﬁ  c pattern information, noise  abatement procedures , no ﬂ  y zones surrounding the airport,  and special accommodations that may need to be arranged  for WSC aircraft..  

Because of the wide range of flying characteristics of  the WSC aircraft, inform local pilots about some of the  incidentals of the speciﬁ  c WSC aircraft (e.g., ﬂ  ying low and  slow for certain conﬁ  gurations). The more non-WSC aircraft  pilots know about WSC ﬂ  ight characteristics and intentions,  the better they understand how to cooperate in ﬂ  ight. Sharing  the same airspace with various aircraft categories requires  pilots to know and understand the rules and understand the  ﬂ  ight characteristics and performance limitations of the  different aircraft.  

![](images/4c809893f74ea290bea70980c383f180fdec1747f5a641b6a959ca3d98c1d502.jpg)  
Figure 5-2.   Contact local airport management to determine best operation for the aircraft and its type of operation.

Figure 5-1.   Contact the local airport management to find an acceptable location to stay at the airport.  

For operations at nonaircraft ﬁ  elds, special considerations  must be evaluated. Permission is necessary to use private  property as an airstrip. Locate the area on an aeronautical  sectional chart to check for possible airspace violations or  unusual hazards that could arise by not knowing the terrain  or location. Avoid loitering around residential structures and  animal enclosures because of the slow ﬂ  ight characteristics  of WSC aircraft and distinct engine noise.  

While selecting a takeoff position, make certain the approach  and takeoff paths are clear of other aircraft. Fences, power  lines, trees, buildings, and other obstacles should not be in the  immediate ﬂ  ightpath unless the pilot is certain he or she is able  to safely clear them during takeoff and landing operations.  

Walk the entire length of the intended takeoff and landing area  prior to departure.  [Figure 5-3]  Look for holes, muddy spots,  rocks, dips in the terrain, high grass, and other objects that can  cause problems during takeoff and landing. Physically mark  areas of concern with paint, ﬂ  ags, or cones. Uneven ground,  mud, potholes, or items in ﬁ  elds such as rocks might not be  visible from the air. Plowed rows and vegetation are larger  than they appear from the air. Unfamiliar ﬁ  elds can make  suitable landing areas for emergencies, but should not be used  as intended landing areas. Extreme caution must be exercised  when operating from a new ﬁ  eld or area for the ﬁ  rst time.  

![](images/68e6b9e3d77367f2dc657de25bae0d722308590926b310a9347f5d5fc5359844.jpg)  
Figure 5-3.   Fields that look like good landing areas from the air  may actually be hazardous.  

# Preﬂ  ight Actions  

A pilot must become familiar with all available information  concerning the ﬂ  ight, including runway lengths at airport of  intended use, takeoff and landing distance accounting for  airport elevation and runway slope, aircraft gross weight,  wind, and temperature. For a cross-country ﬂ  ight not in the  vicinity of the takeoff/departure airport, information must  include weather reports and forecasts, fuel requirements,  and alternatives available if the planned ﬂ  ight cannot be  completed.  

# Weather  

Weather is a determining factor for all ﬂ  ight operations.  Before any ﬂ  ight is considered, pilots should obtain regional  and local information to ﬁ  rst determine if the predicted  weather for the planned ﬂ  ight is safe.  

# Regional Weather  

Understanding the overall weather in the region being  ﬂ  own provides an overview of conditions and how they can  change during ﬂ  ight. Fronts, pressure systems, isobars, and  the jet stream determine the weather. There are a number of  information resources from which to ﬁ  nd the regional view  of weather systems, observed and predicted. Surface analysis  charts show these regional systems, which are common on  weather internet sites and TV broadcasts.  [Figure 5-4]  Review  the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for a  comprehensive understanding of weather theory, reports,  forecasts, and charts for weather concepts covered throughout  this weather section.  

![](images/9611cc4d619202469a8e557bc49064f35181eaa1f697590ffb9342eeff09a32a.jpg)  
Figure 5-4.   Standard surface analysis showing fronts, pressure  systems, and isobars (top) and composite surface analysis which  adds radar and infrared satellite to show cloud cover (bottom).  

There are many sources for obtaining a weather brieﬁ  ng,  such as www.aviationweather.gov, www.nws.noaa.gov, 1- 800-WX-BRIEF, and a variety of internet sites that specialize  in local and regional weather.  

# Local Conditions  

In gathering weather information for a ﬂ  ight, obtain current  and forecast conditions where ﬂ  ying, as well as alternate  airports in case landing at the intended destination is not  possible. These conditions should include wind (surface and  winds aloft), moisture, stability, and pressure.  

Surface wind predictions and observations can be looked  at with a number of internet resources. The National  Weather Aviation service provides observations (METAR)  and forecasts (TAF) for areas with weather reporting  capabilities.  

Winds aloft are forecast winds at higher altitudes than the  surface for locations throughout the United States. Refer  to the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for an  understanding of the winds and temperatures aloft tables.  Winds aloft, too, are important for flight planning and  safety.  

A typical situation during morning hours is cold air from the  night settling, creating calm winds at the surface with the  winds aloft (300 to 3,000 feet) at 30 knots. As the surface  begins to warm from the sun, the cold surface air starts to  warm and rise, allowing the high winds from above to mix  and lower to the surface. The wind sheer area in between the  high winds above and calm winds below is usually turbulent  and can overwhelm aircraft or pilot capabilities. Therefore,  it is a dangerous practice to look only at the wind sock for  surface winds when there could be strong winds above. Winds  aloft must be evaluated for safe ﬂ  ight.  [Figure 5-5]  

During initial solo ﬂ  ights, the wind should be relatively calm  to ﬂ  y safely. As experience is gained, pilot wind limitations  can be increased. It is not until the pilot has had dual training  in crosswinds, bumpy conditions, and signiﬁ  cant pilot in  command (PIC) time soloing in mild conditions that pilot  wind conditions should approach the aircraft limitations. A  safe pilot understands aircraft and personal limitations.  

Moisture in the air has a signiﬁ  cant effect on weather. If  the relative humidity is high, the chance of clouds forming  at lower altitudes is more likely. Clouds forming at lower  altitudes create visibility problems that can create Instrument  Meteorological Conditions (IMC) in which the visibility is  below that required for safe ﬂ  ight. The temperature-dew point  spread is the basis for determining at what altitude moisture  condenses and clouds form. It is important to be particularly  watchful for low visibilities when the air and dew point  temperatures are within a spread of three to four degrees.  

![](images/91daab689b517180b2b8bbd8e8d617b83c008900c3b5ed09d3d429ecc118b2ae.jpg)  
Figure 5-5.   Typical morning inversion layer—calm cold air is below; high winds are above.  

The closer these temperatures are to each other, the greater  the chance for fog or clouds forming with reduced visibility  conditions. Consider a scenario where the destination airport  currently has a temperature-dew point spread of  $4\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  , and it  is evening when the atmosphere is cooling down. Since the  temperature-dew point convergence rate is   $4.4^{\circ}$   for every  thousand feet, the clouds/ceiling would be about 1,000  feet above ground level (AGL). Since it is cooling down,  the temperature-dew point spread is decreasing, lowering  the cloud level. Therefore, the 1,000 foot AGL ceiling is  lowering, creating IMC conditions that are not safe. For this  scenario, the ﬂ  ight should not be attempted.  

Air temperature and humidity directly affect the performance  of the WSC wing and engine. The higher the temperature,  humidity, and actual altitude of the operating ﬁ  eld, the greater  role density altitude plays in determining how much runway  the WSC aircraft needs to get off the ground with the load  on board, and how much climb performance is required once  airborne. The WSC aircraft may have cleared the obstacle  at  $8\;\mathrm{a.m}$  . when the weather conditions were cooler with less  humidity; at  $1\,\mathrm{p.m}$  . with increased air temperature and higher  humidity levels, the pilot must reevaluate the performance  of that same aircraft. A full understanding of density altitude  is necessary to be a safe WSC pilot; refer to the Pilot’s  Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge for density altitude  and weight effects on performance.  

The rate of temperature decrease with increased altitude  determines the stability of the air. The stability of the air  determines the vertical air currents that develop during the  day as the area is heated by the sun. These rising vertical  air currents are commonly known as thermals. Generally,  stable air has mild thermals and therefore less turbulence  than unstable air. Unstable air rises faster, creating greater  turbulence. Highly unstable air rises rapidly and, with enough  moisture, can build into thunderstorms.  

Air stability is easily determined by the rate at which the  temperature drops with increased altitude. A standard  atmosphere is where the temperature drops  $2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   for every  1,000 foot increase. If the temperature drops less than  $2\,^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$  per thousand feet, the air is more stable with less vertical wind  (thermals) developed during the day. If the temperature drops  more than  $2~^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   per thousand feet, the air is more unstable  with more powerful vertical air currents developed during  the day, creating greater turbulence.  

In addition to air stability, barometric pressure has a large  effect on weather. Low pressure in the area, below the  standard atmosphere of   $29.92~"\mathrm{Hg}$  , is generally rising air  with dynamic and unsettled weather. High pressure above  the standard atmosphere in the area is generally sinking air  resulting in good weather for ﬂ  ying.  

Many airports have automated weather systems in which  pilots can call the automated weather sensor platforms that  collect weather data at airports and listen to this information  via radio and/or land line. Radio frequencies are on the  sectional chart and the A/FD has the telephone numbers  for these stations. The systems currently available are the  Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Automated  Weather Sensor System (AWSS), and Automated Weather  Observation System (AWOS).  

Local conditions of wind, moisture, stability, and barometric  pressure are factors that should be researched before ﬂ  ight to  make a competent decision of go or no go to ﬂ  y. High winds  and moist unstable air with a low barometric pressure indicate  undesirable ﬂ  ying conditions. Light winds and dry stable air  with high pressure indicate favorable ﬂ  ying conditions.  

Pilots should research and document these local conditions  before ﬂ  ight to predict the ﬂ  ying conditions and compare  the actual ﬂ  ying conditions to the predictions to learn and  develop knowledge from the information resources available  for ﬂ  ight.  

In addition to weather, the National Airspace needs to be  checked to ensure there are no temporary ﬂ  ight restrictions  (TFR) for the locations planned to ﬂ  y. TFRs may be found  at www.tfr.faa.gov/. For a complete preﬂ  ight brieﬁ  ng of  weather and TFRs, call 1-800-WX-BRIEF.  

Clouds visually tell what the air is doing, which provides  valuable information for any flight. To understand the  different cloud formations and the ground/air effects  produced, refer to weather theory in the Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge.  [Figure 5-6]  Cloud clearance and  visibility should be maintained for the operations intended  to be conducted. The chapter covering the National Airspace  System (NAS) provides cloud clearance requirements in  each class of airspace. A pilot should not ﬂ  y when ground  and ﬂ  ight visibility are below minimums for his or her pilot  certiﬁ  cate and the class of airspace where operating.  

Knowledge of mechanical turbulence and how to determine  where it can occur is also important. The lee side of objects  can feel turbulence from the wind up to ten times the height  of the object. The stronger the wind is, the stronger the  turbulence is.  [Figures 5-7  and  5-8]  

In addition to adhering to the regulations and manufacturer  recommendations for weather conditions, it is important to  develop a set of personal minimums such as wind limitations,  time of day, and temperature-dew point spread. These  minimums will evolve as a pilot gains experience and are  also dependent on recency and currency in the make/model  of aircraft being ﬂ  own.

# Weight and Loading  

Weight and loading must be considered before each ﬂ  ight.  Do not exceed the maximum gross weight as speciﬁ  ed in the  pilot’s operating handbook (POH). The balance of the pilot,  passenger, fuel, and baggage is usually not an issue, but must  be reviewed in the POH for the speciﬁ  c make/model since  some may have balance limitations. The fore and aft carriage  attachment to the wing hang point must be within the limits as  speciﬁ  ed in the POH for weight and loading of the carriage.  Always follow the POH performance limitations.  

# Transporting  

It is best to keep the WSC aircraft in an enclosed hangar, but  trailers may be used to transport, store, and retrieve the WSC  carriage. If the trailer is large enough, the wing can also ﬁ  t  inside the trailer. If not, then it must ﬁ  t on top of a trailer,  truck, or recreational vehicle (RV).  [Figure 5-9]  

![](images/01073a41616005a845710ddc7cef19ccba83e64109acf5d0bfcfb0ceb7f300fb.jpg)  
Figure 5-9.   Enclosed trailer containing carriage and wing on top  of RV.  

Enclosed trailers are preferred so the carriage is protected  from the outside elements such as dust, rain, mud, road debris,  and the interested person who may want to tinker with the  carriage. The WSC carriage should ﬁ  t snuggly without being  forced, be guarded against chaﬁ  ng, and well secured within  any trailer. It is best to utilize hard points on the carriage  frame and secure each wheel so the carriage cannot move  fore and aft during transport. This is best accomplished by  ﬁ  rst tying the front wheel from the axles, the fork, or a hard  point on the frame with a slight forward pull. Then, secure the  rear wheels from the axles or a hard point on the frame with  a slight rearward pull. Guides on the side of the wheels and  wheel chocks in front and back of each wheel are additionally  helpful to secure the carriage on any trailer.  

The wing must have ample padding and should have at least  three support points where it rests for transport. Transporting  the wing properly is of critical importance because the wing  resting on any hard surface can wear a hole in the sail and  cause structural damage to the tubing. The greatest wear and  tear on a wing can occur during transportation. Each support  point should have equal pressure—no single point taking  most of the load. The wing should be tied down at each  attachment point to secure it, but not tight enough to damage  the wing. Wide straps are better than thin ropes because the  greater width creates less concentrated pressure on the wing  at each tie-down point.  

Once the loading of the carriage and wing is complete  [Figure 5-9] , take a short drive, stop, and check for rubbing  or chaﬁ  ng of components.  

Prior to taking the tow vehicle and trailer on the road, inspect  the tires for proper inﬂ  ation and adequate tread. Ensure  all lights are operable, the hitch is free moving and well  lubricated, the tow vehicle attachment is rated for the weight  of the trailer, and the vehicle and trailer brakes are operable.  Avoid towing with too much or too little tongue weight,  which causes the trailer to ﬁ  shtail at certain speeds, possibly  rendering it uncontrollable.  

Be extremely cautious when unloading the wing and carriage.  This is best done with two people since the wing usually  weighs more than 100 pounds  [Figure 5-10]  and the carriage  

![](images/4c56491fcb84a3c7d90f4a537048e6568ddb0be532f9840c5484e79dbe856696.jpg)  
Figure 5-10.   Crane used for one person to lift 110-pound wing on  top of RV for transport.  

usually must roll down some incline to get from the trailer  to the ground. Some carriages may be tail heavy without the  wing, and caution must be exercised, especially moving up and  down ramps. Check propeller clearance on the ground when  transitioning onto or off of a ramp and propeller clearance going  into and out of an enclosed trailer. If the carriage is transported  in an open trailer, it should be covered and the propeller secured  so it does not rotate/windmill during transport.  

# Setting Up the WSC Aircraft  

Find a suitable area to set up the wing, such as grass,  cement, or pavement out of the wind. Inside a large hangar  is preferable since wind gusts are not a problem. If setting  up outside, align the wing perpendicular to the wind.  Most wings set up with the same basic procedure shown  in  Figures 5-11  through  5-33,  but the POH should be  referenced for the speciﬁ  c WSC aircraft.  

Rotate  the  wing  bag  so  the  zipper  is  facing  up.   [Figure  5-11]  Unzip  the bag. When setting up the wing, pay close attention to  the specific pads, where they are located, and how they  are attached for each component of the wing. As shown in  Figure 5-12,  the padding is made specifically for the control  frame between the downtubes and the control bar. If every  pad is not utilized when taking it down and transporting, there

will be wear on components with cosmetic and/or structural  damage to the wing. The POH may specify where pads go  during the setup and takedown. However, when setting up  any wing it is a good idea to take pictures, draw sketches, or  take notes regarding protective pad location so they can be  put back in the proper location during take down.  

Assemble the triangular control frame without attaching the  wires to the nose.  [Figure 5-13]  Rotate the wing up onto its  control frame.  [Figure 5-14]  Place the front wires near the  control bar so no one walks on them, remove, and roll up  the cover bag.  [Figure 5-15]  Release the wing tie straps that  are holding the leading edges together.  [Figure 5-16]  Spread  the wing slightly. Remove the pads from the wing keel and  kingpost. Note the protective pads still on the wing tips  protecting them from the ground during most of the wing  set up procedure.  [Figure 5-17]  Continually manage the  wing pads and wing tie straps by rolling the pads into the  cover bag so they do not blow away.  [Figure 5-18]  If the  kingpost is loose, insert it onto the keel to stand upright. If  the kingpost is attached, swing it upright. Topless wings  have no kingpost. Spread the wings as necessary to keep  the kingpost straight up,  [Figure 5-19]  spreading them out

Lift up the nose and let the carriage roll backward until the  wing is level and the control bar is in front of the front wheel  of the carriage. Engage the parking brake and chock the back  of the carriage wheels. Ensure everything in the ﬂ  ight deck is  free and clear so the wing can be lifted freely into position.  [Figure 5-30]  Lift the wing into position and lock the  carriage mast. This position is unique to each manufacturer  as some masts hinge above the ﬂ  ight deck.

An alternate method of setting up the wing is to do so on the  ground. This is not preferable because the sail is susceptible to  getting dirty. However, this method could be used for setting  up wings if it is windy or if recommended by a particular  manufacturer. The ground method steps are the same as  

![](images/5e40adb6d82095e305b95647d8f21fb386c4a9971b0a2294491c8f00ea35c415.jpg)

those in the assembly procedure except after the control bar  is assembled, the wing is rolled over so the control frame is  under the wing. The wing is assembled as if it were standing  on its control frame. After the wing is tensioned, the nose is  lifted, the control frame pulled forward, and the nose wire  secured. This is not a common practice, and the POH should  be reviewed for details on this method if it is allowed by the  manufacturer.  

# Taking Down the WSC Aircraft  

Find a suitable area to take down the wing, preferably grass,  cement, or pavement out of the wind. The best place is in  a large hangar so no wind gusts can affect the takedown. If  outside, align the wing perpendicular to the wind.  

It is important to note that during the take down process, all  protective pads must be put in the proper place so that no  hardware can rub against the sail or frame during transport.  The POH should specify what pads go where. Overall,  pad everything along the wing keel plus the kingpost to  prevent cosmetic and/or structural damage occurring during  transport.  

Taking down a WSC aircraft is done in the reverse order of  assembly with the following additional steps provided to get  the wing neatly packed and organized into the bag. After the  wing is detensioned and the battens have been removed from  the wing, keep the right and left battens separate for easier  sorting during the next assembly.  

Carefully bring the wings in towards the keel and pull the sail  material out and over the top of the leading edges. Lower the  kingpost and pad it top and bottom. This is also the time to  pad the area underneath where the control frame is attached  to the keel and where the wires are attached to the rear of  the keel.  [Figure 5-34]  Bring the leading edges to the keel  and keep the sail pulled out over the top of the leading edge,  roll it up, and tuck the sail into the leading edge stiffener.  Fasten around the leading edge with sail ties.  [Figure 5-35]  It  is best to take one sail tie and secure the two leading edges  together so it fits into the bag.  [Figure 5-36]  Continue with  the reverse order (bag on, flip wing over, and disassemble  control frame at downtube and control bar junction). After  the control frame is disassembled and laid flat along the wing  as shown, the wires are not organized.  [Figure 5-37]  Pull  the cables forward towards the nose and organize them so  they are straight. Install the protective control frame pads  and carefully zip up the bag while tucking everything in so  there is no stress on the zipper.  [Figure 5-38]

# Wing Tuning  

Wings are designed to fly straight with a range of trim speeds  determined by the manufacturer. If the wing does not fly  straight or trim to the manufacturer’s specifications, it must  be tuned to fly properly. Any wing adjustment can change the  handling and stability characteristics of the wing. Each wing  is unique and the tuning procedures are unique for each wing.  It is very important to follow the specific tuning procedures  in the POH/AFM for the specific wing. The following are  general guidelines to understand the tuning process.  

# Tuning the Wing To Fly Straight  

Wings may turn to the right or left (depending on which way  the propeller turns) at high power settings because of the  turning effect described earlier in the aerodynamics section.  If it does not fly straight for cruising flight, visually examine  for any asymmetric right and left features on the wing  before making any adjustments. Look for symmetry in the  twist angle. Inspect the leading edge for any discontinuities,  bumps, or an irregular leading edge stiffener. Ensure the  pockets are zippered and symmetrical on both sides. Ensure  the reflex lines are clear, straight, and routed properly. Check  the battens to ensure the right and left match (do not make  any adjustments in the battens initially because reflex may  have been added at the factory initially for tuning), and  ensure the battens match the manufacturer’s batten pattern.  Check the batten tension on both sides and the leading edge  tension to ensure it is symmetrical. If it is a used wing just  acquired, research the history of the wing to see what might  have happened which would cause it to not fly straight. For  new wings, contact the manufacturer for advice.  

If these checks do not make the wing fly straight, then  adjust the twist in the wing according to the manufacturer’s  instructions. More twist on one side decreases angle of attack,  produces less lift, and will drop the wing, which makes it turn  in the direction where more twist was added. For example,  with an unwanted left hand turn, either decrease the twist  on the left hand wing (increase angle of attack at the tip) or  increase the twist on the right hand wing (decrease the angle  of attack at the tip).  

Batten tension is one way of fixing very mild turns. Increasing  the batten tension at the tips especially decreases twist and  raises the wing. For normal mild turns, most wings have an  adjustment at the tip where you can rotate the wing tip around  the leading edge. This is the easiest and most effective wing  twist adjustment.  [Figure 5-39]  For some models, reflex at the  root can be adjusted on a side to adjust a significant turn. More  reflex on a side means wing up, similar to reducing twist in a  wing. As emphasized above, the POH for each manufacturer  must be used for adjusting twist for wing tuning.  

![](images/9724af48ccb5104520f0cb7e6aaa76fd48193c8bb79138eab5b52e742c325c2e.jpg)  
Figure 5-39.   Left hand wing tip twist adjustment shown without  sail.  

Adjusting the tension on the leading edge is another method  of adjusting the wing twist. However, different wings will  react differently when tension is adjusted, so the POH must  be followed for a particular wing. Some manufacturers do  not suggest adjusting sail tension to adjust twist, but require  equal tension with other adjustments to remedy an unwanted  turn. For those wings utilizing asymmetrical sail tension to  adjust twist, the following information is provided. Adjusting  sail tension is most effective on slower wings with lots of  twist. Adjusting sail tension affects some high performance  wings differently, making it necessary to consult the POH.  However, on most wings, increasing sail tension at the tip  increases leading edge flex, resulting in more twist.  

# Tuning the Wing To Fly Slower or Faster  

Most wings allow the hang point attachment to move forward  to increase trim speed and back to decrease trim speed.  If there is a situation where the hang point is at the most  forward position and the wing trims below the manufacturer  recommended speed, or the trim speed is within 10 miles  per hour (mph) of the stall speed, an alternate method for  increasing the trim speed is needed. For this situation, the  twist must be reduced symmetrically to increase the angle  of attack on the tips so they provide more lift and lower the  nose for proper trim.  

This can be done by pulling back more on the crosstube  tensioning cables which reduces the twist in the wing.  However, this procedure reduces the stability of the wing  and decreases the handling ability of the wing because it is  stiffer. This is a common adjustment for hang gliding wings  for inflight trim, however this adjustment should only be  made on WSC wings as specified in the POH for a specific  wing.  

Raising and lowering the reflex lines affects airfoil reflex  and also changes the trim speed of the wing. Lower reflex  lines speed the wing up and make it less stable, raising the  reflex lines slows the wing and make it more stable. Some  manufactures have this as an adjustable setting which can be  varied during flight, other manufactures have this adjustment  where it can be made on the ground. Other manufactures  do not recommend this adjustment because it can lower the  certified stability of the wing.  

# Preﬂ  ight Inspection  

Each aircraft must have a routine preﬂ  ight inspection before  ﬂ  ight. Use a written checklist during preﬂ  ight and ground  operations to maintain an established procedure.  [Figure 5-40] A written checklist is required so nothing is forgotten. Ground  checklists include preﬂ  ight preparation, preﬂ  ight inspection,  occupant preﬂ  ight brief, ﬂ  ight deck management, startup, taxi,  before takeoff, and aircraft shutdown. Be smart and follow the  regulations—use a written checklist. All checklists should be  secured so they do not ﬂ  y out of the ﬂ  ight deck in ﬂ  ight and

hit the propeller. Securing with zippered pockets and having  lanyards for the checklists is recommended. Manufacturers  of Special Light-Sport Aircraft (S-LSA) have checklists that  come with the aircraft. Pilots with an experimental aircraft  may need to develop their own.  

# Certiﬁ  cates and Documents  

The ﬁ  rst step of preﬂ  ight inspection is to ensure the aircraft  is legally airworthy which is determined in part, by the  following certiﬁ  cates and documents:  

•  A irworthiness certiﬁ  cate •  R egistration certiﬁ  cate •  O perating limitations, which may be in the form of  an FAA-approved AFM/POH, placards, instrument  markings, or any combination thereof •   W eight and balance  

ARROW is the acronym commonly used to remember these  items. The PIC is responsible for making sure the proper  documentation is on board the aircraft when operated.  [Figure 5-41]  

![](images/e718fbab3f02ad408b9695a205f6811468e74aa492e5981511953f1b07461f27.jpg)  
Figure 5-41.   Registration and airworthiness certificates are required  to be in plain view.  

Aircraft logbooks are not required to be on board when it  is operated. However, inspect the aircraft logbooks prior  to ﬂ  ight to conﬁ  rm the WSC aircraft has had all required  inspections. The owner/operator must keep maintenance  records for the airframe and powerplant. At a minimum,  there must be an annual condition inspection within the  preceding 12 calendar months. In addition, the WSC  aircraft may also need a 100-hour inspection in accordance  with 14 CFR part 91 if it is used for hire (e.g., for training  operations).  [Figure 5-42]  If a transponder system is used,  the transponder must be inspected within each preceding 24  calendar months.  

# WSC LSA Maintenance Requirements

\*\*\* Maintenance is a common term, but it is not used here because the  FAA uses the word “maintenance” to refer to a specific level of service  required to be performed by properly trained mechanics.  

Figure 5-42.   Maintenance requirements for WSC LSA.  

The pilot must have in his or her possession a Sport pilot  certiﬁ  cate for the aircraft being ﬂ  own, medical eligibility,  and a government issued photo identiﬁ  cation. For a Sport  Pilot Certiﬁ  cate, medical eligibility can be a valid United  States driver’s license, which also serves as government  issued photo identiﬁ  cation.  

To ﬂ  y the aircraft with Private Pilot privileges, the pilot  needs a valid FAA minimum third class medical certiﬁ  cate  accompanied by a government issued photo identiﬁ  cation  and Private Pilot certiﬁ  cate for WSC aircraft. See Chapter 1,  Introduction to Weight-Shift Control, for details on speciﬁ  c  pilot certiﬁ  cates and privileges.  

# Routine Preﬂ  ight Inspection  

The accomplishment of a safe ﬂ  ight begins with a careful  and systematic routine preﬂ  ight inspection to determine if  the aircraft is in a condition for safe ﬂ  ight. The preﬂ  ight  inspection should be performed in accordance with a printed  checklist provided by the manufacturer for the speciﬁ  c model  of the aircraft. However, the following general areas are  applicable to all WSC aircraft.  

The preﬂ  ight inspection begins as soon as a pilot approaches  the aircraft. Since the WSC aircraft can be transported by  trailer, ﬁ  rst and foremost, look for any damage that may have  occurred during takedown, loading, transit, unloading, and  setup. Make note of the general appearance of the aircraft,  looking for obvious discrepancies such as tires with low air  pressure, structural distortion, wear points, and dripping fuel  or oil leaks. All tie-downs, control locks, and chocks should  be removed during the unloading process.  

The pilot must be thoroughly familiar with the locations and  functions of the aircraft systems, switches, and controls. Use  the preﬂ  ight inspection as an orientation when operating a  particular model for the ﬁ  rst time.  

The actual walk-around routine preﬂ  ight inspection has been  used for years from the smallest general aviation airplane  to the largest commercial jet. The walk-around is thorough  and systematic, and should be done the same way each  time an aircraft is ﬂ  own. In addition to seeing the aircraft  up close, it requires taking the appropriate action whenever  a discrepancy is discovered. A WSC aircraft walk-around  covers four main tasks:  

1.  Wing inspection 2.  Carriage inspection 3.  Powerplant inspection 4.  Equipment check  

Throughout the inspection, check for proper operation of  systems, secure nuts/bolts/attachments/hardware, look for  any signs of deterioration or deformation of any components/ systems, such as dents, signs of excessive wear, bending,  tears, or misalignment of any components and/or cracks.  

Each WSC aircraft should have a speciﬁ  c routine preﬂ  ight  inspection checklist, but the following can be used as an  example and guideline.  

# Wing Inspection  

Start with the nose. Inspect the nose plates and the attachment  to the leading edges and keel. Ensure the nose plates are not  cracked and the bolts are fastened securely. Check the wire  attachments, top and bottom.  

Inspect the control frame, down tubes and control bar for  dents and ensure they are straight. Inspect the control frame  attachment to the keel. Inspect the control bar to down tube  brackets and bolts.  [Figure 5-43]  Inspect fore and aft ﬂ  ying  wire condition, attachment to the keel, and the lower control  bar corner brackets.  

![](images/7db5cfb82a2be991f62defdd3bd1fa7b89eb743e938a4b0924c0ffce4d8ef9e8.jpg)  
Figure 5-43.   Inspecting the control frame brackets and flying wire  attachments.  

Inspect the left side ﬂ  ying wire attachment to the control  bar bracket and condition of the ﬂ  ying wire up to the wing  attachment. Examine the ﬂ  ying wire attachment to the leading  edge and crossbar, as well as all hardware at this crossbar and  leading edge junction.  [Figure 5-44]  Inspect the condition of  the crossbar and the leading edge from the nose to the tip. Any  discrepancies or tears in the leading edge fabric must lead to  more detailed investigation of the leading edge spar itself.  

Inspect the tip area, including the washout strut and general  condition of the tip. If it is a double surface wing, look inside  the tip and examine the inside of the wing and its components.  [Figure 5-45]  

From the tip, inspect the surface condition of the fabric.  Generally, if the fabric has not been exposed to sunlight for  long periods and stored properly, the wing fabric should stay  in good shape.  

![](images/d1f3be4903ffb9d041a381f57b5560b51e7cf9a0ca65589d52d1d183eb0506d5.jpg)

Figure 5-45.   Examining inside the tip of the wing to inspect all the  components.  

Move along the trailing edge of the wing, inspecting the  condition of the trailing edge and the tip batten attachments  back to the keel.  [Figure 5-46]  Inspect the sail material,  top and bottom, on the wing. Note that the trailing edge is  

![](images/dedd7a40c777d53c60634e4618598f250afa90fcb38b62f11f98e7dea0e8b153.jpg)

vulnerable to rocks ﬂ  ying up from the wheels and hitting the  propeller. Therefore, it is especially important to inspect the  trailing edge in detail before each ﬂ  ight.  

At the aft keel area in the middle of wing, inspect the kingpost  and all the condition of the wires from the kingpost to ensure  they are not wrapped around the trailing edge battens.  [Figure 5-47]  Inspect the wing tensioning hardware where  the crossbar tensioning cables attach to the rear of the keel. Repeat this same sequence for the right (or opposite) side of  the wing, in the reverse order. Inspect the condition of the  wing attachment to the carriage, including the backup cable.  [Figure 5-48]  

![](images/bcdc6535dba10ee5be5585b51f7154f5569228a09a0f0c5c8375220d1e228a8e.jpg)  
Figure 5-47.   Inspecting the kingpost, top wires, and crossbar  tension hardware.  

# Carriage Inspection  

Inspect the mast from the top to the bottom and the carriage  keel from the back to the front.  [Figure 5-49]  Check the front  tube attachment and top and bottom security attachments.  Check the seat security and seat attachments from the keel  to the mast.  

![](images/910d539582358899e87b29fd2a380a6d8896e24f1d96fb70a76134cfd8247642.jpg)  
Figure 5-49.   Inspecting the front keel and seat attachments to the  keel.  

Check the front nose wheel for proper play, tire inﬂ  ation,  and secure axle bolt. Test the ground steering bar and ensure  there is smooth steering range of motion. Check the front  shocks, if installed, the brakes for rust and corrosion, loose  nuts/bolts, alignment, cracks, signs of hydraulic ﬂ  uid leakage,  and hydraulic line security and abrasion, if so equipped.  [Figure 5-50]  Check the foot throttle for smooth operation  and assure the parking brake is secured.

keel, and attachment to the rear wheels. Examine the rear  tires for proper inﬂ  ation and tread plus the wheel attachment  nut for security. Check main landing gear strut, landing  gear shock absorber strut, and shock absorber operation.  [Figure 5-51]  Inspect all landing gear strut attachments to  the airframe. Inspect the other side’s rear landing gear by  repeating the above procedure in reverse. Check all cowling  for secure attachment and cracks.  [Figure 5-52]

Figure 5-52.   Checking the cowl attachment for security and  cracks.  

# Powerplant Inspection  

Inspect engine attachment to the carriage for security and  cracks. In addition to looking at the bolts and mounts,  shake the propeller, as shown in  Figure 5-53,  to provide a  secure check of the propeller, gearbox, engine, and engine  attachment to the carriage.  

# Fuel System  

•  Inspect fuel tank attachment and condition.  •  Inspect fuel vent system, and ensure the fuel supply  line is open (some WSC aircraft have fuel shut off  valves outside the fuel tank).  

![](images/9e93446a6ca7461d297b5a537c2897ffd57d0fc5c701f654e9b9e7b3669b7052.jpg)  
Figure 5-53.   Checking the security of the engine to the airframe.  

•  Inspect fuel pickup and fuel line running up to fuel  ﬁ  lter. While inspecting all fuel lines, jiggle all ﬁ  ttings  and connections to ensure they are secure.  •  Inspect fuel ﬁ  lter and continue to follow fuel line up  to fuel pump.  •  Inspect the security and condition of fuel pump.  •  Inspect fuel lines up to carburetors.  [Figure 5-54]  

![](images/a9bdf68ad8d567582b6515b5e16c183aedffa4f187ca1791f3b7a66b9be38b96.jpg)  
Figure 5-54.   Checking the security and condition of the fuel lines  and fuel filter condition.  

Induction System  

•  Inspect carburetors, including ﬂ  oat bowl attachment  and rubber bushing from carburetors into engine.  •  Inspect fuel lines from ﬂ  oat bowls to carburetor inlet.  •  Inspect air inlet ﬁ  lter to ensure it is clean and secure.  [Figure 5-55]  

![](images/2c448e7d6b3bc1f601648aeb00c657a854431f50aa45f5d01dde4160e1e8bbc9.jpg)  
Figure 5-55.   Checking the security of the air inlet filter and the  security of the carburetors to the engine.  

Ignition System  

•  Inspect ignition system wires to spark plugs.  •  Inspect spark plug caps and wires to CDI units to  ensure they are secure and fastened.  [Figure 5-56]   •  Ensure ignition switches are turned off.  

![](images/1caa2e52fc85405c94c3a7fa1944792baf097a957fd6f6bf25f9f94b8f3c10e8.jpg)  
Figure 5-56.   Checking spark plug cap security to the spark plugs.  

# Cooling Systems  

Ensure there is clear airﬂ  ow for any cooling system fan or  radiator. Ensure no insects or birds created an obstruction to  the airﬂ  ow for the engine cooling system.  

Air cooled—rotate the propeller and ensure that the cooling  fan rotates also.  

Water cooled—check the coolant level to ensure there is  cooling ﬂ  uid in the system.  

Four stroke with additional oil coolers—ensure the oil cooler  has clear airﬂ  ow and that nothing is blocking it.  

# Exhaust Systems  

Inspect exhaust attachment to engine, and EGT senders.  Slightly jiggle the exhaust system to inspect the springs  holding it together. All springs must be secure. Inspect  the condition of exhaust system for cracks and attachment  security.  [Figure 5-57]  

![](images/5932f4d53fbf2648a454f91d9ce239841b5b5022e42d7b8a43d4a70c7a25b5b0.jpg)  
Figure 5-57.   Inspecting the exhaust system by jiggling the outlet  pipe and checking the springs.  

# Propeller Gearbox  

Rotate the propeller in the proper direction only and inspect  blades for cracks or nicks. Listen and feel for smooth  operation and engine compression while rotating the  propeller. Inspect propeller attachment to the gearbox and  the gearbox attachment to the engine.  

# Throttle System  

Check all throttle controls for smooth operation and proper  travel and locking. Also check choke and/or primer system  for proper operation and travel.  

# Flight Deck Inspection  

The following should be performed for a flight deck  inspection:  

•  Check seat security and proper adjustment for pilot  and passenger.  •  Check seat belt attachment and seatbelt operation.  •  Inspect the gauges for security and readability.  •  Switch electrical master on and check gauges for  expected readings.  [Figure 5-58]   •  Check ballistic parachute handle for security and  proper location.  

# Fuel  

Overall, particular attention should be paid to the fuel quantity,  type/grade, and quality. Modern WSC two- and four-stroke  engines are designed to use auto gas with various octane ratings  as speciﬁ  ed by the manufacturer for different models. If auto  gas is stored for more than 3 weeks, octane value may fall  below the recommended rating. In this situation, it is best to  drain the gas and use fresh gas. For engines designed for auto  gas, aviation gasoline (AVGAS) 100LL can be mixed and used  

![](images/3edcfc4cd7441754766cb34a83b2eac7a7923d3bfcc115339a82e1f7916bdb48.jpg)  
Figure 5-58.   Checking the flight deck instruments for readability  and security. Turning on the main electrical power to verify proper  instrument readings.  

on a limited basis but the lead in this is not good for the engine  and additional precautions/procedures should be researched for  the particular make/model of engine for primary use.  

Always use a higher grade/octane of fuel rather than a lower  grade, or detonation will severely damage the engine in a very  short period of time. Check the aircraft operation manual and  the engine manual for the type of fuel to use.  

When attempting to fuel for maximum capacity, remember  that many fuel tanks are very sensitive to attitude. Fill the  aircraft on a level surface and check to ensure the amount  of fuel in the tanks is adequate for the planned ﬂ  ight plus 30  minutes of reserve. Check the level in the fuel tank plus the  panel-mounted gauge, if so equipped.  

To transport gasoline, clear gas cans are preferable because  the fuel is visible through the container and allows a pilot to  look at the container for fuel level.  [Figure 5-59]  

An important step in any preﬂ  ight is to check for water and  other sediment contamination. Avgas is more probable to  have water in the fuel tanks because auto gas typically has  alcohol in it to boost the octane. Alcohol absorbs water,  running it harmlessly through the system.  

When using 100LL Avgas, water tends to accumulate in  fuel tanks from condensation, particularly in partially ﬁ  lled  tanks. Because water is heavier than fuel, it tends to collect  in the low points of the fuel system. If Avgas is used, drain  any water from the low point in the system.  

# Oil  

A four-stroke engine’s oil level should be checked during  each preﬂ  ight and rechecked with each refueling. Four- stroke engines can be expected to consume a small amount  

![](images/5c501ef63b83b64da4a7a48e3fbbd29c153084f64d4d79d1022dec0baa5b3bf6.jpg)  
Figure 5-59.   Translucent fuel containers with premixed oil (right)  and auto gas only (left).  

of oil during normal operation. If consumption grows or  suddenly changes, qualiﬁ  ed maintenance personnel should  investigate.  

If the Rotax 912 oil level is low when the oil is checked,  rotate the propeller in the correct direction (counterclockwise,  facing it) to pump any oil from the engine back into the oil  tank for a proper measurement and recheck oil level before  adding oil.  [Figure 5-60]  

![](images/dcff215fe9b5991f753cdb8ada0fb2d58ccad39c68e9ec7b752f471b20f7d23d.jpg)  
Figure 5-60.   Four-stroke engine showing the oil reservoir where  the dip stick is located to check the oil.  

Check the reservoir level of two-stroke engines with oil  injection at each gas ﬁ  ll-up. It is also very important to ensure  the oil reservoir has clear air vent holes to allow continuous  ﬂ  ow of oil to lubricate the engine. Always use the same type  of oil because different types of oil harden and stop the oil  injection process, resulting in a seized engine. Additionally,  check to see if the oil injection system lines from the tank  to the carburetors are clean and secure. Some two-stroke  engines have a separate lubrication system for the inlet rotary  valve; this system should be checked for proper level and  leaks.  [Figure 5-61]  When adding fuel and oil, ensure that  the caps has been securely replaced.

# Ready Aircraft To Enter Flight Deck  

Either before or after the routine preﬂ  ight inspection, the  aircraft should be unsecured, positioned for starting, and  readied to enter the ﬂ  ight deck. A checklist provides the  basic steps.  

•  Untie aircraft, secure tie down ropes in aircraft, or coil  neatly if they stay at airport. •  Remove ground chocks and secure in aircraft.  •  Locate a suitable area to start engine that is free of dirt  and has minimal dust, preferably a paved or grassy  area away from people and objects. •  Position aircraft so prop blast is clear; verify that  brakes are on, throttle is closed, and propeller area is  cleared. •  Position into wind, if possible, for best cooling during  warm up.  

# Occupant Preﬂ  ight Brief  

A preﬂ  ight brieﬁ  ng is required to ensure the passenger is  informed on the proper use of safety equipment and exit  information. This can be done before entering the aircraft,  and must be accomplished before starting the engine.  Manufacturers of S-LSA aircraft typically have printed  briefing cards that should be used. The following is a  comprehensive checklist that can be used as a guideline for  any preﬂ  ight brieﬁ  ng:  

•  Seat belt fasten and unfasten procedures. Seat belts  must be worn for takeoff and landing (and should  always be worn during ﬂ  ight). •  What passengers can hold onto and what not to  touch. •  Positive exchange of controls using a three step  process : “You take the controls,” “I have the controls,”  “You have the controls.” •  Look for other ground and air trafﬁ  c. •  Flight deck entrance and exit procedures including  emergency exit. •  Ballistic parachute operation procedures.  •  Engine-out situation and procedures for planned ﬂ  ight  with diversions. •  Hand signals in case electric loads must be shut off  or internal aircraft communications not functioning. •  Water landings with engine-out situation, if planned  ﬂ  ight over water. •  Ensure nothing can fall out of pockets while in ﬂ  ight.  This is especially important since the propeller is in  back. •  Helmet fastening and unfastening procedure.  [Figure 5-62]  

![](images/df4e05e84a2ce23ee6ab38df62b231c80ab36e148ad3be0acaf8664fdb9ec993.jpg)  
Figure 5-62.   Pilot briefing the passenger on how to fasten and  unfasten helmet.  

•  Review the type of aircraft (special or experimental)  which is not an FAA certified standard category  aircraft.  

•  Fire extinguisher operation, if so equipped. •  All safety systems, as required. •  Use restroom before entering aircraft.  

# Flight Deck Management  

After entering the ﬂ  ight deck, the pilot should ﬁ  rst ensure that  all necessary equipment, documents, checklists, and navigation  charts appropriate for the ﬂ  ight are on board.  [Figure 5-63]  If a  portable intercom, headsets, or a hand-held global positioning  system (GPS) is used, the pilot is responsible for ensuring  that the routing of wires and cables does not interfere with  the motion or the operation of any control.  

![](images/18806c520de22267da713dfac95d9e48ac1faa516c6b300aa689519c46961bce.jpg)  
Figure 5-63.   Pilot fastens helmet and reviews checklist while in  flight deck.  

Regardless of what materials are to be used, they should  be neatly arranged and organized in a manner that makes  them readily available. The ﬂ  ight deck should be checked  for articles that might be tossed about if turbulence is  encountered, and any loose items properly secured.  

When the pilot is comfortably seated, the safety belt and  shoulder harness (if installed) should be fastened and adjusted  to a comfortably snug ﬁ  t. The safety belt must be worn at all  times the pilot is seated at the controls.  

# Checklist After Entering Flight Deck  

•  Seats adjusted for full operation of all controls. •  Seats locked into position. •  Put on seat belts (lap ﬁ  rst, then shoulder) and adjust  so all controls and systems can be fully operated. •  Check all control systems for proper operation. •  Check all systems operations. •  Demonstrate and practice flight and emergency  equipment and procedures.  

•  Demonstrate and practice what passengers can hold  onto, and what not to touch. •  Demonstrate and practice positive exchange of  controls. •  Remove safety pin for ballistic chute operation. •  Install helmet (if applicable) and headphones. •  Check intercom and radio communications systems. •  Install eye protection (safety glasses, helmet  shields).  

It is important that a pilot operates an aircraft safely on the  ground. This includes being familiar with standard hand  signals that are used universally for ground operations.  [Figure 5-64]  

# Engine Start  

The speciﬁ  c procedures for engine start vary greatly since  there are as many different methods as there are engines, fuel  systems, and starting conditions. The engine start checklist  procedures in the POH should be followed. The following  are some basic steps that apply to most aircraft:  

•  Key in, ignition on, master power on •  Check gauges for operation and fuel level. •  Fuel pump on (or pump fuel bulb to ﬁ  ll carburetor  bowls) •  System switches on. (Some WSC have speciﬁ  c system  switches turned on after the engine is started because  engine starting may create lower voltage possibly  damaging instruments or systems. If in doubt, start  engine and than turn on instruments and systems not  needed for starting.)  •  Both ignition systems switches on •  Choke/enrichener on (or pump primer as  appropriate) •  Throttle closed •  Brakes on •  Ensure propeller area is cleared, loudly announce  to propeller area “Clear prop,” and wait for any  response. •  Start engine through pull cord start or electric start  (do not try to hand prop under any circumstances)  •  Ensure the aircraft does not move, keeping hands on  ignition switches for quick shutdown, if necessary. •  Adjust throttle, choke or enrichener to keep engine  running smoothly.  

![](images/d7242cb2a3809ab4fe9bf8ba9aa3d89ab5834f43e1629293d0ad9c349fba21b4.jpg)  
Figure 5-64.   Hand signals for ground operations.  

•  Turn on electric instruments if applicable. •  Check gauges for proper ranges (oil pressure,  revolutions per minute (rpm), charging voltage, engine  temperatures within ranges, etc.) •  Continue to monitor area and shut down engine if any  person or animal approaches.  

A relatively low rpm setting is recommended immediately  following engine start. This is typically a slight increase in  the throttle to keep the engine running smoothly. It is not  recommended to allow the rpm to race immediately after a  start with a cold engine, as there is insufﬁ  cient lubrication  until the oil pressure rises on four-stroke engines, and unequal  heating on two-stroke engines. In freezing temperatures,  the engine is also exposed to potential mechanical distress  until it warms and normal internal operating clearances are  reached.  

On four-stroke engines, as soon as the engine is started,  the oil pressure should be checked. If it does not rise to  the manufacturer’s speciﬁ  ed value, the engine may not  be receiving proper lubrication and should be shut down  immediately to prevent serious damage.  

# Taxiing  

Since an aircraft is moved under its own power between  the startup area and the runway, the pilot must thoroughly  understand and be proﬁ  cient in taxi procedures. When the  brakes are ﬁ  rst released and the aircraft starts to roll, the  brakes should be tested immediately for proper operation.  Applying power to start the WSC aircraft moving forward  slowly, then retarding the throttle and simultaneously  applying pressure smoothly on the brake may be needed to  accomplish this. If braking action is unsatisfactory, the engine  should be shut down immediately.  

When yellow taxiway centerline stripes are provided, they  should be followed unless it becomes necessary to deviate  to clear aircraft or obstructions.  [Figure 5-65]

Figure 5-65.   Taxiing on the yellow airport taxi line.  

An awareness of other aircraft that are taking off, landing, or  taxiing, and consideration for the right-of-way of others is  essential to safety. When taxiing, the pilot’s eyes should be  looking outside the aircraft, to the sides, as well as the front.  The pilot must be aware of the entire area around the aircraft  to ensure that it clears all obstructions, people, animals, and  other aircraft. If at any time there is doubt about the clearance  from an object, the pilot should stop the aircraft and check  the clearance. The WSC aircraft does have the advantage of  the wing tip capability of being raised and lowered to clear  objects.  

It is difﬁ  cult to set any rule for a single, safe taxiing speed.  What is reasonable and prudent under some conditions may  be hazardous under others. The primary requirements for safe  taxiing are positive control, the ability to recognize potential  hazards in time to avoid them, and the ability to stop or turn  where and when desired without undue reliance on the brakes.  Pilots should proceed at a cautious speed on congested or  busy ramps. Normally, the speed should be at the rate at  which movement of the aircraft is dependent on the throttle.  That is, the speed should be low enough that when the throttle  is closed, the aircraft can be stopped promptly.  

A GPS provides this speed since the airspeed indicator is not  effective at these lower speeds. A rule of thumb is  $5\,\mathrm{mph}$  , brisk  walking speed, or  $10\,\mathrm{mph}$   for long unobstructed areas. When  taxiing, it is best to slow down before attempting a turn.  

WSC aircraft taxi with the wing typically held in a neutral  position, but stronger winds may require positioning of the  wing so it cannot be lifted. Position controls properly for  wind conditions:  

•  Strong tailwind—pitch control normal or slight nose  up with wings level. •  Strong headwind—pitch control nose down with  wings level. •  Strong quartering tail wind—nose normal with upwind  wing slightly down so wind cannot catch it, but not to  low to cause excess stress on carriage mast. •  Strong quartering head wind—nose down with upwind  wing slightly down so wind cannot catch it, but not  low enough to cause excess stress on carriage mast.  

# Checklist for Taxi  

Plan taxi path to runway to avoid paths that would put the  aircraft behind any propeller or jet blast. Observe other  aircraft closely which could start up and taxi in front, if  practical.  

•  Turn on strobe light (if applicable). •  Release brake.  •  When ﬁ  rst rolling, immediately check brakes, steering,  and shut down if either is not functioning properly. •  Observe proper right of way while taxiing. -  Taxiing aircraft yield to landing aircraft, so  landing craft have right of way over taxiing  aircraft.  

-  Two aircraft approaching head on will turn right  (similar to what is done in a car). -  Two aircraft traveling in same direction, the  forward aircraft has right of way because its pilot  can not normally see the aircraft in back. -  With two airplanes converging, the pilot who sees  an aircraft on the right must avoid that aircraft.  The aircraft on the right has the right of way. Runway incursions—observe all taxiway and runway  markings.  

Runway incursions are a signiﬁ  cant risk and must be avoided.  This is a most important concept. Taxi slowly and observe  the basic airport markings/signs. Clearance to proceed must  be obtained prior to taxiing across any runway or entering a  runway to takeoff. There could be large aircraft, which may  not be able to respond to WSC aircraft quick movements. An  important runway marker is the “Hold Short Line.” Always  stop before reaching this line and get clearance before  crossing it.  [Figure 5-66]  

•  At a towered airport, this is clearance from the tower.  Always read back tower instructions clearance when  received from tower before proceeding. •  At a nontowered airport, the clearance procedure is  to listen to and monitor all air trafﬁ  c on the airport  radio frequency. Observe all air trafﬁ  c taxiing and in  the pattern. After listening on the radio and observing  all possible trafﬁ  c, announce position and intentions  before crossing runway or entering runway. If crossing  runway, announce once you have taxied across that  you are clear of runway.

# Before Takeoff Check  

The before takeoff check is the systematic procedure for  making a check of the engine, controls, systems, instruments,  and avionics prior to ﬂ  ight. Normally, it is performed after  taxiing to a position near the takeoff end of the runway.  Taxiing to that position usually allows sufficient time  for the engine to warm up to at least minimum operating  temperatures. This ensures adequate lubrication and internal  engine clearances before being operated at high power  settings. Many engines require that the oil temperature or  engine temperature reach a minimum value, as stated in the  AFM/POH, before high power is applied.  

Some WSC aircraft are ram air cooled, where the cooling  air must be rammed into the cooling radiator during ﬂ  ight.  On the ground, however, little or no air is forced through  the radiator. Prolonged ground operations may cause engine  overheating. Some designs place the cooling radiators near  the propeller so the propeller produces reasonable airﬂ  ow  to cool the engine.  

Air cooled two-stroke engine aircraft may have an integral  engine driven cooling fan and can idle indeﬁ  nitely without  overheating. Monitoring engine temperature to be within  limits is important for aircraft operations on the ground.  

After taxiing to the runway entrance runup area and before  beginning the pretakeoff check, the aircraft should be  positioned clear of other aircraft. When you taxi out to the  run up area, position your self where other aircraft can easily  taxi to a suitable run up area. There should not be anything  behind the aircraft that might be damaged by the prop  blast. To minimize overheating during engine run-up, it is  recommended that the aircraft be headed as nearly as possible  into the wind. After an aircraft is properly positioned for the  run-up, the nose wheel should be pointed straight.  

During the engine run-up, the surface under the WSC aircraft  should be ﬁ  rm (a smooth, paved, or turf surface, if possible)  and free of debris. Otherwise, the propeller may pick up  pebbles, dirt, or other loose objects and hurl them backward  or into the sail.  [Figure 5-67]  

While performing the engine run-up, the pilot must divide  attention inside to look at the instruments and outside the  aircraft to look for other trafﬁ  c. If the parking brake slips,  or if application of the brakes is inadequate for the amount  of power applied, the aircraft could move forward unnoticed  if attention is ﬁ  xed only inside the aircraft.  

Each aircraft has different features and equipment, and the  before takeoff checklist provided by the WSC manufacturer  

![](images/57b6203c4a13738284721522b012b776b9376c91793a24a68724d86015beb776.jpg)  
Figure 5-67.   Positioned in the aircraft run up area before takeoff,  the WSC is ready to perform the pretakeoff checklist.  

should be used to perform the run-up. Here is a general  checklist.  

•  Verify the strobe light is on (if applicable). •  Trim is set to proper speed for takeoff. •  Brakes are set. •  Ignition check—always divide attention into and out  of the ﬂ  ight deck in case the brakes can not hold the  aircraft still at the higher power settings. (Some ignition  checks are done at idle; see POH for engine speciﬁ  cs.)  If the brakes start to slip and the aircraft starts moving,  decrease power immediately and reevaluate how to run  up and keep the aircraft stationary during run up. Run up  engine to consistent rpm higher than idle. Switch from  both ignition systems to one and watch for a slight drop  in rpm. Do the same for the other ignition system. •  Verify engine temperatures (EGT, CHT, oil and/or water)  and oil pressure are within the acceptable ranges.  

At towered airports, obtain clearance from tower when ready  for takeoff. At nontowered airports, when all air trafﬁ  c is  clear from observations and radio communications and while  holding short before the runway boundary (hold short) line,  announce the aircraft is entering the runway. This is a pilot’s  clearance at a self-announce airport to enter the runway. At  all airports, do a visual veriﬁ  cation that there are no aircraft  landing before entering the runway.  

# After Landing  

During the after-landing roll, the WSC aircraft should be  gradually slowed to normal taxi speed before turning off  the landing runway. Any signiﬁ  cant degree of turn at faster  speeds could result in the WSC aircraft tipping over and  subsequent damage.  [Figure 5-68]  

![](images/5fa131b7493101fc2e90c73845ce1d36fbbfd5f1aa70abec7aa3b0687b44c0b3.jpg)  
Figure 5-68.   After landing, the pilot slows to the appropriate taxi  speed before following the yellow taxi lines to exit the runway.  

To give full attention to controlling the WSC aircraft during  the landing roll, the after-landing check should be performed  only after the aircraft is brought to a complete stop clear of  the active runway.  

# Postﬂ  ight, Parking, and Securing  

A ﬂ  ight is never complete until the engine is shut down and  the WSC aircraft is secured. A pilot should consider this an  essential part of any ﬂ  ight. Unless parking in a designated,  supervised area, the pilot should select a location which  prevents propeller or jet blast of other airplanes from striking  the WSC aircraft.  

The pilot should always use the procedures in the  manufacturer’s checklist for shutting down the engine and  securing the airplane. Some of the important items include:  

•  Set the parking brakes on. •  Set throttle to idle and let engine cool down to  manufactures speciﬁ  cations. •  Turn ignition switch off. •  Turn electrical units and radios off. •  Turn master electrical switch to off.  

After engine shutdown and exiting the aircraft, the pilot  should accomplish a postﬂ  ight inspection. When the ﬂ  ight  is complete, the aircraft should be hangared or tied down  appropriately for the situation.  

There are a number of ways to park and secure the WSC aircraft  depending on the situation. With normal aircraft tie downs,  little to no wind, and a short time frame for unsupervised  parking, the WSC aircraft can be secured by tying both leading  edge cross bar junctions to the typical airport wing ties. The  control bar is secured to the front tube with a bungee chord  to stabilize the nose or the control bar can be pulled back and  attached to the seat rail to keep the nose down in case of a  possible headwind.  [Figure 5-69]  

![](images/2f1265dab0542bbcd47591ee8583163d82bf75e8fb3a42e1ab68e04c0e7b63a9.jpg)  
Figure 5-69.   Typical tie down for light wind. Left hand WSC control  bar pulled back to lower nose for possible headwind, right hand  control bar fastened to front tube.  

If higher winds are present, the WSC aircraft can be positioned  so the wind is blowing from the side and the wing tip is  lowered on the windward side so the wind is pushing down  on the wing. This can be used to exit the aircraft and tie the  wing down in higher winds.  [Figures 5-70  through  5-72]

Figure 5-72.   Group of WSC aircraft tied down with wing tips lowered  into prevailing wind.  

For overnight or higher wind tie down, the complete wing  can be lowered to the ground with a four point tie down.  Each wing at the crossbar/leading edge junction plus the  nose and rear of the keel can be tied down for greater  resistance to wind. For humid or dusty areas, a cover is  recommended for the carriage to cover the engine and ﬂ  ight  deck.  [Figure 5-73]  

![](images/62ba6aa3c99a6781ebf15f732b73f6eba4a442b10a409a28435a6f926701891f.jpg)

•   EnVironment: where to fly, weather conditions,  forecast for departure and destination airﬁ  elds, route  of ﬂ  ight, and speciﬁ  c airport patterns/runway lengths.  Pilot capabilities must be compared to the weather  limitations for the decision of whether to go to the  airﬁ  eld.

 •   External pressures: schedules, available alternatives,  purpose of ﬂ  ight.  

# Preﬂ  ight procedures include:  

•  Set up of the wing and mounting the wing on the  carriage (if trailered or taken down).

 •  Tuning the wing to ﬂ  y straight and at the proper trim  speed.

 •  Preﬂ  ight inspection with written checklist of wing,  carriage, powerplant, systems, and ﬂ  ight deck.

 •  Readying aircraft to enter by proper positioning and  occupant preﬂ  ight brief.

 •  Engine start, taxi, and performing before takeoff  check.  

# Postﬂ  ight procedures include:  

•  Taxi off runway to appropriate location.

 •  Park, exit, post flight and documenting any  discrepancies.

 •  Hangar, secure or take down.  

The best way to secure the WSC aircraft for overnight is to  put it in a hangar. If it must be stored outside, remove the  wing and fold it up so there is no chance of the wing being  damaged in an unforeseen gust front.  

# Chapter Summary  

Preﬂ  ight preparations should include the overall evaluation  of the:  

•   Pilot: experience, sleep, food and water, drugs or  medications, stress, illness and overall aeromedical  factors, as discussed in Chapter 1, Introduction to  Weight-Shift Control. •   Aircraft: proper transport, fuel, weight (does not  exceed maximum), ARROW, takeoff and landing  requirements, equipment.  

# Chapter 6 Flight Manuevers  

# Introduction  

Flying a weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft is not like  driving an automobile on the highway. It is also different  from operating the controls of an airplane. A WSC pilot  holds the control bar, which is a structural component  of the wing, in his or her hands. This wing is attached to  the carriage and freely rotates laterally and longitudinally  about the hang point. Therefore, the “feel” of the WSC is  completely different from other aircraft because there are no  movable control surfaces actuated through push/pull rods  or cables connected to a separate control actuator, such as  a stick or yoke.  

The pilot feels forces on the wing through the control bar,  which is part of the wing structure with no mechanical  advantage. Simply, the feel of the WSC is different from other  aircraft but the basic ﬂ  ight maneuvers are similar.  

![](images/df9f0c879d92ae68a39fb715156ce77e74ff10a7f125c4de525f2635b0418bf7.jpg)  
Figure 6-1.   Roll diagram.  

Practicing the basics with precision and understanding the  effects on the pilot and the aircraft develop a “feel” for the  aircraft in ﬂ  ight so the pilot can concentrate on the ﬂ  ying  mission at hand and not on the mechanical movements. The  ability to perform any assigned maneuver is only a matter of  obtaining a clear visual and mental conception of it so that  perfect performance is a habit without conscious effort.  

Begin with the ﬂ  ight basics to build a foundation for precision  ﬂ  ying. Takeoffs/landings and emergency maneuvers are  covered in later chapters. All ﬂ  ying tasks are based on the  four fundamental ﬂ  ight maneuvers:  

•  Straight-and-level ﬂ  ight •  Turns •  Climbs  •  Descents  

Controlled ﬂ  ight consists of either one or a combination of  these basic maneuvers.  

# Effects and the Use of the Controls  

In using the ﬂ  ight controls, the results should be looked at in  relation to the pilot. The pilot should always be considered  the center of movement of the aircraft or the reference point  from which the movements are judged and described. The  important concept and a foundation for all ﬂ  ight maneuvers  is not to think of the controls in terms of “up” or “down” in  respect to the Earth. This is only a relative state to the pilot.  Controls need to be thought of in relation to the pilot, so that  the control use can be for any ﬂ  ight attitude whether climbing,  diving, banking, or a combination of these.  

Sideways pressure applied by moving the control bar to the  left lowers the right wing in relation to the pilot; moving  the control bar to the right lowers the left wing in relation  to the pilot. This is roll control as discussed in Chapter 2,  Aerodynamics.  [Figure 6-1]  

Pushing and forward pressure applied to the control bar  results in the WSC aircraft’s nose rising in relation to the pilot  slowing down the WSC, while pulling in or back pressure  results in the nose lowering in relation to the pilot increasing  speed of the WSC. At the same trim speed, increasing the  throttle results in the nose remaining at the same level in  relation to the pilot but raising pitch with increased throttle  and lowering pitch with decreased throttle in relation to the  Earth’s horizon. Both control bar and throttle effect pitch  in relation to the earth’s horizon. This is pitch control, as  discussed in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics.  [Figure 6-2]

Figure 6-2.   Control bar effect on pitch and airspeed.  

# Feel of the Aircraft  

All WSC aircraft controls have a natural “live pressure”  while in ﬂ  ight and will remain in a neutral position of their  own accord if the aircraft is trimmed properly. The pilot  should think of exerting a force on the controls against this  live pressure or resistance. It is the duration and amount of  force exerted on the control bar that affects the controls and  maneuvers the WSC aircraft.  

The actual amount of the control input is of little importance;  but it is important that the pilot maneuver the aircraft by  applying sufﬁ  cient control pressure to obtain a desired result,  regardless of how far the control bar is actually moved. The  controls should be held lightly, not grabbed and squeezed. A  common error for beginning pilots is a tendency to “tightly  grip the bar.” This tendency should be avoided as it prevents  the development of “feel,” which is an important part of  aircraft control.  [Figure 6-3]  

![](images/f2fa2f29d4817069e309a190b20280d241734441c086f826d3a11d910546e71f.jpg)  
Figure 6-3.   Hold the control bar with a light touch to feel every  movement in the wing.  

However, for WSC aircraft, the controls do need to be gripped  during moderate and severe turbulence to make sure the wing  does not get ripped out of the pilot’s hands. This is why ﬂ  ying  a WSC aircraft in turbulence requires strength and endurance.  It can be fatiguing if the pilot is not used to or in shape for  this type of ﬂ  ying. The initial ﬂ  ight training should be done  in calm conditions so the student can use a soft touch on the  controls to develop the feel for the WSC aircraft.  

The ability to sense a ﬂ  ight condition is often called “feel  of the aircraft,” but senses in addition to “feel” are also  involved. Sounds inherent to ﬂ  ight are an important sense  in developing “feel.” The air that rushes past an open ﬂ  ight  deck can be felt and heard easily within the tolerances of the  Practical Test Standards (PTS) of  $\pm\,10$   knots. When the level  of sound increases, it indicates that airspeed is increasing. In  addition to the sound of the air, air rushing past is also felt  unless an effective wind screen is placed in front of the pilot  blocking the wind.  [Figure 6-4]  

![](images/1ce0627cda2b65324cfb6079306440fa1697bab6fbb56d442cbc7135b5e7cd12.jpg)  
Figure 6-4.   Wind shield blocks the wind from hitting the pilot.  

The powerplant emits distinctive sound patterns in different  conditions of ﬂ  ight. The sound of the engine in cruise ﬂ  ight  sounds different from the sound in a glide or a climb. Overall,  there are three sources of actual “feel” that are very important  to the pilot.  

1.  The ﬁ  rst source is the pilot’s own body as it responds  to forces of acceleration. The “G” loads, as discussed  in Chapter 2, imposed on the airframe are also felt by  the pilot. Centripetal acceleration forces the pilot down  into the seat or raises the pilot against the seat belt.  Radial accelerations, although minor for WSC aircraft,  are caused by minor slips or skids in uncoordinated  ﬂ  ight and shift the pilot from side to side in the seat.  These forces are all perceptible and useful to the pilot.  Flight time plus the pilot’s desire to feel the aircraft  provides the pilot an excellent “feel” for the aircraft  and the ability to detect even the smallest change in  ﬂ  ight. A goal for any pilot should be to constantly  develop a better feel for their aircraft.  

2.  The response of the controls to the pilot’s touch is  another element of “feel,” and is one that provides  direct information concerning airspeed.  

3.  Another type of “feel” comes to the pilot through the  airframe. It consists mainly of vibration. An example  is the aerodynamic buffeting and shaking that precedes  a stall. Different airspeeds and power settings can also  provide a subtle feel in aircraft vibrations.  

Kinesthesia, or the sensing of changes in direction or speed  of motion, is one of the most important senses a pilot can  develop. When properly developed, kinesthesia can warn the  pilot of changes in speed and/or the beginning of a settling  or mushing of the aircraft.  

The senses that contribute to “feel” of the aircraft are inherent  in every person. However, “feel” must be developed. It is a  well established fact that the pilot who develops a “feel” for  the aircraft early in ﬂ  ight training has little difﬁ  culty with  advanced ﬂ  ight maneuvers.  

# Attitude Flying  

Flying by attitude means visually establishing the aircraft’s  attitude with reference to the natural horizon. Attitude  is the angular difference measured between an aircraft’s  axis and the Earth’s horizon. As discussed in Chapter 2,  Aerodynamics, pitch attitude is the angle formed by the  longitudinal axis, and bank attitude is the angle formed by the  lateral axis. Rotation about the aircraft’s vertical axis (yaw)  is termed an attitude relative to the aircraft’s ﬂ  ightpath, but  not relative to the natural horizon.  

In attitude ﬂ  ying, aircraft control is composed of three  components:  

1.  Bank control—control of the aircraft about the  longitudinal axis to attain a desired bank angle in  relation to the natural horizon. This can be easily seen  in a WSC aircraft by looking at the angle the front tube  makes with the horizon.  [Figure 6-5]   2.  Pitch control—control of the aircraft about the lateral  axis to raise and lower the nose in relation to the  natural horizon.  3.  Power control—used when the ﬂ  ight situation indicates  a need for a change in thrust, which at a constant  speed raises and lowers the nose in relationship to the  horizon similar to pitch control.  

# Straight-and-Level Flying  

Flying straight and level is the most important flight  maneuver to master. It is impossible to emphasize too  

![](images/86eb0e38af18192be2ff3336b850c42d11baeb2e47f73226b5f3bc69484947e6.jpg)  
Figure 6-5.   Pilot’s view of  $45^{\circ}$   bank angle can be measured with the front tube or the control bar’s angle with the horizon.  

strongly the necessity for forming correct habits in ﬂ  ying  straight and level. All ﬂ  ight is in essence a deviation from  this fundamental ﬂ  ight maneuver. It is not uncommon to  ﬁ  nd a pilot whose basic ﬂ  ying ability consistently falls just  short of minimum expected standards, and upon analyzing  the reasons for the shortcomings discover that the cause is  the inability to ﬂ  y straight and level properly.  

In learning to control the aircraft in level ﬂ  ight, it is important  that the control forces be exerted just enough to produce the  desired result. Some wings are more responsive than others.  The student should learn to associate the apparent movement  of the control bar with the response in pitch and roll. In this  way, the student can develop the ability to regulate the change  desired in the aircraft’s attitude by the amount and direction  of forces applied to the controls without the necessity of  referring to outside references for each minor correction.  

Straight-and-level flight is flight in which a constant  heading and altitude are maintained. It is accomplished by  making immediate and measured corrections for deviations  in direction and altitude from unintentional slight turns,  descents, and climbs. Level ﬂ  ight is a matter of consciously  ﬁ  xing the relationship of the position of something on the  aircraft, used as a reference point with a point on the horizon.  In establishing the reference point on the aircraft, place the  aircraft in the desired position and select a reference point.  A typical reference point on the WSC aircraft is a point on  the front tube.  

The WSC aircraft reference point depends on where the  pilot is sitting, the pilot’s height (whether short or tall), and  the pilot’s manner of sitting. It is, therefore, important when  establishing this relationship, the pilot sit in a normal manner;  otherwise the points will not be the same when the normal  position is resumed.  [Figures 6-6  and  6-7]  

Straight-and-level ﬂ  ight should ﬁ  rst be practiced in calm air  where the control movements determine the actual movement  through the air and air movement has minimal effect on the  aircraft’s altitude and direction.  

A trim speed needs to be set if the WSC aircraft has an inﬂ  ight  trim system or the trim speed set on the ground is used. The  throttle is adjusted so the aircraft is ﬂ  ying level, not climbing  or descending. This can be determined by looking at the  altimeter or the vertical speed indicator (if so equipped). The  throttle setting is the control for maintaining level ﬂ  ight for a  speciﬁ  c weight, loading, trim speed, and density altitude.  

Level ﬂ  ight is maintained by selecting some portion of the  aircraft’s nose as a reference point, and then keeping that  point in a ﬁ  xed position relative to the horizon. Using the  principles of attitude ﬂ  ying, that position should be cross- checked occasionally against the altimeter to determine  whether or not the throttle setting and pitch attitude are  correct. If altitude is being gained or lost, the pitch attitude  should be readjusted with the throttle in relation to the  horizon. Then, recheck the altimeter to determine if altitude  is being maintained and adjust the throttle accordingly. The  throttle setting for this condition should be noted and all  future changes in weight, trim speed, and density altitude  referenced to this known throttle setting.  

After level ﬂ  ight is mastered in calm air, it can be practiced  in air that is moving, minor turbulence or “active air.” The  throttle settings for similar weight, trim, and density altitude  are the same, but more pilot input is required to maintain a  constant altitude. The throttle is used to maintain a selected  distance above the reference point for local air movement, but  the pitch pressure (nose up or nose down) is used to control  this attitude for shorter duration air disturbances.  

Typically, updrafts or thermals raise the nose of the aircraft  and downdrafts at the edge of thermals lower the nose of the  aircraft. For minor updrafts the nose is lowered by pitch control  input by the pilot slightly increasing the speed of the aircraft  to keep the pitch at a constant level. In moderate to severe  updrafts, the throttle can be reduced to assist in maintaining  a reasonably constant pitch angle with the horizon.  

Similarly for minor downdrafts that lower the nose, the nose  is raised by pitch control input by the pilot slightly decreasing  the speed of the aircraft to keep the pitch at a constant level.  An additional caution for raising the nose and decreasing the  speed is that raising the nose too high could stall the aircraft.  Therefore, caution must be exercised in moderate downdrafts  not to reduce the speed too much to approach a stall speed/ critical angle of attack. Similar to reducing the throttle in  updrafts to reduce pitch angle, increasing the throttle typically  increases the pitch angle.  [Figure 6-8]  

WSC aircraft can use the front tube as a reference to align  perpendicular with the horizon and the wings leveled. It  should be noted that any time the wings are banked even  slightly, the aircraft will turn.  

The front tube can be used as an indicator to determine turn  rate. If the bar is moving side to side to any established  reference point, the aircraft is banked and should be corrected  to eliminate any turn. The objective of straight-and-level  ﬂ  ight is to detect small deviations from level ﬂ  ight as soon  as they occur, necessitating only small corrections.  

Straight-and-level ﬂ  ight requires almost no application of  control pressures if the aircraft is properly trimmed and the

air is smooth. For that reason, pilots must not form the habit  of constant, unnecessary control movement. Pilots should  learn to recognize when corrections are necessary, and then  make a measured response easily and naturally.  

Common errors in the performance of straight-and-level  ﬂ  ight are:  

•  Attempting to use improper reference points on the  aircraft to establish attitude.  •  Forgetting the location of selected reference points.  •  Too tight a grip on the ﬂ  ight controls resulting in  overcontrol and lack of “feel.”  •  Improper scanning and/or devoting insufﬁ  cient time  to outside visual reference (head in the ﬂ  ight deck).  •  Fixation on the nose (pitch attitude) reference point  only.  •  Unnecessary or inappropriate control inputs.  •  Failure to make timely and measured control inputs  when deviations from straight-and-level ﬂ  ight are  detected.  •  Inadequate attention to sensory inputs in developing  feel for the aircraft.  

Most WSC aircraft have a ground adjustable pitch/speed  trim system that adjusts the carriage hang point on the wing  keel that is set for the desired speed. Some WSC aircraft  have additional pitch control systems that can adjust the  trim speed in ﬂ  ight as described in Chapter 3, Components  and Systems.  

There is no yaw trim but the roll trim is usually adjusted on  the ground for a wing that has a turn in it. Roll trim is usually  adjusted so the wing ﬂ  ies straight in cruise ﬂ  ight. This is a  balance between the full power torque of the engine wanting  to turn it in one direction and minimum power when the WSC  aircraft is in a glide. WSC pilots usually have to exert some  pilot roll input for high power engines at full power climb to  ﬂ  y straight because of the engine turning effect.  

# Level Turns  

A turn is made by banking the wings in the direction of  the desired turn. A speciﬁ  c angle of bank is selected by the  pilot, control pressures are applied to achieve the desired  bank angle, and appropriate control pressures are exerted to  maintain the desired bank angle once it is established.  

# Trim Control  

The use of trim systems relieves the pilot of the requirement to  exert pressures for the desired ﬂ  ight condition. An improperly  trimmed aircraft requires constant control pressures, produces  pilot tension and fatigue, distracts the pilot from scanning,  and contributes to abrupt and erratic aircraft control.  

Banking is performed with the following steps  [Figure 6-9]:  

# Entering a Turn  

A. Straight ﬂ  ight  

B. Pilot applies sideways pressure to the control bar  shifting the weight towards the direction of the desired  turn initiating the bank. C. Turn is established and maintained by moving the  control bar back to the center position.  

# Exiting a Turn  

D. Pilot is maintaining stabilized bank and a resultant  turn. E. Pilot shifts weight to opposite side to initiate exit out  of the turn. F. Straight ﬂ  ight is established and maintained by moving  the control bar back to the center position.  

# Coordinating the Controls  

Flight controls are used in close coordination when making  level turns. Their functions are:  

•  The WSC is banked with side to side pressure with the  control bar and the bank angle established determines  the rate of turn at any given airspeed.  

•  The throttle provides additional thrust used to maintain  the WSC in level ﬂ  ight.  

•  Pitch control moves the nose of the WSC aircraft up  or down in relation to the pilot and perpendicular to  the wings. Doing this sets the proper pitch attitude and  speed in the turn.  

Turns are classified to determine the bank angle as  follows:  

•  Shallow turns are those in which the bank is less than  approximately   $20^{\circ}$  . •  Medium turns are those resulting from a degree of  bank that is approximately  $20^{\circ}$   to  $45^{\circ}$  .  •  Steep turns are those resulting from a degree of bank  that is  $45^{\circ}$   or more.  

Changing the direction of the wing’s lift toward one side or  the other causes the aircraft to be pulled in that direction.  

When an aircraft is flying straight and level, the total  lift is acting perpendicular to the wings and to the Earth.  [Figure 6-10]  As the WSC is banked into a turn, the lift  then becomes the resultant of two components. One, the  vertical lift component, continues to act perpendicular to  the Earth and opposes gravity. Second, the horizontal lift  component (centripetal) acts parallel to the Earth’s surface  

![](images/19e23d287057e8eb9e9a6598a593afd63b02ca3ee9b547064458f1cd023190dc.jpg)

and opposes inertia (apparent centrifugal force). These two  lift components act at right angles to each other causing the  resultant total lifting force to act perpendicular to the banked  wing of the aircraft. It is the horizontal lift component that  actually turns the WSC aircraft.  [Figure 6-10]  

Shallow turns are accomplished by moving the control bar  to the side slightly, waiting for the wing to roll the desired  amount, and then releasing the side pressure on the control bar  back to the center position. The WSC aircraft will stabilize in  the turn with no control pressures required. During a shallow  turn there is no signiﬁ  cant increase in airspeed or G forces  that can easily be noticed by the student.  [Figure 6-11]  Once  a shallow turn is initiated, it is a good practice to be stabilized  at a constant bank and then exit to a predetermined heading.  To exit the shallow turn, opposite sideways pressure must  be put on the control bar to bring the WSC aircraft back to  level ﬂ  ight.  

For higher banked turns, the entry speed should be well  above 1.3 times the stall speed, which increases signiﬁ  cantly  in higher banked turns. As an example, at least 1.5 times the  stall speed should be the entry speed for a 40 degree banked  turn to maintain the 1.3 times the stall speed safety margin.  Wings with a trim speed of 1.3 times the stall speed require  an increase in speed slightly. In all constant altitude, constant  airspeed turns, it is necessary to increase the angle of attack  of the wing when rolling into the turn by pushing out on  the control bar. This is required because part of the vertical  lift has been diverted to horizontal lift. Thus, the total lift  must be increased to compensate for this loss. Similarly, the  throttle must be increased to maintain the same altitude in  steeper banks.  

The additional load or G force in a medium banked turn is felt  as the pilot is pushed down on the seat with enough force for  this effect to be noticed. After the bank has been established  in a medium turn, all side-to-side roll pressure applied may  be relaxed, but forward pressure to maintain a higher angle of  attack is still necessary in a steeper bank. The WSC aircraft  remains at the selected bank with no further tendency to roll  back to level since all the forces are equalized.  

During the turn, roll, pitch, and throttle controls are adjusted  to maintain the desired bank angle, speed, and level altitude.  Coordinated ﬂ  ight is the coordination of the three controls  to achieve a smooth turn to the desired bank angle while  maintaining a constant speed and altitude.  

The roll-out from a turn is similar to the roll-in, except ﬂ  ight  controls are applied in the opposite direction. As the angle  of bank decreases, the pitch pressure should be relaxed as  necessary to maintain speed and the throttle decreased to  maintain altitude.  

Since the aircraft continues turning as long as there is any  bank, the rollout must be started before reaching the desired  heading. The amount of lead required to roll-out of the  desired heading depends on the degree of bank used in the  turn. Normally, the lead is one-half the degrees of bank.  For example, if the bank is  $30^{\circ}$  , lead the rollout by  $15^{\circ}$  . As  the wings become level, the control pressures should be  smoothly relaxed so that the controls are neutralized as the  aircraft returns to straight-and-level ﬂ  ight. As the rollout is  being completed, attention should be given to outside visual  references to determine that the wings are being leveled and  the turn stopped.

Figure 6-11.   Pilot’s view of a shallow turn with a  $20^{\circ}$   bank.  

To understand the relationship between airspeed, bank, and  radius of turn, it should be noted that the rate of turn at any  given true airspeed depends on the horizontal lift component.  The horizontal lift component varies in proportion to the  amount of bank. Therefore, the rate of turn at a given true  airspeed increases as the angle of bank is increased. On the  other hand, when a turn is made at a higher true airspeed at a  given bank angle, the inertia is greater and the horizontal lift  component required for the turn is greater causing the turning  rate to become slower. Therefore, at a given angle of bank, a  higher true airspeed makes the radius of turn larger because  the aircraft is turning at a slower rate.  [Figure 6-12]  

When changing from a shallow bank to a medium bank, the  airspeed of the wing on the outside of the turn increases in  relation to the inside wing as the radius of turn decreases. The  additional lift developed because of this increase in speed of  the wing balances the inherent lateral stability of the aircraft.  At any given airspeed, roll pressure is not required to maintain  the bank. If the bank is allowed to increase from a medium  to a steep bank, the radius of turn decreases further.  

A steep bank is similar to a medium bank but all factors  increase. Roll and pitch control pressures must increase,  throttle must increase further to maintain altitude, and the  G forces increase signiﬁ  cantly. Students should build up  to steep banked turns gradually after perfecting shallow  and medium banked turns. Do not exceed the bank angle  limitation in the Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH).  

The pilot’s posture while seated in the aircraft is very  important, particularly during turns. It affects the interpretation  of outside visual references. Pilots should not lean away from  the turn in an attempt to remain upright in relation to the  ground rather than ride with the aircraft. This should be a  habit developed early so that the pilot can properly learn to  use visual references.  

Beginning students should not use large control applications  because this produces a rapid roll rate and allows little time  for corrections before the desired bank is reached. Slower  (small control displacement) roll rates provide more time to  make necessary pitch and bank corrections. As soon as the  aircraft rolls from the wings-level attitude, the nose should  also start to move along the horizon, increasing its rate of  travel proportionately as the bank is increased.  

The following variations provide excellent guides. If the  nose moves up or down when entering a bank, excessive or  insufﬁ  cient pitch control is being applied. During all turns,  the controls are used to correct minor variations as they are  in straight-and-level ﬂ  ight.

Figure 6-12.   Angle of airspeed and bank regulate rate and radius of turn.  

Instruction in level turns should begin with changing attitude  from level to bank, bank to level, and so on with a slight pause  at the termination of each phase. This pause allows the WSC  to free itself from the effects of any misuse of the controls  and ensures a correct start for the next turn. During these  exercises, the idea of control forces, rather than movement,  should be emphasized by pointing out the resistance of the  controls to varying forces applied to them.  

Common errors in the performance of level turns are:  

•  Failure to adequately clear the area before beginning  the turn.  •  Attempting to sit up straight, in relation to the ground,  during a turn, rather than riding with the aircraft. •  Failure to maintain a constant bank angle during the  turn. •  Gaining proﬁ  ciency in turns in only one direction.  •  Failure to coordinate the angle of attack to maintain  the proper airspeed. •  Failure to coordinate the use of throttle to maintain  level ﬂ  ight. •  Altitude gain/loss during the turn.  

# Climbs and Climbing Turns  

When an aircraft enters a climb, it changes its ﬂ  ightpath  from level ﬂ  ight to an inclined plane or climb attitude. As  discussed in chapter 2, weight in a climb no longer acts in a  direction perpendicular to the ﬂ  ightpath. It acts in a rearward  direction. This causes an increase in total drag requiring an  increase in thrust (power) to balance the forces. An aircraft  can only sustain a climb angle when there is sufﬁ  cient thrust  to offset increased drag; therefore, climb is limited by the  thrust available.  [Figure 6-13]  

Like other maneuvers, climbs should be performed using  outside visual references and flight instruments. It is  important that the pilot know the engine power settings  and pitch attitudes that produce the following conditions  of climb:  

•  Normal climb—performed at an airspeed recommended  by the aircraft manufacturer. Normal climb speed is  generally the WSC best rate of climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   speed as  discussed below. Faster airspeeds should be used for  

climbing in turbulent air.  •  Best rate of climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  —the airspeed at which an  aircraft will gain the greatest amount of altitude in a  given unit of time (maximum rate of climb in feet per  minute (fpm)). The  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   made at full allowable power  is a maximum climb. This is the most efﬁ  cient speed  because it has the best lift over drag ratio for the  aircraft. This speed is also the best glide ratio speed  used for going the greatest distance for the amount  of altitude, as discussed later in this chapter. Each  aircraft manufacturer is different but a good rule of  thumb is that the   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   is 1.3 times the stall speed. It  must be fully understood that attempts to obtain more  climb performance than the aircraft is capable of by  increasing pitch attitude results in a decrease in the  

![](images/29a85c19a9ea0f127b43307a0dffe4b8cfd59f173efe57c778cb4d284fcd5dd8.jpg)  
Figure 6-13.   When a WSC aircraft stabilizes in a descent or a climb, the flightpath is a declined or inclined plane.  

rate of altitude gain. Trim is usually set at the  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   or  higher.  

•  Best angle of climb   $\mathrm{(V_{X})}$  —performed at an airspeed  that will produce the most altitude gain in a given  horizontal distance. Best  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   airspeed is lower than  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  but higher than minimum controlled airspeed. The  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  results in a steeper climb path, although the aircraft  takes longer to reach the same altitude than it would  at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  . The  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$  , therefore, is used in clearing obstacles  after takeoff. Since the  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   is closer to the stall speed,  caution should be exercised using this speed to  climb so as not to stall the WSC aircraft close to the  ground with potentially catastrophic consequences.  [Figure 6-14]  

Climbing flight requires more power than flying level,  as described in chapter 2. When performing a climb, the  normal climb speed should be established and the power  should be advanced to the climb power recommended by the  manufacturer. As the aircraft gains altitude during a climb,  the engine has a loss in power because the same volume of  air entering the engine’s induction system gradually decreases  in density as altitude increases.  

During a climb, a constant heading should be held with  the wings level if a straight climb is being performed, or  a constant angle of bank and rate of turn if a climbing turn  is being performed. To return to straight-and-level ﬂ  ight,  when approaching the target altitude, increase the speed  to the cruise setting (if different) and decrease throttle for  level ﬂ  ight. After the aircraft is established in level ﬂ  ight at  a constant altitude and the desired speed, the aircraft should  be trimmed (if equipped with an in ﬂ  ight trim system).  

In the performance of climbing turns, the following factors  should be considered.  

•  With a constant power setting, the same pitch attitude  and airspeed cannot be maintained in a bank as in  a straight climb due to the increase in the total lift  required.  •  The degree of bank should not be too steep. A steep  bank signiﬁ  cantly decreases the rate of climb. The  bank should always remain constant.  •  At a constant power setting and turning while climbing,  the WSC aircraft climbs at a slightly shallower climb  angle because some of the lift is being used to turn.  •  Attention should be looking at outside references and  scanning for trafﬁ  c with no more than 25 percent of  the time looking at inside ﬂ  ight deck instruments.  

There are two ways to establish a climbing turn. Either  establish a straight climb and then turn, or enter the climb  and turn simultaneously. Climbing turns should be used  when climbing to the local practice area. Climbing turns  allow better visual scanning, and it is easier for other pilots  to see a turning aircraft.  

In any turn, the loss of vertical lift and increased induced  drag due to increased angle of attack becomes greater as the  angle of bank is increased. So, shallow turns should be used  to maintain an efﬁ  cient rate of climb. All the factors that  affect the aircraft during level (constant altitude) turns affect  it during climbing turns or any other maneuver.

Figure 6-14.   Best angle of climb   $(V_{X})$   versus best rate of climb   $(V_{Y})$  .  

Common errors in the performance of climbs and climbing  turns are:  

•  A bank angle too high to achieve an efﬁ  cient climb. •  A speed too high to achieve an efﬁ  cient climb rate. •  A speed that is too low. •  Attempting to exceed the aircraft’s climb capability.  •  Inability to keep pitch and bank attitude constant  during climbing turns.  •  Attempting to establish climb pitch attitude by  referencing the airspeed indicator, resulting in  “chasing” the airspeed.  

# Descents and Descending Turns  

When an aircraft enters a descent, it changes its ﬂ  ightpath  from level to an inclined plane. It is important that the pilot  know the power settings and pitch attitudes that produce the  following conditions of descent.  

•  Partial power descent—the normal method of losing  altitude is to descend with partial power. This is often  termed “cruise” or “en route” descent. The airspeed  and power setting recommended by the aircraft  manufacturer for prolonged descent should be used.  The target descent rate should be 400–500 fpm.  

•  Steep approach—the normal maneuver used to  descend at a steep angle. This is typically used to  descend for landing if higher than expected upon  approaching the runway. The throttle is set to idle  and the airspeed is increased so the excessive drag  allows the WSC aircraft to descend at the steepest  angle. The control bar is pulled in to achieve this steep  approach—the further the bar is pulled in, the steeper  the descent rate. Each WSC aircraft is different, but  pulling the control bar to the chest may be necessary  to achieve the required angle.  

•  Descent at minimum safe airspeed—a nose-high  descent. This should only be used for unusual  situations such as clearing high obstacles for a short  runway in an emergency situation. The only advantage  is a steeper than normal descent angle. This is similar  to the best angle of climb speed and should only be  used with caution because stalling near the ground  could have catastrophic consequences for the pilot,  passenger, and people/property on the ground.  

•  Glide—a basic maneuver in which the aircraft loses  altitude in a controlled descent with little or no engine  power; forward motion is maintained by gravity  pulling the aircraft along an inclined path, and the  descent rate is controlled by the pilot balancing the  forces of gravity and lift.  [Figure 6-15]  

Although glides are directly related to the practice of power- off accuracy landings, they have a speciﬁ  c operational purpose  in normal landing approaches and forced landings after engine  failure. Therefore, it is necessary that they be performed more  subconsciously than other maneuvers because most of the  time during their execution, the pilot gives full attention to  details other than the mechanics of performing the maneuver.  Since glides are usually performed relatively close to the  ground, accuracy of their execution, the formation of proper  technique, and habits are of special importance.  

The glide ratio of a WSC aircraft is the distance the aircraft,  with power off, travels forward in relation to the altitude  it loses. For instance, if it travels 5,000 feet forward while  descending 1,000 feet, its glide ratio is said to be 5 to 1.  

The glide ratio is affected by all four fundamental forces that  act on an aircraft (weight, lift, drag, and thrust). If all factors  affecting the aircraft are constant, the glide ratio is constant.  

![](images/cb4aac72ffcc2fd0e37c40dfa812e98cb736218c2ca58d7165229d10b5b5aa1d.jpg)  
Figure 6-15.   Descent speeds and glide angles.  

Although the effect of wind is not covered in this section, it  is a very prominent force acting on the gliding distance of the  aircraft in relationship to its movement over the ground. With  a tailwind, the aircraft glides farther because of the higher  groundspeed. Conversely, with a headwind the aircraft does  not glide as far because of the slower groundspeed.  

Variations in weight for an aircraft with a rigid wing  do not affect the glide angle provided the pilot uses the  correct airspeed. Since it is the lift over drag   $\mathrm{(L_{D})}$   ratio that  determines the distance the aircraft can glide, weight does  not affect the distance. The glide ratio is based only on the  relationship of the aerodynamic forces acting on the aircraft.  The only effect weight has is to vary the time the aircraft  glides. The heavier the aircraft, the higher the airspeed must  be to obtain the same glide ratio. For example, if two aircraft  having the same  $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{D}}$   ratio but different weights start a glide  from the same altitude, the heavier aircraft gliding at a higher  airspeed arrives at the same touchdown point in a shorter  time. Both aircraft cover the same distance, only the lighter  aircraft takes a longer time.  

However, the WSC aircraft has different characteristics  because it has a ﬂ  exible airframe. As more weight is added  to the WSC wing, it ﬂ  exes more creating more twist in the  wing decreasing aerodynamic efﬁ  ciency, as discussed in  chapter 2. For example, a pilot is accustomed to a glide ratio  of 5 to 1 ﬂ  ying solo; a passenger is added, and this glide ratio  may decrease to 4 to 1. This decrease in glide ratio for added  weight is true for all descent speeds. The amount of decrease  in glide ratio varies signiﬁ  cantly between manufactures and  models because each wing ﬂ  exes differently. The more  ﬂ  exible the wing is, the greater the decrease in glide ratio.  Pilots should become familiar with glide ratios for their  aircraft at all speeds and all weights.  

Although the propeller thrust of the aircraft is normally  dependent on the power output of the engine, the throttle is  in the closed position during a glide so the thrust is constant.  Since power is not used during a glide or power-off approach,  the pitch attitude must be adjusted as necessary to maintain  a constant airspeed.  

The best speed for the glide is one at which the aircraft travels  the greatest forward distance for a given loss of altitude in still  air. This best glide speed corresponds to an angle of attack  resulting in the least drag on the aircraft and giving the best  lift-to-drag ratio (L DMAX ).  [Figure 6-16]  

![](images/e90f81b7a4e96f0a2c1d6a3f09f457bcaa5077b944939c297100bce17bdf0f3f.jpg)  

# Figure 6-16.  L DMAX .  

Any change in the gliding airspeed results in a proportionate  change in glide ratio. Any speed, other than the best glide  speed, results in more drag. Therefore, as the glide airspeed  is reduced or increased from the optimum or best glide speed,  the glide ratio is also changed. When descending at a speed  below the best glide speed, induced drag increases. When  descending at a speed above best glide speed, parasite drag  increases. In either case, the rate of descent increases and the  glide ratio decreases.  

This leads to a cardinal rule of aircraft ﬂ  ying that a student  pilot must understand and appreciate: the pilot must never  attempt to “stretch” a glide by applying nose up pressure and  reducing the airspeed below the aircraft’s recommended best  glide speed. Attempts to stretch a glide invariably result in an  increase in the rate and angle of descent and may precipitate  an inadvertent stall.  

To enter a glide, the pilot should close the throttle and  obtain the best glide speed. When the approximate gliding  pitch attitude is established, the airspeed indicator should  be checked. If the airspeed is higher than the recommended  speed, the pitch attitude is too low; if the airspeed is less than  recommended, the pitch attitude is too high. Therefore, the  pitch attitude should be readjusted accordingly by referencing  the horizon. After the adjustment has been made, the aircraft  should be retrimmed (if equipped) so that it maintains this  attitude without the need to hold pitch pressure on the control  bar. The principles of attitude ﬂ  ying require that the proper  ﬂ  ight attitude be established using outside visual references  ﬁ  rst, then using the ﬂ  ight instruments as a secondary check.  It is a good practice to always retrim the aircraft after each  pitch adjustment.  

A stabilized power-off descent at the best glide speed is  often referred to as a normal glide. The ﬂ  ight instructor  should demonstrate a normal glide, and direct the student  pilot to memorize the aircraft’s angle and speed by visually  checking the:  

1.  Aircraft’s attitude with reference to the horizon. 2.  Noting the pitch of the sound made by the air. 3.  Pressure on the controls, and the feel of the aircraft.  

Due to lack of experience, the beginning student may be  unable to recognize slight variations of speed and angle of  bank immediately by vision or by the pressure required on  the controls. The student pilot must use all three elements  consciously until they become habits, and must be alert when  attention is diverted from the attitude of the aircraft. A student  must be responsive to any warning given by a variation in  the feel of the aircraft or controls or by a change in the pitch  of the sound.  

After a good comprehension of the normal glide is attained,  the student pilot should be instructed of the differences in  the results of normal and abnormal glides. Abnormal glides  are those conducted at speeds other than the normal best  glide speed. Pilots who do not acquire an understanding and  appreciation of these differences experience difﬁ  culties with  accuracy landings which are comparatively simple if the  fundamentals of the glide are thoroughly understood.  

# Gliding Turns  

Gliding turns have a signiﬁ  cant increase in descent rate than  straight glides because of the decrease in effective lift due to  the direction of the lifting force being at an angle to the pull  of gravity. Therefore, it should be clearly understood that the  steeper the bank angle, the greater the descent rate.  

In gliding turns, the decrease in effective lift due to the  direction of the lifting force being at an angle to the pull  of gravity make it necessary to use more nose-up pressure  than is required for a straight glide. However, as discussed  earlier for steeper turns, airspeed must be maintained well  above stall speed which increases during turns or the WSC  could stall in the turn.  

When recovery is being made from a medium or high banked  gliding turn, the pitch force which was applied during the turn  must be decreased back to trim, which must be coordinated  with the roll back to level.  

In order to maintain the most efﬁ  cient or normal glide in a  turn, more altitude must be sacriﬁ  ced than in a straight glide  since this is the only way speed can be maintained without  power. Attention to the front tube angle with the horizon and  the reference point on the front tube provide visual reference  of attitudes while gliding.  [Figures 6-17  and  6-18]  

Common errors in the performance of descents and  descending turns are:  

•  Failure to adequately clear the area.  •  Inability to sense changes in airspeed through sound  and feel. •  Failure to maintain constant bank angle during gliding  turns.  •  Inadequate nose-up control during glide entry resulting  in too steep a glide.  •  Attempting to establish/maintain a normal glide solely  by reference to ﬂ  ight instruments.  •  Attempting to “stretch” the glide by applying nose-up  pressure.  •  Inadequate pitch control during recovery from straight  glides.  

# Pitch and Power  

No discussion of climbs and descents would be complete  without touching on the question of what controls altitude  and what controls airspeed. The pilot must understand the  effects of both power and pitch control, working together,  during different conditions of ﬂ  ight.  

As a general rule, power is used to determine vertical speed  and pitch control is used to determine speed. However,  there are many variations and combinations to this general  statement. Decreasing pitch and diving do provide a quicker  descent but is not typically used as a ﬂ  ight technique for long  descents. Changes in pitch through moving the control bar  forward and backward are used for maintaining level ﬂ  ight  in rising and falling air, and pulling back on the control bar is  used for a steep approach technique to lose altitude; however,  these techniques are used only for short durations and not  the primary altitude control for the WSC.  

The throttle is the main control used for determining vertical  speed. At normal pitch attitudes recommended by the  manufacturer and a constant airspeed, the amount of power  used determines whether the aircraft climbs, descends, or  remains level at that attitude.  

# Steep Turn Performance Maneuver  

The objective of the steep turn performance maneuver is to  develop the smoothness, coordination, orientation, division of  attention, and control techniques necessary for the execution  of maximum performance turns when the aircraft is near its

performance limits. Smoothness of control use, coordination,  and accuracy of execution are the important features of this  maneuver.  

The steep turn maneuver consists of a level turn in either  direction using a bank angle between  $45^{\circ}$   to  $60^{\circ}$  . This causes  an overbanking tendency during which maximum turning  performance is attained and relatively high load factors are  imposed. Because of the high load factors imposed, these  turns should be performed at an airspeed that does not exceed  the aircraft’s design maneuvering speed   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$  . The principles  of an ordinary steep turn apply, but as a practice maneuver  the steep turns should be continued until  $360^{\circ}$   or  $720^{\circ}$   of turn  have been completed.  [Figure 6-19]  

An aircraft’s maximum turning performance is its fastest  rate of turn and its shortest radius of turn, which change  with both airspeed and angle of bank. Each aircraft’s turning  performance is limited by the amount of power its engine is  developing, its limit load factor (structural strength), and its  aerodynamic characteristics. Do not exceed the maximum  bank angle limitation in the POH. For example, a maximum   $60^{\circ}$   bank angle is a limit used by many manufacturers.  

The pilot should realize the tremendous additional load that  is imposed on an aircraft as the bank is increased beyond   $45^{\circ}$  . During a coordinated turn with a  $60^{\circ}$   bank, a load factor  of approximately  $2\:\mathrm{fs}$   is placed on the aircraft’s structure.  

Regardless of the airspeed or the type of aircraft involved,  a given angle of bank in a turn during which altitude is  maintained always produces the same load factor. Pilots must  be aware that an additional load factor increases the stalling  speed at a signiﬁ  cant rate—stalling speed increases with the  square root of the load factor. For example, a light aircraft that  stalls at 40 knots in level ﬂ  ight stalls at nearly 57 knots in a   $60^{\circ}$   bank. The pilot’s understanding and observance of this  fact is an indispensable safety precaution for the performance  of all maneuvers requiring turns.  

Before starting the steep turn, the pilot should ensure that the  area is clear of other air trafﬁ  c since the rate of turn is quite  rapid. After establishing the manufacturer’s recommended  entry speed or the design maneuvering speed, the aircraft  should be smoothly rolled into a selected bank angle between   $45^{\circ}$   to  $60^{\circ}$   and the throttle increased to maintain level ﬂ  ight.  Always perfect the steep turn at   $45^{\circ}$   and slowly work up to  higher bank angles. As the turn is being established, control  bar forward pressure should be smoothly increased to  increase the angle of attack. This provides the additional wing  lift required to compensate for the increasing load factor.  

After the selected bank angle has been reached, the pilot  ﬁ  nds that considerable force is required on the control bar  and increased throttle is required to hold the aircraft in level  ﬂ  ight—to maintain altitude. Because of this increase in the  force applied to the control bar, the load factor increases  

![](images/fb89ea03fa4b0002539a361545434c8f40db184433aa355f5f9ad538aefe7379.jpg)

rapidly as the bank is increased. Additional control bar  forward pressure increases the angle of attack, which results  in an increase in drag. Consequently, power must be added  to maintain the entry altitude and airspeed.  

During the turn, the pilot should not stare at any one object.  Maintaining altitude, as well as orientation, requires an  awareness of the relative position of the forward tube and  the horizon. The pilot must also be looking for other aircraft  mainly towards the direction of the turn while glancing at the  instruments to make sure the airspeed and altitude are being  maintained. If the altitude begins to increase or decrease a  power adjustment may be necessary to maintain the altitude  if the bank angle and speed are maintained. All bank angle  changes should be done with coordinated use of pitch and  throttle control.  

The rollout from the turn should be timed so that the wings  reach level ﬂ  ight when the aircraft is exactly on the heading  from which the maneuver was started. While the recovery  is being made, forward bar pressure is gradually released  and power reduced, as necessary, to maintain the altitude  and airspeed.  

Common errors in the performance of steep turns are:  

•   Failure to adequately clear the area. •   Excessive pitch change during entry or recovery. •   Attempts to start recovery prematurely. •   Failure to stop the turn on a precise heading. •   Inadequate power management resulting in gaining  or loosing altitude. •   Inadequate airspeed control. •   Poor roll/pitch/power coordination. •   Failure to maintain constant bank angle. •   Failure to scan for other trafﬁ  c before and during the  maneuver.  

# Energy Management  

The WSC aircraft has very little momentum because of its  relative light weight as compared to airplanes. Therefore, it  is important that pilots learn to manage the kinetic energy of  the WSC. Higher speed and higher power is higher energy.  Lower speed and lower power is lower energy. The ability  for a pilot to maintain high energy levels in turbulent air and  while near the ground is the basis for energy management  for WSC.  

Energy management should ﬁ  rst be practiced at higher  altitudes. While maintaining straight-and-level flight,  power is increased and decreased, and pitch control must  be used. The pilot should start at the trim position and with  the appropriate cruise throttle setting. As power is smoothly  applied towards full throttle, the WSC aircraft pitch attitude  attempts to increase. The pilot should decrease the pitch to  maintain level ﬂ  ight. This results in a high energy level.  

Once this application is held for a couple seconds, the pilot  should then smoothly reduce power to the cruise power  setting and increase pitch to maintain level ﬂ  ight. The WSC  aircraft is now back to at a lower trim/cruise power in a  medium energy level.  

Again, increase power and reduce pitch to stay level attaining  a high energy level. Now, reduce power to idle and as the  nose lowers, increase pitch. The pilot must be aware of the  decreasing energy levels occurring during this phase of the  maneuver for this is usually a precursor to accidents when  approaching the runway. The pilot should recognize this  scenario and promptly apply the power as appropriate to  prevent the aircraft from descending. Additionally, the pilot  must be aware of the slow ﬂ  ight and stall characteristics to  prevent a stall and to maintain a speciﬁ  ed heading.  

Once the student masters this maneuver successfully at  higher altitudes, energy management can be practiced with  low passes down the runway in calm winds at higher energy  levels, then at the lower trim/cruise power medium energy  level, and ﬁ  nally higher to medium trim/cruise power energy  levels. Low passes over the runway ﬁ  ne tunes the student’s  skills for energy management and is an excellent exercise to  prepare students for landings.  

It is important to understand that higher energy levels should  be used while maneuvering near the ground especially  in turbulent or crosswind conditions. This is discussed in  Chapter 7, Takeoff and Departure Climbs, that higher energy  is recommended as the WSC aircraft lifts off and initially  climbs out from the runway.  

Higher energy is also recommended for a power on approach  where the airspeed is higher than the normal approach  speed; and the power is higher than the normal approach  power. There is still a descent rate, but the WSC aircraft has  more overall energy to handle turbulence and crosswinds.  [Figure 6-20]

# Slow Flight and Stalls  

As discussed in chapter 2, the maintenance of lift and control  of an aircraft in slow ﬂ  ight requires a certain minimum  airspeed and angle of attack. This critical airspeed depends  on certain factors, such as gross weight, load factors, and  density altitude. The minimum speed below which further  controlled ﬂ  ight is impossible is called the stalling speed.  An important feature of pilot training is the development  of the ability to estimate and “feel” the margin of speed  above the stalling speed. Also, the ability to determine the  characteristic responses of the aircraft at different airspeeds  is of great importance to the pilot. The student pilot,  therefore, must develop this awareness in order to safely  avoid stalls and to operate an aircraft correctly and safely  at slow airspeeds.  

As discussed in chapter 2, the nose stalls while the tips keep  ﬂ  ying. Therefore, the deﬁ  nition of stall speed of the WSC  aircraft is the speed at which the nose starts stalling. The  control bar is pushed forward and buffeting is felt on the  control bar as the root reaches the critical angle of attack.  Separation of the laminar airﬂ  ow occurs, creating turbulence  that can be felt in the control bar. There is a loss of positive  roll control as the nose buffets and lowers as it loses lift.  

# Slow Flight  

The objective of maneuvering during slow flight is to  develop the pilot’s sense of feel and ability to use the  controls correctly and to improve proﬁ  ciency in performing  maneuvers that require slow airspeeds.  

Slow ﬂ  ight is broken down into two distinct speeds:  

1.    $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   and the short ﬁ  eld descent speed that was discussed  earlier, and,  2.  Minimum controlled airspeed, the slowest airspeed at  which the aircraft is capable of maintaining controlled  ﬂ  ight without indications of a stall—usually 2 to 3  knots above stalling speed as discussed below.  

The minimum controlled airspeed maneuver demonstrates  the ﬂ  ight characteristics and degree of controllability of the  aircraft at its minimum ﬂ  ying speed. By deﬁ  nition, the term  “ﬂ  ight at minimum controllable airspeed” means a speed at  which any further increase in angle of attack or load factor  causes an immediate stall. Instruction in ﬂ  ight at minimum  controllable airspeed should be introduced at reduced power  settings with the airspeed sufﬁ  ciently above the stall to  permit maneuvering, but close enough to the stall to sense the  characteristics of ﬂ  ight at very low airspeed—sloppy control,  ragged response to control inputs, difﬁ  culty maintaining  altitude, etc. Maneuvering at minimum controllable airspeed  should be performed using both instrument indications and  outside visual reference. It is important that pilots form the  habit of frequent reference to the ﬂ  ight instruments, especially  the airspeed indicator, while ﬂ  ying at very low airspeeds.  However, the goal is to develop a “feel” for the aircraft at  very low airspeeds to avoid inadvertent stalls and to operate  the aircraft with precision.  

The objective of performing the minimum controlled airspeed  is to ﬂ  y straight and level and make shallow level turns at  minimum controlled airspeed. To begin a minimum controlled  airspeed maneuver, the WSC is ﬂ  own at trim speed straight and  level to maintain a constant altitude. The nose is then raised as  the throttle is reduced to maintain a constant altitude.  

As the speed decreases further, the pilot should note the  feel of the ﬂ  ight controls, pitch pressure, and difﬁ  culty of  maintaining a straight heading with the increased side-to-side  pilot input forces required to keep the wings level. At some  point the throttle must be increased to remain level after the  WSC has slowed below it’s maximum  $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{D}}$   speed. The pilot  should also note the sound of the airﬂ  ow as it falls off in tone.  There is a large difference by manufacturer and model, but  the bar generally should not be touching the forward tube  at minimum controlled airspeed. For example, the control  bar would be 1 to 3 inches from the front tube at minimum  controlled airspeed.  [Figure 6-21]  

![](images/1c726afcc977514aaefa561a620461a66204b17cbceb906a0b6982935c553903.jpg)  
Figure 6-21.   Minimum controlled airspeed maneuver.  

The pilot should understand that when ﬂ  ying below the  minimum drag speed   $\mathrm{(L/D_{MAX})}$  , the aircraft exhibits a  characteristic known as “speed instability.” If the aircraft  is disturbed by even the slightest turbulence, the airspeed  decreases. As airspeed decreases, the total drag increases  resulting in a further loss in airspeed. Unless more power is  applied and/or the nose is lowered, the speed continues to  decay to a stall. This is an extremely important factor in the  performance of slow ﬂ  ight. The pilot must understand that, at  speeds less than minimum drag speed, the airspeed is unstable  and will continue to decay if allowed to do so.  

It should also be noted that the amount of power to remain  level at minimum controlled airspeed is greater than that  required at the minimum drag speed which is also the best  glide ratio speed and the best rate of climb speed.  

When the attitude, airspeed, and power have been stabilized  in straight-and-level ﬂ  ight, turns should be practiced to  determine the aircraft’s controllability characteristics at  this minimum speed. During the turns, power and pitch  attitude may need to be increased to maintain the airspeed  and altitude. The objective is to acquaint the pilot with the  lack of maneuverability at minimum controlled airspeed, the  danger of incipient stalls, and the tendency of the aircraft  to stall as the bank is increased. A stall may also occur as a  result of turbulence, or abrupt or rough control movements  when ﬂ  ying at this critical airspeed.  

Once ﬂ  ight at minimum controllable airspeed is set up  properly for level ﬂ  ight, a descent or climb at minimum  controllable airspeed can be established by adjusting the  power as necessary to establish the desired rate of descent  or climb.  

Common errors in the performance of slow ﬂ  ight are: •   Failure to adequately clear the area.  

•   Inadequate forward pressure as power is reduced,  resulting in altitude loss. •   Excessive forward pressure as power is reduced,  resulting in a climb, followed by a rapid reduction in  airspeed and “mushing.” •   Inadequate compensation for unanticipated roll during  turns. •   Fixation on the airspeed indicator. •   Inadequate power management. •   Inability to adequately divide attention between  aircraft control and orientation.  

# Stalls  

A stall occurs when the smooth airﬂ  ow over the aircraft’s  wing root is disrupted and the lift degenerates rapidly. This  is caused when the wing root exceeds its critical angle of  attack. This can occur at any airspeed in any attitude with  any power setting.  

The practice of stall recovery and the development of  awareness of stalls are of primary importance in pilot  training. The objectives in performing intentional stalls are to  familiarize the pilot with the conditions that produce stalls, to  assist in recognizing an approaching stall, and to develop the  habit of taking prompt preventive or corrective action.  

Pilots must recognize the ﬂ  ight conditions that are conducive  to stalls and know how to apply the necessary corrective  action. They should learn to recognize an approaching stall  by sight, sound, and feel. The following cues may be useful  in recognizing the approaching stall:  

•   Positioning the control bar toward the front tube •   Detecting a stall condition by visually noting the  attitude of the aircraft for the power setting  

•   Hearing the wind decrease on the structure and  pilot •   Feeling the wind decrease against the pilot •   Sensing changes in direction or speed of motion,  or kinesthesia—probably the most important and  best indicator to the trained and experienced pilot.  If this sensitivity is properly developed, it warns of  a decrease in speed or the beginning of a settling or  mushing of the aircraft.  

During the practice of intentional stalls, the real objective  is not to learn how to stall an aircraft, but to learn how to  recognize an approaching stall and take prompt corrective  action. Though the recovery actions must be taken in a  coordinated manner, they are broken down into the following  three actions for explanation purposes.  

First, at the indication of a stall, the pitch attitude and angle  of attack must be decreased positively and immediately.  Since the basic cause of a stall is always an excessive angle  of attack, the cause must ﬁ  rst be eliminated by releasing the  control bar forward pressure that was necessary to attain that  angle of attack or by moving the control bar backwards. This  lowers the nose and returns the wing to an effective angle  of attack.  

The amount of movement used depends on the design of  the wing, the severity of the stall, and the proximity of the  ground. In some WSC aircraft, the bar can be left out and  as the nose stalls, the wing lowers to an angle of attack and  keeps ﬂ  ying since the tips do not stall. However, even though  WSC aircraft generally have gentle stall characteristics,  higher performance wings may not be as forgiving. Therefore  during a stall, the control bar should be moved back to reduce  the angle of attack and properly recover from the stall. The  object for all WSC aircraft is to reduce the angle of attack  but only enough to allow the wing to regain lift as quickly as  possible and obtain the appropriate airspeed for the situation  with the minimum loss in altitude.  

Power application in a stall is different than an airplane. Since  power application in a WSC aircraft produces a nose-up  moment after a stall has occurred and the pitch has decreased  from the control bar movement, power should be applied.  The ﬂ  ight instructor should emphasize, however, that power  is not essential for a safe stall recovery if sufﬁ  cient altitude  is available. Reducing the angle of attack is the only way of  recovering from a stall regardless of the amount of power  used. Stall recoveries should be practiced with and without  the use of power. Usually, the greater the power applied  during the stall recovery, the less the loss of altitude.  

Third, straight-and-level ﬂ  ight should be regained with  coordinated use of all controls. Practice of power-on stalls  should be avoided due to potential danger of whipstalls, tucks,  and tumbles, as detailed later in ths chapter.  

Power-off (at idle) turning stalls are practiced to show  what could happen if the controls are improperly used  during a turn from the base leg to the ﬁ  nal approach. The  power-off straight-ahead stall simulates the attitude and  ﬂ  ight characteristics of a particular aircraft during the ﬁ  nal  approach and landing.  

Usually, the first few practices should include only  approaches to stalls with recovery initiated as soon as the  ﬁ  rst buffeting or partial loss of control is noted. Once the  pilot becomes comfortable with this power-off procedure,  the aircraft should use some power and be slowed in such  a manner that it stalls in as near a level pitch attitude as is  possible. The student pilot must not be allowed to form the  impression that in all circumstances a high pitch attitude is  necessary to exceed the critical angle of attack, or that in all  circumstances a level or near level pitch attitude is indicative  of a low angle of attack. Recovery should be practiced ﬁ  rst  without the addition of power by merely relieving enough  control bar forward pressure that the stall is broken and the  aircraft assumes a normal glide attitude. Stall recoveries  should then be practiced with the addition of power during  the recovery to determine how effective power is in executing  a safe recovery and minimizing altitude loss.  

Stall accidents usually result from an inadvertent stall at a  low altitude in which a recovery was not accomplished prior  to contact with the surface. As a preventive measure, stalls  should be practiced at a minimum altitude of 1,500 feet  AGL or that which allows recovery no lower than 1,000 feet  AGL. Recovery with a minimum loss of altitude requires a  reduction in the angle of attack (lowering the aircraft’s pitch  attitude), application of power, and termination of the descent  without accelerating to a high airspeed and unnecessary  altitude loss.  

The factors that affect the stalling characteristics of the aircraft  are wing design, trim, bank, pitch attitude, coordination,  drag, and power. The pilot should learn the effect of the  stall characteristics of the aircraft being ﬂ  own. It should  be reemphasized that a stall can occur at any airspeed, in  any attitude, or at any power setting, depending on the total  number of factors affecting the particular aircraft.  

Whenever practicing turning stalls, a constant pitch and  bank attitude should be maintained until the stall occurs.  In a banked stall or if the wing rolls as it stalls, side to side  control bar movement is required to level the wings as well  as pull the bar back to reduce the angle of attack.  

# Power-Off Stall Manuever  

The practice of power-off stalls is usually performed with  normal landing approach conditions in simulation of an  accidental stall occurring during landing approaches. Aircraft  equipped with trim should be trimmed to the approach  conﬁ  guration. Initially, airspeed in excess of the normal  approach speed should not be carried into a stall entry since  it could result in an abnormally nose-high attitude. Before  executing these practice stalls, the pilot must be sure the area  is clear of other air trafﬁ  c.  

To start the power-off stall maneuver, reduce the throttle to  idle (or normal approach power). Increase airspeed to the  normal approach speed and maintain that airspeed. When the  approach attitude and airspeed have stabilized, the aircraft’s  nose should be smoothly raised to an attitude that induces a  stall. If the aircraft’s attitude is raised too slowly, the WSC  aircraft may slow only to minimum controlled airspeed and  not be able to reach an angle of attack that is high enough  to stall. The position of the control bar at which the WSC  stalls can vary greatly for different manufacturers and makes/ models. Some can stall abruptly when the control bar is inches  from the front tube.  

If the aircraft’s attitude is raised too quickly, the pitch attitude  could rise above the manufacturer’s limitation. A good rule  of thumb is 3 to 4 seconds from stabilized approach speed to  pull the control bar full forward. The wings should be kept  level and a constant pitch attitude maintained until the stall  occurs. The stall is recognized by clues, such as buffeting,  increasing descent rate, and nose down pitching.  

Recovering from the stall should be accomplished by  reducing the angle of attack by pulling the bar back and  accelerating only to the trim speed while simultaneously  increasing the throttle to minimize altitude loss if needed.  Once the WSC accelerated to trim speed, the control bar can  be pushed out to return back to normal trim attitude and speed.  If there is any rolling during the stall or the stall recovery  the control bar should be moved side to side to maintain a  straight heading.  

It is not necessary to go into a steep dive in a WSC aircraft  to recover from a stall. This only loses more altitude than  required and should be discouraged. The nose should be  lowered as necessary to regain ﬂ  ying speed and returned to  a normal ﬂ  ight attitude as soon as possible.  [Figure 6-22]  

Recovery from power-off stalls should also be practiced from  shallow banked turns to simulate an inadvertent stall during  a turn from base leg to ﬁ  nal approach. During the practice of  these stalls, care should be taken that the turn continues at a  uniform rate until the complete stall occurs. When stalling in  a turn, it does not affect the recovery procedure. The angle of  attack is reduced and the wings leveled simultaneously with  power applied if needed for altitude control. In the practice of  turning stalls, no attempt should be made to stall the aircraft  on a predetermined heading. However, to simulate a turn  from base to ﬁ  nal approach, the stall normally should be  made to occur within a heading change of approximately  $90°$  .  After the stall occurs, the recovery should be made straight  ahead with minimum loss of altitude, and accomplished in  accordance with the recovery procedure discussed earlier.

# Whip Stall and Tumble Awareness  

As discussed in chapter 2, the WSC aircraft does not have a  tail with a vertical stabilizer similar to an airplane, and there  is the possibility of the wing tucking and tumbling. If a WSC  tumbles, this will most likely result in a structural failure  of the WSC and serious injury or death to the pilot and/or  passenger. It is most important for the pilot to understand  tumble awareness and use all means to avoid such an  occurrence. The pilot can avoid a tuck and tumble by:  

•  Flying within the manufacturer’s limitations.  •  Flying in conditions that are not conducive to tucks  and tumbles. •  Obtaining the proper training in pitch stability for the  WSC.  

Flying within the manufacturer’s pitch and airspeed  limitations is simply adhering to the POH/AFM limitations.  Depending on the manufacturer, this could mean no full  power stalls, not exceeding pitch limits of  $\pm\,40$   pitch angle,  not ﬂ  ying below the safe ﬂ  ying speed in turbulence, etc.  Manufacturer’s limitations are provided for the speciﬁ  c  aircraft to avoid tucks and tumbles.  

Preﬂ  ight preparation is the ﬁ  rst step to avoid the possibility  of a tuck/tumble to avoid ﬂ  ying in strong weather conditions.  This could be strong winds that create wind shear or strong  convective thermals that create updrafts and downdrafts. This  weather analysis is part of the preﬂ  ight preparation weather  analysis. The second pilot decision regarding appropriate  weather while ﬂ  ying is to look at the environment during  ﬂ  ight to understand and evaluate the situation. Weather  conditions should always be evaluated as the ﬂ  ight progresses  with ADM used to determine the best outcome for the  situation. This could be turning back or landing depending  on the situation.  

As a student or pilot progresses, turbulence will be  encountered. Use the procedures for ﬂ  ying straight and level  as shown in  Figure 6-8.  Use this exercise as a foundation for  developing pitch control awareness to keep the wing managed  with proper control bar pitch and throttle control.  

For high pitch angles, the POH may have speciﬁ  c procedures  that should be followed for the particular WSC aircraft,  but the following general guidelines are provided. After  reviewing the aerodynamic aspects of the tuck/tumble in  chapter 2, refer to the following tuck/tumble awareness and  avoidance procedures.  

As deﬁ  ned in the aerodynamics section, a whip stall is a high  pitch angle when the tips stall because they exceed the critical  angle of attack. This can be the result of strong turbulence  or power-on stall, pilot induced, or any combination of  these factors. A pilot must avoid all of these factors to avoid  the possibility of a whip stall resulting in a tumble, but the  following procedures are provided for tumble avoidance  in case a whip stall or a nose rotating down below the  manufacturer’s limitations is encountered.  

The aircraft rotates nose down.  [Figure 6-23,  Whip Stall  to  Phase 1]  Push the control bar out to the  front tube and level wings while increasing to full power  and keeping control bar full out to reduce overpitching.  [Figure 6-23, Phase 1  to  Phase 2]  If rotation is so severe that  it progresses to phase 4 and the WSC aircraft is tumbling, the  ballistic parachute (if so equipped) should be deployed.  

There are other weather situations in which the nose is not  at a high pitch attitude, where the back of the wing can get  pushed up and enter phase 1 without an unusually high pitch  attitude or whip stall. If pitched nose low, increase to full  power while pushing the control bar full out to reduce nose- down pitching rotation. Generally, the control bar full out  and full throttle create a nose-up moment.  

It takes extremely strong weather conditions and/or pilot  error to tuck/tumble a WSC aircraft. Experienced pilots ﬂ  y  all day in moderate turbulence, but building experience ﬂ  ying  in turbulence should be approached slowly and cautiously to  determine the pilot and aircraft capabilities and limitations.  

# A Scenario  

The following is one example of a scenario that could lead to  a tuck/tumble. It is based on a viable training program in one  location but lack of experience in another location.  

A student obtains his or her pilot’s license with the minimum  number of hours for the pilot certiﬁ  cate. The new pilot trained,  soloed, and obtained his or her license only in conditions near  the ocean where there was typically an inverted midday sea  breeze with little to no convective turbulence (thermals). This  developed conﬁ  dence for ﬂ  ying in winds up to 15 knots but  no experience was gained in thermals. In fact, the pilot was  not aware that strong thermals could be hazardous.  

Now, with a new license, the pilot visits his parents in the  middle of the high desert of Colorado. Unfamiliar with  the local conditions, the new pilot gets a weather report  of winds to 15 knots, something the pilot has experienced  before. By the time the pilot arrives at the airport, discusses  the situation with the airport ofﬁ  cials, and sets up the WSC  aircraft, it is 2:00 in the afternoon. The wind is generally calm  but increasing to 15 knots occasionally. There are towering  cumulus clouds in the sky surrounding the current airport  similar to clouds that the pilot had seen far inland from where  he or she took instruction and soloed.  

The pilot takes off in relatively calm winds, but it is unusually  bumpy air. Without any experience in the high desert or with  thermal conditions, the pilot has misjudged the conditions and  is ﬂ  ying in strong thermal convection. The new pilot climbs  out trying to get above the turbulence, which usually works  near the beach because of the mechanical turbulence near the  ground. However, the turbulence increases.  

As the pilot is climbing to a pattern altitude of 1,000 feet  AGL at full throttle, the aircraft is pitched nose up while the  pilot lets the force of the updraft raise the nose. Never has  the pilot felt the nose rise with this type of force before. The  pilot is shocked and disoriented at this high pitch attitude,  but eventually lets up on the throttle. But now at an unusually  high pitch angle, the WSC nose ﬂ  ies into the downdraft of  the thermal. At the same time, the updraft is still pushing up  on the tips of the wing while the downdraft is pushing down  on the nose creating a forward rotation with a weightless  sensation. Before the pilot knows it, the wing is rotating  pitch down for a vertical dive.  [Phase 1  in  Figure 6-23]  The  student remembers from training that “in a nose down rotation  into a steep dive the control bar is pushed full forward and  full throttle applied” and initiates this corrective action. The  pilot reaches the vertical dive, but because of the corrective  action the WSC aircraft recovers from the dive and proceeds  back to land safely.  

What went wrong? What were the errors? How could this  near catastrophe have been avoided?  

•  In a new area and unfamiliar with the conditions, the  new pilot should have asked the local instructor or  other pilots about the conditions for the day. Local  WSC pilots are a great resource for ﬂ  ying the local  conditions, but pilots of any category aircraft are  knowledgeable of the conditions and could have  provided advice for the new pilot. This might have  prevented the new pilot from attempting this ﬂ  ight. •  Flying in a new environment and not understanding  the power of midday thermals in the high desert should  have forced the new pilot to scrap this midday ﬂ  ight.  The pilot should have started ﬂ  ying in the morning  when there is little thermal convection and gained  experience and understanding about the weather in  this new area.

•  Better preflight planning should have been  accomplished, especially in a new location. The pilot  should have known to obtain convective information  and realize it was going to be too bumpy for his or  her limited experience. The pilot was accustomed  to seeing towering cumulus clouds where he or she  trained, but they were way inland and not in the normal  ﬂ  ying area. Here clouds were observed all around.  

•  Site observations indicated strong thermal activity.  Observation of winds picking up to 15 knots and then  becoming calm normally indicates thermal activity.  The pilot was familiar with steady 15 knot winds,  but did not understand that calm wind increasing  cyclically to 15 knots indicates thermal activity.  

•  The pilot did not initially react to the updraft and  resultant high pitch angle properly because pitch  management habits had not been developed. The pilot  hit the updraft and allowed the force of the updraft  to move the control bar forward, increasing the pitch  angle while not letting up on the throttle immediately.  Both the control bar forward and full throttle forced  the nose too high, creating the high pitch angle and  whip stall condition. At the same time, the WSC  aircraft ﬂ  ew into the downdraft, starting the nose- down rotation.  

•  If the pilot had reacted quickly, pulled in the bar while  letting up on the throttle and immediately going into  the strong thermal, the high pitch angle would not have  been achieved and the strong forward rotation would  not have happened so abruptly.  

After the series of errors occurred, the pilot ﬁ  nally performed  the preventive action to avoid a tumble—from the basic  training of “If the WSC is at a high pitch angle and the  nose starts to rotate down to a low pitch angle, increase to  full power while pushing the control bar full out to avoid a  tumble.”  

# Chapter Summary  

Knowledge of the effects and use of the controls is basic to  develop a “feel” of the aircraft and become accustomed to  “attitude” ﬂ  ying. This is the basis for all ﬂ  ight maneuvers. The  four basic WSC ﬂ  ight maneuvers requiring pilot proﬁ  ciency  are:  

•  Straight-and-level ﬂ  ight. •  Level turns. •  Climbs and climbing turns. •  Descents and descending turns.  

Once the basic maneuvers are mastered, the steep turn allows  the pilot to achieve maximum performance from the aircraft.  Energy management techniques provide the basis for ﬂ  ying in  different atmospheric conditions and introduce the student to  precise pitch and power control. Slow ﬂ  ight and stall provide  the pilot an awareness of the ability of the WSC to ﬂ  y at the  lower end of the WSC performance.  

Whip stalls and tumbles are unique to WSC ﬂ  ight, and pilot  awareness and avoidance is an important concept for WSC  pilots to understand.  

# Takeoff and  Departure Climbs  

# Introduction  

This chapter discusses takeoffs and departure climbs in  weight-shift control (WSC) aircraft with tricycle landing  gear under normal conditions, crosswinds, and under  conditions which require maximum performance. A thorough  knowledge of takeoff principles, both in theory and practice,  is extremely valuable throughout a pilot’s career. It often  prevents an attempted takeoff that would result in an accident,  or during an emergency, makes a takeoff possible under  critical conditions in which a pilot with less knowledge and  lesser technique would normally fail.

The takeoff, though relatively simple, often presents the most  hazards of any part of a ﬂ  ight. The importance of thorough  knowledge, faultless technique, and sound judgment cannot  be overemphasized.  

It must be remembered that the manufacturer’s recommended  procedures, including conﬁ  guration and airspeeds, and other  information relevant to takeoffs and departure climbs in  a speciﬁ  c make and model WSC aircraft are contained in  the Airplane Flight Manual/Pilot’s Operating Handbook  (AFM/POH). If any of the information in this chapter differs  from the manufacturer’s recommendations as contained in  the AFM/POH, the manufacturer’s recommendations take  precedence.  

# Terms and Deﬁ  nitions  

Although the takeoff and climb is one continuous maneuver,  it is divided into three separate steps for purposes of  explanation: takeoff roll, lift-off, and initial climb after  becoming airborne.  [Figure 7-1]  

•   Takeoff roll (  ground roll)—the portion of the takeoff  procedure during which the aircraft is accelerated from  standstill to an airspeed that provides sufﬁ  cient lift for  it to become airborne. •   Lift-off (  rotation)—the act of becoming airborne as a  result of the wings lifting the aircraft off the ground  or the pilot rotating the nose up, increasing the angle  of attack to start a climb. •   Initial climb—begins when the aircraft leaves the  ground and an initial pitch attitude has been established  to climb away from the takeoff area. Normally, it is  considered complete when the aircraft has reached a  safe maneuvering altitude, or an en route climb has  been established.  

# Prior to Takeoff  

Before taxiing onto the runway or takeoff area, the pilot  should ensure that the engine is operating properly and that  all controls, including trim (if equipped), are set in accordance  with the before takeoff checklist. In addition, the pilot must  make certain that the approach and takeoff paths are clear  of other aircraft. At uncontrolled airports, pilots should  announce their intentions on the common trafﬁ  c advisory  frequency (CTAF) assigned to that airport. When operating  from an airport with an operating control tower, pilots must  contact the tower operator and receive a takeoff clearance  before taxiing onto the active runway.  

It is not recommended to take off immediately behind  another aircraft, particularly large, heavily loaded transport  airplanes because of the wake turbulence that is generated.  Even smaller aircraft can generate vortices that can cause the  WSC aircraft to lose control during takeoff. Always wait for  aircraft vortices to clear before taking off.  

While taxiing onto the runway, the pilot can select ground  reference points that are aligned with the runway direction  as aids to maintaining directional control during the takeoff.  These may be runway centerline markings, runway lighting,  distant trees, towers, buildings, or mountain peaks.  

# Normal Takeoff  

A normal takeoff is one in which the aircraft is headed into  the wind, or the wind is very light. Also, the takeoff surface is  ﬁ  rm and of sufﬁ  cient length to permit the aircraft to gradually  accelerate to normal lift-off and climb-out speed, and there  are no obstructions along the takeoff path.  

![](images/a534e757042c6bb9f923f5b6afac2bbe53137be3452aaf3a8133846ebc64b7cb.jpg)  
Figure 7-1.   Takeoff and climb.  

There are two reasons for making a takeoff as nearly into  the wind as possible. First, the aircraft’s speed while on  the ground is much lower than if the takeoff were made  downwind, thus reducing wear and stress on the landing  gear. Second, a shorter ground roll and, therefore, much  less runway length is required to develop the minimum lift  necessary for takeoff and climb. Since the aircraft depends  on airspeed in order to ﬂ  y, a headwind provides some of that  airspeed, even with the aircraft motionless, from the wind  ﬂ  owing over the wings.  

# Takeoff Roll  

After taxiing onto the runway, the WSC aircraft should be  carefully aligned with the intended takeoff direction and  the nosewheel positioned straight down the runway on the  centerline. After releasing the brakes, the throttle should  be advanced smoothly and continuously to takeoff power.  [Figure 7-2]  This can be done with the foot or the hand  cruise throttle.  

![](images/86e1d84e5c4a9b1933b0ab70f446a1be7a4a0305a5ab49789daa12c43ea8f4cd.jpg)  
Figure 7-2.   Lined up in the middle of the runway and ready to apply  full power for takeoff.  

The advantage of using the foot throttle is that the takeoff  can be aborted quickly if required. The disadvantage is that  the foot can slip off or be knocked off during the critical  takeoff phase of ﬂ  ight. The advantage of using the hand cruise  throttle during takeoff is having a solid and set throttle that the  pilot does not have to worry about holding during the takeoff  phase of ﬂ  ight. Students have been known to release the foot  throttle on takeoff, resulting in catastrophic consequences  during the lift-off and initial climb phases of ﬂ  ight. Students  may be encouraged to use the hand throttle by the instructor  or the instructor must be able to immediately apply the hand  or secondary foot throttle if a student lets up on the throttle  during this critical takeoff and climb phase.  

An abrupt application of power may cause the aircraft to  yaw sharply to the left (or right depending on the propeller  rotation) because of the torque effects of the engine and  propeller. This is most apparent in high horsepower engines.  As the aircraft starts to roll forward, the pilot should ensure  that both feet are on the front steering fork and not applying  the brake.  

As speed is gained, the control bar fore and aft pitch tends  to assume a neutral trim position. The wing should be  maintained level side to side with the control bar. At the same  time, directional control should be maintained with smooth,  prompt, positive nosewheel steering throughout the takeoff  roll. The effects of engine torque at the initial speeds tend to  pull the nose to the left (or right depending on the propeller  rotation). The pilot must steer the WSC aircraft straight down  the middle of the runway with the feet. The positioning of the  wing has no effect of steering on the ground. The common  saying among WSC pilots is “you steer with your feet, you  ﬂ  y with your hands.”  

While the speed of the takeoff roll increases, increasingly  more  pressure is felt on the control bar to the ground roll  trim position. Letting the wing pitch pressures determine the  fore and aft control bar position provides the least drag for the  WSC aircraft to accelerate. The pilot maintains directional  control down the center of the runway with the foot steering,  keeps the wings level side to side, and allows the wing to  determine the pitch angle during the acceleration.  

# Lift-Off  

Since a good takeoff depends on the proper takeoff attitude,  it is important to know how this attitude appears and how it  is attained. The ideal takeoff attitude requires only minimum  pitch adjustments shortly after the airplane lifts off to attain  the speed for the best rate of climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  .  [Figure 7-3] The pitch attitude necessary for the aircraft to accelerate  to   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   speed should be demonstrated by the instructor and  memorized by the student. Initially, the student pilot may  have a tendency to hold excessive control bar forward/nose  up pressure just after lift-off, resulting in an abrupt pitch-up.  The ﬂ  ight instructor should be prepared for this. For a normal  takeoff, the WSC aircraft should lift off the ground gradually  and smoothly.  

Each type of WSC aircraft has a best pitch attitude for normal  lift-off; however, varying conditions may make a difference  in the required takeoff technique. A rough ﬁ  eld, a smooth  ﬁ eld, a hard surface runway, or a short or soft, muddy ﬁ eld, calls for a slightly different technique as does smooth air in  contrast to a strong, gusty wind. The different techniques  for those other-than-normal conditions are discussed later  in this chapter.  

As the WSC aircraft accelerates and obtains the speed it  needs to lift off, a slight push forward on the control bar  

![](images/c13f4d7eebbb55fe7ba1afc405f520d524589d89f65206e59e5de16bc06a8179.jpg)  
Figure 7-3.   Initial roll and takeoff attitude.  

provides the initial attitude to lift-off. This is often referred  to as “rotating.” At this point, the climb speed should be  immediately established for the particular condition. For calm  winds, this would be the trim position or the manufacturer  recommended takeoff safety airspeed. The wings must be  kept level by applying side to side pressure as necessary.  

Since some forward pressure was required to rotate, this  pressure must be relaxed smoothly so that takeoff attitude  is not too high. This requires the control bar being brought  back to trim and applying some nose down pressure to avoid  popping off as the WSC aircraft leaves the ground. Each make  and model is different and the high power WSC aircraft must  provide more nose down pressure after rotation to keep the  attitude low. A good takeoff is a smooth and gradual liftoff.  It is important to hold the correct attitude constant after  rotation and liftoff.  

As the aircraft leaves the ground, the pilot must continue to  be concerned with maintaining the wings in a level attitude,  as well as holding the proper pitch attitude. An outside visual  scan to attain/maintain proper pitch and bank attitude must  be intensiﬁ  ed at this critical point.  

During takeoffs in a strong, gusty wind, it is advisable that an  extra margin of speed be obtained before the WSC aircraft is  allowed to leave the ground. A takeoff at the normal takeoff  speed may result in a lack of positive control, or a stall,  when the WSC aircraft encounters a sudden lull in strong,  gusty wind, or other turbulent air currents. In this case, the  pilot should allow the aircraft to stay on the ground longer  by pulling the control bar towards the chest keeping the nose  down to attain more speed; then make a smooth, positive  rotation to leave the ground.  

# Initial Climb  

Upon lift-off, the WSC aircraft should be ﬂ  ying at the  approximate pitch attitude that allows it to accelerate to at  least the manufacturers takeoff safety speed. This is usually  close to the best climb rate speed  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   providing the greatest  altitude gain in a period of time. Higher speeds should be  used if the air is turbulent to assure the WSC does not stall  from a strong wind gust. This speed should be maintained  during the initial climb out in case of an engine failure. This  is especially important with higher power engines and larger  wings to avoid a high pitch attitude during this critical phase  of the takeoff. With a lower pitch attitude and a faster speed,  the WSC aircraft can recover easier from an engine failure on  takeoff. This is discussed in greater detail in the emergency  procedures chapter of this handbook. For example, from  liftoff to 200 feet it is a good practice to keep a low pitch  angle to anticipate an engine failure; above 200 feet,  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   can  be used as a climb speed.  [Figures 7-4 and 7-5]  

After liftoff and throughout the climb, the engine instruments  should be checked for proper cooling and oil pressure (if so  equipped) since this is the critical time when temperature  rises and should stabilize within the manufacturer’s  speciﬁ  cations.  

The manufacturer’s recommended takeoff power should be  maintained until reaching an altitude of at least 500 feet above  the surrounding terrain or obstacles. The combination of   $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  and takeoff power assures the maximum altitude gained in  the time during takeoff. This provides the pilot the greatest  altitude from which the aircraft can be safely maneuvered in  case of an engine failure or other emergency.

Figure 7-5.   Best climb speed control bar position for this WSC is  shown after initial climb where there is sufficient altitude for easy  recovery in case of engine failure.  

Since the power on the initial climb is ﬁ  xed at the takeoff  power setting, the airspeed must be controlled by making  slight pitch adjustments using the control bar. However, the  pilot should not ﬁ  xate on the airspeed indicator when making  these pitch changes, but continue to scan outside to adjust the  attitude in relation to the horizon and the feel of the aircraft.  The WSC aircraft can be ﬂ  own by using bar position and the  feel of the air to determine proper airspeed; it is not necessary  to look at the airspeed indicator to determine exact airspeed.  In accordance with the principles of ﬂ  ying a WSC aircraft,  the pilot should ﬁ  rst make the necessary pitch change with  reference to the bar position, and then glance at the airspeed  indicator as a check to see if the new speed is correct.  

After the recommended climb airspeed has been established  and a safe maneuvering altitude has been reached, the power  should be adjusted to the recommended climb setting (if  different) and the WSC aircraft trimmed (if so equipped) to  relieve the control pressures. This makes it easier to hold a  constant attitude and airspeed.  

During initial climb, it is important that the takeoff path  remain aligned with the runway to avoid drifting into  obstructions or the path of another aircraft that may be taking  off from a parallel runway. Proper scanning techniques are  essential to a safe takeoff and climb, not only for maintaining  attitude and direction, but also for collision avoidance in the  airport area.  [Figure 7-6]

Figure 7-6.   Pilots view showing WSC centered in the middle of the  runway during initial climb.  

When the student pilot nears the solo stage of ﬂ  ight training,  it should be explained that the aircraft’s takeoff performance  is much different when the instructor is out of the aircraft.  Due to decreased load, the WSC aircraft becomes airborne  sooner and climbs more rapidly. The pitch attitude that the  student has learned to associate with initial climb differs  signiﬁ  cantly due to decreased weight. This can be a dramatic  effect since a 250 pound instructor could reduce the total  weight of the WSC aircraft by 30 percent. This gives the  student the sensation of lying on his or her back during initial  takeoff and the reaction is to let off the throttle with serious  consequences if the student is using the foot throttle. It must  be emphasized by the instructor that the student will seem  to be rotated and going straight up, but not to let up on the  throttle. The reaction of the student is to pull in the control  bar to lower the high pitch attitude. This is where the cruise  throttle should be used to eliminate this common problem.  The increase in performance is signiﬁ  cant when the student  ﬁ  rst solos in the same aircraft, which must be explained  and understood. If the situation is unexpected, it may result  in increased tension that may remain throughout the ﬂ  ight.  Frequently, the existence of this tension and the uncertainty  that develops due to the perception of an “abnormal” takeoff  results in poor performance on the subsequent landing.  

Common errors in the performance of normal takeoffs and  departure climbs are:  

•   Failure to adequately clear the area prior to taxiing  into position on the active runway. •   Abrupt use of the throttle. •   Letting off the foot throttle after takeoff. •   Failure to check engine instruments for signs of  malfunction after liftoff and climb. •   Failure to anticipate the aircraft’s left turning tendency  on initial acceleration and takeoff. •   Overcorrecting for left turning tendency. •   Overcorrecting for roll. •   Relying solely on the airspeed indicator rather  than developing a feel for indications of speed and  controllability during acceleration and lift-off. •   Failure to attain proper lift-off attitude. •   Overcontrol of pitch during initial lift-off to  climbout. •   Failure to attain/maintain best rate of climb airspeed   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$  . •   Failure to employ the principles of attitude ﬂ  ying  during climb-out, resulting in “chasing” the airspeed  indicator.  

# Crosswind Takeoff  

While it is usually preferable to take off directly into the  wind whenever possible or practical, there are many instances  when circumstances or judgment indicate otherwise.  Therefore, the pilot must be familiar with the principles and  techniques involved in crosswind takeoffs, as well as those  for normal takeoffs.  

The manufacturers maximum wind and crosswind component  in the POH should not be exceeded. The following procedures  are for operation within these limitations.  

# Takeoff Roll  

The technique used during the initial takeoff roll in a crosswind  is generally the same as used in a normal takeoff, except that  the pilot must control the wing’s tendency to weathervane  into the wind during the takeoff roll. Additionally, the pilot  should keep the WSC aircraft on the ground and accelerate  to a higher speed before rotation.  

As the aircraft is taxied into takeoff position, it is essential that  the windsock and other wind direction indicators be checked  so that the presence of a crosswind may be recognized and  anticipated. During taxi and takeoff, the windward side of  the wing needs to be slightly lowered so as to not let the  wind get under it and lift it off; but not too low or additional  pilot effort is required and unnecessary stress is placed on  the carriage.  

The crosswind takeoff is performed similar to the normal  takeoff except two different techniques are utilized. First, as  the WSC aircraft accelerates and the pilot steers the carriage  straight down the runway, the wing will want to weathervane  into the wind. This creates stress on the wing attachment to  the carriage, the carriage mast, and the keel of the carriage.  Therefore, the pilot must hold the wing control bar straight  to the carriage which requires signiﬁ  cant force and muscle.  Second, the pilot must accelerate to a higher speed before  rotating to account for the crosswind component. This requires  the nose to be held down to prevent the WSC from popping  off the ground before the higher airspeed is obtained.  

Since this technique requires the pilot to muscle the wing  rather than using a light touch, it requires a mastery of  the normal takeoff before crosswind takeoffs should be  attempted. As the WSC aircraft accelerates down the runway,  the forces of the wing try to weathervane it into the wind and  the nose raises up to trim. The wing should be held straight  with the nose down until rotation where the wing is held  straight and the nose raised.  

# Rotation and Lift-Off  

When a faster rotation speed than normal takeoff is achieved,  a smooth but quicker push out to rotate is desired to get  the front and rear wheels into the air quickly, avoiding any  tendency to remain on the rear wheels. After lift-off, the WSC  automatically rotates into the relative wind since momentum  is straight down the runway and the characteristics of the wing  point it directly into the relative wind. The WSC sets up the  wind correction angle (or crab angle as it is also called) as it  lifts off.  [Figure 7-7]  

# Initial Climb  

After lift-off, the WSC aircraft is pointed toward the wind  and the ground track is headed straight down the runway  centerline. Maintain this ground track aligned directly  down the centerline of the runway “crabbing” into the  wind. Crabbing is a term used to adjust ﬂ  ight controls into  the crosswind to maintain a straight ground track while the  WSC is pointed towards the wind, as seen in  Figure 7-8. To maintain the ground track it is important to look straight  down the runway centerline and steer to stay on that ground  track even though the WSC is pointed towards the wind  and not directly down the runway. Because the force of a  crosswind may vary markedly within a few hundred feet of  the ground, frequent checks of actual ground track should be  made  [Figure 7-7]  or the WSC could drift to the side if the  wind correction angle is not maintained. The remainder of

Figure 7-7.   Wing correction angle (or crab angle as is is commonly  called).  

the climb technique is the same used for normal takeoffs and  climbs maintaining the proper ground track with the proper  wing correction angle/crab angle.  [Figure 7-8]  

In addition to normal takeoffs, additional common errors in  the performance of crosswind takeoffs are:  

•   Letting the windward side of the wing get too high. •   Allowing the wing to weathervane into the wind  during the takeoff roll. •   Not obtaining additional speed before rotation. •   Too slow of a rotation during lift-off.  •   Inadequate drift correction after lift-off.  

# Ground Effect on Takeoff  

Ground effect is a condition of improved performance  encountered when the aircraft is operating very close to  the ground. Ground effect can be detected and measured  up to an altitude of about one wingspan above the surface.  [Figure 7-9]  However, ground effect is most signiﬁ  cant when  the WSC aircraft is maintaining a constant attitude at low  airspeed and low altitude. Examples are during takeoff when  the aircraft lifts off and accelerates to climb speed, and also  during the landing ﬂ  are before touchdown. When the wing  is under the inﬂ  uence of ground effect, there is a reduction  in upwash, downwash, and wingtip vortices.  

Since the WSC wing is a high wing aircraft, the effects  are not as pronounced as a low wing airplane, but during  rotation, the reduction in induced drag is about 25 percent  

![](images/dd6109ace63b9d69b7424ade7624c6128648d68226feb7ecefe444fc576f5cf5.jpg)  
Figure 7-8.   Crosswind takeoff.  

and decreases as the WSC aircraft climbs. At high speeds  where parasite drag dominates, induced drag is a small part  of the total drag. Consequently, the effects of ground effect  are of greater concern during takeoff and landing.  

![](images/d0450e421870d069c5a6ac392a0fa630c8eed2292d30c93a7bb537b34cedd964.jpg)  
Figure 7-9.   Ground effect area.  

On takeoff, the takeoff roll, lift-off, and the beginning of the  initial climb are accomplished in the ground effect area. As  the aircraft lifts off and climbs out of the ground effect area  the following occurs.  

•   The WSC aircraft requires an increase in angle of  attack to maintain the same lift coefﬁ  cient. •   The WSC aircraft experiences an increase in induced  drag and thrust required.  

Due to the reduced drag in ground effect, the aircraft may  seem capable of taking off below the recommended airspeed  with less thrust. However, as the aircraft rises out of ground  effect with an insufﬁ  cient airspeed, initial climb performance  may prove to be marginal due to increased drag. Under  conditions of high density altitude, high temperature, and/or  maximum gross weight, the aircraft may become airborne  at an insufﬁ  cient airspeed but unable to climb out of ground  effect. Consequently, the aircraft may not be able to clear  obstructions or may settle back on the runway. The point to  remember is that additional power is required to compensate  for increases in drag that occur as an aircraft leaves ground  effect. But during an initial climb, the engine is already  developing maximum power. The only alternative is to lower  pitch attitude to gain additional airspeed, which results in  inevitable altitude loss. Therefore, under marginal conditions,  it is important that the aircraft take off at the recommended  speed that provides adequate initial climb performance.  

Ground effect is important to normal ﬂ  ight operations. If  the runway is long enough, or if no obstacles exist, ground  effect can be used to advantage by utilizing the reduced drag  to improve initial acceleration. Additionally, the procedure  for takeoff from unsatisfactory surfaces is to take as much  weight on the wings as possible during the ground run, and to  lift off with the aid of ground effect before true ﬂ  ying speed  is attained. It is then necessary to reduce the angle of attack  to attain normal airspeed before attempting to ﬂ  y away from  the ground effect area.  

# Short Field Takeoff and Steepest Angle  Climb  

Takeoffs and climbs from ﬁ  elds in which the takeoff area is  short or the available takeoff area is restricted by obstructions  require the pilot to operate the WSC aircraft at the limit of its  takeoff performance capabilities. To depart from such an area  safely, the pilot must exercise positive and precise control of  attitude and airspeed so that takeoff and climb performance  results in the shortest ground roll and the steepest angle of  climb.  

The achieved result should be consistent with the performance  section of the AFM/POH. In all cases, the power setting,  trim setting, airspeed, and procedures prescribed by the  manufacturer should be followed.  

In order to accomplish a short ﬁ  eld takeoff and steepest angle  climb safely, the pilot must have adequate knowledge in the  use and effectiveness of the best angle-of-climb   $\mathrm{(V_{X})}$   speed  and the best rate-of-climb   $(\mathrm{V_{Y})}$   speed for the speciﬁ  c make  and model of WSC aircraft being ﬂ  own.  

The speed for  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   is that which results in the greatest gain in  altitude for a given distance over the ground.  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   is usually  less than  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   but greater than minimum controlled airspeed. It  should be noted that this maneuver is not performed in normal  situations. Flying at  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   speed close to the ground in gusty  winds can result in a stall with catastrophic consequences.  

If clearing an obstacle is questionable, the WSC aircraft  should be packed up and trailered away. If a pilot decides to  perform a short ﬁ  eld takeoff, then a number of factors can  be optimized to contribute to a short ﬁ  eld takeoff such as  leaving your passenger and/or baggage in the area, waiting  for favorable winds or lower density altitude, and picking the  longest runway path with the shortest obstacle to clear.  

However, if a short ﬁ  eld takeoff is going to be performed  and all possible factors have been optimized, the following  procedure is provided. The procedure is similar to the normal  takeoff but the following additional procedure is used for  this maneuver.  

# Takeoff Roll  

Taking off from a short ﬁ  eld requires the takeoff to be started  from the very beginning of the takeoff area. The WSC  manufacturer’s recommended speciﬁ  c trim setting should be  set before starting the takeoff roll. This permits the pilot to  give full attention to the proper technique and the aircraft’s  performance throughout the takeoff.  

Some authorities prefer to hold the brakes until the maximum  obtainable engine revolutions per minute (rpm) is achieved  before allowing the WSC aircraft to begin its takeoff run.  However, it has not been established that this procedure  results in a shorter takeoff run in all WSC aircraft, many of  which can not hold the brakes at full throttle. If the brakes  are not held with the throttle advanced to full and then  released, takeoff power should be applied immediately to  full throttle as fast as possible without the engine bogging  down to accelerate the aircraft as rapidly as possible. The  WSC aircraft should be allowed to roll with the wing ﬁ  nding  the trim position for minimum drag during acceleration to  the lift-off speed.  

# Lift-Off and Climb Out  

At  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   speed, the WSC aircraft should be smoothly and ﬁ  rmly  rotated by applying control bar forward pressure to an attitude  that results in the  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   airspeed. After becoming airborne, a  wings-level climb should be maintained at  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   until obstacles  have been cleared. Thereafter, the pitch attitude may be  lowered slightly and the climb continued at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   speed until  reaching a safe maneuvering altitude.  

Remember that an attempt to rotate off the ground prematurely  or to climb too steeply may cause the WSC aircraft to settle  back to the runway or into the obstacles. Even if the aircraft  remains airborne, the initial climb remains ﬂ  at and climb  performance/obstacle clearance ability is seriously degraded  until  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   airspeed is achieved.  [Figure 7-10]

Figure 7-10.   Short field takeoff.  

In addition to normal takeoffs, common errors in the  performance of short ﬁ  eld takeoffs are:  

•   Deciding to do a questionable short ﬁ  eld takeoff  when the WSC aircraft can be packed up and driven  away. •   Failure to adequately determine the best path with the  longest run and shortest obstacle. •   Failure to utilize all available runway/takeoff area. •   Failure to wait for the best atmospheric conditions of  density altitude and wind direction. •   Failure to reduce all possible weight from the WSC  aircraft.  •   Failure to have the WSC aircraft properly trimmed  prior to takeoff. •   Premature lift-off resulting in high drag. •   Holding the WSC aircraft on the ground  unnecessarily. •   Inadequate rotation resulting in excessive speed after  lift-off. •   Inability to attain/maintain best  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   airspeed. •   Fixation on the airspeed indicator during initial  climb.  

# Soft/Rough Field Takeoff and Climb  

Takeoffs and climbs from soft ﬁ  elds require the use of  operational techniques for getting the WSC aircraft airborne  as quickly as possible to eliminate the drag caused by tall  grass, soft sand, mud, and snow, and may or may not require  climbing over an obstacle. The technique makes judicious  use of ground effect and requires a feel for the WSC aircraft  and ﬁ  ne control touch. These same techniques are also useful  on a rough ﬁ  eld where it is advisable to get the aircraft off  the ground as soon as possible to avoid damaging the landing  gear.  

Soft surfaces or long, wet grass usually reduce the aircraft’s  acceleration during the takeoff roll so much that adequate  takeoff speed might not be attained if normal takeoff  techniques were employed.  

It should be emphasized that the WSC aircraft is different  from most aircraft. The high wing creates a high center of  gravity in which the front wheel can bog down in soft ﬁ  elds  and ﬂ  ip the WSC aircraft forward. The propeller in the  back pushing down on the front wheel also contributes to  this unique situation. This is a limitation for WSC aircraft  that should not be ignored. WSC aircraft that land in soft  ﬁ  elds or sand may not be able to take off. There is a wide  variation of manufacturer designs with the least preferable  being a skinny, high pressure, highly loaded front tire. WSC  aircraft with large wide tires that can be operated at low  pressure are designed for operation in soft and rough ﬁ  elds.  [Figures 7-11  through  7-13]  

Correct takeoff procedure for soft ﬁ  elds and rough ﬁ  elds is  quite different from that appropriate for short ﬁ  elds with ﬁ  rm,  smooth surfaces. To minimize the hazards associated with  takeoffs from soft or rough ﬁ  elds, support of the aircraft’s  weight must be transferred as rapidly as possible from the  wheels to the wings as the takeoff roll proceeds. Establishing  and maintaining a relatively high angle of attack with a nose- high pitch attitude as early as possible achieves this.

Figure 7-13.   Grass fields are commonly used for WSC operations but require a longer time to accelerate to takeoff speed.  

Stopping on a soft surface, such as mud, snow or sand,  might bog the aircraft down; therefore, it should be kept in  continuous motion with sufﬁ  cient power while lining up for  the takeoff roll.  

# Takeoff Roll  

As the aircraft is aligned with the takeoff path, takeoff power  is applied smoothly and rapidly. As the aircraft accelerates,  the control bar is moved full forward to the front tube to  establish a positive angle of attack and to reduce the weight  supported by the nosewheel because any lift on the wing  takes load off of the landing gear.  

When the aircraft is held at a nose-high attitude throughout  the takeoff run and as speed increases and lift develops, the  wings progressively relieve the wheels of more and more of  the WSC’s weight, thereby minimizing the drag caused by  surface irregularities or adhesion. If this attitude is accurately  maintained, the aircraft virtually ﬂ  ies itself off the ground,  becoming airborne at airspeed slower than a safe climb speed  because of ground effect.  [Figure 7-14]  

# Lift-Off and Initial Climb  

After becoming airborne, the nose should be lowered very  gently with the wheels clear but just above the surface to  allow the aircraft to utilize ground effect to accelerate to  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$  ,  or   $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   if obstacles must be cleared. Extreme care must be  exercised immediately after the aircraft becomes airborne and  while it accelerates to avoid settling back onto the surface.  An attempt to climb prematurely or too steeply may cause the  aircraft to settle back to the surface as a result of losing the  beneﬁ  t of ground effect. An attempt to climb out of ground  effect before sufﬁ  cient climb airspeed is attained may result  in aircraft incapacity to continue climbing as the ground effect  area is traveled, even with full power for lower powered WSC  aircraft. Therefore, it is essential that the aircraft remain in  ground effect until at least  $\mathrm{V_{X}}$   is reached. This requires a feel  for the WSC aircraft and a very ﬁ  ne control touch in order  to avoid overcontrolling the pitch control as required control  pressures change with aircraft acceleration. Simply getting  off the ground as quickly as possible and ﬂ  ying in ground  effect is the goal.  

In addition to normal takeoffs, additional common errors in  the performance of soft/rough ﬁ  eld takeoffs are:  

•   Attempting a takeoff with a WSC that is not equipped  with the proper tires.  •   Minimum air pressure not used in tires. •   Insufﬁ  cient control bar forward pressure during initial  takeoff roll, resulting in inadequate angle of attack. •   Poor directional control. •   Climbing too steeply after lift-off. •   Abrupt and/or excessive pitch control while attempting  to level off and accelerate after lift-off. •   Allowing the aircraft to “mush” or settle resulting in  an inadvertent touchdown after lift-off. •   Attempting to climb out of ground effect area before  attaining sufﬁ  cient climb speed.  

# Rejected Takeoff/Engine Failure  

Emergency or abnormal situations can occur during a takeoff  that requires a pilot to reject the takeoff while still on the  runway. Circumstances such as a malfunctioning powerplant,  items dislodging during takeoff, inadequate acceleration,  runway incursion, or air trafﬁ  c conﬂ  ict may be reasons for  a rejected takeoff.  

![](images/4ac459ff0ddb9f48307b73de46ab2686eb48ac3cc97f7f9fd84b784b7f9d9135.jpg)  
Figure 7-14.   Rough and soft field takeoff.  

Prior to takeoff, the pilot should have in mind a point along  the runway at which the aircraft should be airborne. If  that point is reached and the WSC aircraft is not airborne,  immediate action should be taken to discontinue the takeoff.  Properly planned and executed, chances are excellent the  aircraft can be stopped on the remaining runway without  using extraordinary measures, such as excessive braking  that may result in loss of directional control, damage, and/or  personal injury.  

In the event a takeoff is rejected, the power should be reduced  to idle or the engine shut off and maximum braking applied  while maintaining directional control. If it is necessary to  shut down the engine due to a ﬁ  re, the fuel supply should  be shut off and the magnetos turned off. In all cases, the  manufacturer’s emergency procedure should be followed.  

What characterizes all power loss or engine failure  occurrences after lift-off is urgency. In most instances,  the pilot has only a few seconds after an engine failure to  decide what course of action to take and to execute it. Unless  prepared in advance to make the proper decision, there is an  excellent chance the pilot will make a poor decision, or make  no decision at all and allow events to rule.  

In the event of an engine failure on initial climb-out, the  pilot’s ﬁ  rst responsibility is to maintain aircraft control. At  a climb pitch attitude without power, the WSC is at or near  a stalling angle of attack. It is essential the pilot immediately  lower the pitch attitude by pulling the control bar back  to the chest immediately to prevent a stall. As discussed  earlier in the climb section, a preventative measure is to  climb to a safe altitude, 200 feet was used as an example,  at least the minimum safe climb speed as recommended by  the manufacturer to lower pitch angle as a safety measure  for this situation to minimize a high pitch angle close to the  ground. The pilot should establish a controlled glide toward  a plausible landing area (preferably straight ahead on the  remaining runway).  

# Noise Abatement  

Aircraft noise problems have become a major concern at many  airports throughout the country. Many local communities  have pressured airports into developing speciﬁ  c operational  procedures that help limit aircraft noise while operating  over nearby areas. For years now, the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), airport managers, aircraft operators,  pilots, and special interest groups have been working together  to minimize aircraft noise for nearby sensitive areas. As a  result, noise abatement procedures have been developed for  many of these airports that include standardized proﬁ  les and  procedures to achieve these lower noise goals.  

Airports that have noise abatement procedures provide  information to pilots, operators, air carriers, air traffic  facilities, and other special groups that are applicable to  their airport. These procedures are available to the aviation  community by various means. Most of this information  comes from the Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD), local and  regional publications, printed handouts, operator bulletin  boards, safety brieﬁ  ngs, and local air trafﬁ  c facilities.  

At airports that use noise abatement procedures, reminder  signs may be installed at the taxiway hold positions for  applicable runways. These are to remind pilots to use and  comply with noise abatement procedures on departure. Pilots  who are not familiar with these procedures should ask the  tower or air trafﬁ  c facility for the recommended procedures.  In any case, pilots should be considerate of the surrounding  community while operating their aircraft to and from such  an airport. This includes operating as quietly, yet safely as  possible.  

# Chapter Summary  

Normal Takeoff is straight down runway centerline with  rotation at proper airspeed and initial climb at safe airspeed  and moderate pitch angle to account for engine failure.  Once to safe maneuvering altitude en route climb speed  is maintained. Cross wind takeoffs are similar to normal  takeoffs except wing must be held straight to ground path  during acceleration and greater speed is obtained before  rotation. Short ﬁ  eld takeoffs are performed by ensuring that  sufﬁ  cient runway is available for takeoff and utilizing best- angle-of-climb speed   $\mathrm{(V_{X})}$   until obstacle is cleared. Rough  or soft ﬁ  eld takeoffs are performed by keeping the weight  off the nosewheel, and lifting off into the ground effect to  gain speed as soon as possible.  

Precautions should always be taken by climbing at faster  airspeeds and lower pitch angles in case of an engine failure/ rejected landing.  

# Chapter 8 The National  Airspace System  

# Introduction  

The National Airspace System (NAS) is the network of  all components regarding airspace in the United States.  This comprehensive label includes air navigation facilities,  equipment, services, airports or landing areas, sectional charts,  information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical  information, manpower, and material. Many of these system  components are shared jointly with the military. To conform  to international aviation standards, the United States adopted  the primary elements of the classiﬁ  cation system developed  by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).  This chapter provides a general discussion of airspace  classiﬁ  cation. Detailed information on the classiﬁ  cation of  airspace, operating procedures, and restrictions is found in  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).  

#  

8-1  

This handbook departs from the conventional  norm, in that the airspace discussions are  presented in reverse order, in the belief that it  is much easier to learn the airspace from least  complicated to most complicated; also, the  information presented for basic visual ﬂ  ight  rules (VFR) weather minimums is only that  necessary for weight-shift control (WSC)  aircraft operations.  

The two categories of airspace are regulatory  and nonregulatory. Within these two  categories, there are four types: uncontrolled,  controlled, special use, and other airspace.  

Airspace is charted on sectional charts as  shown in the some examples for the speciﬁ  c  airspaces on the chapter. The specific  airspace symbols are shown on the legend  for each sectional chart.  [Figure 8-1]  The  WSC aircraft pilot should study and refer  to the speciﬁ  cs of the AIM; FAA-H-8083- 25, Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical  Knowledge; and Title 14 of the Code of  Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91 for  additional information regarding airspace  and operations within that airspace.  

# Uncontrolled Airspace  

# Class G Airspace  

Class G or   uncontrolled airspace is the  portion of the airspace that has not been  designated as Class A, B, C, D, or E. Class  G airspace extends from the surface to the  base of controlled airspace (Class B, C, D,  and E) above it as shown in  Figures 8-2 and  8-3.  

Most Class G airspace is overlaid with  Class E airspace, beginning at either 700  or 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL).  In remote areas of the United States, Class  G airspace extends above 700 and 1,200  AGL to as high as 14,500 feet before the  Class E airspace begins.  [Figure 8-2]  The  pilot is advised to consult the appropriate  sectional chart to ensure that he or she is  aware of the airspace limits prior to ﬂ  ight  in an unfamiliar area.  [Figure 8-4]  

There are no communications, entry,  equipment, or minimum pilot certiﬁ  cate

requirements to ﬂ  y in uncontrolled Class G airspace unless  there is a control tower.  [Figure 8-5]  

If operations are conducted at an altitude of  $\leq1{,}200$   feet AGL,  the pilot must remain clear of clouds. If the operations are  conducted more than 1,200 feet AGL but less than 10,000  feet mean sea level (MSL), cloud clearances are 1,000 feet  above, 500 feet below, and 2,000 feet horizontally from any  cloud(s). A popular mnemonic tool used to remember basic  cloud clearances is “C152,” a popular ﬁ  xed-wing training  aircraft. In this case, the mnemonic recalls, “Clouds 1,000,  500, and 2,000.”  

Visibility in Class G airspace below 10,000 MSL day ﬂ  ight  is one statute mile (SM) for private pilots and three SM for  sport pilots. See  Figure 8-6  for speciﬁ  c Class G weather  minimums for WSC pilots.  

# Controlled Airspace  

Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers the different  classiﬁ  cations of airspace and deﬁ  ned dimensions within  which ATC service is provided in accordance with the  airspace classiﬁ  cation. Controlled airspace consists of:  

•  Class E •  Class D •  Class C •  Class B •  Class A  

# Class E Airspace  

Generally, if the airspace is not Class A, B, C, or D, and  is controlled airspace, then it is Class E airspace. Class  E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a  designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled  

![Figure 8-5.  Requirements for airspace operation. ](images/d183b7bb346ffe2f2f6662eb6907a683594cf238d4be1ed7a7c6e9bb51db4fbb.jpg)

airspace.  [Figures 8-3  and  8-7]  Also Class E is federal  airways beginning at 1,200 feet AGL extending 4 nautical  miles (NM) on each side, extending up to 18,000 feet.  

Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace  begins at   $1{,}200\;\mathrm{AGL}$   over the United States, including that  airspace overlying the waters within   $12\:\mathrm{NM}$   of the coast of  the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, and extends up to but  not including 18,000 feet.  

There are no specific communications requirements  associated with Class E airspace  [Figure 8-5];  however, some  Class E airspace locations are designed to provide approaches  for instrument approaches, and a pilot would be prudent to  ensure that appropriate communications are established when  operating near those areas.  

![](images/13efef354c886c11ef40e5cb300f9b0f8a4fa6d5d936fa7d7835d240e32e6fbc.jpg)  
Figure 8-7.   Class E airspace as shown on a sectional chart.  

If WSC aircraft operations are being conducted below 10,000  feet MSL, minimum visibility requirements are three statute  miles and basic VFR cloud clearance requirements are  1,000 feet above, 500 feet below, and 2,000 feet horizontal  (remember the C152 mnemonic). Operations above 10,000  feet MSL for private pilots of WSC aircraft require minimum  visibility of ﬁ  ve statute miles and cloud clearances of at least  1,000 feet above, 1,000 feet below, and one statute mile  horizontally.  [Figure 8-5]  See  Figure 8-6  for speciﬁ  c VFR  visibility requirements.  

# Towered Airport Operations  

All student pilots must have an endorsement to operate within  Class B, C, and D airspace and within airspace for airports  that have a control tower, per 14 CFR section 61.94 or 14 CFR  section 61.95. Only private pilot students can operate within  Class B airspace with the proper endorsements per 14 CFR  section 61.95. Sport pilots must also have an endorsement  per 14 CFR section 61.325 to operate within Class B, C, and  D airspace and within airspace for airports with a control  tower.  [Figure 8-5]  All students and Sport pilots have further  restrictions regarding the speciﬁ  c Class B airports out of  which they may operate, per 14 CFR section 91.131.  

# Class D Airspace  

Class D is that airspace from the surface to 2,500 feet AGL  (but charted in MSL) surrounding smaller airports with  an operational control tower.  [Figures 8-3  and  8-8]  The  conﬁ  guration of each Class D airspace area is individually  tailored. When instrument procedures are published, the  airspace is normally designed to contain the procedures.  

![](images/93b70ce49e1298b9f360f937ba6200de961caaf6344dc7a2901ee81f23859e3a.jpg)  
Figure 8-8.   Class D airspace shown on a sectional chart.  

Unless otherwise authorized, each aircraft must establish two- way radio communications with the ATC facility providing  air trafﬁ  c services prior to entering the airspace and thereafter  maintain those communications while in the airspace. Radio  contact should be initiated far enough from the Class D  airspace boundary to preclude entering the Class D airspace  before two-way radio communications are established. It is  important to understand that if the controller responds to the  initial radio call without using the WSC aircraft’s call sign,  radio communications have not been established, and the  WSC aircraft may not enter the Class D airspace.  

Many airports associated with Class D airspace do not  operate a control tower on a 24-hour-a-day basis. When not  in operation, the airspace will normally revert to Class E or  G airspace, with no communications requirements. Refer to  the AF/D for speciﬁ  c hours of operation airports.  

The minimum visibility requirements for Class D airspace  are three statute miles; cloud clearances are the 1,000 above,  500 below and 2,000 vertical.  [Figure 8-6]  

# Class C Airspace  

Class C airspace normally extends from the surface to 4,000  feet above the airport elevation surrounding those airports  having an operational control tower, that are serviced by a  radar approach control, and with a certain number of IFR  and passenger enplanements (larger airline operations).  [Figures 8-3  and  8-9]  This airspace is charted in feet MSL,  and is generally of a ﬁ  ve NM radius surface area that extends  from the surface to 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, and  a  $10\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   radius area that extends from 1,200 feet to 4,000 feet  above the airport elevation. There is also a noncharted outer  area with a  $20\;\mathrm{{NM}}$   radius, which extends from the surface  to 4,000 feet above the primary airport, and this area may  include one or more satellite airports.  [Figure 8-9]  

![](images/abc0e533773e65f885438a38fe71acc83c538c9e04d68bf88b70f0a6d2e2a17a.jpg)  
Figure 8-9.  Class C airspace as shown on a sectional chart.  

WSC aircraft can ﬂ  y into Class C airspace by contacting  the control tower ﬁ  rst, establishing communications (same  as Class D), and having an altitude encoding transponder.  Aircraft can enter Class C airspace without a transponder if  prior permission from ATC is received 1 hour before entry,  per 14 CFR section 91.215(d)(3). Aircraft may ﬂ  y under the  Class C upper tier of airspace without a transponder but not  over the top of Class C airspace lateral boundaries.  

Cloud clearances in Class C airspace are the same as Class D  airspace: minimum visibility of three statute miles, and a  minimum distance from clouds of 1,000 feet above, 500 feet  below, and 2,000 feet horizontal.  

Since Class C has signiﬁ  cant air trafﬁ  c, many with larger  airplanes creating stronger vortices, the pilot must be aware  that the chance of encountering catastrophic wingtip vortices  is greater at airports with larger air trafﬁ  c.  

# Class B Airspace  

Class B airspace is generally airspace from the surface to  10,000 feet MSL surrounding the nation’s busiest airports  in terms of IFR operations or passenger enplanements.  [Figures 8-3  and  8-10]  The conﬁ  guration of each Class B  airspace area is individually tailored and consists of a surface  area and two or more additional layers (some Class B  airspace areas resemble upside-down wedding cakes), and  is designed to contain all published instrument procedures  once an aircraft enters the airspace.  

![](images/f08adb007f6cde11d869f73af3bb7e5b6bf81173ae19d8873063d72cc7ca609b.jpg)  
Figure 8-10.  Class B airspace as shown on a sectional chart.  

Equipment requirements are the same as for Class C airspace;  however, due to air trafﬁ  c congestion, the WSC aircraft pilot  requesting entry to Class B airspace may be denied entry.  Since aircraft operating in Class B airspace have a radar  signature and ATC provides aircraft separation, there is a  difference in the cloud clearance requirements. Visibility  remains three statute miles, but minimum cloud clearance  requirement is to remain clear of clouds.  [Figure 8-6]  

# Airspace Above 10,000' MSL and Below 18,000'  

For WSC aircraft ﬂ  ying above 10,000 feet MSL, the visibility  must be greater than 5 SM and cloud clearances increase to  1,000 feet below, 1,000 feet above, and 1 SM horizontal.  If the WSC aircraft was not certiﬁ  cated with an electrical  system, an altitude encoding transponder is required per 14  CFR section 91.215.  

Oxygen is required for the pilot above   $12{,}500~\mathrm{MSL}$   up to  and including 14,000 feet MSL if the ﬂ  ight at those levels  is more than 30 minutes duration. At altitudes above 14,000  feet MSL, oxygen is required for the pilot during the entire  ﬂ  ight time at those altitudes. At altitudes above 15,000 feet  MSL, each occupant of the aircraft must be provided with  supplemental oxygen.  

# Class A Airspace  

Class A airspace is generally the airspace from 18,000 feet  MSL up to and including FL 600, including the airspace  overlying the waters within   $12~\mathrm{{NM}}$   of the coast of the 48  contiguous states and Alaska. Unless otherwise authorized,  all operations in Class A airspace are conducted under IFR.  Class A airspace is not applicable to WSC pilots.  

# Special Use Airspace  

Special use airspace is the designation for airspace in which  certain activities must be conﬁ  ned, or where limitations may  be imposed on aircraft operations that are not part of those  activities.  

Special use airspace usually consists of:  

•  Prohibited areas •  Restricted areas •  Warning areas •  Military operation areas (MOAs) •  Alert areas •  Controlled ﬁ  ring areas •  Parachute jump areas  

Except for controlled firing areas, special use airspace  areas are depicted on visual sectional charts.  [Figure 8-11] Controlled ﬁ  ring areas are not charted because their activities  are suspended immediately when spotter aircraft, radar,  or ground lookout positions indicate an aircraft might be  approaching the area. Non participating aircraft are not  required to change their ﬂ  ightpaths. Special use airspace  areas are shown in their entirety (within the limits of the  chart), even when they overlap, adjoin, or when an area is  designated within another area. The areas are identiﬁ  ed by

Prohibited, restricted or warning areas; alert areas; and MOAs  are further deﬁ  ned with tables on sectional charts for their  altitudes, time of use, controlling agency/contact facility and  controlling agency contact frequency.  [Figure 8-12]  

# Prohibited Areas  

Prohibited areas contain airspace of deﬁ  ned dimensions  within which the ﬂ  ight of aircraft is prohibited. Such areas

are established for security or other reasons associated with  the national welfare. These areas are published in the Federal  Register and are depicted on sectional charts. The area is  charted as a “P” followed by a number (e.g., “P-56 A and  B”).  [Figure 8-13]

# Restricted Areas  

Restricted areas are areas where operations are hazardous to  non participating aircraft and contain airspace within which  the ﬂ  ight of aircraft, while not wholly prohibited, is subject  to restrictions. Activities within these areas must be conﬁ  ned  because of their nature, or limitations may be imposed upon  aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities, or  both. Restricted areas denote the existence of unusual, often  invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g., artillery ﬁ  ring, aerial  gunnery, or guided missiles). Penetration of restricted areas  is illegal without authorization from the using or controlling  agency may be extremely hazardous to the aircraft and its  occupants. ATC facilities apply the following procedures:  

1.  If the restricted area is not active and has been released  to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the  ATC facility will allow the aircraft to operate in the  restricted airspace without issuing speciﬁ  c clearance  for it to do so. 2.  If the restricted area is active and has not been released  to the FAA, the ATC facility will issue a clearance  which will ensure the aircraft avoids the restricted  airspace.  

Restricted areas are charted with an “R” followed by a number  (e.g., “R-4803 and R-4810”) and are depicted on the sectional  charts.  [Figure 8-14]  

# Warning Areas  

Warning areas consist of airspace which may contain hazards  to non participating aircraft in international airspace. The  activities may be much the same as those for a restricted  area. Warning areas are established beyond the three mile  limit and are depicted on sectional charts.  

# Military Operations Areas (MOAs)  

MOAs consist of airspace of deﬁ  ned vertical and lateral limits  established for the purpose of separating certain military  training activity from IFR trafﬁ  c. There is no restriction  against a pilot operating VFR in these areas; however, a  pilot should be alert since training activities may include  acrobatic and abrupt maneuvers. MOAs are depicted by  name and with deﬁ  ned boundaries on sectional, VFR terminal  area, and en route low altitude charts and are not numbered  (e.g., “CHURCHILL HIGH MOA,” “CHURCHILL LOW  

![](images/55027cf373ec9358f9e25342d3cebdf99b6d9b47f363bf8f615794cc0f8e6282.jpg)

MOA,” “RANCH HIGH & RANCH MOA” and “RANCH  MOA”).  [Figure 8-14]  MOA is further deﬁ  ned on sectional  charts with times of operation, altitudes affected, and the  controlling agency frequency for the MOA to contact for  current activity.  [Figure 8-15]  

# Alert Areas  

Alert areas are depicted on sectional charts with an “A”  followed by a number (e.g., “A-211” as in  Figure 8-16 ) to  inform non participating pilots of areas that may contain a  high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial  activity. Pilots should be particularly alert when ﬂ  ying in  these areas. All activity within an alert area shall be conducted  in accordance with regulations, without waiver. Pilots of  participating aircraft, as well as pilots transiting the area,  shall be equally responsible for collision avoidance.

Figure 8-16.  Alert area (A-211).  

# Controlled Firing Areas  

Controlled ﬁ  ring areas contain military activities, which,  if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be  hazardous to non participating aircraft. The difference  between controlled ﬁ  ring areas and other special use airspace  is that activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft,  

![](images/97df2e0c99c8c94b83403cdf2ba8ae1645ab5fa6730e6551623106fdd33a6adb.jpg)  

radar, or ground lookout position indicates an aircraft might  be approaching the area.  

# Parachute Jump Areas  

Parachute jump areas are published in the Airport/ Facility  Directory (A/FD). Sites that are used frequently are depicted  on sectional charts. Each pilot should listen to the appropriate  airport radio frequency for parachute operations and be  alert for aircraft which might be conducting parachute  operations.  

# Other Airspace Areas  

Other airspace areas is a general term referring to the majority  of the remaining airspace. It includes:  

•  Airport advisory areas •  Military training routes (MTRs) •  Temporary ﬂ  ight restrictions   (TFRs) •  Terminal Radar Service Areas •  National security areas  

# Local Airport Advisory  

A local airport advisory is an area within 10 statute miles (SM)  of an airport where a control tower is not operating, but where  a ﬂ  ight service station (FSS) is located. At these locations,  the FSS provides advisory service to arriving and departing  aircraft. See AIM section 3-5-1 for more information on using  the local airport ﬂ  ight station services.  

# Military Training Routes (MTRs)  

National security depends largely on the deterrent effect of  our airborne military forces. To be proﬁ  cient, the military  services must train in a wide range of airborne tactics. One  phase of this training involves “low level” combat tactics. The  required maneuvers and high speeds are such that they may  occasionally make the see-and-avoid aspect of VFR ﬂ  ight  more difﬁ  cult without increased vigilance in areas containing  such operations. In an effort to ensure the greatest practical  level of safety for all ﬂ  ight operations, the Military Training  Route (MTR) program was conceived.  

These routes are usually established below 10,000 feet MSL  for operations at speeds in excess of 250 knots. Some route  segments may be deﬁ  ned at higher altitudes for purposes of  route continuity. Routes are identiﬁ  ed as IFR (IR), and VFR  (VR), followed by a number. MTRs with no segment above  1,500 feet AGL are identiﬁ  ed by four numeric characters  (e.g., IR1206, VR1207). MTRs that include one or more  segments above 1,500 feet AGL are identiﬁ  ed by three  numeric characters (e.g., IR206, VR207). IFR Low Altitude  En Route Charts depict all IR routes and all VR routes that  accommodate operations above 1,500 feet AGL. IR routes  are conducted in accordance with IFR regardless of weather  conditions.  

MTRs are usually indicated with a gray line on the sectional  chart. A WSC aircraft pilot ﬂ  ying in the area of VRs or IRs  should question the briefer during the weather brief to ﬁ  nd  out if any of the routes are in use, and a possible time frame  for opening and closing. While it is true that the WSC aircraft  pilot has the right of way, the WSC aircraft will generally  come out worse in a midair conﬂ  ict with a fast-moving  military aircraft. MTRs, such as the example depicted in  Figure 8-17,  are also further deﬁ  ned on sectional charts.

# Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFRs)  

TFRs are put into effect when trafﬁ  c in the airspace would  endanger or hamper air or ground activities in the designated  area. For example, a forest ﬁ  re, chemical accident, ﬂ  ood, or  disaster-relief effort could warrant a TFR, which would be  issued as a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). The NOTAM begins  with the phrase “FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS” followed by the  location, effective time period, area deﬁ  ned in statute miles,  and altitudes affected, which aircraft ﬂ  ying in the area must  avoid. The NOTAM also contains the FAA coordination  facility and telephone number, the reason for the restriction,  and any other information deemed appropriate. The pilot  should check NOTAMs as part of ﬂ  ight planning.  

The reasons for establishing a temporary restriction are to:  

•  Protect persons and property in the air or on the surface  from an existing or imminent hazard; •  Provide a safe environment for the operation of  disaster relief aircraft; •  Prevent unsafe congestion of sightseeing aircraft  above an incident or event, which may generate a high  degree of public interest; •  Protect declared national disasters for humanitarian  reasons;  

•  Protect the President, Vice President, or other public  ﬁ  gures; and •  Provide a safe environment for space agency  operations.  

It is a pilot’s responsibility to be aware of TFRs in his or her  proposed area of ﬂ  ight. One way to check is to visit the FAA  website, www.tfr.faa.gov, and verify that there is not a TFR  in the area. Another resource is to ask the ﬂ  ight briefer at  800-WX-BRIEF during the preﬂ  ight brieﬁ  ng.  

# Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA)  

Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA) are areas where  participating pilots can receive additional radar services. The  purpose of the service is to provide separation between all  IFR operations and participating VFR aircraft.  

The primary airport(s) within the TRSA become(s) Class D  airspace. The remaining portion of the TRSA overlies other  controlled airspace, which is normally Class E airspace  beginning at 700 or 1,200 feet and established to transition to/ from the en route terminal environment. TRSAs are depicted  on VFR sectional charts and terminal area charts with a solid  black line and altitudes for each segment. The Class D portion  is charted with a blue segmented line. Participation in TRSA  services is voluntary; however, pilots operating under VFR  are encouraged to contact the radar approach control and take  advantage of TRSA service. Operations inside the TFR area  must be conducted under the provisions of a waiver. Should  such an operation be contemplated, the WSC aircraft pilot  should consult with the local Flight Service District Ofﬁ  ce  (FSDO) well in advance of the event.  

# National Security Areas (NSAs)  

NSAs consist of airspace with deﬁ  ned vertical and lateral  dimensions established at locations where there is a  requirement for increased security and safety of ground  facilities. Flight in NSAs may be temporarily prohibited  by regulation under the provisions of 14 CFR part 99, and  prohibitions are disseminated via NOTAM.  

# Published VFR Routes  

Published VFR routes are for transitioning around, under, or  through some complex airspace. Terms such as VFR ﬂ  yway,  VFR corridor, Class B airspace, VFR transition route, and  terminal area VFR route have been applied to such routes.  These routes are generally found on VFR terminal area  planning charts.  

# Flight Over Charted U.S. Wildlife Refuges,  Parks, and Forest Service Areas  

The landing of aircraft is prohibited on lands or waters  administered by the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service, or U.S. Forest Service without authorization  from the respective agency. Exceptions include:  

1.  When forced to land due to an emergency beyond the  control of the operator; 2.  At ofﬁ  cially designated landing sites; or 3.  An approved official business of the Federal  Government.  

Pilots are requested to maintain a minimum altitude of  2,000 feet above the surface of the following: national  parks, monuments, seashores, lakeshores, recreation areas,  and scenic riverways administered by the National Park  Service, National Wildlife Refuges, Big Game Refuges,  Game Ranges, and Wildlife Ranges administered by the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service and wilderness and primitive areas  administered by the U.S. Forest Service.  

# WSC Operations  

WSC preﬂ  ight planning should include a review of the  airspace that is ﬂ  own. A local ﬂ  ight may be close to the ﬁ  eld  and include only Class G and Class E airspace. Minimum  visibility and cloud clearance may be the only requirements  to be met. However, a radio to communicate to the airport  trafﬁ  c and an altimeter to ﬂ  y at the proper airport pattern  altitude is recommended.  

If ﬂ  ying to control tower airports or through Class B, C, or  D airspace, determine if the WSC meets all of the equipment  requirements of that airspace.  [Figure   $_{8-5J}$    Also review  qualiﬁ  cations to determine if the minimum pilot requirements  of the airspace are met. If the minimum aircraft and/or pilot  requirements of the airspace are not met, then the preﬂ  ight  planning should include a course around the airspace. Extra  time and fuel is required for the circumnavigation and should  be taken into consideration prior to departure.  

# WSC and Air Trafﬁ  c Control  

In nontowered airspace, airspace separation from other aircraft  is the responsibility of the pilot. Separation from higher speed  trafﬁ  c may require ﬂ  ightpaths different than faster trafﬁ  c.  For ﬂ  ight and communicating with a control tower, the WSC  pilot may be asked to expedite or deviate from a traditional  course. The WSC pilot must work with ATC in advising of  the airspeed and surface wind limitations. Safe operation in  controlled airspace requires that the controller understand  the performance and limits of the WSC aircraft.  

# Navigating the Airspace  

Knowledge of airspace dimensions, requirements to enter  the airspace, and geographical location of the airspace is  the responsibility of all pilots. The current sectional chart  is the primary ofﬁ  cial tool to determine the airspace ﬂ  ying  within or avoiding.  

Pilotage is navigation by reference to landmarks to determine  location and the location of airspace. Pilotage is the best form  of navigation to ensure that you avoid airspace not authorized  to enter. Locating your position on the sectional chart and  locating/identifying the airspace you want to enter/avoid  requires preﬂ  ight planning on the ground and situational  awareness in the air.  

For all ﬂ  ights, pilots must be sure to have enough fuel to  complete the ﬂ  ight. For longer cross-country ﬂ  ights, this  requires the pilot to check winds aloft and calculate the  groundspeed for the planned altitude and forecast wind. The  resultant time to the destination and the fuel consumption  determines the fuel required to make the ﬂ  ight. This preﬂ  ight  planning is especially important for slower WSC aircraft  because increased headwind components provide signiﬁ  cant  time increases to get to fuel stops than faster aircraft.  Although 14 CFR section 91.151 requires airplanes to have  at least 30 minutes of reserve fuel for an intended fuel stop;  this minimum is also recommended for WSC aircraft. The  Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge chapter on  navigation provides procedures in navigation, plotting a  course, determining groundspeed for the predicted wind,  headings and the required fuel for intended legs of the ﬂ  ight.  For any cross-country ﬂ  ight, a ﬂ  ight log should be used and  the planned groundspeed should be compared to the actual  GPS groundspeed measured in ﬂ  ight. If the GPS groundspeed  is lower than the planned groundspeed, the time en route and  the fuel reserves must be evaluated to assure the WSC aircraft  does not run out of fuel during the ﬂ  ight.  

GPS is a very popular form of navigation used by WSC pilots.  The GPS receiver is small, simple to use, and inexpensive  compared to other forms of electronic (radio) navigation.  Simple modes of operation provide actual groundspeed and  time to a waypoint. More sophisticated GPSs have aviation  databases and provide the pilot a considerable amount of  information about airports and airspace. When using GPS  to determine airspace or airport position, boundaries, and/ or information, the aviation database in the GPS may not  exactly match the information as depicted on the sectional  chart. If there is a difference between the sectional chart and  GPS information, the sectional chart should be considered  correct.  

A WSC pilot using GPS should ensure that the batteries  are fresh and the aviation database is current. Never rely on  the GPS as a primary navigation system. Pilotage using the  sectional chart is the primary navigation system when ﬂ  ying  beyond visual range of a familiar airport. The GPS is used  only as a backup aid for navigation.  

With proper preﬂ  ight planning and constant evaluation of  the planned verses actual ﬂ  ight performance, cross-country  ﬂ  ight is practical in the NAS for WSC pilots.  

# Chapter Summary  

At ﬁ  rst glance, the NAS appears to be a complex arena  in which to operate such a simple aircraft. This chapter  simpliﬁ  es the airspace for the reader, and makes it readily  apparent that it is possible to operate a WSC aircraft safely,  without causing conﬂ  ict.  

Simple courtesy and common sense go a long way in airspace  operations. A complete and thorough understanding of the  airspace, combined with good decision-making, will allow  the pilot to do what he or she wishes, with recognition of the  needs of other users of the sky.  

# Ground Reference  Maneuvers  

# Introduction  

Ground reference maneuvers and their related factors are  used in developing a high degree of pilot skill. Although  most of these maneuvers are not performed in normal  everyday ﬂ  ying, the elements and principles involved are  applicable to performance of the customary pilot operations.  The maneuvers aid the pilot in analyzing the effect of wind  and other forces acting on the aircraft and in developing  a fine control touch, coordination, and the division of  attention necessary for accurate and safe maneuvering of  the aircraft.  

The early part of a pilot’s training is conducted at relatively  high altitudes for the purpose of developing technique,  knowledge of maneuvers, coordination, feel, and the handling  of the aircraft in general. This training requires that most of  the pilot’s attention be given to the actual handling of the  aircraft, the results of control pressures on the action, and  attitude of the aircraft.  

As soon as the pilot shows proﬁ  ciency in the fundamental  maneuvers, it is necessary that he or she be introduced to  ground reference maneuvers requiring attention beyond  practical application and current knowledge base.  

It should be stressed that during ground reference maneuvers,  it is equally important that previously learned basic ﬂ  ying  technique be maintained. The ﬂ  ight instructor should not allow  any relaxation of the student’s previous standard of technique  simply because a new factor is added. This requirement  should be maintained throughout the student’s progress from  maneuver to maneuver. Each new maneuver should embody  some advanced knowledge and include principles of the  preceding maneuver in order to maintain continuity. Each  new skill introduced should build on one already learned so  that orderly, consistent progress can be made.  

# Maneuvering by Reference to Ground  Objects  

Ground track or ground reference maneuvers are performed at  relatively low altitudes while applying wind drift correction  as needed to follow a predetermined track or path over the  ground. These maneuvers are designed to develop the ability  to control the aircraft and to recognize and correct for the  effect of wind, while dividing attention among other matters.  This requires planning ahead of the aircraft, maintaining  orientation in relation to ground objects, ﬂ  ying appropriate  headings to follow a desired ground track, and being  cognizant of other air trafﬁ  c in the immediate vicinity.  

Ground reference maneuvers should be ﬂ  own at an altitude of  approximately 500 to 1,000 feet above ground level (AGL).  The actual altitude will depend on the ability to reach a safe  landing area if there is an engine failure during the maneuver  and the type of air in which the maneuvers are being ﬂ  own.  If there is signiﬁ  cant vertical movement of the air, higher  altitudes should be used to avoid the possibility of ﬂ  ying  below 400 feet AGL, the minimum altitude recommended  in the Practical Test Standards (PTS).  

Overall, the following factors should be considered in  determining the appropriate altitudes for ground reference  maneuvers:  

•   The speed with relation to the ground should not be  so apparent that events happen too rapidly.  

•   The radius of the turn and the path of the aircraft over  the ground should be easily noted and changes planned  and effected as circumstances require. •   Drift should be easily discernable but should not  overtax the student in making corrections. •   Objects on the ground should appear in their proportion  and size. •   The altitude should be low enough to render any gain  or loss apparent to the student, but not recommended  lower than 400 feet above the highest obstruction  and in no case lower than 500 feet above any person,  vessel, vehicle, or structure.  

During these maneuvers, both the instructor and the student  should be alert for available forced-landing ﬁ  elds. The  area chosen should be away from communities, livestock,  or groups of people to prevent becoming an annoyance or  hazard. Due to the altitudes at which these maneuvers are  performed, there is little time available to search for a suitable  ﬁ  eld for landing in the event the need arises.  

# Drift and Ground Track Control  

Whenever an object is free from the ground, it is affected  by the medium surrounding it. This means that a free object  moves in whatever direction and speed that the medium  moves.  

For example, if a powerboat were crossing a still river, the  boat could head directly to a point on the opposite shore  and travel on a straight course to that point without drifting.  However, if the river were ﬂ  owing swiftly, the water current  would require consideration. That is, as the boat progresses  forward on its own power, it must also move upstream at  the same rate the river is moving it downstream. This is  accomplished by angling the boat upstream sufﬁ  ciently to  counteract the downstream ﬂ  ow. If this is done, the boat  follows the desired track across the river from the departure  point directly to the intended destination point. If the boat  is not headed sufﬁ  ciently upstream, it would drift with the  current and run aground at some point downstream on the  opposite bank.  [Figure 9-1]  

As soon as an aircraft becomes airborne, it is free of ground  friction. Its path is then affected by the air mass in which it is  ﬂ  ying; therefore, the aircraft (like the boat) does not always  track along the ground in the exact direction that it is headed.  When ﬂ  ying with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft aligned  with a road, it may be noted that the aircraft gets closer to or  farther from the road without any turn having been initiated  by the pilot. This would indicate that the air mass is moving  sideward in relation to the aircraft. Since the aircraft is ﬂ  ying  

![](images/c7b750dbdb5159222aad2ae79d10906e4cbb0b6a23d65145c1cbdc54b567273f.jpg)  
Figure 9-1.  Wind drift and wind correction angle (crab angle).  

within this moving body of air (wind), it moves or drifts with  the air in the same direction and speed, just like the boat  moved with the river current.  

When ﬂ  ying straight and level and following a selected ground  track, the preferred method of correcting for wind drift is to  head the aircraft (wind correction angle) sufﬁ  ciently into the  wind to cause the aircraft to move forward into the wind at the  same rate the wind is moving it sideways. Depending on the  wind velocity, this may require a large wind correction angle  or one of only a few degrees. This wind correction angle is also  commonly known as the crab angle. When the drift has been  neutralized, the aircraft follows the desired ground track.  

To understand the need for drift correction during ﬂ  ight,  consider a ﬂ  ight with a wind velocity of 20 knots from the  left and   $90^{\circ}$   to the direction the aircraft is headed. After  1 hour, the body of air in which the aircraft is ﬂ  ying has  moved 20 nautical miles (NM) to the right. Since the aircraft  is moving with this body of air, it too has drifted  $20\,\mathrm{{NM}}$   to  the right. In relation to the air, the aircraft moved forward;  but in relation to the ground, it moved forward as well as 20  NM to the right.  

There are times when the pilot needs to correct for drift  while in a turn.  [Figure 9-2]  Throughout the turn, the wind  is acting on the aircraft from constantly changing angles. The  relative wind angle and speed govern the time it takes for the  aircraft to progress through any part of a turn. This is due to  the constantly changing groundspeed. When the aircraft is  headed into the wind, the groundspeed is decreased; when  headed downwind, the groundspeed is increased. Through  the crosswind portion of a turn, the aircraft must be turned  sufﬁ  ciently into the wind to counteract drift.  

To follow a desired circular ground track, the wind correction  angle must be varied in a timely manner because of the  varying groundspeed as the turn progresses. The faster the  groundspeed, the faster the wind correction angle must be  established; the slower the groundspeed, the slower the wind  correction angle may be established. It can be seen then that  the steepest bank and fastest rate of turn should be made on  the downwind portion of the turn and the shallowest bank  and slowest rate of turn on the upwind portion.  

The principles and techniques of varying the angle of bank  to change the rate of turn and wind correction angle for  controlling wind drift during a turn are the same for all ground  track maneuvers involving changes in direction of ﬂ  ight.  

When there is no wind, it should be simple to ﬂ  y along a  ground track with an arc of exactly   $180^{\circ}$   and a constant  radius because the ﬂ  ightpath and ground track would be  identical. This can be demonstrated by approaching a road  at a  $90^{\circ}$   angle and, when directly over the road, rolling into  a medium-banked turn. Then, maintaining the same angle of  bank throughout the   $180^{\circ}$   of turn.  [Figure 9-2]  

To complete the turn, the rollout should be started at a point  where the wings become level as the aircraft again reaches  the road at a  $90^{\circ}$   angle and is directly over the road just as the  

![](images/ade2c74c04db086c20b4bfe4c6cbaeed7874f93d8abd30dbd9e58214413da3d9.jpg)  
Figure 9-2.  Effect of wind during a turn.  

turn is completed. This would be possible only if there were  absolutely no wind and if the angle of bank and the rate of  turn remained constant throughout the entire maneuver.  

If the turn were made with a constant angle of bank and a wind  blowing directly across the road, it would result in a constant  radius turn through the air. However, the wind effects would  cause the ground track to be distorted from a constant radius  turn or semicircular path. The greater the wind velocity, the  greater the difference between the desired ground track and  the ﬂ  ightpath. To counteract this drift, the ﬂ  ightpath can be  controlled by the pilot in such a manner as to neutralize the  effect of the wind and cause the ground track to be a constant  radius semicircle.  

The effects of wind during turns can be demonstrated after  selecting a road, railroad, or other ground reference that forms  a straight line parallel to the wind. Fly into the wind directly  over and along the line and then make a turn with a constant  medium angle of bank for   $360^{\circ}$   of turn.  [Figure 9-3]  The  aircraft returns to a point directly over the line but slightly  downwind from the starting point, the amount depending on  the wind velocity and the time required to complete the turn.  The path over the ground is an elongated circle, although in  reference to the air it is a perfect circle. Straight ﬂ  ight during  the upwind segment after completion of the turn is necessary  to bring the aircraft back to the starting position.  

A similar  $360^{\circ}$   turn may be started at a speciﬁ  c point over the  reference line, with the aircraft headed directly downwind.  In this demonstration, the effect of wind during the constant  banked turn drifts the aircraft to a point where the line is  re-intercepted, but the   $360^{\circ}$   turn is completed at a point  downwind from the starting point.  

Another reference line which lies directly crosswind may be  selected and the same procedure repeated. If wind drift is not  corrected, the aircraft is headed in the original direction at  the completion of the  $360^{\circ}$   turn, but has drifted away from  the line a distance dependent on the amount of wind.  

From these demonstrations, it can be seen where and why  it is necessary to increase or decrease the angle of bank and  the rate of turn to achieve a desired track over the ground.  The principles and techniques involved can be practiced and  evaluated by the performance of the ground track maneuvers  discussed in this chapter.  

# Rectangular Course  

Normally, the ﬁ  rst ground reference maneuver introduced  to the pilot is the rectangular course. Reference  Figure 9-4 throughout this rectangular course section. The rectangular  course is a training maneuver in which the ground track  of the aircraft is equidistant from all sides of a selected  rectangular area on the ground. The maneuver simulates the  conditions encountered in an airport trafﬁ  c pattern. While  performing the maneuver, the altitude and airspeed should  be held constant.  

The maneuver assists the student pilot in perfecting: •   Practical application of the turn.  

![](images/8323f8d257b1cb8b31c6ca0033b251fe55b6242bd05c8f6aeae79b585644642d.jpg)

Figure 9-4.  Rectangular course.  

•   Division of attention between the ﬂ  ightpath, ground  objects, and the handling of the aircraft. •   Timing of the start of a turn so that the turn is fully  established at a deﬁ  nite point over the ground. •   Timing of the recovery from a turn so that a deﬁ  nite  ground track is maintained. •   Establishing a ground track and determining the  appropriate “crab” angle.  

As for other ground track maneuvers, one of the objectives  is to develop division of attention between the ﬂ  ightpath  and ground references while controlling the aircraft and  watching for other aircraft in the vicinity. Another objective  is to develop recognition of drift toward or away from a  line parallel to the intended ground track. This is helpful in  recognizing drift toward or away from an airport runway  during the various legs of the airport trafﬁ  c pattern.  

For this maneuver, a square or rectangular ﬁ  eld (bound on  four sides by section lines or roads that are approximately  one-half mile in length) should be selected away from other  air trafﬁ  c. The aircraft should be ﬂ  own parallel to and at a  uniform distance just to the outside of the ﬁ  eld boundaries,  not quite above the boundaries so that the ﬂ  ightpath may be  easily observed from either seat by looking out the side of  the aircraft. The closer the track of the aircraft is to the ﬁ  eld  boundaries, the steeper the bank necessary at the turning  points. The distance of the ground track from the edges of  the ﬁ  eld should be the same regardless of whether the course  is ﬂ  own to the left or right. Turns should be started when  the aircraft is abeam the corner of the ﬁ  eld boundaries, and  the bank normally should not exceed  $45^{\circ}$  . These should be  the determining factors in establishing the distance from the  boundaries for performing the maneuver.  

Although the rectangular course may be entered from any  direction, this discussion assumes entry on a downwind.  On the downwind leg, the wind is a tailwind and results in  increased groundspeed. Consequently, the turn onto the next  leg is entered with a fairly fast rate of roll-in with relatively  steep bank. As the turn progresses, the bank angle is reduced  gradually because the tailwind component is diminishing,  resulting in a decreasing groundspeed.  

During and after the turn onto this leg (the equivalent of the  base leg in a trafﬁ  c pattern), the wind tends to drift the aircraft  away from the ﬁ  eld boundary. To compensate for the drift,  the amount of turn is more than  $90^{\circ}$  .  

The rollout from this turn must be such that as the wings  become level, the aircraft is turned slightly toward the ﬁ  eld  and into the wind to correct for drift. The aircraft should  again be the same distance from the ﬁ  eld boundary and at  the same altitude as on other legs. The base leg should be  continued until the upwind leg boundary is being approached.  Once more, the pilot should anticipate drift and turning  radius. Since drift correction was held on the base leg, it is  necessary to turn less than   $90^{\circ}$   to align the aircraft parallel  to the upwind leg boundary. This turn should be started with  a medium bank angle with a gradual reduction to a shallow  bank as the turn progresses. The rollout should be timed  to assure paralleling the boundary of the ﬁ  eld as the wings  become level.  [Figure 9-5]  

While the aircraft is on the upwind leg, the next ﬁ  eld boundary  should be observed as it is being approached to plan the turn  onto the crosswind leg. Since the wind is a headwind on this  leg, it reduces the aircraft’s groundspeed and tries to drift the  aircraft toward the ﬁ  eld during the turn onto the crosswind  leg. For this reason, the roll-in to the turn must be slow and  the bank relatively shallow to counteract this effect. As the  turn progresses, the headwind component decreases, allowing  the groundspeed to increase. Consequently, the bank angle  and rate of turn are increased gradually to assure that upon  completion of the turn, the crosswind ground track continues  the same distance from the edge of the ﬁ  eld. Completion of  the turn with the wings level should be accomplished at a  point aligned with the upwind corner of the ﬁ  eld.  

As the wings are rolled level, the proper drift correction  is established with the aircraft turned into the wind with a  change in heading of less than  $90^{\circ}$  . If the turn has been made  properly, the ﬁ  eld boundary will again be the same distance  as it was in the previous legs. While on the crosswind leg,  the wind correction angle should be adjusted as necessary to  maintain a uniform distance from the ﬁ  eld boundary.  

As the next ﬁ  eld boundary is being approached, the pilot  should plan the turn onto the downwind leg. Since a wind  correction angle is being held into the wind and away from the  ﬁ  eld while on the crosswind leg, this next turn requires a turn  of more than   $90^{\circ}$  . Since the crosswind becomes a tailwind,  causing the groundspeed to increase during this turn, the bank  initially should be medium and progressively increased as  the turn proceeds. To complete the turn, the rollout must be  timed so that the wings become level at a point aligned with  the crosswind corner of the ﬁ  eld just as the longitudinal axis  of the aircraft again becomes parallel to the ﬁ  eld boundary.  The distance from the ﬁ  eld boundary should be the same as  from the other sides of the ﬁ  eld.  

Usually, drift should not be encountered on the upwind or the  downwind leg, but it may be difﬁ  cult to ﬁ  nd a situation where  the wind is blowing exactly parallel to the ﬁ  eld boundaries.  This would make it necessary to use a slight wind correction

angle on all the legs. It is important to anticipate the turns  to correct for groundspeed, drift, and turning radius. When  the wind is behind the aircraft, the turn must be faster and  steeper; when it is ahead of the aircraft, the turn must be  slower and shallower. These same techniques apply while  ﬂ  ying in airport trafﬁ  c patterns.  

Common errors in the performance of rectangular courses  are:  

•   Failure to adequately clear the area. •   Failure to establish proper altitude prior to entry  (typically entering the maneuver while descending). •   Failure to establish appropriate wind correction angle,  resulting in drift. •   Gaining or losing altitude. •   Poor coordination (typically gaining or losing airspeed  during the turns). •   Abrupt control usage. •   Inability to divide attention adequately between  aircraft control and maintaining ground track. •   Improper timing in beginning and recovering from  turns.  

•   Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft.  

# S-Turns Across a Road  

An S-turn across a road is a practice maneuver in which the  aircraft’s ground track describes semicircles of equal radii on  each side of a selected straight line on the ground. Reference  Figure 9-6  throughout this S-turn across the road section.   The  straight line may be a road, fence, railroad, or section line  that lies perpendicular to the wind and should be of sufﬁ  cient  length for making a series of turns. A constant altitude should  be maintained throughout the maneuver.  

S-turns across a road present one of the most elementary  problems in the practical application of the turn and in the  correction for wind drift in turns. While the application of this  maneuver is considerably less advanced in some respects than  the rectangular course, it is taught after the student has been  introduced to that maneuver in order that the student may  have a knowledge of the correction for wind drift in straight  ﬂ  ight along a reference line before the student attempts to  correct for drift by playing a turn.  

![](images/e9bb294d2aadee703771c8aa5ed6f388842a43e223a39b5115919177da680cf0.jpg)  
Figure 9-6.  S-Turn.  

The objectives of S-turns across a road are to develop  the ability to compensate for drift during turns, orient the  ﬂ  ightpath with ground references, follow an assigned ground  track, arrive at speciﬁ  ed points on assigned headings, and  divide the pilot’s attention. The maneuver consists of crossing  the road at a  $90^{\circ}$   angle and immediately beginning a series  of   $180^{\circ}$   turns of uniform radius in opposite directions,  re-crossing the road at a   $90^{\circ}$   angle just as each   $180^{\circ}$   turn  is completed. The maneuver can be started with either a  left hand turn or a right hand turn to go in either direction.  Figure 9-6  starts the turn in a left hand turn as an example.  

Accomplishing a constant radius ground track requires  a changing roll rate and angle of bank to establish the  wind correction angle. Both increase or decrease as the  groundspeed increases or decreases.  

The bank must be steepest when beginning the turn on the  downwind side of the road and must be shallowed gradually  as the turn progresses from a downwind heading to an upwind  heading. On the upwind side, the turn should be started with  a relatively shallow bank and then gradually steepened as  the aircraft turns from an upwind heading to a downwind  heading. In this maneuver, the aircraft should be rolled from  one bank directly into the opposite just as the  $90^{\circ}$   reference  line on the ground is crossed.  

Before starting the maneuver, a straight ground reference  line or road that lies   $90^{\circ}$   to the direction of the wind  should be selected, then the area checked to ensure that no  obstructions or other aircraft are in the immediate vicinity.  

The road should be approached from the upwind side at the  selected altitude on a downwind heading. When directly  over the road, the ﬁ  rst turn should be started immediately.  [Figure 9-6, position 1  and  Figure 9-7]  With the aircraft  headed downwind, the groundspeed is greatest and the rate  of departure from the road is rapid; the roll into the steep  bank must be fairly rapid to attain the proper wind correction  angle.  [Figure 9-6, position 2]  This prevents the aircraft from  ﬂ  ying too far from the road and from establishing a ground  track of excessive radius.  

![](images/9f9a5c7eae90664421124136f566ba677e3bfb275d52f35304d516e01c53e4a5.jpg)  
Figure 9-7.   Pilot’s view of crossing a reference line (road) at  $90^{\circ}$  wings level starting the S-turn maneuver.  

During the latter portion of the ﬁ  rst   $90^{\circ}$   turn, when the  aircraft’s heading is changing from a downwind heading  to a crosswind heading, the groundspeed becomes  less and the rate of departure from the road decreases.  

[Figure 9-6, position 2 to 3,  and  Figure 9-8]  The wind  correction angle is at the maximum when the aircraft is  headed directly crosswind.  [Figure 9-6, position 3]  

![](images/3399f1da184a0ab8da9a7d1ca7d25f535f531501abc25bc557a5e64434887e6a.jpg)  
Figure 9-8.   Pilot’s view in starting semicircle turning left from  downwind to crosswind.  

After turning   $90°$  , the aircraft’s heading becomes more  and more an upwind heading, the groundspeed decreases,  and the rate of closure with the road becomes slower.  If a constant steep bank were maintained, the aircraft  would turn too quickly for the slower rate of closure and  would prematurely be headed perpendicular to the road.  Because of the decreasing groundspeed and rate of closure  while approaching the upwind heading, it is necessary to  gradually shallow the bank during the remaining   $90^{\circ}$   of the  semicircle, so that the wind correction angle is removed  completely  [Figure 9-9]  and the wings become level as the   $180^{\circ}$   turn is completed at the moment the road is reached.  [Figure 9-6, position 4]  

![](images/8e14e276d76298221cfca9046b265333a03fb34df15949f49f646b8a2c1bc82d.jpg)  
Figure 9-9.   Student completing semicircle, preparing to level out  to cross perpendicular to the road.  

At the instant the road is being crossed at  $90^{\circ}$   to it, a turn in  the opposite direction should be started. Since the aircraft is  still ﬂ  ying into the headwind, the groundspeed is relatively  low. Therefore, the turn must be started with a shallow bank  to avoid an excessive rate of turn that would establish the  maximum wind correction angle too soon. The degree of bank  should be that which is necessary to attain the proper wind  correction angle so the ground track describes an arc the same  size as the one established on the downwind side.  

Since the aircraft is turning from an upwind to a downwind  heading, the groundspeed increases and after turning   $90^{\circ}$   the rate of closure with the road increases rapidly.  [Figure 9-6, position   $5J$   Consequently, the angle of bank  and rate of turn must be progressively increased so that  the aircraft has turned   $180^{\circ}$   at the time it reaches the road.  Again, the rollout must be timed so the aircraft is in straight- and-level ﬂ  ight directly over and perpendicular to the road.  [Figure 9-6, position 6]  

Throughout the maneuver a constant altitude and airspeed  should be maintained, and the bank should be changing  constantly to effect a true semicircular ground track.  

Common errors in the performance of S-turns across a road  are:  

•   Failure to adequately clear the area. •   Creating too small of a radius/too high of a banked  turn during the start of the maneuver. •  Creating banked turns too high to complete the  maneuver. •   Poor coordination creating variations in airspeeds. •   Gaining or losing altitude. •   Inability to visualize the half circle ground track. •   Poor timing in beginning and recovering from turns. •   Faulty correction for drift. •   Inadequate visual lookout for other aircraft. •  Inability to judge closure rates to the road and adjust  the bank angle so the semi-circle is completed at  $90^{\circ}$    to the reference road.  

# Turns Around a Point  

Turns around a point, as a training maneuver, is a logical  extension of the principles involved in the performance of  S-turns across a road. The objectives are to:  

•   Further perfect turning technique. •   Perfect the ability to control the aircraft subconsciously  while dividing attention between the ﬂ  ightpath and  ground references.  

•   Teach the student that the radius of a turn is a distance  that is affected by the degree of bank used when  turning with relation to a deﬁ  nite object.  

•   Develop a keen perception of altitude.  

•   Perfect the ability to correct for wind drift while in  turns.  

In turns around a point, the aircraft is ﬂ  own in two or  more complete circles of uniform radii or distance from a  prominent ground reference point using a maximum bank of  approximately   $45^{\circ}$   while maintaining a constant altitude.  

The factors and principles of drift correction that are involved  in S-turns are also applicable in this maneuver. As in other  ground track maneuvers, a constant radius around a point  requires a constantly changing angle of bank and angles of  wind correction if any wind exists. The closer the aircraft is to  a direct downwind heading where the groundspeed is greatest,  the steeper the bank and the faster the rate of turn required to  establish the proper wind correction angle. The more nearly it  is to a direct upwind heading where the groundspeed is least,  the shallower the bank and the slower the rate of turn required  to establish the proper wind correction angle. Throughout the  maneuver, the bank and rate of turn must be varied gradually  in proportion to the groundspeed.  

The point selected for turns around a point should be prominent,  easily distinguished by the pilot, and yet small enough to  present precise reference.  [Figures 9-10  through  9-12] Isolated trees, crossroads, or other similar small landmarks  are usually suitable. Right and left hand turns about a point  should be practiced to develop technique in both directions.  The example used here is right hand turns.  

To enter turns around a point, the aircraft should be ﬂ  own  on a downwind heading to one side of the selected point  at a distance equal to the desired radius of turn. When any  signiﬁ  cant wind exists, it will be necessary to roll into the  initial bank at a rapid rate so that the steepest bank is attained  abeam of the point when the aircraft is headed directly  downwind. By entering the maneuver while heading directly  downwind, the steepest bank can be attained immediately.  Thus, if a maximum bank of   $45^{\circ}$   is desired, the initial bank  is  $45^{\circ}$   if the aircraft is at the correct distance from the point.  Thereafter, the bank is shallowed gradually until the point is  reached at which the aircraft is headed directly upwind. At  this point, the bank should be gradually steepened until the  steepest bank is again attained when heading downwind at  the initial point of entry.  

Just as S-turns require that the aircraft be turned into the wind  in addition to varying the bank, so do turns around a point.  During the downwind half of the circle, the aircraft’s nose is  progressively turned toward the inside of the circle; during  the upwind half, the nose is progressively turned toward the  outside. The downwind half of the turn around the point may  be compared to the downwind side of the S-turn across a road;  the upwind half of the turn around a point may be compared  to the upwind side of the S-turn across a road.

Figure 9-12.   Upwind portion of the turn about a point. Notice the wing is higher because bank angle is not at as steep during the upwind  portion headed into the wind to maintain a constant radius circle.  

As the pilot becomes experienced in performing turns  around a point and has a good understanding of the effects  of wind drift and varying the bank angle and wind correction  angle as required, entry into the maneuver may be from any  point. When entering the maneuver at a point other than  downwind, however, the radius of the turn should be carefully  selected. Be sure to take into account the wind velocity and  groundspeed so that an excessive bank is not required later  on to maintain the proper ground track. The ﬂ  ight instructor  should place particular emphasis on the effect of an incorrect  initial bank.  

Common errors in the performance of turns around a point  are:  

# Chapter Summary

 •   Failure to recognize wind drift.

 •   Inadequate bank angle and/or inadequate wind  correction angle on the downwind portion of the circle,  resulting in drift away from the reference point.

 •   Excessive bank and/or inadequate wind correction  angle on the upwind side of the circle, resulting in  drift towards the reference point.

 •   Gaining or losing altitude.

 •  Inability to maintain a constant airspeed.

 •   Inability to direct attention outside the aircraft while  maintaining precise aircraft control.  

# Airport Trafﬁ  c Patterns  

# Introduction  

Just as roads and streets are needed in order to facilitate  automobile trafﬁ  c, airports are needed to facilitate aircraft  trafﬁ  c. Every ﬂ  ight begins and ends at an airport. An airport,  as deﬁ  ned by Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR) section 1.1, is an area of land or water that is  used or intended to be used for the landing and takeoff of  aircraft. For this reason, it is essential pilots learn the trafﬁ  c  rules, procedures, and patterns that may be in use at various  airports.  

When an automobile is driven on congested city streets, it  can be brought to a stop to give way to conﬂ  icting trafﬁ  c;  however, an aircraft can only be slowed down. Consequently,  speciﬁ  c trafﬁ  c patterns and trafﬁ  c control procedures have  been established at designated airports. Trafﬁ  c patterns  provide speciﬁ  c routes for takeoffs, departures, arrivals,  and landings. The exact nature of each airport traffic  pattern is dependent on the runway in use, wind conditions,  obstructions, and other factors.  

# Airport Operations  

Airports vary in complexity from small grass or sod  strips to major terminals having multiple paved runways  and taxiways. Regardless of the type of airport, the pilot  must know and abide by the rules and general operating  procedures applicable to the airport being used. These rules  and procedures are based not only on logic or common sense  but also on courtesy, and their objective is to keep air trafﬁ  c  moving with maximum safety and efﬁ  ciency. The use of  any trafﬁ  c pattern, service, or procedure does not alter the  responsibility of pilots to see and avoid other aircraft.  

Generally, there are two types of airport operations:  

•  Uncontrolled airports where there is no control  tower  •  Controlled airports where there is a control tower with  an air trafﬁ  c controller  

Airport operations is a prerequisite for reading and  understanding this chapter. The Pilot’s Handbook of  Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25) chapter on  airport operations is the starting point for this subject.  Additionally, the portions of the Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM) covering aeronautical lighting and other  airport visual aids, airspace, and air trafﬁ  c control, should  be studied prior to reading this chapter.  

The following airport patterns are applicable to both towered  and nontowered airport operations; however, in nontowered  airports the pilot should use the information presented in this  chapter along with the references provided in the summary to  coordinate with the other air trafﬁ  c. When ﬂ  ying at towered  airports, the principles must be understood to understand  the air trafﬁ  c controller’s instructions. The pilot is always  responsible for “see and avoid” and must continually look  for other aircraft in towered and nontowered operations.  

# Standard Airport Trafﬁ  c Patterns  

To assure that air trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ows into and out of an airport in  an orderly manner, an airport trafﬁ  c pattern is established  appropriate to the local conditions, including the direction  and placement of the pattern, altitude to be ﬂ  own, and  procedures for entering and leaving the pattern. Unless the  airport displays approved visual markings indicating that  turns should be made to the right, pilots should make all  turns in the pattern to the left.  

When operating at an airport with an operating control tower,  the pilot receives by radio a clearance to approach or depart,  as well as pertinent information about the trafﬁ  c pattern. If  there is not a control tower, it is the pilot’s responsibility to  determine the direction of the trafﬁ  c pattern, to comply with  the appropriate trafﬁ  c rules, and to display common courtesy  toward other pilots operating in the area.  

The pilot is not expected to have extensive knowledge of  all trafﬁ  c patterns at all airports; but if the pilot is familiar  with the basic rectangular pattern, it is easy to make proper  approaches and departures from most airports, regardless of  whether they have control towers. At airports with operating  control towers, the tower operator may instruct pilots to  enter the trafﬁ  c pattern at any point or to make a straight- in approach without ﬂ  ying the usual rectangular pattern.  Many other deviations are possible if the tower operator and  the pilot work together in an effort to keep trafﬁ  c moving  smoothly. Jets or heavy aircraft frequently ﬂ  y wider and/or  higher patterns than lighter aircraft and in many cases make  a straight-in approach for landing.  

The standard rectangular traffic pattern and terms are  illustrated in  Figure 10-1.  The terms of an airport in the  pattern after takeoff are described in  Figure 10-1.  

Departure leg—the ﬂ  ightpath which begins after takeoff  and continues straight ahead along the extended runway  centerline.  

Crosswind leg—a ﬂ  ightpath at right angles to the landing  runway off its takeoff end.  

Downwind leg—a ﬂ  ightpath parallel to the landing runway  in the opposite direction of landing.  

Base leg—a ﬂ  ightpath at right angles to the landing runway  off its approach end and extending from the downwind leg  to the intersection of the extended runway centerline (third  left hand  $90^{\circ}$   turn).  

Final approach—a ﬂ  ightpath in the direction of landing  along the extended runway centerline from the base leg to  the runway.  

Upwind leg—a ﬂ  ightpath parallel to the landing runway in  the direction of landing (not shown in  Figure 10-1 ).  

The trafﬁ  c pattern altitude is usually 1,000 feet above the  elevation of the airport surface; however, many airports use  different pattern altitudes for different types of aircraft. This  information can be found in the Airport/Facility Directory  (A/FD). The use of a common or known altitude at a given  airport is a key factor in minimizing the risk of collisions at  airports without operating control towers because aircraft can  be expected to be at a certain level making it easier to see.  

![](images/f7a2589f137a212e9dc84466776c463517f24e715ee66f0fc2568c33b4813a89.jpg)  
Figure 10-1.   Left and right hand traffic patterns. The WSC pattern altitude shown is the same as the airplane but the slower WSC aircraft  uses a smaller “inside pattern” or “tight pattern.”  

Compliance with the basic rectangular trafﬁ  c pattern reduces  the possibility of conﬂ  icts at airports without an operating  control tower. It is imperative that the pilot form the habit of  exercising constant vigilance in the vicinity of airports even  though the air trafﬁ  c appears to be light. The objective is to  have both the fast and the slower weight-shift control (WSC)  aircraft completing the pattern at the same interval.  

The slower the aircraft is, the tighter the pattern is, as shown  in  Figure 10-1.  The terminology is a “tight pattern” or “inside  pattern” for the slower WSC aircraft in operations with faster  aircraft. Using  Figure 10-1  as an example, if the airplane is  ﬂ  ying the pattern at 80 knots and the WSC aircraft is ﬂ  ying  an inside pattern at 40 knots (that is half the distance), then  the WSC aircraft and the airplane will ﬂ  y around the pattern  with the same interval. The WSC pilot must determine  the size of the pattern to create the same interval. This is  commonplace at nontowered airports where WSC aircraft  operate with faster aircraft. Both aircraft are going around  the pattern at the same time with the slower WSC aircraft  ﬂ  ying a tighter pattern and the faster airplane ﬂ  ying the larger  pattern. In  Figure 10-2,  the WSC aircraft is establishing an  inside airport pattern turning from crosswind to downwind.  In  Figure 10-3,  the aircraft shown is in the middle of the  downwind leg ﬂ  ying an inside pattern.  

When entering the trafﬁ  c pattern at an airport without an  operating control tower, inbound pilots are expected to  listen to the other aircraft on the CTAF (Common Trafﬁ  c  Advisory Frequency), observe other aircraft already in the  pattern, and conform to the trafﬁ  c pattern in use. If other  aircraft are not in the pattern, then trafﬁ  c indicators on the  ground and wind indicators must be checked to determine  which runway and trafﬁ  c pattern direction should be used.  [Figure 10-4  and  10-5]  Many airports have L-shaped trafﬁ  c  pattern indicators displayed with a segmented circle adjacent  to the runway. The short member of the L shows the direction  in which trafﬁ  c pattern turns should be made when using  the runway parallel to the long member. These indicators  should be checked while at a distance away from any pattern  that might be in use, or while at a safe height above pattern  altitudes. When the proper trafﬁ  c pattern direction has been  determined, the pilot should then proceed to a point clear of  the pattern before descending to the pattern altitude.

Figure 10-6.   Example of traffic pattern indicator on sectional  showing right hand pattern for runway 9. See Figure 10-5 for  segmented circle for this airport.  

A segmented circle in  Figure 10-7  provides trafﬁ  c patterns  so there is no air trafﬁ  c over the lower right hand area, which  could be a hazard or populated area.  

Inbound to an uncontrolled airport, the CTAF frequency  should be monitored to listen for other aircraft in the pattern  to ﬁ  nd out what is the active runway being used by other air  trafﬁ  c.  [Figure 10-8]  

When approaching an airport for landing, the trafﬁ  c pattern  should be entered at a  $45^{\circ}$   angle to the downwind leg, headed  toward a point abeam of the midpoint of the runway to be  used for landing as shown in  Figures 10-1  and  10-7.  Arriving  aircraft should be at the proper trafﬁ  c pattern altitude before  entering the pattern and should stay clear of the trafﬁ  c  ﬂ  ow until established on the entry leg. Entries into trafﬁ  c  patterns while descending create speciﬁ  c collision hazards  and should always be avoided. During the WSC   $45^{\circ}$   entry  into the pattern, the WSC aircraft must pass through the  larger airplane pattern, so it is essential that alert see-and- avoid procedures plus additional radio communications be  practiced during this transition.  

The entry leg should be of sufﬁ  cient length to provide a  clear view of the entire trafﬁ  c pattern and to allow the pilot  adequate time for planning the intended path in the pattern  and the landing approach.  

The downwind leg is a course ﬂ  own parallel to the landing  runway but in a direction opposite to the intended landing  direction. This leg for the slower WSC aircraft should be  approximately   $\%$   to   $\%$   mile out from the landing runway,  and at the speciﬁ  ed trafﬁ  c pattern altitude unless the airport  speciﬁ cally speciﬁ es a lower altitude for WSC aircraft. [Figure 10-9]  The faster airplanes would be  $\%$   to 1 mile  out from the landing runway. During this leg, the before  landing check should be completed. Pattern altitude should  be maintained until abeam the approach end of the landing  runway. At this point, power should be reduced and a descent  begun. The downwind leg continues past a point abeam the  approach end of the runway to a point approximately   $45^{\circ}$    from the approach end of the runway, and a medium bank  turn is made onto the base leg.  

The base leg is the transitional part of the trafﬁ  c pattern  between the downwind leg and the final approach leg.  Depending on the wind condition, it is established at a  sufﬁ  cient distance from the approach end of the landing  runway to permit a gradual descent to the intended touchdown  point. The ground track of the aircraft while on the base leg  should be perpendicular to the extended centerline of the  landing runway, although the longitudinal axis of the aircraft  may not be aligned with the ground track when it is necessary  to turn into the wind to counteract drift. While on the base  leg and before turning onto the ﬁ  nal approach, the pilot must  ensure that there is no danger of colliding with another aircraft

that may be on the ﬁ  nal approach. This is especially important  since the WSC aircraft is in a tighter pattern and could be  ﬂ  ying onto the ﬁ  nal approach of faster airplanes.  

The ﬁ  nal approach leg is a descending ﬂ  ightpath starting  from the completion of the base-to-ﬁ  nal turn and extending to  the point of touchdown. This is probably the most important  leg of the entire pattern because the pilot’s judgment and  procedures must be the sharpest to control the airspeed and  descent angle accurately while approaching the intended  touchdown point.  

As stipulated in 14 CFR part 91, aircraft while on ﬁ  nal  approach to land or while landing have the right-of-way over  other aircraft in ﬂ  ight or operating on the surface. When two  or more aircraft are approaching an airport for the purpose of  landing, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right of way.  A pilot should not take advantage of this rule to cut in front  of or overtake another aircraft on ﬁ  nal approach.  

The departure leg of the rectangular pattern is a straight  course aligned with, and leading from, the takeoff runway.  This leg begins at the point the aircraft leaves the ground  and continues until the   $90^{\circ}$   turn onto the crosswind leg is  started. On the departure leg after takeoff, the pilot should  continue climbing straight ahead, and, if remaining in the  trafﬁ  c pattern, commence a turn to the crosswind leg beyond  the departure end of the runway within 300 feet of pattern  altitude. If departing the trafﬁ  c pattern, continue straight out  or exit with a   $45^{\circ}$   turn (to the left when in a left-hand trafﬁ  c  pattern; to the right when in a right-hand trafﬁ  c pattern)  beyond the departure end of the runway after reaching  pattern altitude.  

An upwind leg is a course ﬂ  own parallel to the landing  runway, but in the same direction as the intended landing  direction. The upwind leg continues past a point abeam the  departure end of the runway to where a medium bank  $90^{\circ}$    turn is made onto the crosswind leg. The upwind leg is also  the transitional part of the trafﬁ  c pattern when on the ﬁ  nal  approach and a go-around is initiated and climb attitude is  established. When a safe altitude is attained, the pilot should  commence a shallow bank turn to the right side of the runway.  This allows better visibility of the runway for departing  aircraft.  [Figure 10-10]  

The crosswind leg is the part of the rectangular pattern that is  horizontally perpendicular to the extended centerline of the  takeoff runway and is entered by making approximately a  $90°$  turn from the departure or upwind leg. On the crosswind leg,  the aircraft proceeds to the downwind leg position.

# Figure 10-10.   Upwind leg.  

In most cases, the takeoff is made into the wind in which  case it is now approximately perpendicular to the aircraft’s  ﬂ  ightpath. As a result, the aircraft has to be turned or headed  slightly into the wind while on the crosswind leg to maintain  a ground track that is perpendicular to the runway centerline  extension.  

# Chapter Summary  

Airport patterns provide organized air trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ows into and  out of an airport. An airport trafﬁ  c pattern is established  appropriate to the local conditions, including the direction and  placement of the pattern, altitude to be ﬂ  own, and procedures  for entering and leaving the pattern.  

The legs of an airport pattern from takeoff are:  

•  Departure—direction of takeoff on the centerline of  the runway •  Crosswind—ﬁ  rst  $90^{\circ}$   turn ﬂ  ying perpendicular to the  takeoff direction •  Downwind—second   $90^{\circ}$   turn ﬂ  ying parallel to the  takeoff direction opposite the direction of takeoff and  landing •  Base—third  $90^{\circ}$   turn ﬂ  ying perpendicular towards the  runway centerline •  Final—forth  $90^{\circ}$   turn headed down the centerline of  the runway to land  

Pilots must research and determine from preﬂ  ight preparation  the possible runways and patterns for runways at the intended  airports for the ﬂ  ight. The pilot must determine the actual  pattern at the airport from observation and talking with other  pilots on the CTAF or from the wind direction if no other  pilots are in the pattern. Normal airport patterns are always  left hand unless indicated otherwise.  

Additional information on airport operations can be found  in the Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge,  the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), Chapter 2,  Aeronautical Lighting and Other Airport Visual Aids, Chapter  4, Air Trafﬁ  c Control, and Chapter 5, Air Trafﬁ  c Procedures;  and 14 CFR part 91, Subpart B, Flight Rules, Subpart C,  Equipment, Instrument and Certiﬁ  cate Requirements, and  Subpart D, Special Flight Operations.  

# Approaches and Landings  

# Introduction  

Approaches and landings are critical maneuvers and require  the skills built from basic ﬂ  ight maneuvers, ground reference  maneuvers, and airport trafﬁ  c patterns. A proper approach is  required for a proper roundout and touchdown. With the large  number of environmental variables the pilot must consider,  in addition to the skill to judge aircraft speed, descent rate,  and distance above the ground, landing is normally the last  basic maneuver the student learns before solo.  

Approaches and landings will be ﬁ  rst discussed with the  fundamentals of a normal approach and landing in calm  winds on a large hard-surfaced runway. This will provide the  basis for speciﬁ  c power-on, crosswind, and steep approach  maneuvers, as well as other types of approaches and landings  that WSC commonly encounter.  

# Normal (Calm Wind) Approaches and  Landings  

A normal or regular approach and landing involves the use  of procedures for what is considered a simple situation. It  provides the minimum number of variables for the student  pilot to learn during the ﬁ  rst landings; that is, when engine  power is at idle, wind is light, and the ﬁ  nal approach is  made directly into the wind, the ﬁ  nal approach path has no  obstacles, and the landing surface is ﬁ  rm and of ample length  to bring the aircraft gradually to a stop. This includes normal  runways used for WSC that are asphalt, concrete, solid dirt,  gravel or short grass. The selected landing point should be  beyond the runway’s approach threshold but within the ﬁ  rst  one-third portion of the runway.  

The factors involved and the procedures described for the  normal approach and landing also have applications to  the other-than-normal approaches and landings which are  discussed later in this chapter. Therefore, the principles of  simple (or normal) operations are explained ﬁ  rst and must be  understood before proceeding to more complex operations.  

To assist the pilot in understanding the factors that inﬂ  uence  judgment and procedures, the last part of the approach pattern  and the actual landing is divided into ﬁ  ve phases:  

•  Base leg •  Final approach •  Roundout •  Touchdown •  After-landing roll  

Remember that the manufacturer’s recommended procedures,  including aircraft conﬁ  guration, airspeeds, power, and other  information relevant to approaches and landings in a speciﬁ  c  make and model aircraft are contained in the Aircraft Flight  Manual (AFM) and/or Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH)  for that aircraft. If any of the information in this chapter  differs from the aircraft manufacturer’s recommendations  as contained in the AFM/POH, the aircraft manufacturer’s  recommendations take precedence.  

# Throttle Use  

As discussed in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics, the WSC aircraft  has a good glide ratio, and normal landings can easily be  done with the power at idle. It is a good practice to master  the landings with the throttle at idle so that the glide angle,  speeds, and descent rates become habit and part of a normal  routine. This is helpful so that, if there is an engine failure,  the pilot is accustomed to landing with minimum power and  is able to spot land the WSC aircraft for emergency conditions  at or beyond a speciﬁ  ed point. As a general practice for  normal landings in calm conditions or a slight headwind,  the throttle should be brought back to idle at the start of the  base leg for landings.  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), section  91.119, Minimum Safe Altitudes: General, is an important  safety precaution and states: “Except when necessary  for takeoff or landing, no person may operate an aircraft  anywhere below... an altitude allowing, if a power unit fails,  an emergency landing without undue hazard to persons or  property on the surface.” This allows long ﬁ  nal approaches  “with power when necessary,” but overall, it is important to  be no lower than an altitude from which you can glide to a safe  landing area. For the purposes of this approach-and-landing  discussion, it is assumed that there are no safe landing areas  other than the runway.  

It should be noted that the power is above idle for some  landing situations, such as:  

•  Students ﬁ  rst learning to land; a slower rate of descent  is the result of higher power settings. In this case, the  landings would be done with a target farther down the  runway so a safe landing could always be made with  engine failure. •  Shallower descent angle if directed by air trafﬁ  c control  (ATC), or a longer ﬁ  nal approach is required. •  High winds and/or turbulent conditions requiring a  higher energy level.  

For landings where throttle is required, the foot throttle is  typically used so the hands can stay on the control bar while  approaching the ground for this critical phase of ﬂ  ight.  However, the hand/cruise throttle may be set above idle for  speciﬁ  c situations as required by the pilot. Higher power  settings for approaches and landings are discussed later in  this chapter.  

# Base Leg  

The placement of the base leg is one of the more important  judgments made by the pilot in any landing approach.  [Figure 11-1]  The pilot must accurately judge the altitude  and distance from which the descent results in landing at  the desired point.  

The base leg should be started at a point where the power  can be brought back to idle and the WSC aircraft can glide to  the landing spot at the approach speed recommended by the  manufacturer. The intended landing point should not be at the  end of the runway on a threshold or numbers, but beyond at  the landing lines.  [Figure 11-2]  This provides some margin  if the landing is shorter than anticipated. For smaller runways  that do not have these markings, establish an appropriate  

![](images/3d6c7ec2cf3d99e27e2b7120cc907101fc6ee7612025a917c16c4870d3d773a7.jpg)  
Figure 11-1.  Base leg and final approach.  

landing point beyond the start of the runway, allowing plenty  of room for the after-landing roll. At much larger airports, the  landing can be done farther down the runway or at a location  where the pilot can taxi off the runway and not delay other  air trafﬁ  c behind the aircraft.  

After turning onto the base leg, the pilot should continue  the descent with reduced power and approach airspeed as  recommended by the manufacturer. As discussed in Chapter  7, Takeoff and Departure, this speed is at least 1.3 times the  stall speed. Landing trim should be adjusted according to  manufacturer speciﬁ  cations (if equipped).  

Drift correction should be established and maintained to follow  a ground track perpendicular to the extension of the centerline  of the runway on which the landing is to be made. Since the  ﬁ  nal approach and landing are normally made into the wind,  there may be a crosswind during the base leg. The aircraft must  be angled sufﬁ  ciently into the wind to prevent drifting farther  away from the intended landing point.  

The base leg should be continued to the point where a  medium- to shallow-banked turn aligns the aircraft’s path  directly with the centerline of the landing runway. This  descending turn should be completed at a safe altitude that is  dependent upon the height of the terrain and any obstructions  along the ground track. The turn to the ﬁ  nal approach should  also be sufﬁ  ciently above the airport elevation to permit a  

![](images/20bf63f7488dce59c55d6970d26ae721937064b514a790c3be560d59f891d0ed.jpg)  
Figure 11-2.  Typical landing position on runway.  

ﬁ  nal approach long enough for the pilot to accurately estimate  the resultant point of touchdown, while maintaining the  proper approach airspeed. This requires careful planning  for the starting point and radius of the turn.  [Figure 11-3]   Normally, it is recommended that the angle of bank not  exceed a medium bank because the steeper the angle of bank,  the higher the airspeed at which the aircraft stalls. Since the  base-to-ﬁ  nal turn is made at a relatively low altitude, it is  important that a stall not occur at this point. If an extremely  steep bank is needed to prevent overshooting the proper ﬁ  nal  approach path, it is advisable to discontinue the approach, go  around, and plan to start the turn earlier on the next approach  rather than risk a hazardous situation.

Figure 11-3.  On base preparing to turn onto final.  

# Final Approach  

After the base-to-final approach turn is completed, the  aircraft should be aligned directly in the extension of the  centerline of the runway. The objective of a good ﬁ  nal  approach is to approach the runway with sufﬁ  cient energy  (manufacturer’s recommended airspeed) to land at or  beyond some predetermined point. The landing area should  provide sufﬁ  cient runway behind for variations in approach  conditions and runway ahead to allow either a full stop or a  go-around if needed.  

If there is a crosswind of any kind, the aircraft should be  pointed into the wind slightly (see the Crosswind Approaches  and Landings section). Focus should be to keep the ground  track aligned with the centerline of the runway or landing  surface, so that drift (if any) is recognized immediately. On  a normal approach, with no crosswind drift, the longitudinal  axis should be kept aligned with the runway centerline  throughout the approach and landing.  

After aligning the aircraft with the runway centerline, speed  is adjusted as required for the desired rate of descent. Slight  increases in power, if lower than expected, may be necessary  to maintain the descent angle at the desired approach  airspeed.  

The descent angle should be controlled throughout the  approach so that the aircraft lands in the center of the runway  at the aiming point, as discussed earlier. The descent angle is  affected by all four fundamental forces that act on an aircraft  (lift, drag, thrust, and weight). If all the forces are constant,  the descent angle is constant in calm air. The pilot can control  these forces by adjusting the airspeed and power. The ﬁ  nal  approach sequence is shown in  Figures 11-4  through  11-8.  

![](images/8b4a1fe149f3e2e69a02a4712f06817f32ae55d9067ac6603890b10d55ceda2a.jpg)

Figure 11-5.  Lining up on the runway centerline and maintaining  position.  

In a descent for ﬁ  nal approach, if the WSC is slowed with  an angle of attack that is too high and without an increase  of power, the aircraft settles very rapidly and touches down  short of the desired area. For this reason, the pilot should  never try to stretch a glide by applying forward control bar  pressure alone to reach the desired landing area. Because this  brings the speed below the minimum drag speed, the gliding  distance decreases if power is not added simultaneously.

Additionally, this is a lower energy approach and may be  slower than the manufacturer’s safe approach speed. The  proper angle of descent to the runway must be maintained at  the minimum speed recommended by the manufacturer, with  a ﬂ  atter descent angle obtained with increases in power as  required. Steeper descent angles are obtained with headwinds  or the pilot increasing speed/decreasing the angle of attack,  both of which are covered later in this chapter.  

# Estimating Height and Movement  

During the ﬁ  nal approach, roundout, and touchdown, vision is  of prime importance. To provide a wide scope of vision and  to foster good judgment of height and movement, the pilot’s  head should assume a natural, straight-ahead position. The  pilot’s visual focus should not be ﬁ  xed on any one side or  any one spot ahead of the aircraft. The pilot should maintain  a deliberate awareness of the runway centerline (if available)  or distance from either side of the runway within his or her  peripheral ﬁ  eld of vision.  

Accurate estimation of distance is, besides being a matter of  practice, dependent upon how clearly objects are seen; vision  must be focused properly so that important objects stand out  as clearly as possible. Speed blurs objects at close range. For  example, one can note this effect in an automobile moving  at high speed. Nearby objects seem to merge together in a  blur, while objects farther away stand out clearly. The driver  subconsciously focuses the eyes sufﬁ  ciently far ahead of the  automobile to see objects distinctly.  

The distance at which the pilot’s vision is focused should be  proportionate to the speed at which the aircraft is traveling  over the ground. Thus, as speed is reduced during the  roundout, the focus distance ahead of the aircraft should be  decreased accordingly.  

If the pilot attempts to focus on a reference that is too close  or looks directly down, the reference is blurred, and the  reaction is either too abrupt or too late. In this case, the  pilot’s tendency is to overcontrol, round out high, and make a  stalled, drop-in landing. When the pilot focuses too far ahead,  accuracy in judging the closeness of the ground is lost and  the consequent reaction is too slow since there is no apparent  necessity for action. This results in the aircraft ﬂ  ying into the  ground nose ﬁ  rst without a proper roundout.  

The best way to recognize and become accustomed to heights  and speeds for a particular WSC aircraft is to perform low  passes over the runway, as discussed earlier, with energy  management. Perform a normal approach ﬁ  rst, then a high- energy pass at a higher speed, and then medium-energy  passes at lower speeds. These exercises are performed ﬁ  rst  in calm winds at a height, as an example, at which the wheels  are 10 feet above the runway, then lowering to just inches  above the runway as the pilot’s skills build. The objective  is to become proﬁ  cient at ﬂ  ying straight down the runway  centerline at a constant altitude. This exercise provides the  opportunity to determine height and speed over the runway  before any landings are performed. These should generally  be performed in mild conditions. Higher energy and greater  heights above the runway are required in windier and bumpier  conditions.  

# Roundout (  Flare)  

The roundout is a slow, smooth transition from a normal  approach speed to a landing attitude, gradually rounding out  the ﬂ  ightpath to one that is parallel with, and within a very  few inches above, the runway. When the aircraft, in a normal  descent, approaches within what appears to be 10 to 15 feet  above the ground, the roundout or ﬂ  are should be started and  be a continuous process slowing until the aircraft touches  down on the ground.  

It should be noted that the terms “roundout” and “ﬂ  are” are  deﬁ  ned and used interchangeably throughout the aviation  industry for slowing the aircraft during ﬁ  nal approach and  touching down. The term “roundout” is used in this handbook  since it provides a better description for the WSC landing  process and WSC students are more successful learning  landings using the term roundout instead of ﬂ  are.  

As the aircraft reaches a height where the back wheels are one  to two inches above the ground, the roundout is continued  by gradually pushing the control bar forward as required to  maintain one to two inches above the runway as the WSC  aircraft slows.  [Figure 11-9]  This causes the aircraft’s  nosewheel to gradually rise to the desired landing attitude.  The AOA should be increased at a rate that allows the aircraft  to continue ﬂ  ying just above the runway as forward speed  decreases until the control bar is full forward and the back  wheels settle onto the runway.  

During the roundout, the airspeed is decreased to touchdown  speed while the lift is controlled so the aircraft settles gently  onto the landing surface. The roundout should be executed  at a rate at which the proper landing attitude and the proper  touchdown airspeed are attained simultaneously just as the  wheels contact the landing surface.  

The rate at which the roundout is executed depends on the  aircraft’s height above the ground, the rate of descent, and  the airspeed. A roundout started excessively high must be  executed more slowly than one from a lower height to allow  the aircraft to descend to the ground while the proper landing  attitude is being established. The rate of rounding out must  also be proportionate to the rate of closure with the ground.  When the aircraft appears to be descending very slowly, the  increase in pitch attitude (slowing of the WSC) must be made  at a correspondingly low rate.  

Visual cues are important in roundout at the proper altitude and  maintaining the wheels a few inches above the runway until  eventual touchdown. Roundout cues are dependent primarily  on the angle at which the pilot’s central vision intersects the  ground (or runway) ahead and slightly to the side. Proper  depth perception is a factor in a successful roundout, but the  visual cues used most are those related to changes in runway or  terrain perspective and to changes in the size of familiar objects  near the landing area such as fences, bushes, trees, hangars,  and even sod or runway texture. The pilot should direct central  vision at a shallow downward angle of  $10^{\circ}$   to  $15^{\circ}$   toward the  runway as the roundout is initiated.  [Figure 11-10]  

Maintaining the same viewing angle causes the point of  visual interception with the runway to move progressively  rearward toward the pilot as the aircraft loses altitude. This is  an important visual cue in assessing the rate of altitude loss.  

![](images/e3c62796db47f39ce09a8b40d56c8c1126d59a9a35f6741545b82ddb9632646f.jpg)

Figure 11-10.  To obtain necessary visual cues, the pilot should look toward the runway at a shallow angle.  

Conversely, forward movement of the visual interception  point indicates an increase in altitude and would mean  that the pitch angle was increased too rapidly resulting in  an over roundout. The following are also used to judge  when the wheels are just a few inches above the runway:  location of the visual interception point in conjunction with  assessment of ﬂ  ow velocity of nearby off-runway terrain,  and the similarity in appearance of height above the runway  ahead of the aircraft to the way it looked when the aircraft  was taxied prior to takeoff.  

A common error during the roundout is rounding out too much  and too fast. This error can easily be avoided by gradually  increasing the AOA with a controlled descent until the wheels  are one inch above the surface and never climbing during a  roundout with a gradual and controlled roundout.  

# Touchdown  

After a controlled roundout, the touchdown is the gentle  settling of the aircraft onto the landing surface. For calm  air conditions, the roundout can be made with the engine  idling, and touchdown can be made at minimum controllable  airspeed so that the aircraft touches down on the main gear  at the approximate stalling speed. As the aircraft settles, the  proper landing attitude is attained by application of whatever  control bar forward pressure is necessary. In calm wind  conditions, the goal is to round out smoothly and have the  control bar touch the front tube as the back wheels touch the  ground.  [Figures 11-11  through  11-14]  Once the rear wheel  settles to the surface, the nosewheel settles to the ground. The  control bar should be pulled all the way back to eliminate  the possibility of lifting off the ground because of a wind  gust. Pulling the nose down completely can also be used for  aerodynamic braking if needed.  

# After-Landing Roll  

The landing process must never be considered complete  until the aircraft decelerates to normal taxi speed during the  

![](images/9b68ada77a0ae2850756adb1b3820ad74429e70f63ec67aeb5530aa35102e640.jpg)

landing roll or has been brought to a complete stop when clear  of the landing area. Many accidents have occurred as a result  of pilots abandoning their vigilance and positive control after  getting the aircraft on the ground.

Figure 11-14.   Completing the roundout with the control bar full  forward and the back wheels settling to the runway.  

The pilot must make only slight turns to maintain direction  until the WSC has slowed to taxiing speed. An abrupt turn  at high speed could possibly lift a rear wheel, roll the WSC  over, or force the wingtip to the ground. The WSC must slow  to taxing speed before before any sharp turn can be made to  exit the runway.  

The brakes of an aircraft serve the same primary purpose as  the brakes of an automobile—to reduce speed on the ground.  Maximum brake effectiveness is just short of the skid point.  If the brakes are applied so hard that skidding takes place,  braking becomes ineffective. Skidding can be stopped by  releasing the brake pressure. Also, braking effectiveness is  not enhanced by alternately applying and reapplying brake  pressure. The brakes should be applied ﬁ  rmly and smoothly  as necessary.  

WSC aircraft have nosewheel or rear wheel braking systems.  For nosewheel systems, if braking is required right away, the  nose should be lowered so the nosewheel touches the ground  and the brakes can be applied. The nose should be lowered  for any aerodynamic braking at the higher speeds.  

Lowering the nose also provides greater force on the front  wheel for superior braking effectiveness. Any skidding of the  front wheel with braking causes the loss of directional control  of the WSC aircraft and the skidding must be stopped by  letting up on the brake. Skidding can be the greatest problem  operating on slick surfaces such as wet grass. Rear wheel  braking systems are heavier and more complex, but provide  better braking force because there are two wheels instead of  one and there is more weight on the rear wheels. Braking  effectiveness should be evaluated by the pilot for each type  of runway being used. If the available runway permits, the  speed of the aircraft should be allowed to dissipate in a normal  manner with minimum use of brakes.  [Figure 11-15]

Figure 11-15.   WSC aircraft follows the taxi line to exit the runway  while slowing the aircraft and maintaining control of the wing.  

The control bar serves the same purpose on the ground as  in the air—it changes the lift and drag components of the  wings. During the after-landing roll, the control bar should  be used to keep the wings level in much the same way it is  used in ﬂ  ight. If a wing starts to rise, roll control should be  applied to lower it. Procedures for crosswind conditions are  explained further in the Crosswind Approach and Landing  section of this chapter.  

# Effect of Headwinds During Final  Approach  

A headwind plays a prominent role in the gliding distance  over the ground. Strong headwinds decrease the glide as  shown in the comparison in  Figure 11-16A  with no wind  normal glide versus  Figure 11-16B  in headwind with steeper  glide. To account for a steeper glide in a headwind, the base  leg must be positioned closer to the approach end of the  runway than would be required with a light wind. Therefore,  

![](images/578e0598564d5db511a263d0d71a95985396ab4abe8c12cf45a3a29a7eda4b40.jpg)  
Figure 11-16.  Headwinds for final approach.  

the base leg must be made closer to the runway to land in  the intended area in a headwind.  [Figure 11-16 C]  However,  if more headwind is experienced during ﬁ  nal approach,  increased power is required to make the intended landing  area.  [Figure 11-16 D]  

Naturally, the pilot does not have control over the wind but  may correct for its effect on the aircraft’s descent by adjusting  the base leg of the pattern. The wind can vary signiﬁ  cantly  at different attitudes and locations in the pattern. If the pilot  does not notice the headwind until the base leg, the base  leg should be cut short and the pilot should head towards  the runway sooner. This would provide the best possibility  of making the runway if there is an engine failure in this  situation.  [Figure 11-17]  

Additionally, during strong headwinds, more energy (power  and airspeed) should be used since the wind gradient (slowing  of the wind near the ground because of the friction of the  ground) could reduce the airspeed and cause a stall on  approach near the ground in higher winds.  

# Stabilized Approach Concept  

A stabilized approach is one in which the pilot establishes and  maintains a constant angle glidepath toward a predetermined  point on the landing runway. It is based on the pilot’s judgment  of certain visual clues and depends on the maintenance of a  constant ﬁ  nal descent airspeed.  

An aircraft descending on ﬁ  nal approach at a constant rate  and airspeed is traveling in a straight line toward a point on  the ground ahead. This point is not the point on which the  aircraft touches down because some ﬂ  oat inevitably occurs  during the roundout.  

The point toward which the aircraft is progressing is termed  the “aiming point.”  [Figure 11-18]  It is the point on the  ground at which, if the aircraft maintains a constant glidepath  and was not rounded out for landing, it would strike the  ground. To a pilot moving straight ahead toward an object,  it appears to be stationary. This is how the aiming point can  be distinguished—it does not move. However, objects in  front of and beyond the aiming point do appear to move as  the distance is closed, and they appear to move in opposite  directions. During instruction in landings, one of the most  important skills a student pilot must acquire is the use of  visual cues to accurately determine the true aiming point  from any distance out on ﬁ  nal approach. From this, the pilot  is able not only to determine if the glidepath results in an  undershoot or overshoot, but also to predict the touchdown  point to within a few feet taking into account ﬂ  oat during  roundout.  

![](images/5e6117fe76b0b8156340f5f68a746aa341e1dfb0f9125ce7da0278b8fe69e6fa.jpg)

Figure 11-18.   Stabilized approach.  

For a constant angle glidepath, the distance between the  horizon and the aiming point remain constant. If a ﬁ  nal  approach descent has been established but the distance  between the perceived aiming point and the horizon  appears to increase (aiming point moving down, away from  the horizon), then the true aiming point and subsequent  touchdown point is farther down the runway. If the distance  between the perceived aiming point and the horizon decreases  (aiming point moving up toward the horizon), the true aiming  point is closer than perceived.  

When the aircraft is established on ﬁ  nal approach, the shape  of the runway image also presents clues regarding what  must be done to maintain a stabilized approach to a safe  landing. A runway is normally shaped in the form of an  elongated rectangle. When viewed from the air during the  approach, perspective causes the runway to assume the shape  of a trapezoid with the far end appearing narrower than the  approach end, and the edge lines converging in the distance.  If the aircraft continues down the glidepath at a constant angle  (stabilized), the image the pilot sees is still trapezoidal but  of proportionately larger dimensions.  

During a stabilized approach, the runway shape does not  change.  [Figure 11-19]  If the approach becomes shallower,  the runway appears to shorten and become wider. Conversely,  if the approach is steepened, the runway appears to become  longer and narrower.  [Figure 11-20]  

The objective of a stabilized approach is to select an  appropriate touchdown point on the runway and adjust  the glidepath so that the true aiming point and the desired  touchdown point coincide. Immediately after rolling out of  base leg and onto ﬁ  nal approach, the pilot should adjust the  speed so that the aircraft descends directly toward the aiming  point. With the approach set up in this manner, the pilot is  free to devote full attention to outside references. The pilot  should not stare at any one place, but rather scan from one  area to another, such as from the aiming point to the horizon,  to the trees and bushes along the runway, to an area well  short of the runway, and back to the aiming point. In this  way, the pilot is more apt to perceive a deviation from the  desired glidepath and whether or not the aircraft is proceeding  directly toward the aiming point.  

If the pilot perceives any indication that the aiming point  on the runway is not where desired, an adjustment must be  made to the glidepath. This in turn moves the aiming point.  For instance, if the pilot perceives that the aiming point  is signiﬁ  cantly short of the desired touchdown point and  results in an undershoot, an increase in power is warranted.  The minimum airspeed recommended by the manufacturer  must be maintained. This results in a shallowing of the  glidepath with the resultant aiming point moving toward the  desired touchdown point. Conversely, if the pilot perceives  that the aiming point is farther down the runway than the  desired touchdown point and results in an overshoot, the  glidepath should be steepened by an increase in speed with  the throttle at idle. It is essential that deviations from the  desired glidepath be detected early, so that only slight and  infrequent adjustments to glidepath are required.  

If a situation arises in which the required corrections become  larger (and possibly more frequent) as the aircraft draws closer  to the runway, an unstabilized approach results.  

Common errors in the performance of normal approaches and  landings include the following:  

•  Not realizing there is a tailwind during downwind to  complete an early base  •  Inadequate wind drift correction on the base leg

•   Overshooting or undershooting the turn onto ﬁ  nal  approach  •   Unstabilized approach •   Attempting to maintain altitude or reach the runway  by slowing WSC aircraft below the minimum  manufacturer’s recommended approach airspeed •  Gaining any altitude during the roundout •  Rounding out too fast during landing •  Focusing too close to the aircraft, resulting in an overly  high roundout •   Focusing too far from the aircraft, resulting in an overly  low roundout •   Touching down prior to attaining proper landing  attitude •   Failure to lower the nose after the rear wheels touch  down •  Failure to lower the nose after the front wheel touches  down •   Excessive braking after touchdown  

# Go-Around (  Rejected Landings)  

Whenever landing conditions are not satisfactory, a go-around  is warranted. There are many factors that can contribute  to unsatisfactory landing conditions. Situations such as  ATC requirements, unexpected appearance of hazards on  the runway, overtaking another aircraft, wind shear, wake  turbulence, mechanical failure and/or an unstabilized approach  are all examples of reasons to discontinue a landing approach  and make another approach under more favorable conditions.  The assumption that an aborted landing is invariably the  consequence of a poor approach, which in turn is due to  insufﬁ  cient experience or skill, is a fallacy. The go-around is  not strictly an emergency procedure. It is a normal maneuver  that may at times be used in an emergency situation. Like  any other normal maneuver, the go-around must be practiced  and perfected. The ﬂ  ight instructor should emphasize early  in the student pilot’s training that the go-around maneuver is  an alternative to any approach and/or landing.  

Although the need to discontinue a landing may arise at any  point in the landing process, the most critical go-around is  one started when very close to the ground. Therefore, the  earlier a condition that warrants a go-around is recognized,  the safer the go-around/rejected landing is. The go-around  maneuver is not inherently dangerous in itself. It becomes  dangerous only when delayed unduly or executed improperly.  Delay in initiating the go-around normally stems from one  or both of two sources:  

1.  Landing expectancy or set—the anticipatory belief  that conditions are not as threatening as they are and  that the approach will surely be terminated with a safe  landing, and  2.  Pride—the mistaken belief that the act of going around  is an admission of failure to execute the approach  properly. The improper execution of the go-around  maneuver stems from a lack of familiarity with the  two cardinal principles of the procedure: power and  speed.  

# Power  

Power is the pilot’s ﬁ  rst concern. The instant the pilot decides  to go around, full or maximum allowable takeoff power must  be applied smoothly and without hesitation and held until  ﬂ  ying speed and controllability are restored. Applying only  partial power in a go-around is never appropriate unless the  WSC aircraft is at an unusually high pitch angle. The pilot  must be aware of the degree of inertia that must be overcome  before an aircraft that is settling toward the ground can regain  sufﬁ  cient airspeed to become fully controllable and capable  of turning safely or climbing. The application of power  should be smooth as well as positive. Abrupt movements of  the throttle in some aircrafts causes the engine to falter.  

# Speed  

Speed is always critical when close to the ground. When  power is added, a deliberate effort on the part of the pilot  is required to keep the nose from pitching up prematurely.  The aircraft executing a go-around must be maintained well  beyond the stall point before any effort is made to gain  altitude or to execute a turn. Raising the nose too early may  produce a stall from which the aircraft could not recover if the  go-around is performed at a low altitude. The manufacturer’s  recommended climb speed should be established and  maintained during the initial phase of the go around.  

A concern for quickly regaining altitude during a go-around  produces a natural tendency to push the nose up. The pilot  executing a go-around must accept the fact that an aircraft  will not climb until it can ﬂ  y, and it will not ﬂ  y below stall  speed. In some circumstances, it may be desirable to lower  the nose brieﬂ  y to gain airspeed.  [Figure 11-21]  

During the initial part of an extremely low go-around, the  aircraft may settle onto the runway and bounce. This situation  is not particularly dangerous if the aircraft is kept straight and  a constant, safe speed is maintained. The aircraft is rapidly  approaching safe ﬂ  ying speed and the advanced power will  cushion any secondary touchdown.  

![](images/98b591a74f3efcbdd235f0fb9f529d61554176c7504cb4e25893d4c0428347f3.jpg)  
Figure 11-21.   Go-around procedure.  

Common errors in the performance of go-around (rejected  landings) are:  

•   Failure to recognize a condition that warrants a  rejected landing, •   Indecision, •   Delay in initiating a go-round, •   Failure to apply maximum allowable power in a timely  manner, •   Improper speed, •   Attempting to climb out of ground effect prematurely,  and •   Failure to adequately compensate for torque/P- factor.  

# Short and Soft Field Landing Techniques  

Many WSC aircraft land routinely on short and soft ﬁ  elds.  The type of WSC and appropriate systems for short and  soft ﬁ  eld was discussed in the Components and Systems  chapter. Here, some techniques for these landing areas are  discussed.  

# Short-Field Approaches and Landings  

Short-field approaches and landings require the use of  procedures for approaches and landings at fields with  a relatively short landing area or where an approach is  made over obstacles that limit the available landing area.  [Figure 11-22]  As in short-ﬁ  eld takeoffs, it is one of the most  critical of the maximum performance operations. It requires  that the pilot ﬂ  y the aircraft at one of its crucial performance  capabilities while close to the ground in order to land safely  within conﬁ  ned areas.  

To land within a short ﬁ  eld or conﬁ  ned area, the pilot must  have precise, positive control of the rate of descent and  airspeed to produce an approach that clears any obstacles,  results in little or no ﬂ  oating during the roundout, and permits  the aircraft to be stopped in the shortest possible distance. As  with the short takeoff maneuver, this should only be done  

![](images/3b3c3c1adae045f3aef09f60cd64df767350a87982213d391f7ebe7c0a19a445.jpg)  
Figure 11-22.   Short field landing.  

for unusual situations or emergency operations and is not  recommended. There are numerous airports, ﬁ  elds, and other  areas to land, so preﬂ  ight planning should avoid short-ﬁ  eld  landings. However, short-ﬁ  eld procedures are provided for  information.  

A stabilized approach is essential. These procedures generally  involve the starting to ﬁ  nal approach from an altitude of at  least 500 feet higher than the touchdown area. In the absence  of a manufacturer’s recommended approach speed and in  calm winds, example approach speeds are 1.3 times the stall  speed or 8 knots above the stall speed. For example, in an  aircraft that stalls at 30 knots with power off, the approach  speed should be 38 to 40 knots. This maneuver should not  be performed in gusty air because of the slow speeds and  close proximity to the ground. If it is necessary to accomplish  in gusty air, no more than one-half the gust factor should  be added. An excessive amount of airspeed could result  in a touchdown with an after-landing roll that exceeds the  available landing area.  

For the steepest glide angle to clear obstacles such as trees or  buildings, the maneuver should be performed at idle power; if  the landing surface does not have obstacles that must be ﬂ  own  over, power on approach may be used to reach the landing  surface. The pilot should simultaneously adjust the power and  the speed to establish and maintain the proper descent angle.  A coordinated combination of both speed and power (if used)  adjustments is required to set up a stabilized approach.  

The short-ﬁ  eld approach and landing is in reality an accuracy  approach to a spot landing. The procedures previously  outlined in the section on the stabilized approach concept  should be used. If it appears that the obstacle clearance is  excessive and touchdown will occur well beyond the desired  spot leaving insufﬁ  cient room to stop, lowering the pitch  attitude and reducing power (if used) steepen the descent path  and increase the rate of descent. If it appears that the descent  angle will not ensure safe clearance of obstacles, power  should be increased to shallow the descent path and decrease  the rate of descent. Care must be taken to avoid an excessively  low airspeed. If the speed is allowed to become too low, an  increase in pitch and application of full power may result in a  further rate of descent. This occurs when the AOA is too great  and creating so much drag that the maximum available power  is insufﬁ  cient to overcome it. This is generally referred to as  operating in the region of reversed command or operating on  the back side of the power curve.  

Because the final approach over obstacles is made at  a relatively steep approach angle and at the minimum  manufacturer’s recommended approach speed, the initiation  of the roundout must be judged accurately to avoid ﬂ  ying  into the ground or stalling prematurely and sinking rapidly.  A lack of ﬂ  oating during the roundout with sufﬁ  cient control  to touch down properly is one veriﬁ  cation that the approach  speed was correct.  

Upon touchdown, the nose should be brought down  completely for aerodynamic braking and providing maximum  pressure on the wheels for using the braking system.  Immediately upon touchdown, appropriate braking should be  applied to minimize the after-landing roll. The aircraft should  be stopped within the shortest possible distance consistent  with safety and controllability. If the situation arises and  the minimum landing distance is required, the WSC can be  landed above the normal speed, the nose brought down for  aerodynamic braking while the brakes are applied for the  shortest distance possible.  

# Soft and Rough Field Approaches and Landings  

Landing on ﬁ  elds that are rough or have soft surfaces, such as  snow, sand, mud, tall grass, or a rocky/bumpy ﬁ  eld requires  unique procedures. When landing on such surfaces, the  objective is to touch down as smoothly as possible and at  the lowest possible landing speed. The pilot must control the  aircraft so that the wings support the weight of the aircraft as  long as is practical to minimize drag and stresses imposed on  the landing gear by the rough or soft surface.  

Similar to the soft ﬁ  eld for takeoff, proper gear—speciﬁ  cally  big tires with a large wing and overall low weight—should be  utilized for soft or rough ﬁ  eld operations. Refer to appropriate  gear and warnings in Chapter 7, Takeoff and Departure  Climbs, for soft or rough ﬁ  eld operation as a prerequisite  for this chapter.  

The approach for the soft ﬁ  eld landing is similar to the normal  approach used for operating into long, ﬁ  rm landing areas.  The major difference between the two is that, during the soft  or rough ﬁ  eld landing, the distance on the soft/rough ﬁ  eld is  minimized and the weight is kept off the wheels by the lift  of the wing when on the soft/rough ﬁ  eld. Power can be used  throughout the level-off and touchdown to ensure touchdown  at the lowest possible airspeed, with the WSC aircraft ﬂ  own  onto the ground with the weight fully supported by the wings.  The touchdown should be planned for minimal taxi distance  to the stopping point so there is the shortest possible distance  with weight on the landing gear on the rough/soft surface.  [Figure 11-23]  

![](images/6a3d90ef07edc2b50eaa25f1d2f512b90937b1eaba6408e95fbceab8e3a9950a.jpg)  
Figure 11-23.   Soft/rough field approach and landing.  

Touchdown on a soft or rough ﬁ  eld should be made at the  lowest possible airspeed with the aircraft in a nose-high pitch  attitude. After the main wheels touch the surface, the pilot  should hold bar-forward pressure to keep the nosewheel off  the surface. Using forward control bar pressure and engine  power, the pilot can control the rate at which the weight of  the aircraft is transferred from the wings to the wheels.  

Field conditions may warrant that the pilot maintain a ﬂ  ight  condition where the main wheels are just touching the surface,  but the weight of the aircraft is still being supported by the  wings until a suitable taxi surface is reached. At any time  during this transition phase, before the weight of the aircraft  is being supported by the wheels and before the nosewheel  is on the surface, the pilot should be able to apply full power  and perform a safe takeoff (obstacle clearance and ﬁ  eld length  permitting) should the pilot elect to abandon the landing.  Once committed to a landing, the pilot should gently lower  the nosewheel to the surface. A slight reduction of power  usually helps ease the nosewheel down.  

The use of brakes on a soft ﬁ  eld is not needed and should  be avoided as this tends to impose a heavy load on the nose  gear due to premature or hard contact with the landing  surface causing the nosewheel to dig in. The soft or rough  surface itself provides sufﬁ  cient reduction in the aircraft’s  forward speed. Often upon landing on a very soft ﬁ  eld, the  pilot needs to increase power to keep the aircraft moving and  from becoming stuck on the soft surface.  

# Power-on Approach and Landing for  Turbulant Air  

Power-on approaches at an airspeed above the normal  approach speed should be used for landing in turbulent  air. This provides for more energy and positive control  of the aircraft when strong horizontal wind gusts, wind  sheer, or up and down drafts, are experienced. Like other  power-on approaches (when the pilot can vary the amount  of power), a coordinated combination of both speed and  power adjustments is usually required. It is easiest to think  of ﬂ  ying the aircraft onto the ground at an airspeed above  the stall speed. The additional power provides the pilot the  ability to reduce the descent rate to touch the wheels gently  to the surface at a higher speed. Landing in turbulent air is  where practice and experience in energy management are  utilized. This precise coordination of power and speed for  higher energy landings should ﬁ  rst be practiced in calm air  and can be used as the next step in learning landings after the  student becomes proﬁ  cient at low approaches.  

To determine the additional approach speed to ﬂ  ying in  turbulence, one procedure is to use the normal approach  speed plus one-half of the wind gust factors. The wind gust  factor is determined by how much the airspeed varies while  ﬂ  ying. If the normal approach speed is 50 knots and the wind  gusts are at 15 knots, an airspeed of 57 knots is appropriate.  Another method is to ensure the aircraft is at least at  $\mathrm{V_{Y}}$   speed  plus the wind gust factor. In any case, the airspeed that the  aircraft manufacturer recommends.  

An adequate amount of power should be used to maintain the  proper airspeed and descent path throughout the approach  and the throttle retarded to idling position only after the  main wheels contact the landing surface. Care must be  exercised in not closing the throttle before the pilot is ready  for touchdown. In this situation, the sudden or premature  closing of the throttle may cause a sudden increase in the  descent rate that could result in a hard landing.  

Landings from power-on approaches in turbulence should  be such that the touchdown is made with the aircraft in  approximately level ﬂ  ight attitude. The pitch attitude at  touchdown should be only enough to prevent the nosewheel  from contacting the surface before the main wheels have  touched the surface. Most WSC are designed so the front  wheel is higher than the back wheels in this situation, but each  WSC is different. This must be evaluated for each model.  After touchdown, the pilot should reduce the throttle to idle  and pull the control bar all the way to the chest to lower the  nose and prevent the WSC aircraft from lifting off until it  slows below the stall speed. The aircraft should be allowed  to decelerate normally with the aerodynamic braking of the  wing with the nose lowered, and assisted by the wheel brakes  as required.  

# Crosswind Approaches and Landings  

Many runways or landing areas are made such that landings  must be made while the wind is blowing across rather than  parallel to the landing direction. All pilots should be prepared  to cope with these situations when they arise. The same basic  principles and factors involved in a normal and power-on  approach and landing apply to a crosswind approach and  landing; therefore, only the additional procedures required  for correcting for wind drift are discussed here.  

Crosswind approaches and landings are more challenging  than normal landings because of the wind drift in the pattern,  crab angles on approach, and generally more mechanical  turbulence for the ﬁ  nal approach and roundout because of  buildings and/or trees along the sides of the runway. Since  mechanical turbulence would typically increase as the aircraft  descends closer to the ground, power-on approaches and  techniques for ﬂ  ying in turbulence should be utilized.  

# Crosswind Pattern Procedures  

Since WSC aircraft typically ﬂ  y tighter patterns, the pattern  should be modiﬁ  ed if the crosswind is in a direction pushing  the WSC aircraft toward the runway. Refer to  Figure 11-24   for the following discussion. The normal or typical pattern  downwind and base for calm winds is shown in blue.  This pattern would also be used if there were an opposite  crosswind from that shown blowing from the runway toward  the base leg. If a strong crosswind (15 knots as an example,  which is a limitation for many WSC) is noticed while ﬂ  ying  the down wind or the runway wind indicators show this  crosswind, at “A” the decision should be made to modify  the pattern, making it wider by ﬂ  ying out to location “B.”  An extended downwind should then be made farther than  the typical normal pattern to “C.” This provides additional  distance from the runway for the base leg, which will be at a  much higher groundspeed than normal because the WSC is  ﬂ  ying in a strong tailwind from point “C” to “D.” The turn  must be made at “D” to set up for ﬁ  nal approach at “E” where  there is a signiﬁ  cant crab angle. From the ﬁ  nal approach at  “E” to touchdown, the pilot has sufﬁ  cient time to establish  the ground track in the center of the runway and evaluate if  the landing should be completed, a go-around performed,  or a different landing location selected with more favorable  wind conditions.  

# Effects and Hazards of High Crosswinds for  Approaches and Landings  

Figure 11-24  illustrates a scenario that includes the effects  and hazards of high wind, referencing groundspeed, high  rates of turn, and power requirements for making downwind  turns in close proximity to the ground.  

During the downwind leg of the pattern, the pilot does not  notice the strong wind blowing the WSC aircraft into the  runway. From points A to W, the pilot reduces power as  normal but does not crab into the wind and drifts with the  wind toward the runway between points A and W. This leads  the pilot to be closer to the runway when he or she turns  onto base. The pilot turns onto base and is traveling at high  groundspeed and the strong tailwind leads to the pilot passing  the runway centerline normal ﬁ  nal approach at point X. From  points X to Y, the pilot starts the turn for ﬁ  nal approach late  because of the high groundspeed. The WSC aircraft past the  runway centerline leads the pilot to increase the bank to make  it back to the centerline. The previous errors lead the pilot  into a high bank angle at low altitude pointed down in a rapid  descent. This leads the pilot to apply full power at Y, which  drives the WSC aircraft into ground at point Z.  

The error chain that led to this accident could have been  avoided at two primary points. First, the pilot should have  noticed ﬂ  ying in a crosswind or indications of a strong  crosswind on the runway from airport wind indicators at  A. He or she should have then widened the pattern into the  crosswind from A to B and performed the recommended  crosswind procedure described earlier.  

Second, if the pilot did not realize the high wind blowing to  the runway until point X was reached, the wings should have  been leveled and a go-around performed without trying to  “make it” back to the runway as shown in the yellow “go- around” path shown on  Figure 11-24.  

For strong crosswinds beyond the capabilities of the pilot  or limitations of the WSC aircraft, an alternate landing strip  should be found. This could be another airport or landing strip  that faces into the wind. An option at uncontrolled airports  is to choose an alternate runway or even a taxiway that faces  into the wind. Some of the larger airports with wide runways  make it possible to land at an angle if needed; some are wide  enough to land across the main runway. At towered airports,  the air trafﬁ  c controller can assist the pilot and provide an  alternate landing area if requested.

Figure 11-24.   Crosswind procedures and effects/hazards of high crosswinds.  

# Crosswind Landings  

When in ﬁ  nal approach, the wind correction angle (crab  angle) is established by heading toward the wind with the  wings level so that the aircraft’s ground track remains aligned  with the centerline of the runway.  [Figure 11-25]  This crab  angle is maintained all the way to touchdown, when the rear  wheels hit ﬁ  rst and rotate the carriage and wing around so  the front wheel touches the ground with the carriage going  straight. However, if in turbulent air or pitched forward  during the touchdown, with the front wheel touching the  ground ﬁ  rst, the pilot should lightly control the steering of  the front wheel to be headed in the direction the carriage is  going. WSC carriage front landing gear typically has camber  that tends to steer the front wheel naturally in the direction  of travel, so a light touch on the front wheel as it touches  the ground allows it to ﬁ  nd its own direction of travel. Once  the front wheel is on the ground, lower the nose to keep the  WSC on the ground and steer as required down the center  of the runway.  

The procedure for the wing during the roundout is the same  as that for normal and turbulent roundout and touchdowns.  The exception is that after touchdown the windward wing  should be lowered slightly so the wind cannot get under it to  ﬂ  ip the WSC aircraft during later landing roll and taxi.  

# Maximum Crosswind Velocities  

Takeoffs and landings in certain crosswind conditions are  inadvisable and even dangerous.  [Figure 11-26]  If the  crosswind is great enough, a hazardous landing condition  may result. Therefore, takeoff and landing capabilities with  respect to the reported surface wind conditions and available  landing directions must be considered.  

WSC crosswind limitations have been tested and are included  in the POH. The headwind and crosswind components for a  given situation can be determined by reference to a crosswind  component chart.  [Figure 11-27]  It is imperative that pilots  determine the maximum crosswind component of each aircraft  ﬂ  own and avoid operations in wind conditions that exceed the  capability of the aircraft. The automatic weather observation  system (AWOS) or automatic surface observation system  (ASOS) at airports is useful in determining the measured  velocity for this evaluation.  

Common errors in the performance of crosswind approaches  and landings include:  

•  Failure to recognize a strong crosswind blowing at the  runway during the downwind leg;

•   Failure to modify the pattern for strong crosswind  conditions;

 •   Failure to do a go-around when the ﬁ  nal approach to  the runway is downwind of the runway centerline;

 •   Attempting to land in crosswinds that exceed the pilot’s  capabilities;

 •   Attempting to land in crosswinds that exceed  the aircraft’s maximum demonstrated crosswind  component;  

•   Inadequate compensation for wind drift on the  turn from base leg to ﬁ  nal approach, resulting in  undershooting or overshooting; •   Inadequate compensation for wind drift on final  approach; •   Unstabilized approach; •   Touchdown while drifting; •  Excessive pressure on the nosewheel steering during  touchdown; •   Excessive airspeed on touchdown; •   Failure to apply appropriate ﬂ  ight control inputs during  rollout; •   Failure to maintain direction control on rollout; and •   Excessive braking.  

# Steep Approaches  

A steep approach is a valuable maneuver for WSC aircraft.  [Figure 11-28]  It is better to be too high for an approach  rather than too low for an approach in case the engine fails. A  steep approach can be used to reach the landing point easily;  if too low, the aircraft lands short. Steep approaches are used  routinely by many pilots to help ensure making the landing  point if the engine fails.  

![](images/4e3776b3960a9dd27f5ebbb838647fda4f552bd3ff46a280f3ca173085b14785.jpg)  
Figure 11-28.   Pilot view of runway where a steep approach would  be required.  

The two types of procedures (or a combination thereof) used  are based on the angle of descent required. To perform a steep  approach, evaluation of the situation considers the angle of  descent required to land at or within 400 feet of a speciﬁ  ed  point in which the steep angle or alternating turns are utilized.  For all steep approaches, the throttle is brought to idle.  

# Steep Angle  

For situations in which an increase in the descent angle is  needed for the intended landing spot, the normal procedure  is to increase speed above the best   $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{D}}$   speed in order to  descend. The greater the speed is, the greater the parasitic  drag and descent angle.  

Each design has different descent rates based on the parasitic  drag of the wing and carriage. For example, a single surface  with an exposed crossbar wing and a stick carriage (no  streamlined cowling) increases the descent angle quickly  because of the dramatic increases in drag with increased  speed. A double surface wing with a streamlined carriage  does not develop parasitic drag as fast with increased speed  and is less able to achieve a steep angle with increased speed.  The pilot should understand that this characteristic is unique  to the make/model being ﬂ  own. This steep angle technique is  the optimum steep approach procedure because the aircraft  is lined up on the runway and the pilot can easily judge the  glideslope using the stabilized approach method covered  earlier.  [Figure 11-29]  

Increase speed as required to obtain the descent angle for  the intended touchdown point. Use the stabilized approach  technique to obtain the increased angle for the aiming  point. At the higher speeds and greater descent, slow to the  normal approach speed, intersect the normal ﬁ  nal approach  path, and perform the landing required for that particular  situation (calm air/crosswinds/turbulent air). As the student  gains proﬁ  ciency at steep approach techniques, the altitude  to transition from the high speed steep angle to the normal  approach speed can be lowered and eventually combined  into one continuous roundout for landing started at a higher  altitude than the normal approach and roundout. For this  situation, note that with the increased speed the roundout  covers additional distance that should be accounted for as  the speed is decreased.  

# Alternating Turns  

If at a height at which a steep approach is necessary, but  the aircraft is too high to obtain an angle steep enough to  make the intended landing area, alternating turns can be  made to decrease altitude to a point at which the steep angle  technique could be applied for the remainder of the descent.  These alternating turns should be performed no lower than  400 feet above ground level (AGL). The turns should be  an equal distance from the runway centerline extension to  keep track and maintain the relative position on the runway  centerline. The bank and direction of turns across the runway  centerline should be determined by how much altitude must  be lost to position the WSC aircraft for utilization of the steep  angle technique for the remainder of the steep approach, if  required.  [Figure 11-30]  

# Power-Off Accuracy Approaches  

Power-off accuracy approaches are made by gliding with  the engine idling through a speciﬁ  c pattern to a touchdown  beyond and within 200 feet of a designated line or mark on  the runway. The objective is to instill in the pilot the judgment  and knowledge of procedures necessary for accurate ﬂ  ight,  without power, to a safe landing. This simulates procedures  for an emergency engine-out situation. The ability to estimate  the distance an aircraft glides to a landing is the real basis of  all power-off accuracy approaches and landings. This largely  determines the amount of maneuvering that may be done from  a given altitude. In addition to the ability to estimate distance,  the ability to maintain the proper glide while maneuvering  the aircraft is required.  

![](images/c6225ea2a3d6a701c209c471db4f072745c553c57a7eb2c63e27c8ac4d2ca299.jpg)

Figure 11-30.   Alternating turns used if too high to lose enough altitude to position for a normal or steep-angle approach.  

With experience and practice, altitudes up to approximately  1,000 feet can be estimated with fair accuracy, while above  this level the accuracy in judgment of height above the  ground decreases since features tend to merge. The best aid  in perfecting the ability to judge height above this altitude is  altimeter indications and associating them with the general  appearance of the Earth.  

The judgment of altitude in feet, hundreds of feet, or thousands  of feet is not as important as the ability to estimate gliding  angle and its resultant distance. The pilot who knows the  normal glide angle of the aircraft can estimate with reasonable  accuracy the approximate spot along a given ground path  at which the aircraft lands, regardless of altitude. The pilot  who also has the ability to estimate altitude accurately can  judge how much maneuvering is possible during the glide,  which is important to the choice of landing areas in an actual  emergency.  

Unlike a normal approach in which power is available when  needed, for a power-off approach the power is ﬁ  xed at the  idle setting. Pitch attitude is adjusted to control the airspeed,  which also changes the glide or descent angle. As discussed  in the basic ﬂ  ight maneuvers descents and the steep approach  maneuver, lowering the nose to a speed above the best glide  angle causes the descent angle to steepen. If the airspeed is  too high, raise the nose, and when the airspeed is too low,  lower the nose. If the pitch attitude is raised too high, the  aircraft settles rapidly due to low airspeed and insufﬁ  cient  lift. For this reason, never try to stretch a glide to reach the  desired landing spot.  

Uniform approach patterns such as the   $90^{\circ}$  ,   $180^{\circ}$  , or   $360^{\circ}$  power-off approaches are described further in this chapter.  Practice in these approaches provides the pilot with a basis  on which to develop judgment in gliding distance and in  planning an approach. The   $180^{\circ}$   power-off approach from  pattern altitude should be the normal landing procedure in  calm winds. This should become routine and develop the  ability to accurately judge the landing for an engine-out  situation. Remember, the steep approach technique can  always be used if the aircraft is a little high, but do not stretch  a glide by lowering the speed if too low.  

The basic procedure in these approaches involves closing  the throttle at a given altitude and gliding to a key position.  This position, like the pattern itself, must not be allowed to  become the primary objective; it is merely a convenient point  in the air from which the pilot can judge whether the glide  safely terminates at the desired spot. The selected key position  should be one that is appropriate for the available altitude  and the wind condition. From the key position, the pilot must  constantly evaluate the situation. It must be emphasized that,  although accurate spot touchdowns are important, safe and  properly executed approaches and landings are vital. The  pilot must never sacriﬁ  ce a good approach or landing just to  land on the desired spot.  

All power-off approaches must be practiced to avoid  interfering with normal trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ow at busy airports, so the  place and timing must be evaluated by the instructor to  prevent airport trafﬁ  c conﬂ  icts. This is especially important  for the  $360^{\circ}$   power-off approach.  

# 90° Power-Off Approach  

The   $90°$   power-off approach is made from a base leg and  requires only a  $90°$   turn onto the ﬁ  nal approach. The approach  path may be varied by positioning the base leg closer to or  farther away from the approach end of the runway according  to wind conditions.  [Figure 11-31]  The glide from the key  

![](images/bdc5ba6873ba28b3515c624bd16d06fd84fce1e702403ad27f8fb49fe4870b98.jpg)  
Figure 11-31.   Plan the base leg according to wind conditions.  

position on the base leg through the   $90^{\circ}$   turn to the ﬁ  nal  approach is the ﬁ  nal part of all accuracy landing maneuvers.  Steep approach procedures may be used during the ﬁ  nal  approach if needed.  

The  $90°$   power-off approach usually begins from a rectangular  pattern below normal pattern altitude as long as this point is  above 500 feet AGL. The before-landing checklist should  be completed on the downwind leg.  

After a medium-banked turn onto the base leg is completed  and key position obtained, the throttle should be completely  reduced to idle and the airspeed set to approach speed.  [Figure   $_{I I-32J}$   At this position, the intended landing spot  appears to be on a  $45^{\circ}$   angle from the aircraft’s nose.  

The pilot can determine the strength and direction of the  wind from the amount of crab necessary to hold the desired  ground track on the base leg. This helps in planning the turn  onto the ﬁ  nal approach. The base-to-ﬁ  nal turn should be  planned and accomplished so that upon rolling out of the  turn the aircraft is aligned with the runway centerline. Slight  adjustments in pitch attitude may be necessary to control  the glide angle and airspeed. However, never try to stretch  the glide to reach the desired landing spot. After the ﬁ  nal  approach glide has been established, full attention is given  to making a good, safe landing rather than concentrating on  the selected landing spot. In any event, it is better to execute  a good landing 200 feet from the spot than to make a poor  landing precisely on the spot.  

# 180° Power-Off Approach  

The   $180^{\circ}$   power-off approach is executed by gliding with  the power off from a given point on a downwind leg to a  preselected landing spot.  [Figure 11-33]  It is an extension  of the principles involved in the   $90^{\circ}$   power-off approach  just described. Its objective is to further develop judgment  in estimating distances and glide ratios, in that the aircraft  is ﬂ  own without power from a higher altitude and through  a  $90^{\circ}$   turn to reach the base-leg position at a proper altitude  for executing the   $90°$   approach.  

The   $180^{\circ}$   power-off approach requires more planning and  judgment than the  $90°$   power-off approach. In the execution  of   $180^{\circ}$   power-off approaches, the aircraft is ﬂ  own on a  downwind heading parallel to the landing runway. The  altitude from which this type of approach should be started  in the downwind leg is at a normal pattern altitude. This  power-off approach should be the normal procedure except  for normal light wind landings, the throttle can be brought  back to idle between the downwind leg key position and the  turn onto the base leg depending on the height and distance  from the runway. When abreast of or opposite the desired  landing spot or a location closer to the turn onto base if the  WSC is further from the runway, the throttle should be closed  and the WSC aircraft set to the best glide speed. The point at  which the throttle is closed is the downwind key position.

Figure 11-33.    $I80^{\circ}$   power-off approach example.  

The turn from the downwind leg to the base leg should be  a uniform turn with a medium or slightly steeper bank. The  degree of bank and amount of this initial turn depends upon  the glide angle of the aircraft and the velocity of the wind.  Again, the base leg should be positioned as needed for the  altitude or wind condition. Position the base leg to conserve  or dissipate altitude to reach the desired landing spot. The  turn onto the base leg should be made at an altitude high  enough and close enough to permit the aircraft to glide  to what would normally be the base key position in a   $90^{\circ}$  power-off approach.  

Although the key position is important, it must not be  overemphasized or considered as a ﬁ  xed point on the ground.  Many inexperienced pilots have the false understanding of it  as a particular landmark, such as a tree, crossroad, or other  visual reference to be reached at a certain altitude. This leaves  the pilot at a total loss any time such objects are not present.  Both altitude and geographical location should be varied as  much as practical to eliminate any such conception. After  reaching the base key position, the approach and landing are  the same as in the  $90^{\circ}$   power-off approach.  

# 360° Power-Off Approach  

The   $360^{\circ}$   power-off approach is one in which the aircraft  glides through a  $360^{\circ}$   change of direction to the preselected  landing spot. The entire pattern is designed to be circular  but the turn may be shallowed, steepened, or discontinued at  any point to adjust the accuracy of the ﬂ  ightpath. The  $360^{\circ}$  approach is started from a position over the approach end of  the landing runway or slightly to the side of it, with the aircraft  headed in the proposed landing direction.  [Figure 11-34]  It  is usually initiated from approximately 2,000 feet or more  above the ground—where the wind may vary signiﬁ  cantly  from that at lower altitudes. This must be taken into account  when maneuvering the aircraft to a point from which a  $90^{\circ}$  or   $180^{\circ}$   power-off approach can be completed.  

After the throttle is closed over the intended point of landing,  the proper glide speed should immediately be established and  a medium-banked turn made in the desired direction to arrive  at the downwind reference position opposite the intended  landing spot. The altitude at the downwind reference position  should be approximately 1,000 feet above the ground. After  reaching that point, the turn should be continued to arrive at  a base-leg key position.  

The angle of bank can be varied as needed throughout the  pattern to correct for wind conditions and to align the aircraft  with the ﬁ  nal approach. The turn to ﬁ  nal should be completed  at a minimum altitude of 300 feet above the terrain.  

Common errors in the performance of power-off accuracy  approaches include:  

•   Downwind leg too far from the runway/landing  area;  

![](images/826788709c0fd2193c1a18c007ac2cea2f2d23de10d1ad1eaaa92ecc1cf3a033.jpg)  
Figure 11-34.   360° power-off approach.  

•   Overextension of downwind leg resulting from  tailwind;  

•   Inadequate compensation for wind drift on base leg; •   Attempting to “stretch” the glide during undershoot;  •   Forcing the aircraft onto the runway in order to avoid  overshooting the designated landing spot.  

# Emergency Approaches and Landings  (  Simulated Engine Out)  

From time to time on dual ﬂ  ights, the instructor should  give surprise simulated emergency landings by retarding  the throttle and calling “simulated emergency landing.”  The objective of these simulated emergency landings is to  develop pilot accuracy, judgment, planning, procedures, and  conﬁ  dence.  

When the instructor calls “simulated emergency landing,”  the pilot should immediately establish the best glide speed  and the aircraft trimmed (if so equipped) to maintain that  speed.  

A constant gliding speed should initially be maintained  because variations of gliding speed nullify all attempts at  accuracy in judgment of gliding distance and the landing  spot. The many variables, such as altitude, obstruction, wind  direction, landing direction, landing surface and gradient, and  landing distance requirements of the aircraft determine the  pattern and approach procedures to use.  

Utilizing any combination of normal gliding maneuvers,  from wings level to steep turns, the pilot should eventually  arrive at the normal reference position at a normal trafﬁ  c  pattern altitude for the selected landing area. From this point  on, the approach is as nearly as possible a normal power-off  approach as described previously in the Power-off Accuracy  Approaches section. Steep approach techniques may be used  for ﬁ  nal approach if required.  

If the student is high above the desired emergency landing  area, large low-banked circles above the area should be made  and widened or narrowed as required to provide downwind  and ﬁ  nal reference points for the landing.  [Figure 11-35]  

Despite the greater choice of fields afforded by higher  altitudes, the inexperienced pilot may be inclined to delay  making a decision and, despite considerable altitude in which  to maneuver, errors in maneuvering and estimation of glide  distance may develop.  

All pilots should learn to determine the wind direction and  estimate its speed from any means available. This could be a  feel of the wind drift on the WSC, GPS ground speed versus  true airspeed, and visual indicators such as the windsock at  

![](images/5d89b783affc45957b79af89184f14bab7b3e9a78b4f8c82be6ec1cede9a491c.jpg)

the airport, smoke from factories or houses, dust, ﬁ  res, ﬂ  ags,  ripples on water surfaces, and windmills.  

Once a ﬁ  eld has been selected, the student pilot should  always be required to indicate it to the instructor. Normally,  the student should be required to plan and ﬂ  y a pattern for  landing on the ﬁ  eld ﬁ  rst elected until the instructor terminates  the simulated emergency landing. This gives the instructor  an opportunity to explain and correct any errors; it also gives  the student an opportunity to see the results of the errors.  However, if the student realizes during the approach that  a poor ﬁ  eld has been selected—one that would obviously  result in disaster if a landing were to be made—and there is  a more advantageous ﬁ  eld within gliding distance, a change  to the better ﬁ  eld should be permitted. The hazards involved  in these last-minute decisions, such as excessive maneuvering  at very low altitudes, should be thoroughly explained by  the instructor. Steep approaches, varying the position of the  base leg, and varying the turn onto ﬁ  nal approach should be  stressed as ways of correcting for misjudgment of altitude  and glide angle.  

Eagerness to get down is one of the most common faults of  inexperienced pilots during simulated emergency landings.  In giving way to this, they forget about speed and arrive at  the edge of the ﬁ  eld with too much speed to permit a safe  landing. Too much speed may be just as dangerous as too  little; it results in excessive ﬂ  oating and overshooting the  desired landing spot. It should be impressed on the students  that they cannot dive at a ﬁ  eld and expect to land on it if it  is short.  

During all simulated emergency landings, the engine should  be kept warm and cleared. During a simulated emergency  landing, the student should have control of the foot throttle  and the instructor should have control of a second throttle.  The instructor should tell the student to increase the throttle  when needed, but the instructor should be ready with the  second throttle in case the student does not apply it as  required.  

Every simulated emergency landing approach should be  terminated as soon as it can be determined whether a safe  landing could have been made. In no case should it be  continued to a point where it creates an undue hazard or an  annoyance to persons or property on the ground.  

In addition to ﬂ  ying the aircraft from the point of simulated  engine failure to where a reasonable safe landing could be  made, the student should also be taught certain emergency  ﬂ  ight deck procedures. The habit of performing these ﬂ  ight  deck procedures should be developed to such an extent that,  when an engine failure actually occurs, the student checks  the critical items that would be necessary to get the engine  operating again while selecting a ﬁ  eld and planning an  approach. Combining the two operations—accomplishing  emergency procedures and planning and flying the  approach—is difﬁ  cult for the student during early training  in emergency landings.  

There are deﬁ  nite steps and procedures to be followed in  a simulated emergency landing. Although they may differ  somewhat from the procedures used in an actual emergency,  they should be learned thoroughly by the student and each  step called out to the instructor. The use of a checklist is  strongly recommended. Most aircraft manufacturers provide  a checklist of the appropriate items.  

Critical items to be checked should include the quantity of  fuel and the position of the magneto switch. Many actual  emergency landings could have been prevented if the pilots  had developed the habit of checking these critical items  during ﬂ  ight training to the extent that it carried over into  later ﬂ  ying.  

# Faulty Approaches and Landings  

# Low Final Approach  

When the base leg is too low, insufﬁ  cient power is used, or  the velocity of the wind is misjudged, sufﬁ  cient altitude may  be lost, which causes the aircraft to be well below the proper  ﬁ  nal approach path. In such a situation, the pilot would need  to apply considerable power to maintain or gain altitude as  required to ﬂ  y the aircraft (at an excessively low altitude)  up to the runway threshold. When the proper approach path  has been intercepted, the correct approach attitude should be  reestablished, the power reduced, and a stabilized approach  maintained.  [Figure 11-36]  Do not increase the pitch attitude  without increasing the power since the aircraft decelerates  rapidly and may approach the critical AOA and stall. If there  is any doubt about the approach being safely completed, it is  advisable to execute an immediate go-around.  

# High Final Approach  

When the ﬁ  nal approach is too high, perform a steep approach  as required for the height above the landing spot. Refer to the  steep approach section earlier in this chapter.  

# Slow Final Approach  

When the aircraft is ﬂ  own at slower-than-normal airspeed  on the ﬁ  nal approach, pilot determination of the rate of sink  (descent) and the height of roundout is difﬁ  cult. During an  excessively slow approach, the wing is operating near the  critical AOA and, depending on the pitch attitude changes  and control usage, the aircraft may stall or sink rapidly and  contact the ground with a hard impact.  

![](images/14dae2d89608d3a121d60a657a16002acaf4c82552cc3d944a6c6bf6960781de.jpg)  
Figure 11-36.   Right and wrong methods of correction for low final approach.  

Whenever a low-speed approach is noted, the pilot should  apply power and accelerate the aircraft to reduce the sink rate  to prevent a stall. This should be done while still at a high  enough altitude to reestablish the correct approach airspeed  and attitude. If too slow and too low, it is best to execute a  go-around.  

# Use of Power  

Power can be used if required during the approach and  roundout to compensate for errors in judgment. The pilot  should be ready to use the foot throttle while managing the  energy throughout the landing, utilizing energy management  procedures for the current landing conditions. Power can be  added to reduce the descent rate if needed; thus, the descent  can be slowed to an acceptable rate. After the aircraft has  touched down, it is necessary to close the throttle to remove  additional thrust and lift allowing the aircraft to stay on the  ground.  

# High Roundout  

Sometimes when the aircraft appears to stop moving downward  temporarily, the roundout has been made too rapidly and the  aircraft is ﬂ  ying level, too high and too slow above the runway.  Continuing the roundout would further reduce the airspeed,  resulting in an increase in AOA to the critical angle. This  would result in the aircraft stalling and dropping hard onto  the runway. To prevent the hard drop, pitch attitude should  be reduced slightly to increase speed to approach speed while  throttle is added to maintain altitude. After speed has been  increased and altitude maintained, the throttle and speed can  both be reduced smoothly and gradually for a gradual descent  with a normal roundout and touchdown.  

Although speed is needed after the high roundout is noticed in  order to be corrected, the power application must be enough to  remain level and not initially descend as the speed is increased.  Energy management proﬁ  ciency is critical. If too little throttle  is added, the momentary decrease in lift that would result  from lowering the nose and decreasing the AOA may be  so great that the aircraft might contact the ground with the  nosewheel ﬁ  rst, which could then collapse. As for all landing  maneuvers that are questionable and the outcome is uncertain,  it is recommended that a go-around be executed.  

# Late or Rapid Roundout  

Starting the roundout too late or pushing the control forward  too rapidly to prevent the aircraft from touching down  prematurely balloons the aircraft up above the runway.  Suddenly increasing the AOA and stalling the aircraft during  a roundout is a dangerous situation since it may cause the  aircraft to land extremely hard on the main landing gear and  then bounce back into the air.  

Recovery from this situation requires prompt and positive  application of power and a lowering of the nose to increase  speed prior to occurrence of the stall. This may be followed  by a normal landing, if sufﬁ  cient runway is available, similar  to the high roundout discussed above—otherwise the pilot  should immediately execute a go-around.  

# Floating During Roundout  

If the airspeed on ﬁ  nal approach is excessive, it usually results  in the aircraft ﬂ  oating in ground effect. This is not a problem  if there is plenty of runway and if the pilot ﬂ  oats with the  wheels just inches above the surface. Simply maintain this  position inches above the runway, slowly rounding out as  required until the speed bleeds off for a normal touchdown.  If conditions are turbulent, the nose can be lowered gradually  and the aircraft ﬂ  own onto the ground, as discussed earlier  in the landing in turbulence procedures.  

If the aircraft is well past the desired landing point and  the available runway is insufﬁ  cient, perform a go-around  immediately.  

# Ballooning During Roundout  

If the pilot misjudges the rate of sink during a landing and  thinks the aircraft is descending faster than it should, there  is a tendency to increase the pitch attitude and AOA too  rapidly. This not only stops the descent, but actually starts  the aircraft climbing. This climbing during the roundout is  known as ballooning. Ballooning can be dangerous because  the height above the ground is increasing and the aircraft may  be rapidly approaching a stall. The altitude gained in each  instance depends on the airspeed or the speed with which the  pitch attitude is increased.  

When ballooning is slight, the nose should be lowered to  increase speed and return to a gradual descent. Recovery  procedures are similar to those for rounding out too high:  lowering the nose slightly and increasing the throttle to  remain level. Then, the pilot gradually reduces throttle and  speed for a controlled descent rate with the throttle at idle  during touchdown.  

When ballooning is excessive, it is best to execute a go- around immediately; do not attempt to salvage the landing.  Full power must be applied and the nose lowered before the  aircraft enters a stalled condition.  

The pilot must be extremely cautious of ballooning when  there is a crosswind present because the crosswind correction  may be inadvertently released or it may become inadequate.  Because of the lower airspeed after ballooning, the crosswind  affects the aircraft more. Consequently, crabbing has to  be increased to compensate for the increased drift. It is  imperative that the pilot makes certain that directional control  is maintained. If there is any doubt, or the aircraft starts to  drift, execute a go-around.  

# Bouncing During Touchdown  

When the aircraft contacts the ground with a sharp impact  as the result of an improper attitude or an excessive rate  of sink, it can bounce back into the air. The severity of the  bounce depends on the airspeed at the moment of contact  and the rebound attitude the WSC aircraft. It can increase the  AOA and, in addition to bouncing, be lifted. It can rebound  in a yawed condition and/or nose up or down. Design and  situational factors create their own unique scenarios.  

The corrective action for a bounce is the same as for  ballooning and similarly depends on its severity. When the  bounce is very slight and there is not an extreme change in the  aircraft’s pitch attitude, a follow-up landing may be executed  by applying sufﬁ  cient power to cushion the subsequent  touchdown and smoothly adjusting the pitch to the proper  touchdown attitude.  

Extreme caution and attention must be exercised any time a  bounce occurs, but particularly when there is a crosswind.  During the bounce, the wind causes the aircraft to roll with  the wind, thus exposing even more surface to the crosswind  and drifting the aircraft more rapidly.  

When a bounce is severe, the safest procedure is to execute  a go-around immediately. No attempt to salvage the landing  should be made. Full power should be applied while  simultaneously maintaining directional control and lowering  the nose to a safe climb attitude. The go-around procedure  should be continued even though the aircraft may descend and  another bounce may be encountered. It would be extremely  foolish to attempt a landing from a bad bounce since airspeed  diminishes very rapidly in the nose-high attitude, and a stall  may occur before a subsequent touchdown could be made.  

# Porpoising  

In a bounced landing that is improperly recovered, the  aircraft comes in nose ﬁ  rst, setting off a series of motions that  imitate the jumps and dives of a porpoise—hence the name.  The problem is improper aircraft attitude at touchdown,  sometimes caused by inattention, not knowing where the  ground is, or forcing the aircraft onto the runway at an  exceedingly high descent rate.  

Porpoising can also be caused by improper airspeed control.  Usually, if an approach is too fast, the aircraft ﬂ  oats and the  pilot tries to force it on the runway when the aircraft still tends  to ﬂ  y. A gust of wind, a bump in the runway, or even a slight  push on the control bar sends the aircraft aloft again.  

The corrective action for a porpoise is the same as for a  bounce, and similarly depends on its severity. When it is very  slight with no extreme change in the aircraft’s pitch attitude,  a follow-up landing may be executed by applying sufﬁ  cient  power to cushion the subsequent touchdown, and smoothly  adjusting the pitch to the proper touchdown attitude.  

When a porpoise is severe, the safest procedure is to execute  an immediate go-around. In a severe porpoise, the aircraft’s  pitch oscillations can become progressively worse until the  aircraft strikes the runway nose ﬁ  rst with sufﬁ  cient force  to collapse the nose gear. Pilot attempts to correct a severe  porpoise with ﬂ  ight control and power inputs will most  likely be untimely and out of sequence with the oscillations,  only making the situation worse. No attempt to salvage the  landing should be made. Full power should be applied while  simultaneously maintaining directional control and lowering  the nose to a safe climb attitude.  

# Wing Rising After Touchdown  

In all the proper landing techniques except the soft ﬁ  eld, the  nose is lowered after the front wheel touches to put a negative  AOA on the wing and keep the WSC aircraft on the ground.  However, there may be instances when landing in a crosswind  that a wing wants to rise during the after-landing roll. This  may occur whether or not there is a loss of directional control  depending on the amount of crosswind and the degree of  corrective action.  

Any time an aircraft is rolling on the ground in a crosswind  condition, the upwind wing is receiving a greater force  from the wind than the downwind wing. This causes a lift  differential. Also, as the upwind wing rises, there is an  increase in the AOA which increases lift on the upwind wing  rolling the aircraft downwind.  

When the effects of these two factors are great enough, the  upwind wing may rise even though directional control is  maintained. If no correction is applied, it is possible that the  upwind wing rises sufﬁ  ciently to cause the downwind wing  to strike the ground.  

In a crosswind, the windward wing should be lowered  slightly as a preventive measure to avoid it from lifting. But  in the event a wing starts to rise during the landing roll, the  pilot should immediately lower the nose while lowering the  wing. The wing should be lowered as soon as possible. The  further a wing is allowed to rise before taking corrective  action, the more wing surface is exposed to the force of the  crosswind.  

# Hard Landing  

When the aircraft contacts the ground during landings, its  vertical speed is instantly reduced to zero. Unless provisions  are made to slow this vertical speed and cushion the impact  of touchdown, the force of contact with the ground may be  so great it could cause structural damage to the aircraft.  

The purpose of pneumatic tires, shock-absorbing landing  gears, and other devices is to cushion the impact and to  increase the time in which the aircraft’s vertical descent is  stopped. The importance of this cushion may be understood  from the computation that a 6-inch free fall on landing is  roughly equal to a descent of 340 feet per minute. Within a  fraction of a second, the aircraft must be slowed from this  rate of vertical descent to zero without damage.  

During this time, the landing gear together with some aid from  the lift of the wings must supply whatever force is needed  to counteract the force of the aircraft’s inertia and weight.  The lift decreases rapidly as the aircraft’s forward speed is  decreased and the force on the landing gear increases by the  impact of touchdown. When the descent stops, the lift is  almost zero leaving only the landing gear to carry both aircraft  weight and inertia force. The load imposed at the instant  of touchdown may easily be three or four times the actual  weight of the aircraft, depending on the severity of contact.  After a hard landing, the WSC carriage and wing should be  inspected by qualiﬁ  ed personnel for airworthiness.  

# Chapter Summary  

All landings should consist of evaluating the wind and  conditions so a proper base and ﬁ  nal are planned to land at  or beyond the intended point. After the ﬁ  nal approach to the  runway, the roundout is started about 10 to 15 feet high and  is a gradual descent until the rear wheels are inches above  the surface. The rotation is continued as the speed bleeds off  to maintain the wheels one to two inches above the runway  until minimum controlled airspeed at which the WSC aircraft  settles to the ground. A roundout that is too fast, or ballooning  where altitude is gained during the landing, is a common  mistake and should be avoided.  

The best landing technique for light wind conditions is with  power brought to idle during the downwind leg of the pattern  before the turn to base. Proﬁ  ciency in power-off accuracy  landings with  $90^{\circ}$   turns,  $180^{\circ}$   turns,  $360^{\circ}$   turns, and circling  from above are all important safety procedures.  

Crosswinds or landing in turbulence requires more energy,  including power-on approaches with higher airspeeds.  In these conditions, the WSC aircraft can be ﬂ  own into  the ground above the stall speed. Go-arounds are normal  procedures and should be performed if there is any question  as to the successful outcome of any landing.  

# Chapter 12 Night Operations  

# Introduction  

It must be understood that ﬂ  ying at night presents a number  of new challenges for the pilot and additional equipment for  the aircraft. Flying at night in a weight-shift control (WSC)  aircraft should be done only with some visual reference  to the ground such as city lights or a full moon. Flying  with no consistent visual reference to the surface results in  disorientation, a likely loss of control, and an accident. New  WSC aircraft can be ﬁ  tted with instruments similar to those  in airplanes in order to ﬂ  y at night without visual reference  to the horizon, but this is not recommended. However, ﬂ  ying  with instruments is covered in this chapter.  

# Pilot Requirements  

Flying at night requires additional pilot skills and a private  pilot certiﬁ  cate. It is possible to have a private pilot certiﬁ  cate  with a “Night Flight Prohibited” limitation if the pilot did  not complete night ﬂ  ight training and is restricted from night  ﬂ  ight, similar to that for Sport Pilots. This is an option for  pilots who want a private pilot certiﬁ  cate but do not plan to  ﬂ  y at night. If the pilot ﬁ  rst obtains the private certiﬁ  cate  with the night limitation, the limitation can be removed after  completing the private pilot WSC night training. The training  that must be accomplished at night for WSC private pilot  night ﬂ  ying privileges is:  

1.  One cross-country ﬂ  ight over 75 nautical miles (NM)  total distance, and  

2.  Ten takeoffs and landings (each landing involving a  ﬂ  ight in the trafﬁ  c pattern) at an airport.  

Sport pilots or private pilots with the night limitation are not  allowed to ﬂ  y at night; however, they can ﬂ  y after sunset  during civil twilight until night if the aircraft is properly  equipped with position lights. Civil twilight is when the sun  is less than  $6^{\circ}$   below the horizon, about 30 minutes before  sunrise or after sunset, and varies by latitude throughout  the year. It is the time when there is enough light outdoors  for activities to be conducted without additional lighting.  [Figure 12-1]  If it is overcast and visibility is inadequate,  good pilot judgment would dictate not to ﬂ  y after sunset.  

# Equipment and Lighting  

Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 91  speciﬁ  es the minimum aircraft equipment required for ﬂ  ight  during civil twilight and night ﬂ  ight. This equipment includes  only position lights. Normal standard category aircraft are  required to have this additional equipment as would also be  recommended for WSC night ﬂ  ight, including anti-collision  light, landing lights, adequate electrical source for lights, and  spare fuses. The standard instruments required for instrument  ﬂ  ight under 14 CFR part 91 are a valuable asset for aircraft  control at night but are not required.  

Aircraft position lights are required on all aircraft from sunset  to sunrise in an arrangement similar to those on boats and  ships. A red light is positioned on the left wing tip, a green  light on the right wing tip, and a white light on the tail.  [Figures 12-2  and  12-3]  This arrangement allows the pilot  to determine the general direction of movement of other  aircraft in ﬂ  ight. If both position lights of another aircraft  are observed, a red light on the right and a green light on the  left, the aircraft is ﬂ  ying toward the pilot and could be on a  collision course. Similarly, a green light on the right and a  red light on the left indicate the aircraft is ﬂ  ying in the same  direction as the pilot observing the lights. Landing lights  are not only useful for taxi, takeoffs, and landings, but also  provide an additional means by which aircraft can be seen  at night by other pilots.  [Figure 12-4]  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated  a voluntary pilot safety program called “Operation Lights  On.” The “lights on” idea is to enhance the “see and be seen”  concept of averting collisions in the air and on the ground and  to reduce the potential for bird strikes. Pilots are encouraged  to turn on their landing lights when operating within 10 miles  of an airport. This is for both day and night or in conditions  of reduced visibility. This should also be done in areas where  ﬂ  ocks of birds may be expected.  

Although turning on aircraft lights supports the “see and be  seen” concept, pilots should not become complacent about  keeping a sharp lookout for other aircraft. Most aircraft lights  blend in with stars or city lights at night and go unnoticed

unless a conscious effort is made to distinguish them from  other lights.  

# Pilot Equipment  

Before beginning a night ﬂ  ight, carefully consider personal  equipment that should be readily available during the ﬂ  ight.  

![](images/c012fd678bde5d827c9fb73645c8e5648b67e780a37e35d0702cbe885f4bd8f7.jpg)  
Figure 12-3.  Modern LED position lights on carriage wheel pants  simplify the installation with no wires running from the carriage  to the wing tips.  

At least one reliable ﬂ  ashlight is recommended as standard  equipment on all night ﬂ  ights. Remember to place a spare  set of batteries in the ﬂ  ight kit. A spare ﬂ  ashlight is the better  choice, eliminating the need to change batteries during ﬂ  ight.  

![](images/57c9172f4216e79de3aaa7107a497a82d2d238e9c8dfaa76cdcbfb9c4bb96f70.jpg)  
Figure 12-4.  Landing light on WSC aircraft taxiing at night.  

A D-cell size ﬂ  ashlight with a bulb switching mechanism that  can be used for white or red light is preferable. The white light  is used while performing the preﬂ  ight visual inspection on  the ground, and the red light is used when performing ﬂ  ight  deck operations. Since the red light is nonglaring, it does not  impair night vision. Some pilots prefer two ﬂ  ashlights, one  with a white light for preﬂ  ight and the other a penlight with  a red light. The latter can be suspended by a string around  the neck to ensure the light is always readily available. Be  aware that if a red light is used for reading an aeronautical  chart, the red features of the chart will not show up.  

Aeronautical charts are essential for night cross-country ﬂ  ight  and, if the intended course is near the edge of the chart, the  adjacent chart should also be available. The lights of cities  and towns can be seen at surprising distances at night, and if  this adjacent chart is not available to identify those landmarks,  confusion could result. Regardless of the equipment used,  organization of the ﬂ  ight deck eases the burden on the pilot  and enhances safety.  [Figure 12-5]  

# Airport and Navigation Lighting Aids  

The lighting systems used for airports, runways, obstructions,  and other visual aids at night are other important aspects of  night ﬂ  ying.  

Lighted airports located away from congested areas can be  identiﬁ  ed readily at night by the lights outlining the runways.  Airports located near or within large cities are often difﬁ  cult  to identify in the maze of lights. It is important to know the  exact location of an airport relative to the city, and also be  able to identify these airports by the characteristics of their  lighting pattern.  

Aeronautical lights are designed and installed in a variety  of colors and conﬁ  gurations, each having its own purpose.  Although some lights are used only during low ceiling and  visibility conditions, this discussion includes only the lights  that are fundamental to visual flight rules (VFR) night  operation.  

It is recommended that prior to a night ﬂ  ight, and particularly  a cross-country night ﬂ  ight, the pilot check the availability  and status of lighting systems at the destination airport. This  information can be found on aeronautical charts and in the  Airport/Facility Directory (A/FD). The status of each facility  can be determined by reviewing pertinent Notices to Airmen  (NOTAMs).  

A rotating beacon is used to indicate the location of most  airports. The beacon rotates at a constant speed, thus  

![](images/c3d764695ffa855f492f5e24669deeccf693b933979f7874664044d75bf5dc64.jpg)

producing what appears to be a series of light ﬂ  ashes at  regular intervals. These ﬂ  ashes may be one or two different  colors that are used to identify various types of landing areas.  For example:  

•   Lighted civilian land airports—alternating white and  green •   Lighted civilian water airports—alternating white and  yellow •   Lighted military airports—alternating white and  green, but are differentiated from civil airports by  dual peaked (two quick) white ﬂ  ashes, then green  

Beacons producing red ﬂ  ashes indicate obstructions or areas  considered hazardous to aerial navigation. Steady burning  red lights are used to mark obstructions on or near airports  and sometimes to supplement ﬂ  ashing lights on en route  obstructions. High intensity ﬂ  ashing white lights are used to  mark some supporting structures of overhead transmission  lines that stretch across rivers, chasms, and gorges. These  high intensity lights are also used to identify tall structures,  such as chimneys and towers.  

As a result of technological advancements in aviation,  runway lighting systems have become quite sophisticated  to accommodate takeoffs and landings in various weather  conditions. However, the pilot whose ﬂ  ying is limited to VFR  needs to be concerned only with the following basic lighting  of runways and taxiways.  

The basic runway lighting system consists of two straight  parallel lines of runway-edge lights deﬁ  ning the lateral limits of  the runway. These lights are aviation white, although aviation  yellow may be substituted for a distance of 2,000 feet from  the far end of the runway to indicate a caution zone. At some  airports, the intensity of the runway-edge lights can be adjusted  to satisfy the individual needs of the pilot. The length limits  of the runway are deﬁ  ned by straight lines of lights across the  runway ends. At some airports, the runway threshold lights are  aviation green, and the runway end lights are aviation red.  

At many airports, the taxiways are also lighted. A taxiway-  edge lighting system consists of blue lights that outline  the usable limits of taxi paths. See the Pilot’s Handbook  of Aeronautical Knowledge for additional information on  airport lighting.  

# Night Vision  

eyes correctly and know their limitations, night vision can  be improved signiﬁ  cantly. The human eye is constructed so  that day vision is different from night vision. Therefore, it is  important to understand the eye’s construction and how the  eye is affected by darkness.  

Innumerable light-sensitive nerves called cones and rods are  located at the back of the eye or retina, a layer upon which all  images are focused. These nerves connect to the cells of the  optic nerve, which transmits messages directly to the brain.  The cones are located in the center of the retina, and the rods  are concentrated in a ring around the cones.  [Figure 12-6]  

The function of the cones is to detect color, details, and  faraway objects. The rods function when something is seen  out of the corner of the eye or peripheral vision. They detect  objects, particularly those that are moving, but do not give  detail or color—only shades of gray. Both the cones and the  rods are used for vision during daylight.  

Although there is not a clear-cut division of function, the rods  make night vision possible. The rods and cones function in  daylight and in moonlight; in the absence of normal light,  the process of night vision is almost entirely a function of  the rods.  

The fact that the rods are distributed in a band around the  cones and do not lie directly behind the pupils makes off- center viewing (looking to one side of an object) important  during night ﬂ  ight. During daylight, an object can be seen  best by looking directly at it, but at night a scanning procedure  to permit off-center viewing of the object is more effective.  Therefore, the pilot should consciously practice this scanning  procedure to improve night vision.  

The eye’s adaptation to darkness is another important aspect  of night vision. When a dark room is entered, it is difﬁ  cult to  see anything until the eyes become adjusted to the darkness.  In the adaptation process, the pupils of the eyes ﬁ  rst enlarge  to receive as much of the available light as possible. After  approximately 5 to 10 minutes, the cones become adjusted to  the dim light and the eyes become 100 times more sensitive  to light than they were before the dark room was entered.  About 30 minutes is needed for the rods to become adjusted  to darkness; when they do adjust, they are about 100,000  times more sensitive to light than in the lighted area. After  the adaptation process is complete, much more can be seen,  especially if the eyes are used correctly.  

Generally, most pilots are poorly informed about night vision.  Human eyes never function as effectively at night as the eyes  of nocturnal animals, but if humans learn how to use their  

![](images/fb8cc6990b7b2494233d9b0621baba0e5b963fc687368e4c7ffdd3b000a06c2c.jpg)  
Figure 12-6.   Rods and cones.  

After the eyes have adapted to the dark, the entire process  is reversed when entering a lighted room. The eyes are ﬁ  rst  dazzled by the brightness, but become completely adjusted  in a few seconds, thereby losing their adaptation to the dark.  Now, if the dark room is reentered, the eyes again go through  the long process of adapting to the darkness.  

Before and during night ﬂ  ight, the pilot must consider the  adaptation process of the eyes. First, the eyes should be  allowed to adapt to the low level of light. Then, the pilot  should avoid exposing them to any bright white light that  would cause temporary blindness and possibly result in  serious consequences.  

Temporary blindness, caused by an unusually bright light,  may result in illusions or afterimages until the eyes recover  from the brightness. The brain creates these illusions  reported by the eyes. This results in misjudging or incorrectly  identifying objects, such as mistaking slanted clouds for the  horizon or a populated area for a landing ﬁ  eld. Vertigo is  experienced as a feeling of dizziness and imbalance that can  create or increase illusions. The illusions seem very real and  pilots at every level of experience and skill can be affected.  Recognizing that the brain and eyes can play tricks in this  manner is the best protection for ﬂ  ying at night.  

Good eyesight depends upon physical condition. Fatigue,  colds, vitamin deﬁ  ciency, alcohol, stimulants, smoking, or  medication can seriously impair vision. Keeping these facts  in mind and taking appropriate precautions should help  safeguard night vision.  

In addition to the principles previously discussed, the following  actions aid in increasing night vision effectiveness:  

•   Adapt the eyes to darkness prior to ﬂ  ight, and keep  them adapted. About 30 minutes is needed to adjust  the eyes to maximum efﬁ  ciency after exposure to a  bright light. •   Use oxygen during night ﬂ  ying, if available. Keep in  mind that a signiﬁ  cant deterioration in night vision  can occur at altitudes as low as 5,000 feet. •   Close one eye when exposed to bright light to help  avoid the blinding effect. •   Avoid wearing sunglasses after sunset. •   Move the eyes more slowly than in daylight. •   Blink the eyes if vision becomes blurred. •   Concentrate on seeing objects. •   Force the eyes to view off center. •   Maintain good physical condition. •   Avoid smoking, drinking, and using drugs that may  be harmful.  

# Unique WSC Flight Characteristics  

If the WSC aircraft is trimmed properly and the pilot is  proﬁ  cient in the basic ﬂ  ight maneuvers of climbs, cruise,  and descent procedures, the WSC aircraft speed is easily  determined with control bar pressure and position for normal  ﬂ  ight conditions. A pilot can also determine basic climbs and  descents through the feel of the aircraft with the airspeed and  throttle positions. Therefore, basic pitch control can be done  by a proﬁ  cient pilot with his or her eyes closed.  

As discussed in Chapter 2, Aerodynamics, WSC aircraft  are generally not designed to be roll stable, and any engine  turning effect or movement of the air can put the WSC aircraft  into a roll, which it maintains unless corrected by the pilot.  In other words, releasing the control bar in a WSC aircraft  will not level a bank back to straight ﬂ  ight. The pilot must  continually provide input to ﬂ  y a constant heading even if this  control is small corrections. In other words, the pilot cannot  level the wings or ﬂ  y a straight heading for very long with  his or her eyes closed.  

To maintain a constant heading or ground track, one of  three instruments can be used: magnetic compass, global  positioning system (GPS), and aircraft heading indicator.  Without a visual reference, these can be used to ﬂ  y straight.  An attitude indicator can be used on WSC aircraft providing  additional instrument reference. These instruments and others  are discussed later in this chapter.  

# Night Illusions  

In addition to night vision limitations, pilots should be aware  that night illusions could cause confusion and concerns  during night ﬂ  ying. The following discussion covers some  of the common situations that cause illusions associated with  night ﬂ  ying.  

A false horizon can occur when the natural horizon is obscured  or not readily apparent. It can be generated by confusing  bright stars and city lights. It can also occur while ﬂ  ying  toward the shore of an ocean or a large lake. Because of the  relative darkness of the water, the lights along the shoreline  can be mistaken for stars in the sky.  [Figure 12-7]  

![](images/0c49dbd4c41b2b818678fe7671e8b48cc8ac853c60554d0e4157feac2997a511.jpg)  
Figure 12-7.  At night, the horizon may be hard to discern due to dark  terrain and misleading light patterns on the ground.  

On a clear night, distant stationary lights can be mistaken for  stars or other aircraft. Even the northern lights can confuse a  pilot and indicate a false horizon. Certain geometrical patterns  of ground lights, such as a freeway, runway, approach, or  even lights on a moving train can cause confusion. Dark  nights tend to eliminate reference to a visual horizon. As a  result, pilots need to rely less on outside references at night  and more on ﬂ  ight and navigation instruments.  

Visual autokinesis can occur when a pilot stares at a single  light source for several seconds on a dark night. The result  is that the light appears to be moving. The autokinesis effect  does not occur if the pilot expands the visual ﬁ  eld. It is a  good procedure to vary visual focus and not become ﬁ  xed  on one source of light.  

Distractions and problems can result from a flickering  light in the ﬂ  ight deck, such as anticollision lights, strobe  lights, or other aircraft lights which can cause flicker  vertigo. If continuous, the possible physical reactions can  be nausea, dizziness, grogginess, confusion, headaches, or  unconsciousness. The pilot should try to eliminate any light  source causing blinking or ﬂ  ickering problems in the ﬂ  ight  deck.  

A   black-hole approach occurs when the landing is made  from over water or unlighted terrain on which runway lights  are the only sources of light. Without peripheral visual cues  to help, pilots have trouble orienting themselves relative to  Earth. The runway can seem out of position (downsloping or  upsloping) and, in the worst case, result in landing short of the  runway. If an electronic glideslope or visual approach slope  indicator (VASI) is available, it should be used. If navigation  aids (NAVAIDs) are unavailable, careful attention should be  given to using the ﬂ  ight instruments to assist in maintaining  orientation and a normal approach. If at any time the pilot is  unsure of his or her position or attitude, a go-around should  be executed.  

Bright runway and approach lighting systems, especially  where few lights illuminate the surrounding terrain, may  create the illusion of less distance to the runway. In this  situation, the tendency is to ﬂ  y a higher approach. Also,  when ﬂ  ying over terrain with only a few lights, it makes the  runway recede or appear farther away. With this situation,  the tendency is common to ﬂ  y a lower-than-normal approach.  If the runway has a city in the distance on higher terrain, the  tendency is to ﬂ  y a lower-than-normal approach. A good  review of the airﬁ  eld layout and boundaries before initiating  any approach helps the pilot maintain a safe approach  angle.  

Illusions created by runway lights result in a variety  of problems. Bright lights or bold colors advance the  runway, making it appear closer. Night landings are further  complicated by the difﬁ  culty of judging distance and the  possibility of confusing approach and runway lights. For  example, when a double row of approach lights joins the  boundary lights of the runway, there can be confusion where  the approach lights terminate and runway lights begin. Under  certain conditions, approach lights can make the aircraft seem  higher in a turn to ﬁ  nal than when its wings are level.  

# Preparation and Preﬂ  ight  

Night ﬂ  ying requires that pilots be aware of and operate within  their abilities and limitations. Although careful planning of  any ﬂ  ight is essential, night ﬂ  ying demands more attention  to the details of preﬂ  ight preparation and planning.  

Preparation for a night ﬂ  ight should include a thorough  review of the available weather reports and forecasts with  particular attention given to temperature-dew point spread.  A narrow temperature-dew point spread may indicate the  possibility of ground fog. Emphasis should also be placed on  wind direction and speed, since wind effects on the aircraft  cannot be as easily detected at night as during the day.  

On night cross-country ﬂ  ights, appropriate aeronautical  charts should be selected, including the appropriate adjacent  charts. Course lines should be drawn in black to be more  distinguishable.  

Prominently lighted checkpoints along the prepared course  should be noted. Rotating beacons at airports, lighted  obstructions, lights of cities or towns, and lights from major  highway trafﬁ  c all provide excellent visual checkpoints. The  use of a GPS with a lighted screen adds signiﬁ  cantly to the  safety and efﬁ  ciency of night ﬂ  ying.  

All personal equipment should be checked prior to ﬂ  ight to  ensure proper functioning. It is very disconcerting to ﬁ  nd at  the time of need that a ﬂ  ashlight does not work.  

All aircraft lights should be turned on momentarily and  checked for operation. Position lights can be checked for  loose connections by tapping the light ﬁ  xture. If the lights  blink while being tapped, further investigation to determine  the cause should be made prior to ﬂ  ight.  

The parking ramp should be examined prior to entering the  aircraft. During the day, it is quite easy to see stepladders,  chuckholes, wheel chocks, and other obstructions, but at  night it is more difﬁ  cult. A check of the area can prevent  taxiing mishaps.  

# Starting,   Taxiing, and   Runup  

After the pilot is seated in the ﬂ  ight deck and prior to starting  the engine, all items and materials to be used on the ﬂ  ight  should be arranged in such a manner that they will be readily  available and convenient to use.  

Extra caution should be taken at night to assure the propeller  area is clear. Turning the rotating beacon on or ﬂ  ashing the  aircraft position lights serves to alert persons nearby to remain  clear of the propeller. To avoid excessive drain of electrical  current from the battery, it is recommended that unnecessary  electrical equipment be turned off until after the engine has  been started.  

After starting and before taxiing, the taxi or landing light  should be turned on. Continuous use of the landing light with  revolutions per minute (rpm) power settings normally used  for taxiing may place an excessive drain on the aircraft’s  electrical system. Also, overheating of the landing light could  become a problem because of inadequate airﬂ  ow to carry the  heat away. Landing lights should be used as necessary while  taxiing. When using landing lights, consideration should be  given to not blinding other pilots. Taxi slowly, particularly  in congested areas. If taxi lines are painted on the ramp or  taxiway, these lines should be followed to ensure a proper  path along the route.  

The before takeoff and runup should be performed using the  checklist. During the day, forward movement of the aircraft  can be detected easily. At night, the aircraft could creep  forward without being noticed unless the pilot is alert for this  possibility. Hold or lock the brakes during the runup and be  alert for any forward movement.  [Figure 12-8]

# Takeoff and Climb  

Night ﬂ  ying is very different from day ﬂ  ying and demands  more attention of the pilot. The most noticeable difference  is the limited availability of outside visual references.  Therefore, ﬂ  ight instruments should be used as a reference  in controlling the aircraft. This is particularly true on night  takeoffs and climbs. The ﬂ  ight deck lights should be adjusted  to a minimum brightness that allows the pilot to read the  instruments and switches but not hinder the pilot’s outside  vision. This also eliminates light reﬂ  ections on the windshield  and instruments.  

After ensuring that the ﬁ  nal approach and runway are clear  of other air trafﬁ  c, or when cleared for takeoff by the tower,  the landing lights and taxi lights should be turned on and the  WSC aircraft lined up with the centerline of the runway. If  the runway does not have centerline lighting, use the painted  centerline and the runway edge lights. After the aircraft  is aligned, the heading indicator should be noted or set to  correspond to the known runway direction. The magnetic  compass should read the exact direction of the runway. The  GPS does not provide meaningful information while stopped  or turning because it measures ground track and needs to be  moving to register enough points to provide accurate data.  

To begin the takeoff, the brakes should be released and the  throttle smoothly advanced to maximum allowable power.  As the aircraft accelerates, it should be kept moving straight  ahead between and parallel to the runway-edge lights.  

The procedure for   night takeoffs is the same as for normal  daytime takeoffs except that many of the runway visual cues  are not available. Therefore, the airspeed ﬂ  ight instrument  can be checked during the takeoff roll to ensure the proper  airspeed in being obtained. As the airspeed reaches the  normal lift-off speed, the pitch attitude should be adjusted  to that which establishes a normal climb. This should be  accomplished by using the normal control bar position for the  desired climb speed. After liftoff, instruments can be checked  for proper heading, and airspeed.  [Figures 12-9  and  12-10]  

The darkness of night often makes it difﬁ  cult to note whether  the airborne aircraft is getting closer to or farther from  the surface. To ensure the aircraft continues in a positive  climb, be sure a climb is indicated on the attitude indicator  (if equipped), vertical speed indicator (VSI), and altimeter.  It is also important to ensure the airspeed is at best climb  speed.  

Necessary pitch and bank adjustments should be made by  referencing the attitude, heading, or ground track indicators.  Heading indicators include both the aircraft heading indicators  and the magnetic compass. Once the aircraft starts moving  and establishing a ground track straight down the runway, the  GPS has data points to establish a ground track and becomes  useful once in ﬂ  ight. It is recommended that turns not be  made until reaching a safe maneuvering altitude.  

Although the use of the landing lights provides help during  the takeoff, they become ineffective soon after liftoff when  

pilot ﬂ  ying under VFR must exercise caution to  avoid ﬂ  ying into clouds or a layer of fog. Usually,  the first indication of flying into restricted  visibility conditions is the gradual disappearance  of lights on the ground. If the lights begin to take  on an appearance of being surrounded by a halo  or glow, the pilot should use caution in attempting  further ﬂ  ight in that same direction. Such a halo  or glow around lights on the ground is indicative  of ground fog. Remember that if a descent to land  must be made through fog, smoke, or haze, the  horizontal visibility is considerably less. Under  no circumstances should a night ﬂ  ight be made  during poor or marginal weather conditions.

The pilot should practice and acquire competency  in straight-and-level ﬂ  ight, climbs and descents,  level turns, climbing and descending turns, and  steep turns. The pilot should also practice these  maneuvers with all the ﬂ  ight deck lights turned  off. This blackout training is necessary if the  pilot experiences an electrical or instrument light  failure. Training should also include using the  navigation equipment and local NAVAIDs.

In spite of fewer references or checkpoints, night  cross-country ﬂ  ights do not present particular  problems if preplanning is adequate, and the pilot  continues to monitor position, time estimates, and  fuel consumption. The GPS is the most valuable  instrument for day and night cross-country ﬂ  ying.  For night cross-country ﬂ  ying, spare batteries or  a GPS hooked to the aircraft electric system with  a battery backup is recommended. NAVAIDs,

Figure 12-11.  A properly lit instrument panel and city lights provide  recommended conditions for night flying.  

the aircraft has climbed to an altitude at which the light  beam no longer extends to the surface. The light can cause  distortion when it is reﬂ  ected by haze, smoke, or fog that  might exist in the climb. Therefore, when the landing light  is used for the takeoff, it may be turned off after the climb is  well established provided other trafﬁ  c in the area does not  require its use for collision avoidance.  

A properly lit instrument panel and visual reference to the  ground with city lights are recommended for night ﬂ  ying.  [Figure 12-11]  

# Orientation and Navigation  

At night, it is usually difﬁ  cult to see clouds and restrictions to  visibility, particularly on dark nights or under overcast. The  

if available, should also be used to assist in monitoring en  route progress.  

Crossing large bodies of water at night in single-engine  aircraft is hazardous and not recommended by day or night.  This is from the standpoint of landing (ditching) in the water,  but especially at night because with little or no lighting the  horizon blends with the water making depth perception and  orientation difﬁ  cult. During poor visibility conditions over  water, the horizon becomes obscure and may result in a loss  of orientation. Even on clear nights, the stars may be reﬂ  ected  on the water surface which could appear as a continuous array  of lights making the horizon difﬁ  cult to identify.  

Lighted runways, buildings, or other objects may cause  illusions when seen from different altitudes. At an altitude  of 2,000 feet, a group of lights on an object may be seen  individually; while at 5,000 feet or higher, the same lights  could appear to be one solid light mass. These illusions  may become quite acute with altitude changes and, if not  overcome, could present problems in respect to approaches  to lighted runways.  

# Approaches and Landings  

When approaching the airport to enter the trafﬁ  c pattern and  land, it is important that the runway lights and other airport  lighting be identiﬁ  ed as early as possible. If the airport layout  is unfamiliar to the pilot, sighting of the runway may be  difﬁ  cult until very close-in due to the maze of lights observed  in the area.  [Figure 12-12]  The pilot should ﬂ  y toward the  rotating beacon until the lights outlining the runway are  distinguishable. To ﬂ  y a trafﬁ  c pattern of proper size and  direction, the runway threshold and runway-edge lights must  be positively identiﬁ  ed. Once the airport lights are seen, these  lights should be kept in sight throughout the approach.  

Distance may be deceptive at night due to limited lighting  conditions. A lack of intervening references on the ground  and the inability of the pilot to compare the size and location  of different ground objects cause this. This also applies to  the estimation of altitude and speed. Consequently, more  dependence must be placed on ﬂ  ight instruments, particularly  the altimeter and the airspeed indicator.  

When entering the trafﬁ  c pattern, allow for plenty of time to  complete the before landing checklist. If the heading indicator  contains a heading bug, setting it to the runway heading is  an excellent reference for the pattern legs.  

Every effort should be made to maintain the recommended  airspeeds and execute the approach and landing in the  same manner as during the day. A low, shallow approach  is deﬁ  nitely inappropriate during a night operation. The  

![](images/e564aef034513addb328416ae30ed25d2f6f03d9da924763df24fed63e9b02a4.jpg)  
Figure 12-12.   Use light patterns for orientation.  

altimeter and VSI should be constantly cross-checked against  the aircraft’s position along the base leg and ﬁ  nal approach.  A visual approach slope indicator (VASI) is an indispensable  aid in alerting a pilot of too low of a glidepath. The typical  VASI is set to  $3^{\circ}$   for the recommended aircraft approach. This  19 to 1 glide ratio is too low for a WSC aircraft. A normal  glide ratio for WSC aircraft is 5 to 1, which is   $11^{\circ}$  , much  higher than the normal   $3^{\circ}$   to  $4^{\circ}$   used by aircraft. Therefore,  for WSC VASI ﬁ  nal approaches both white lights should  be visible. If a pilot sees red over white, or especially both  reds, the approach is too low and altitude should be gained,  or at least maintained to get above the normal VASI  $3^{\circ}$   to   $4^{\circ}$   approach at night. This steeper approach allows the WSC  aircraft to glide to the runway and land safely in the event of  engine failure.  [Figure 12-13]  

After turning onto the ﬁ  nal approach and aligning the aircraft  midway between the two rows of runway-edge lights, the  pilot should note and correct for any wind drift. Throughout  the final approach, pitch and power should be used to  maintain a stabilized approach. Usually, halfway through  the ﬁ  nal approach, the landing light should be turned on.  Earlier use of the landing light may be necessary because of  “Operation Lights On” or for local trafﬁ  c considerations. The  landing light is sometimes ineffective since the light beam  usually does not reach the ground from higher altitudes.  The light may even be reﬂ  ected back into the pilot’s eyes  by any existing haze, smoke, or fog. This disadvantage is  overshadowed by the safety considerations provided by using  the “Operation Lights On” procedure around other trafﬁ  c.  

![](images/751da387b15588be23973a11e29d7cbc416e64fce4661dfdf0f0c7388ebdf781.jpg)  

# Figure 12-13.   VASI.  

The approach and landings should be made in the same  manner as in day landings as discussed in Chapter 11,  Approaches and Landings. At night, the judgment of height,  speed, and sink rate is impaired by the scarcity of observable  objects in the landing area. The inexperienced pilot may have  a tendency to round out too high until attaining familiarity  with the proper height for the correct roundout. To aid  in night landings, approach with power on to reduce the  descent rate providing more time for the pilot to see the  runway and start the roundout once the runway is visible. To aid in determining the proper roundout point, continue  a constant approach descent until the landing lights reﬂ  ect  on the runway and tire marks on the runway can be clearly  seen. At this point, the roundout should be started smoothly  and the throttle gradually reduced to idle as the aircraft is  touching down.  [Figure 12-14]  During landings without the  use of landing lights, the roundout may be started when the  runway lights at the far end of the runway ﬁ  rst appear to be  rising higher than the nose of the aircraft. This demands a  smooth and very timely roundout, and requires that the pilot  feel for the runway surface using power and pitch changes,  as necessary, for the aircraft to settle slowly to the runway.  Blackout landings should always be included in night pilot  training as an emergency procedure.  

# Night Emergencies  

Perhaps the pilot’s greatest concern about ﬂ  ying a single- engine aircraft at night is the possibility of a complete  engine failure and the subsequent emergency landing. This  is a legitimate concern, even though continuing ﬂ  ight into  adverse weather and poor pilot judgment account for most  serious accidents.  

If the engine fails at night, several important procedures and  considerations to keep in mind are:  

•   Maintain positive control of the aircraft and establish  the best glide conﬁ  guration and airspeed. Turn the  aircraft toward an airport or away from congested  areas. •   Check to determine the cause of the engine malfunction,  such as the position of fuel shutoff, magneto switch, or  primer. If possible, the cause of the malfunction should  be corrected immediately and the engine restarted. •   Announce the emergency situation to Air Trafﬁ  c  Control (ATC) or UNICOM. If already in radio  contact with a facility, do not change frequencies  unless instructed to change.  

![](images/f3e960c5be9b64fa71ad51777c16cb4344c1654b528651b5dc027728a4b562d9.jpg)  
Figure 12-14.   Roundout when tire marks are visible.  

•   Consider an emergency landing area close to public  access if possible. This may facilitate rescue or help,  if needed. •   Maintain orientation with the wind to avoid a  downwind landing. •   Complete the before landing checklist, and check the  landing lights for operation at altitude and turn on in  sufﬁ  cient time to illuminate the terrain or obstacles  along the ﬂ  ightpath. The landing should be completed  in the normal landing attitude at the slowest possible  airspeed. If the landing lights are unusable and outside  visual references are not available, the aircraft should  be held minimum controlled airspeed until the ground  is contacted. •   After landing, turn off all switches and evacuate the  aircraft as quickly as possible.  

# Chapter Summary  

Night ﬂ  ight requires additional training, a private pilot  certiﬁ  cate, and should be performed only when there is  adequate reference with the Earth, such as city lights or  a full moon. Night ﬂ  ight should never be performed over  open water.  

Night illusions require reference to flight instruments.  WSC pilots can determine pitch control by feel but cannot  determine roll and heading by feel so instrumentation such  as a heading indicator, magnetic compass, or GPS is needed  for directional reference.  

# Abnormal and  Emergency Procedures  

# Introduction  

This chapter contains information on dealing with abnormal  and emergency situations that may occur in flight.  Aeronautical decision-making (ADM), a systematic approach  to determine the best course of action in response to a  given set of circumstances, should always be used rather  than making a quick decision without determining the best  outcome. Most emergencies can be prevented by making the  proper decisions. This may be the ﬁ  rst go/no-go decision of  whether to ﬂ  y, when to ﬂ  y, or where to ﬂ  y. All safe ﬂ  ights  start with proper preﬂ  ight planning.  

Throughout this chapter, all abnormal and emergency  decisions should be based on ADM. Some situations allow  more time than others to evaluate the outcome. ADM  should be applied to any unplanned or unexpected situation  presented.  

In addition to ADM, the key to any emergency situation,  and/or preventing a abnormal situation from progressing  to a true emergency is a thorough familiarity with, and  adherence to, the procedures developed by the manufacturer  and contained in the Aircraft Flight Manual and/or Pilot’s  Operating Handbook (AFM/POH). The following guidelines  are generic and not meant to replace the manufacturer’s  recommended procedures. Rather, they are meant to enhance  the pilot’s general knowledge in the area of abnormal and  emergency operations. If any of the guidance in this chapter  conﬂ  icts with the manufacturer’s recommended procedures  for a particular make and model weight-shift control (WSC)  aircraft, the manufacturer’s recommended procedures take  precedence.  

# Ballistic Parachute System (BPS)  

The ballistic parachute system (BPS) provides an additional  safety margin to ﬂ  ying WSC aircraft. However, if utilized  when other alternatives would produce a better outcome or  if not deployed with the proper procedures, BPS system use  could create a worse situation than not using a BPS. The BPS  should be used only as a last alternative and only after other  options have been evaluated through ADM.  [Figure 13-1]  

![](images/5d2d693ba1117356a33d45a8e33ecc2213236d0c3aebac3ca59f69f060f2123d.jpg)  
Figure 13-1.   WSC aircraft coming down under a ballistic parachute  system.  

The choice of adding a BPS as an additional system for  emergencies is up to the pilot. This decision should be made  by evaluating the disadvantages of an additional system, its  advantages, and the situations in which the system would  be utilized.  

Advantages of a BPS:  

•  BPS can be used if there is a total loss of control of the  WSC. The term “loss of control” is key to when the  BPS should be deployed. Always ﬂ  y the aircraft ﬁ  rst,  but if the pilot cannot control or regain control of the  aircraft (loss of control), this is when the BPS should  be used. Loss of control might result from midair  collisions or wake tip vortices with other aircraft.  A loss of control could also result from structural  failure due to inadequate preﬂ  ight or lack of proper  maintenance.  •  BPS can be used if the engine quits and there are no  suitable landing areas. Although pilots try to have a  suitable landing area within gliding distance, there are  times when a parachute could be used with an engine  failure, such as over high trees.  •  Pilot incapacitation is a situation where the BPS could  be used. This could be a pilot-in-command (PIC)  illness, such as a heart attack, or an external factor,  such as a bird strike in the face temporally blinding  the pilot. For example, if the pilot is incapacitated by  a bird strike, the pilot could feel for the handle and  pull it. Other designs allow the pilot and passenger  to be able to reach and actuate the BPS, while other  designs have two separate handles for the pilot and a  passenger. Many passengers feel safer if they know  they can actuate the BPS if the pilot is unable to ﬂ  y  the aircraft. •  Pilot disorientation with loss of control of the  aircraft is a situation where the BPS could be used.  In the unusual situation of severe vertigo or spatial  disorientation preventing the pilot from differentiating  up from down, such as severe turbulence, night ﬂ  ying,  or ﬂ  ying into bad weather, a BPS could be used.  Attempts should always be made to regain composure;  if attempts fail, then the BPS is an option.  

# Disadvantages of having BPS:  

•  It provides a false sense of security. A pilot might  believe that the BPS can save him or her from  hazardous situations, which could cause the pilot to  develop hazardous attitudes, exceed limitations, and  make bad decisions.  

•  The pilot could deploy the parachute when it is not  needed. A BPS should be utilized only as a last  alternative to normal emergency procedures. It should  not be used when ADM produces a better alternative  for the situation at hand. •  BPS systems installed on a WSC aircraft have greater  initial cost, maintenance, and weight. •  A BPS can be deployed accidentally. This can happen  when the actuation handle is not properly placed, or  when deployed by occupants not following appropriate  procedures. •  BPS systems may not ﬁ  re or could tangle during the  deployment. Like any system, it can fail or not be  operated properly, so there is no guarantee it will  ﬁ  re or deploy properly. However, if it is mounted,  maintained, and operated properly, the chances of a  successful deployment are good.  

The BPS should not be used in abnormal or emergency  situations, such as engine failure when suitable landing areas  are within gliding distance. Other situations in which to avoid  using a BPS are during strong winds/convection/turbulence,  or if lost. Alternatives and greater detail is presented for these  situations where a BPS is not used later in this chapter .  

# Procedures for Using a BPS  

In an emergency situation where ADM is used and the  best outcome for the given situation is the use of a BPS,  the following general procedure for properly operating the  BPS is:  

•  Select the proper location if still in control of the aircraft.  Consider wind drift and a descent rate of 900 to 1,800  feet per minute (fpm). A minimum 500 feet above  ground level (AGL) is recommended for complete  deployment that is low enough to provide accurate  targeting at intended area. (If below 500 feet AGL,  consider this a low deployment and skip this step.) •  Shut off the engine (this is especially important for  pusher WSC). •  Slow down and lift the wing on the side where the  chute will deploy (if a side deployment and above  500 feet AGL). •  Pull the BPS deployment handle hard and as far as  it will go. This can be more than 12 inches in some  situations.  •  Hold the control bar firmly with bent arms until  parachute inﬂ  ates. •  Steer the descending WSC aircraft toward best landing  spot, if possible (some installations that hang from the  top at the hang point center of gravity (CG) may allow  some directional control).  

•  Before impact, put hands in front of face and keep  arms and legs in and tight to body. •  After impact, exit aircraft immediately.  

# Emergency Landings  

This section contains information on emergency landing  techniques in WSC aircraft. The guidelines that are presented  apply to the more adverse terrain conditions for which no  practical training is possible. The objective is to instill in the  pilot the knowledge that almost any terrain can be considered  suitable for a survivable crash landing if the pilot knows how  to slow and secure the WSC aircraft while using the WSC  structure for protection of the pilot and passenger.  

# Types of Emergency Landings  

The different types of emergency landings are:  

•  Forced landing—an immediate landing, on or off an  airport, necessitated by the inability to continue further  ﬂ  ight. A typical example is an aircraft forced down  by engine failure. •  Precautionary landing—a premeditated landing, on  or off an airport, when further ﬂ  ight is possible but  inadvisable. Examples of conditions that may call for  a precautionary landing include deteriorating weather,  being lost, fuel shortage, and gradually developing  engine trouble. •  Ditching—a forced landing on water.  

A precautionary landing is less hazardous than a forced  landing because the pilot has more time for terrain selection  and approach planning. In addition, the pilot can use power  to compensate for errors in judgment or technique. The  pilot should be aware that too many situations calling for a  precautionary landing are allowed to develop into immediate  forced landings when the pilot uses wishful thinking instead  of reason, especially when dealing with a self-inﬂ  icted  predicament. Trapped by weather or facing fuel exhaustion,  the pilot who does not give any thought to the feasibility  of a precautionary landing accepts an extremely hazardous  alternative.  

# Psychological Hazards  

There are several factors that may interfere with a pilot’s  ability to act promptly and properly when faced with an  emergency. These factors include reluctance to accept the  emergency situation, the desire to save the aircraft, and undue  concern about getting hurt.  

A pilot who allows the mind to become paralyzed at the  thought that the aircraft will be on the ground in a very short  time, regardless of the pilot’s actions or hopes, is severely  handicapped. An unconscious desire to delay the dreaded  moment may lead to such errors as a delay in the selection  of the most suitable landing area within reach and indecision  in general. Desperate attempts to correct whatever went  wrong at the expense of aircraft control fall into the same  category.  

The pilot who has been conditioned during training to  expect to ﬁ  nd a relatively safe landing area whenever the  ﬂ  ight instructor closes the throttle for a simulated forced  landing may ignore all basic rules of airmanship to avoid a  touchdown in terrain where aircraft damage is unavoidable.  Typical consequences are making a   $180^{\circ}$   turn back to the  runway when available altitude is insufﬁ  cient, stretching the  glide without regard for minimum control speed in order to  reach a more appealing ﬁ  eld, or accepting an approach and  touchdown situation that leaves no margin for error. The  desire to save the aircraft, regardless of the risks involved,  may be inﬂ  uenced by two other factors: the pilot’s ﬁ  nancial  stake in the aircraft and the certainty that an undamaged  aircraft implies no bodily harm. There are times, however,  when a pilot should be more interested in sacriﬁ  cing the  aircraft so that the occupants can safely walk away from it.  

Fear is a vital part of the self-preservation mechanism.  However, when fear leads to panic, we invite that which we  want most to avoid. The survival records favor pilots who  maintain their composure and know how to apply the general  concepts and procedures that have been developed through  the years. The success of an emergency landing is as much  a matter of the mind as of skills.  

# Basic Safety Concepts  

A pilot who is faced with an emergency landing in terrain  that makes extensive aircraft damage inevitable should  keep in mind that the avoidance of crash injuries is largely  a matter of:  

1.  Keeping vital structure (ﬂ  ight deck where the pilot  and passenger are seated) relatively intact by using  dispensable structure, such as wings, landing gear, and  carriage bottom to absorb the violence of the stopping  process before it affects the occupants.  

2.  Avoiding forward wing movement relative to the  carriage, allowing the mast to rotate into the ﬂ  ight deck  occupants, or the front tube to compress and break,  providing structure to impale/stab the occupants.  

The advantage of sacrificing dispensable structure is  demonstrated daily on the highways. A head-on car impact  against a tree at 20 miles per hour (mph) is less hazardous for  a properly restrained driver than a similar impact against the  driver’s door. Statistics indicate that the extent of crushable  structure between the occupants and the principal point of  impact on the aircraft has a direct bearing on the severity of  the transmitted crash forces and, therefore, on survivability.  Compared to an airplane, the WSC aircraft has less structure  to absorb the impact and is moving slower, but the same  principles apply.  

Avoiding forcible contact with the front tube, cowling,  dashboard, or outside structure is a matter of seat and body  security with the use of seatbelts. Unless the occupant  decelerates at the same rate as the surrounding structure, no  beneﬁ  t is realized from its relative intactness. The occupant  is brought to a stop violently in the form of a secondary  collision.  

Dispensable aircraft structure is not the only available energy- absorbing medium in an emergency situation. Vegetation,  trees, and even manmade structures may be used for this  purpose. Cultivated ﬁ  elds with dense crops, such as mature  corn and grain, are almost as effective in bringing an aircraft  to a stop with repairable damage as an emergency arresting  device on a runway.  [Figure 13-2]  Brush and small trees  provide considerable cushioning and braking effect without  destroying the aircraft. When dealing with natural and man- made obstacles with greater strength than the dispensable  aircraft structure, the pilot must plan the touchdown in such  a manner that only nonessential structure is “used up” in the  principal slowing down process.  

![](images/7762a7c265691e5b23bd01582e674c1a2f520b466539d39c0b3a2c8660fcc7e3.jpg)  
Figure 13-2.   Using vegetation to absorb energy.  

It should be noted that examples presented here are not to  be practiced because these situations are hazardous and can  damage the WSC and injure occupants. These examples are  shown for informational purposes, in case similar situations  arise in the future.  

The overall severity of a deceleration process is governed by  speed (groundspeed) and stopping distance. The most critical  of these is speed; doubling the groundspeed quadruples the  total destructive energy and vice versa. Even a small change  in groundspeed at touchdown, resulting from wind or pilot  technique, affects the outcome of a controlled crash. It is  important that the actual touchdown during an emergency  landing be made at the lowest possible controllable airspeed  using all available means.  

Most pilots instinctively—and correctly—look for the largest  available ﬂ  at and open ﬁ  eld for an emergency landing.  Actually, very little stopping distance is required if the speed  can be dissipated uniformly; that is, if the deceleration forces  can be spread evenly over the available distance. This concept  is designed into the arresting gear on aircraft carriers, and  provides a nearly constant stopping force from the moment  of hookup.  

For example, assuming a uniform   $_{2\mathrm{~G~}}$   deceleration while  landing into a headwind with a   $25~\mathrm{mph}$   groundspeed, the  stopping distance is about 10.5 feet; in a downwind landing  at   $50~\mathrm{mph}$   groundspeed, the required stopping distance is  42 feet—about four times as great.  [Figure 13-3]  Although  these ﬁ  gures are based on an ideal deceleration process,  it is interesting to note what can be accomplished in an  effectively used short stopping distance. Additionally,  landing uphill reduces the stopping distance and landing  downhill increases the stopping distance. Understanding  the need for a ﬁ  rm but uniform deceleration process in very  poor terrain enables the pilot to select touchdown conditions  that spread the breakup of dispensable structure over a short  distance, thereby reducing the peak deceleration of the ﬂ  ight  deck area. A careful consideration must be made considering  wind, slope, and terrain.  

# Attitude and Sink Rate Control  

The most critical and often the most inexcusable error that  can be made in the planning and execution of an emergency  landing, even in ideal terrain, is the loss of initiative over  the aircraft’s attitude and sink rate at touchdown. When the  touchdown is made on ﬂ  at, open terrain, an excessive nose- low pitch attitude brings the risk of “sticking” the nose in  the ground. Steep bank angles just before touchdown should  also be avoided, as they increase the stalling speed and the  likelihood of a wingtip strike.  

![](images/af863bdba5a5b2a0bff41cfdd230ef0520b35bfed1a1dfb0bf2e4866eaac7026.jpg)  
Figure 13-3.   Stopping distance vs. groundspeed.  

Since the aircraft’s vertical component of velocity is  immediately reduced to zero upon ground contact, it must  be kept well under control. A ﬂ  at touchdown at a high sink  rate (well in excess of 500 feet per minute (fpm)) on a  hard surface can be injurious without destroying the ﬂ  ight  deck structure depending on the design of the airframe and  the shock absorbing system. On soft terrain, an excessive  sink rate may cause digging in of the nose wheel with the  wing and/or WSC aircraft rotating forward into the ground,  stopping with severe forward deceleration or tumbling with  higher speeds.  

# Terrain Selection  

A pilot’s choice of emergency landing sites is governed by  the:  

•  Route selected during preﬂ  ight planning and •  Height above the ground when the emergency  occurs.  

The only time the pilot has a very limited choice is during low  and slow ﬂ  ying or during takeoff if the landing approach is  always within gliding distance of the runway.  

It should be understood that the amount of area for available  landing sites increases at a rapid rate with increased altitude.  [Figure 13-4]  As an example, a WSC aircraft with a 5 to 1  glide ratio ﬂ  ying at 500 feet AGL has 500 feet multiplied  by ﬁ  ve feet horizontal (or 2,500 feet) radius on the ground  to select a suitable landing area. For example, use a   $\%$  mile radius. The area of available landing spots is   $\pi\times\mathrm{r}^{2}$  approximately 0.8 square miles. At 1,000 feet AGL, this  area would be 3.1 square miles; at 2,000 feet AGL, this is  about 12.5 square miles; and at 5,000 AGL, this is almost  80 square miles.  

Additionally, ﬂ  ying in a downwind direction provides more  area to be covered while ﬂ  ying upwind reduces the amount  of area that can be covered while looking for a suitable  landing area.  

If beyond gliding distance of a suitable open area, the pilot  should judge the available terrain for its energy absorbing  capability. If the emergency starts at a considerable height  above the ground, the pilot should be more concerned about  ﬁ  rst selecting the desired general area than a speciﬁ  c spot.  Terrain appearances from altitude can be very misleading  and considerable altitude may be lost before the best spot can  be pinpointed. For this reason, the pilot should not hesitate  to discard the original plan for one that is clearly better.  However, as a general rule, the pilot should not change his  or her mind more than once.  

# Approach  

When the pilot has time to maneuver, the planning of the  approach should be governed by three factors:  

1.  Wind direction and velocity  

2.  Dimensions and slope of the chosen ﬁ  eld 3.  Obstacles in the ﬁ  nal approach path and the ﬁ  eld  itself  

These three factors are seldom compatible. When compromises  must be made, the pilot should aim for a wind/obstacle/terrain  combination that permits a ﬁ  nal approach with some margin  for error in judgment or technique. A pilot who overestimates  the gliding range may be tempted to stretch the glide  

![](images/bc812afcf12319e71519d19b92493ac51a20ecc4abf4d818341a3719fa492d82.jpg)  
Figure 13-4.   Increased altitude provides increased landing options.  

across obstacles in the approach path. For this reason, it is  sometimes better to plan the approach over an unobstructed  area regardless of wind direction. Experience shows that a  collision with obstacles at the end of a ground roll, or slide,  is much less hazardous than striking an obstacle at ﬂ  ying  speed before the touchdown point is reached.  

# Terrain Types  

Since an emergency landing on suitable terrain resembles  a situation with which the pilot should be familiar through  training, only the more unusual situation is discussed.  

# Conﬁ  ned Areas  

The natural preference to set the aircraft down on the ground  should not lead to the selection of an open spot between trees  or obstacles where the ground cannot be reached. Once the  intended touchdown point is reached, and the remaining open  and unobstructed space is very limited, it may be better to  force the aircraft down on the ground than to delay touchdown  until it stalls (settles). An aircraft decelerates faster after it is  on the ground than while airborne.  

A river or creek can be an inviting alternative in otherwise  rugged terrain. The pilot should ensure that the water or creek  bed can be reached without snagging the wings. The same  concept applies to road landings with one additional reason  for caution: manmade obstacles on either side of a road may  not be visible until the ﬁ  nal portion of the approach.  

When planning the approach across a road, it should be  remembered that most highways and even rural dirt roads  are paralleled by power or telephone lines. Only a sharp  lookout for the supporting structures or poles may provide  timely warning.  

If the only possible landing alternative is a small clearing and  it is not possible to land the WSC aircraft, the BPS should  be deployed, if equipped, as discussed earlier.  

# Trees  

Although a tree landing is not an attractive prospect, the  following general guidelines help to make the experience  survivable.  

For example, if the trees are taller than 15 feet and not dense  enough to assure the wing could be set on top of them, use the  BPS if so equipped. This provides two possible chances of  hanging up in the trees and a slower descent rate if the WSC  aircraft does not become lodged in the trees and continues a  descent to the ground.  

If the trees are estimated to be shorter than 15 feet or a BPS is  not installed on the WSC aircraft, landing in the trees should  be performed as follows:  

•  Keep the groundspeed low by heading into the  wind. •  Make contact at minimum indicated airspeed, but not  below stall speed, and “hang” the wing in the tree  branches in a nose-high landing attitude. Involving  the underside of the fuselage and both wings in the  initial tree contact provides a more even and positive  cushioning effect. Hold the control bar with both hands  more than shoulder width apart and bend elbows to  lessen the impact of the control bar against the chest.  [Figure 13-5]  

![](images/1cb9b698a701f3f31c24c926c349629aa74201d7d6f4e18d7ad793a06b93b5d4.jpg)  
Figure 13-5.   Using treetops to “hang” the wing during an  emergency landing.  

•  Avoid direct contact of the fuselage with heavy tree  trunks. •  Try to land in low, closely spaced trees with wide,  dense crowns (branches) close to the ground, which  are much better than tall trees with thin tops; the latter  allow too much free fall height. (A free fall from 75  feet results in an impact speed of about 40 knots or  about 4,000 fpm.) •  Ideally, initial tree contact should be symmetrical;  that is, both wings should meet equal resistance in the  tree branches. This distribution of the load helps to  

maintain proper aircraft attitude. It may also preclude  the loss of one wing, which invariably leads to a more  rapid and less predictable descent to the ground.  

•  If heavy tree trunk contact is unavoidable once the  aircraft is on the ground, it is best to involve both  wings simultaneously by directing the aircraft between  two properly spaced trees. However, do not attempt  this maneuver while still airborne.  

# Water Landings (  Ditching)  

Preﬂ  ight planning for any ﬂ  ight where a water landing is  possible should include personal ﬂ  otation devices for the  pilot and occupants. A hook knife should also be accessible  for the pilot and passenger. A beach or landing spot where  an emergency landing can be made on land, is preferred  to landing in water. If a water landing must be made,  the aircraft should be positioned close to land in shallow  water, if possible, preferably four to ﬁ  ve feet deep to use  as a cushion but still deep enough to stand in with the head  above water.  

With any altitude above the water, preparations should be  made to get rid of any items that would make it more difﬁ  cult  to exit the WSC aircraft and swim once it enters the water.  This would include removing boots for swimming, discarding  any camera lanyards, headphones, or other unnecessary  items that could hinder the exit from the WSC aircraft once  underwater.  

There are not many actual accounts of WSC aircraft ditching  in water, but all accounts at stalling above the water or ﬂ  ying  it in at minimum controlled airspeed stops the WSC aircraft  abruptly and puts the occupants under water immediately.  Depending on the speed, the WSC could tumble over the  water before stopping. Another account of a BPS deployment  provided a successful entry into the water. In any event,  the pilot and passenger would most likely be under water  immediately and disorientated. There are two alternate  techniques that have been successfully used for ditching in  the water:  

•  Flying to the water and stalling just above the  surface •  Using the BPS  

# Stalling Just Above the Water’s Surface  

With a stronger wind, ﬂ  ying to the water and stalling just  above the surface is a viable alternative to landing in the  water. It has been done a number of times successfully. The  WSC aircraft should be ﬂ  own directly into the wind to slow  down the groundspeed as much as practical. Once the wheels  are close to the water surface just above minimum controlled  airspeed, abruptly push the control bar out to enter the water  at the slowest speed possible. Take a deep breath and hold it  before hitting the water.  

# Using the BPS  

An alternate water landing technique is to use the BPS. This  should not be used in calm winds because the parachute  would come down over the WSC aircraft and the lines could  entangle the occupants during the escape. A slight breeze or  greater wind (some ripples on the water) is needed for this  technique so the parachute does not come down directly  onto the WSC aircraft. Use the BPS deployment technique  discussed earlier. Take a deep breath and hold it before  hitting the water.  

# Once Under Water in the WSC Aircraft  

Once in the water, immediately release the seat belt, free  yourself and passenger of any restrictions, and swim to the  surface. If disoriented, swim toward light or follow bubbles  upward to the surface. The WSC will be sinking, so escape  must be made quickly. The control bar must be pushed  forward at all costs to release the pilot to exit the aircraft  and swim to the surface. The forces of the water could push  the control bar back and pin the front seat/pilot into the seat.  If the landing is in shallow water, the pressure pinning the  pilot into the seat may stop when the WSC aircraft sinks to  the bottom.  

# Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear  

For any ﬂ  ight away from the airport, basic supplies should be  carried in case there is engine failure. At a minimum, supplies  should include a mobile phone/radio for retrieval, clothes  appropriate for the environment, ropes to tie down the WSC  aircraft, cash/valid credit cards, and food/water.  

In the case of ﬂ  ying cross-country or over remote areas,  emergency equipment should be carried for a possible  extended period of being stranded. In addition to the basics  listed above, suplies for the appropriate time in the elements  should be carried. Survival gear for protection from the  elements should include clothing for hot and cold climates,  as applicable. Without proper clothing, someone can die  within hours from hypothermia or heat exhaustion. Water  is also very important for survival. Food is important, but a  person can survive over a week without it. Additional items  to include are a knife, signal mirror, extra portable radio and  batteries, emergency smoke/ﬂ  ares, and a large space blanket  doubling as tarp.  

Other items speciﬁ  c to unique terrain and climate zone should  also be considered. For mountain terrain, a saw, shovel,  water puriﬁ  er, and 100-foot rope would be appropriate. For  large bodies of water, ﬂ  otation devices, extra water, and a  water puriﬁ  er would be added to the basic survival gear. If  in desert conditions, bring a lot of water and hats for shade.  In situations of extreme temperature changes, add both sun  shading and layered clothing to the gear as appropriate.  

# Engine Failure After Takeoff  

As discussed earlier in Chapter 7, Takeoff and Departure  Climbs, proper takeoff technique provides lower pitch  angles during the initial climb to provide the slowest possible  descent rate for an engine failure after takeoff. The pitch  angle and altitude available for engine failure at takeoff are  the controlling factors in the successful accomplishment of an  emergency landing. If an actual engine failure should occur  immediately after takeoff and before a safe maneuvering  altitude is attained, it is usually inadvisable to attempt to turn  back to the takeoff ﬁ  eld. Instead, it is safer to establish the  proper glide attitude immediately, and select a ﬁ  eld directly  ahead or slightly to either side of the takeoff path.  

The decision to continue straight ahead is often difﬁ  cult to  make unless the problems involved in attempting to turn back  are seriously considered. First, the takeoff was probably made  into the wind. To return to the takeoff ﬁ  eld, a downwind turn  must be made. This increases the groundspeed and rushes  the pilot even more in the performance of procedures and  in planning the landing approach. Second, the aircraft loses  considerable altitude during the turn and might still be in a  bank when the ground is contacted, resulting in cartwheeling  (a catastrophe for the occupants, as well as the aircraft). After  turning downwind, the apparent increase in groundspeed  could mislead the pilot into a premature attempt to slow  the aircraft to a stall. Finally, it is more than one   $180^{\circ}$   turn.  For example, it is ﬁ  rst a   $225^{\circ}$   turn in one direction, then  another  $45^{\circ}$   turn in the other direction, totaling  $310^{\circ}$   of turn.  [Figure 13-6]  

On the other hand, continuing straight ahead or making a  slight turn allows the pilot more time to establish a safe  landing attitude. The landing can be made as slowly as  desired, but more importantly, the aircraft can be landed  while under control.  

At airports where the runways are much longer than needed,  there is typically ample runway to make a straight ahead  landing. If a tight pattern is being used and the crosswind leg  is started at the end of the runway, turning back the additional   $90^{\circ}$   to the runway could be the best option, depending on the  suitability of landing areas straight ahead.  

![](images/75469fd0048570b58d9fe5fc80cfe8e3dab207f0cc502af0fcdc77e289bab803.jpg)  
Figure 13-6.   Amount of turn required to land back on the takeoff  runway.  

Depending on the specific design of the WSC aircraft  considering weight, wing, and carriage, this maneuver can  be performed with no reaction time and as low as 250 to  500 feet AGL. However, the pilot should determine the  minimum altitude that such a maneuver would require of a  particular aircraft. Experimentation at a much higher, safe  altitude, 700 feet AGL as an example, should give the pilot  an approximation of height lost in a descending   $225^{\circ}$   and   $45^{\circ}$   turn at idle power. Starting high above the ground at  low bank angles and monitoring the altitude loss while doing  the required turns to line back up on the runway provides a  good reference. Finding the best bank angle to perform the  required turns for this maneuver with minimum altitude loss  is key to optimizing this maneuver and developing a habit if  this maneuver is needed in a real emergency.  

By adding a safety factor of about 30 percent to account for  reaction time and no thrust from the propeller, the pilot should  arrive at a practical decision height. The ability to make these  turns does not necessarily mean that the departure runway can  be reached in a power-off glide; this depends on the wind,  the distance traveled during the climb, the height reached,  and the glide distance of the aircraft without power.  

This is a highly advanced maneuver with turns close to  the ground. This should be practiced well into the training  program with the instructor. For example, consider an aircraft  which has taken off and climbed to an altitude of 350 feet  AGL when the engine fails. After a typical 4-second reaction  time, the pilot pulls down the nose, maintains control of the  aircraft, and elects to turn back to the runway, losing 50 feet.  [Figure 13-6, A to  $B J$   The pilot performs the   $225^{\circ}$   turn and  loses 300 feet.  [Figure 13-6, B to  $C J$   The pilot must glide back  to the runway, losing another 50 feet.  [Figure 13-6, C to D] The pilot must turn another   $45^{\circ}$   to head the aircraft toward  the runway, losing another 50 feet.  [Figure 13-6,  $D$   to E]  By  this time the total change in direction is   $310^{\circ}$  , the aircraft  will have descended 450 feet, placing it 100 feet below the  runway.  

# Emergency Descents  

An emergency descent is a maneuver for descending as  rapidly as possible to a lower altitude or to the ground for an  emergency landing. The need for this maneuver may result  from an uncontrollable ﬁ  re, avoidance of other aircraft,  weather, or any other situation demanding an immediate  and rapid descent. The objective is to descend the aircraft  as quickly as possible within the structural limitations of  the aircraft. Simulated emergency descents should be made  in a turn to check for other air trafﬁ  c below and to look  around for a possible emergency landing area. A radio call  announcing descent intentions may be appropriate to alert  other aircraft in the area. When initiating the descent, a bank  angle of approximately   $45^{\circ}$   to   $60^{\circ}$   should be established to  maintain positive load factors (“G” forces) on the aircraft.  

Generally, the steeper the bank angle is, the quicker the  descent is. But caution should be exercised with steep bank  angles for extended periods because the high G forces and  rotation can cause disorientation or motion sickness, which  might make matters worse. The manufacturer’s bank and  speed limitations should not be exceeded.  

Emergency descent training should be performed as  recommended by the manufacturer, including the conﬁ  guration  and airspeeds. The power should be reduced to idle. The  pilot should never allow the aircraft’s airspeed to surpass  the never-exceed speed   $\mathrm{(V_{NE})}$   or go above the maximum  maneuvering   $\mathrm{(V_{A})}$   speed, as applicable. In the case of an  engine ﬁ  re, a high airspeed descent could extinguish the  ﬁ  re. The descent should be made at the maximum allowable  bank angle and airspeed consistent with the procedure used.  This provides increased loads and drag and therefore the  loss of altitude as quickly as possible. The recovery from  an emergency descent should be initiated at an altitude high  enough to ensure a safe recovery back to level ﬂ  ight or a  precautionary landing.  

When the descent procedure is established and stabilized  during training and practice, the descent should be terminated.  For longer descents, alternating turn directions should be  used so the pilot does not become disorientated. Prolonged  practice of emergency descents should be avoided to prevent  excessive cooling of the engine cylinders.  [Figure 13-7]  

# Inﬂ  ight Fire  

A ﬁ  re in ﬂ  ight demands immediate and decisive action.  The pilot must be familiar with the procedures to meet this  emergency as contained in the AFM/POH for the particular  aircraft. For the purposes of this handbook, inﬂ  ight ﬁ  res  are classiﬁ  ed as: engine ﬁ  res and electrical ﬁ  res. If a ﬁ  re  extinguisher is installed on the WSC aircraft, the passenger  should be briefed on its use and the pin should be connected  to the extinguisher by a lanyard so it cannot be dropped into  the propeller, creating a worse situation.  

# Engine Fire  

An inﬂ  ight engine ﬁ  re is usually caused by a failure that  allows a ﬂ  ammable substance such as fuel, oil, or hydraulic  ﬂ  uid to come in contact with a hot surface. This may be  caused by a mechanical failure of the engine itself, an engine- driven accessory, a defective induction or exhaust system, or  a broken line. Engine ﬁ  res may also result from maintenance  errors, such as improperly installed/fastened lines and/or  ﬁ  ttings, resulting in leaks.  

Engine fires can be indicated by smoke and/or flames  coming from the engine area. They can also be indicated by  discoloration, bubbling, and/or melting of the engine cowling  

![](images/cf2fc17d0b308bd404b7cc7d7bde42ecddd7115d74b3fce7e72e570ad1411a08.jpg)

skin in cases where ﬂ  ames and/or smoke are not visible to  the pilot. By the time a pilot becomes aware of an inﬂ  ight  engine ﬁ  re, it usually is well developed. Unless the aircraft  manufacturer directs otherwise in the AFM/POH, the ﬁ  rst  step after discovering a ﬁ  re is to shut off the fuel supply to  the engine (if so equipped). The ignition switch should be  left on in order to use up the fuel that remains in the fuel  lines and components between the fuel selector/shutoff valve  and the engine (if equipped with an electric fuel pump). This  procedure may starve the ﬁ  re of fuel and cause the ﬁ  re to die  naturally. If the ﬂ  ames are snuffed out, no attempt should be  made to restart the engine.  

If the engine ﬁ  re is oil-fed, the smoke is thick and black,  as opposed to a fuel-fed ﬁ  re which produces bright ﬂ  ames  with less smoke.  

Some light aircraft emergency checklists direct the pilot  to shut off the electrical master switch. However, the pilot  should consider that unless the ﬁ  re is electrical in nature,  or a crash landing is imminent, deactivating the electrical  system prevents the use of radios for transmitting distress  messages and also causes air trafﬁ  c control (ATC) to lose  transponder returns.  

The pilot must be familiar with the aircraft’s emergency  descent procedures and remember that:  

•  An engine ﬁ  re on a WSC aircraft means the ﬂ  ames  are going to the rear of the aircraft where minimum  components are exposed. If the BPS is used, it would  change the direction of the ﬂ  ames, possibly setting the  wing and/or fuselage on ﬁ  re. The ﬂ  ames could also  burn the parachute line, creating worse problems. •  The aircraft may be structurally damaged to the point  that its controllability could be lost at any moment. •  The aircraft may still be on ﬁ  re and susceptible to  explosion. •  The aircraft is expendable—the only thing that matters  is the safety of those on board.  

# Electrical Fires  

The initial indication of an electrical ﬁ  re is usually a slight  amount of smoke and the distinct odor of burning insulation,  which may not be noticeable in a WSC open ﬂ  ight deck.  Once an electrical ﬁ  re is detected, the pilot should attempt  to identify the faulty circuit by checking circuit breakers,  instruments, avionics, and lights. If the faulty circuit cannot  be readily detected and isolated, and ﬂ  ight conditions permit,  the battery master switch should be turned off to remove the  possible source of the ﬁ  re. However, any materials that have  been ignited may continue to burn.  

If electrical power is absolutely essential for the ﬂ  ight,  an attempt may be made to identify and isolate the faulty  circuit by:  

1.  Turning the electrical master switch off. 2.  Turning all individual electrical switches off. 3.  Turning the master switch back on. 4.  Selecting electrical switches that were on before the  ﬁ  re indication one at a time, permitting a short time  lapse after each switch is turned on to check for signs  of odor, smoke, or sparks.  

This procedure, however, has the effect of recreating the  original problem. The most prudent course of action is to  land as soon as possible.  

The electrical ﬁ  re could expand into a larger ﬁ  re in the  carriage. A ﬁ  re in the cabin presents the pilot with two  immediate demands: attacking the ﬁ  re and getting the aircraft  safely on the ground as quickly as possible.  

# System Malfunctions  

# Electrical System  

The loss of electrical power can deprive the pilot of  communications and navigation systems, but for day/VFR  conditions this is not a life threatening situation because most  engines ignition systems are on a separate electrical system  and not dependent on the battery for keeping the engine  running. However, losing communications does present some  challenges especially if operating at a controlled tower airport  in which procedures in the Airman’s Information Manual  (AIM) would be followed.  

# Pitot-Static System  

The source of the pressure for operating the airspeed indicator,  the vertical speed indicator, and the altimeter is the pitot-static  system. Most WSC aircraft have pressure for the airspeed  indicator. If this becomes plugged, the airspeed indicator may  not read properly. If it is suspected that the airspeed indicator  is not reading properly, use the feel of the aircraft and the  trim position to determine speed. It is perfectly safe to ﬂ  y a  WSC aircraft without an airspeed indicator if the pilot has  developed a feel of the aircraft since the trim position speed  is known and all other speeds can be determined based on the  feel of the air and the pressure on the control bar.  

Altitude and vertical speed utilize static pressure. Because  there is typically no static line connecting these, they operate  independently. Therefore, if one fails or becomes plugged, the  other can act as a reference. For example, if the altimeter fails  for any reason, the vertical speed indicator would provide the  pilot with information on whether the aircraft was climbing,  level, or descending. The global positioning system (GPS)  (if equipped) could also provide altitude readings. If the  vertical speed indicator failed, the altimeter could provide  information on whether the aircraft was climbing, level, or  descending by looking at the altitude reading over time.  

# Landing Gear Malfunction  

If there is any landing gear malfunction before or during  takeoff, the ﬂ  ight or takeoff should be aborted and the  malfunction fixed before attempting another takeoff.  However, if a malfunction takes place during or after takeoff  in which the landing gear is not completely functional for  landing, the situation should be evaluated using aeronautical  decision-making (ADM) to make the best choice based on  the outcome of the situation.  

If a tire falls off, a known ﬂ  at of the tire is evident, or a  landing gear strut has shaken loose or become damaged,  precautionary measures must be taken to minimize the results  from landing with a defective landing gear.  

Fly to a smooth runway where the WSC aircraft can skid  and not stop abruptly and tumble. Inform the local ATC,  UNICOM, or multicom frequency that there is a MAYDAY  in order to obtain immediate help for a crash landing.  

There is no hurry to land, so use ADM to survey the situation  and make the best decision on where and how to land. Find  a location that has medical support, a smooth runway that  minimizes abrupt stops/tumbling, and land into the wind for  the best outcome. Attempt to make a normal approach into  the wind with the lowest possible speed to touchdown.  

# Inadvertant Propeller Strike  

A propeller strike in a pusher WSC aircraft is more dangerous  than in any other aircraft. If an object or the propeller is ﬂ  ung  up into the wing trailing edge, a structural failure could occur.  This situation should not be underestimated or ignored.  

Procedures should be implemented and followed to avoid  propeller strikes from articles ﬂ  ying out of the ﬂ  ight deck.  Passengers sitting in the back are the greatest risk to propeller  strikes. A comprehensive preﬂ  ight brief with proper ﬂ  ight  deck management procedures should reveal any open pockets  or items that could dislodge and ﬂ  y into the propeller. The  passenger in the back should be instructed not to take off  gloves, helmet, or glasses, or pull out a camera/mobile phone  without a lanyard. However, the passenger in the rear seat  cannot be monitored completely; it is possible that items  could ﬂ  y out of the ﬂ  ight deck and go through the propeller,  presenting a serious situation.  

If a bird strike occurs or anything else hits the propeller,  reduce throttle immediately and evaluate the situation. The  severity of the vibration is the key element to determining  what to do. If the vibration is severe, shut off the engine and  make an emergency landing. Minor vibration can be tolerated,  but the risk of ﬂ  ying with a damaged propeller, which could  dislodge and hit the sail, should be minimized. It is best to  shut down the engine and perform an emergency landing.  

# Stuck or   Runaway Throttle  

Throttles can stick above idle or unexpectedly increase, which  is called a runaway throttle. If on the ground, a runaway  throttle can be disastrous if not anticipated and mitigated. A  pilot (and instructor, if teaching) should always have access  to the ignition system in order to shut it off immediately in the  event of a throttle stuck above idle or a runaway throttle. A  runaway throttle can be caused by the pilot or student pushing  on the throttle pedal during taxi or startup, thinking it is the  right brake, as in an airplane. Setting the cruise throttle to  full open rather than full closed during startup also causes a  runaway throttle. On startup, the checklists must be followed,  including cruise throttle closed, foot off of foot throttle, brake  on, propeller cleared, etc. The PIC must have control of the  ignition to shut it off immediately during startup and taxi.  

A runaway or   stuck throttle during ﬂ  ight can be handled by  climbing or ﬂ  ying to a suitable location where the engine can  be shut off and a safe engine-off landing can be made.  

# Abnormal Engine Instrument Indications  

The AFM/POH for the speciﬁ  c aircraft contains information  that should be followed in the event of any abnormal  engine instrument indications. The table in  Figure 13-8   offers generic information on some of the more commonly  experienced inﬂ  ight abnormal engine instrument indications,  their possible causes, and corrective actions. It is important to  know that when an engine temperature probe fails, it usually  reads an unusually low value, zero, or does not register. This  should be taken into account when evaluating the situation  with engine instruments.  

![Figure 13-8.   Common inflight abnormal engine instrument indications, causes, and corrective inflight actions. ](images/0602b8b3597fd7f8184955ba4c53eefac8620e5ba1a863857f7d8004b61a3f86.jpg)  

# Weather Related Emergencies  

# High Winds and Strong Turbulence  

Preﬂ  ight planning for intended airports and winds aloft over  the planned route and possible diversions can provide the  pilot a means of anticipating the winds that would exceed  aircraft or pilot capabilities. However, unanticipated high  winds can create an emergency for any aircraft. High  winds during cruise ﬂ  ight are not a danger unless they  create extreme/severe turbulence, or the pilot is ﬂ  ying with  questionable fuel reserves into a headwind that is stronger  than expected.  

# High Winds and Turbulence During Cruise Flight  

If the winds at cruise altitude provide an unanticipated  slower groundspeed than planned, and the fuel reserves are  questionable, the ﬂ  ight should be diverted to an alternate  airport so there is no chance of running out of fuel for the  intended ﬂ  ight. Stronger headwinds and crosswinds slow the  groundspeed; tailwinds increase the groundspeed, resulting  in the ability to reach airports that are farther away. The GPS  is an accurate tool for measuring an aircraft’s groundspeed  during ﬂ  ight.  

In high winds, it is generally advisable to cruise with enough  ground clearance to assure that turbulence or sinking air does  not reduce altitude to an unsafe level. For example, maintain  at least 1,000 feet AGL when ﬂ  ying in strong winds to be far  enough away from the ground to account for any turbulence,  wind shear, or downdrafts.  

If a pilot is flying and sees high wind or a gust front  approaching with blowing dust or other indicators, a decision  must be made to land and secure the WSC aircraft before  the gust front hits, or turn and ﬂ  y away from the area as fast  as possible. Never ﬂ  y into a gust front. If it looks like strong  winds, it probably is and avoiding it is wise.  

Strong turbulence can be created from high winds, wind  shear, rising/falling unstable air, or any combination of  these. As described in the basic ﬂ  ight maneuvers chapter,  the pilot should keep the wings and pitch angle within the  manufacturer’s limitations through power and control bar  ﬂ  ying techniques. Generally, if the turbulence continues to  increase, ﬂ  y back to where the turbulence was less severe  instead of continuing where the turbulence might become  more severe. However, if the pitch becomes too high and  a whip stall occurs, as the nose drops into a dive, the pilot  should push the control bar full forward and apply full  power for the best chance of recovering to normal ﬂ  ight and  not progressing into a tumble. The best whip stall/tumble  avoidance is to avoid severe turbulence and keeping the nose  within the manufacturer’s limitations.  

# High Winds and Turbulence During Takeoffs and  Landings  

Takeoffs in high winds can simply be avoided by deciding not  to ﬂ  y. However, if a pilot takes off and encounters high winds  or turbulence, high energy should be maintained throughout  the climb and departure.  

If it is determined that the winds are too high for landing  at the intended location, divert to another location or  wait until the strong winds subside to land. This is where  the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS),  Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), or radio  contact with other airports can assist the pilot in ﬁ  nding an  airport with wind conditions within the pilot’s capabilities  and aircraft limitations.  

If the headwind is within the pilot’s capabilities and aircraft  limitations but the crosswinds are above any limitations,  the pilot may need to land on a taxiway or sideways on a  runway that is wide enough, thus reducing the crosswind  component to acceptable levels. Strong winds produce strong  mechanical turbulence on the lee side of objects which should  be considered and avoided during any takeoff or landing in  strong winds.  

# High Winds During Taxi  

For strong head winds during taxi, the nose must be lowered  to keep the WSC aircraft on the ground. Raising the nose  could allow the WSC aircraft to lift off. In any case, the nose  should be lowered completely to keep the WSC aircraft on  the ground. In strong tail winds, the nose must be raised so  that the wind does not get underneath the wing and lift it up  from the back and possibly tumble it forward. If the wing  starts to lift from the back, release the brake and push the  control bar forward to keep the wing from lifting and possibly  tumbling forward.  

Strong crosswinds during taxi must be managed by keeping  the wing level or slightly down into the wind so the wind does  not catch it, lift up, and topple the WSC aircraft to the side,  causing signiﬁ  cant damage. If the wind pushes down on the  wing, it could pin it to the ground which is the better option.  If the wing does become pinned from the wind, the pilot can  give some throttle and steer into the wind, rotating around  the tip and freeing the wing from the pinned state. This may  cause damage to the tip from scraping on the ground. If the  windward side gets too high and wind gets under the wing  lifting it from the side, all efforts should be made to hold it  down while the front wheel is turned downwind and the nose  raised to turn with the wind and avoid tumbling sideways.  

Taxiing to a location that is on the leeward side of a structure  into the wind shadow provides the best option for exiting the  WSC aircraft in high winds. When available, seek assistance  to exit and/or secure the WSC. If no wind shadow is available,  the pilot can turn the WSC aircraft into crosswind and pin  the wing to exit.  

# Inadvertent Flight into Instrument Meteorological  Conditions (IMC)  

Proper ﬂ  ight planning using available weather resources  should allow a pilot to avoid ﬂ  ying when the probability  of low visibility is high. It is expected that WSC pilots  exercise good judgment and not attempt to ﬂ  y when the  visibility is questionable. However, this section is included  as background for this emergency procedure for inadvertent  ﬂ  ight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), ﬂ  ight  without visual reference to the horizon.  

Although it is possible to get an attitude indicator installed  in a WSC aircraft, there are no training requirements for  ﬂ  ying by instruments for sport or private pilot WSC ratings.  Samples of these instruments are shown in  Figures 13-9 and  13-10 .  

Sport pilots are not allowed to ﬂ  y unless there is visual  reference to the surface and three miles visibility. This is  different for private pilots for whom there is not a requirement  for visual reference to the ground and the minimum ﬂ  ight  visibility is only one statute mile (SM).  

Accident statistics show that the average airplane pilot who  has not been trained in attitude instrument ﬂ  ying, or one  whose instrument skills have eroded, will lose control of  the aircraft in about 10 minutes once forced to rely solely  on instrument reference. WSC pilots without any instrument  training attempting to use instruments in IMC conditions  would lose control much sooner. No WSC pilot should  attempt ﬂ  ight into IMC conditions.  

The purpose of this section is to provide guidance on practical  emergency measures to maintain aircraft control in the event  a VFR pilot encounters IMC conditions. The main goal is  not instrument ﬂ  ying; it is to help the VFR pilot keep the  aircraft under adequate control until suitable visual references  are regained.  

The ﬁ  rst steps necessary for surviving an encounter with  IMC by a VFR pilot are:  

•  Recognition and acceptance of the gravity of the  situation and the need for immediate remedial  action.  

![](images/2801d7976ae72fd5f0df95204fd0ed97bad2c709026a05f207151fffa50b988f.jpg)

•  Maintaining control of the aircraft. •  Obtaining the appropriate assistance in getting the  aircraft out of IMC conditions.  

# Recognition  

A VFR pilot is in IMC conditions anytime he or she is unable  to maintain aircraft attitude control by visual reference to  the natural horizon, regardless of the circumstances or the  prevailing weather conditions. Additionally, the VFR pilot  is in IMC any time he or she is inadvertently or intentionally  and for an indeterminate period of time unable to navigate  or establish geographical position by visual reference to  landmarks on the surface. These situations must be accepted  by the pilot involved as a genuine emergency requiring  immediate action.  

As discussed earlier, when entering conditions in which  visibility is decreasing or IMC, the pilot should turn around,  climb, or descend immediately and return to where ground  visibility is known. Do not continue assuming that conditions  will clear and visibility will be regained.  

# Maintaining Aircraft Control  

Once the pilot recognizes and accepts the situation, he or she  must understand that the only way to control the aircraft safely  is by using and trusting the ﬂ  ight instruments. Attempts to  control the aircraft partially by reference to ﬂ  ight instruments  while searching outside the ﬂ  ight deck for visual conﬁ  rmation  of the information provided by those instruments results in  inadequate aircraft control. This may be followed by spatial  disorientation and complete loss of control.  

The most important point to be stressed is that the pilot must  not panic. Recognize the situation and take immediate action.  The task at hand may seem overwhelming, and the situation  may be compounded by extreme apprehension. The pilot  must make a conscious effort to relax and understand that the  only concern at this point is to ﬂ  y toward known visibility.  If climbing into a cloud, reduce throttle and descend. If  descending into a cloud, increase throttle and climb out of the  cloud. If visibility is suddenly lost (e.g. ﬂ  ying into a cloud),  turn   $180^{\circ}$   and ﬂ  y toward known visibility.  

The pilot should remember that a person cannot feel control  pressures with a tight grip on the controls. Relaxing and  learning to control with the eyes and the brain instead of  muscles usually takes considerable conscious effort.  

The pilot must believe that the ﬂ  ight instruments show the  aircraft’s pitch attitude and direction regardless of what the  natural senses tell. The vestibular sense (motion sensing by  the inner ear) can confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the  sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes  in aircraft attitude nor can they accurately sense attitude  changes which occur at a uniform rate over a period of time.  On the other hand, false sensations are often generated,  leading the pilot to believe the pitch attitude or direction  attitude of the aircraft has changed when, in fact, it has not.  These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial  disorientation.  

# Attitude Control  

Attitude is defined as “The position of an aircraft as  determined by the relationship of its axes and a reference,  usually the earth’s horizon.” For WSC, the pitch and the roll  are the relevant attitudes.  

Most aircraft are generally, by design, inherently stable  platforms and, except in turbulent air, maintain approximately  straight-and-level ﬂ  ight if properly trimmed and left alone.  They are designed to maintain a state of equilibrium in  pitch, roll, and yaw. The pilot must be aware, however, that  a change about one axis affects the other axes. The WSC  aircraft is stable in the yaw and pitch axes, but less stable in  the roll axis. The yaw and pitch axes of the WSC are easy  to control, but the roll axis is the challenge for WSC aircraft  control in IMC. The key to emergency aircraft attitude and  directional control, therefore, is to:  

•  Fly at the normal trim speed. To climb, increase  throttle; to descend, decrease throttle. To ﬂ  y level,  ﬂ  y at the throttle setting that provides level ﬂ  ight.  The vertical speed indicator or altimeter provides  information regarding pitch attitude. •  Resist the tendency to overcontrol the aircraft. Fly  with ﬁ  ngertip control. No attitude changes should be  made unless the ﬂ  ight instruments indicate a deﬁ  nite  need for a change. •  Make all attitude changes smooth and small, yet with  positive pressure.

Figure 13-11.   Analog magnetic compass.  

For aircraft not equipped with an attitude indicator, a  magnetic compass  [Figure 13-11]  or a GPS  [Figure 13-12] are the instruments that can be used for roll control. The  compass stays stationary and the WSC aircraft rotates around  the compass dial. A pilot is ﬂ  ying wings level if the compass  heading is not changing. If the compass is changing direction,  the aircraft is banked into a turn. Similarly, the GPS provides  ground track. If ﬂ  ying wings level, the GPS ground track is  steady. If the GPS ground track is changing, the aircraft is  in a bank and turning.  

# Turns  

Turns are perhaps the most potentially dangerous maneuver  for the untrained instrument pilot for two reasons:  

•  The normal tendency of the pilot to overcontrol,  leading to steep banks. •  The inability of the pilot to cope with the instability  resulting from the turn.  

As an example, a  $180^{\circ}$   turn would be the most likely turn to  exit a cloud and return to where there is visibility with the  surface. The direction the turn started should be noted in order  to determine the direction needed to exit the IMC conditions.  For example, if heading North when ﬂ  ying into the cloud,  turn   $180^{\circ}$   and head South to exit the cloud.  

The primary instrument for roll control is the attitude  indicator if so equipped.  [Figures 13-9  and  13-10]  

![](images/7a346e9944117376fd52204151ba6c4844e39fb6571ea34981ebb6914fa01181.jpg)  
Figure 13-12.   Global positioning system (GPS).  

When a turn must be made, the pilot should anticipate and  cope with the relative instability of the roll axis. The smallest  practical bank angle should be used—in any case no more  than   $10^{\circ}$   bank angle.  [Figure 13-13]  A shallow bank takes  very little vertical lift from the wings, resulting in little if  any deviation in altitude, and the WSC aircraft can continue  to be ﬂ  own at trim speed. It may be helpful to turn  $90^{\circ}$   and  then reduce the bank and return to level ﬂ  ight. This process  may relieve the progressive overbanking that often results  from prolonged turns. Repeat the process twice until heading  in the opposite direction of entry in order to exit. Once on  the proper heading to exit the IMC conditions, maintain this  heading until obtaining visual reference with the surface.  

Turns with a magnetic compass or a GPS would be similar  but the only indication of bank angle is the rate at which the  compass or GPS is rotating. The rotation should be slow and  steady and not increase in speed. Any increase in compass  or GPS rotation should be slowed by decreasing the bank  back to level ﬂ  ight to avoid increasing the bank. Practicing  gentle turns and observing the rotational speed of the compass  and GPS under VFR conditions will help a pilot recognize  an acceptable rotational speed ﬂ  ying at trim speed should  need ever arise.

# Chapter Summary  

Most emergency situations can be avoided through proper  maintenance and preﬂ  ight planning. The following summarizes  emergency procedures when they are warranted.  

•  Emergency landings require careful thought to  evaluate wind and terrain for a successful outcome. •  Emergency descents may be required because of  weather, avoiding other aircraft, or aircraft ﬁ  re.  •  Corrective action for system malfunction depends on  the speciﬁ  c aircraft procedures. •  High winds and turbulence are less of a threat when  the WSC aircraft is a signiﬁ  cant distance above the  ground. It is takeoff and especially landing where high  winds and turbulence become the biggest problem. Do  not takeoff, ﬂ  y, or land when the winds and turbulence  exceed aircraft limitations or pilot capabilities. •  If the VFR pilot ﬂ  ies into IMC conditions, the pilot  should return to an area of known VFR conditions. •  The BPS should be used as a last option and only if  total loss of control with no chance of recovery, pilot  incapacitation, or engine failure over hostile terrain.
