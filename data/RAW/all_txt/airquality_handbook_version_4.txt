# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

The long-standing relationship between aviation and air quality continues to endure as the aviation  industry seeks to (i) develop, expand, and/or improve its facilities, equipment, and procedures; (ii)  repair/replace aging infrastructure; and/or (iii) accommodate the forecasted growth in air traffic  (including new entrants such as unmanned aircraft systems and/or commercial space  transportation) while implementing sustainable practices. Meanwhile, air quality regulatory  agencies continually strive to safeguard human health and the natural environment from the effects  of air pollution – including the air emissions associated with aviation.  

In support of this relationship, this  Aviation Emissions and Air Quality Handbook  (the  Handbook )  has been published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a tool and resource to assist  in the planning and completion of  air quality assessments 1  conducted for aviation-related Federal  Actions. More specifically, the purpose of this  Handbook  is essentially three-fold:  

•   To provide guidance, procedures, and methodologies appropriate for use in carrying out  air quality assessments prepared in association with FAA Federal Actions;  •   To help ensure that these air quality assessments meet the requirements of the National  Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the federal Clean Air Act (CAA), and other applicable  laws and regulations; and  •   To provide a process for users to determine when an air quality assessment is considered  necessary, the type of analysis that is appropriate, and the level of effort that is warranted.  

Notably, this  Handbook  was prepared for use by the FAA, its lines of business, and offices as well  as project applicants and/or their representatives that are involved in the assessment of air quality  impacts associated with aviation-related Federal Actions. However, it is intended that other  stakeholders will likewise find it useful including federal/state/local/tribal governmental agencies  and others with an interest in ensuring that the nation’s airports are continually modernized while  safeguarding air quality. By necessity, the  Handbook  is also designed to be used by both seasoned  practitioners and newcomers to the aviation air quality assessment process.  

The earliest version of the  Handbook  was published in 1982 by the FAA and the U.S. Air Force,  was fully revised in 1997, subsequently updated by  Addendum  in 2004, and significantly revised  in 2015. While some of the materials contained in these earlier versions are reused, it is intended  that this version of the  Handbook  replace and supersede these documents. As of the date of  publication of this version of the  Handbook , previous versions are cancelled. Moreover, as a  guidance document, the  Handbook  is not intended to replace laws, regulations, or other  requirements pertaining to air quality. This  Handbook  is a guidance document and should not be  cited as the source for legal requirements (e.g., laws, regulations). In the case of any discrepancies  or differences found between the legal requirements and the  Handbook , users should defer to the  specific language and requirements contained in the legal requirements.  This document does not  have the force and effect of law and is not meant to bind the public or impose any new requirements  in any way, and the document is intended only to provide information to the public regarding existing  requirements under the law or agency policies.  

Finally, the contents of the  Handbook  are organized around a framework of topics and sections  that build upon one another in a progressive fashion. However, for those that wish to focus on  particular topics of interest, each section is designed to be self-supporting and comprehensive.   For general questions regarding this  Handbook  contact the Emissions Division located in the FAA  Office of Environment and Energy (AEE).

# 1.   Introduction and Background  

This section discusses the purposes for which this  Aviation Emissions and Air Quality Handbook   (the  Handbook ) was prepared, the intended audience, its primary objectives, and its contents.  

# 1.1.   Purpose of This Handbook  

This  Handbook  has been published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as explanatory  guidance, and is a tool and resource designed to assist the FAA and stakeholders in the planning,  organization, and completion of air quality assessments for aviation-related projects and/or actions  that require FAA funding, licensing, permitting, or approval (herein referred to as Federal  Actions). In this document, the term Federal Action will refer to FAA performing ‘major federal  actions’ as described in FAA Order 1050.1 (National Environmental Policy Act), as well as a  ‘federal action’ as described in 40 CFR 93.152 (Clean Air Act, General Conformity  Requirements). This reflects the experience that it is rare that an action would satisfy one but not  both of these definitions. If an action meets only one of these definitions, the practitioner will need  to carefully evaluate the appropriate regulatory requirements. However, the  Handbook  does not  directly address this situation.  

Following the guidance in this  Handbook  will help to ensure that air quality assessments for these  Federal Actions are comprehensive, consistent, and appropriate for use in the disclosure and  decision-making processes, as well as assisting stakeholders in meeting legal requirements.  

The effects on air quality from aviation and aviation-related developments and operations have  long been an important subject matter. On the one hand, the aviation industry performs vital civic  and economic functions by serving scheduled and unscheduled operations of air carriers which  enable the transportation of passengers and cargo safely and efficiently across the country and  throughout the world. For over 100 years, airports (including general aviation [GA] airports) have  remained among the enabling resources for progress and prosperity within the communities they  serve. On the other hand, air pollutants associated with aviation emission sources have been an  inevitable consequence of these activities and can have impacts on local and regional air quality  as well as effects on progress toward global climate change goals.  

This long-term connection between aviation and air quality has been growing in importance as the  aviation industry seeks to (i) develop, expand, and/or improve their facilities, equipment, and  procedures; (ii) repair/replace aging infrastructure; and/or (iii) accommodate the forecasted growth  in air traffic (including new entrants such as unmanned aircraft systems and/or commercial space  transportation) while implementing sustainable practices. Meanwhile, air quality regulatory  agencies continually strive to safeguard human health and the natural environment from the effects  of air pollution – including the air emissions associated with aviation.  

Historically, the junction where FAA evaluates air quality impacts from Federal Actions is during  the environmental review that is done to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act  (NEPA) (discussed in greater detail in  Section 2 ,   Regulatory Framework ). In that environmental  review, air quality impacts and compliance with the federal Clean Air Act (CAA) are often  discussed. The CAA mandates that the air quality impacts associated with Federal Actions do not  cause, contribute to, or worsen violations of relevant air quality standards, criteria and/or  thresholds, nor may they delay timely attainment of these standards.  NEPA requires agencies to  consider the environmental impacts of, and alternatives to, proposed Federal Actions before  committing resources to their implementation. NEPA also requires agencies  to inform the public  that the agency has considered such impacts in the decision-making process.  

The FAA typically fulfills the requirements of NEPA and the CAA through the analyses and  documentation included in NEPA reviews. In many cases, the air quality analysis is an integral  component of these assessments and is relied upon by the FAA to support decision-making.  Therefore, in support of the documentation of these air quality assessments, the purpose of this  Handbook  is essentially three-fold:  

•   To provide a process for users to determine when an air quality assessment is considered  necessary, the type of analysis that is appropriate, and the level of effort that is warranted;  •   To provide guidance, procedures, and methodologies appropriate for use in carrying out  air quality assessments prepared in association with FAA Federal Actions;  •   To help ensure that these air quality assessments adequately disclose air quality impacts in  accordance with NEPA and that the project complies with the applicable requirements of  the General Conformity regulations and National Ambient Air Quality Standards  (NAAQS) of the CAA.  

# 1.2.   Use of the  Handbook  

This  Handbook  was prepared for use by the FAA, applicants and/or their representatives, and other  stakeholders who are involved in the assessment of air quality impacts associated with FAA  Federal Actions.  

Notably, the  Handbook  is designed to be used by both seasoned practitioners and newcomers to  the air quality assessment process. As a result, it is necessarily broad and extensive and should not  be expected to provide the level of detail necessary for every type of project, action, or  circumstance. Rather, it is designed to provide the user with an overview of the overall approaches  and the assessment methods that may be used for conducting air quality analyses.  

The earliest version of the  Handbook  was published in 1982 by the FAA and the U.S. Air Force.  This document was fully updated in 1997 by the FAA and subsequently updated by  Addendum  in  2004, and was revised again in 2015. While some of the materials contained in these earlier  versions are reused, it is intended that this version of the  Handbook  replace and supersede these  prior documents. As of the publication of this version of the  Handbook , previous versions are  cancelled. However, as a technical manual or guidance document, the  Handbook  does not replace  laws, regulations, or other requirements pertaining to air quality. In the case of any discrepancies  or differences found between the  Handbook  and the statutes and regulations on which the  Handbook  is based, readers should defer to the specific language and requirements contained in  the legally controlling documents.   This document does not have the force and effect of law and is  not meant to bind the public in any way, and the document is intended only to provide information to  its users and the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.  

# 1.3.   Contents of the  Handbook  

The contents of the  Handbook  are organized around a framework of topics and sections that build  upon one another in a progressive fashion. However, for those that wish to focus on particular  topics of interest, each section is designed to be self-supporting and comprehensive. The following  provides a summary description of each section:  

•   Section 1: Introduction and Background  – Provides basic and introductory information  that helps the user to understand why this  Handbook  was created, its intended audience,  and its overall objectives.  •   Section 2: Legal Framework  – Identifies and summarizes pertinent legal requirements  (e.g., statutes, regulations, etc.) that stipulate or drive the need for an air quality assessment.  •   Section 3: Sources and Types of Air Emissions  – Describes the most common sources of  air emissions associated with aviation, including the types of emissions that typically  characterize each source.  •   Section 4: Air Quality Assessment Process  – Discusses and delineates the overall approach  to assessing air quality impacts associated with FAA Federal Actions. Flowcharts are  provided to help guide the process of performing the assessment.  •   Section 5: Air Quality Assessment Models  – Describes the various assessment models that  are available and recommended or required to conduct aviation-related air quality  assessments. Typical data requirements and documentation of the results are also  discussed.  •   Section 6: Preparing an Emissions Inventory  – Describes the recommended methods for  preparing aviation-related emission inventories for the EPA “criteria” pollutants,  hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and for reporting the  results of these analyses.  •   Section 7: Conducting Dispersion Modeling  – Describes the recommended methods for  conducting atmospheric dispersion modeling around airports and airport roadways and for  reporting the results of these analyses.  •   Section 8: Conformity  – Discusses the conformity regulations of the federal CAA and  how/when they apply to FAA Federal Actions requiring conformity.  •   Section 9: Coordination Best Practices  – Discusses the objectives, benefits, and methods  of conducting agency coordination in support of aviation-related air quality assessment  processes.  

To aid in the comprehension and use of this material, a  Glossary , lists of  References , and  Acronyms  and  Abbreviations  are provided at the end of the  Handbook .  

# 2.   Regulatory Framework  

With a focus on aviation-related Federal Actions, this section identifies and summarizes pertinent  legal authorities (e.g., statutes and regulations) that drive the need for and contents of an air quality  assessment. Note that the term “Federal Action” is used as a general term in this document to  describe actions that may be subject to environmental review. This document is premised on the  term Federal Action representing actions that meet both the criteria for a “major federal action”  under NEPA (as defined in 40 CFR 1508.1(q)) and a “federal action” under the CAA (as defined  in 40 CFR 93.152). It is important to recognize that although each of these terms has a specific  definition under the associated regulations, in practice almost all actions that meet one of these  definitions will meet the other definition. FAA is using "Federal Action" generally in this  document to cover actions that fall within both terms. However, there are instances where it is  important to look specifically at either the NEPA or the CAA requirements and in these instances  this Handbook uses the term ("major federal action" or "federal action") specific to the applicable  law and regulations.  

# 2.1.   National Environmental Policy Act  

Signed into law in 1970, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),  and its amendments  (enacted in 1975 and 1982),  established a broad national policy to protect the quality of the human  environment and provided for the establishment of a Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).  The act provides policies and goals to ensure that environmental considerations are given careful  attention and appropriate weight in all decisions of the federal government. The NEPA  environmental review process discloses these impacts on the human environment including, but  not limited to, impacts to the “natural environment,” air quality, biological resources, water  resources, noise, induced socioeconomic impacts, and land uses that result from major federal  actions. It should reflect a thorough review of all relevant environmental factors, utilizing a  systematic, interdisciplinary approach. The Term “major federal action” refers to activities or  decisions that are subject to Federal control and responsibility as provided in 40 CFR 1508.1 (and  thus subject to NEPA review). These actions include grants, loans, contracts, leases, construction,  research, rulemaking and regulatory actions, certifications, licensing, and permitting.  

In 1977, CEQ was charged with issuing regulations to federal agencies for the implementation of  the procedural provisions of NEPA which were subsequently issued in 1978.  The CEQ regulations  require federal agencies to evaluate and disclose the potential environmental effects of their actions  prior to their implementation.  Importantly, agencies must also notify and involve the public in  parts of the environmental review process for a major federal action expected to cause a significant  environmental impact. The regulations emphasize the importance of integrating the NEPA process  into early project planning, and of consulting with appropriate federal, state, local, and tribal  agencies early in the NEPA process.  The NEPA regulations were most recently updated in 2022  and may continue to evolve, but air quality review is likely to always be a key component of NEPA  reviews.  

The CEQ regulations also describe the different levels of NEPA review:  

•   Categorical Exclusions (CATEXs) – Categories of actions that normally do not have a  significant effect on the human environment, and therefore do not require preparation of  an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement.  FAA has adopted NEPA  implementing procedures that describe pre-established categories of actions that could  potentially be categorically excluded.    •   Environmental Assessments (EAs) – In cases where a CATEX does not apply to a proposed  major federal action, the agency may then prepare an EA, which determines whether or not  a major federal action has the potential to cause significant effects on the human  environment. If the agency determines that the proposed major federal action will not result  in significant environmental impacts, the agency will issue a Finding of No Significant  Impact (FONSI) presenting the rationale for the conclusion.  If the agency determines that  the environmental impacts of a proposed major federal action may be significant, an  Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is prepared.   •   EIS – An EIS is prepared in cases where a proposed major federal action may significantly  affect the human environment. The EIS is a detailed analysis prepared when impacts would  be significant and mitigation measures would not reduce the impacts below significant  levels. The EIS process ends with the issuance of a Record of Decision (ROD) describing  the agency’s decision, alternatives, and any required mitigation and monitoring plans.  

CEQ oversees the procedural provisions of NEPA and the administration of the NEPA process for  all federal agencies. In addition, the CEQ regulations require federal agencies to adopt their own  implementing procedures.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) has issued department-wide  procedures in the form of DOT Order 5610.1C. The FAA’s implementing procedures are contained  within FAA Order 1050.1,  Environmental Impacts: Policies and Procedures 14   which establishes   agency-specific procedures for the consideration of environmental impacts associated with the  FAA’s  major federal actions.  The  order  establishes the  NEPA  process for FAA actions  in  terms  of  planning, procedures, content and format, and public  participation.  In addition to Order 1050.1,  the following orders and guidance documents are also used to assist with FAA NEPA compliance:  

•   FAA Order 1050.1 Desk Reference 15   -   The Desk Reference provides explanatory guidance  for environmental impact analysis and is designed to complement FAA Order 1050.1 .  

•   FAA Order 5050.4 and accompanying Environmental Desk Reference for Airport Actions  -  This order establishes specific procedures for processing  NEPA documents  for  airport  actions under FAA authority . It  is  recommended for  airport  personnel,  sponsors, and  others  involved  in airport actions when considering  environmental impacts. The Desk Reference  provides supplemental guidance for airport actions.  

•   FAA Order JO   $7400.2^{17}$   -  This order prescribes policy, criteria, guidelines, and procedures  applicable to the System Operations Services, System Operations Airspace and  Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM); Technical Operations ATC Spectrum  Engineering Services; the Office of Airport Planning and Programming (APP); the Office  of Airport Safety and Standards (AAS); Technical Operations Aviation System Standards  (AVN); and the Flight Standards Service (AFS).  

# 2.2.   Clean Air Act  

The Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C.   $\S~7401$   et al.) 18  (referred to hereafter as the Act or CAA) is the  United States’ federal law designed to prevent and control air pollution on a national level. The  Act defines the various roles and responsibilities of the EPA, state, local, and tribal governments,  and federal agencies in implementing the Act. The CAA was incorporated into the United States  Code (U.S.C.) as Title 42, Chapter 85, “ Air Pollution Prevention and Control. ” The last major  change to the Act was the  Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 , and since then several minor  changes have been made.  The CAA is comprised of six major “subchapters”  

•   Subchapter I: Programs and Activities  (Parts A thru D) includes –  

o   Part A establishes the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (§ 7409); the  framework for preparing State Implementation Plans (SIP) (§ 7410 and   $\S~7424)$  ; and  describes the assessment and control of hazardous air pollutants (§ 7412);  o   Part B was repealed under the 1990 Amendments of the CAA and moved  Stratospheric  Ozone Protection  to its own Subchapter VI;  o   Part C contains the requirements for Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)  permits.; and  

o   Part D provides the procedures for managing nonattainment areas for the criteria  pollutants and assures that emissions from any source in any state will not interfere  with any portion of a state’s plan to attain and maintain the NAAQS. The legal authority  for the Conformity regulations is outlined in this part as well as the requirements for a  New Source Review permit. 

 •   Subchapter II: Emission Standards for Moving Sources  (Parts A-C) – The parts of this  subchapter provide authority to establish emission standards for on-road vehicles, nonroad  vehicles and equipment, and aircraft—  o   Part A focuses on vehicles and equipment for new on-road models and nonroad models,  including bus standards,   o   Part B focuses on the establishment of aircraft standards, enforcement of the standards  and includes state standards and controls, and  o   Part C has its focus on clean fuel vehicles and the standards for heavy-duty clean-fuel. 

 •   Subchapter III: General Provisions  – The overall administration of the CAA is covered  under this subchapter. This subchapter includes Section 309, which directs the EPA  Administrator in certain circumstances to review and comment in writing on EISs prepared  by other Federal agencies under NEPA;    

 •   Subchapter IV :  Noise Pollution  – Retains EPA’s authority to investigate and study noise  and its effect, disseminate information to the public regarding noise pollution and its  adverse health effects, respond to inquiries on matters related to noise, and evaluate the  effectiveness of existing regulations for protecting the public health and welfare, pursuant  to the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978; 

 •   Subchapter IV-A: 20  Acid Deposition Control  – Identifies provisions for pollutant emissions  in the form of acidic rain, fog, or snow that are shown to damage ecosystems, structures  and impact health. This title deals mostly with emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen  dioxides; 

 •   Subchapter V: Permits  – The program for “Title V” permits issued by state and local  agencies. This subchapter covers permitting for large industrial and commercial sources. It  requires businesses with large emissions to address  pollutants  released into the air, measure  their quantity, and have a plan to control and minimize them as well as to periodically  report; and  

 •   Subchapter VI: Stratospheric Ozone Protection  – Pursuant to the Montreal Protocol of  1990, this subchapter identifies a timeline by which substances with stratospheric ozone  depleting potential will be phased out.  

Of the seven Subchapters listed above, the subjects discussed in subsequent sections of this  Handbook  pertain mostly to  Subchapters I, II,  and  III .  

# 2.2.1.   National Ambient Air Quality Standards  

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)  21  are the core of the national regulatory  program, mandated by the  CAA 1970 Amendments , that enable the EPA to manage areas of the  country experiencing potentially harmful outdoor air pollution (ambient air).  Under the  Amendments, sections 108 and 109 of the CAA instruct the EPA to identify pollutants reasonably  anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, where the emissions of such pollutants may result  from diverse mobile or stationary sources.  Further, the EPA is tasked with establishing standards  for such pollutants and assigning criteria to the standards that accurately reflect the latest scientific  knowledge for indicating potential adverse impacts to public health. These standards are:  

•   There are six “criteria” pollutants for which national standards apply—carbon monoxide  (CO), ozone   $\left(\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$  , nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), lead   $\mathrm{(Pb)}$   and particulate  matter (PM) that includes fine particles   $(\mathsf{P M}_{2.5})^{24}$   with an aerodynamic diameter of   $\leq2.5$     $\upmu\mathrm{m}$  , and   $\left(\mathrm{PM}_{10}\right)$  ,  particles with an aerodynamic diameter of   $\leq\,10~\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$  , so that PM 2.5  

particles are a subset of PM 10  particles;  •   Two types of health-based standards.  Primary standards  stipulate the maximum  permissible concentration of a pollutant in the ambient air above which may cause harm to  public health 26 , including the health of sensitive populations, such as asthmatics, children,  and the elderly. All pollutants have a primary standard with an adequate margin of safety.  Secondary standards  stipulate the maximum concentration in the ambient air above which  may threaten public welfare 27 , including causing decreased visibility, damage to animals,  crops, vegetation, and buildings. Not all pollutants have a secondary standard, and some  secondary standards are identical to the primary standard.  

The EPA assigns for each criteria pollutant—  1.   Indicator  – the name of the pollutant,  i.e. , CO, SO 2 , Pb, NO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 . A  few notes:  

−    $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   is one of a group of gases called “oxides of nitrogen” or NOx, and  while all are harmful to human health and the environment, the EPA  chooses  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   as the indicator because it is of greatest concern;  −    $\mathrm{PM}_{10}$   includes particles equal to or less than 10 micrometers in diameter and  is the indicator that replaced the 1971 indicator for particle pollution, Total  Suspended Particles (TSP);  $\mathrm{PM}_{10}$   emissions include the subgroup of PM2.5  particles which are equal to or less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.  

2.   Standard type  – primary or secondary;  

3.   Averaging time  – the timeframe over which monitored or modeled pollutant  concentrations are averaged for comparison; can be short-term or long-term ( i.e. ,  1-hour, annual, etc.);  4.   Level  – maximum allowable pollutant concentration defined by the EPA as  healthful in the ambient air; measured as parts per million (ppm), ppb (parts per  billion), or micrograms per cubic meter   $(\upmu\mathrm{\bar{g}}/\mathrm{m}^{3})$  ; levels are always measured using  the unit specified for the standard;  5.   Form  – metric against which monitored/modeled data is measured to determine  when the standard is attained ( i.e. , cannot be exceeded, can be exceeded once per  calendar year, etc.).  

The CAA requires the EPA to periodically review the NAAQS—and the science behind them— to determine whether changes are warranted, which may be through revisions of an existing  NAAQS or the establishment of a new NAAQS.  While the NAAQS are established on a national  level, implementation occurs on state, tribal, and local levels. In addition, States and tribal  governments may establish their own ambient air quality standards, provided such standards are  more stringent than the national standards.  

The NAAQS for the six criteria pollutants are summarized in  Table 2-1

# 2.2.2.   Precursor Pollutants  

Some criteria pollutants are emitted directly from a source, and are referred to as primary  pollutants. Other pollutants are formed during photochemical reactions in the atmosphere in the  presence of precursor pollutants—referred to as secondary pollutants. One of these, ozone, is  formed through the photochemical reaction of precursor pollutants oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and  volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight, although some areas in colder  climates experience high ozone levels in the winter, when there is very little sunlight. While there  are no NAAQS for oxides of nitrogen or for VOC emissions, the EPA regulates emission rates of  NOx and VOC based on their potential for ozone formation.  

The secondary formation of PM 2.5  occurs through a complicated series of atmospheric chemical  reactions involving precursor emissions of NOx, VOC,   $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$  , and ammonia (NH 3 ).  Fine  particulate matter, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets, is characterized by size alone  and is not comprised of any specific substance.  Any particles suspended in the air with an  aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 micrometers   $(\upmu\mathrm{m})$   are considered PM 2.5  and are  regulated.  

These tiny particles are harmful because they are small enough to penetrate the natural barriers in  a respiratory system and can reach deep inside the lungs causing serious health problems. When  the PM 2.5  precursors interact in the atmosphere, the gases combine and transform through a series  of reactions ultimately changing from a vapor to a solid.  

Just as there is no standard for NOx or VOC emissions involved in the formation of ozone, there  is no standard for NH 3  emissions involved in the secondary formation of PM 2.5 . The EPA requires  an accounting of primary emissions of PM 2.5  and regulates emissions of the precursor pollutants,  NOx, VOC,  $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$   and   $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$  , to suggest the potential for secondary formation of PM 2.5 .  

# 2.2.3.   Nonattainment Areas  

Nonattainment areas are distinctly defined geographical areas of the country where the EPA finds  the NAAQS are not being attained for one or more of the criteria pollutants.  The EPA database  of attainment status designations at 40 CFR part 81 subpart C defines the geographic extent of  each nonattainment area, mostly by county boundaries, but some nonattainment areas cover  portions of counties and some areas of nonattainment cover portions of multiple states (some areas  can be nonattainment for one or more NAAQS and attainment for others). When the EPA publishes  a new or revised NAAQS, such areas will be “designated” 33  as—  

1.   nonattainment for any area that does not meet the form of the standards for the pollutant,  given the applicable level and averaging period (or that contributes to nonattainment of the  standard in a nearby area that does not meet the standards);  2.   attainment for any area that meets the standard criteria for the pollutant;  3.   unclassifiable for any area that cannot be designated as meeting or not meeting the  standards due to the lack of available information; or  4.   attainment/unclassifiable for any area that while no data is available to definitively  designate the area attainment, the EPA believes that if the data were available, the area  would be shown to attain the standards (sometimes the EPA lists these areas as  unclassifiable/attainment, where the terms are meant to be synonymous).  

After promulgating a new or revised NAAQS, the EPA will publish in the  Federal Register  a final  rule to designate and, if applicable, assign classifications 34  for areas found to be nonattainment for  the NAAQS. These final rules are generally effective 30 or 60 days after publication in the  Federal  Register . Under the conformity requirements, areas designated nonattainment would not be subject  to Conformity requirements until one year after the effective date of designation.  

For some criteria pollutants, the EPA assigns a “classification” to designated nonattainment areas  according to the extent of the air quality problem. For instance, for ozone nonattainment areas the  EPA will, at the time of the designation, classify each nonattainment area as Marginal, Moderate,  Serious, Severe, or Extreme. Areas of CO, PM 10  or PM 2.5  nonattainment are classified as Moderate  or Serious when designating nonattainment.  

In addition, the final rule will provide the date by which the areas must attain the NAAQS, where  the “attainment date” will depend on the classification, if one is assigned. It is the objective of  states with nonattainment areas to attain the standards as expeditiously as practicable, but no later  than the applicable attainment date.  Nonattainment areas that cannot attain the standards by the  attainment date may have sanctions and fines imposed pursuant to 42 U.S.C  $\S$   7509.  

In the case of ozone nonattainment areas, the EPA has a statutory obligation 38  to identify  nonattainment areas that do not attain the ozone standards by the required attainment date. The  EPA may prepare a  Federal Register  notice announcing the agency’s “Determinations of  Attainment by the Attainment Date,” or DAAD, that identifies the areas that failed to attain by the  attainment date. The DAAD may also name nonattainment areas that were attaining by the  attainment date, and those areas for which the EPA intends to approve a 1-year extension of the  attainment date. Nonattainment areas that fail to attain by the attainment date are “reclassified”  (bumped up) to the next most protective classification ( e.g. , a Moderate nonattainment area would  be reclassified as a Serious nonattainment area).  

This detailed information about a nonattainment area may be helpful to inform decision-makers as  they consider the significance of a Federal Action’s air quality impact as assessed under NEPA.  The attainment date may be useful to identify a nonattainment area that could be subject to  reclassification to a higher, more protective classification during the timeframe an agency is  preparing the NEPA document or a conformity evaluation. Review of a DAAD issued for the  nonattainment area may reveal the area is recovering and may be eligible to request redesignation  to attainment during the timeframe an agency is preparing the NEPA document or a conformity  evaluation.  

# 2.2.4.   Attainment of the Standards and  Maintenance Areas  

At the time the EPA promulgates a new or revised NAAQS, one of the first objectives is for the  EPA to identify the areas not attaining the standards, and the remainder of the country is, therefore,  designated attainment. Lacking evidence of nonattainment, attainment areas can be described as  distinctly defined geographical areas of the country where the EPA finds no evidence that the  primary or secondary standards are not being met for one or more of the criteria pollutants.  Generally, Federal Actions are subject to fewer federal or state air pollution control requirements,  such as CAA conformity, when the actions are proposed to occur within attainment areas for the  NAAQS.  

When a State can successfully demonstrate that a nonattainment area attained the NAAQS, and  the claim can be supported by quality-assured monitoring data, the state can request EPA to  approve a “Clean Data Determination” or CDD, demonstrating the area attained the NAAQS. The  state can also submit an application to EPA for approval to “redesignate” the area to attainment  pursuant to 42 U.S.C  $\S$   7407(d)(3)(E).  

A state may receive approval of their CDD request but decide not to submit an application for  redesignation to attainment—it is the States’ prerogative. However, if the State wants the area to  be redesignated attainment, the State must submit, and the EPA must approve, the application for  redesignation.  Thus, attaining the standard is not the same as demonstrating the area has attained  the NAAQS. Also, a nonattainment area listed in a DAAD as attaining the standard is neither a  CDD nor sufficient to support an application for redesignation to attainment.  

In its application to redesignate to attainment, in addition to the requirement to provide supporting  monitoring data, the State must submit to EPA a revision to the SIP.  The submittal must provide  evidence supporting the attainment request, along with the State’s plan to maintain the standard.  This “maintenance plan” 42  must be approved pursuant to CAA section 175A (42 U.S.C  $\S~7505{\mathrm{a}})$  )  and describe the enforceable emission reduction strategies and methods the state will implement  to maintain the standard for a period of at least 20 years 43  beyond the effective date of the approved  redesignation. Thus, the area becomes an “attainment area operating under a maintenance plan.”  However, a section 175A-approved maintenance plan applies only for a primary standard. Such  “maintenance areas” are subject to the 42 U.S.C   $\S~7506(\mathrm{c})$   conformity requirement in much the  same way as nonattainment areas. The area may also be subject to the Prevention of Significant  Deterioration (PSD) program requirements at 40 CFR 51.166, which apply only for attainment  areas.  

# 2.2.5.   State Implementation Plans  

Each state has the primary responsibility for assuring air quality within its entire geographic area  by submitting an implementation plan that will specify the manner in which the NAAQS will be  achieved and maintained within each nonattainment area in the state.  The State Implementation  Plan (SIP) is a collection of air quality measurements, modeling, regulations, controls, programs,  and other measures used to identify air quality issues and to remedy or prevent violations of the  NAAQS. Likewise, Tribal Nations are responsible for developing Tribal Implementation Plans  (TIPs) to address air quality (herein SIP in most cases refers to both SIPs and TIPs).   Within the  timeframe identified in the EPA’s SIP requirements for each new or revised NAAQS, states must  submit an “Infrastructure SIP” to EPA regardless of whether or not there are any designated  nonattainment areas in their jurisdiction. The purpose of the Infrastructure SIP is to demonstrate  that a state has the legal authority, regulatory structure, and necessary resources to implement and  enforce the NAAQS as required by the CAA.  

A SIP must contain certain “elements” required under the CAA for nonattainment and maintenance  areas 47  and include the following, as applicable for the area’s status:  

•   Attainment Demonstration 48  –  Contains ambient monitoring, emissions inventory,  modeling, and proposed control strategies for the initial year, interim year(s), and  attainment year as established by the CAA supporting a demonstration to EPA that the  NAAQS will be attained by CAA-required deadlines;  

•   Control/Program SIP  – Documents the initiation or revision of specific control measures  necessary to demonstrate attainment or otherwise show CAA compliance (e.g., vehicle  

inspection/maintenance programs, fee programs, and reasonably-available control  measures (RACM), including reasonably available control technology (RACT));  

•   Maintenance Plan  – If the state is requesting redesignation from nonattainment to  attainment, the SIP must contain a maintenance plan prepared for approval under CAA  section 175A.  The maintenance plan is valid for 10 years from the effective date of  redesignation, and is extended for an additional 10 years per the requirements of CAA  section 175A, for a total of 20 years, after which the area is redesignated as attainment; and  •   Milestone/Progress SIP 50  – Also known as Rate of Progress or Reasonable Further Progress  Plans (ROP/RFP), these are only required for certain  $\mathrm{O}_{3}$   nonattainment areas, showing that  plans and controls designed to attain the NAAQS will decrease nonattainment area  emissions by at least 15 percent in the first six years and by 9 percent every three years  thereafter until the standard is attained.  

Special purpose plans can also be prepared to address unique issues in select nonattainment or  maintenance areas, such as transport of pollutants across large areas in the case of   $\mathrm{O}_{3}$  , and the  formation of regional haze in the case of PM.  

# 2.2.6.   CAA Conformity Requirements Overview  

Conformity under   $42~\mathrm{U.S.C~\S~}7506(\mathrm{c})$   ensures that applicable federal actions proposed to occur  within maintenance areas and EPA-designated nonattainment areas for any NAAQS will not  interfere with plans established by States and tribes to attain and maintain federal and state/tribal  air quality standards. Therefore, the conformity requirement limits federal government support,  including providing financial assistance, or approving activities that do not conform to the air  pollution prevention and control requirements of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) or a Tribal  Implementation Plan (TIP).  Likewise, conformity is demonstrated by affirmatively showing a  Federal Action is consistent with the SIP/TIP.  The conformity requirements are designed to ensure  that emissions associated with proposed Federal Actions do not cause additional air emissions that  could:  

•   cause or contribute to new violations of any NAAQS in any area;  •   increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any NAAQS; or  •   delay timely attainment of any NAAQS or interim emission reductions.  

There  are two types of Federal Actions for which the conformity requirement uniquely applies— transportation actions and non-transportation actions, the latter being referred to as “general”  actions. The EPA established regulations for implementing the conformity requirements for both  types of actions and codified those rules under 40 CFR part 93 “ Determining conformity of federal  actions to state or federal implementation plans. ”  

Transportation Conformity  –  Under 40 CFR part 93, subpart A, transportation conformity applies  to metropolitan planning organization (MPO) or US DOT adoption, acceptance, approval, or  support of transportation plans or transportation programs.  Transportation conformity also applies  to the approval, funding, or implementation of Federal Highway Administration/Federal Transit  Administration projects, which are defined in 40 CFR 93.101.  

General Conformity  –Under 40 CFR part 93, subpart B, any Federal Action not covered under  transportation conformity is considered a general action subject to General Conformity.  Airport  projects that involve ground access to aviation facility  include  general actions but may also include  actions that are subject to transportation conformity regulations.  

Additional detailed discussion of conformity under the CAA is contained in Chapter 8.  

# 2.2.7.   Indirect Source Review  

Indirect source review (ISR) requirements are state-specific, and some states’ SIPs may require an  ISR when proposed Federal Actions are located in maintenance areas or nonattainment areas 54 .  Indirect sources may include highways, parking facilities, sports and entertainment facilities, and  office buildings. Any applicable indirect source requirements should be identified as early as  possible during the NEPA scoping process and described in the NEPA assessment of air quality.  

States that require ISR generally establish thresholds for the applicability of ISR. For example, a  state may require ISR for all Federal Actions that increase total airport throughput at an airport by  more than 100,000 passengers per year, add 1,000 new parking spaces, or increase aircraft  operations by 1,000 per year. Federal Actions that exceed the ISR thresholds could be required to  complete an indirect source analysis and obtain an indirect source permit from the state.  

# 2.3.   Regulatory Agencies  

There is a wide range of federal, state, local, and tribal governmental agencies involved in air  quality management throughout the U.S. The primary regulatory agencies with jurisdiction in the  management of air quality as it pertains to FAA-supported activities are summarized in  Table 2-2  ( Regulatory Agencies )   along with   synopses of their roles and responsibilities.

# 3.   Air Emissions and Pollutants of Concern  

This section discusses the various types of emission sources associated with aviation and the  principal kinds of emissions associated with these sources.  

# 3.1.   Emission Sources  

A variety of emission sources are associated with aviation. To account for this variation, and for  the purpose of this  Handbook , these emission sources have been grouped into the following six  categories:  

•   Aircraft 57   •   Auxiliary Power Units  •   Ground Support Equipment  •   Stationary/Area 58   •   Ground Access Vehicles  •   Construction  

Computational methods and modeling techniques for assessing aircraft related emissions and their  air quality impacts are discussed in Section 6 (Preparing an Emissions Inventory) and Section 7  (Conducting Dispersion Modeling).  

# 3.1.1.   Aircraft  

Aircraft emissions sources are typically associated with the aircraft main engines. The types of  aircraft include commercial (air carrier and cargo), air taxi, GA, and military aircraft.  

Commercial aircraft are operated by civilian international, national, regional, and commuter air  carriers and charter operators. Cargo aircraft are designed for the commercial transport of freight.  Air taxis are non-air carrier commercial operators that fly scheduled service carrying passengers  and freight on a limited basis. GA aircraft are privately owned and operated on a non-scheduled  basis at a variety of facilities ranging from large commercial airports to small privately-owned  airports. Military aircraft are operated by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and include the  full spectrum of aircraft types, ranging from high performance jet fighters to large transports to  small piston engine training aircraft. Most military aircraft operations occur at DOD-operated air  bases, but many operations also take place at joint-use and/or civilian airports.  

The aircraft main engine(s) is what propels the aircraft forward and is generally classified as either  a gas turbine turbofan, turbojet, or turboprop engine fueled with aviation kerosene (i.e., jet fuel or  Jet A) or an internal combustion piston engine fueled with aviation gasoline (commonly known as  “avgas” or 100 octane low-lead “100LL”). Aircraft engines produce emissions from the  combustion of fuel which varies depending on aircraft engine type, fuel type, number of engines,  power settings, amount of fuel burned, and other variables (e.g., temperature, altitude, etc.).  

It should be noted that many unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) rely on battery stored energy and  thus have no direct emissions during flight. Commercial space vehicles are aircraft but many of  the protocols for emission quantification of space vehicles are rapidly evolving.  

For detailed instructions and guidance on how to compute aircraft engine emissions refer to the  AEDT Technical Manual .  

# 3.1.2.   Auxiliary Power Units  

Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) are smaller turbine engines that provide power to an aircraft during  approach, while taxiing, or while positioned at the terminal gate. APUs power the aircraft’s  instruments, lights, heat and air conditioning, and other equipment and are used for starting the  main aircraft’s engines. APUs burn jet fuel and are common on both large commercial and military  aircraft and some air taxi and GA aircraft.  

APUs typically remain in use while the aircraft is parked and serviced at the gate, unless an  alternative source of electricity and preconditioned air is made available. In such cases, APUs are  reactivated several minutes before the aircraft leaves the gate or parking space. Normally, APUs  are turned off after the main engines have been started, prior to takeoff.  

For detailed instructions and guidance on how to compute APU emissions, refer to the  AEDT  Technical Manual .  

# 3.1.3.   Ground Support Equipment  

Ground Support Equipment (GSE) is a term used to describe the equipment that service aircraft  while loading and unloading passengers and freight at an airport. The types of GSE and their use  depend on the aircraft type and the designated category of an aircraft operation (e.g., passenger,  cargo, etc.). GSE consists of aircraft tugs, air start units, forklifts, tractors, air-conditioning units,  ground power units (GPUs), baggage tugs, belt loaders, fuel or hydrant trucks, catering trucks,  cabin trucks, deicer trucks, water trucks, lavatory trucks, and cargo loaders, among others.  

Air emissions resulting from the operation of GSE vary depending on the number and type of  equipment used to service each aircraft, along with the duration of equipment operation per aircraft  landing-takeoff (LTO) cycle and the fuel type (e.g., gasoline, diesel, propane, electric, etc.).  

For detailed instructions and guidance on how to compute GSE emissions, refer to the  AEDT  Technical Manual .  

# 3.1.4.   Ground Access Vehicles  

Ground access vehicles encompass motor vehicles traveling upon on- and off-airport roadways,  within airport parking facilities, and idling along terminal curbsides. These include airport  passenger vehicles (e.g., private autos, taxis/limos, shuttles, vans, buses, rental cars, etc.); vehicles  transporting airport and tenant employees; and vehicles transporting cargo to and from the airport.  

Air emissions associated with these vehicles are a function of traffic volumes and speeds, distances  traveled, vehicle operating characteristics, fuel type, and ambient conditions.  

For detailed instructions and guidance on how to compute ground access vehicle emissions refer  to EPA’s  MOVES User Guide.  

# 3.1.5.   Stationary and Area Sources  

Stationary and area sources of air emissions at airports consist of both fuel combustion and non- combustion sources. Typical sources include boilers, heaters, generators, snowmelters,  incinerators, live-fire training facilities, aircraft engine testing, fuel storage tanks, cooling towers,  coating and painting operations, de-icing and anti-icing operations, solvent degreasers and  sand/salt piles.  

Air emissions associated with fuel combustion are a function of equipment type, equipment size,  fuel type, combustion processes, and air emission control measures. Non-combustion sources  typically emit evaporative emissions (e.g., fuel storage tanks) and/or fugitive dust emissions (e.g.,  sand and salt piles).  

For detailed instructions and guidance on how to compute stationary/area emissions refer to EPA’s  AP-42 Compilation of Air Emissions Factors.  

# 3.1.6.   Construction  

Construction activities are temporary and variable depending on location, duration, and level of  activity and are generally confined to a construction site and access/egress roadways. These  emissions occur predominantly from the operation of heavy construction equipment (e.g.,  backhoes, bulldozers), on- and off-road vehicles used for the transport and delivery of supplies  and material (e.g., cement trucks, dump trucks), and on-road vehicles used by construction workers  getting to and from a construction site (e.g., cars, pick-up trucks). Construction emissions also  include fugitive dust produced from construction materials staging, demolition, and earthwork  activities, as well as evaporative emissions from asphalt paving operations.  

For detailed instructions and guidance on how to compute construction-related emissions refer to  EPA’s  MOVES User Guide.  

# 3.1.7.   Other Sources  

Other sources of air emissions associated with aviation in general, and airports in particular are of  emerging interest because of their connection to G emissions. These include the following:  

•   Electrical Usage  –  Emissions associated with the generation of electricity using coal, oil,  or natural gas;  

•   Refrigerants  –  A range of chemicals used for refrigeration and air conditioning that are  comprised of substances possessing high global warming characteristics (e.g., Freon,  chlorofluorocarbons, etc.); and  •   Waste Management  –  Emissions associated with solid waste generation and the recycling  and solid waste disposal practices employed by the airport/on-ground facilities.  

# 3.2.   Pollutants of Concern  

There are a variety of air pollutants associated with aviation-related activities that can potentially  have an impact on the environment. This section identifies and discusses these pollutants which  consist of EPA’s criteria pollutants and their precursors, GHGs, and HAPs.  

# 3.2.1.   Criteria Pollutants  

As discussed in  Section 2  ( Regulatory Framework ), the EPA has established the NAAQS under  the CAA for six common air pollutants known as “criteria pollutants.” These air pollutants consist  of CO, Pb, NO 2 , O 3 , PM, and SO 2 . The criteria pollutants are generally described in  Table 3-1  ( EPA Criteria Air Pollutants ).  

![Table 3-1. EPA Criteria Air Pollutants  ](images/68d55af25f0ce4be24a30f47a75599e99d409eb9ece88fb29ae4b037b1b446af.jpg)  

![](images/f34f1ff94fa9d66b88565e724d4404bf606dc743dc9eaf072f4d439923b667c2.jpg)  
Source:  EPA,  Six Common Air Pollutants , 2013,  https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/ .  

# 3.2.2.   Hazardous Air Pollutants  

Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are pollutants for which there are no NAAQS, but are still  regulated under the federal CAA because of their potentially adverse effects on human health and  the environment. Also known as “air toxics,” these pollutants are comprised of a wide array of  organic and inorganic compounds (e.g., formaldehyde, 1 acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, acrolein,  1,3-Butadiene, xylene, lead, naphthalene, propionaldehyde). In relation to aviation sources, such  emissions are present in the exhaust of aircraft, APUs, GSE, and motor vehicle engines and, to a  lesser extent, of boilers, fuel facilities, and other stationary sources.  

For a detailed discussion on when and how to assess HAPs associated with aviation, refer to  Section 6.2   (Hazardous Air Pollutants)  and the AEDT  User Guide  and  Technical Manual .  

# 3.2.3.   Greenhouse Gases  

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are pollutants for which there are no NAAQS and are emitted  principally from the combustion of fossil fuels, decomposition of waste materials, and  deforestation. GHGs are linked to a phenomenon called the “greenhouse effect.”  

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the six main GHGs whose  emissions are related to human activities (e.g. combustion of fossil fuels, agriculture, land use  change) are carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$  , methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide   $(\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O})$  , and fluorinated gases such  as hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), per fluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ), which are  typically reported as carbon dioxide equivalents   $(\mathrm{CO_{2e}})$  .  

GHG emissions associated with aviation are principally in the form of   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   and are generated by  aircraft, APUs, GSE, motor vehicles, and an assortment of stationary sources. For the most part,  CO 2  emissions from these sources arise from the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., jet fuel, avgas,  diesel, gasoline, compressed natural gas [CNG]) and are emitted as by-products contained in the  engine exhausts. Other GHGs associated with airport operations include   $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$  , water vapor   $\mathrm{(H}_{2}\mathrm{O)}$  ,  soot, and sulfates – but are emitted by airports to a far lesser extent than CO 2 . Emissions of HFCs,  PFCs, and   $\mathrm{SF_{6}}$   are most commonly linked with refrigeration, air conditioning, and other coolants.  

For a detailed discussion on when and how to assess GHGs associated with aviation, refer to  Section 6.3   (Greenhouse Gases) .  

Table 3-2  ( Sources of Air Emissions and Pollutants of Concern at Airports)  provides a summary  listing aviation-related sources of air emissions and the types of pollutants they emit.  

![Table 3-2.  FAA summary of sources of air emissions and pollutants of concern at airports  ](images/19372d552d5a3738ce864e275ebd264da7673e9764f46c339787bce3029bdb76.jpg)  

![](images/2bdbe277fe7aa56b526bf27ef9234c698bf570ad6ffbb0c6aa8b9573034847f7.jpg)  

1  Contributions of   $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$   emissions from commercial aircraft are reported as zero. Years of scientific measurement  campaigns conducted at the exhaust exit plane of commercial aircraft gas turbine engines have repeatedly indicated  that  $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$   emissions are consumed over the full emission flight envelope [Reference:  Aircraft Emissions of Methane  and Nitrous Oxide during the Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment , Santoni et al., Environ. Sci. Technol., July  2011, Volume 45, pp. 7075-7082]. As a result, the EPA published that: “…m ethane is no longer considered to be  an emission from aircraft gas turbine engines burning Jet A at higher power settings and is, in fact, consumed in  net at these higher powers.”  [Reference:    EPA,  Recommended Best Practice for Quantifying Speciated Organic  Gas Emissions from Aircraft Equipped with Turbofan, Turbojet, and Turboprop Engines , May 27, 2009 [EPA-420- R-09-901],  https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P1003YX3.PDF?Dockey=P1003YX3.PDF ]. In accordance with  the following statements in the  2006 IPCC Guidelines  (IPCC 2006), the FAA does not calculate  $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$   emissions for  either the domestic or international bunker commercial aircraft jet fuel emissions inventories. “ Methane   $(C H_{\mathcal{Y}}$   may  be emitted by gas turbines during idle and by older technology engines, but recent data suggest that little or no  CH 4  is emitted by modern engines.” “Current scientific understanding does not allow other gases (e.g.,  $N_{2}O$   and  CH 4 ) to be included in calculation of cruise emissions .” (IPCC 1999).  

2  Not all HAPs are emitted by these sources. To identify the type of HAP emitted by this source category refer to  the FAA/EPA documents:  Recommended Best Practice for Quantifying Speciated Organic Gas Emissions from

# 4.   Air Quality Assessment Procedure  

As discussed in  Section 1  ( Introduction and Background ), the primary role of this  Handbook  is  explanatory guidance, which will serve as a tool and resource designed to assist the FAA and  stakeholders in the planning, organization, and completion of air quality assessments for aviation- related projects and/or actions that require FAA funding, licensing, permitting, or approval  (Section 1 defined these as Federal Actions). Following the guidance in this  Handbook  will help  to ensure that air quality assessments for these Federal Actions are comprehensive, consistent, and  appropriate for use in the disclosure and decision-making processes, as well as assisting  stakeholders in meeting legal requirements.  

In the most fundamental terms, the NEPA air quality assessment process described in this Section  attempts to assist users quickly and accurately determine if Federal Action-generated emissions  are significant 60  and provide sufficient documentation of that assessment.  

In addition to the NEPA air quality assessment, this Section also identifies a methodology to ensure  that, when necessary, the assessment demonstrates the Federal Action’s conformity with a SIP  under the CAA section 42 U.S.C   $\S~7506$  . The purpose of the two processes differ considerably.  The NEPA assessment—a procedural requirement—is intended to identify potentially significant  impacts of a proposed action (as defined in FAA order 1050.1) for many categories of the  environment, including air quality.  Conformity—a substantive requirement–is intended to  support achieving the NAAQS as expeditiously as possible. The CAA’s conformity requirement  is independent from the threshold of significance under NEPA for air quality impacts. Importantly,  failure to demonstrate an affirmative conformity determination, when the action is subject to the  CAA conformity requirement, precludes the federal agency from taking the Federal Action.  

Further, in some cases, a portion of a Federal Action may require consideration under the  transportation conformity rule (See  Section 8.0 Conformity) . Although rare, ground access  projects should include coordination with the appropriate MPO early and often when there may be  interaction with the development of metropolitan Transportation Plans (TP) and metropolitan  Transportation Improvement Programs. This is especially valuable for ground access projects in  the vicinity of aviation facilities. The MPO also plays an important role in the General Conformity  process since a conformity applicability analysis must be based on the latest planning assumptions  from the TP, which is put forth by the MPO. Thus, when ground access projects are anticipated to  be part of a Federal Action, practitioners should inform the FAA, and the FAA should initiate early  coordination with the local MPO to determine if the Federal Action will be subject to the  Transportation Conformity regulations. The analysis necessary to fulfill the CAA conformity  requirement (general and transportation) is covered fully in  Section 8.  

The flowchart in  Figure 4-1  ( Air Quality Assessment Process for a federal action ) shows the  general steps needed to complete an air quality assessment under NEPA.  Each of these steps are  fully described in the following paragraphs. This assessment process is intended for projects  requiring a Federal Action as described in  Section 2 ( Regulatory Framework) .  It is important to  note that all reasonably foreseeable 63  emissions (i.e. construction and operational) associated with  a Federal Action need to be considered in this analysis.

# 4.1.   Step 1: Determine if the Federal Action falls within an  exemption to General Conformity  

The General Conformity regulations contain a list of exempt actions, including a list of 22 exempt  actions that would result in no emissions increase or an increase in emissions that is clearly  de  minimis.   If the Federal Action is exempt, the General Conformity requirements do not apply. To  offer some examples, Table 4-1 presents the five most common Federal Actions undertaken by the  FAA that are listed as exempt because they result in no emissions increase or an increase in  emissions that are clearly  de minimis . In addition, two other exemptions that sometimes are a factor  in FAA Federal Actions are listed in Table 4-1.  It is important to note that Table 4-1 is not a  comprehensive list of exempt actions, instead it is simply a summary of those most common to the  FAA.  

# Table 4-1. List of exempt actions most commonly associated with FAA Federal Actions  

1. Rulemaking and Policy Development and Issuance [40 CFR 93.153(c)(2)(iii)]   2. Routine Maintenance and Repair Activities [40 CFR 93.153(c)(2)(iv)]   3. Planning, Studies, and Provisions of Technical Assistance [40 CFR 93.153(c)(2)(xii)]  4. Transfers of Ownership, Interests, and Titles in Land, Facilities, and Real and Personal  Properties, Regardless of the Form or Method of the Transfer [40 CFR 93.153(c)(2)(xiv)]  5. Actions (or Portions Thereof) Associated With Transfers of Land, Facilities, Title, and  Real Properties Through an Enforceable Contract or Lease Agreement Where the Delivery  of the Deed Is Required To Occur Promptly After a Specific, Reasonable Condition Is Met,  Such as Promptly After the Land Is Certified as Meeting the Requirements of  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), and  Where the Federal Agency Does Not Retain Continuing Authority To Control Emissions  Associated With the Lands, Facilities, Title, or Real Properties [40 CFR 93.153(c)(2)(xix)]  6. Alterations and Additions of Existing Structures as Specifically Required by New or  Existing Applicable Environmental Legislation or Environmental Regulations (e.g., Hush  Houses for Aircraft Engines  $^{**}$  ) [40 CFR 93.153(d)(4)]  7. Federal Actions Which Are Part of a Continuing Response to an Emergency or Disaster  [40 CFR 93.153(d)(2) and (e)]  8.   Air traffic control activities and adopting approach, departure, and enroute procedures  for aircraft operations above the mixing height specified in the applicable SIP or TIP.  Where the applicable SIP or TIP does not specify a mixing height, the Federal agency can  use the 3,000 feet above ground level as a default mixing height, unless the agency  demonstrates that use of a different mixing height is appropriate because the change in  emissions at and above that height caused by the Federal action is  de minimis.  

If the project qualifies as exempt under 40 CFR 93.153, the NEPA analysis should document this  finding in the air quality analysis with a notation, such as “ the action is deemed to be exempt  pursuant to CFR 93.153 ”  and then cite to the specific sub-section within 93.153 that applies to the  action.  Depending on the circumstance, this notation may simply be a restatement of the above  sentence, or may include evidence and planning documents supporting this conclusion. If there is  a potential decrease in emissions this should likewise be documented in the NEPA analysis. It is  advisable in these cases to make note that the CAA conformity requirement was reviewed, and the  requirement is not applicable.  

The list of exempt and clearly  de minimis  actions is specific to analysis under the General  Conformity regulations (i.e. for nonattainment and maintenance pollutants).  Given that anything  included on the list was unlikely to cause a significant impact in a nonattainment area, it is safe to  conclude these project types would not cause a significant impact in an attainment area. Therefore,  the analysis of emissions for attainment pollutants (i.e. air quality analysis under NEPA) can be  satisfied if a major federal action qualifies as exempt under 40 CFR 93.153 .  For attainment  pollutants, this would be documented as described in the preceding paragraph.  

In the rare case where there are scientific analyses that would provide additional information to  help determine if there are significant impacts, nothing in this document precludes FAA from  seeking a more comprehensive analysis.  If the project is not exempt under 40 CFR 93.153, the  analysis should continue to Step 2.  

# 4.2.   Step 2: Does the Federal Action qualify as Presumed to  Conform?  

The General Conformity regulations have detailed specifications about the applicability of the  regulations to Federal Actions. It is important to be aware of the FAA’s development of a  Presumed to Conform list that may also exclude Federal Actions from review under the General  Conformity regulations.  This step is deliberately set to occur before the consideration of the  attainment status of the region.  

In July 2007, the FAA developed a list of actions that are Presumed to Conform (PTC) pursuant  to the General Conformity regulations (72  Federal Register  41565; summarized in  Table 4-2 ).  Please note that it is important to review the actual Federal Register document containing the  FAA’s PTC list as there are limitations that may not be fully captured by the summarized list in  Table 4-2 .  

The General Conformity requirements only apply to Federal Actions proposed to occur within  nonattainment or maintenance areas, to ensure that a Federal Action does not cause or contribute  to a violation of the NAAQS, or delay timely attainment of the NAAQS.  The FAA published the  PTC list in 2007 in the Federal Register for the purpose of screening projects in nonattainment  areas.   In that notice, FAA also identified activities that may qualify for an existing exemption  from General Conformity.  Given that anything included on the PTC list was unlikely to cause a  significant impact in a nonattainment area, it is safe to conclude these project types would not  cause a significant impact in an attainment area. Therefore, the analysis of emissions for attainment  pollutants (i.e. air quality analysis under NEPA) can be satisfied by determining that a major  federal action qualifies for the PTC list.  

It is noted that there are two types of PTC actions: 1)   some actions would be very unlikely to ever  exceed the  de minimis  threshold and thus do not include any numeric threshold as a condition of  their designation of PTC; and 2) PTC actions that have the potential to exceed the  de minimis  threshold and thus the PTC list cites a specific numeric threshold as a condition of their designation  of PTC.  

# Table 4-2. List of Presumed to Conform Actions  

![](images/a66b453bc6b7c6c234a339de59bb82d9d3e8aeac4e5dfd2ef0c264cd9ecbc73d.jpg)  

# 4.2.1.   Application of Multiple Presumed to Conform Actions  

After determining that a Federal Action is not exempt or clearly  de minimis , the fifteen categories  of PTC actions should be evaluated to determine if any are applicable to the proposed action. The  description of each PTC action is independent of the description of other PTC actions. In the case  of Federal Actions that are within the scope of more than one of the PTC actions, it is permissible  to use multiple appropriate PTC actions to complete the air quality analysis.  

When using multiple PTC actions for a single Federal Action the FAA needs to contemplate the  aggregate impact; a proportional aggregation of individual PTCs with numeric thresholds cannot  exceed a numerically combined threshold (explained further below). Beyond this approach, a  Federal Action may also rely on 1) a PTC with a numeric threshold to be combined with not more  than one PTC without a numeric threshold, and/or 2) multiple PTCs without numeric thresholds.  

To better illustrate how a Federal Action containing two actions that fit within the scope of PTCs  with numeric thresholds would be analyzed, consider an example of a terminal project (PTC #6)  with an associated ramp (PTC #3) being constructed in a serious ozone nonattainment area. For  this example, the footprints of the terminal project are assumed to be   $50{,}000\;\mathrm{ft}^{2}$  , and the ramp area  is assumed to be 5 acres (217,800 ft 2 ). In a serious ozone nonattainment area, Table III-1 of the  PTC list (72 FR 41570) provides size thresholds for these two project types (92,945 ft 2  and   $1{,}096{,}929~\mathrm{ft}^{2}$  , respectively) and this table indicates  $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$    is the most constraining pollutant. Thus,  in aggregating, the threshold for the terminal space covered by PTC #6 (50,000 ft 2 /92,945 ft 2 ) is 

  $53.8\%$   consumed, and the threshold for the ramp area covered by PTC #3 (217,800 ft 2 /1,096,929 

  $\mathrm{ft}^{2}$  ) is   $19.9\%$   consumed. Collectively, that means that only   $73.7\%$   of the threshold has been  consumed and this Federal Action would appropriately be approved using the two PTCs.  

When the air emissions analysis for a Federal Action is based on the project category being on  either the exempt list or PTC list, the FAA should ensure the specific exemption or PTC that the  agency has relied on is properly documented. This should include relevant information supporting  the determination. In the case of a Federal Action that relied on a PTC with a numeric threshold,  the documentation should include a clear summary of relevant project parameters. No further  analysis is required aside from the documentation.  

If there is a possibility that significant impacts could occur (as defined in FAA Order 1050.1),  nothing in this document precludes FAA from seeking a more comprehensive analysis.  Examples  of such instances could include: emissions that are very near publicly accessible land and may  cause public health impacts, or a Federal Action that results in the emission of hazardous air  pollutants and minimal criteria pollutants. It is important to note that the Federal Register  publication of the PTC list provided context on the justification for each action on the PTC list.  Thus, merely because a proposed action could appear consistent with the brief description in the  PTC list does not mean the action qualifies to use the PTC list.  For that reason, this document has  consistently used the term “ qualifies  for the PTC list”.  

# 4.3.   Step 3: Determine if the Federal Action is in an EPA- designated nonattainment area or maintenance area  

This step of the assessment process is to establish the attainment/nonattainment status of the study  area and, if applicable, to identify those pollutants for which the area is designated nonattainment  or maintenance (see  Section 2  and  Section   8  (Conformity),  for further descriptions of  attainment/nonattainment areas).  

The EPA Greenbook 69  contains a current listing of nonattainment and maintenance areas for each  criteria pollutant. This assessment should be made for each criteria pollutant. In other words, there  are effectively six air quality reviews (one for each criteria pollutant) associated with each Federal  Action.  For any pollutant for which the area is classified as being in nonattainment or maintenance,  further analysis of that pollutant should follow the guidelines contained in  Section 8,  unless the  Federal Action has been deemed exempt or presumed to conform.  

For the emission of all pollutants where the area is classified as attainment or unclassified, the  attainment Screening Criteria (see  Section 4.4 ) can be applied. In the case that a pollutant is  classified as attainment, but another concurrently emitted pollutant has triggered an escalation of  the analysis for the Federal Action to the General Conformity rules, the Federal Action may  quantify attainment pollutants according to the methodology specified in the General Conformity  rule; if that is more convenient.  However, the General Conformity rule should not be used to  determine significance of emissions of those attainment pollutants, regardless of whether they are  emitted concurrently with nonattainment/maintenance pollutants. Attainment pollutants are not  subject to the General Conformity rule and are only subject to NEPA (where the threshold of  significance is a violation of the NAAQS).  

During this step it is also necessary to determine if the Federal Action will occur in a state that is  designated as an Ozone Transport Region (OTR). This is because attainment areas that are located  in an OTR have more restrictive air quality requirements under the Clean Air Act.  As such, the  screening methodology is more cautious for these areas. As of March 14, 2022, 40 CFR 81.457  identified the following states in the OTR: Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New  Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, parts of Maine,  parts  of Virginia,  and the District of Columbia. This information is needed for the Screening Criteria  outlined in  Section 4.4 .  

# 4.4.   Step 4: Evaluate if Attainment Screening Criteria is exceeded  

4.4.1.   Airport Screening Criteria  

In assessing the environmental impact of attainment pollutants for a Federal Action at an airport,  Screening Criteria 73  are used to determine whether an inventory of projected emissions is required.  The screening was developed based on a review by the FAA of criteria pollutant emission  inventories for a representative array of major federal actions at airports. In that review, FAA  identified a handful of key project parameters that can serve as a proxy for emissions.  

A series of questions (see  Section 4.4.1.1  below) are used to evaluate the four Screening  Parameters that could cause (or contribute to) changes in airport emissions. The responses to those  four questions are project variables that are compared to the Screening Parameters and include:  (A) increase in aircraft operations, (B) new aircraft taxi/delay/idle, (C) additional Ground Access  Vehicle (GAV) trips by licensed on-road vehicles, and (D) additional construction equipment  

•   Project Variable A (Aircraft Operations) . Increase in   number of aircraft LTOs  (including changes in GSE and APUs associated with the increase in aircraft  operations) as a result of the Federal Action.   •   Project Variable B (Aircraft Taxi Time) . Increase in delay or changes to the  taxi-in and -out times and/or taxi distances by on-ground aircraft as a result of the  Federal Action.  •   Project Variable C (GAVs) .   Changes in the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) from  GAV trips on airport property driven by on-road vehicles that occur as a result of  a Federal Action.  •   Project Variable D (Construction Equipment   and/or GSE) . Number of pieces  of construction equipment that are active and working on the Federal Action,  and/or the number of pieces of GSE that will be brought to the airport and operated  as a direct result of the Federal Action. This does not include GSE increases due  to increases in aircraft operations.  

and/or GSE. Each variable has a corresponding letter (A, B, C, and D) for representation in  emissions computations.  Collectively, the aggregation of the four Screening Parameters comprises  the Screening Criteria for Federal Actions at airports.  

In establishing the Screening Criteria, FAA examined a range of criteria used in the CAA that are  applied to nonattainment areas in order to determine the possibility of adverse impacts.  These  criteria included the significant emission rate threshold, the prevention of significant deterioration  rules, the definition of major stationary sources, nonattainment new source review thresholds, and  ozone transport regulations.  In this holistic context of the CAA, it is fair to say if emission  increases can prudently by undertaken in nonattainment areas, then there will be no adverse impact  to air quality from a comparable emission increase in an attainment area.  A technical analysis was  performed for each of the four Screening Parameters to determine activity levels which would not  cause an emission increase greater than levels that the CAA deems acceptable for nonattainment  areas.  It is important to note that the analysis of activity levels focused on the “worst case” aspects  of an activity.  As an example, if a fleet of vehicles or equipment includes many low emission  models and a couple of high emitting units, the Screening Criteria was established by assuming  that all units in a Federal Action would be high emitting units.  

There are two key time periods to evaluate with the Screening Criteria—the construction period  and the operational period. All four questions need to be answered for each of these periods.  

# 4.4.1.1.   Screening Parameter questions  

The FAA has identified attributes about Federal Actions at airports that indicate a Federal Action  has little chance of causing adverse air quality impacts. For Federal Actions affecting airports, the  following four Screening Questions, and accompanying variables, have the greatest causal  relationship with adverse air quality impacts. Exceeding the screening metric specified in any of  the following four questions triggers the preparation of an emission inventory. It should also be  noted that the Screening Questions are not appropriate when there is the potential for significant  impacts that require specialized analysis to properly evaluate.  The questions comprise the  necessary information to make an evaluation of the Screening Criteria:  

A.   If the project is not in the OTR, will the FAA Federal Action cause an increase in all aircraft  operations of more than 14,000 operations per year? If the project is in the OTR, will the  FAA Federal Action cause an increase in GA aircraft operations of more than 5,000  operations per year, or an increase in all aircraft operations of more than 14,000 operations  per year?  

B.   Will the FAA Federal Action cause a projected annual increase of aircraft delay exceeding  340,000 minutes?  

C.   Will the FAA Federal Action cause an additional 25 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT)  from on-road vehicles per year?  

D.   If the project is not in an OTR, will the FAA Federal Action result in the use of an average  of more than 125 pieces of construction equipment and GSE during a year? If the project  is in an OTR, will the FAA Federal Action result in the use of an average of more than 50  pieces of construction equipment and GSE during a year?  

The detail and accuracy of the responses to each of these questions should be reflective of the  proximity to the screening threshold – it is unnecessary to spend considerable resources preparing  a precise answer when a rough calculation shows the initial value to be far away from the threshold.  

When evaluating the Screening Criteria, for increases in aircraft operations, the screening question  anticipates that GSE, APU, and ground transportation emissions associated with the increased  operations are part of the Screening Criteria. Since GSE support for aircraft operations are included  in the aircraft Screening Criteria, only when GSE operations are increasing independent of aircraft  operations would they be included in question D (e.g., new bag system requires purchase of 50  new bag tugs due to remote loading location). For the Screening Question on construction  equipment and GSE, the emissions were calculated based on 365 days per year of usage at 16  hours per day.  

As an example, if a construction project outside an OTR would use 400 pieces of construction  equipment for 16 hours per day for only 3 months, this would be converted to an equivalent number  of construction equipment – 100. Since this is less than the 125 pieces of equipment specified in  the Screening Criteria, the answer to the question would be negative.  

# 4.4.1.2.   Emissions from more than one Screening Parameter  

If there are emissions associated with more than one of the four Screening Parameters in a given  year, it is necessary to aggregate those emissions for comparison to the Screening Criteria. It is  important to note that the Screening Criteria is evaluated by calendar year. In other words, these  Screening Questions could need to be answered 20 times if a Federal Action’s impacts extended  across 20 years. However, as discussed in  Section 4.4.1.3  ( Emissions from different years)  it is  expected that the analysis can be handled by the use of peak emission years.  

When aggregating emissions, each of the four Screening Parameters should be normalized, i.e.,  divide the anticipated activity level by the Screening Criteria for that Screening Parameter. As an  example, for construction equipment, if there were 25 units expected to be on site outside the OTR,  this would be divided by the 125-unit Screening Criteria resulting in a normalized value of 0.2.  

Each of the normalized values would be added together and if the sum exceeds 1.0, an emission  inventory would be required (the same as if one of the Screening Questions had been exceeded).  The formula for this aggregation is shown below.  

In a given year, if  $\begin{array}{r}{A^{\prime}+B^{\prime}+C^{\prime}+D^{\prime}\geq I.\theta,}\end{array}$  , prepare emissions inventory.  

Where:   $\mathbf{A}^{\bullet}=$  Increase in Aircraft LTO’s / 14,000\*    $\mathbf{B}^{\prime}\ =$  Increase in Aircraft Taxi/Idle/Delay (minutes) / 340,000   $\mathbf{C}^{\prime}=\mathrm{GAV}$   Trips (VMT) / 25,000,000   $\mathbf{D}^{\ast}=\mathbf{\partial}$  Number of pieces of GSE and Construction Equipment /  $125^{**}$     $*_{-}5{,}000$   if the project primarily involves GA aircraft AND is in the  OTR   $**-50$   if in the OTR  

# 4.4.1.3.   Emissions from different years  

The Screening Criteria is intended to quickly evaluate the magnitude of air emissions and  determine whether the additional resources associated with preparing an emission inventory is  justified.  In order to effectively make that determination, the FAA can simply look at whether the  ‘worst case’ year exceeds the Screening Criteria. Since operational and construction emissions  often don’t have a lot of commonalities where one can readily identify the ‘worst case’ year, it is  expected that many Federal Actions will have to evaluate the Screening Questions for at least one  construction year and one operational year. In such a case, analysis of multiple construction years,  or multiple operational years would not be needed if the ‘worst case’ year for each of those periods  can be reliably identified. It is also typically less common for emissions from construction  equipment and emissions from increased aircraft operations to occur in the same year.  If they  occur contemporaneously, it would be expected that a peak emissions year for operations, a peak  emissions year for construction, and a peak emissions combined year would all be evaluated.  Regardless of the exact scenario, it is common for at least a construction year and an operational  year to be evaluated relative to the Screening Criteria.  

# 4.4.1.4.   Example emissions aggregation  

Based on the four Screening Questions, it is instructive to apply the method to some example  applications. For the purposes of demonstration, two scenarios are examined. In each of the  scenarios, emission changes occur in both the construction period and operational period, but it is  assumed there is no overlap of these two periods. If there is overlap between construction and  operations, then those Screening Questions should be aggregated using this methodology.  Further,  all years in the operational period can be represented by a single ‘worst case’ year. Thus, each  scenario contains two analyses.  

Scenario–I - Airport “QRS”  –  Approval of funding for a new taxiway at an airport outside an  OTR that enhances safety but doesn’t contribute or cause a change in its existing aircraft  activity.  In evaluating each question, this Federal Action is expected to cause (A) no additional  aircraft operations, (B) 10,000 minutes of additional aircraft taxi time after the construction of the  new taxiway is complete (i.e., 1 minute of taxi delay for each of the 10,000 LTOs that are expected  to use the new taxiway), (C) 300,000 additional VMT due to longer travel route after the  construction of the new taxiway is complete, and (D) 50 pieces of construction equipment. Tables  4-3 and 4-4 show the aggregation results for construction years and operational years, respectively.  

![Table 4-1. Airport “QRS” Aggregation Results — Construction Years  ](images/0b5481b9ea5df68809149118ab7c57b145d7ce55842e97cf3fb4e7ba15be5d4d.jpg)

In this example, both aggregation results are below 1.0 and therefore the project does not exceed  the Screening Criteria.  No further action would be required.  

Scenario –II - Airport “TUV”  –  FAA funding for construction of a runway extensions at an  airport in the OTR that enables larger aircraft to serve the airport . This project is expected to  cause a change of (A) 4,000 additional LTOs, (B) no increase in taxi/idle/delay, (C) 10 million  additional VMTs, and (D) the use of 75 pieces of construction equipment.  Table 4-3  and  Table  4-4  show the aggregation results for construction years and operational years, respectively.  

![Table 4-3. Airport “TUV” Aggregation Results — Construction Years  ](images/c1a94839d2b801b84a0900b596e2a7c1217ce1fd3d9b16b6bfcb7f4b924b2b6c.jpg)

Source: RoVolus, 2018.  

In this example, the aggregation for construction equipment is greater than 1.0, even though the  operational aggregation is below 1.0. Therefore, the Federal Action exceeds the Screening Criteria  for the construction period and an emissions inventory would be required.  

# 4.4.2.   Unmanned Aircraft System Screening  

In order to assess the air quality impact of Federal Actions that facilitate hybrid and unmanned  aircraft systems (UAS) being introduced into a specific air quality area, Screening Criteria have  been evaluated that are intended to provide a rapid assessment of the impact of air emissions from  such vehicles, and determine whether the additional resources associated with preparing an  emission inventory is justified. A Screening Criteria was established using  $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$   emissions factors  for aircraft engines and the same emission rate increases used for the airport screening method  described in  Section 4.4.1 . Much like the Screening Parameters for airport actions, the analysis  was performed on a “worst case” scenario which in this case was emissions from an aircraft that  was placed in service prior to the introduction of emission standards. This screening assessment is  limited to Federal Actions that are associated with the operation of UAS and the assessment is  based on total fuel consumption resulting as a result of the Federal Action.  If the Federal Action  results in a total annual consumption increase of more than 1.4 million additional gallons (500,000  gallons in an OTR) of fuel per year, then an emissions inventory is recommended.  

# 4.4.3.   Air Traffic Screening  

Federal Actions that result in air traffic changes can be screened for air quality impacts by using a  simplified Screening Criteria that examines the emissions of criteria pollutants below the mixing  height (nominally   $_{3,000},$   above field elevation).  This Screening Criteria was established using   $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$   emissions factors for aircraft engines and the same emission rate increases used for the airport  screening method described in  Section 4.4.1 . Much like the Screening Parameters for airport  actions, the analysis was performed on a “worst case” scenario which in this case was emissions  from this highest emitting aircraft contained in the AEDT model. This Screening Criteria is  intended to provide the aviation environmental practitioner with the means to rapidly evaluate the  impact of such air traffic actions and determine whether the additional resources associated with  preparing an emissions inventory is justified. This screening assessment shows that if the Federal  Action results in the total annual addition of more than 150,000 minutes of aircraft operation per  year below the mixing height (60,000 minutes in an OTR) then an emissions inventory is  recommended.  

# 4.4.4.   Documenting the Screening Evaluation  

When the air emissions analysis of an attainment pollutant for a Federal Action is based on the  Federal Action falling below the Screening Criteria, the FAA should ensure the analysis (and  aggregation) is properly documented. The documentation should include at a minimum the  responses to the Screening Criteria for each year considered and the supporting documentation  used to answer the questions.  In addition to the above documentation, the NEPA analysis can  include a notation that “ The project parameters did not exceed the Screening Criteria and the  project does not have the potential to cause significant  air quality impacts. ” In the case that there  is the possibility of significant impacts that would be better understood through further scientific  analysis, nothing in this document precludes FAA from seeking a more comprehensive analysis.  

# 4.5.   If Federal Action exceeds Screening Criteria or was subject to  General Conformity  

The FAA’s key obligation for any NEPA review is to assess potential environmental impacts and  determine if they exceed a threshold of significance. The screening of air quality impacts for  attainment pollutants is intended to identify projects that have minimal chance of adversely  impacting ambient air quality and the potential for a significant impact; therefore allowing  practitioners to quickly identify those Federal Actions that are unlikely to have significant air  quality impacts and avoid unnecessary analysis. Please note that exceedance of the Screening  Criteria is not by itself an indication the Federal Action will exceed the FAA’s threshold of  significance for air quality (see FAA Order 1050.1F, Exhibit 4-1). Rather, exceeding the Screening  Criteria merely indicates that an emission inventory should be performed to determine the  magnitude of the air quality impacts.  It is also important to note that if the Federal Action’s  emissions of nonattainment pollutants have satisfied the General Conformity requirements it  inherently means that a Federal Action will not increase the frequency or severity of any NAAQS  violations and the Federal Action will not delay attainment of the NAAQS.  Thus, establishing that  there will be no significant impacts to air quality from those pollutants.  

# 4.5.1.   Pollutant quantification for attainment pollutants when Screening  Criteria is exceeded  

When it is determined from the Screening Criteria that an emissions inventory is needed, two  questions must be considered: (1) which pollutants need to be quantified, and (2) should both  operational and construction emissions increases be quantified if only one exceeds the Screening  Criteria?  

The Screening Criteria has been established based on all criteria pollutants and associated  precursors. Depending on emitting activity, CO, VOC, or NO X  were identified as control pollutants  in prior research and the development of emissions models. In no cases were Pb, PM, or   $\mathrm{{SO}_{X}}$  emissions expected to be greater than the emissions for the control pollutants. Regardless of this  consideration, common emission models generally prepare emission inventories for all pollutants,  except for Pb (these emissions are generally limited to piston-powered aircraft running on leaded  aviation gasoline). Thus, it makes sense to disclose all the pollutants that are easily calculated by  the models. The AEDT model must be used to quantify emissions associated with aircraft  operations and delay. However, EPA’s MOVES model would need to be used if quantifying  emissions from ground access vehicles, construction equipment, or GSE. Popular modeling  software (e.g. ACEIT) may have limited accuracy and only regulatory models approved in  Appendix W of 40 CFR part 51 are suitable for regulatory actions.  Instead, a federally developed  emission model, approved in Appendix W of 40 CFR Part 51, should be used for quantification.  

See the  Appendix to this Handbook for guidance on addressing GHG emission inventories .  

Given the limited control and opportunities for mitigation of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs),  and the lack of a threshold of significance for these pollutants, FAA does not require quantification  of these emissions, and expects preparation of such an inventory to be uncommon.  

# 4.5.2.   Pollutant quantification for Federal Actions subject to  General Conformity requirements  

Analysis of nonattainment and maintenance pollutants for a Federal Action is performed pursuant  to the General Conformity requirements. However, the General Conformity requirements only  apply to the Proposed Action and No Action alternatives. Whereas NEPA requires disclosure of  air quality impacts from all alternatives. As such, an emissions inventory needs to be prepared for  any alternative in nonattainment and/or maintenance areas that has not been considered in the  General Conformity analysis.  

When there is an increase that exceeds the  de minimis  threshold in emissions of a non-reactive  criteria pollutant, the General Conformity requirements often will call for dispersion modeling of  those emissions 74  and that level of analysis would typically be appropriate for other NEPA  alternatives being considered. Dispersion modeling is not expected to be appropriate for any other  circumstances.  

# 4.5.3.   Emissions in Multiple Years  

In an effort to balance the need for public disclosure against the need to prioritize limited resources,  the FAA recognizes that there is a balance between quantifying every project year and simply  quantifying the year of peak emissions.  

This balance applies to Federal Actions where one of the Screening Criteria is exceeded, or the  aggregate sum of the Screening Criteria is exceeded, and an emissions inventory needs to be  prepared for a specific pollutant.  Preparing additional years of emissions inventories may not  provide additional information since many Federal Actions will only have a meaningful impact on  emissions during construction, or one operational year can be representative of all operational  years. In these cases, looking at all years would provide minimal benefit. Alternatively, limiting  emissions quantification to the years where the Screening Criteria is exceeded would diminish  disclosure of impacts and does not substantially reduce the burden of analysis. The incremental  effort of preparing the quantification of an additional year is considerably less than the effort of  preparing the initial analysis year.  

In balancing these concerns, the FAA recommends that if the Screening Criteria is exceeded for  construction emissions, the operational emissions outside of the construction period should be  quantified if they are greater than   $1/6^{\mathrm{th}}$   of the screening threshold, i.e. 0.167. If operational  emissions exceed the Screening Criteria, construction emissions should always be quantified for  the year of peak emissions.  

All aspects of Section 4.4 and 4.5 apply to an analysis for each criteria pollutant for each Federal  Action (i.e. each Federal Action has six such analyses).  However, it is recommended that if an  emissions inventory is already being prepared for a criteria pollutant, FAA should consider  documenting the emissions inventories for other criteria pollutants when no additional modeling  is required to calculate those emission inventories.  

# 5.   Air Quality Assessment Models  

This section identifies the various models and other supporting resources that are most often used  by  Handbook  users for conducting aviation-related air quality analyses. These tools comprise  computer models and databases that enable the users to compute emission inventories and conduct  dispersion modeling for sources of air emissions that are typically encountered in FAA Federal  Actions.  Many of these models cover a broad array of sources, in addition to aviation sources, and  the accuracy of the models is dependent on appropriate input data and information.  

Table 5-1  (Emissions Inventory and Dispersion Models) identifies the most common regulatory  air quality models available to  Handbook  users for conducting air quality analyses associated with  aviation-related Federal Actions. It is important to note that only air quality models that have been  approved by EPA and that are listed in Appendix W of 40 CFR 51 may be used for regulatory  purposes (i.e., any FAA Federal Action).  In many analyses, more than one model may be used.  There are other models not listed in Table 5-1 that may be applicable and appropriate for use in   specialized situations  depending on circumstances associated with a project. Practitioners seeking  approval for the use of a regulatory model that is not listed in Table 5-1 should contact AEE-300  for guidance. The air quality analyses performed by these models include emissions inventories  for both airport operations and construction as well as airport and roadway dispersion modeling.  These models are further detailed within this section.  

If multiple regulatory models are used to determine impacts from different aspects of a Federal  Action, care must be taken to ensure that the results are accurately compiled and reflect the total  impact of a Federal Action.  This  Handbook  attempts to avoid reference to specific versions of a  model (unless describing historical evolution) because these models are frequently updated.  

![Table 5-1. Emissions Inventory and Dispersion Models  ](images/81143c16705c5c55000a8bc6f1aba90a44ec75b959b143503bdfeb726c6fe7d9.jpg)  

# 5.1.   Aviation Environmental Design Tool  

The Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) is developed and distributed by the FAA Office  of Environment and Energy (AEE).  Essential and up-to-date information regarding AEDT as  well as links to AEDT documentation and FAA guidance can be obtained on the official website  for AEDT.  

AEDT is a software system that dynamically models aircraft performance to compute emissions,  fuel burn, and noise and assess their interdependencies. AEDT has the capability to conduct “full- flight” or “gate-to-gate” analyses at a single airport or a “metroplex,” 77  and further assess these  facilities and operations at regional, nation-wide, and global levels.  

# 5.1.1.   AEDT Development and Architecture  

In 2012, AEDT version 2a (i.e., AEDT 2a) replaced the “legacy” regional noise analysis tool, the  Noise Integrated Routing System (NIRS).  The primary purpose of AEDT 2a was to model the  environmental consequences of airspace and procedure actions being designed and implemented  by the FAA’s Air Traffic Organization (ATO). AEDT 2a also included the capability to assess   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   emissions from aircraft main engines.  

In 2015, AEDT version 2b replaced AEDT 2a and the legacy airport air quality and noise analysis  tools - the EDMS and the Integrated Noise Model (INM). AEDT2b then became the FAA’s single  environmental assessment tool for air quality and noise impacts from aircraft for all Federal  Actions, including but not limited to airport and airspace NEPA reviews, General Conformity  determinations, Master Planning studies, and Part 150 Noise Compatibility Programs.  

The AEDT user interface and underlying software architecture are distinct from that of the EDMS  and INM models. AEDT is built on the Microsoft .NET Framework and is capable of running on  Microsoft Windows desktop and server operating systems. It is supported by an extensive system  of relational databases and an ESRI 79  geospatial capability. Input data are entered into AEDT using  the user interface, an XML-based AEDT Standard Input File (ASIF), and/or other EDMS/INM  model import tools.  

# 5.1.2.   AEDT Usage for Air Quality Assessments  

Using AEDT, aviation-related emissions inventories can be computed for five of the criteria  pollutants (CO, NO 2 , PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and SO 2 ), ozone precursors (  $\mathrm{{NO}_{x}}$   and VOCs), and lead via the  calculation of avgas consumption.  Sources of aviation-related emissions included in AEDT  encompass aircraft, APUs, GSE, and an array of stationary sources (e.g., boilers, generators, etc.).  Motor vehicle emissions must be computed through use of the EPA’s Motor Vehicle Emission  Simulator (MOVES) 82  model independently of AEDT.  

Dispersion modeling can also be conducted within the AEDT interface, based on the results of the  emissions inventory and supplemented with meteorological data and the definition of receptor sets.  Once the necessary data are entered into AEDT, AEDT internally invokes the EPA AERMOD  modeling system to perform the specified dispersion calculations. The resulting concentrations are  displayed in the AEDT interface via maps of receptor sets and as tabular output.  

# 5.2.   MOVES/NONROAD  

The Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) is the emission modeling system developed  by the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) that estimates emissions for  mobile sources, but not including aircraft.  Currently MOVES provides emissions for on-road  vehicles including cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses and estimates exhaust and evaporative  emissions as well as brake and tire wear emissions from all types of on-road vehicles for any part  of the country, except California.  

The EPA officially released the MOVES3 model in January 2021 which is an enhancement from  previous on-road MOBILE emissions model (MOBILE6.2). Presently, MOVES incorporates  numerous new features and a number of performance improvements over the original version,  including the capability to compute non-road vehicle emissions. Compared to the previous  MOBILE model, MOVES incorporates the latest emissions data, more sophisticated calculation  algorithms, increased user flexibility, new software design, and other significant capabilities.  Notably, California requires the use of its own motor vehicle emissions model known as  EMFAC2017 (see  Section 5.4 ).  

MOVES requires various inputs (e.g., vehicle population, vehicle age distribution, vehicle miles  travelled [VMT], etc.) and depending on the geographical scale (i.e., national, county, or local) of  the assessment, default values may not be appropriate to use. In these cases, state and regional air  quality regulatory and transportation planning agencies should be consulted, as these agencies  might have more area-specific data. MOVES produces emission factors in grams of pollutant per  vehicle mile or grams per idle minute by hour of day or season.  

The EPA offers several guidance documents on the MOVES model that may be useful to the users  of this  Handbook . , , , ,  

NONROAD is a computerized database developed by the EPA to provide state, local, and tribal  air quality agencies with the ability to create and forecast emission inventories for certain nonroad  categories of emission sources, such as agricultural and construction equipment, all-terrain  recreational vehicles, marine equipment, lawn and garden equipment, and a variety of other off- road vehicles and equipment.  NONROAD does not address aircraft.  This model is available both  integrated into the MOVES model and as a standalone model. The required inputs vary by the type  of vehicle/equipment for which emissions estimates are sought. For airport applications,  NONROAD is used primarily for the estimation of emissions from GSE and construction-related  equipment. The EPA offers additional guidance documents on the NONROAD model that may be  useful to the users of this  Handbook .  

# 5.2.1.   ACEIT  

The Airport Construction Emissions Inventory Tool (ACEIT) is a software tool developed by the  Transportation Research Board (TRB) to bring consistency to airport construction emissions  inventories and to allow users to better understand and quantify airport construction emissions.  ACEIT enables users to rely upon default information about the construction process for typical  airport Federal Actions. The ACEIT Guidebook provides information to enhance user  understanding of the construction process and information needed to improve the quality of  emissions inventories developed by using default settings and data in the tool. Guidance on the  tool and ACEIT Guidebook is maintained on the TRB website.  ACEIT is based on emission  factors calculated by NONROAD, and at the time of preparing this  Handbook  has not been updated  with MOVES emission factors. Absent MOVES emission factors, this tool does not meet EPA  criteria of using emission models approved in Appendix W of 40 CFR Part 51.  Any use of the  ACEIT model should be limited to facilitating understanding of equipment usage relative to project  characteristics.  Consequently, any use of ACEIT is permissible only if such use is required by the  State and/or local air quality agency. State/local air quality agency requirement of the use of  ACEIT must be in writing.  

# 5.3.   AERMOD  

Developed by the EPA, AERMOD is an atmospheric dispersion model which can simulate point,  area, volume, and line sources of emissions and has the capability to include simple, intermediate,  and complex terrains.  It also predicts both short-term (1 to 24 hours) and long-term (quarterly  or annual) average concentrations. The model can be executed by using the regulatory default  options (e.g., stack-tip downwash, elevated terrain effects, calm wind speeds processing routine,  missing data processing routine, buoyancy-induced dispersion, and final plume rise), default wind  speed profile categories, default potential temperature gradients, and pollutant decay. Lastly,  AERMOD has the capability to account for building downwash effects and to employ gas or  particle deposition or wet/dry depletion of the plume. AERMOD is commonly executed to yield  1-hour and season average concentrations (in  $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$  ) at each receptor. These concentrations may  be presented as plot files or receptor files showing the results at each receptor for tabular and  graphical display.  

For a detailed discussion on AERMOD and dispersion modeling refer to  Section 7.1  (Atmospheric  Dispersion  Modeling)  and  Appendix W of 40 CFR 51 .  AERMOD model has been integrated into  AEDT, but when modeling non-aircraft sources, can be run independent of AEDT.  

# 5.4.   EMFAC & OFFROAD  

The EMFAC emissions model is developed and used by the California Air Resources Board  (CARB) to assess emissions from on-road vehicles including cars, trucks, and buses in California,  and to support CARB's regulatory and air quality planning efforts. USEPA has approved EMFAC  for use in State Implementation Plan and transportation conformity analyses 96 . CARB has also  released the OFFROAD model which calculates emissions from off-road sources of airport  construction equipment and GSE for projects in California. However, the OFFROAD model is  now being replaced by category specific methods and inventory models that are being developed  for specific regulatory support projects.  If a category is not listed, OFFROAD2007 is the current  model for estimating emissions for such category. A comprehensive web query tool,  OFFROAD2021 is available to access the most recent model outputs from all offroad categories.  

# 6.   Quantifying Emissions  

This section addresses the preparation of emissions inventories for three separate categories of  emissions: (i) criteria pollutants, (ii) hazardous air pollutants, and (iii) greenhouse gases.  

# 6.1.   Criteria Pollutants  

# 6.1.1.   Introduction & Background  

The purpose of this section is to identify and provide guidance on the various methods that are  available to Handbook users for assessing air quality conditions associated with aviation-related  Federal Actions. This section focuses on computing criteria pollutant emissions inventories  resulting from operational and construction activities for the aviation sector.  

# 6.1.2.   Existing Guidance  

The guidance documents listed in  Table 6-1  ( Historical Guidance on   Criteria Pollutant Emissions  Inventory Preparation ) reflect the historical development of the computation methodologies for  criteria pollutant emissions arising from an airport’s operations, as well as from construction  activities undertaken to improve airport facilities/operations. Details specific to an emissions  source or sources are provided for each listed guidance document.

# 6.1.3.   Airport Operations  

# 6.1.3.1.   Airport Operation Emission Inventory Methods  

Typical sources and activities addressed in a criteria pollutant emissions inventory of airport  operations include aircraft, APU, GSE, stationary sources, and ground access vehicle operations.  In general terms, a criteria pollutant emissions inventory is computed by combining pollutant  emissions factors with source activity levels; for instance, GSE emissions factors are expressed in  pounds of pollutant per horsepower-hour of operation, and are applied to a given GSE’s known  horsepower and operating schedule.  

Building on the foundations laid by the documents and methods referenced in  Table 6-1,  Historical Guidance on   Criteria Pollutant Emissions Inventory Preparation , this section discusses  considerations for preparing a criteria pollutant emissions inventory for airport operations,  including how the source(s) activity is typically characterized as well as how applicable emissions  model(s) such as AEDT apply emissions factors or otherwise translate that activity into an  emissions estimate. Construction emissions are addressed separately in  Section 6.1.4  ( Airport  Construction Emissions ). For additional information on how to populate AEDT to compute  aircraft, GSE, and APU emissions, please refer to the  AEDT Technical Manual .  

# Aircraft  

Fixed wing aircraft emissions for a criteria pollutant emissions inventory are computed in AEDT  by factoring total aircraft operational activity against a database of aircraft/engine-specific  emission factors based on engine manufacturer, model, and aircraft operational mode within the  landing and takeoff (LTO) cycle. For the purposes of emissions inventory, an LTO cycle consists  of the following operational modes:  

•   Approach : The airborne segment of an aircraft’s arrival extending from the start of the  flight profile (or the mixing height) to touchdown on the runway;  •   Taxi In : The landing ground roll segment (from touchdown to the runway exit) of an  arriving aircraft, including reverse thrust, and the taxiing from the runway exit to a gate;  •   Startup : Aircraft main engine startup (for VOC only) occurs at the gate and is considered  in AEDT for ICAO certified engines only;  •   Taxi Out : The taxiing from the gate to a runway end;  •   Takeoff : The portion from the start of the ground roll on the runway, through wheels off,  and the airborne portion of the ascent up to engine cutback during which the aircraft  operates at maximum thrust; and  •   Climb Out : The portion from engine cutback to the end of the flight profile or the mixing  height.  

AEDT calculation of emissions within the LTO relies on two main categories of input: (i) aircraft  fleet and operations, and (ii) time within each mode of the LTO cycle.  

# Aircraft Fleet and Operations  

At a minimum, AEDT requires that an aircraft fleet (i.e., the types of aircraft using the airport and  their assigned engines) be defined and a level of operations (i.e., either arrivals/departures/touch- and-gos, or LTO) be assigned to each member of the aircraft fleet. AEDT can accept varying levels  of detail depending on the extent to which aircraft operational parameters at a given airport are  available or known. These range from the selection of a generic aircraft fleet with “default” engines  selected by AEDT, to the identification of specific airframes and engines based on an air carrier’s  market information, to the modeling of individual flights based on flight schedules or radar data.  Typical sources of data that can be used to identify and define these parameters are described in  the  AEDT Technical Manual .  

# Aircraft LTO Cycle Emissions  

AEDT calculates emissions for the takeoff, approach, and climb out (i.e., the aloft) components of  the LTO cycle, based on aircraft flight profiles, characteristics of individual aircraft, and  meteorological conditions. Users are able to select from a series of profiles that reflect different  aircraft takeoff weights and takeoff power settings, or they can define custom profiles. In addition,  local meteorological data can be used. This allows for a more site-specific characterization of  emissions aloft. Fuel consumption and emissions can be modeled for the full flight in AEDT,  though only those emissions released below the atmospheric mixing height are typically  considered for a local air quality analysis. The mixing height is defined as the height of the  atmosphere where relatively vigorous mixing of pollutants and other gases takes place. Directly  above the mixing height, the atmosphere is fairly stable and there is limited vertical dispersion of  polluted air. The mixing height varies both diurnally and seasonally. For an emissions inventory,  the user specifies the average mixing height to be used by AEDT. For a dispersion analysis, the  mixing height is calculated automatically based on the hourly meteorological data that has been  provided.  

For aircraft emissions on the ground, the user can specify fixed taxi in and taxi out times by airport  average or by flight operation; but this is the lowest level of fidelity for modeling such emissions.  Using fixed times does not capture airport-specific operating parameters such as ground delay,  airfield configuration, ramp locations, variation in aircraft speed, and other important factors.  AEDT provides a higher-fidelity taxi modeling option. Users can define operational profiles that  reflect how the taxi times vary by quarter hour, day of the week, and month of the year in order to  reflect the regular temporal variability in taxi operations. AEDT also allows the user to define  paths to be used from gates to runway ends. Once this taxi network has been built, AEDT can  apply its delay and sequencing model to estimate the amount of time required for the aircraft to  taxi to and from the gate, accounting for the amount of traffic also operating on that part of the  airport.  

# Ground Support Equipment (GSE)  

GSE criteria pollutant emissions inventories using AEDT captures two distinct sets of GSE  utilization at an airport: (i) GSE servicing gated aircraft on the apron, and (ii) other activities of  the GSE population not tied to gate service operations. An example of a gate service operation is  a baggage tractor visiting an aircraft at the apron to drop off baggage; an example of a population  activity is a deicing truck driving back and forth to a deicing area during the deicing season.  

To compute GSE emissions, AEDT applies emissions factors (in grams per horsepower hour   $\mathrm{\Delta[g/hp-hr])}$  ) specific to the make/model, year of manufacture, approximate horsepower, and fuel type  of a given equipment to annual hours of operation for that equipment. These emissions calculations  are further adjusted using the observed horsepower of the equipment and the equipment’s average  percentage of full throttle (i.e., load factor). AEDT offers “default” values for many of these  parameters. AEDT also affords a user the choice to override them in the case that comprehensive  information on an airport’s GSE fleet is known.  

For GSE population activities, users need only specify the make/model, model year, horsepower,  fuel type, and annual hours of operation for a given piece of equipment (or accept AEDT’s default  information). This approach also applies to the gate service GSE. However, AEDT computes  annual hours of operation for gate service GSE by considering the number of aircraft LTOs for  which GSE service is provided and the total running time of the GSE per LTO.  

Calculation steps and input data necessary to compute GSE emissions in AEDT are further  explained in  FAA’s  Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) Technical Manual .  

# Auxiliary Power Units (APUs)  

AEDT automatically assigns most large commercial and cargo aircraft a representative make and  model of APU, if agency/industry documentation indicates that an APU is used on that aircraft.   Annual APU emissions are a function of the number of LTOs performed by the equipped aircraft,  the time the assigned APU operates per LTO, and the emissions factors assigned to the APU. When  assigning APU operating times per LTO, infrastructure considerations such as the availability of  fixed electrical ground power and pre-conditioned air, as well as meteorological conditions such  as the annual temperature in the area, should be considered as these variables factor into the  frequency and duration with which an APU is operated.  

# Stationary Sources  

Currently, AEDT can estimate criteria pollutant emissions from the following stationary sources  of air emissions, categorized based on whether the emissions occur from fuel combustion or from  passive, non-combustion processes such as evaporation or erosion:  

•   Combustion Sources -  Boilers and heaters, generators, snowmelters, incinerators, fire  training facilities, and aircraft engine testing; and    •   Non-Combustion Sources -  Fuel storage tanks, cooling towers, coating and painting  operations, de-icing and anti-icing operations, solvent degreasing, and salt and sand piles.  

For combustion-related stationary sources, activity levels in the form of an operating schedule  (e.g., annual hours of operation) or a mass of fuel consumed (e.g., annual cubic feet of natural gas)  are factored against appropriate emissions factors to derive an emissions inventory. For non- combustion sources, the activity levels required for an emissions calculation relate to a number of  factors including (but not limited to) the level of material or fuel moved through or stored within  the device, the dimensions and size of the device, and the application area over which a substance  is applied.  

EPA’s  AP-42 Compilation of Air Emission Factors  contains detailed data input requirements and  calculation steps used to compute emissions from all of the combustion and non-combustion  stationary sources identified in this section.  

# Ground Access Vehicles  

Motor vehicle criteria pollutant emissions inventories typically focus on three distinct types of  activities: (i) vehicles traversing airport roadways; (ii) vehicles accessing parking facilities; and  (iii) vehicles accessing the terminal curbside areas for passenger pickup and drop-off.  

The EPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) is the current federally-approved tool  to compute motor vehicle emissions rates representative of the types of activities specified above.  Using locally developed data on vehicle types, fuel types, vehicle ages, inspection and  maintenance programs, and other factors, MOVES will generate emissions rates in grams of  pollutant per vehicle mile of travel   $\mathrm{(g/VMT)}$   or grams per vehicle hour of operation (g/hour)  

against which airport motor vehicle activities can be applied. See EPA’s latest MOVES User Guide  for further details on how best to use MOVES for specific applications.  

In order to use MOVES emission rate information to estimate roadway emissions, the VMT must  first be calculated for each type of vehicle, and those VMTs must be apportioned for each speed  that the vehicle operates at (e.g., separate VMT for all passenger cars, all diesel shuttles, CNG  buses, etc.). These calculations will be a function of the traffic volumes for a given type of vehicle,  the road segment speed, and the length of the roadway segment. The total VMTs for each vehicle  type can be quantified based on either traffic counts and fleet mix assumptions or planning  assumptions. By factoring a vehicle type’s VMT against its corresponding emissions factor in   $\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{V}\mathbf{M}\mathrm{T}$  , a total mass of pollutant is obtained.  

Travel-based VMT that is computed for parking and curbside activities is converted to a total mass  of pollutant(s). However, a considerable portion of the motor vehicle emissions attributable to  parking and curbside activities are caused by vehicle idling. So, in addition to computing a VMT  for the parking and curbside areas when a vehicle is in motion, an emissions inventory also derives  or estimates the total number of hours spent at idling for each vehicle type and for each parking  facility/curbside area, and apply the appropriate g/hour emissions rate to produce a total mass of  pollutant. By summing the travel emissions based on VMT and the idling emissions based on hours  of operation, a total emissions inventory of roadway, parking and curbside motor vehicle activities  is obtained.  

# 6.1.3.2.   Airport Operation Emissions Inventory Results  

Once the assessment is complete, an operational criteria pollutant emissions inventory is typically  documented using the example template shown in  Table 6-2 ,  Operational Emissions Inventory  Results , which summarizes the total emissions, in tons of pollutant per year of operation,  by  emissions source. This example also highlights how emissions should be summarized in FAA  NEPA documents to compare the proposed action alternatives against the No Action alternative  and assess the level of emissions increase (or decrease) that would occur. Refer to  Section 8 ( Conformity ) for details on how to relate this emissions increase (or decrease) to CAA analysis.  

![Table 6-2. Operational Emissions Inventory Results  ](images/45c7d4a14dc9d1caaa10b30df084eb7e274b2fc812b951ff8fda411c3d35713e.jpg)  
98     “Using MOVES with AEDT” provides guidance on this topic -   https://aedt.faa.gov/3d_information.aspx .  99     For conformity analyses the various inventories (i.e., operations, construction) need to be converted into tons per  year.  

# 6.1.4.   Airport Construction Emissions  

Although comparatively short-term in duration, construction-related air emissions can have an  impact on both local air quality conditions and on the regional airshed. Moreover, construction  emissions are classified as "direct" sources of emissions under the CAA General Conformity rule  (see  Section 8 ,  Conformity ) .  As a result, these emissions must be quantified, and in some cases  mitigated, in nonattainment/maintenance areas in order to meet the requirements of the General  Conformity rule. In attainment areas, construction-related emissions are evaluated following the  flow chart in  Section 4  for disclosure purposes only under NEPA.  

This section provides recommended approaches for assessing construction emissions associated  with FAA Federal Actions. EPA’s MOVES2014a Users Guide (Construction Emission Inventory  for Criteria Pollutants) provides additional information on these emissions including emissions  inventory methods and equations, data sources and other supporting materials.  

# 6.1.4.1.   Construction Emissions Inventory Methods  

Construction-related emissions are primarily associated with the exhaust from heavy equipment  (e.g., backhoes, bulldozers, graders, etc.), delivery trucks (e.g., cement trucks, dump trucks, etc.),  and construction worker vehicles traveling to, from, and moving around the site, as well as fugitive  dust from site preparation, land clearing, material handling, and demolition activities.  Construction  emissions are also produced by the storage/transportation of raw materials, the disposal of  construction debris and the production of asphalt or concrete.  These emissions are temporary in  nature (i.e., during the construction period only) and generally confined to the construction site  and the access/egress roadways. Other types of fugitive emissions (e.g., asphalt off-gassing, etc.)  occur in construction but are relatively insignificant and included on a case-by-case basis.  

Typically, emissions from construction activities are estimated based on the construction activity  schedule for the Federal Action, the number and types of vehicles/pieces of equipment needed, the  types of fuel used, and the vehicle/equipment utilization rates.  

Emission factors for on-road vehicles (e.g., passenger cars, pickup trucks, haul trucks, etc.) can be  obtained from the EPA  MOVES 100   emissions model or the California OFFROAD emissions model  (for projects in California). The emission factors should be developed in  accordance with  appropriate state, local, or tribal regulatory guidelines. For on-road vehicles, the anticipated VMT  should be determined or estimated to compute emissions.  

Emission factors for off-road equipment (e.g., dump trucks, dozers, graders, etc.) can also be  obtained from the EPA MOVES   emissions model or the California OFFROAD emissions model  (for  projects  in California).  For off-road equipment, the expected equipment size, hours of  operation, and load factors are required or need to be estimated.  

An alternative approach when precision is not required is to use the- ACEIT emission estimating  tool (see description of limitations in  Section 5.2.1 ). This model takes input on project size and  type of product to calculate criteria pollutant emissions. The simplicity of the model inputs affects  the accuracy of the calculation, but for circumstances where the quantification demonstrates that  the emissions are not anywhere close to a regulatory threshold, the results can be sufficient. It is  recommended that use of such an alternative approach be discussed with state, local, or tribal air  quality offices before being used.  

Fugitive dust emissions can be computed from emission factors contained within EPA’s  Compilation of Air Pollution Emission Factors  (i.e., AP-42).  These factors are combined with  project-specific values representing areas of disturbance, volumes of materials processed and/or  dust control measure efficiencies.  

# 6.1.4.2.   Construction Emissions Inventory Results  

For consistency with the operational emissions inventory and for direct comparison to the General  Conformity  de minimis  levels, construction emissions inventory results should also be reported in  tons per year.  Table 6-3  ( Construction Emissions Inventory Results)  provides a sample format for  reporting these emissions. For simplification, total values are shown for each pollutant,  construction year and alternative evaluated.  

![Table 6-3. Construction Emissions Inventory Results  ](images/a754926e7a0bdf2fb3020962d0d1654ad841aa5a4486d46d473b2a800a91c5d8.jpg)  

# 6.2.   Hazardous Air Pollutants  

Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are pollutants for which there are no NAAQS, but are still  regulated under the federal CAA because of their potentially adverse effects on human health and  the environment. There is no regulatory requirement for FAA to prepare an emissions inventory  of HAPs, but FAA may decide to prepare such an inventory when there is significant public interest  in this issue. Also known as “air toxics,” these pollutants are comprised of a wide array of organic  and inorganic compounds (e.g., formaldehyde, diesel particulate matter, acetaldehyde, benzene,  toluene, acrolein, 1,3-Butadiene, xylene, lead, naphthalene, propionaldehyde). Such emissions are  present as trace components in the exhaust of aircraft, GSE/APUs, and motor vehicle engines and,  to a lesser extent, from boilers, fuel facilities, and other stationary sources.  Section 3  ( Sources and  Types of Emissions ) identifies and generally describes these emissions as they pertain to aviation.  

This section addresses the available approaches for assessing HAPs in connection with FAA  Federal Actions. The AEDT model is the preferred tool for creating HAPs emission inventories.  

# 6.2.1.   Introduction & Background  

The EPA has identified 188 air pollutants 102  that are considered to be HAPs and therefore subject  to the requirements of Section 112 ( Hazardous Air Pollutants ) 103  of the CAA. From this list of 188  HAPs, 33 have been further designated by the EPA as having the greatest potential health threat  to the general public in the largest number of urban areas and are known as “Section 112(k)  HAPs.” 104  The major categories of HAPs in this group include volatile and semi-volatile organic  compounds (i.e., VOCs, SVOCs) and heavy metals.  

In a related matter, the EPA has identified 21 HAPs that are designated as Mobile Source Air  Toxics (MSATs) 105  to signify those HAPs that are emitted by motor vehicles and non-road engines   (e.g., farm and construction equipment, heavy industrial vehicles, GSE, etc.). These pollutants  include VOCs and heavy metals that are commonly associated with the combustion of gasoline  and diesel fuels - including those emitted by aviation-related motor vehicles and GSE.  

Other sources of HAPs associated with airports are similarly regulated under Section 112 of the  CAA if their emissions exceed established thresholds and they meet the definition of a major  stationary or area source. These may include aircraft repair and maintenance facilities, engine test  cells, central heating plants, painting operations, and other airport support services that generate  air emissions.  

Importantly, neither airports nor aircraft are specifically included among the source types regulated  pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA (42 U.S.C   $\S~7412)$   nor do they meet the definitions of the  source types (i.e., “major stationary,” “area,” or “mobile sources”) that are specifically covered  under this section. Rather, all emissions from aircraft engines are currently regulated under Part B  ( Aircraft Emission Standards ) 106  of the CAA. Therefore, although aircraft HAPs are not directly  regulated under the CAA, they are indirectly controlled as elements of total unburned  hydrocarbons (HC) and PM pursuant to Part B.  

# 6.2.2.   FAA Guidance  

In 2003, the FAA undertook a review of publicly available information pertaining to the  relationship(s) between aircraft and airport-related activities and the emissions of HAPs. This  initial body of work focused on those emissions specifically identified by the EPA as HAPs and  was prepared in response to the rising interest by various federal, state, local, and tribal  governmental agencies and the general public in connection with these pollutants. Referred to as  the  FAA Resource Document for HAPs , this initial report was entitled and is described as follows:  

•   Select Resource Materials and Annotated Bibliography on the Topic of Hazardous Air  Pollutants (HAPs) Associated with Aircraft, Airports and Aviation.  

Among the key findings from this initial publication was the need for a more unified  approach and technical guidelines for evaluating HAPs emissions for aviation-related  

sources. Other topics include HAP types and sources, agency regulations, and air  monitoring data associated with airports and aviation.  

In response to this need for more information, in 2009, the EPA and the FAA developed organic  gas (OG) speciation profiles and best practices for use in HAPs emission inventories of aircraft  equipped with turbofan, turbojet, and turboprop engines fueled with kerosene-based jet-A fuel.  The  development  of these profiles and guidance was the combined work of both agencies, taking  into account the most recent data and information available. Referred to as the  Speciated Organic  Gas Emissions from Aircraft Guidance , this document is entitled and described as follows:  

•   Recommended Best Practice for Quantifying Speciated Organic Gas Emissions from  Aircraft Equipped with Turbofan, Turbojet, and Turboprop Engines.  

The aircraft-related speciation profile developed from this initiative was used to update the  OG profile for aircraft in the EPA SPECIATE database – the agency’s multi-sector  repository for such data.  In this application, a  speciation profile  is the amount of OGs  emitted based on the amount of VOCs emitted by an emission source.  

Again in 2009, the FAA published a document providing an approach to, and technical guidance  for, preparing speciated OG emission inventories for airport sources including aircraft, APUs,  GSE, motor vehicles, and stationary sources. Referred to as the  Speciated Organic Gas Emissions  from Airports Guidance , this document is entitled and described as follows:  

•   Guidance for Quantifying Speciated Organic Gas Emissions from Airport Sources.  

This guidance is intended to help ensure that OG/HAPs emission inventories prepared in  support of environmental documents prepared by, or on behalf of, the FAA under NEPA  are done so consistently. Importantly, it points out that emission inventories of aviation- related OGs, which include the OGs identified by the EPA to be HAPs and the OGs listed  in the EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS),  are not required by current EPA  regulations.  However, in those cases where it is desirable to prepare such an aviation- related HAP inventory, the inventory should be prepared following this guidance and using  AEDT.  

The FAA also recognized that the need to prepare an emissions inventory of OGs/HAPS is not  widely instituted nor uniformly applied in connection with FAA Federal Actions. To address this  discrepancy, FAA has provided a flow chart in the  Guidance for Quantifying Speciated Organic  Gas Emissions from Airport Sources  document that can be used to determine when an emissions  inventory of OGs/HAPs should be prepared.  

For FAA NEPA reviews, if a CATEX is applicable to the Federal Action and no extraordinary  circumstance exists, then preparation of a HAPs emissions inventory is not warranted. As  described in Section 4.5.1 on pollutant quantification, there are a limited number of instances when  the proposed Federal Action requiring an EA or EIS should consider including a HAP emissions  inventory. Furthermore, considerations should be given as to (i) whether the Federal Action  normally requires an EIS (e.g., new airport, new runway, major runway extension, etc.); (ii)  whether or not it is located in a nonattainment/maintenance area; and/or (iii) whether a criteria air  pollutant emissions inventory is also prepared. In those cases where the magnitude of the project  is uncertain, a HAP emissions inventory may also be prepared when called for during agency  scoping or based on consultation with the appropriate FAA regional office.  

# 6.2.3.   HAPs Emissions Inventory Methods  

Again, it is important to acknowledge that there are currently no federal regulatory guidelines  specific to HAPs emissions from aircraft engines, specifically, and airports, in general. While the  methodology discussed in this  Handbook  is useful for disclosure, reporting, and comparative  purposes, it does not provide results that are directly comparable to any regulatory threshold or air  quality standards.  

It is also important to note that other than an emissions inventory, a HAPs assessment prepared for  the FAA would not include any other type of analysis including, but not limited to, atmospheric  dispersion modeling, toxicity weighting, or human health risk analyses. These types of assessments  require a more complete understanding of the reactions of HAPs in the atmosphere and  downstream plume evolution as well as human exposure patterns. Because the science of these  relationships with respect to aviation-related HAPs is still evolving, the corresponding level of  understanding is also currently limited. Prior to including any such assessment in a project scope,  FAA field staff should coordinate with AEE-300.  

As stated previously, in cases where it is desirable to prepare such an aviation-related HAP  inventory, the inventory must be prepared following the  Guidance for Quantifying Speciated  Organic Gas Emissions from Airport Sources  and using AEDT. In this application, AEDT applies  speciation factors to quantify individual HAP compounds. These factors estimate the quantities of  individual HAPs based on the total emissions of VOCs. Notably, the EPA MOVES emission factor  model should be used to develop individual HAP speciation data for motor vehicles.  

Presently, AEDT calculates emissions for a large array of different OGs. Of these, several dozen  are classified as HAPs by the EPA while the remainder are considered to be non-toxic compounds.  The HAPs are listed in  Table 6-4  ( Potential HAPs to be Included in an Airport Emissions  Inventory ).  

![Table 6-4. Potential HAPs to be Included in an Airport Emissions Inventory  ](images/4089b88d3e9a23760cd4f3284f17587ab9b3840d9f73989137c47b42e8b6f50f.jpg)  

![](images/966f22b5846ad4516840a3cb849f502a082ab1714cbd803e7416f1873a30a8ca.jpg)  

Importantly, the type(s) and number of HAPs reported in an aviation-related emissions inventory  will depend on the type of airport sources that are evaluated and, in some cases, the type of fuel  and other emission characteristics of the individual source(s) involved.  

For most airport emission inventories, formaldehyde occurs in the greatest amounts followed by  acetaldehyde, acrolein, and 1,3-butadiene. These compounds are emitted in the exhaust of aircraft,  APUs, GSE, and motor vehicle engines and, to a lesser extent, from boilers, fuel facilities, and  other stationary sources at an airport. Compounds such as benzene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene,  toluene, hexane, styrene, and xylene also occur, but in far lesser amounts.  

# 6.2.4.   HAPs Emissions Inventory Results  

As discussed previously, for HAPs emission inventories prepared as part of a NEPA analysis, the  emphasis is on disclosing the incremental change in HAPs emissions between the proposed action  (and alternatives) when compared to the no-action alternative. For consistency, HAPs emission  inventories should also be reported in tons per year.  Table 6-5  ( HAPs Emissions Inventory Results )   provides a sample   format for reporting HAP emissions. For simplification, total values are shown  for each species of HAPs evaluated and comprise combined emissions from aircraft, APUs, GSE,  motor vehicles, stationary sources, and fuel storage facilities.  

![Table 6-5. HAPs Emissions Inventory Results  ](images/c4e5afa200bf876081992e19296736caa9e5837c3b0a641f01abcf0a90ff5a4b.jpg)  
It is again noteworthy that the HAPs emissions inventory results are not compared to the NAAQS  or any  other  significance criteria. Rather, the information is provided for informational purposes  as a means of disclosing the Federal Action’s potential effects on HAPs.  

# 6.3.   Greenhouse Gases  

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are another category of  pollutants  for which there are no NAAQS but  are of concern because of their climate-changing potential.  Section 3  ( Sources and Types of Air  Emissions ) identifies and generally describes these emissions as they pertain to aviation. These  include gases such as CO 2 , CH 4 , and   $\mathrm{N}_{2}\mathrm{O}$   as by-products of fuel combustion in aircraft, APU,  GSE, and motor vehicle engines as well as emissions of HFCs, PFCs, and SF 6  linked with  refrigeration and air conditioning.  

This section addresses the available guidance and approaches for assessing these emissions in  connection with FAA Federal Actions.  

# 6.3.1.   Introduction & Background  

There is a broad scientific consensus that human activities, primarily in the form of GHGs, are  contributing to changes in the earth’s atmosphere, resulting in impacts such as rising oceanic  temperatures, rising sea levels, and increased incidences of severe weather events, among others.   These GHGs, brought about principally by the combustion and release of fossil fuels,  decomposition of waste materials, and deforestation, cause the “greenhouse effect” that leads to  “global climate change” that has been observed worldwide.  

As a result, the scientific community is continuing its efforts to better understand the impact of  aviation  emissions  on the global atmosphere. In particular, the FAA is leading and participating in  a number of initiatives intended to clarify the role that aviation plays in GHG emissions and  climate. For example, the FAA, with support from the U.S. Global Change Research Program  (GCRP) 113  and its participating federal agencies (i.e., NASA, NOAA, EPA, DOT, and DOE),   has developed the Aviation Climate Change Research Initiative (ACCRI) 115  in an effort to advance  scientific understanding of the regional and global climate impacts of aircraft emissions. This  effort also seeks to quantify uncertainties for current and projected aviation scenarios under  changing atmospheric conditions.  The FAA also funded the Partnership for Air Transportation  Noise & Emissions Reduction (PARTNER) and subsequently the Center of Excellence for  alternative jet fuels and environment (ASCENT) research initiatives to quantify the effects of  aircraft exhaust and contrails on global and U.S. climate and atmospheric composition. Similar  research topics are being examined at the international level by the ICAO.  

In terms of U.S. contributions, the U.S. 2021 Aviation Climate Action Plan establishes a goal of  “ Net-Zero GHG Emissions from the U.S. Aviation Sector by 2050. ” 118  Importantly, actions are  underway within the U.S. and by other nations to reduce aviation's contribution of GHGs. Such  actions, which are in varying degrees of development, include new aircraft technologies to reduce  emissions and improve fuel efficiency, renewable alternative fuels with lower carbon footprints,  more efficient air traffic management, FAA airport-reduction programs, market- based  measures,  and environmental regulations, including an aircraft   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   standard.  

# 6.3.2.   FAA NEPA Guidance  

FAA’s guidance for assessing and reporting upon climate change and GHGs in NEPA documents  is included in the  Appendix to this Handbook .  It is important to note that while criteria pollutants  only need to be considered below the mixing height, GHGs need to be considered for the full range  of impacts being examined in a Federal Action and that may require analyzing emissions above  the mixing height.  The Appendix to this Handbook is subject to change, so please reference the  Appendix regularly to ensure use of the most current guidance.  

On January 9, 2023, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued interim guidance for   public comment, entitled  National Environmental Policy Act Guidance on Consideration of  Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change  (2023 Interim Guidance) establishing uniform  practices for assessing the effects of GHG and climate change effects of proposed federal projects  pursuant to NEPA.  The 2023 Interim Guidance provided guidance to practitioners on multiple  aspects of GHG analyses, including when and how GHGs should be quantified, the  contextual iz ation of GHGs, analysis of reasonable alternatives, mitigation of GHG emissions, and  engagement with environmental justice communities. The guidance in the Appendix currently is  focused on only two elements of the 2023 Interim Guidance: 1) quantification of GHG emissions;  and 2) contextual iz ation of GHG emissions.   On May 1, 2024, CEQ issued its final rule  (Phase 2 Rule) updating its NEPA implementing regulations. The Phase 2 Rule re- affirms that environmental documents should include analysis of “Where applicable,  climate change-related effects, including, where feasible, quantification of  greenhouse gas emissions, from the proposed action and alternatives and the effects  of climate change on the proposed action and alternatives” (see 40 CFR   $\S$  1502.16(a)(6)).  

For questions on how to conduct the GHG assessment and discuss the results, please contact AEE.  Please note that additional documentation, beyond that recommended in the Appendix, may be  needed to comply with state, local, or tribal requirements.  

# 6.3.3.   Methodology  

In general, FAA’s GHG emissions inventory procedures are intended to accomplish the following:  

•   Identify and characterize the types and sources of GHGs to include in an emissions  inventory.  •   Apply appropriate and consistent methods for calculating GHG emission inventories.  •   Aid in the integration of GHG inventories into larger regional, national, and global  inventories.  •   Clarify the specific makeup and percent contribution of applicant-generated GHGs, by  source and emission type.  •   Provide necessary inputs for contextualizing GHG emissions and climate effects using the  social costs of greenhouse gas emissions (SC-GHG) methodology as described in the  Appendix to this Handbook. This contextual iz ation method translates the metric tones of  emissions for a project into a monetary value that describes the net social costs of  increasing GHG emissions as well as the net social benefits of reducing such emissions.  

# 6.3.4.   GHG Emissions Inventory Methods  

As discussed in  Section 3  ( Sources and Types of Air Emissions ), the primary sources of GHG  emissions that are typical of most FAA Federal Actions include aircraft, APUs, GSE, an  assortment of stationary sources, and motor vehicles (operating on the airport’s internal roadways,  parking facilities and terminal curbsides, and off-airport roadways). For the most part, emissions  from these sources arise from the combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., jet fuel, avgas, diesel, gasoline,  CNG, etc.) and are emitted as by-products contained in the engine exhaust.  

Because GHG emissions are primarily a function of fossil fuel use, most of the emission  calculations for  each  source are based on estimating or obtaining fuel use (or activity) data and  then applying the appropriate GHG emission factor (i.e., pounds per gallon or grams per mile  traveled), as follows:  

#  $G H G\,e m i s s i o n s=(F u e l\,U s e\,o r\,A c t i v i t y\,L e\nu e l)\;x\;(E m i s s i o n\,A s e e n s i o n).T h e t w o r k s t o t h e c o m p o s s i t i o n$  

For example, when calculating aircraft-related GHG emissions, fuel use can be obtained from  airport fuel throughput data for jet fuel and avgas or computed from AEDT. Importantly, GHG  emissions beyond the mixing height of the study area (i.e., cruise mode) may need to be calculated  if these are relevant potential impacts from the Federal Action being considered in the NEPA  analysis. For APU GHG emissions, fuel use can be obtained from manufacturer fuel flow rates.  These data can  then  be converted to GHG emissions using appropriate emission factors for each  fuel type (e.g., jet fuel, avgas, etc.).  There is an array of tools 120  that can be used, some of the more  common approaches include:  

GHGs from GSE can be computed from fuel use and/or operational time from the EPA MOVES  model (or  airport  records) and then combined with fuel-specific emission factors (e.g., gasoline,  diesel, CNG, etc.).  

Similarly, the EPA MOVES model provides GHG emission factors for a variety of motor vehicle  types and  operating  speeds. These emission factors are typically reported in grams per mile  traveled and can be combined with aviation-related motor vehicle traffic volumes to determine  GHG emissions.  

GHG  emissions  from stationary sources are also largely based on fuel throughput data combined  with emission factors for each fuel type (e.g., diesel, natural gas, etc.).  

GHG emissions associated with the onsite generation of electricity using coal, oil, natural gas, etc.  may be  included  in an aviation-related GHG emissions inventory. Typically, these values are based  on aviation-related electrical usage and emission factors from local utilities or from the EPA  eGRID 121  system.  

The GHG emissions associated with refrigeration and heating and air-conditioning systems as well  as the GHG emissions from recycling of solid waste associated with an airport are likewise  occasionally included. These values are based mostly on product-specific material-balancing  methods and emission factors which take into account the use and disposal of these materials.  

Moreover, the storage of fuel (e.g., jet fuel, avgas, gasoline, and diesel) is a potential source of  evaporative  hydrocarbon  emissions, but does not produce the type of HCs that contribute directly  to global climate change.  

Due to the fact that   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  ,   $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$  , and   $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   are by-products of fuel combustion, they are also the  predominant GHGs associated with most Federal Actions. Emissions of HFCs, PFCs, and   $\mathrm{SF_{6}}$  linked with refrigeration, air conditioning, and other coolants also occur, but at far lesser amounts.  

Table 6-6  provides a summary of the emissions inventory methods.

# 6.3.5.   GHG Emissions Inventory Results  

As discussed above, the Appendix to this Handbook provides guidance on the quantification of  aviation-related GHG  emissions  inventories and contextualizing the emissions by preparing the  social cost of greenhouse gasses. It is recommended that GHG emission inventories should be  reported both for individual GHGs and in MT   $\mathrm{CO2e}$  .  

For the quantification of GHG emission  prepared as part of a NEPA analysis, the emphasis is on  disclosing the incremental change in GHG emissions between the proposed action (and  alternatives) when compared to the no-action alternative and providing context for those emissions  in terms of the social cost of greenhouse gasses (a monetary estimate of costs for their emission).  Table 6-7  provides a sample   format for reporting GHG emissions and the Appendix to this  Handbook provides examples of contextualizing the social cost of carbon computation  methodology and reporting instructions  

![Table 6-7. Quantification of GHG Emissions for NEPA Documents  ](images/a025b911863c44bd4cf0ad3149a49189335081fdba91eb42e2eb75a3f1d178db.jpg)

Note that the GHG emissions inventory results are not compared to the NAAQS nor any other  significance criteria. As previously mentioned, while criteria pollutants only need to be considered  below the mixing height, GHGs need to be considered above that level.  

# 7.   Conducting Dispersion Modeling for Criteria Air  Pollutants  

This section addresses two types of atmospheric dispersion modeling conducted in support of FAA  Federal A ctions : (i) multi-source dispersion modeling for operational and construction activities  and (ii) hot-spot roadway dispersion modeling. It is noted that dispersion modeling generally is  only appropriate when required by General Conformity or Transportation Conformity  requirements and thus it is important to carefully evaluate if and when it is appropriate.  

# 7.1.   Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling for Airports  

This section discusses the recommended approaches for conducting and reporting atmospheric  dispersion  modeling of aviation-related emissions in connection with FAA Federal Actions. EPA’s  Appendix W to 40 CFR Part 51  provides additional information on dispersion modeling  methods, data requirements, and other supporting materials.  

# 7.1.1.   Introduction & Background  

In general terms, dispersion modeling is the process by which the dispersal of atmospheric  pollutants are  simulated  and assessed under the effects of meteorological, terrain, and other  influencing factors. Computer models such as the American Meteorological Society/EPA  Regulatory Model (AERMOD) have been developed and are used for this purpose. The results of  this modeling allow for the prediction of pollutant concentrations at or near an emission source(s)  and enable the comparison of these results to the NAAQS.  It is important to understand that  dispersion modeling is normally conducted as one approach to demonstrating General Conformity  for certain localized criteria air pollutants.  The other requirement to perform dispersion  modeling would be for a project level conformity hot spot analysis required by the Transportation  Conformity requirements.   If neither of these two regulatory requirements apply to a project, it  is recommended that FAA’s Office of Emissions (AEE-300) be consulted prior to including  dispersion modeling in an environmental analysis. It is noted that 40 CFR 93.158 does not include  a dispersion modeling methodology for reactive pollutants (e.g. ozone) to demonstrate conformity.  

# 7.1.2.   EPA Guidance  

EPA’s principal  guidance  for conducting dispersion modeling and assessing air quality impacts on  nearby receptors is  Appendix W to Part 51  -  Guideline on Air Quality Models.  This guidance  contains recommendations and supporting information on the selection and applications of air  quality models, determining background concentrations and the use of meteorological data. This  guidance also specifies dispersion models required to be used for SIP revisions, general  conformity, and for New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)  programs.  

Notably, dispersion modeling requirements and methodologies may vary by purpose and/or locale,  thus state,  regional, and/or tribal  air quality regulatory agencies should be consulted on the  methodology, assumptions, and data sources utilized.  

However, as discussed previously in  Section 5  ( Air Quality Assessment Models ), the FAA’s AEDT  is the required model for performing air quality assessments of aviation-related sources in support  of FAA projects/ actions.  Coupled with AERMOD, AEDT computes spatially- and temporally- allocated emissions associated with airport activities and estimates the resulting pollutant  concentrations.  

In brief, AERMOD can simulate emission sources as point, area, volume, and line sources over  simple, intermediate,  and  complex terrains. It also has the capability to predict both maximum  short-term (i.e., 1 to 24 hours) and average long-term (i.e., quarterly or annual) concentrations. In  order to support all criteria of  Appendix W to 40 CFR 51 , AERMOD contains preprocessors,  including AERMET,  AERMAP,  and AERSURFACE 128  for the processing of meteorological  and terrain data.  

The EPA’s principal  guidance  documents for using AERMOD are listed below and described as  follows:  

•   User’s Guide for the AERMOD  – Addresses the regulatory application of AERMOD for  assessing criteria pollutants under the CAA.   •   AERMOD Implementation Guide  – Provides information on the recommended use of  AERMOD and addresses specific topics such as meteorological data processing, terrain  processing, urban environment applications, and source release characteristics. 130   •   AERMOD: Description of Model Formulation  – Provides a comprehensive and detailed  description of the technical formulation of AERMOD and its preprocessors.  

•   AERSURFACE User’s Guide  – Aids in the determination of land surface characteristics  based on land use cover, soil moisture, and seasonal conditions for use in AERMET.  

•   User’s Guide for the AERMOD Meteorological Preprocessor (AERMET)  – Provides a  methodology to process and organize meteorological data into a format suitable for use by  the AERMOD.   •   User’s Guide for the AERMOD Terrain Preprocessor (AERMAP)  – Provides a physical  relationship between terrain features and the behavior of air pollution plumes. 134  

# 7.1.3.   Dispersion Modeling Methods  

Typically, the first step in dispersion modeling is to compile detailed information on the emission  sources being modeled. This information includes the source emission rates (including temporal  variations), release characteristics, location coordinates, and source layout. For an airport, these  emission source data  may  take the form of an aircraft fleet mix, runway and taxiway locations,  gate assignments, stack height, and airport operational profiles.  

Second, representative meteorological information is required, typically obtainable from publicly- available databases; this data includes wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric stability (i.e.,  surface roughness,  albedo , and Bowen Ratio). For those locations with variable terrain, local  topographic data may also be required. Similarly, locations of interest are identified, and pollutant  concentrations are computed at those locations by defining those locations as “receptors” to the  model.  

Finally, appropriate background concentrations are added to the computed concentrations to  represent the contributions from all other emission sources within the study area. In the event that  conservatively assuming that all oxides of nitrogen are emitted as  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   is too cautious, the technical  analysis should be enhanced to examine of NO 2  concentrations by considering the conversion of  nitric oxide (NO) to NO 2 .  

For clarity, this  multi -step process of setting up and running a dispersion model such as AERMOD  for aviation-related sources is summarized as follows:  

•   Select model options  – Model options include averaging periods, pollutant types, urban vs.  rural setting, receptor layout, and data output format.  •   Select emission source characteristics  – Develop source release conditions for point, area,  line, and volume sources including emission rate, stack height and diameter, exhaust  temperature and exit velocity, source length and width, and volume height above ground  level. Also, source locations are to be provided to create a spatial relationship between  sources and receptors. These are generally calculated by the AEDT model for aircraft  sources.  

•   Select meteorological data  – Develop meteorological data such as wind speed, wind  direction, turbulence indices, temperature, and relative humidity using the AERMET  processor and surface/upper air data from the nearest representative monitoring station.  •   Select terrain data  – Digital elevation data is used to determine elevations for sources and  receptors using AERMAP and account for wind and plume behavior associated with terrain  features (this feature is not available in AEDT, but can be used with AERMOD).  •   Select receptor site locations  – The locations at which concentrations are estimated are  known as receptors. Generally, receptors are located where the general public is likely to  have continuous access.  •   Determine background concentrations  – Background concentrations are typically obtained  from a representative background monitoring site not affected by the modeled emission  source(s).  •   Tabulate results  – Representative background concentrations should be added to the model  predicted concentrations.  

For airport  applications , the typical AERMOD input requirements and their corresponding data  parameters are listed in  Table 7-1  ( AERMOD Model Inputs and Data Requirements ).  

![Table 7-1. AERMOD Model Inputs and Data Requirements  ](images/581b14d53b4ee09c11b3b91d9e4b78b2f1e21f48095390091940e9fcadc10753.jpg)  

![](images/d7430c008a51dc7917898a81e8edcb73828032ae4d01a369651658a43c8efa9f.jpg)  

When dispersion modeling is conducted at airports for the criteria pollutants, CO,  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$  , PM 10 , and  PM 2.5  are most commonly evaluated. Characteristically, CO levels are typically elevated in areas  of high motor vehicle traffic such as the main terminal area access/egress roadways, curbsides,  and  parking  facilities. By comparison, NO 2  concentrations are more likely to be highest near the  runway ends where aircraft engine thrust settings are at their highest.   $\mathrm{PM}_{10}$   and PM 2.5  levels are  generally more ubiquitous across the airport but similarly elevated near areas of high activity levels  and/or emission sources within close proximity to each other.  

Dispersion modeling of   $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$   and  $\mathrm{Pb}$   are much less frequently conducted due to their expected low  ambient levels. Elevated Pb concentrations are not usually associated with commercial airports but  may be found  near  airports with significant avgas usage. Ozone is a regional pollutant resulting  from the combined effects of VOCs and   $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$   in the presence of sunlight and thus not suitable for  dispersion modeling.  

# 7.1.4.   Dispersion Modeling Results  

Normally for airport applications, the output of the dispersion model is the maximum or average  concentration(s) of a pollutant (or set of pollutants) at each receptor analyzed and over a specified  time  period  (i.e., 1-, 3-, 8-, 24-hour to annual). These time periods typically correspond to the same  pollutant-specific time periods stipulated as part of the NAAQS.  

For FAA NEPA reviews, reporting the results of dispersion modeling is primarily intended to  disclose the differences in pollutant concentrations between the proposed action (and alternatives)  when compared to the no action alternative and to demonstrate that the action does not cause any  violations of the NAAQS. For the purposes of General Conformity, the principal intent of  dispersion modeling is to show that the Federal Action will not cause or contribute to a violation  of any NAAQS nor delay the attainment of any NAAQS.  Table 7-2  provides a sample   format for  reporting dispersion modeling results in support of FAA Federal Actions for an array of pollutants  that all are being evaluated pursuant to 40 CFR 93.158 (a)(3)(i). As previously described, General  Conformity does not require dispersion modeling of attainment pollutants nor nonattainment  pollutants not demonstrating conformity pursuant to this section. As shown, the results are  typically presented in   $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$  , although they can also be reported as ppm.  In most cases, the  concentrations are reported with the background values added for easy comparison to the NAAQS.  In this example, the reported values represent the highest concentrations of all the receptors  analyzed.  

It is important to note that in some instances the background values may be near or exceed the  NAAQS by themselves and the effects of the Federal Action’s contribution is minimal by  comparison . In these cases, it should be clearly documented in the results that the Federal Action  was not the cause of the predicted violation(s).  

![Table 7-2. Dispersion Modeling Results  ](images/b2fea7b6ca932ce895197594ddabdf24db85213e615f52772a59bd12a35f9a2b.jpg)  

# 7.2.   Roadway Dispersion Modeling  

This section addresses the approaches for assessing emissions from  roadway  intersections in  connection with the Transportation Conformity regulations. The EPA’s  Project-Level Conformity  and Hot-Spot Analyses 136  provides additional information on dispersion modeling methods, data  requirements, and other supporting materials.  

# 7.2.1.   Introduction & Background  

A roadway intersection analysis, also known as a “hot-spot” analysis 137  is typically performed  pursuant for a project specific analysis under  the  requirements of Transportation Conformity.  It is  important to note that FHWA/FTA would most likely be responsible for the approval of the  Transportation Conformity determination.  Including this analysis in an FAA NEPA document  would be appropriate for consideration of cumulative impacts.  This hot-spot analysis would never  be included in an FAA General Conformity evaluation since emissions covered by Transportation  Conformity are explicitly excluded from consideration in General Conformity 138 .  

The main pollutants of concern in a hot-spot analysis are CO, PM 10 , and PM 2.5 . At aviation  facilities, these emissions arise from motor vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, vans, buses, etc.) traveling  and idling along on- and off-airport roadways. For this analysis, the pollutant concentrations would  be analyzed at each applicable intersection(s), combined with a background concentration, and  then compared to the appropriate NAAQS.  

# 7.2.2.   Transportation Conformity Guidance  

CAA conformity requirements under 42 U.S.C   $\S~7506$   ensure emissions from transportation  projects conform to air quality plans within areas designated by the U.S. EPA as nonattainment or  maintenance 139  with respect to the NAAQS. The specific procedures, referred to as the  Transportation Conformity   requirements (see  Section 8 ,  Conformity),  apply to  transportation  programs, transportation plans, and FHWA/FTA projects.  The Transportation Conformity  regulations for localized CO and PM hot-spot analyses are codified within 40 CFR Part 93, Subpart  A.  It is important to note that only a small subset of FAA Federal Actions are subject to  Transportation Conformity.  

When conducting a hot-spot analysis for the purposes of complying with Transportation  Conformity, the EPA-preferred/recommended dispersion and emission models 142  are the  CAL3QHC/CAL3QHCR and AERMOD, and MOVES/EMFAC (see  Section 5 ,   Air Quality  Assessment Models ), respectively.  

# CO Project-level Analyses  

NEPA air quality analyses have typically focused on CO as the primary indicator of vehicular air  quality impacts. A CO project-level hot-spot analysis is performed to ensure that new or worsened  violations of the NAAQS will not occur as a result of a Federal Action. Presently, EPA in  coordination with FHWA and FTA, has provided the following guidance documents for  conducting CO hot-spot analyses for project-level air quality requirements under Transportation  Conformity:  

•   Guideline for Modeling Carbon Monoxide from Roadway Intersections 143  

This guidance provides the methodology for estimating the air quality impacts associated  with vehicular traffic at intersection(s) to determine if such impacts may exceed the  NAAQS for CO.  

•   Using MOVES in Project-Level Carbon Monoxide Analyses 144  

This guidance supersedes the emission factor sections from the 1992 CO Guidelines to  reflect the use of the MOVES emissions model for project-level CO analyses. In particular,  this guidance describes how to use the MOVES emissions model to estimate CO emissions  from transportation projects, including roadway intersections, highways, transit projects,  parking lots, and intermodal terminals. This guidance can be applied when using MOVES  to complete any project-level quantitative CO analysis, including hot-spot analyses for  transportation conformity determinations, modeling project-level emissions for SIP  development, and completing analyses pursuant to NEPA.  

# PM Project-level Analyses  

PM (i.e.,  $\mathrm{PM}_{10}$   and   $\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$  ) hot-spot analyses are required for projects of local air quality concern,  which include certain highway and transit projects that involve significant levels of diesel vehicle  traffic and any other project identified in the PM SIP as a localized air quality concern. Presently,  the principal  guidance  document for assessing PM hot-spot analysis issued by EPA (in  coordination with DOT) is the following:  

•   Transportation Conformity Guidance for Quantitative Hot-spot Analyses in PM 2.5  and  PM  Nonattainment and Maintenance Areas 145   10  

This guidance describes how to complete quantitative hot-spot analyses for certain  highway and transit projects in PM 10  and PM 2.5  nonattainment and maintenance areas. In  addition, this guidance describes transportation conformity requirements for hot-spot  analyses, and provides technical guidance on estimating project emissions with EPA’s  MOVES model, California’s EMFAC model, and other methods.  

# 8.   Conformity Under the Clean Air Act  

The Clean Air Act (CAA) section   $176(\mathfrak{c})^{146}$   conformity requirement integrates air quality planning  on the state level with project planning on a federal level. This serves to protect the integrity of  states’ plans for improving air quality when federal agencies propose their actions within areas of  states’ jurisdiction and authority ( i.e.,  nonattainment and maintenance areas). Under the  Clean Air  Act Amendments of 1990 , the EPA enhanced the CAA conformity requirement to put increased  emphasis on reconciling emissions from a federal action 147  with a state’s applicable  implementation plan (SIP) for pollution  prevention  and control.  This way, consideration of  emissions’ controls occurs before a federal action is implemented rather than considering control  measures afterward.  

When a federal agency proposes an action that would cause emissions to occur within a  nonattainment or maintenance area, a state must have assurance from the agency that the state’s  SIP growth projections will not be exceeded, its emissions reduction progress targets will not be  delayed, and the emissions caused by the action will not interfere with the state’s ability to attain  and maintain the National Ambient Air  Quality  Standards (NAAQS).  To that end, under the  CAA conformity requirement—  

No department, agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government shall  engage in, support in any way or provide financial assistance for, license or  permit, or approve, any activity which does not conform to an implementation  plan after it has been approved or promulgated under 42 U.S.C.   $\mathcal{S}$   7410. No  metropolitan planning organization designated under 23 U.S.C.   $\mathcal{S}$   134 shall  give its approval to any project, program, or plan which does not conform to  an implementation plan approved or promulgated under 42 U.S.C.  $\vartheta\:74I O.T h e$    assurance of conformity to such an implementation plan shall be an affirmative  responsibility of the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality.  

42 U.S.C.   $\S7506$  . In addition, the CAA conformity requirement contributes to the protection of  human health and welfare, and the environment, by ensuring federal agencies 151  engage state air  quality planners and the public before taking an action that could impede the progress of improving  air quality within a state. Conformity to the SIP means— 152  

(A)  conformity to an implementation plan's purpose of eliminating or  reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air  quality standards and achieving expeditious attainment of such  standards; and  (B)  that such activities will not—  (i)  cause or contribute to any new violation of any standard in any  area;  (ii)  increase the frequency or severity of any existing violation of any  standard in any area; or   (iii)  delay timely attainment of any standard or any required interim  emission reductions or other milestones in any area.”  

This chapter focuses on the preparation of a General Conformity evaluation. FAA is providing this  explanatory guidance to assist stakeholders in the planning, organization and finalization of  consistent conformity evaluations that will meet the legal requirements for all FAA Federal  Actions. The foundation information and procedural steps described in this chapter are designed  to help identify Federal Actions that are subject to the conformity requirement, gauge the  likelihood that an action will require a conformity determination, and learn how to navigate  through the reporting and public participation requirements. The procedures are supplemented by  helpful flowcharts that allow a “quick look” at what to do, how to do it, and when to do it. The  conformity evaluation is organized, for the purpose of this  Handbook , into four parts—  

Part I—Actions Subject to General Conformity ( Section 8.3 );  Part II—Applicability Analysis ( Section 8.4 );  

Part III—Demonstration, Draft Determination, Reporting and Public Participation ( Section  8.5 ); and  

Part IV—Final Determination, Reporting and Response to Comments. ( Section 8.6  

Introductory  Sections 8.1  and  8.2  provide basic information on the regulatory structure of  conformity, NEPA and how they work together, and explain how, when combined with state and  local air quality planning, they provide the framework that allows states to attain and maintain  the NAAQS.  

# 8.1.   Conformity Regulations and Enforcement  

Conformity applies to two distinct types of federal actions—transportation related actions and non- transportation related actions. For both types of federal actions, the CAA conformity requirement  directed the EPA to promulgate and periodically update the criteria and procedures for  demonstrating and determining how emissions caused by federal actions will conform to a SIP. Accordingly, the EPA implemented the CAA conformity requirement for transportation-related  actions under 40 CFR part 93 subpart A (the Transportation Conformity regulations), and all  remaining “general” federal actions are applicable under 40 CFR part 93 subpart B (the General  Conformity regulations).  

The primary differences between the Transportation and General Conformity regulations are the  type of emission sources the control and when a conformity determination is triggered.  

# 8.1.1.   Transportation Conformity Regulations  

The Transportation Conformity program 154  was established in   $1993^{155}$   and EPA subsequently  published several amendments. The Transportation Conformity regulations apply to   transportation improvement programs, transportation projects and transportation plans 156  as  defined in 40 CFR 93.101. The transportation conformity rules also apply to projects that meet  the definition of a regionally significant project 157  implemented by an entity receiving funding  from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) or the Federal Transit Administration  (FTA).  However, where only transportation conformity applies, emissions from  construction of transportation facilities are not considered.  

These regulations establish criteria and procedures for determining whether transportation  programs, projects and plans require a conformity determination, which is triggered by  exceeding the screening thresholds established within the SIP for the Motor Vehicle Emissions  Budget (MVEB), ,  above which a determination is required.  

The evaluation of Transportation Conformity is the responsibility of the U.S. Department of  Transportation and the local MPO that develops the regional transportation plan. The EPA  Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) is responsible for management of the  Transportation Conformity program.  

# 8.1.2.   General Conformity Regulations  

The General Conformity regulations 161  were also published in   $1993^{162}$   and existed without  revisions for many years. The EPA finalized a major revision to the regulations in 2010,  and  revised it again in 2016to add precursors for the secondary formation of PM 2.5  emissions and  to establish  de minimis  threshold   rates for the pollutant and its precursors.   The major  changes in the 2010 revisions of the rule included the elimination of the requirement for a  regional significance analysis, the requirement for states to develop and adopt their own  general conformity regulations and the new program to develop Early Emissions Reduction  Credits (EERCs).  

General Conformity focuses on a variety of emissions-producing sources including mobile and  stationary sources, area, point, volume and line sources and construction sources whether  operating on land, sea 165  or in the air.  General Conformity covers most emission sources that  would be affected by FAA Federal Actions.  

The program establishes criteria and procedures for demonstrating whether general federal  actions require a conformity determination, which is triggered by equaling or exceeding  established  de minimis  threshold rates below which a federal action is not subject to General  Conformity.  The program also fosters communications between federal agencies and  state/local air quality agencies,  provides for public notification of and access to federal  agency conformity determinations 168  and allows for air quality review of individual federal  actions.  

The evaluation of General Conformity is the responsibility of each federal agency taking an  action that is subject to conformity.  The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards  (OAQPS) is responsible for management of the General Conformity program and can provide  technical support and guidance .  

# 8.1.3.   Tribal Governments  

Tribal governments also play an important role in implementing provisions of the CAA in their  areas. If a tribe has the desire and capability to administer one or more CAA programs and  meet certain criteria, the EPA can approve the tribe as eligible to implement CAA programs.  The tribe can then develop and obtain approval of certain CAA programs from the  EPA. Otherwise, the EPA usually implements the CAA provisions in Indian country. The  EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) works closely with tribal governments and tribal  environmental professionals, and provides training, grants, and technical support to increase  their capacity to develop and manage their air quality programs.  

# 8.2.   Federal Actions  

A general federal action either directly undertaken by a federal agency or requiring assistance from  a federal agency for funding, approval or permitting may be subject to the requirement for  preparation of a general conformity determination 172  to meet the requirements of section 176(c)(1)  of the CAA.. Not all actions of federal agencies must undergo evaluation and preparation of a  general conformity determination – in some cases, the action may satisfy an agency’s “presumed  to conform” list requirements 173  or an action may be otherwise exempt.   Where these methods  of compliance with the section 176(c)(1) are not available, emissions of non-attainment or  maintenance criteria pollutants associated with a federal project may require preparation of a  general conformity determination.  

“Major federal actions” 176  under NEPA are generally associated with General Conformity. While  the statutes are closely related in their purposes of bringing environmental considerations to bear  in federal decision-making, the requirements under conformity are quite different from the  procedures of NEPA.  One does not “trigger” the other or vice versa; they are independently  applicable, with distinct purposes and applicability.  

However, due to the similarity of the definitions of the types of actions to which each statute  applies, for purposes of this  Handbook , the term “Federal Action” will  refer to actions that require  compliance with both  the conformity obligations under the CAA and the procedural requirements  of NEPA.  

# 8.2.1.Cooperating Agencies  

For various reasons, the preparation of a NEPA review may require the cooperation of multiple  federal agencies, states, tribes or local agencies. This typically occurs when an entity other than  the action agency has special expertise or jurisdiction related to environmental impacts of the  Federal Action, or where a Federal Action falls under the authority of more than one federal agency  and requires approvals from each.. These federal agencies, together with states, tribes, or local  agencies, may agree to be “cooperating agencies” for purposes of conducting the NEPA review.  

179  Usually there is one agency designated as the “lead agency” 180  to supervise preparation of the  environmental analysis on the behalf of all agencies, and the lead agency often oversees the  conformity evaluation as well.  

Throughout the NEPA process, the lead agency will collaborate, to the fullest extent possible, with  all cooperating agencies concerning those issues relating to their specific jurisdiction and special  expertise.  

In some cases, the FAA may need to provide assistance to another federal agency for that agency’s  action being reviewed under NEPA, where the other federal agency takes the lead. The FAA then,  as a cooperating agency, is responsible for its own conformity evaluation of the Federal Action  under FAA jurisdiction unless the cooperating  agencies  agree that the lead agency should prepare  the conformity evaluation to cover emissions within the jurisdiction of the FAA. In such case, the  lead agency would provide the FAA, as well as the other cooperating agencies, with the  opportunity to provide input and review the draft conformity evaluation.  

# 8.2.1.1.   Responsibilities  

Ensuring that emissions caused by a Federal Action will conform to the SIP is not the  responsibility of the state or the EPA, nor are non-federal entities ( e.g. , the airport  authority or airport sponsor) responsible for ensuring conformity. However, non- federal entities, such as an airport authority or airport sponsor, along with the MPO,  are responsible for cooperation in regional transportation planning, and have important  roles in the conformity process by providing historical data and planning information  needed to support a successful conformity evaluation.Each federal agency is solely  responsible for deciding whether its actions are subject to conformity and has the  affirmative responsibility to make its own conformity determination.  

If required to make a conformity determination, the agency has the responsibility to  meet all the requirements of the conformity provisions and ensure the action’s  emissions will conform to the SIP as required under CAA section 176(c)(1)(A) and  (1)(B). The federal agency has the responsibility to ensure any reporting and public  participation requirements are met.  

Where more than one federal agency has authority to make a decision related a project  being reviewed in a joint NEPA document, each cooperating agency that will issue a  decision at the completion of the NEPA process is responsible for its own CAA  conformity evaluation, where such an evaluation is required. The lead agency in the  NEPA review would provide each cooperating agency with the opportunity to review  

and offer input on the conformity evaluation. For proposed aviation actions, most  agencies rely on the FAA to lead the NEPA review and prepare the conformity  evaluation..  

In some cases, the FAA may need to provide assistance to another federal agency for  that agency’s action being reviewed under NEPA, where the other federal agency takes  the lead. The FAA then, as a cooperating agency, would be responsible for the  conformity evaluation of its own activities that fall under FAA jurisdiction. In the  alternative, the cooperating  agencies  may agree that the lead agency should prepare the  conformity evaluation to cover emissions within the jurisdiction of the other agencies.  In such case, the lead agency would provide the FAA, as well as the other cooperating  agencies, with the opportunity to provide input and review the draft conformity  evaluation.  

# 8.2.2.   NEPA-General Conformity Connection  

A connection exists between the CAA conformity requirements and NEPA assessments,  particularly for actions requiring environmental impact statements.  Both seek to protect  human health and the environment from actions proposed by the federal government, and they  are usually prepared concurrently because of their similar reporting and public participation  requirements.  

Federal Actions that require a NEPA assessment do not always require a conformity  evaluation. However, nearly every conformity evaluation is associated with a NEPA review.  This is because most NEPA actions involve some kind of construction or operational aspect  that would cause emissions of the criteria or precursor pollutants to occur, and if the action  would also cause such emissions to originate within a nonattainment area or maintenance area,  conformity applies and, at a minimum, an applicability analysis is required.  

While there are some similarities, the focus, purpose and intent of NEPA and General  Conformity are different. NEPA is a procedural law that ensures that Federal agencies consider  the environmental impacts of their actions and any alternatives in the decision-making  process.  The federal agency will make a decision on which alternative will ultimately be  approved for implementation. The CAA, on the other hand, and by extension conformity, is a  substantive law that focuses on the NEPA alternative ultimately approved for implementation  for the purpose of ensuring it will not interfere with states’ rights and responsibilities to control  air pollution in areas of their own jurisdiction, including attaining the NAAQS as expeditiously  as possible. Thus, NEPA does not intend to mandate particular results or substantive outcomes  as conformity does. Thus, General Conformity and NEPA, when combined with state and local  air quality planning, provide the framework within which the states can attain and maintain the  NAAQS.  

Usually, the FAA can identify the preferred alternative early in the NEPA process and  therefore, may limit the General Conformity process to that single alternative. However, it is  not uncommon for the FAA to evaluate General Conformity for all the NEPA alternatives to  

ensure there is no delay in implementation of the Federal Action if the preferred alternative is  not ultimately approved. The FAA prepares NEPA and the General Conformity evaluation in  parallel because their reporting and public participation processes run along a similar timeline.  

# 8.2.2.1.   NEPA  

NEPA’s goals of informed decision-making and public involvement result in a legal  mandate for a broader environmental evaluation than required under conformity,  including evaluation of additional environmental resources and possibly a more  expansive geographic area of study. NEPA considers the merit of several project  alternatives, whereas conformity requires compliance only for the alternative that will  be implemented. NEPA assesses the potential significant environmental effects of all  project alternatives and requires the federal agency to disclose this information in a  concise detailed statement ( i.e.,  EIS, EA or CatEx). When an agency prepares an EIS,  the agency must undertake a public review process similar to that required for General  Conformity.  

# 8.2.2.2.   General Conformity  

General Conformity   requires the federal agency to focus its attention just on the Federal  Action the agency approves, or would approve in the agency’s decision document and  applies only to actions occurring within nonattainment or maintenance areas.  

There are reporting and public review and comment requirements under General  Conformity that are nearly the same as for the NEPA EIS determinations. When  complete, documentation of the General Conformity evaluation may be appended to  the NEPA document or presented in a separate document. While NEPA has a  requirement to disclose the results of its analyses of environmental impact, but does  not dictate results, under the Clean Air Act conformity provisions, if the agency cannot  demonstrate that the project “conforms” to the SIP, the proposed action cannot go  forward.  

The remainder of this chapter presents the four parts of a General Conformity evaluation.  

Part I—Actions Subject to General Conformity ( Section 8.3 );  Part II—Applicability Analysis ( Section 8.4 );  Part III—Demonstration, Draft Determination, Reporting and Public Participation ( Section  8.5 ); and  Part IV—Final Determination, Reporting and Response to Comments ( Section 8.6 ).  

# 8.3.   Part I—Actions Subject to General Conformity  

Early in the planning process, the FAA should work with the project sponsor ( e.g. , airport  authority) and the local MPO to consider whether the Federal action will be subject to General  Conformity requirements. In examining this question, the FAA must carefully consider the scope  of its Federal Action, identify the affected nonattainment and maintenance areas and identify the  relevant criteria and precursor pollutants for those areas.  

# 8.3.1.   Defining the Scope of the Federal Action  

It is important to first have a thorough and accurate understanding of the scope of a Federal Action  in order to determine whether the action is subject to the General Conformity regulations. Because  applicability of general conformity requirements depends, in part, on whether the action takes  place in a non-attainment or maintenance area, the general conformity applicability evaluation  requires an examination of the affected environment identified in the NEPA process. The affected  environment includes all the areas affected directly or indirectly by the action, which may not be  limited to the immediate area that is the main focus of the action. The affected environment may  need to be expanded to include, among other things, travel routes for employees and on-road  construction  equipment ( e.g.,  trucks hauling soil),  staging areas for off-road construction  equipment, and new sources of emissions or modified existing sources proposed in the action. The  description of the affected environment needs to identify the county or multi-county air quality  regions affected by the action 184  and determine the air quality status of the affected   nonattainment  or maintenance areas. Typically, the geographic scope established in the NEPA process for the  “affected environment” will coincide with the geographic area where pollutant emissions caused  by the Federal action originate. The emissions relevant to the analysis include direct emissions  caused by the Federal action, and indirect emissions “(t)hat are caused or initiated by the Federal  action and originate in the same nonattainment or maintenance area but occur at a different time  or place as the action; (t)hat are reasonably foreseeable; (t)hat the agency can practically control;  and (f)or which the agency has continuing program responsibility.”  

Neither CAA section 176(c) nor the implementation regulations under General Conformity  fully defines how to determine the scope of a Federal Action. In joint guidance on airport  conformity issues, the FAA and the EPA advise that when a NEPA review is  being  prepared,  the scope of the action for the purposes of conformity should mirror the scope of the Federal  Action and at least the extent of the affected environment defined for the NEPA review—  

“ For airport development, if projects or actions are combined together for  NEPA, then generally they should be kept together for General Conformity  unless there are specific reasons to separate the projects or actions.” 186  

This guidance is supported by the EPA in its 1993 final rule 187  where, “ EPA believes that it is  reasonable to expect that a conformity determination could be developed in parallel with the  ongoing environmental analysis. ”  

The issue is made more difficult when the decision of whether activities should be combined  for the purposes of the NEPA review could affect project  schedule , complexity and litigation  

# 8.3.2.   Nonattainment Area and Maintenance Area Limitations  

Conformity applies when emissions caused by a Federal Action would originate within a  nonattainment or maintenance area.  However, certain limitations apply when determining  whether Federal Actions in these areas are subject to conformity.  

# 8.3.2.1.   Nonattainment Areas  

A Federal Action proposed for a nonattainment area is not subject to conformity until  1 year after the effective date of the nonattainment designation, as provided for under  CAA section 176(c)(6). This grace period applies to new or revised NAAQS under  CAA sections 108 and 109, and to areas redesignated from attainment to nonattainment  under CAA 107(d)(3).  

The grace-period applies to a new/revised/redesignated nonattainment area for a  particular NAAQS even though the area may be nonattainment or maintenance for  multiple other NAAQS. Be aware that there might be multiple NAAQS for one criteria  pollutant, with the same averaging times, but different levels ( i.e. , concentrations) that  are simultaneously in effect for a single nonattainment or maintenance area ( e.g. , ozone  has two 8-hour NAAQS, the 2008 standard for 0.075 ppm and the 2015 standard for  0.070 ppm; both might apply to the same nonattainment or maintenance area).  

Sometimes ozone nonattainment areas are reclassified to a more protective  classification (“bumped up” for instance from Moderate nonattainment to Serious  nonattainment) due to the poor air quality conditions in the ozone nonattainment area  that prevents the area from achieving the NAAQS by the regulatory attainment date.  For instance, the EPA reclassified 191  a number of Moderate ozone nonattainment areas  to Serious ozone nonattainment areas for the 2008 ozone 8-hour NAAQS when some  areas failed to attain the NAAQS by the attainment date established by the EPA. This  is an instance of reclassification, not redesignation. Therefore, the 1-year grace period  does not apply to these reclassified areas.  

# 8.3.2.2.   Maintenance Areas  

When a state requests the EPA to redesignate a nonattainment area to attainment  because the NAAQS has been achieved, the state must provide certain revisions to its  SIP to ensure attainment of the NAAQS throughout future years is maintained. Under  CAA section 176(c)(6), the revision includes the submittal of a “maintenance plan,”  

developed pursuant to CAA section 175A, that outlines the strategies and methods the  state will use to maintain the NAAQS throughout a specified period of time. Such areas  are referred to as “maintenance areas.” 192  

The state is required to include, among other things, terms and conditions for emissions  control measures in its CAA section 175A-approved maintenance plan, which would  be in effect for a period of 10 years beyond the effective date that EPA approved  redesignation of the area to attainment. Eight years into the maintenance plan, the state  usually submits a second 10-year plan that ensures maintenance of the NAAQS for  another 10 years beyond the first 10-year period. This creates a total maintenance  period of 20 years. When the 20 years expire, the terms and conditions of the  maintenance plan remain in full force and effect, even though General Conformity no  longer applies, until the plan is removed by a subsequent EPA-approved SIP revision.   If a SIP contains provisions to extend the 20-year expiration to a date beyond the 20  years, the applicability of conformity is extended as well.  

Some states may choose the alternative to submit to EPA a revised slimmed down  “limited maintenance plan” (LMP), which also must be approved by EPA under CAA  section 175A.  The option to develop a LMP is useful for maintenance areas that meet  certain air quality conditions that will, with a high degree of probability, maintain the  NAAQS 10 years into the future. It follows that future year emissions projections in  these areas ( i.e.,  a Motor Vehicle Emissions Budget (MVEB)), and some of the  standard analyses to determine Transportation Conformity with the SIP are no longer  necessary.  In such areas, transportation plans, programs and projects are presumed  to conform to the SIP.  

EPA’s General Conformity regulations, however, do not distinguish between  maintenance areas with an approved “full” maintenance plan and those with an  approved LMP. Thus, maintenance areas operating under an LMP are subject to the  same General Conformity requirements as those covered by a full maintenance plan.  

# 8.3.3.   Criteria and Precursor Air Pollutants  

The CAA requires the EPA to establish the NAAQS for six common air pollutants known as  the “criteria pollutants,” which are discussed in  Section 3.2  of this  Handbook . General  Conformity focuses on the criteria pollutants and their precursor pollutants, which are  discussed in  Section 2.2.2  of this  Handbook . When emissions of criteria or precursor pollutants  are caused by a Federal Action and those emissions would not occur except for the  implementation of the action, such emissions may be subject to General Conformity. Examples  would include emissions from the use of construction equipment to build infrastructure and  airfield areas; emissions from increased aircraft operations enabled by modified or new airfield  pavement and increased operations due to more efficient arrival or departure procedures. All  these activities could cause new emissions or decrease existing emissions in future years  compared to what would occur under the action’s “no-build” scenario of the same future year.  The CAA conformity requirement applies to such emissions only when the emissions—  

•   Originate within a nonattainment or maintenance area; and   $\bullet$    Are pollutants for which the area was designated or approved nonattainment or  maintenance; and includes the precursors of the criteria pollutants. These emissions  define the “relevant pollutants.”  

For example, for an action proposed to occur within a PM 2.5  nonattainment or maintenance  area, FAA would analyze emissions of PM 2.5  caused by the Federal Action and also emissions  of the precursors that could lead to the secondary formation of PM 2.5  emissions, which are,   $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$  , VOC,   $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$   and   $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$  —collectively referred to as the relevant pollutants for a PM 2.5   nonattainment or maintenance area. Along with PM 2.5 , ozone and   $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   are the “secondary  criteria pollutants,” whereas the remaining criteria pollutants are the “directly emitted”  pollutants and include, CO,  $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$  ,  $\mathrm{PM}_{10}$   and lead.  

# 8.3.4.   Actions Subject to General Conformity Flowchart—Part I  

The process to identify which general federal actions are subject to the conformity  requirements is presented as a flowchart in  Figure 8-1   ( Part I —Actions Subject to General  Conformity .  

![](images/c7d7872113104490ea47776d307ebfa7433bdbb4f508910cc77b709f3daace37.jpg)  
Figure 8-1. Part I—Actions subject to General Conformity  

# 8.4.   Part II—Applicability Analysis  

Once a federal agency decides its action is subject to General Conformity, the next step is to  prepare the applicability analysis. This will require an understanding of concepts such as  exemptions, presumptions of conformity, excluded emissions, reasonably foreseeable emissions,  the total of direct and indirect emissions and  de minimis  threshold rates. The purpose of the  applicability analysis is to determine whether the Federal Action must be supported by a  conformity determination.  

# 8.4.1.   Exemptions, Presumed to Conform Actions  

The General Conformity regulations list several exempted and presumed to conform (PTC)  activities ( i.e.,  parts or portions of an overall larger Federal Action) that the EPA determined  are not subject to conformity. Such emissions would be excluded from the applicability  analysis and would not require a conformity determination.  

# 8.4.1.1.   Exemptions  

Exempt emissions are those which the federal agency is not required to include in the  applicability analysis. Exempt actions are those the EPA accepts as conforming to the  SIP based on probable reasonable evidence in the absence of proof to the contrary.  Exempted emissions are caused by actions or parts of an action that would not result in  any net emissions increase or would result in an increase that is clearly  de minimis .   The EPA’s list of exempt actions that might apply to FAA actions includes the seven  activities listed in  Table   $\mathbf{4}\mathbf{-}\mathbf{1}^{195}$   of this  Handbook .  Other exemptions are listed in 40  CFR 93.153.  

# 8.4.1.2.   Presumed to Conform Actions  

A presumed to conform (PTC) action is presumed to meet the criteria for demonstrating  conformity to the applicable SIP.  The presumption is based on an analysis that  demonstrated how these actions, emissions or groups of actions would not cause  emissions to equal or exceed the  de minimis  threshold rates given at 40 CFR  93.153(b)(1) and (b)(2) and would not require a conformity determination.  

In addition to the list of PTC actions in the General Conformity regulations, the EPA  allows federal agencies to create their own list of PTC actions so long as the conformity  demonstration for each action or group of actions meets all the requirements of a PTC  analysis in the regulations under 40 CFR 93.153. However, the number of these actions  that can be applied to a single Federal Action may be limited.  In 2007, the FAA  published its own list in its final rule “Federal Presumed to Conform Actions under  

General Conformity.” 198  The list of FAA’s PTC actions is provided in  Table 4-2  of  this  Handbook .  

Note that even when an action would otherwise be presumed to conform or exempt, if EPA  or a third party shows that emissions caused by the Federal Action should not have been  presumed to conform and therefore would not meet the conformity requirements, the  requirement to demonstrate conformity to the SIP will apply and the agency may need to  conduct a new General Conformity evaluation.  

# 8.4.1.3.   Emissions Not Subject to General Conformity  

The following emissions are not included in determining applicability of the General  Conformity regulations and would be deducted from the project-related emissions  being considered in the applicability analysis—  

•   Transportation-related emissions associated with the MPO’s transportation  plan;  •   Emissions associated with a regionally significant transportation project that  will be constructed by an entity that receives FHWA/FTA funding;  •   Applied Airport Emissions Reduction Credits (AERCs) available through  the FAA’s VALE program; or  •   Applied emissions included in the FAA’s Early Emissions Reduction Credits  (EERCs) that could be used for the action.  

# 8.4.2.   Reasonably Foreseeable Emissions  

Emissions caused by the Federal Action must be considered reasonably foreseeable. There are  two key parameters to consider relative to reasonable foreseeability—the timing and certainty  of the emissions. Indirect emissions 199  become considerably less certain as they become  separated in time and space from the Federal Action. The FAA has generally limited the  consideration of indirect emissions at the point of 5 years following construction of a project.  Special circumstances should be considered in setting this limit, but few emission sources can  be reliably predicted well into the future. Similarly, subsequent state and local approvals could  be speculative, and this would limit the ability to effectively predict emissions following a  Federal Action. General Conformity does not require the use of “potential to emit” and the  regulations do not allow for speculative estimates because such emissions are not reasonably  foreseeable as defined under the General Conformity definition in 40 CFR 93.152.  

# 8.4.3.   Total of Direct and Indirect Emissions  

The applicability analysis is based primarily on the calculation of the total of direct and indirect  emissions and the identification of such emissions is not straight forward. The characterization  of emissions as being direct or indirect is not precisely defined in the General Conformity  regulations; however, this topic is addressed in the  General Conformity Guidance for Airports  Questions and Answers  dated September 25, 2002, and published by the EPA and the FAA.  The following are definitions of direct and indirect emissions—  

Direct Emissions - Direct emissions are those caused by or initiated by the  implementation and/or operation of an action, and that occur at the same time and  place as the action and must be reasonably foreseeable.  

Indirect Emissions - Indirect emissions are those caused by the implementation and/or  operation of an action, are reasonably foreseeable, but which occur later in time  and/or are farther removed in distance from the activity itself and occurs within the  same nonattainment or maintenance area. Under General Conformity, indirect  emissions are further limited to those emissions that the responsible Federal agency  can "practicably control and will maintain control over due to a continuing program  responsibility of the Federal agency."  

As an example, if a project includes a new runway and associated taxiways to accommodate  additional aircraft traffic, the construction emissions caused by operation of the construction  equipment would be categorized as direct emissions from the action. However, an increase in  emissions due to aircraft operations, if the FAA expects this to occur, depends on first  constructing the runway and taxiways and are also a projection that is dependent on airline  choices. These operational emissions would typically be categorized as indirect emissions.  

The direct and indirect emissions caused by the Federal Action would be projected for future  years for comparison to the future projected emissions under the No-Build scenario. Usually,  it is helpful to start with the year the action’s emissions are greatest on an annual basis for each  relevant pollutant. The projected emissions under the No-Action scenario would be subtracted  from the Federal Action emissions for the same year. It is helpful to present this data in a table  similar to  Table 6-2  in this  Handbook  for each future year and pollutant. The difference  between the two sets of data is the “total of direct and indirect emissions,” or “net emissions,”  for those future years. The net emissions are referred to in the General Conformity regulations  under 40 CFR 93.152 as the “total of direct and indirect emissions”—  

“Total of direct and indirect emissions means the sum of direct and  indirect emissions increases and decreases caused by the federal  action; i.e., the “net” emissions considering all direct and indirect  emissions. The total of direct and indirect emissions includes the  criteria pollutants and emissions of precursors of criteria pollutants.”  

This analysis will reveal the year-to-year emissions increase or decrease caused by the Federal  Action. The next step is to compare this data with the  de minimis  threshold rates applicable for  the nonattainment or maintenance area affected by the Federal Action.  

# 8.4.4.     de minimis  Threshold Rates  

The  de minimis  threshold rates represent the emission rates below which a conformity  determination is not required. The threshold rates vary by pollutant, by the severity of the  nonattainment status ( e.g. , Serious, Severe, Moderate etc.), and in some cases by geographic  location ( i.e.,  relative to the Ozone Transport Region states).  

The  de minimis  threshold rates are shown in  Table 8-1   de minimis   Threshold Rates for  Nonattainment Areas , and  Table 8-2   de minimis   Threshold Rates for Maintenance Areas .  

![Table 8-1.  de minimis  Threshold Rates for Nonattainment Areas.  ](images/afffc598b0e9bb2071a79d16475feada37e19700a5a7e42acca3340e2a3701d0.jpg)  

![Table 8-2.  de minimis  Thresholds in Maintenance Areas  ](images/6064bd7b016a993e2f9292c2ff83a7c265c09a04e2c24e6db968e087074ebfcc.jpg)  
Source: 40 CFR 93.153(b)(2).  Notes: OTR  $=$   Ozone Transport Region.  

Emissions caused by a Federal Action must be compared to the  de minimis  threshold rates  applicable to the affected nonattainment and maintenance areas to determine whether the  annual net emissions equal or exceed the rates. Emissions that equal or exceed the  de minimis   rates will require a conformity determination. Emissions that are less than  de minimis  are  exempt, as described in  Section 8.4.1  of this  Handbook  and require no additional analysis. The  agency should retain and document all calculations and information on which they based their  conclusion of conformity due to  de minimis  emissions. There are some circumstances where  the Federal Action could be redesigned to reduce the net emissions, if not to zero, at least to  the lowest possible rate. If some reductions can be realized through a redesign, recalculate the  total of direct and indirect emissions and compare them to the  de minimis  threshold rates. For  those pollutants with emissions that continue to equal or exceed the threshold rates, prepare a  demonstration of conformity upon which to base a draft conformity determination.  

# 8.4.5.   Applicability Analysis Flowchart—Part II  

The procedures required to prepare the applicability analysis for a Federal Action is presented  as a flowchart in  Figure 8-2 ( Part II   Applicability Analysis) .

Figure 8-2. Part II—Applicability Analysis  

# 8.5.   Part III–Demonstration, Draft Determination, Reporting and  Public Participation  

A conformity determination is needed when the annual net emissions of one or more relevant  pollutants equals or exceeds the  de minimis  threshold rates. During this phase of the conformity  evaluation, perform an analysis to demonstrate how the agency will ensure the annual net increases  of relevant pollutants caused by the action will be reduced to zero or otherwise meet the conformity  requirement under CAA 176(c)(1)(A) and (1)(B). The demonstration is required to show the  reduction of emissions for every year and every pollutant where the  de minimis  rates were equaled  or exceeded. Once the demonstration is complete and a draft conformity determination is prepared,  the agency must meet all the reporting and public participation requirements of 40 CFR 93.155  and 93.156 for the draft conformity determination.  

When the Federal Action requires a conformity determination under 40 CFR 93.153(b), there are  several approaches ( i.e.,  criteria) that can be applied alone or in combination, as listed at 40 CFR  93.158, to demonstrate conformity. The procedures required for making the determination are  listed at 40 CFR 93.159. It is important to remember that not all approaches may apply to a given  situation. In either case, be aware that the Federal Action cannot be taken or started before the  action is determined to conform to the SIP.  

The annual net emissions of each relevant pollutant that equals or exceeds the  de minimis  rates,  for any future year, require an independent analysis to demonstrate conformity whereby the net  emissions increase must be reduced to zero net emissions or otherwise shown to conform ( e.g. ,  through air quality modeling). If a determination is required for more than one nonattainment or  maintenance area, each area will require a separate determination.  

Key considerations in selecting the optimal approach depend on variables such as:  

•   Are the relevant pollutants directly emitted pollutants or are criteria pollutants formed by  secondary formation?   •   Are the emissions caused by this specific Federal Action accounted for in the SIP?  •   Is there a SIP budget for emissions from construction? These are not necessarily project  specific; consult with the state air agency.  •   Does the SIP contain a baseline inventory of annual emissions of the relevant pollutants  prepared when the area was first designated nonattainment or redesignated attainment ( i.e.,  maintenance area)?  •   Does the SIP contain emissions targets for milestone dates?  •   Is the SIP due to be revised due to failure to attain the NAAQS by the attainment date? If  so, will the classification change?  •   Is the state planning to or willing to revise the SIP?  •   Are emissions offsets available in the region?  •   What air quality model would be most appropriate if modeling is chosen?  •   What meteorological data is available for the project area?  

•   Can background concentrations of the pollutants be established, which are needed for  determining the design concentration values 201  that are then compared to the NAAQS to  verify conformity?  

The best approach is always project-specific and often is dependent on factors outside the control  of the FAA or the airport,  e.g. , the area’s classification may be scheduled to be “bumped up” to a  more severe classification because of the state’s failure to attain the NAAQS by the regulatory  attainment date,  which could change the  de minimis  rates that apply to a Federal Action. It  should be noted that a marginal ozone nonattainment area may have no emissions budget in the  SIP revision.  

It is always best to coordinate early with the state air quality agency, the MPO and the EPA  Regional office. There is a considerable amount of data interpretation that is required to correctly  apply the demonstration criteria. The states’ air quality agencies and MPOs are essential in  providing a full understanding of the data, the current SIP and potential developments. It is  important to note that when coordinating with the state air quality agency, conformity to the SIP  means the Federal Action’s emissions must conform to the purpose of the SIP and is not required  to comply with all the SIP’s specific methods or procedures for emissions reductions.  

# 8.5.1.Years Analyzed  

When a conformity determination is necessary to support the Federal Action, the analysis  required to demonstrate conformity must reflect emission scenarios that are expected to occur  within each of the following years— 203  

(1)  The attainment year specified in the SIP, or if the SIP does not specify an attainment  year, the latest possible attainment year allowed under the CAA; or  (2)  The last year for which emissions are projected in the maintenance plan; and  (3)  The year during which the total of direct and indirect emissions from the action is  expected to be the greatest on an annual basis; and  (4)  Any year for which the applicable SIP specifies an emissions budget as that term is  defined in the General Conformity regulations.  

Any one of these scenarios may be associated with multiple calendar years ( e.g. , if a SIP  specifies an emission budget in 3 different years) or multiple scenarios may occur in a single  calendar year ( e.g. , if a SIP’s specified budget year is also the year of maximum net emissions).  For these reasons, there is no specific number of years that need to be analyzed for a given  Federal Action. Further, in determining the year of greatest net emissions increase for a  relevant pollutant, the net emissions from multiple years may have to be calculated in order to  determine which year has the greatest annual emissions increase for each relevant pollutant.  

# 8.5.2.   Prepare the Draft Conformity Demonstration  

Prepare an analytical demonstration of how the annual net increases of each relevant pollutant  would be reduced to zero, describing all criteria and procedures that are used and providing  copies of any written agreements or commitments for mitigation or offsets. It would be difficult  to include in this guidance exactly how the demonstration should be prepared since all Federal  Actions are unique. However, all such demonstrations should be documented with details of   all strategies and methods used to reduce the emissions. Prepare a report that outlines the  procedures and contains tables to organize the data.  

If the agency chooses to perform air quality modeling to demonstrate conformity, the agency  must be consistent with the techniques recommended in the latest version of Appendix W of  40 CFR part 51 ( i.e.,   Guideline   on Air Quality Models ), and must document all input data,  assumptions and solutions.  

In the documentation for the conformity demonstration, the agency would identify which  criteria under 40 CFR 93.158 the agency is claiming to demonstrate conformity, and ensure  the procedures used are consistent with 40 CFR 93.159 through 93.165, as appropriate. The  agency would retain all records documenting the preparation of the demonstration, including  calculations and information sufficient that the quantification can be verified by a third party.  

# 8.5.3.   Prepare the Draft Conformity Determination  

Based on the applicability analysis and the conformity demonstration, prepare the written draft  conformity determination. Ensure the determination states clearly how the action’s emissions  meet the conformity requirements under CAA section 176(c)(1)(A) and (1)(B) and attach all  documentation.  

# 8.5.4.Reporting Requirements for the Draft Conformity Determination  

The agency must meet all the reporting requirements under 40 CFR 93.155 for the draft  conformity determination. The agency must provide a 30-day notice that describes the Federal  Action and the agency’s draft determination, as required under 40 CFR 93.155(a). Distribute  the notice to all relevant federal, state and local air quality agencies, and where applicable,  notify the affected federally recognized Indian tribal government and affected Federal Land  Manager. In addition, notify the offices listed in CAA section 174, if applicable, and the  MPO.  

# 8.5.5.   Public Participation Requirements for the Draft Conformity  Determination  

The agency must meet all the public participation requirements under 40 CFR 93.156 for the  draft conformity determination.  

Under 40 CFR 93.156(a), upon request by any person, make available for review the draft  determination, including supporting documentation that describes the analytical methods and  conclusions relied upon in making the applicability analysis and draft determination.  

Under 40 CFR 93.156(b), the agency must make public its draft conformity determination and  provide a 30-day period for public review and to receive their written comments. The agency  must retain the comments for documentation and prepare written responses to the comments.  This comment period may occur concurrently with other public involvement, such as it may  occur in the NEPA process. The public participation requirements must be met before any  formal action is taken on the draft determination.  

In addition, under 40 CFR 93.156(b), the agency must place a notice by prominent  advertisement in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the action. If  the action would have multi-regional or national impacts, the agency could, as an alternative,  publish the notice in the Federal Register.  

Under 40 CFR 93.156(a), the agency must, upon request by any person, make available the  comments and its responses to the comments.  

# 8.5.6.   Demonstration, Draft Determination, Reporting and Public  Participation Flowchart—Part III  

The process for demonstrating and preparing the draft conformity determination, and meeting  the reporting and public participation requirements, are presented as a flowchart in  Figure 8- 3  ( Part III—Demonstration, draft determination, reporting and public participation) .

# 8.6.   Part IV—Final Determination, Reporting and Response to  Comments  

During this final phase of the conformity evaluation, the agency would prepare the final conformity  determination, ensuring all comments received on the draft determination have written responses  and meet the reporting requirements as given in 40 CFR 93.155 for the final determination .  

# 8.6.1.   Prepare the Final Conformity Determination  

The agency would prepare the final conformity determination based upon the draft  determination and after considering comments from any interested parties, as directed under  40 CFR 93.154. Ensure the determination states clearly how the action’s emissions meet the  conformity requirements under CAA section 176(c)(1)(A) and (1)(B).  

# 8.6.2.   Reporting Requirements for the Final Conformity Determination  

The agency must meet all the reporting requirements under 40 CFR 93.155(b) for the final  conformity determination. Within 30 days after making the final conformity determination the  agency must notify all relevant federal, state and local air quality agencies, and where  applicable, notify the affected federally recognized Indian tribal government and affected  Federal Land Manager, and the MPO .  

# 8.6.3.   Public Participation Response to Comments for the Final  Conformity Determination  

The federal agency must meet all the public participation requirements under 40 CFR 93.156  for the final conformity determination. Under 40 CFR 93.156(c), the agency must document  its responses to all the comments received on its draft conformity determination and make the  material available upon request by any person within 30 days of the final conformity  determination.  

Under 40 CFR 93.156(d), the agency must, within 30 days of the final determination, make  public its final determination by placing a notice by prominent advertisement in a daily  newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the action. If the action would have  multi-regional or national impacts, the agency, as an alternative, can publish the notice in the  Federal Register.

The process for preparing the final conformity determination and meeting the reporting and  public participation requirements are presented as a flowchart in  Figure 8-4 ( Part IV— Final  determination, reporting and response to comments).  

# 8.7. Confidential Business Information Exclusions  

Under 40 CFR 93.155(c) and 93.156(e), the draft and final conformity determinations shall  exclude any restricted information or confidential business information. The disclosure of  restricted information and confidential business information shall be controlled by the applicable  laws, regulations, security manuals, or executive orders concerning the use, access, and release of  such materials. Subject to applicable procedures to protect restricted information from public  disclosure, any information or materials excluded from the draft or final conformity determination  or supporting materials may be made available in a restricted information annex to the  determination for review by Federal and State representatives who have received appropriate  clearances to review the information.

# 9.   Coordination Best Practices  

This section discusses the opportunities, objectives, and methods of conducting agency  coordination in support of the air quality assessment process. Such coordination between the FAA,  the reviewing agencies, and other stakeholders will help foster a common understanding for how  to meet the goals of the assessment and will help to avoid unnecessary delays and setbacks. For  the purposes of this discussion, three common methods for conducting this coordination are  addressed: (i)  the  Scoping Process, (ii) the Air Quality Assessment Protocol, and (iii) the  Coordination and Review Process.  

# 9.1.   Scoping Process  

Under NEPA, “scoping” is an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be  addressed in a NEPA document and for identifying the significant issues related to a Federal  Action. Typically, the responsible FAA  official  (as defined in FAA Order 1050.1) takes the lead  in the scoping process, inviting the participation of affected federal, state, local, and tribal agencies  and any other interested persons. Although there is no standard approach to scoping, it is also  common that scoping facilitates public participation in the process. If appropriate, a scoping  meeting(s) is/are held to collect feedback from agencies and the public. Consultation with  appropriate agencies having jurisdiction by regulation or special expertise is usually initiated prior  to or upon initiation of the scoping process as well.  

In the case of  air  quality, scoping provides an opportunity for reviewing agencies and the public  to submit comments and provide suggestions on the overall scope of the assessment, including the  analysis methods, the communication of the results, and any other particular concerns or  expectations among the respondents.  

# 9.2.   Air Quality Assessment Protocol  

Another useful means of enhancing agency coordination is the development and application of an  “Air Quality  Assessment  Protocol.” The overall purpose of the protocol is to document the scope,  establish the endpoints, and resolve any areas of uncertainty regarding the assessment prior to its  undertaking. An example of the contents of such a protocol follows:  

•   Project Description  – This section provides a general overview of the purpose and scope  of the Federal Action, including the alternatives.  •   Regulatory Setting  – This section provides information pertaining to regulatory conditions  in the project area. For example, information on attainment/nonattainment designations,  SIPs, and applicable regulatory criteria and/or thresholds that will be applied to the results  of the air quality assessment can be included.  •   Air Quality Assessment  – This section describes the overall approach, specific  methodologies and models, data sources and assumptions, and other supporting  information that will be used in conducting the air quality assessment.  •   Presentation of Results  – This section describes how the results of the assessment will be  presented including the endpoints of the technical analyses.  

•   Supplemental Information  – This material includes (but is not necessarily limited to)  information pertaining to General and Transportation Conformity, HAPs and GHGs, and  any other technical information to be collected and/or developed in support of the air  quality assessment.  

Once the protocol document has been reviewed and agreed upon by the various stakeholders, the  FAA should obtain acknowledgements from the agencies consulted that the air quality protocol is  acceptable to them,  and the work completed.  

# 9.3.   Coordination and Review Process  

Agency coordination and review is the final step in addressing any comments or concerns prior to  documenting  the results and moving forward with the Federal Action.  The public comment and  review aspects of general conformity (40 CFR 93.156) can be concurrently completed with  public  involvement associated with the NEPA process, provided the requirements of both are fully  satisfied.  

FAA is singularly responsible for the air quality reviews of the Federal Action. FAA may rely on  technical analysis prepared by applicants, and applicants are encouraged to work with air quality  agencies to ensure their plans are reflected in the SIP.  However, the actual agency coordination  for a Federal Action is an FAA responsibility.

# Glossary  

This section discusses basic terms and definitions used in assessing the air quality impacts from  FAA actions.  

Above Ground Level (AGL) -  Height above ground elevation.  

Affected Environment -  The section of an environmental document  that  succinctly describes the  environmental conditions of the potentially affected geographic area or areas.  

Air Quality  -  Ambient pollutant concentrations and their temporal and spatial distribution.  

Air Quality Database  -  A collection of information on the ambient air quality that existed within  an area during a particular time period. This data is usually collected and published by the State  Air Pollution Control Agency.  

Air Quality Model  -  An algorithmic relationship between pollutant emissions and pollutant  concentrations used in the prediction of a project's pollutant impact.  

Air Qu a lity Monitor  -  A device for measuring pollutant concentrations. One such device is a  Non-Dispersed Infrared Analyzer used to record carbon monoxide concentrations.  

Air Quality Standard  -  A legal requirement for air quality, usually expressed in terms of  maximum allowable pollutant concentration, averaged over a specified interval.  

Ambient Concentrations -  Initial concentration sensed/measured at a monitoring/ sampling site.  

Ambient Monitoring -  Systematic measurements of characteristics (e.g., pollutant concentration  and wind velocity) of the air at a fixed location.  

Area Source  -  In air quality modeling the  agglomeration of many sources that have low emission  rates spread over a large area that are too numerous to treat individually. An example of this type  of source would be a parking lot.  

Atmospheric Stability -  The resistance to or enhancement of vertical air movement related to  vertical temperature profile.  

Attainment Area  -  An area that meets NAAQS for a particular pollutant.  

Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) -  On ‐ board engines that supply power to an aircraft while taxing  and parked at the gate when the main engines are off.  

Averaging Time  -  A period over which measurements of air quality parameters are taken. Air  quality standards are specified for averaging times of one, three, eight, and twenty four hours, as  well as one year.  

Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT)  -  A software system that dynamically models  aircraft performance in space and time to produce fuel burn, emissions, and noise.  

Background Concentration  -  Pollutant concentrations due to (i) natural sources, (ii) nearby  sources other than the one(s) currently under consideration and (iii) unidentified sources.  

Calm -  For purpose of air quality modeling, calm is used to define the situation when the wind is  indeterminate with regard to speed or direction.  

Carbon Dioxide   $(\mathbf{CO}_{2})$   -  The most prevalent GHG emitted when burning carbon ‐ based fuels.  

Carbon Monoxide (CO)  -  A colorless, odorless, toxic gas produced by the incomplete combustion  of organic materials used as fuels. CO is emitted as a byproduct of essentially all combustion.  Idling and low speed mobile source operations, such as aircraft taxiing are the most prevalent CO  emission sources commonly found at airports.  

Categorical  Exclusion  ( CA TEX) -  Categories of actions that do not individually or cumulatively  have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such  effect. See 40 C.F.R. Section 1508.4. Note: A categorically excluded action is NOT eligible to be  categorically excluded if extraordinary circumstances exist that may cause a significant  environmental effect. Extraordinary circumstances are f actors or circumstances that raise the  potential for a proposed action included in a CATEX to have a significant environmental impact  and therefore require further analysis in an EA or an EIS (see Paragraph 5-2 of FAA Order 1050.1F  and CEQ 40 CFR 1508.4).  

Clean Air Act (CAA) -  The Federal law regulating air quality. The first CAA, passed in 1967,  required that air quality criteria necessary to protect the public health and welfare be developed.  Since 1967, there have been several revisions to the CAA. The CAA Amendments (CAAA) of  1990 represent the fifth major effort to address clean air legislation.  

Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) -  The CAAA of 1990 represent the fifth major  effort to address clean air legislation. Revisions include significant strengthening of CAA,  especially by adding detailed requirements for federal actions to conform to State Implementation  Plans (SIP), expanding the list of hazardous air pollutants from eight to 189, and strengthening the  operating permit program.  

Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) -  An annual codification of the general and permanent rules  published in the Federal Register (FR) by the executive departments and agencies of the federal  government of the U.S.  

Conformity -  The act of meeting Section 176(c)(l) of the CAAA that requires federal actions to  conform to the SIP for air quality. The action may not increase the severity of an existing violation  nor can it delay attainment of any standards.  

Conformity Requirement   -  CAA section 176(c) that ensures that federal actions conform to the  purpose of the applicable implementation plan for the control and prevention of air pollution within  nonattainment areas and maintenance areas. In order to meet this CAA requirement, Federal  agencies must demonstrate that the actions they approve, permit or fund will not cause a new  violation of an air quality standard, increase the frequency or severity of any existing violations of  any air quality standard, or delay timely attainment of any air quality standard.  

Construction Emissions   -  Emissions generated by construction activities and/or equipment that  may have substantial temporary impact on local air quality.  

Control -  The ability to regulate, in some way, the emissions from a federal action. The ability to  regulate can be demonstrated directly through the use of emissions control equipment on a boiler  or indirectly through the implementation of regulation or conditions in the nature of activity that  must be established in permits of approvals or by design of the action. An example of indirect  control is limiting vehicle emissions by controlling the size of a parking facility.  

Control Strategy -  A combination of limiting measures designed to achieve the aggregate  reduction of emissions.  

Cooperating Agency   -  A cooperating agency may be any Federal agency that has jurisdiction by  law or special expertise with respect to any potential environment impact involved in a proposal  for legislation or federal action that significantly affects the quality of the human environment. A  cooperating agency may also be a state or local agency of similar qualifications or, when the effects  influence a reservation, an Indian Tribe. By agreement with the lead agency, an Indian Tribe may  become a cooperating agency.  

Criteria Pollutants   -  The six pollutants listed in the CAA that are regulated by the EPA through  the NAAQS because of their health and/or environmental effects. They are: nitrogen dioxide   $(\mathrm{NO}_{2})$  , sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O 3 ), particulate matter (PM) which is  segregated into two size ranges: equal to or less than 10 microns in diameter (PM 10 ) and equal to  or less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM 2.5 ), and lead (Pb).  

de minimis  -  If an action has  de minimis  emissions (Conformity Rule 40 CFR 93.153c), then a  conformity determination pursuant to the CAA of 1990 is not required.  

Design Concentration Value –  The design concentration value is compared to the NAAQS to  confirm conformity to the SIP. The value is the combination of the background concentration with  the estimated modeled impact of the proposed action at modeling receptor locations. Appendix W  of 40 CFR part 51, section 9.2.2(a)(i).  

Direct Effect   -  An effect that is caused by the implementation and/or operation of an action that  occurs at the same time and place. These type of effects are also often referred to as primary effects.  

Direct Emissions   -  Direct emissions are those caused by or initiated by the implementation and/or  operation of an action, and that occur at the same time and place as the action and must be  reasonably forseeable.  

Dispersion -  The process by which atmospheric pollutants disseminate due to wind and vertical  stability.  

Emission Factor -  The rate at which pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere by one source or  a combination of sources.  

Emissions Inventory -  A complete list of sources and rates of pollutant emissions within a specific  area and time interval.  

Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System (EDMS) -  A model designed to assess the air  quality impacts of airport emission sources, particularly aviation sources, which consist of: aircraft,  APUs, GSE, ground access vehicles, and stationary sources.  

Environmental Assessment (EA) -  A concise public document that provides sufficient data,  evidence, and analysis to determine if Federal agency should prepare an EIS for an action or issue  a FONSI (see Chapter 3 of FAA Order 1050.1F). An EA is not necessary in cases where the Federal  agency has decided to prepare an EIS. An EA can be prepared at any time to aid agency decision  making.  

Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)   -  An EIS is a detailed, concise public document required  for major federal actions likely to have significant effects on the human environment. The  document may be directly prepared, without first doing an EA, if the action will have significant  environmental impacts. An EIS provides the public and decision makers with clear, written  documentation of potential significant environmental effects of the proposed action, and  reasonable alternatives including the no action alternative.  

Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)   -  A FONSI is a document which briefly presents  evidence of why Federal agency has determined that a proposed action, not otherwise categorically  excluded, will not have a significant impact on the environment (see paragraph 6-3 of FAA Order  1050.1F). The FONSI justifies why the preparation of an EIS is unnecessary. The FONSI must  include the EA or be attached to the EA, or a summary of it, and reference any other associated  environmental documents. The FONSI should state all mitigation that will be undertaken, if any.  

Fluorinated Gases   -  There are three main categories of fluorinated gases -hydro fluorocarbons  (HFCs), per fluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride   $(\mathrm{SF_{6}})$  . These are synthetic, powerful  greenhouse gases (GHGs) that have no natural sources and only come from human-related  activities and are emitted through a variety of industrial processes.  

Fugitive Dust   -  Dust discharged to the atmosphere in an unconfined flow stream such as that from  unpaved road, storage piles and heavy construction operations.  

General Aviation (GA)  - The operation of civilian aircraft for purposes other than commercial  passenger transport, including personal, business, and instructional flying.  

General Conformity Regulations -  Rule that ensures that federal actions comply with the  NAAQS. In order to meet this CAA requirement, a Federal agency must demonstrate that every  action that it undertakes, approves, permits or funds will conform to the appropriate SIP.  

Greenhouse Effect  - Trapping and build-up of heat in the atmosphere (troposphere) near the  earth’s surface. Some of the heat flowing back toward space from the earth's surface is absorbed  by water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, and several other gases in the atmosphere and then  reradiated back toward the earth’s surface. If the atmospheric concentrations of these greenhouse  gases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase.  

Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)   -  Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. The most prevalent GHGs  are CO 2 , methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide   $(\mathrm{N}2\mathrm{O})$  , and fluorinated gases.  

Ground Access Vehicle -  Encompass motor vehicles traveling on- and off-airport roadways,  within airport parking facilities, and idling along terminal curbsides (e.g., private autos,  taxis/limos, shuttles, vans, buses, rental cars, etc.). Ground access vehicles exclude those GSE used  for servicing the aircraft and airport.  

Ground Power Unit (GPU)   -  Provides electrical power to aircraft during ground time.  

Ground Support Equipment (GSE) -  On ‐ site airport vehicles and equipment designed to service  aircraft while parked at the gate or when operating in the terminal area (e.g., baggage tugs, belt  loaders, etc.).  

Hazardous Air Pollutants   (HAPs) -  Under the federal CAA and its amendments, the EPA has  initially identified 188 air pollutants that meet the definition and are regulated under Section 112  ( Toxic Air Pollutants ) of the act. These include a wide variety of organic and inorganic chemicals  and compounds.  

Heavy Metals  - Metallic elements of relatively high density, or of high relative atomic weights;  (e.g. mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, and lead).  

Hot-Spot Analysis  - an estimation of likely future localized CO, PM 10 , and/or PM 2.5  pollutant  concentrations and a comparison of those concentrations to the NAAQS.  

Hydrocarbons (HC)   -  Total hydrocarbons excluding   $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$   and ethane. These gases represent  unburned and wasted fuel. They come from incomplete combustion of gasoline and from  evaporation of petroleum fuels.  

Indirect Control   -  Control of air quality by altering activities that influence the rate and  distribution of emissions (e.g., traffic patterns, land use). Indirect control contrasts with direct  control at the source of emissions (e.g., devices on automobiles or smoke stacks).  

Indirect Effect  - Effects that are caused by the implementation and/or operation of an action, that  occur later in time or are further removed by distance from the action, but which are still reasonable  foreseeable. Often referred to as secondary effects.  

Indirect Emissions   -  Indirect emissions are those caused by the implementation and/or operation  of an action, are reasonably foreseeable, but which originate in the same nonattainment or  maintenance area but occur at a different time or place as the action. Under General Conformity,  indirect emissions are further limited to those indirect emissions that the responsible Federal  agency can "practicably control and will maintain control over due to a continuing program  responsibility of the Federal agency."  

Indirect Source   -  Any structure or installation which attracts an activity which creates emission  of pollutants. For example, a shopping center, an airport or a stadium.  

Integrated Noise Model (INM) -  A computer model that evaluates aircraft noise impacts in the  vicinity of airports.  

Inventory   -  See "Emissions Inventory.”  

Inversion   -  A thermal gradient created by warm air situated above cooler air. An inversion  suppresses turbulent mixing and thus limits the upward dispersion of polluted air.  

Landing and Takeoff (LTO)   -  LTO refers to an aircraft's landing and takeoff cycle. One aircraft  LTO is equivalent to two aircraft operations (one landing and one takeoff). The standard L TO  cycle begins when the aircraft crosses into the mixing zone as it approaches the airport on its  descent from cruising altitude, lands and taxis to the gate. The cycle continues as the aircraft taxis  back out to the runway for takeoff and climbout as its heads out of the mixing zone and back up  to cruising altitude. The five specific operating modes in a standard LTO are: approach, taxi/idle- in, taxi/idle-out, takeoff, and climbout. Most aircraft go through this sequence during a complete  standard operating cycle.  

Lead (Pb)   -  A heavy metal that, when ingested or inhaled, affects the blood forming organs,  kidneys and the nervous system. The chief source of this pollutant at airports is the combustion of  leaded aviation gasoline in piston-engine aircraft.  

Lead Agency -  The agency preparing or having taken primary responsibility for preparing the EIS.  

Level-of-Service (LOS)  - LOS   ratings measure the operating conditions at the intersection and  how these conditions affect traffic volume, signal timing, and related congestion delays.   There are  six LOS rankings: LOS A through LOS F. LOS A is the highest ranking relating to delays of less  than 10 seconds per vehicle. LOS F is the lowest, describing operations with delays greater than  80 seconds per vehicle.  

Line Source   -  In air quality modeling a  long, narrow source of emissions such as roadway or  runway.  

Maintenance Area  - Any geographic area of the U.S. previously designated nonattainment  pursuant the CAA Amendments of 1990 and subsequently redesignated to attainment.  

Major Federal Action   -  Actions with effects that may be major and potentially subject to Federal  control and responsibility. Federal actions tend to fall into four categories: adoption of official  policy, adoption of formal plans, adoption of programs and approval of projects, whether approved  by permit or other regulatory decision. See 40 CFR 1508.16 for additional information.  

Methane   $\textstyle\left(\mathbf{CH}_{4}\right)$   -  Methane is the second most prevalent GHG, emitted from industry, agriculture,  and waste management activities.  

Microscale  - Small scale analysis involving distances up to approximately one kilometer and  averaging times up to several tens of minutes.  

Mitigation -  This  t e rm  is  d e fin e d in 40  CFR 1508.20.  It includ es:  ( i)  avo idin g  th e  impa c t  a ltogeth e r  by n o t t a kin g  a  c ertain  action  or  parts of an action  or  finding a  new  s ite ; (ii)  minimizin g  impacts  by  limitin g the degree  or  magnitud e  of the  actio n  and  its  i mplement a ti on; (iii)  r ec tif y ing  the imp ac t  by rep a iring,  r e h abi litating ,  or  resto ring the  affect e d environment;  ( iv) reducing or  e limin at ing th e  impact  ov e r tim e by  preservation and  mainten a n ce  operations during the  life  of the  action;  and  (v)  compensating for  the  impact by  replacin g  or providing substitute  re so urces  or  environment s.  

Mixing Height  - The height of the completely mixed portion of atmosphere that begins at the  earth's surface and extends to a few thousand feet overhead where the atmosphere becomes fairly  stable. See also "inversion''.  

Mobile Source   -  A moving vehicle that emits pollutants. Such sources include airplanes,  automobiles, trucks, and ground support equipment.  

Mobile Source Air Toxics (MSATs) -  Mobile source air toxics are compounds emitted from  highway vehicles and nonroad equipment which are known or suspected to cause cancer or other  serious health and environmental effects. Mobile sources are responsible for direct emissions of  air toxics and contribute to precursor emissions which react to form secondary pollutants.  Examples of mobile source air toxics include benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,  acrolein, polycyclic organic matter (POM), naphthalene, and diesel PM.  

Modal Emissions Factors   -  Vehicular emissions factors for individual modes of operation. For  aircraft, these modes are takeoff, climbout, approach, and taxi.  

Model -  A quantitative or mathematical representation or simulation which attempts to describe  the characteristics or relationships of physical events.  

Monitoring Site   -  A location of a measurement device in a monitoring network.  

NAAQS Assessment   -  For the purpose of this  Handbook , this refers to the use of an air quality  model to predict ambient concentrations of air pollutants and the comparison of these results to  the NAAQS.  

National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)   -  Air Quality standards established by the  EPA to protect human health (primary standards) and to protect property and aesthetics (secondary  standards).  

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) -  An Act established “…to declare a national policy  which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to  promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and  stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and  natural resources important to the Nation; and to establish a Council on Environmental Quality.”  [42 USC   $\S$   4321 -  Congressional declaration of purpose ] NEPA requires federal agencies to  analyze the impacts of major federal actions on the human environment both to aid in decision- making and to disclose those impacts to the public.  

Nitric oxide (NO)   -  Also known as nitrogen monoxide, is a by-product of combustion of  substances in the air, as in automobile engines, fossil fuel power plants, and is produced naturally  during the electrical discharges of lightning in thunderstorms.  

Nitrogen Dioxide   $(\mathbf{NO}_{2})$   - The two most prevalent oxides of nitrogen   $(\mathrm{NO_{x})}$   are nitrogen dioxide   $(\mathrm{NO}_{2})$   and nitric oxide (NO). Both are toxic gases with NO 2  being a highly reactive oxidant and  corrosive.  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   is an odorless gas that acts mainly as an irritant affecting the mucosa of the eyes,  nose, throat, and respiratory tract. Extremely high-dose exposure (as in a building fire) to  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   may  result in pulmonary edema and diffuse lung injury.  

Nitrogen Oxides   $(\mathbf{NO_{x}})\textrm{-A}$   poisonous and highly reactive gas produced when fuel is burned at  high temperatures causing some of the abundant nitrogen in the air to bum also. At airports this  pollutant is emitted by automobiles, aircraft engines, electric power plants, and other combustion  equipment. Takeoff and climbout are the significant  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$   producing modes of aircraft operation.  

Noise Integrated Routing System (NIRS) -  A noise-assessment program designed to provide an  analysis of air traffic changes over broad areas. It is intended to work in conjunction with other  Air Traffic modeling systems that provide the source of routes, events, and Air Traffic procedures  such as altitude restrictions.  

Nonattainment Area  - Any geographic area of the U.S. that is in violation of any NAAQS and  therefore has been designated as nonattainment under the CAA.  

Non-methane OG (NMOG)  - As implied, NMOGs include all organic compounds except CH 4 which is the most common OG and a greenhouse gas that is sometimes excluded from the  assessment/analysis of organic compounds.  

NONROAD Model -  Model that estimates air pollutants from non-road engines, equipment, and  vehicles.  

Notice of Intent (NOI)   -  A brief notice placed in the  Federal Register  by the Federal agency  noting that the agency will prepare an EIS. The NOI describes the proposed action and possible  alternatives, details the proposed scoping process (i.e., location and time of meetings), and  provides the name and address of a point of contact within the Federal agency to answer questions  about the proposed action and the EIS.  

Ozone   $(\mathbf{O}_{3})\cdot\mathrm{A}$   colorless, toxic gas formed by the photochemical reactions in the atmosphere of  VOCs with the oxides of nitrogen. Ozone commonly is referred as "Smog.” Ozone is not emitted  directly by any airport.  

Particulate Matter (PM) -  Also known as “particle pollution,” is made up of a mixture of solid  particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are  large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected  using an electron microscope. Particle pollution includes "inhalable particles," with diameters  larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers (PM 10 ) and "fine particles," with  diameters that are 2.5 micrometers and smaller (i.e., PM 2.5 ).  

Plume  - The spreading pollutants emitted by a fixed source such as a smokestack or an exhaust  and released into the atmosphere.  

$\bf P M_{10}-a$   criteria pollutant for which there are NAAQS and represents the category of particulates  categorized as “coarse” PM (i.e., with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less). PM 10   includes solid and liquid material suspended in the atmosphere formed as a result of incomplete  combustion.  

PM 2.5   -  a criteria pollutant for which there are NAAQS and represents the category of particulates  categorized as “fine” PM (i.e., with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microns or less). These  particles are considered a health risk because of their ability to penetrate deep into the human  respiratory system. Aircraft are the primary source of PM 2.5  emissions at airport.  

Point Source   -  In air quality modeling a pollutant source that is fixed to the ground and that  releases pollutants through a relatively small area. Common stationary sources at airport include  boilers, heaters, incinerators, and fuel storage tanks.  

ppb   -  Parts per billion   $(10^{9})$   by volume  

ppm   -  Parts per million   $(10^{6})$   by volume.  

Positive Conformity Determination  – A determination that demonstrates the Federal Action  conforms to the SIP and the Federal Action can move forward. Otherwise, the federal agency  cannot move forward with implementation of the Federal Action.  

Precursor   -  A chemical compound that leads to the formation of a pollutant. HC and   $\mathrm{NO}_{\mathrm{x}}$  , are  precursors of photochemical oxidants.  

Preferred Model   -  A refined model that is recommended for a specific type of regulatory  application.  

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Area   -  A geographic area that contains air which  is relatively clean and not in violation of NAAQS. The emissions in these area are regulated to  prevent degradation of its air quality.  

Primary Pollutant -  Chemical contaminants which are released directly to the atmosphere by a  source.  

Primary Standard   -  A NAAQS set to protect human health.  

Receptor   -  A location at which ambient air quality is measured or estimated.  

Record of Decision (ROD)   -  The decision document, prepared after the EIS, that states what the  decision is, identifies all alternative considered by the lead agency in reaching its decision, and  states whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm have been adopted,  and if not, why not.  

Scoping -  An early and open process (that invites the participation of affected Federal, state and  local agencies, any affected Indian tribe, the proponent of the action and other interested persons)  that determines the issues to be addressed in an environmental document and identifies relevant  and/or significant issues related to a proposed action.  

Screening Technique -  A relatively simple analysis technique to determine if a given source is  likely to pose a threat to air quality. Concentration estimates from screening techniques are  conservative.  

Secondary Pollutant -  Atmospheric contaminants formed in the atmosphere as a result of such  chemical reactions as hydrolysis, oxidation, and photochemistry.  

Secondary Standard -  A NAAQS set to protect human welfare.  

Semi-volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs)  - an organic compound which has a boiling point  higher than water and which may vaporize when exposed to temperatures above room temperature.  Semi-volatile organic compounds include phenols and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).  

Simple Terrain -  An area where terrain features are all lower in elevation than the top of the stack  of the source.  

Simulation Model -  A mathematical description of a real physical and/or chemical process. The  responses of the model to input parameter variations are analogous to those of the real processes.  

Smog -  A common term for ground-level ozone.  

Stability -  A property of the atmosphere which determines the amount of vertical mixing.  

State Implementation Plan (SIP)   -  The strategy to be used by a state to control air pollution in  order that the NAAQS will be met. EPA regulations require that each state devise such a plan or  the EPA will impose its own plan for that state.  

Stationary Source   -  A source of pollutants which is immobile. Such sources include power plants,  individual heater, incinerators, fuel tanks, Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) training,  facilities, and solvent degreasers, among others.  

Sulfur Dioxide   $(\mathbf{SO}_{2})$    -  This is a corrosive and poisonous gas produced mainly from the burning  of sulfur containing fuel.  

Thrust   -  A measure of the power generated by turbine engines. Thrust is measured in pounds  (force) or kiloNewtons (kN).   $1\mathbf{k}\mathbf{N}=4\small450\;\mathbf{lb}$  .  

Total Organic Gas (TOG)   -  Defined by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) as  compounds of carbon, excluding CO,   $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  , carbonic acid, metallic carbides or carbonates, and  ammonium carbonate. TOG includes all organic gas compounds emitted to the atmosphere,  including the low reactivity compounds (e.g., methane, ethane, various chlorinated fluorocarbons,  acetone, per chl oro ethylene, volatile methyl siloxanes, and oxygenated OG).  

Transportation Implementation Plan  - A plan that analyzes the current transportation system,  near-term transportation projects and provides an option of probable costs to implement solutions.  

Turbulence  - Unsteady and irregular motions of air in the atmosphere.  

Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)  - The sum of distances traveled by all motor vehicles in a  specified region. VMT is equal to the total number of vehicle trips multiplied by the trip distance  (measured in miles). This sum is used in computing an emissions inventory for motor vehicles.  

Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)  - VOCs are created when fuels or organic waste materials  are burned. Most HCs are presumed to be VOCs in the regulatory context, unless otherwise  specified by the EPA.
