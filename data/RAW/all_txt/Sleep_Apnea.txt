# Treating OSA  

Once recognized and identified, OSA is   highly treatable, either with surgery or  nonsurgical approaches.  

Obviously, non-surgical methods should   be tried first –  

# Behavioral changes  

• Change sleeping position (sleep on side or stomach). • Change sleeping environment (mattress, light level, temperature, etc.). • A  $10\%$   weight loss will decrease the OSA Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)  by  $25\%$  .Man Sleeping

# Dental appliances  

Dentists specialized in sleep medicine  (American Academy of Dental Sleep  Medicine) are trained the use of oral appliance  therapy for the treatment of obstructive sleep  apnea and snoring.  

• Oral appliances (OA) using mandibular repositioning are highly effective for mild to moderate OSA and snoring.  

# Continuous positive airway pressure  (CPAP) machine  

• Probably the best, non-surgical treatment			 for reducing AHI when used consistently			 over six hours a night  

• Uses air pressure to hold the tissues open			 during sleep

• Decreases daytime				 sleepiness, as 			 measured by 			 surveys and 			 objective tests  

• Improves cognitive			 functioning on 			 tests  

# Surgical Methods  

These can be very significant surgeries that  don’t always succeed and can lead to side  effects. They should be used only after non- surgical methods have failed.  

• Nasal airway surgery: Corrects for swelling of the turbinates, septal deviation, and nasal polyps.  

• Palate implants: Stiffen the palate to prevent it from collapsing.  

• Uv ul opal a toph ary n gop last y (UPPP): Prevents collapse of the palate, tonsils, and pharynx.  

• Tongue reduction surgery: Decreases the size of the base of the tongue. • Genioglossus advancement: Pulls the tongue forward to enlarge the airway. • Max ill o mandibular Advancement (MMA), Moves the upper jaw (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible) forward.Cpap image  

# The Bottom Line  

If you experience one or more symptoms of  obstructive sleep apnea, it is recommended that  you consult a doctor, since treatment for OSA is  effective for decreasing fatigue and increasing  aviation safety.  

What about your medical certificate? If your  OSA is treatable, you can maintain your airman  medical certificate and continue to enjoy your  aviation career.  

However, flying with untreated OSA constitutes  an unnecessary risk and can become a safety- of-flight issue.

# Asleep at the controls  

On a daytime flight in 2008, a commercial  aircraft with three crewmembers and 40  passengers flew past its destination airport  after both the captain and first officer fell  asleep. Pilot's flying  

![](images/d464f41f982597dd43c284a0499976c4ad036267a94a6cdfbeba3e0e08670a07.jpg)  

The pilot awoke and turned back to the   destination airport, where all deplaned safely--  but behind schedule.  

The National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) determined that contributing factors to  the incident were the captain’s undiagnosed  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the flight  crew’s recent work schedules, which included  several days of early-morning start times.  

Up to that time, OSA was relatively unknown  outside the medical community.  

Today, OSA is recognized as the primary  source of sleep-disordered breathing (SD) and  a major contributor to many possible health- related chronic health conditions.  

The NTSB listed OSA on its “Most Wanted”  list of Transportation Safety Improvements for  2015 in North America:  

•	  $10–15\%$   of females and  $_{20-30\%}$   of males   	 have OSA •	  $15\%$   of males and  $5\%$   of females are   	 confirmed through diagnosis  

OSA affects:  

•  $70\%$   of morbid obese patients  •  $70\%$   of patients with Type II diabetes  •  $40\%$   of patients with hypertension •  $30\%$   of patients with morning headache •  $\scriptstyle{20\%}$   of veterans  

# The pathophysiology of OSA  

Apnea means “being without respiration.”  

Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized  as a repetitive upper airway obstruction  during sleep, as a result of narrowing of the  respiratory passages.  

Mild OSA is defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea  Index (AHI) of   $5{\mathrm{-}}15/{\mathrm{hr}}$   and severe OSA as an   $\mathsf{A H I}>30/\mathsf{h r}$  . Moderate OSA would fall between  these ranges.OSA diagram

Most people with this disorder are overweight  and have higher deposits of adipose (fatty)  tissue in their respiratory passages, and the  size of their soft palates and tongues are  larger than average.  

These conditions decrease the size of the  upper airway and decrease airway muscle  tone, especially when sleeping in the supine  (back down and horizontal) position.  

Gravity can pull tissue down and over the  airway, further decreasing its size, impeding  air flow to the lungs during inhalation.  

# The major impact of OSA  

Snoring can result when the airway becomes  partially obstructed. With further tissue  obstruction of the airway, there may be  complete occlusion. Whether the obstruction  is partial (hypopnea) or total (apnea), the  patient struggles to breathe and is aroused  from sleep.  Often, these sleep interruptions are  

unrecognized, even if they occur hundreds of  

times a night. The real danger is that the OSA  sufferers may not realize the condition and are  only aware that they typically awaken feeling  sleepy and tired.  

Losing sleep is more than a simple  inconvenience. Good, sound sleep is essential  for good health and clear mental and  emotional functioning.  

Additionally, OSA is associated with a  reduction in blood oxygen levels feeding the  brain, which, of course, is a major health  concern for neurocognitive deficit.  

# Repetitive decreases in blood oxygen  levels associated with OSA may eventually  increase:  

• Blood pressure • Strain on the cardiovascular system • Risk of heart attack • Risk of stroke • Risk of neurocognitive decline

# A potential problem in flight?  

The implications for pilots and crewmembers  are significant.  

It has been suggested that people with mild- to-moderate OSA can show performance  degradation equivalent to 0.06 to   $0.08\%$   blood  alcohol levels, which is the measure of legal  intoxication in most states.  

Most pilots will not fly intoxicated, but OSA  sleep deprivation may be causing the  equivalent effects! Further exacerbating the  problem are time zone changes and post- flight alcohol consumption, which can inhibit  wakefulness.  

The NTSB reported a six fold increase in the  risk of aviation crashes for pilots with OSA.  

Normally, when you stop breathing while  asleep, the brain automatically sends a  wake-up call after about 10 seconds, and you  wake up, gasping for air.  

Multiple time zone changes and alcohol  consumption inhibit arousal mechanisms  and may result in oxygen deprivation of  30 seconds or longer before you heed the  wake-up call. When you add up the oxygen  starvation resulting from many occurrences  per night, along with the subsequent arousals,  the effect is significant fatigue.  

# Recognizing OSA  

Typically, a person suffering from OSA is not  aware of the condition.  

The only way it can be objectively detected  is through various forms of sleep studies.  A complaint of loud and excessive snoring  may be an important clue, since that is  characteristically the first sign of OSA.
