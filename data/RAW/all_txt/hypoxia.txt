# BRIEFLY…  

•	When you breathe, you inhale oxygen and exhale  carbon dioxide.  

•	With each normal breath, you inhale about one- half liter of air,  $20\%$   of which is oxygen.  

•	At   $18{,}000^{,}$   MSL, you have half the sea level air  pressure; hence, only half the oxygen.  

•	Oxygen starvation first affects the brain; judgment  is impaired, so you may not know you are in  trouble.  

•	We all react differently to the effects of hypoxia.  Only physiological training can safely “break the  code” for you.  

# PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAINING   CLASSES FOR PILOTS  

The effects of hypoxia can be safely experienced  under professional supervision at the Civil  Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, or at  selected WINGS hypoxia demonstration events.  

If you are interested in taking a one-day aviation  physiological training course with altitude chamber  and vertigo demonstrations or a one-day survival  course, learn about how to sign up for these courses  that are offered CAMI by visiting this FAA Web site: https://www.faa.gov/go/aerophys  

You’ll learn to recognize your symptoms of hypoxia. It  could mean the difference between life and death.

HYPOXIA

The Higher You Fly… The Less Air In The Sky Breathing is one of the most automatic things we 
 do – over 20,000 times a day. Each breath does two  things for our body. It expels carbon dioxide when we  exhale, and takes in oxygen when we inhale. It’s a  delicate balance.  

Exercise or stress increases the production of carbon  dioxide so we breathe faster to eliminate it and take in  more oxygen at a greater rate.  

Because of the effects of gravity, the amount of air  containing oxygen is greater at sea level. For example, the  pressure at sea level is twice that found at 18,000 MSL.  

Although the percentage of oxygen contained in air at  18,000 feet is identical to that at sea level (a little over   $20\%$  ), the amount of air our lungs take in with each  breath contains half the oxygen found at sea level.  Breathing faster or more deeply doesn’t help. In fact,  because you’re consciously over-riding a system that is  normally automatic, you’ll be compounding the problem  by exhaling too much carbon dioxide.  

# SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN  

For Part 91 General Aviation operations the required  flight crew must use supplemental oxygen for any  portion of the flight that exceeds 30 minutes above a  cabin pressure altitude of 12,500 feet mean sea level  (MSL) up to and including 14,000 feet (MSL). The flight  crew must use supplemental oxygen for the entire  duration of flight operations above a cabin pressure  altitude of 14,000 feet MSL (14 CFR  $\S\,91.211$  ).  

In Part 135 Commuter and On Demand or Part 121 Air  Carrier operations in unpressurized aircraft the required  minimum flight crew must use supplemental oxygen  for that part of the flight that exceeds 30 minutes above  10,000 feet through 12,000 feet MSL. Above 12,000  feet MSL each member of the flight deck crew must use  supplemental oxygen during the entire portion of the  flight at those altitudes (14 CFR  $\S$   135.89,  $\S\ 135.157,\S$    121.327,   $\&\S$   121.329).  

For best protection, you are encouraged to use  supplemental oxygen above 10,000 feet MSL.  

At night, because vision is particularly sensitive to  diminished oxygen, a prudent rule is to use supplemental  oxygen when flying above 6,000 feet MSL.  

So, when you fly at high altitudes, supplemental oxygen  is the only solution. That’s because supplemental oxygen  satisfies the twin demands of having enough oxygen  to meet your body’s demands and a breathing rate that  excretes the right amount of carbon dioxide.  

# HYPOXIA  

Unfortunately, our body doesn’t give us reliable signals  at the onset of hypoxia – oxygen starvation – unless  we have received special training to recognize the  symptoms. In fact, it’s quite the contrary. The brain is  the first part of the body to reflect a diminished oxygen  supply, and the evidence of that is usually a loss 
 of judgment.  

# HYPOXIA TESTS  

Altitude chamber tests, in which high altitude flight  conditions are duplicated, have shown that some people  in an oxygen deficient environment actually experience  a sense of euphoria – a feeling of increased well-being.  These subjects can’t write their name intelligibly, or even  sort a deck of cards by suits…yet, they think they’re  doing just fine!  

![](images/77ed690eb6a2a8d5bf37cd9c64b83a807183555f7fe3165a047d2a9cb2fc0eed.jpg)  

Such is the insidious nature of oxygen deprivation. It  sneaks up on the unwary and steals the first line of  sensory protection – the sense that something is 
 wrong – dreadfully wrong.  

# THE HIGHER YOU GO  

Bear in mind, the progressive reduction of oxygen  per breath will continue the higher you go. Flying  above a layer of clouds that doesn’t look too high, or  flying in the mountains on a clear day – are the very  environments that have caused many good “flat-land”  pilots to get into trouble.  

# SYMPTOMS  

Everyone’s response to hypoxia varies. Unless, as  we’ve stated, you’ve had special training to recognize  its symptoms, hypoxia doesn’t give you much warning.  It steals up on you, giving your body subtle clues.  The order of symptoms varies among individuals:  increased breathing rate, headache, lightheadedness,  dizziness, tingling or warm sensations, sweating,  poor coordination, impaired judgment, tunnel vision,  and euphoria. Unless detected early and dealt with,  hypoxia can be a real killer.  

# CAUTION AND SAFETY  

So, don’t decide you’ll try to fly over that range of  mountains, thinking you’ll turn back if you start to  feel badly. You may feel great…until it’s too late! Use  supplemental oxygen.  

# SMOKING AND ALTITUDE  

A Western state pilot lived to tell about this one.  Cruising at 13,500 feet MSL over mountainous terrain  in his light single, he took a deep drag on his cigarette  and next remembered being in a screaming dive with  just enough altitude left in which to pull out! That  deep drag replaced precious oxygen in his brain with  carbon monoxide…and he passed out.
