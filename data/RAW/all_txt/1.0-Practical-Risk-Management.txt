Tips for Teaching Practical Risk Management  

# PURPOSE  

Flying involves risk. To stay safe you need to know how to judge the level of risk, how to minimize it, and

when to acceptit. This guide introduces risk management tools thatyou can use and teach to your flight training clients.  

# PROFILE  

A hazard is a condition, event, object, or circumstance that could lead to an undesired event -- like an accident.For example:  

·Pilotis unfamiliar with local area, pro cedures,or terrain features.  

·Weather encountered  in flight  is worse than forecast.  

Airport has unusual features, such as high terrain or ongoing construction.  

·Flight dispatcher asks you to be sure to return the aircraft on time, because it is needed for someone's practical test later in the day.  

Riskis the potential impact of ahazard thatyou do notcontrol oreliminate.The level of risk is measured by the number of people or resources affected (expo- sure);the extent ofpossibleloss(sever- ity); andlikelihood of loss (probability).  

# PRACTICES  

A"teachable moment"occurs whena student can clearly see how specific in- formation or skills can be used in the real world.Youcanfind,orcreate,teachable momentsonrisk managementin every flight training activity: pattern work, air work in the local practice area,cross- country, flight review, or instrument proficiency check.Forexample:  

Sample Scenarios:  

1.Thepilotappears harried,fatigued,or stressed before a flight.Call attention to the consequences (risk) thatcanarise whenthe pilot is distracted，andask whatcan be done tolower the risk.

2. Ask"what-if" ques- tions on the risk of a mechanical issue that is not clearly a "no-go"item:  

What do you do if you find fuel stains under a wing?  

·What risk arises in a day VFR flight if the vacuum pump is inoperative? (Re- member to discuss 14 CFR 91.213!)  

3. Take the pilot out of his or her comfort zone by going to a place with unfamiliar airports,procedures,orterrain.Usecon- ditions that you find (e.g., out-of-service equipment) to teach the difference be- tween what is legal and what is safe for this particular pilot and aircraft.  

The Perceive-Process-Perform model of- fers a structured way to manage risk:  

Perceive hazards by looking at:  

Pilot experience, currency, condition Aircraft performance, fuel enVironment (weather, terrain) External pressures (appointments)  

rocess risk level by considering:  

Consequences posed byeachhazard Alternatives that eliminate hazards Reality (avoid wishful thinking!) Externalpressures(get-home-itus)  

Derform risk management:  

Transfer-can you consult someone? Eliminate - can you remove hazards? Accept -- do benefits outweigh risk? Mitigate -- can you reduce the risk?  

# OSTFLIGHT  

Toreinforcethe risk managementles- sons of theflight, ask questions that let the pilot learn by reflecting onhis orher actions and decisions at key moments:  

-What went well?  

·What could have been better?  

·What would I do differently?  

·What additional knowledge and skills do I need to safely handle (or avoid) this kind of situation?
