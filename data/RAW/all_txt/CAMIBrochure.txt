# The FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute...  

is the medical certification, CAMI research, education, and occupational health wingof theFAA's Office of Aerospace Medicine. The goal of our activities is to enhance aviation safety.  

After America's first successful flight in 1903, the first aviation fatality could not be far off. Amazingly, five years would pass before the first fatal accident. Since then, safety has been an important concern. In 1926, the Civil Aeronautics Act marshaled the talents of the medical profession to certify that all aviators are physically fit to fly.  

Thus, our principal concern at CAMI is the human element in flight—pilots, flight attendants, passengers, air traffic controllers-and the entire human support system that embraces civil aviation. We study the factors that influence human performancein the aerospace environment, find ways to understand them, and communicate that understanding to the aviation community.  

The Institute's people—-researchers, physicians and other medical specialists, engineers, educators, pilots, technicians, and communicators—all merged as a team in 1961 at our centralized Oklahoma City facility. Since then, the CAMI team's synergistic products serve people everywhere as they safely and routinely achieve one of the oldest of human dreams:Flight!

he Civil Aerospace Medical Institute has more than a dozen complex labs and large-scale, computerized health system and performance databases. Our most important resource is our staff. These professionals are dedicated to their work at the Institute—serving an aviation community and public that rely upon safe, dependable air transportation.  

# Aerospace Medical Certification  

Iince 1926, the Federal Aviation Administration has developed and utilized health standards to assure the safety of all who fly. By federal law, all aviators must be medically certified.  

The Aerospace Medical Certification Division's three branches administer the national medical certification program including a repository of airmer medical records and a system for processing about a half million medical applications annually.  

# Medical Review and Appeals  

·Determines the disposition of special issuances and appeal cases, manages medical elements of the DUI/DWI program, and develops national program guidance.  

# Medical Officer  

·Determines medical qualifications for complex medical conditions referred by legal instrument examiners for further review: supports specialty panels at the request of the Federal Air Surgeon and assists the Medical Education Division with seminar presentations.  

# Medical Systems  

· Manages automated systems for the collection and dissemination of medical and statistical data, including pilot records and EKG repository.

# AerospaceHuman Factors Research  

umanFactors arethecharacteristicsofhuman H beings that are applicable to the design of systems and devices of all kinds. These include selecting the right person for the job or determining the skills, tasks, training, and equipment that influence performance. This is especially important for safety-critical jobs like those of air crewmembers and air traffic controllers.  

Human Factors scientists perform these functions within two research laboratories:  

# Flight Deck  

.Determines the effects of stressors on human performance, identifies human factors involved in accidents and incidents, quantifies the effects of advanced FAA NextGen displays, procedures, and task design on pilot performance.  

# National Airspace System (NAS) Safety  

·Examines person-job fit through training and changes to technology and the relationship of factors affecting individuals, teams, and organizations in the work environment.
