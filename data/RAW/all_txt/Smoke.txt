# SMOKE TOXICITY  

# Th  e specter of ﬁ  re in the air is a pilot’s recurrent  nightmare...  

F IRE  is an integral part of our everyday life,  and smoke is one of its products. There  have always been efforts to control ﬁ  re  and use it for constructive purposes, but even  then, accidental ﬁ  res do occur and ﬁ  re contin- ues to cause loss of lives and property.  

Uncontrolled ﬁ  res threaten homes, facto- ries, and transportation systems. The specter  of ﬁ  re in the air is a pilot’s recurrent night- mare, carried over from the early days of fab- ric covered aircraft, when the time between  ignition and loss of the aircraft could be mea- sured in relatively few minutes.  

Modern aircraft beneﬁ  t from ﬂ  ame retardant  materials and improved ﬁ  re extinguishing sys- tems to such an extent that in-ﬂ  ight ﬁ  res are  rare occurrences.  

However, survivable crashes followed by  ﬁ  re happen, primarily from fuel spills around  the downed aircraft. In the conﬁ  ned environ- ment of an aircraft cabin, the presence of  smoke automatically indicates the existence of  an emergency situation.  

Extinguishment of ﬁ  res obviously has ﬁ  rst  priority, but smoke inhalation should be  recognized as a very real danger while this is  being accomplished. Inhalation of toxic gases  in smoke is the primary cause of fatalities in  most ﬁ  res—this is true whether the ﬁ  re is in  an aircraft cabin, a residential bedroom, or a  high-rise building. Smoke gases do not need  to reach lethal levels to seriously impair pilot  performance. Sublethal exposures can cause  even experienced pilots to make potentially  fatal mistakes.

In view of the seriousness of any aircraft  ﬁ  re, let us examine the various aspects of ﬁ  re  and smoke.  

# FIRE  

# Ea ch ﬁ  re is diﬀ  erent...  

F ire  is a complex, dynamic, physico- chemical event and is the result of a rapid  chemical reaction generating smoke, heat,   ame, and light. Each ﬁ  re is different. Smoke  composition and heat generated in a ﬁ  re de- pend on types of burning materials and envi- ronmental conditions.  

# SMOKE  

# I ts gases could be toxic...  

S moke  is a complex of particulate matter,  as well as a variety of invisible combus- tion gases and vapors suspended in the   re atmosphere. Smoke may diminish light and  obscure vision, and its gases could be toxic.  

# SMOKE GASES  

Carbon dioxide levels increase and oxygen  concentrations decrease...  

C arbon monoxide  and hydrogen cyanide  are the two principal toxic combustion  gases. Most cabin furnishings contain  carbon and will generate both carbon monox- ide and carbon dioxide when burned; carbon  monoxide can also be released from faulty  cabin heaters. Burning wool, silk, and many  

nitrogen-  containing synthetics will produce the  more toxic hydrogen cyanide gas. Irritant gases,  such as hydrogen chloride and acrolein, are  generated from burning wiring insulation and  some other cabin materials. Generally, carbon  dioxide levels increase and oxygen concentra- tions decrease during ﬁ  res.  

# SMOKE EFFECTS  

# At high altitude, the effects are greatly  e nhanced...  

V isual smoke  can delay escape from a  ﬁ  re, while the irritant gases can induce  tears, pain, and disorientation. The visu- al obscuration is obvious, but the subtle effects  of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide  inhalation, although less readily detected, can  cause physical incapacitation and subsequent  death. Toxicologically, carbon monoxide com- bines with the hemoglobin in blood and inter- feres with the oxygen supply to tissues, while  hydrogen cyanide inhibits oxygen utilization at  the cellular level. Carbon dioxide, a relatively  innocuous ﬁ  re gas, increases the respiration  rate causing an increase in the uptake of the  other combustion gases. The decreased oxygen  level found in most ﬁ  re scenarios further en- hances the problem of getting enough oxygen  to the biological sites to maintain normal func- tion. Continued inhalation of these gases can  result in severe hypoxia. At high altitude where  oxygen levels are lower, the effects of carbon  monoxide and hydrogen cyanide are greatly  enhanced.  

# SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS  

Not all symptoms will necessarily be  expe rienced...  

C arbon monoxide  poisoning produces  headache, weakness, nausea, dizzi- ness, confusion, dimness of vision,  disturbance of judgment, and unconsciousness  followed by coma and death.   Although carbon  monoxide causes deleterious effects on the  central nervous system, death usually occurs  from cardiotoxicity.  

Not all symptoms will necessarily be expe- rienced by every individual exposed to this  gas. Some have succumbed from inhaling low  carbon monoxide levels, while others   have  survived breathing higher concentrations.  Hydrogen cyanide poisoning signs and symp- toms are weakness, dizziness, headache, nau- sea, vomiting, coma, convulsions, and death.  Death results from respiratory arrest. Hydro- gen cyanide gas acts very rapidly—symptoms  and death can both occur quickly.  

# SURVIVAL  

# Knowledge of the less obvious hazards and a few  simple preparations can increase   one’s chances...  

T here is no  universal best procedure to fol- low in the event of an aircraft ﬁ  re because  no two ﬁ  res are likely to be the same. Ex- tinguishing the ﬁ  re, if possible, is the immediate  priority. An equally obvious second priority is  to breathe as little smoke for as short a duration  as possible.  

Some larger aircraft are supplied with por- table, self-contained breathing masks for the  crew, but small private aircraft usually are not.  Any cloth held over the nose and mouth will  provide protection from smoke particulates; if  the cloth is wet, it will also absorb most of the  water-soluble gases (i.e., hydrogen cyanide  and hydrogen chloride).  

Cabin venting will reduce the concentra- tions of combustion gases, but is not usually a  viable option while actually ﬁ  ghting the ﬁ  re.  Knowledge of the less obvious hazards and  a few simple preparations can increase one’s  chances for survival in an aircraft ﬁ  re. A small,  hand-held ﬁ  re extinguisher can be used to put  out small onboard ﬁ  res. Careful inspection  and maintenance of cabin heaters will mini- mize the chance of carbon monoxide leakage  into the cabin air system. A carbon monoxide  detector could also be installed in the cock- pit to detect the presence of this colorless,  odorless gas. As always, planning your prob- able actions before an emergency arises will  increase your chances for acting quickly and  correctly.  

# Remember...  

• Fires  are the main hazard for the occu- pants of a survivable crash  • A ﬁ  re  generates smoke, heat, ﬂ  ame, and  light  $\bullet$  Inhalation of toxic gases in smoke  is the primary cause of death in most  ﬁ  res  • Carbon monoxide  and hydrogen cyanide  are the main toxic gases in smoke  • Exposure  to carbon monoxide can also be  the result of faulty heaters  • A wet cloth  held over the nose and  mouth provides some protection from  smoke inhalation  • A small, hand-held  ﬁ  re extinguisher  should always be carried aboard general  aviation aircraft  • Install a carbon monoxide detector  in the  cockpit
