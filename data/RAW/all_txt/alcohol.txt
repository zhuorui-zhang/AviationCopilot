# You are in control  

# Department of Transportation (DOT)/  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  14 CFR Part 120 - Drug and Alcohol  Testing Program Regulations  

Flying, while fun and exciting, is a precise,  demanding, and unforgiving endeavor.  Any factor that impairs the pilot’s ability  to perform the required tasks during the  operation of an aircraft is an invitation 
 for disaster.  The use of alcohol is a significant self-imposed  stress factor that should be eliminated from  the cockpit. The ability to do so is strictly  within the pilot’s control.  

The FAA drug and alcohol testing regulation  applies to pilots who perform flight crewmember  duties (directly or by contract) for a domestic  commercial air carrier or operator. The FAA’s  rule defines who is subject to testing, the types of  testing, consequences, prohibitions for using drugs  or misusing alcohol, and other administrative  requirements. The DOT’s procedural regulation,  49 CFR part 40, outlines the specimen collection,  testing, and verification procedures for all DOT  testing. Employees that have a breath alcohol  test result confirmed with a concentration of   $0.04$   or greater alcohol or other alcohol misuse  prohibition while performing flight crewmember  duties must be immediately removed from duty  and referred for education and/or treatment.  A breath alcohol test confirmed between 0.02  and 0.039 is not considered a federal testing  

# Alcohol avoidance  

Ideally, total avoidance of alcohol should  be a key element observed by every pilot in  planning or accomplishing a flight.  

Alcohol avoidance is as critical as developing  a flight plan, a good preflight inspection,  obeying ATC procedures, and avoiding 
 severe weather.  

violation; however, the employee must be temporarily  removed from duty until they test below 0.02 or  for 8 hours. Safety-sensitive employees must be  subject to pre-employment, random, post-accident,  random, reasonable cause/suspicion, return-to- duty, and follow-up testing.

# General Recommendations  

1. As a  minimum , adhere to all the guidelines
	 of 14 CFR Part 91.17:	 • 8 hours from “bottle to throttle”	 • do not fly while under the influence of alcohol	 • do not fly while using any drug that may
	 adversely affect safety  

2. A more conservative approach is to wait 24 hours
	 from the last use of alcohol before flying. This
	 is especially true if intoxication occurred or if you
	 plan to fly IFR. Cold showers, drinking black
	 coffee, or breathing   $100\%$   oxygen cannot speed up
	 the elimination of alcohol from the body.  

3. Consider the effects of a hangover. Eight hours
	 from “bottle to throttle” does not mean you are
	 in the best physical condition to fly, or that
	 your blood alcohol concentration is below the
	 legal limits.  

4. Recognize the hazards of combining alcohol
	 consumption and flying.  

5. Use good judgment. Your life and the lives of
	 your passengers are at risk if you drink and fly.
	 Keep in mind that regulations alone are no
	 guarantee that problems won’t occur. It is far
	 more important for pilots to understand the
	 negative effects of alcohol and its deadly impact
	 on flight safety.  

# ALCOHOL USE IN AMERICA  

•	 Over  $67.4\%$   of American adults consume alcohol. •	 In  $2022\;23.5\%$   of American adults reported that they engaged in binge drinking in the past month. •	 In   $2022~11.2\%$   adults had Alcohol Use Disorder in the past year. •	 Different alcoholic beverages have different concentrations of alcohol; however, their total alcohol content can be the same. For example, a pint of beer contains as much alcohol as a  $5\%.$  -ounce glass of table wine. Therefore, the notion that drinking low- concentration alcoholic beverages is safer than drinking hard liquor is erroneous. •	 The total alcohol content of any alcoholic beverage can be easily calculated using the following formula: “Proof” divided by  $2=$  percent pure alcohol by volume.

Alcoholic beverages, used by many to “unwind” or relax,  act as a social “icebreaker,” a way to alter one’s mood by  decreasing inhibitions. Alcohol consumption is widely  accepted, often providing the cornerstone of social  gatherings and celebrations. Along with cigarettes, many  adolescents associate the use of alcohol as a rite of passage  into adulthood.  

# The erratic effects of alcohol  

•	  Alcohol is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine, and transported by the blood throughout the body. Its toxic effects vary considerably from person to person, and is influenced by variables such as gender, body weight, rate of consumption (time), and total  

amount consumed. •	 The average, healthy person eliminates pure alcohol at a fairly constant rate. That is about  $\%$   to  $\%$   oz. of pure alcohol per hour. This is equivalent to the amount of pure alcohol contained in any of the popular drinks listed in Table 1. This rate of elimination of alcohol is relatively constant, regardless of the total amount of alcohol consumed. In other words, whether a person consumes a few or many drinks, the rate of elimination of alcohol from the body is essentially the same. Therefore, the more alcohol an individual consumes, the longer it takes the body to get rid of it. •	 Even after complete elimination of all of the alcohol in the body, there are hangover effects that can last 48 to 72 hours following the last drink. •	 The majority of adverse effects produced by alcohol relate to the brain, eyes, and inner ear which are three crucial organs to a pilot.  

While its use is prevalent and acceptable in our society,  it should not come as a surprise that problems arise in  the use of alcohol and the performance of safety-related  activities, such as driving an automobile or flying an  aircraft. These problems are made worse by the common  belief that accidents happen “to other people, but not to  me.” There is a tendency to forget that flying an aircraft is  a highly demanding cognitive and psychomotor task that  takes place in an inhospitable environment where pilots  are exposed to various sources of stress.  

# Hard facts about alcohol  

•	 It’s a sedative, hypnotic, and addicting drug.

  $\bullet$   Alcohol quickly impairs judgment and leads to behavior that can easily contribute to, or cause accidents.

Table 1. Amount of alcohol in various alcoholic beverages.  

•	 Brain effects include impaired reaction time, reasoning, judgment, and memory. Alcohol decreases the ability of the brain to make use of oxygen. This adverse effect can be magnified as a result of simultaneous exposure to altitude, characterized by a decreased partial
 pressure of oxygen. •	 Visual symptoms include eye muscle imbalance, which leads to double vision and difficulty focusing. •	 Inner ear effects include dizziness, and decreased hearing perception. •	 If such other variables are added as sleep deprivation, fatigue, medication use, altitude hypoxia, or flying at night or in bad weather, the negative effects are significantly magnified.

# Studies of how alcohol affects pilot  performance  

•	 Pilots have shown impairment in their ability to fly an ILS approach or to fly IFR, and even to perform routine VFR flight tasks while under the influence of alcohol, regardless of individual flying experience.

 •	 The number of serious errors committed by pilots dramatically increases at or above concentrations of   $0.04\%$   blood alcohol. This is not to say that problems don’t occur below this value. Some studies have shown decrements in pilot performance with blood alcohol concentrations as low as the  $0.025\%$  .

# Hangovers are dangerous  

A hangover effect, produced by alcoholic  1   beverages after the acute intoxication has worn off,  may be just as dangerous as the intoxication itself.  Symptoms commonly associated with a hangover  are headache, dizziness, dry mouth, stuffy nose,  fatigue, upset stomach, irritability, impaired  judgment, and increased sensitivity to bright light.  A pilot with these symptoms would certainly not  be fit to safely operate an aircraft. In addition,  such a pilot could readily be perceived as being  under the influence of alcohol.  

# Alcohol tolerance  

Alcohol tolerance occurs when the brain  and body change over time to compensate  for the sedative effects of alcohol.  Tolerance  is dangerous. Tolerant individuals can still  perform complex tasks at high BACs despite  cognitive impairment.  

Under 14 CFR Part 67, tolerance is evidence  of alcohol dependence.   It can develop with  daily or periodic heavy or binge drinking.   Tolerant individuals must drink more in  order to get the same effect they used to get  with fewer drinks.  For example, non-tolerant  individuals have difficulty with complex tasks  at a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of  0.08, while tolerant individuals may perform  the same tasks at much higher BAC levels  (e.g.,  $0.16)^{2}$  .  However, tolerant individuals  only “appear” to maintain cognitive function  and motor skills at higher levels of blood  alcohol.  Actual cognition and judgment are  still impaired.  

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and  Alcoholism (NIAAA) argues that alcohol  related problems (including tolerance)  increase for men who drink 5 or more  standard drinks in a day (or more than 14  per week) and women who drink 4 or more  in a day (or more than 7 per week).   The  medical literature shows that individuals who  have minimal observable effects at BACs of   $0.20\%$   or higher are tolerant.   Higher body  weight is no protection against tolerance or  dependence.  Airmen with higher body weight  may actually show tolerance or dependence at   ${\mathrm{BAC}}s$   as low as   $0.15\%$  .
