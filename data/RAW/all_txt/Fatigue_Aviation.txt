# LIFESTYLE RECOMMENDATIONS  

# Don't...  

Consume alcohol or caffeine 3-4hoursbefore going to bed.  

Eat a heavy meal just before bedtime. Takeworktobed.  

Exercise2-3hoursbeforebedtime.While working out promotes a healthy lifestyle, it shouldn't be done too close to bedtime.  

Use sleeping pills (prescription or otherwise)  

# Do...  

Be mindful of the side effects of certain medications,evenover-the-counter medications-drowsiness or impaired alertness is a concern.  

Consult a physician to diagnose and treat any medical conditions causing sleep problems.  

Create a comfortable sleep environment at home. Adjust heating and cooling as needed Get a comfortable mattress.  

When traveling, select hotels that provide a comfortable environment.  

Get into the habit of sleeping eight hours per night. When needed, and if possible napduringtheday,but limit the nap to less than 30 minutes. Longer naps produce sleep inertia,which is counterproductive

FATIGUE IN AVIATION  

Trytoturn in at the sametime each day.This establishes a routine and helps you fall asleep quicker.  

lfyoucan't fall asleep within 30 minutes of going to bed, get up and try an activity that helps induce sleep(watch non-violent TV, read, listen to relaxing music, etc).  

Get plenty of rest and minimize stress before aflight.If problems preclude a goodnight's sleep,rethinktheflightandpostponeit accordingly.  

Fatigue is an expected and ubiquitous aspect of life For the average individual, fatigue presents a minor inconvenience,resolved with a nap or by stopping whatever activity that brought it on. Typically, there are no significant consequences. However, if that person is involved insafety-related activities such as operating a motor vehicle, piloting an aircraft, performing surgery, or running a nuclear reactor,theconsequences of fatiguecanbe disastrous.  

# DEFINITION  

Defining fatigue in humans is extremely difficult due to the large variability of causes. Causes of fatigue can range from boredom to circadian rhythm disruption to heavy physical exertion. In lay terms, fatigue can simply be defined as weariness. However, from an operational standpoint a more accurate definition might be: "Fatigue is a condition characterized by increased discomfort with lessened capacity for work,reduced efficiency of accomplishment,loss of power or capacity to respond to stimulation, and is usually accompanied by a feeling ofweariness and tiredness."  

# TWOKEYCONCEPTSCANBEDERIVED EROMTHISSECONDDEFINITION  

1. Fatigue can develop from a variety of sources. The important factor is not what causes the fatigue but rather the negative impact fatigue has on a person's ability toperform tasks.A long dayofmental stimulationsuch asstudying for an examination or processing data for a report can be as fatiguing as manual labor. They may feel different—a sore body instead of a headache and bleary eyes——but the end effect is the same,an inability to function normally.  

2.Fatigue leads to a decrease in your ability to carry outtasks.Several studies have demonstrated significant impairment in a person's ability to carryout tasks that require manual dexterity concentration,and higher-order intellectual processing.Fatigue may happen acutely,whichis to say in a relatively short time(hours)aftersome significant physical or mental activity.  

Or, it may occur gradually over several days or weeks. Typically,this situation occurs with someone who does notgetsufficientsleepoveraprolongedperiodoftime (as with sleep apnea,jetlag,orshiftwork)orsomeone who is involved in ongoing physical or mental activity with insufficient rest.  

# STRESSORS  

General aviationpilots aretypicallynot exposed to the same occupational stresses as commercial pilots (i.e., long duty days, circadian disruptions from night flying or time zone changes,or scheduling changes). Nevertheless,they will still develop fatigue from a variety

of other causes. Given the single-pilot operation and relatively higher workload,they would be just as much at risk (possibly even more) to be involved in an accident than a commercial crew.Any fatigued person will exhibit the same problems: sleepiness,difficulty concentrating, apathy,feeling of isolation,annoyance,increased reaction time to stimulus,slowing ofhigher-level mental functioning, decreased vigilance,memory problems, task fixation, and increased errorswhile performing tasks.  

None of these are good things to have happen to a pilot, much less if there is no one else in the aircraft to help out.  

In a variety of studies,fatigued individuals consistently under reported how tired they really were,as measured by physiologic parameters. A tired individual truly does not realize the extent of actual impairment. No degree of experience,motivation,medication, coffee,orwillpowercanovercomefatigue.  

# ANTIDOTE TO FATIGUE  

Obtaining adequatesleepis thebestway toprevent or resolve fatigue. Sleep provides the body with a period of rest and recuperation. Insufficient sleep will result in significant physical and psychological problems. On average, a healthy adult does best with eight hours of uninterrupted sleep, but significant personal variations occur. For example, increasing sleep difficulties occur as we age,with significant shortening of nighttime sleep. A variety of medical conditions can influence the quality andduration of sleep. To name a few: sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome,certain medications,depression,stress insomnia,and chronic pain. Some of the more common social orbehavioral issues are:late-night activities,excessive alcohol or caffeine use,travel interpersonal strife,uncomfortable orunfamiliar surroundings,andshiftwork.  

# PREVENTION  

No one is immune from fatigue. Yet, in our society, establishing widespread preventive measures to combat fatigue is often a very difficult goal to achieve. Individuals, as well as organizations, often ignore the problem until an accident occurs. Even then, implementing lasting change is not guaranteed Lifestyle changes are not easy for individuals particularly if that person isn't in complete control of the condition.For example,commercial pilots must contend with shift work and circadian rhythm disruption. Often, they also choose to commute long distances to work, so that by the time a work cycle starts they have already traveled for several hours. While a general aviation pilot may not have to deal with this, a busy lifestyle or other issues may lead to fatigue. Therefore, general aviation pilots must make every effort tomodify personal lifestyle factors that causefatigue.
