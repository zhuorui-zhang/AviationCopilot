Developing a Personal Fitness Program T he purpose of this brochure is to provide you with basic  guidelines for developing a balanced physical fitness program  and customizing a workout to fit your needs.  We recommend that  you consult a physician before starting any type of physical fitness  program. Additionally, an exercise physiologist or professional  trainer can help you personalize a specific fitness program.  

# Benefits of Being Physically Fit  

“Use it or lose it!” That old saying not only relates to certain flying  skills but also to the human body. Muscles that aren’t used tend  to atrophy and weaken. To keep muscles and the cardiovascular  system working at their optimum levels, they must be stimulated  and utilized. Being more physically fit will generally make you  look and feel better. Additionally, people that carry too much  weight or are bordering on obesity often encounter many health- related problems, ranging from chronic backaches to advanced  cardiovascular disease. Finally, a high level of personal fitness can  help you to cope with the various emotional and physical stressors  that are encountered in the flight environment.  

# Get a Physical  

Before starting a physical fitness program, it is very important  that you get a thorough physical examination. Make sure that you  tell your medical professional of your intentions to start a fitness  program and get some guidance. Also, it would be a good idea  to consult with your AME (aviation medical examiner). These  professionals can help to tailor a program that addresses the  demands of the flight environment.  

# A Change in Lifestyle  

Always keep in mind that becoming fit requires a lifestyle change:  adjusting your diet, eating the appropriate types of food with ideal  portions, deciding to walk a short trip rather than to drive it, taking  the stairs instead of the elevator. These all require a different frame  of mind and a change in your daily routine. That, in itself, can be a  stressor. Your body will be tasking muscles and systems more than  ever. With the accompanying muscle soreness and fatigue, many  get discouraged and simply give up. Start out slow. Gradually  increase the intensity of your program as your body adjusts to this  new lifestyle. But…don’t quit!  

# Basic Components of a Fitness Program  

An effective fitness program includes the following:  

•  Warm-up •  Flexibility and stretching •  Aerobic conditioning •  Anaerobic conditioning •  Cool-down and stretching

# The Warm-Up and Stretchwoman workingout  

The warm-up is an essential part of your  workout. It should be adjusted to meet  the needs of the type of exercise you  plan to perform. Warming your muscles  gives the body a chance to deliver plenty  of nutrient-rich blood to areas about to  be exercised and lubricates the joints.  The second part of the warm-up process  should include stretching. Its purpose  is to increase and maintain muscle  flexibility by increasing blood flow to  the muscles. Stretching should never  

overextend the muscle or cause it to burn. With the increase in  flexibility and range of movement, stretching decreases the risk of  injury.  

# Aerobic (Cardio) Conditioning  

Your workout should then involve an aerobic (better known as  cardio) activity. Aerobic exercise is any activity that uses large  muscle groups, can be maintained continuously, and is rhythmic  in nature. The exercise tasks the heart and lungs, causing them to  work harder than when at rest.  

Some examples of aerobic activities:  

•  Bicycling (on a stationary bike, if preferred) •  Fitness walking (treadmill, if preferred) •  Jumping rope  

•  Running or jogging (treadmill, if preferred) •  Stair climbing (or Stairmaster, if preferred)  

•  Swimming •  Organized sports like softball, basketball, volleyball,  racquetball  

# Anaerobic (Resistance) Conditioning  

The effectiveness of your workout would be greatly diminished if  it didn’t include some type of anaerobic, or resistance training, as  a basic component. This type of training tasks a particular muscle  or muscle group to increase its strength and/or tone. Exercises can  be done by using free-weights, resistance machines, and resistance  bands. While free-weights have the advantage of being the most  effective, they also have the disadvantage of being less safe.  Machines are inherently safer but are less effective. No matter  which route you choose, you should always consult a Certified  Fitness Professio inage customizing a “l Some examples  

•  Squat •  Bench Pre •  Deadlift •  Bicep Curl •  Triceps Ex •  Military Pr •  Row  

# Cool-Down  

This is the finishing touch to your workout, a very important part  of an overall workout because it keeps the body active, prevents  the blood from pooling in your extremities, and flushes the muscles  of lactic acid. The cool-down should be performed at a low- intensity of effort, starting with the major muscle groups. Similar  to the start of our workout, the cool-down period should also  involve stretching. A good cool-down with stretching also helps to  limit muscle soreness later.  

Nutritional Considerations Food Proper nutrition, fluid intake, rest, and  recuperation are important factors for  any healthy lifestyle. As your exercise  routine increases, these components  become more important, as the body  needs adequate supplies of these

ingredients to function properly. Eating well-balanced meals  helps to replenish the nutritional needs of muscles and aids in  recuperating from your workouts. A well-balanced meal involves  being aware of your intake—especially proteins, carbohydrates,  and fats. Most individuals involved in a moderate exercise lifestyle  benefit from a diet consisting of meals that are   $50–55\%$   complex  carbohydrates,   $15{-}20\%$   protein, and  $25–35\%$   fat. However, the  carbohydrate and protein intake percentages should change,  depending on the purpose of your exercise program.  

Dehydration is a problem for most people, especially when they  begin a fitness program. Exercisers should drink more water than  ever before to avoid fatigue and cramping. The average, sedentary  person needs two to four quarts of water every 24 hours for normal  functioning. Depending on the workout, the weather, and your  physical condition, your water intake will need to be increased.  

# Your Exercise Program  

•  Can be very simple or very complex in nature  

•  Should fit your personal needs, lifestyle, and personality •  Should start slowly and build as you adapt; the old sports  adage, “no pain, no gain,” can be very harmful and should by  replaced by “in all things, moderation.”
