# INTRODUCTION  

This Chart Users’ Guide is an introduction to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) aeronautical charts and publica- tions. It is useful to new pilots as a learning aid, and to experienced pilots as a quick reference guide.  

The FAA is the source for all data and information utilized in the publishing of aeronautical charts through authorized pub- lishers for each stage of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) air navigation including training, plan- ning, departures, enroute (for low and high altitudes), approaches, and taxiing charts. Digital charts are available online at:  

•	VFR Charts•	 IFR Charts •	 Terminal Procedures Publication •	 Chart Supplements  

Paper copies of the charts are available through an FAA Approved Print Provider. A complete list of current providers is  available at  http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/print_providers /.  

The FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) Pilot/Controller Glossary defines all terms and abbreviations used  throughout this publication. Unless otherwise indicated, miles are nautical miles (NM), altitudes indicate feet above Mean  Sea Level (MSL), and times used are Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  

Notices to Air Missions (NOTAMs) alert pilots to time-critical aeronautical information that is either temporary or not suf- ficiently known in advance to permit publication on aeronautical charts or in other operational publications. Pilots can  access NOTAM information via Flight Service Stations (FSS) or online via NOTAM Search at  https://notams.aim.faa.gov/ notamSearch/ .  

In addition to NOTAMs, the Safety Alerts/Charting Notices page of the Aeronautical Information Services website is also  useful to pilots.  

# KEEP YOUR CHARTS CURRENT  

Aeronautical information changes rapidly, so it is impor- tant that pilots check the effective dates on each aeronau- tical chart and publication. To avoid danger, it is important  to always use current editions and discard obsolete  charts and publications.  

To confirm that a chart or publication is current, refer to  the next scheduled edition date printed on the cover.  Pilots should also check NOTAMs for important updates  between chart and publication cycles that are essential  for safe flight.  

# EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHART USERS’ GUIDE  AND UPDATES  

All information in this guide is effective as of  5 September  2024 . All graphics used in this guide are for educational  purposes. Chart symbology may not be to scale. Please  do not use them for flight navigation.  

The Chart Users’ Guide is published in accordance with  the 56-day aeronautical chart product schedule.  

# COLOR VARIATION  

Although the digital files are compiled in accordance with  charting specifications, the final product may vary slightly in  appearance due to differences in printing techniques/pro- cesses and/or digital display techniques.  

# REPORTING CHART DISCREPANCIES  

Your experience as a pilot is valuable and your feedback is  important. We make every effort to display accurate informa- tion on all FAA charts and publications, so we appreciate  your input. Please notify us concerning any requests for  changes, or potential discrepancies you see while using our  charts and related products.

# WHAT’S NEW?  

Update as of 5 September 2024  

The following charting items have been added to the Chart Users’ Guide since the Guide was last published on 11 July  2024:  

# VFR CHARTS  

No Significant Changes Applied  

# IFR ENROUTE CHARTS  

No Significant Changes Applied  

# TERMINAL PROCEDURE PUBLICATION (TPP)  

Starting with the October 31, 2024 publication cycle, Aeronautical Information Services (AIS) will begin charting stopways,  overruns and blast pads on airport diagrams using a chevron symbol to indicate that these surfaces are not available for  taxiing. Currently, Stopways/Overruns and Blast Pads are charted in gray and are labeled with dimensions when specifi- cally requested by an airport. When these surfaces are depicted using the new chevron symbol they will no longer be  labeled, nor will dimensions be provided. See the airport diagram on page 122 for examples of the new symbol.  

# EXPLANATION OF VFR TERMS AND SYMBOLS  

This chapter covers the Sectional Aeronautical Chart (Sectional). These charts include the most current data at a scale  of (1:500,000), which is large enough to be read easily by pilots flying by sight under Visual Flight Rules. Sectionals are  named after a major city within its area of coverage.  

The chart legend includes aeronautical symbols and information about drainage, terrain, the contour of the land, and  elevation. You can learn to identify aeronautical, topographical, and obstruction symbols (such as radio and television tow- ers) by using the legend.  

A brief description next to a small black square indicates the exact location for many of the landmarks easily recognized  from the air, such as stadiums, pumping stations, refineries, etc. A small black open circle with descriptive type indicates  oil, gas or mineral wells. A small black circle with descriptive type indicates water, oil or gas tanks. The scale for some  items may be increased to make them easier to read on the chart.  

Aeronautical Information Services' charts are prepared in accordance with specifications of the Interagency Air Committee  (IAC) and are approved by representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Defense  (DoD).  

# WATER FEATURES (HYDROGRAPHY)  

![](images/41d1fd780780dc36f5ad527c84239b476f9bf59b77c6a78c63ae380b9eaeaab3.jpg)  

Water features are depicted using two tones of blue, and are considered either "Open Water" or  "Inland Water." "Open Water," a lighter blue tone, shows the shoreline limitations of all coastal water  features at the average (mean) high water levels for oceans and seas. Light blue also represents the  connecting waters like bays, gulfs, sounds and large estuaries.  

Exceptionally large lakes like the Great Lakes, Great Salt Lake, and Lake Okeechobee, etc., are considered Open Water  features. The Open Water tone extends inland as far as necessary to adjoin the darker blue "Inland Water" tones. All other  bodies of water are marked as "Inland Water" in the darker blue tone.  

# LAND FEATURES (TERRAIN) AND OBSTRUCTIONS  

The elevation and configuration of the Earth's surface is important to pilots. Our Aeronautical Information Specialists are  devoted to showing the contour of the earth and any obstructions clearly and accurately on our charts. We use five differ- ent techniques: contour lines, shaded relief, color tints, obstruction symbols, and Maximum Elevation Figures (MEF).  

1.	 Contour lines join points of equal elevation. On Sectionals, basic contours are spaced at  500' intervals. Intermediate contours are typically at   $_{250^{\circ}}$   intervals in moderately level or  gently rolling areas. Auxiliary contours at 50', 100', 125', or 150' intervals occasionally  show smaller relief features in areas of relatively low relief. The pattern of these lines  and their spacing gives the pilot a visual concept of the terrain. Widely spaced contours represent gentle slopes,  while closely spaced contours represent steep slopes.  

2.	 Shaded relief shows how terrain may appear from the air. Shadows are shown as if light is    coming from the northwest, because studies have shown that our visual perception has  been conditioned to this view.  

![](images/f7308323410adeb71611799cbd0e99536754d2f168b7a88d20de60b5f6dee868.jpg)  

3.	 Different color tints show bands of elevation relative to sea level. These colors range from light green  for the lower elevations, to dark brown for the higher elevations.  

4.	 Obstruction symbols show man made vertical features that could affect safe navigation. The FAA  maintains a database of obstacles. Aeronautical Specialists evaluate each obstacle based on chart- ing specifications before adding it to a a visual chart. When a Specialist is not able   to verify the position or elevation of an obstacle, it is marked UC, meaning it is "under construction"   or being reported, but has not been verified.  

The FAA uses a Digital Obstacle File (DOF) to collect and disseminate data. Because land and obstructions  frequently change, the source data on obstructions and terrain is occasionally incomplete or not accurate  enough for use in aeronautical publications. For example, when the FAA receives notification about an ob- struction, and there is insufficient detail to determine its position and elevation, the FAA Flight Edit Program  conducts an investigation.  

The Flight Edit crew visually verifies the cultural, topographic, and obstacle data. Charts are generally flight- checked every four years. This review includes checking for any obstruction that has been recently built,  altered, or dismantled without proper notification.  

![](images/f0bd028d4f6a95f34954d17fd794b4d71fb1fdface04dc6fa850dc391b7d5930.jpg)  

Sectional Charts and Terminal Area (TACs) typically show man-made obstacles  extending more than 200' Above Ground Level (AGL), or more than 299' AGL in yellow  city tint. Obstacles may be lit or unlit. Features considered to be hazardous obstacles  to low-level flight are; smokestacks, tanks, factories, lookout towers, antennas, and  wind turbines, etc.  

Man-made features used by FAA Air Traffic Control as checkpoints use a graphic symbol shown in black  with the required elevation data in blue. The elevation of the top of the obstacle above Mean Sea Level  (MSL) and the height of the structure (AGL) is also indicated (when known or can be reliably determined by  a Specialist). The AGL height is in parentheses below the MSL elevation. In extremely congested areas, the  FAA typically omits the AGL values to avoid confusion.  

#  

#  

Whenever possible, the FAA depicts specific obstacles on charts. However, in high-density areas  like city complexes, only the highest obstacle is represented on the chart using the group obstacle  symbol to maximize legibility.  

Group Obstacle Symbol  

#  

Obstacles under construction are indicated by placing the letters UC adjacent to the obstacle type.  

If space is available the AGL  height of the obstruction is  shown in parentheses.  

Guy wires may  extend outward  from obstacles.  

Obstacles with high-intensity strobe lighting systems may operate part-time or by proximity  activation and are shown as follows:  

# Wind turbines  with high intensity  lighting.  

Concentrated obstructions of wind turbine farms shall be portrayed by an overlying hatched area and  dotted outline to represent the approximate parameters of the farm. One or more single turbine  symbols will populate the farm. A boxed elevation figure representing the MSL elevation of the highest  wind turbine within the area shall be placed inside the farm or, if space is limited, just outside. Pilots  are reminded that wind turbine blades and/or blade tips are not lighted. Wind turbine obstruction  lights are located on top of the nacelle (generator) at the hub of wind turbines, which in some cases  can be 200-300’ below the rotating blade tips.  

# 2894  UC  

5.	 The Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) represents the highest elevation within a quadrant,   including terrain and other vertical obstacles (towers, trees, etc.). A quadrant on Sectionals  is the area bounded by ticked lines dividing each 30 minutes of latitude and each 30  minutes of longitude. MEF figures are rounded up to the nearest 100' value and the last  two digits of the number are not shown.  

MEFs over land and open water areas are used in areas containing man-made obstacles such as oil rigs.  

In the determination of MEFs, the FAA uses extreme care to calculate the values based on the existing elevation data  shown on source material. Aeronautical Information Specialists use the following procedure to calculate MEFs:  

# MEF - Man-made Obstacle  

When a man-made obstacle is more than 200' above the highest terrain within the quadrant:  

1.	 Determine the elevation of the top of the obstacle above MSL.  2.	 Add the possible vertical error of the source material to the above figure (  $100'$   or   $_{1/2}$   contour interval when inter- val on source exceeds 200’. U.S. Geological Survey Quadrangle Maps with contour intervals as small as  $\uparrow0'$   are  normally used).  3.	 Round the resultant figure up to the next higher hundred-foot level.  

![](images/aaab01dc80e4d781347a48063dd30a66ffcd1e2941229d8a767247e9fdeeb578.jpg)  

![](images/83e099734aedf4d35cd22c4f4f05bdf04fb9cf3a83b7296db780abd527c93b43.jpg)  

# MEF - Natural Terrain Feature or Natural Vertical Obstacle  

When a natural terrain feature or natural vertical obstacle (e.g. a tree) is the highest feature within the quadrangle:  

1.	 Determine the elevation of the feature.  

2.	 Add the possible vertical error of the source to the above figure ( source exceeds 200’). 

 3.	 Add a  $_{200},$   allowance for uncharted natural or  manmade obstacles. Chart specifications don’t  require the portrayal of obstacles below minimum  height. 

 4.	 Round the figure up to the next higher hundred- foot level.

Pilots should be aware that while the MEF is based on the best information available to the Specialist, the figures are not  verified by field surveys. Also, users should consult the Aeronautical Information Services website to ensure that your  chart has the latest MEF data available.  

# LAND FEATURES - MOUNTAIN PASSES  

The Mountain Pass symbol   does not indicate  a recommended route or direction of flight, and pass  elevation does not indicate a recommended clearance  altitude. Hazardous flight conditions may exist within  and near mountain passes. For high-traffic mountain  passes, VFR Checkpoints may be provided to increase  situational awareness by indicating key landmarks inside  confined terrain. A collocated VFR Waypoint and Check- point may be provided to assist with identifying natural  entry points for commonly flown mountain passes.  

![](images/1b957367b38aa9af8af881798f4f558f3e3b8c70b7c1a18f14c0d089fc8dd432.jpg)  

# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION  

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is  same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation  (TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no  misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be  indicated only once within the identification box. Very High  Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names  and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only  

![](images/2624acff0763a76ceb088dce925d53c5672d86cd42685a3f41d20e775331306c.jpg)  

those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of  separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio  aids.  

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a  typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when  collocated with an airport icon.  

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range)  "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring  Equipment) or “DME” (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking  the top line of the NAVAID box.  

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.  

# AIRPORTS  

![](images/d761085e03cfd2bd8f1e8cbd9358c75038dd42af51af252468d258b949c0eebc.jpg)  

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section). Public use airports:  

![](images/a449446fd5b99c5d7125516f866794bc9c6f6d90f3d5a375ca42f175d1bbaadc.jpg)  

Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069’ or some multiple runways less than 8069’  

Hard-surfaced runways 1500’ to 8069’  

Other than hard-surfaced runways

       Seaplane bases  

Military airports:  

Other than hard-surfaced runways Foreign airports:  

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.  

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as AAF (Army Air Field), AFB (Air Force Base), MCAS (Marine  Corps Air Station), NAS (Naval Air Station), NAV (Naval Air Facility), and NAAS (Naval Auxiliary Air Station).  

Fuel Available:  

Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for  details and availability.  

#  

Airports are plotted in their true geographic position unless the symbol conflicts with a NAVAID at the same location. In  such cases, the airport symbol will be displaced, but the relationship between the airport and the NAVAID will be retained.  When a waypoint is collocated with a towered airport, the waypoint symbol will not be charted and the waypoint name  followed by (WP) will be shown leadered to the waypoint true location. When depicting a seaplane base, the eye of the  anchor symbol will be charted as close to the docking area as possible, with the remainder of the symbol in the water.  

Airports are identified by their official FAA designated name.  

The elevation of an airport is the highest point on the usable portion of the landing areas.  Runway length is the length of the longest active runway, including displaced thresholds  and excluding overruns. Runway length is shown to the nearest   $100^{\circ}$  , using 70 as the  rounding point; a runway 8070' in length is charted as 81, while a runway  $8069^{\prime}$   in length is  charted as 80. If an airport has waterways, it will be indicated by a seaplane base symbol  and additional elevation, lighting, and length information under primary airport information.  

![](images/683269c45be313ce324104077ec6f1e9edfc38fce4115ce77ea0044aca4831de.jpg)

Airports with Control Towers (CT) and their related data are shown in blue. All other airports and their related data are  shown in magenta. The  $\mathbb{L}$   symbol indicates that runway lights are on from dusk to dawn.  $^{\ast\mathbb{L}}$   indicates that the pilot must  consult the Chart Supplement to determine runway lighting limitations, such as: available on request (by radio-call, letter,  phone, etc), part-time lighting, or pilot/airport controlled lighting. Lighting codes refer to runway edge lights. The lighted  runway may not be the longest runway available, and lights may not be illuminated along the full length of the runway. The  Chart Supplement has a detailed description of airport and air navigation lighting aids for each airport. A dash represents  no runway edge lights.  

The symbol    indicates the existence of a rotating or flashing airport beacon operating from dusk to dawn. The Aeronau- tical Information Manual (AIM) thoroughly explains the types and uses of airport lighting aids.  

Right traffic information is shown using the abbreviation 'RP' for right pattern, followed by the appropriate runway  number(s) (RP 18). Special conditions or restrictions to the right pattern are indicated by the use of an asterisk   $(^{\star}{\sf R P})$   to  direct the pilot to the Chart Supplement for special instructions and/or restrictions.  

The type “OBJECTIONABLE” associated with an airport symbol indicates that an objectionable airspace determination  has been made for the airport per FAA JO 7400.2 Section 4, Airport Charting and Publication of Airport Data. Objection- able airspace determinations are based upon a number of factors including conflicting traffic patterns with another airport,  hazardous runway conditions, or natural or man-made obstacles in close proximity to the landing area. FAA Regional  Airports Offices are responsible for airspace determinations. Address any challenges to objectionable airspace determina- tions to your FAA Regional Airports Office.  

# AIRSPACE  

# CONTROLLED AIRSPACE  

Controlled airspace consists of those areas where some or all aircraft may be subject to air traffic control, such as: Class  A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E Surface (SFC) and Class E Airspace.  

Class A Airspace  within the United States extends from 18,000' up to FL600. While visual charts do not depict Class A, it  is important to note its existence.  

Class B Airspace  is shown on the Sectional Aeronautical Chart (Sectional) and Terminal Area Chart (TAC).   The MSL ceiling and floor altitudes of each sector are shown in solid blue figures with the last two zeros  omitted. Floors extending "upward from above" a certain altitude are preceded by a   $(+)$  . Operations at and below these  altitudes are outside of Class B Airspace. Radials and arcs used to define Class B are prominently shown on TACs.  Detailed rules and requirements associated with the particular Class B are shown. The name by which the Class B is  shown as   for example.  

Class C Airspace  is shown on Sectionals and TACs. The MSL ceiling and floor altitudes of each sector are   shown in solid magenta figures with the last two zeros eliminated.  

A ceiling value of “T” indicates the ceiling is to, but not including, the floor of the overlying Class B airspace.  Surface.  

Class C Airspace is identified by name:  

Separate notes, enclosed in magenta boxes, give the approach control frequencies to be used by arriving VFR aircraft to  establish two-way radio communication before entering the Class C (generally within 20 NM):  

Class C operating less than continuous is indicated by the following note:  

Class D Airspace  is identified with a blue dashed line. Class D operating less than continuous is indicated by the follow- ing note:  

Ceilings of Class D are shown as follows:  

A minus in front of the figure is used to indicate "from surface to, but not including..."  

Class E Surface (SFC) Airspace  is symbolized with a magenta dashed line. Class E (SFC) operating less than continu- ous is indicated by the following note:  

Class E Airspace  exists at 1200' AGL unless designated otherwise. The lateral and vertical  vertical limits of all Class E, (up to, but not including 18,000') are shown by narrow bands of  vignette on Sectionals and TACs.  

Controlled airspace floors of 700' above the ground are defined by a magenta vignette;  floors other than  $700^{\circ}$   that laterally abut uncontrolled airspace (Class G) are defined by a  blue vignette; differing floors greater than 700' above the ground are annotated by a symbol  and a number indicating the floor.  

![](images/4bf54e9dca1a2d4be1ecb4a2f02e6d4229fc24d3f498200b6967f1de1a67d3ec.jpg)

If the ceiling is less than 18,000' MSL, the value (preceded by the word "ceiling") is shown along the limits of the controlled  airspace. These limits are shown with the same symbol indicated above.  

# UNCONTROLLED AIRSPACE  

Class G Airspace  within the United States extends up to 14,500' Mean Sea Level. At and above this altitude is Class E,  excluding the airspace less than 1500' above the terrain and certain special use airspace areas.  

# SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE  

Special Use Airspace (SUA)  confines certain flight activities and restricts  entry, or cautions other aircraft operating within specific boundaries. Except  for Controlled Firing Areas, SUA areas are depicted on VFR Charts. Con- trolled Firing Areas are not charted because their activities are suspended  immediately when spotter aircraft, radar, or ground lookout positions indi- cate an aircraft might be approaching the area. Non participating aircraft  are not required to change their flight paths. SUA areas are shown in their  

![](images/4bc6dd1b1b7629c3a019c2c8fc5b09f3d40ae3c3ecd9d0a412bb062a854dc936.jpg)  

entirety (within the limits of the chart), even when they overlap, adjoin, or when an area is designated within another area.  The areas are identified by type and identifying name/number, and are positioned either within or immediately adjacent to  the area.  

\* Alert Areas do not extend into Class A, B, C and D airspace, or Class E airport surface areas.  

# OTHER AIRSPACE AREAS  

Mode C Required Airspace  (from the surface to 10,000' MSL) within a 30 NM radius of the primary airport(s) for which a  Class B is designated, is depicted by a solid magenta line. M O D E   C   &   A D S - B   O U T  

Mode C is required, but not depicted for operations within and above all Class C up to 10,000' MSL.  

Enroute Mode C requirements (at and above 10,000' MSL except in airspace at and below 2500' AGL) are not depicted.  See FAR 91.215 and the AIM.  

FAR 93  Airports and heliports under Federal Aviation Regulation 93 (FAR 93), (Special Air Traffic  Rules and Airport Traffic Patterns), are shown by "boxing" the airport name.

National Security Areas  indicated with a broken magenta line   and Special Flight Rules Areas (SFRAs) in- dicated with the following symbol:  , consist of airspace with defined vertical and lateral dimensions estab- lished at locations where there is a requirement for increased security and safety of ground facilities. Pilots should avoid  flying through these depicted areas. When necessary, flight may be temporarily prohibited.  

The Washington DC Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ)  is related to National Security. It is depicted using the Prohibited/ Restricted/Warning Area symbology   and is located within the SFRA. It is defined as the airspace within  approximately a 13 to 15 NM radius of the DCA VOR-DME. Additional requirements are levied upon aviators requesting  access to operate inside the National Capital Region.  

Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) Areas Relating to National Security  are indicated with a broken blue line  . A Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is a type of Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM). A TFR defines an area  where air travel is restricted due to a hazardous condition, a special event, or a general warning for the entire airspace.  The text of the actual TFR contains the fine points of the restriction. It is important to note that only TFRs relating to Na- tional Security are charted.  

Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZs)  are symbolized using the ADIZ symbol:  . As defined in Code of  Federal Regulations 14 (CFR 14) Part 99, an ADIZ is an area in which the ready identification, location, and control of all  aircraft is required in the interest of national security. ADIZ boundaries include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the Contiguous  U.S.  

# National Defense Airspace Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) Areas  are bounded with cross hatching:  

. These areas include airspace that is subject to routine TFRs published as NOTAMs that have a   $^{12+}$    month duration.  

Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSAs)  are shown in their entirety, symbolized by a screened black outline of the entire  area including the various sectors within the area  .  

The outer limit of the entire Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA) is a continuous screened black line. The various sec- tors within the TRSA are symbolized by narrower screened black lines.  

Each sector altitude is identified in solid black color by the MSL ceiling and floor values of the respective sector, elimi- nating the last two zeros. A leader line is used when the altitude values must be positioned outside the respective sec- tors because of charting space limitations. The TRSA name is shown near the north position of the TRSA as follows:  . Associated frequencies are listed in a table on the chart border.  

Military Training Routes (MTRs)  are shown on Sectionals and TACs. They are identified by the route designator:   . Route designators are shown in solid black on the route centerline, positioned along the route for  continuity. The designator IR or VR is not repeated when two or more routes are established over the same airspace, e.g.,  IR201-205-227. Routes numbered 001 to 099 are shown as IR1 or VR99, eliminating the initial zeros. Direction of flight  along the route is indicated by small arrowheads adjacent to and in conjunction with each route designator.  

The following note appears on Helicopters, Sectionals and TACs except for Hawaiian Islands, which is different.  

![](images/44243611e4db8b4752360e5c344fe9534a2a419f96b35f95910ee2e95a5bdd1e.jpg)  

# There are IFR (IR) and VFR (VR) routes as follows:  

# Route identification:  

a. MTRs with no segment above 1500' are identified by four-digit numbers; e.g., VR1007, etc. These routes are  generally developed to be flown under Visual Flight Rules.  

b. MTRs that include one or more segments above 1500' AGL are identified by three or fewer digit numbers; e.g.,  IR21, etc. These routes are developed to be flown, to the maximum extent possible under Instrument Flight Rules.  

Route width varies for each MTR and can extend several miles on either side of the charted MTR centerline. Detailed  route width information is available in the Flight Information Publication (FLIP) AP/1B (a Department of Defense publica- tion), or through the 56 Day NASR Subscription from the National Flight Data Center (NFDC).  

Special Military Activity  areas are indicated on Sectionals by an underlying IFR Military Training Route with the lateral  limits of the route shown by a gray Special Use Airspace symbol. A boxed note accompanies the area. The note contains  radio frequency and route identifier information to use for obtaining area activity status.

The following guidance appears in the margin of applicable Sectional Charts.  

SPECIAL MILITARY ACTIVITY The chart identifies IFR Military Training Routes and Military Operations Area within which the Department of Defense  conducts periodic operations involving Unmanned Aircraft Systems. These aircraft may be accompanied by military or  other aircraft which provide the pilots of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems visual observation information about other  aircraft operations near them. Status of these routes and areas may be obtained by contacting the FAA/DoD facility on designated frequencies along the IFR route, referencing the identifier, e.g., IR214 as depicted on this chart. The lateral  limits of these specified routes are shown by the Special Use Airspace symbol. Altitudes for these route segments are  also shown.

# FOREIGN AREAS  

The data depicted in areas outside the U.S. is skeletonized on all VFR aeronautical charts. Only major airports, NAVAIDs,  and airways are charted in foreign areas in screened black. Cultural features, hydrographic information and geographic  relief are depicted in subdued and different shades of gray. A note regarding the expectation of the use of foreign charts  and flight information publications is depicted along the boundary.

# VFR FLYWAY PLANNING CHARTS  

# GENERAL INFORMATION  

VFR Flyway Planning Charts  are printed on the reverse sides of the Baltimore-Washington, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincin- nati, Dallas-Ft. Worth, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, New Orleans, Phoenix, St. Lou- is, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, and Tampa Terminal Area Charts (TACs). The scale is 1:250,000,  with area of coverage the same as the associated TACs. Flyway Planning Charts depict flight paths and altitudes recom- mended for use to by-pass areas heavily traversed by large turbine-powered aircraft. Ground references on these charts  provide a guide for visual orientation. VFR Flyway Planning charts are designed for use in conjunction with TACs and are  not to be used for navigation. These charts are updated every 56 days.  

# AIRPORTS  

# Landplane  

No distinction is made      	 	 between airports with fuel and   those without fuel. Runways   may be exaggerated to clearly  portray the pattern. Hard- surfaced runways that are  closed but still exist are	 included in the charted pattern.  

FAR 91 - Fixed wing special  VFR operations prohibited.  

(Pvt): Non-public use having            

  landmark value.  

“OBJECTIONABLE”: This 	               airport may adversely affect  airspace use.

# CARIBBEAN VFR AERONAUTICAL CHARTS (CAC)  

The Caribbean Charts are published as two VFR Charts:  Caribbean 1 (CAC-1) covers Southern Florida, Cuba,  Haiti and the Bahamas; Caribbean 2 (CAC-2) covers  Puerto Rico, Haiti, Dominican Republic, the Lesser  Antilles and Leeward Islands. Charts are updated every  56-day chart cycle.  

![](images/dd90ed71dfa7a993e471436417bf098a30a6562d5f9eecef463490991c487d6a.jpg)  

Caribbean Charts are designed for VFR flights and  provide aeronautical and topographic information of the  Caribbean. The aeronautical information includes  airports, radio aids to navigation, Class airspace and  special use airspace in U.S. and major airports, and  radio aids to navigation in foreign areas. The topographic  information includes city tint, populated places, principal  roads, drainage patterns and shaded relief.  

![](images/7ada12886df314d5449a53e0a5a5bd99cfd33395be262c7abffd342c898ee74e.jpg)  

The chart symbols used on the  Caribbean Charts are similar to  those used in the Sectional and  Terminal Area Charts, the major  difference being in scale. The  Caribbean VFR Chart scale is  1:1,000,000 versus the Sectional  Chart Scale of 1:500,000 and  Terminal Area Chart Scale of  1:250,000. Chart symbology will  appear smaller on the Caribbean  VFR Charts.

Excerpt from Detroit Sectional Chart  

# EXPLANATION OF IFR ENROUTE TERMS  

FAA charts are prepared in accordance with specifications of the Interagency Air Committee (IAC), and are approved by  representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Defense (DoD). Some information on these  charts may only apply to military pilots.  

The explanations of symbols used on Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) Enroute Charts and examples in this section are based  primarily on the IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts. Other IFR products use similar symbols in various colors. The chart leg- ends portray aeronautical symbols with a brief description of what each symbol depicts. This section provides more details  of the symbols and how they are used on IFR Enroute charts.  

# AIRPORTS  

Operational airports are shown on IFR Enroute Charts.  

Low Charts:  

•	 All IAP Airports are shown on the Low Altitude Charts (US and Alaska).  •	 Non-IAP Airports are shown on the U.S. Low Altitude Charts (Contiguous US) have a minimum hard surface  runway of 3,000’.  •	 Non-IAP airports are shown on the U.S. Low Altitude Alaska Charts are show if the runway is  $3000^{\circ}$   or longer,  hard or soft surface.  •	 Public heliports with an Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) or requested by the FAA or DoD are depicted on  the IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts.  •	 Seaplane bases requested by the FAA or DoD are depicted on the IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts.  

On IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts, airport tabulation is provided that identifies airport names, IDs and the panels they  are located on.  

High Charts:  

•	 Airports shown on the U.S. High Enroute Charts (Contiguous US) have a minimum hard surface runway of 5000’.  •	 Airports shown on the U.S. High Enroute Alaska Charts have a minimum hard surface runway of 4000’.  

Charted airports are classified according to the following criteria:  

![](images/ac9c66885094043cb7e6805384cdf574043ab8e8ae1076db6eb12a6c6ea6ab2a.jpg)  

Blue  - Airports with an Instrument Approach Procedure and/or RADAR MINIMA published in the high altitude DoD  Flight Information Publications (FLIPs)  

Green  - Airports that have an approved Instrument Approach Procedure and/or RADAR MINIMA published in  either the U.S. Terminal Procedures Publications (TPPs) or the DoD FLIPs  

Brown  - Airports without a published Instrument Approach Procedure or RADAR MINIMA  

Black  - Foreign airports  

Airports are plotted at their true geographic position.  

Airports are identified by the airport name. In the case of military airports, Air Force Base (AFB), Naval Air Station (NAS),  Naval Air Facility (NAF), Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS), Army Air Field (AAF), etc., the abbreviated letters appear as  part of the airport name.  

Airports marked "Pvt" immediately following the airport name are not for public use, but otherwise meet the criteria for  charting as specified above.  

Runway length is the length of the longest active runway (including displaced thresholds but excluding overruns) and is  shown to the nearest 100 feet using 70 feet as the division point; e.g., a runway of 8,070' is labeled 81. The following run- way compositions (materials) constitute a hard-surfaced runway: asphalt, bitumen, chip seal, concrete, and tar macadam.  Runways that are not hard-surfaced have a small letter "s" following the runway length, indicating a soft surface.  

![](images/65f43f8a5b7302ff1f1335c5859cd956b5718065228f6b292a3a677805edd09a.jpg)  

A   symbol between the airport elevation and runway length means that runway lights are in operation sunset to sunrise.  A  $\textcircled{\scriptsize{1}}$   symbol indicates there is Pilot Controlled Lighting. A   $\mathsf{A L}^{\star}$   symbol means the lighting is part-time or on request, the  pilot should consult the Chart Supplement for light operating procedures. The Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) thor- oughly explains the types and uses of airport lighting aids.

MON Airports with the           Airport designator at the top of the Airport Data Block. The MON designation is to alert pilots  to those airports that have retained ILS and VOR instrument approach procedures for safe recovery in the event of a GPS  outage. Refer to the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) for expanded MON Airport guidance.  

# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION  

All IFR radio NAVAIDs that have been flight checked and are operational are shown on all IFR Enroute Charts. Very High  Frequency/Ultrahigh Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAIDs, Very high frequency Omnidirectional Radio range (VORs), Tactical  Air Navigation (TACANs) are shown in black, and Low Frequency/Medium Frequency (LF/MF) NAVAIDs, (Compass Loca- tors and Aeronautical or Marine NDBs) are shown in brown.  

On IFR Enroute Charts, information about NAVAIDs is boxed as illustrated below. To avoid duplication of data, when two  or more NAVAIDs in a general area have the same name, the name is usually printed only once inside an identification  box with the frequencies, TACAN channel numbers, identification letters, or Morse Code Identifications of the different  NAVAIDs are shown in appropriate colors.  

NAVAIDs in a shutdown status have the frequency and channel number crosshatched. Use of the NAVAID status "shut- down" is only used when a facility has been decommissioned but cannot be published as such because of pending  airspace actions.

![Notes:  For NAVAIDs with two SSVs, the SSV for each component is shown in paired parentheses with the VOR SSV  shown first followed by the DME or TACAN SSV. Additionally, High Altitude facilities provide Low Altitude and Terminal  service volume and Low Altitude facilities provide Terminal service volume. Altitudes are with respect to the station’s  site elevation. Coverage is not available in a cone of airspace directly above the facility. In some cases local conditions  (terrain, buildings, trees, etc.) may require that the service volume be restricted. The public shall be informed of any  such restriction by a remark in the NAVAID entry or by a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM).  ](images/cf918f6fe56d001ce40984a2a4bcc2946b03140e18d7e2ac06358d768ccaa7a2.jpg)  

# AIRSPACE INFORMATION  

# CONTROLLED AIRSPACE  

Controlled airspace consists of those areas where some or all aircraft are subjected to air traffic control within the follow- ing airspace classifications of A, B, C, D, & E.  

Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) are established to provide Air Traffic Control to aircraft operating on IFR flight  plans within controlled airspace, particularly during the enroute phase of flight. Boundaries of the ARTCCs are shown in  their entirety using the symbol below.  

![](images/aa00a04e189fa85e7a2e3b6217b01cee31442ab0967d9c5b7c1bef5a25048740.jpg)  

When Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC) exists for an ARTCC, the text CPDLC (LOGON KUSA) will be  Site Name shown parallel to the boundary above or below the ARTCC identification as shown below.

Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) with  The responsible ARTCC Center names are shown adjacent and parallel to the boundary line. ARTCC sector frequencies  are shown in boxes outlined by the same symbol.  

![](images/4a242dc7beaee114a8020d5e4c6b699e9318211231c6b02a5148d7167ce9aeb7.jpg)  

Class A  Airspace is depicted as open area (white) on the IFR Enroute High Altitude Charts. It consists of  airspace from 18,000 Mean Sea Level (MSL) to FL600.  

Class B  Airspace is depicted as screened blue area with a solid line encompassing the area.  

Class C  Airspace is depicted as screened blue area with a dashed line encompassing the area with a let- ter “C” enclosed in a box following the airport name.  

Class B and Class C Airspace consist of controlled airspace extending upward from the surface or a des- ignated floor to specified altitudes, within which all aircraft and pilots are subject to the operating rules and  requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations (UHF) 71. Class B and C Airspace are shown  in abbreviated forms on IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts. A general note adjacent to Class B airspace  refers the user to the appropriate VFR Terminal Area Chart.  

Class D  Airspace (airports with an operating control tower) are depicted as open area (white) with a letter  “D” enclosed in a box following the airport name.  

Class E  Airspace is depicted as open area (white) on the IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts. It consists of  airspace below FL180.  

# UNCONTROLLED AIRSPACE  

Class G  Airspace within the United States extends to 14,500’ MSL. This uncontrolled airspace is shown  as screened brown.  

# SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE  

Special Use Airspace (SUA) confines certain flight activities, restricts entry, or cautions other aircraft operating within  specific boundaries. SUA areas are shown in their entirety, even when they overlap, adjoin, or when an area is designated  within another area. SUA with altitudes from the surface and above are shown on the IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts.  Similarly, SUA that extends above 18,000' MSL are shown on IFR Enroute High Altitude Charts. IFR Enroute Charts  tabulations identify the type of SUA, ID, effective altitudes, times of use, controlling agency and the panel it is located on.  

Users need to be aware that a NOTAM addressing activation will NOT be issued to announce permanently listed times of  use.

Mode C Required Airspace  (from the surface to 10,000' MSL) within 30 NM radius of the primary airport(s) for which a  Class B airspace is designated, is depicted on IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts as a blue circle labeled MODE C & ADS-B  OUT 30 NM.  

Mode C & ADS-B Out is also required for operations within and above all Class C airspace up to 10,000' MSL, but not  depicted. See FAR 91.215 and the AIM.  

# INSTRUMENT AIRWAYS  

The FAA has established two fixed route systems for air navigation. The VOR and LF/MF system-designated from 1,200'  Above Ground Level (AGL) to but not including FL 180 is shown on IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts, and the Jet Route  system designated from FL 180 to FL 450 inclusive is shown on IFR Enroute High Altitude Charts.  

# VOR LF/MF AIRWAY SYSTEM (IFR LOW ALTITUDE ENROUTE CHARTS)  

In this system VOR airways - airways based on VOR or VORTAC NAVAIDs - are depicted in black and identified by a "V"  (Victor) followed by the route number (e.g., "V12").  

LF/MF airways - airways based on LF/MF NAVAIDs - are sometimes called "colored airways" because they are identified  by color name and number (e.g., "Amber One", charted as "A1"). In Alaska, Green and Red airways are plotted east and  

west, and Amber and Blue airways are plotted north and south. Regardless of their color identifier, LF/MF airways are  shown in brown.  

# AIRWAY/ROUTE DATA  

On both series of IFR Enroute Charts, airway/route data such as the airway identifications, magnetic courses bearings or  radials, mileages, and altitudes (e.g., Minimum Enroute Altitudes (MEAs), Minimum Reception Altitudes (MRAs), Maxi- mum Authorized Altitudes (MAAs), Minimum Obstacle Clearance Altitudes (MOCAs), Minimum Turning Altitudes (MTAs)  and Minimum Crossing Altitudes (MCAs)) are shown aligned with the airway.  

As a rule the airway/route data is charted and in the same color as the airway, with one exception. Charted in blue, Global  Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) MEAs, identified with a "G" suffix, have been added to "V" and "colored airways" for  aircraft flying those airways using Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation.  

Airways/Routes predicated on VOR or VORTAC NAVAIDs are defined by the outbound radial from the NAVAID. Airways/ Routes predicated on LF/MF NAVAIDs are defined by the inbound bearing.  

•	 Minimum Enroute Altitude (MEA)  - The MEA is the lowest published altitude between radio fixes that assures  acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstacle clearance requirements between those fixes. The  MEA prescribed for a Federal airway or segment, RNAV low or high route, or other direct route applies to the en- tire width of the airway, segment, or route between the radio fixes defining the airway, segment, or route. MEAs for  routes wholly contained within controlled airspace normally provide a buffer above the floor of controlled airspace  consisting of at least 300 feet within transition areas and 500 feet within control areas. MEAs are established  based upon obstacle clearance over terrain and man-made objects, adequacy of navigation facility performance,  and communications requirements.  

•	 Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA)  - MRAs are determined by FAA flight inspection traversing an entire route  of flight to establish the minimum altitude the navigation signal can be received for the route and for off-course  NAVAID facilities that determine a fix. When the MRA at the fix is higher than the MEA, an MRA is established for  the fix and is the lowest altitude at which an intersection can be determined.  

•	 Maximum Authorized Altitude (MAA)  - An MAA is a published altitude representing the maximum usable  altitude or flight level for an airspace structure or route segment. It is the highest altitude on a Federal airway, jet  route, RNAV low or high route, or other direct route for which an MEA is designated at which adequate reception  of navigation signals is assured.  

•	 Minimum Obstruction Clearance Altitude (MOCA)  - The MOCA is the lowest published altitude in effect be- tween radio fixes on VOR airways, off-airway routes, or route segments that meets obstacle clearance require- ments for the entire route segment and assures acceptable navigational signal coverage only within 25 statute (22  nautical) miles of a VOR. A MOCA is only shown on the Enroute Low Charts and only published when it is lower  than the MEA. When shown, it is preceded by an asterisk.  

•	 Minimum Turning Altitude (MTA)  - Minimum turning altitude (MTA) is a charted altitude providing vertical and  lateral obstruction clearance based on turn criteria over certain fixes, NAVAIDs, waypoints, and on charted route  segments. When a VHF airway or route terminates at a NAVAID or fix, the primary area extends beyond that  termination point. When a change of course on VHF airways and routes is necessary, the enroute obstacle clear- ance turning area extends the primary and secondary obstacle clearance areas to accommodate the turn radius  of the aircraft. Since turns at or after fix passage may exceed airway and route boundaries, pilots are expected to  adhere to airway and route protected airspace by leading turns early before a fix. The turn area provides obstacle  clearance for both turn anticipation (turning prior to the fix) and flyover protection (turning after crossing the fix).  Turning fixes requiring a higher MTA are charted with a flag along with accompanying text describing the MTA  restriction.  

•	 Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA)  - An MCA is the lowest altitude at certain fixes at which the aircraft must  cross when proceeding in the direction of a higher minimum enroute IFR altitude. MCAs are established in all  cases where obstacles intervene to prevent pilots from maintaining obstacle clearance during a normal climb to a  higher MEA after passing a point beyond which the higher MEA applies. The same protected enroute area vertical  obstacle clearance requirements for the primary and secondary areas are considered in the determination of the  MCA.

# AREA NAVIGATION (RNAV) "T" ROUTE SYSTEM  

The FAA has created new low altitude area navigation (RNAV) "T" routes for the enroute and terminal environments. The  RNAV routes will provide more direct routing for IFR aircraft and enhance the safety and efficiency of the National Air- space System. To utilize these routes aircraft are required to be equipped with IFR approved GNSS. In Alaska, TSO-145a  and 146a equipment is required.  

Low altitude RNAV only routes are identified by the prefix "T", and the prefix "TK" for RNAV helicopter routes followed by a  three digit number (T-200 to T-500). Routes are depicted in blue on the IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts. RNAV route data  (route line, identification boxes, mileages, waypoints, waypoint names, magnetic reference courses and MEAs) will also  be printed in blue. Magnetic reference courses will be shown originating from a waypoint, fix/reporting point or NAVAID.  GNSS MEA for each segment is established to ensure obstacle clearance and communications reception. GNSS MEAs  are identified with a "G" suffix.

Joint Victor/RNAV routes are charted as outlined above except as noted. The joint Victor route and the RNAV route iden- tification boxes are shown adjacent to each other. Magnetic reference courses are not shown. MEAs are charted above  the appropriate identification box or stacked in pairs, GNSS and Victor. On joint routes, RNAV specific information will be  printed in blue.

# UNUSABLE AIRWAY/ROUTE SEGMENTS  

Airway/Route segments designated by the FAA as unusable will be depicted as shown below.  

![](images/5dc6a0e61d4b3fda7ea365b6042e47b92300e079aec7285a42034346bc314923.jpg)  

Pilots should not file a flight plan for or accept a clearance that includes navigation on any route or route segment depict- ed as unusable. Pilots using RNAV may request ATC clearance to fly point-to-point between valid waypoints or fixes, even  those on routes depicted as unusable (refer to AC 90-108 for RNAV eligibility).  

# Coincident Airways/Routes with Unusable Segment  

When two airways/routes are coincident, but only one airway/route is designated as unusable, the following note indicat- ing which airway the unusable symbology applies to will be placed in close proximity to the airway/route identifiers.  

![](images/7427bc0ea1585539d3386680219d794973047c6344aaf173668b6609acfdfa59.jpg)  

# OFF ROUTE OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE ALTITUDE (OROCA)  

The Off Route Obstruction Clearance Altitude (OROCA) is depicted on IFR Enroute Low Altitude and Pacific charts and  is represented in thousands and hundreds of feet above MSL. OROCAs are shown in every  $30\times30$   minute quadrant on  Area Charts, every one degree by one degree quadrant for IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts - U.S. and every two de¬gree  by two degree quadrant on IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts - Alaska. The OROCA is based on the highest known terrain  feature or obstruction in each quadrangle, bounded by the ticked lines of latitude/longitude including data 4 NM outside  the quadrant. In this example the OROCA represents 12,500 feet.  

OROCA is computed just as the Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) found on Visual Flight Rule (VFR) Charts except that it  provides an additional vertical buffer of 1,000 feet in designated non-mountainous areas and a 2,000 foot vertical buffer in  designated mountainous areas within the United States. Evaluating the area around the quadrant provides the chart user  the same lateral clearance an airway provides should the line of intended flight follow a ticked line of latitude or longitude.  OROCA altitudes are not assessed for NAVAID signal coverage, air traffic control surveillance, or communications cover- age, and are published for general situational awareness, flight planning, and in-flight contingency use. OROCAs can be  found over all land masses and open water areas containing man-made obstructions (such as oil rigs).  

# MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES (MTRs)  

Military Training Routes (MTRs) are routes established for the conduct of low-altitude, high-speed military flight training  (generally below 10,000 feet MSL at airspeeds in excess of 250 knots Indicated Air Speed). These routes are depicted in  brown on IFR Enroute Low Altitude Charts, and are not shown on inset charts or on IFR Enroute High Altitude Charts. IFR  Enroute Low Altitude Charts depict all IFR Military Training Routes (IRs) and VFR Military Training Routes (VRs), except  those VRs that are entirely at or below 1,500 feet AGL.  

MTRs are identified by designators (IR-107, VR-134) that are shown in brown on the route centerline. Arrows are shown  to indicate the direction of flight along the route. The width of the route determines the width of the line that is plotted on  the chart:  

Route segments with a width of 5 NM or less, both sides of the centerline, are shown by a .02" line.  

![](images/77c485be5d7419b255063da5af5e5ac8c6f8140fa908c78d32e72623253a8414.jpg)  

Route segments with a width greater than 5 NM, either or both sides of the centerline, are shown by a .035" line.  

![](images/76c6281141bc8648599ce0596f858885cf98c7a88bc10d2bf9d34631a3a11f5e.jpg)  

MTRs for particular chart pairs (ex. L1/2, etc.) are alphabetically, then numerically tabulated. The tabulation includes MTR  type and unique identification and altitude range.  

# JET ROUTE SYSTEM (HIGH ALTITUDE ENROUTE CHARTS)  

Jet routes are based on VOR or VORTAC NAVAIDs, and are depicted in black with a "J" identifier followed by the route  number (e.g., "J12"). In Alaska, Russia and Canada some segments of jet routes are based on LF/MF NAVAIDs.  

# AREA NAVIGATION (RNAV) "Q" ROUTE SYSTEM (IFR ENROUTE HIGH ALTITUDE CHARTS)  

The FAA has adopted certain amendments to Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, which paved the way for the develop- ment of new area high altitude navigation (RNAV) "Q" routes in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). These amend- ments enable the FAA to take advantage of technological advancements in navigation systems such as the GPS. RNAV  "Q" Route MEAs are shown when other than FL 180 MEAs for DME/DME/Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) RNAV aircraft  have a "D" suffix.  

![](images/c333daa1c4292c9583a0d587bc525b8b4b5d584d08047319772e9802aaa9c52c.jpg)  

RNAV routes and associated data are charted in blue."Q" Routes on the IFR Gulf of Mexico charts are shown in black.  Magnetic reference courses are shown originating from a waypoint, fix/reporting point, or NAVAID.  

Joint Jet/RNAV route identification boxes will be located adjacent to each other with the route charted in black. With the  exception of Q-Routes in the Gulf of Mexico, GNSS or DME/DME/IRU RNAV are required, unless otherwise indicated. Q- Routes in Alaska are GNSS Only. Altitude values are stacked highest to lowest.

# FOREIGN AREAS  

Limited data is depicted in areas outside the U.S. on all appropriate Enroute U.S., Alaska and Pacific High/Low IFR  aeronautical charts. The data provided outside the U.S. is for situational awareness and transition planning. Areas outside  of the U.S. have been skeletonized and sybmolized in black and/or a black screen applied. This highlights the intent that  U.S. charts should only be used for navigation within domestic airspace and charts of other countries should be used  within their respective airspace.  

![](images/be42733a21d0d3685b30796bf07e1bd5825fc579a4dfebacd445970f81c09b6d.jpg)  

# TERRAIN CONTOURS ON AREA CHARTS  

Based on a recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board, terrain contours have been added to the  Enroute Area Charts and are intended to increase pilots' situational awareness for safe flight over changes in terrain. The  following Area Charts portray terrain: Anchorage, Denver, Fairbanks, Juneau, Los Angeles, Nome, Phoenix, San Fran- cisco, Vancouver and Washington.  

When terrain rises at least a 1,000 feet above the primary airports' elevation, terrain is charted using shades of brown with  brown contour lines and values. The initial contour will be 1,000 or 2,000 feet above the airports' elevation. Subsequent  intervals will be 2,000 or 3,000 foot increments.  

Contours are supplemented with a representative number of spots elevations and are shown in solid black. The highest  elevation on an Area Chart is shown with a larger spot and text.  

The following boxed note is added to the affected Area Charts.

# U.S. TERMINAL PROCEDURES PUBLICATION  

The U.S. Terminal Procedures Publication (TPPs) includes the Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs), Departure Proce- dures (DPs) charts, Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) charts, Charted Visual Flight Procedure (CVFP) charts,  and Airport  Diagrams. Also included are Takeoff Minimums, (Obstacle) Departure Procedures, Diverse Vector Area (RADAR Vectors),  RADAR and Alternate Minimum textual procedures.  

# EXPLANATION OF TPP TERMS AND SYMBOLS  

The information and examples in this section are based primarily on the IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) Terminal Proce- dures Publication (TPP). The publication legends list aeronautical symbols with a brief description of what each symbol  depicts. This section will provide more detailed information of some of the symbols and how they are used on TPP charts.  

FAA Terminal charts are prepared in accordance with specifications of the Interagency Air Committee (IAC) and their sup- porting technical groups for the purpose of standardization, which are approved by representatives of the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DoD).  

The Terminal Procedure Publication is made up of the following charts:  

•	 Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP) Charts •	 Airport Diagrams •	 Departure Procedures (DP) •	 Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) Charts •	 Charted Visual Flight Procedure (CVFP) Charts  

# INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURE CHART  

The IAPs (charts) are divided into various sections:  

Margin Identification Information		 Briefing Strip Information	 Planview	 	 	 Missed Approach Information  

Profile View Landing Minimums Airport Sketch  

![](images/a1cfb8b30ccb8403d6a83e4d483c544b0f53eeaaa39f09d0a69d532f715dc28f.jpg)  

![](images/8ff35c7fd3e26f80fde3289b71cd25aef09356be9bf8aa65302ee7d81e7080df.jpg)  

The margin identification at the top, bottom, and sides of the chart provides information about the airport location, proce- dure identification, and chart currency. The charts are organized by city first, then airport name and state, with the excep- tion of military charts, which are organized by airport name. Going from the top of the chart, reading from left to right, and  going down the chart, Margin Identification Information is organized in the following way.  

The hash marks along the top and bottom borders of military Instrument Approach Charts indicate that the procedure  was designed using High Altitude criteria contained in FAA Order 8260.3. These procedures are designed to support high  performance military aircraft operations and are not intended for civilian use.  

![](images/b202ae2ed481bd546ada46b6b7bf38ed65c512fd7f7ac32f9bc2550cc79201eb.jpg)  

# Top Margin Information:  

The city and state with which the airport is associated are located on both the top and bottom margins.  

At the center of the top margin is the FAA numbering system. This Approach and Landing (AL) number is followed by the  organization responsible for the procedure in parentheses, e.g., AL-18 (FAA). Military procedures do no show an AL num- ber, but do show the appropriate authority for the procedure, e.g., (USAF).  

![](images/7cdd66c4e9d9cf00791dd45cebd2a2336f08bf8cad5ac147d01fe32c6dc03018.jpg)  

The procedure title is located on both the top and bottom margins. It is derived from the type of navigational facility that is  providing the final approach course guidance. The title is abbreviated, e.g. ILS, RNAV, NDB, etc. For airports with parallel  runways and simultaneous approach procedures, “L”, “R” or “C” follows the runway number to distinguish between left,  right, and center runways.  

The airport name is shown on both the top and bottom margins below the procedure title. The airport identifier is shown in  parentheses following the airport name. Airports outside the contiguous United States will be shown with the FAA desig- nated identifier followed by the ICAO location identifier.  

The Date of Latest Revision is shown on the top margin above the procedure title. The Date of Latest Revision identifies  the Julian date the chart was last revised for any reason. The first two digits indicate the year, the last three digits indicate  the day of the year (001 to 365/6).  

![](images/e70d5e77485aec8b3436e625a1b6b0380fcde7e4c1ba1270d059292765e1395d.jpg)  

# Side Margin Information:  

The side margins show the volume identification, i.e. SW-3, followed by the current issue date and the next issue date,  e.g. SW-3, 21 JUL 2016 to 15 SEP 2016.  

# Bottom Margin Information:  

The FAA Procedure Amendment Number, located on the left bottom margin below the City, State, represents the most  current amendment of a given procedure. The Procedure Amendment Effective Date represents the AIRAC cycle date on  which the procedure amendment was incorporated into the chart. Updates to the amendment number and effective date  represent procedural/criteria revisions to the charted procedure, e.g., course, fix, altitude, minima, etc.  

Example: Original Procedure Date  

![](images/0d96f38c096e10094f9e21bbe10bf863d26e0330c7e9b191c417f60928d62ebc.jpg)

The coordinates for the airport reference point are located at the center of the bottom margin.  

# BRIEFING STRIP INFORMATION  

At the top of every TPP is the Briefing Strip that consists of three stacked strips of information immediately above the plan- view. Information varies depending upon the type of procedure.  

![](images/f07b4a1fa9186851dd935ad288c8a0d2e391a5da6aa9d04223a76b82ff3b074f.jpg)  

# Top Briefing Strip  

The top briefing strip contains procedural information in three separate boxes, in the following sequence from left to right:  

![](images/d93f20b66e96e59de075cac07c51c71fdc6b89ea8ab7e64649402d76449cecf8.jpg)  

•	 Box 1: Primary Procedure Navigation Information:  The primary navigation type (VOR, LOC, NDB, RNAV, etc.)  with its identifier and frequency/channel. If applicable, WAAS, the WAAS Channel Number, and the WAAS Refer- ence Path indicator are shown stacked top to bottom. If the primary navigation type is GBAS, then the following  information is shown, stacked top to bottom: GBAS, CH NNNN, RPI XXXX. If there is not a primary Navigation  Box required, the first box is removed.  

•	 Box 2: Final Approach Course Information . The inbound Approach Course (APP CRS) is shown.  

•	 Box 3: Runway Landing Information:  Stacked top to bottom, the runway landing distance (Rwy Ldg), the  Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE), and the Airport Elevation (Apt Elev) are shown. Runway landing distance is  determined by comparing the total runway length with the displaced threshold accounted for against the published  Declared Distance Landing Distance Available (LDA). The shortest of these lengths, either the published Declared  Distance LDA or the total runway length (minus displaced threshold) on the approach end of the runway, will be  charted.

# Notes Box  

# Procedure Equipment Requirements Notes Box  

Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) Requirements and ground-based Equipment Requirements are displayed in sepa- rate, standardized notes boxes. For procedures with PBN elements, the PBN box contains the procedure’s navigation  specification(s). If required, specific sensors or infrastructure needed for the navigation solution, additional or advanced  functional requirements, and the minimum Required Navigation Performance (RNP) value and any amplifying remarks  will also be included. Items listed in this PBN box are REQUIRED. The separate Equipment Requirements Box will list  ground-based equipment requirements.

# Notes Symbols  

Several different symbols may appear within the Notes Box:  

An entry is published in the Takeoff Minimums, (Obstacle) Departure Procedures, and Diverse Vector Area  (Radar Vectors) section of the TPP.  Non-standard IFR alternate minimums exist. Refer to IFR Alternate Airport Minimums section of the TPP. The IAP may not be used as an alternate due to unmonitored facility, absence of weather reporting service, or  lack of adequate navigation coverage. IAPs designated with this symbol are not listed in the IFR Alternate  Minimums section of the TPP.  WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System)  $.12^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$  Cold Temperature Airport  

The negative  $\pmb{\bigtriangledown}$   within a black square box symbol shown in the Notes section below any “A” or “T” Symbol indicates that  outages of the WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) vertical guidance may occur daily at this location due to initial  system limitations. WAAS NOTAMs for vertical outages are not provided for this approach. Use LNAV minima for flight  planning at these locations, whether as a destination or alternate. For flight operations at these locations, when the WAAS  avionics indicate that LNAV/VNAV or LPV service is available, then vertical guidance may be used to complete the ap- proach using the displayed level of service. Should an outage occur during the procedure, reversion to LNAV minima may  be required.  

When   $12^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$   appears in the Notes section below all other symbols it indicates a cold temperature altitude correction is  required at that airport when the reported temperature is at or below the published temperature. Advise ATC with alti- tude correction. Advising ATC with altitude corrections is not required in the final segment. See Aeronautical Information  Manual (AIM), Chapter 7, for guidance and additional information. For a complete list of cold temperature airports, see  https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/Cold Temp Airports.pdf .  

When “ASR”, “PAR” or “ASR/PAR” appear in the Note section immediately below the “T” and “A” symbols it indicates there  are published Radar Instrument Approach Minimums. Where radar is approved for approach control service, it is used  not only for radar approaches (Airport Surveillance Radar [ASR] and Precision Approach Radar [PAR]) but is also used to  provide vectors in conjunction with published non-radar approaches based on radio NAVAIDs (ILS, VOR, NDB, TACAN).  Radar vectors can provide course guidance and expedite traffic to the final approach course of any established IAP or to  the traffic pattern for a visual approach.  

# Bottom Briefing Strip (Communications Information)  

The communications briefing strip contains communication information when available, in separate boxes, listed from left  to right in the order that they would be used during arrival with the tower frequency box bolded:  

![](images/89748a295e51befd8d3928c5f744e5e6fb9d4cae10b678e1d134797f20a34b60.jpg)  

•	 ATIS, D-ATIS, AFIS (AK Only) or ASOS/AWOS frequencies (when available, ATIS or AFIS will be the only local  weather frequency/s published) •	 The primary Approach Control (APP CON) name and frequencies; when the primary approach service is provided  by other than Approach Control, e.g. FSS (Radio), Tower, Center, the appropriate air traffic facility call name is  provided •	 The Control Tower (TOWER) name and frequencies, to include Precision Radar Monitoring (PRM) and frequency •	 Ground Control (GND CON) frequencies •	 Clearance Delivery (CLNC DEL) frequencies; where a Control Tower does not exist or is part-time, a remoted  CLNC DEL may be listed. •	 Ground Communications Outlet (GCO) frequency •	 Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF), shown in parentheses when shares a frequency, e.g. UNICOM  122.8 (CTAF) •	 UNICOM or AUNICOM frequency •	 Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC)  

Note: Part-time operations will be annotated with a star. Check Chart Supplement for times of operation.  

# PLANVIEW  

The planview of the IAP charts provides an overhead view of the entire instrument approach procedure.  

The data on the planview is shown to scale, unless concentric rings, scale breaks or an inset have been used.

Complex IAP Example with RF Legs  

•	 Feeder Routes  (highlighted in blue - See Simple IAP Example on previous page) may be used to provide a tran-  

sition from the enroute structure to the IAF. 

 •	 Initial Approach  (highlighted in purple in examples above) is the segment between the initial approach fix (IAF)  and the intermediate fix (IF) or the point where the aircraft is established on the intermediate course or final ap- proach course.  

 •	 Intermediate Approach  (highlighted in yellow in examples above) is the segment between the intermediate fix or  point and the final approach fix.  

 •	 Final Approach Course  (highlighted in red in the examples above) is the segment between the final approach fix  or point and the runway, airport, or missed approach point. 

 •	 Missed Approach  (highlighted in green in the example above) begins at the MAP and continues until the desig- nated fix or waypoint. Missed Approach track is shown as a hash marked line in the planview. If the missed ap- proach fix falls outside of the area of the planview it will be shown in a separate box in the planview. 

 •	 DME arcs or Radius-to-Fix legs (RF)  are shown as smooth arcs from a designated start point to a designated  terminus.  

![](images/b8371abf93181d32ea02c3d64c70cb22646919d4d440cfe1ac2fc39df0622dc7.jpg)  
•	 Visual segment -   Instrument approach procedures, including Copter approach procedures, that terminate or  have missed approaches prior to the airport/heliport, and are authorized to proceed visually, will depict the visual  flight path by a dashed line symbol from the missed approach point to the airport.  

On RNAV charts where the visual track may only apply to a specific line of minima, the visual procedure track line  will not be shown in the planview. There will be a note directed to that portion of the procedure track.  

![](images/46c4e0fbdf2c2f3eede52e8822bb490c4d2d2b2b6608f29eb6b0b1f0cf182bf5.jpg)

# NAVAIDs  

NAVAIDs used on ground based charts will show the appropriate symbol accompanied by a data box that contains the  facility name, frequency, identifier and Morse code. A NAVAID box with a heavy line indicates the primary NAVAID used for  the approach.  

![](images/ee7c72b292de225be673dcc5cf344522c9ecf94abe30042468c57fe61261edc0.jpg)  

# Area Navigation (RNAV) Waypoints  

Waypoints are shown with the waypoint symbol accompanied by the five letter identifier. If an RNAV waypoint is collocated  with an intersection, DME fix, or NAVAID, the appropriate Intersection, DME fix, or NAVAID symbol will be charted.  

On RNAV (RNP) charts, any requirement/capability notes are depicted below the fix/waypoint/NAVAID name. When  the required RNP lateral accuracy value for any approach segment other than final approach (e.g. feeder, initial and/or  intermediate or missed) are less than standard (RNP 2.00 for feeder, RNP 1.00 for initial and/or intermediate and missed),  a note stating the required RNP value may be placed adjacent to the applicable fix at the beginning of the Feeder Route  (or annotated in the PBN box). If there is more than one lateral accuracy value within these portions of the procedure, the  lowest value is annotated. These notes will take the form “RNP 0.XX, or Min RNP 0.XX” and will be located in close prox- imity to the relevant fix name (or be identified in the PBN Box).  

# Localizer Depiction  

The localizer is depicted in the Planview using the following symbol. The size of the charted localizer symbol does not  serve as an indication of the service volume.  

![](images/1b7e932f5d4bc09d9bb4ef26953384281cfd6382b3bb2ec28cdc64047a8a7600.jpg)  

# Restrictive Airspeed  

Restrictive airspeeds are shown paired with their respective fix/facility.  

![](images/a14026b4be11578d8ef669672a79dfa6227a7127e4f1a30bd04b36682d0638c5.jpg)  

# Altitudes  

Restrictive altitudes are shown paired with their respective fix/ facility. Minimum, Maximum, Mandatory and Recommend- ed Altitudes are shown.  

![](images/a4e04e534f8605ee42d96729aeecbeb3fe9f211fd6b674259ab08567f9d58889.jpg)  

Altitudes that are shown along a route are minimum altitudes.  

![](images/2be3ab8515a3742cb3365247148f93d5733f4cccc76efd1f3a9475c0da00966c.jpg)  

# Holding Patterns and Procedure Turns  

Holding Patterns are used for many reasons, including deteriorating weather or high traffic volume. Holding might also be  required following a missed approach. Each holding pattern has a fix, a direction to hold from the fix, and an airway, bear- ing, course, radial, or route on which the aircraft is to hold. These elements, along with the direction of the turns, define  the holding pattern. Holding Patterns may not always be depicted to scale.  

![](images/206d37ecf4d9804c26dbb7c00dbd8ca7346ee6f58f3a4e9a49d582dbdc44915c.jpg)  

If a holding pattern has a non-standard speed restriction, it will be depicted by an icon with the limiting air speed shown  inside the holding pattern symbol. These elements, along with the direction of the turns, define the holding pattern. If two  types of holds are located at the same point, the procedural holding pattern will be shown in-lieu of arrival or missed ap- proach holding patterns. Timing or distance limits for Hold-in-lieu of Procedure Turn Holding Patterns will be shown.  

Waypoints designated as a holding fix are shown as fly-by, without the circle around the symbol. However, in the event the  holding fix/waypoint is also designated in all other parts of the procedure unrelated to holding with a fly-over function, then  the holding fix/waypoint will be charted as a fly-over point.  

A procedure turn (PT) is the maneuver prescribed to perform a course reversal to establish the aircraft inbound on an  intermediate or final approach course. The procedure turn or hold-in-lieu-of procedure turn is a required maneuver when it  is depicted on the approach chart. However, the procedure turn or the hold-in-lieu-of PT is not permitted when the symbol  “NoPT” is depicted on the initial segment being flown, when a RADAR VECTOR to the final approach course is provided,  or when conducting a timed approach from a holding fix. The procedure turn will be shown in the planview and in the  profile of the chart. In the planview, the tip of the procedure turn barb is shown at the procedure turn limit, e.g., 10 NM, 15  NM. Users should be aware that it is possible for there to be a terminal/feeder fix along the procedure track that is not as- sociated with the procedure turn. Fixes associated with the procedure turn are depicted in the profile.  

# Airports  

The primary approach airport is shown to scale by a pattern of all the runways. Airports other than the primary approach  airport may be shown with an airport pattern and name when in close proximity to the primary airport.  

![](images/030f2342ca71a87f9e4b754c87cba9406a7cdbc16a2b276038319b28db51af40.jpg)  

# Relief (Terrain Features)  

Terrain is depicted in the planview portion of all IAPs at airports that meet the following criteria:  

•	 If the terrain within the planview exceeds 4,000 feet above the airport elevation, or •	 If the terrain within a 6.0 nautical mile radius of the Airport Reference Point (ARP) rises to at least 2,000 feet  above the airport elevation.  

When an airport meets either of the above criteria, terrain will be charted by use of contours, spot elevations, and gradient  tints of brown on all IAPs for that airport. Contour layers will be shown in no more than five brown tints, with consecutively  darker tints used for consecutively higher elevation contour layers.  

![](images/641531142fac7c345f46ecd1781de2bcda06ffff123783db97b961391e27bad3.jpg)  

# Hydrography (Water)  

Water Depiction is depicted in grey, in the planview portion of IAPs. See previous example. The following hydrographic  features are shown:  

•	 Oceans •	 Significant rivers and streams •	 Significant lakes - If only one river or one small lake is involved, not located in the immediate airport vicinity, the  hydrographic information requirement may be waived.  

# International Boundary  

When the planview includes a boundary of another country  the International boundaries are shown by a dashed line.  International boundaries are identified with country name  within the country area.  

# Obstacles (Man-made, Terrain and Vegetation)  

![](images/dda68fc7922581e498a962c0ad131f5bdcbd80d2aa1adbb536df4a19de0e1104.jpg)  

Obstacles are shown as   when they are man-made or vegetation or as a   $\clubsuit$   when they are terrain. The highest ob- stacle, whether man-made or terrain is depicted with a bolder and larger symbol along with larger elevation font size. Any  obstacle that penetrates a slope of 67:1 emanating from any point along the centerline of any runway shall be considered  for charting within the area shown to scale. Obstacles specifically identified by the approving authority for charting shall be  charted regardless of the 67:1 requirement.  

Unverified obstacles shall be indicated by a doubtful accuracy symbol   $\pm$   following the elevation value.  

![](images/cbc83c9999c8690febce403da14ca95d0b91615730d0f5da262fe6cde05dd767.jpg)  

# Special Use Airspace (SUA)  

SUAs consists of that airspace wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, or  wherein limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activi- ties, or both. These are prohibited areas, restricted areas, warning areas, Military Operations  Areas (MOAs), and alert areas. SUA that falls within the area of coverage of the instrument  approach procedure chart are shown only when designated by the approving authority.  

# Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)  

ADIZ is an area of airspace in which the identification, location, and control of aircraft is re- quired in the interest of national security. When designated by the approving authority, ADIZ  boundaries that fall within the area of coverage of the chart are shown.  

![](images/f9e6d3d4c4c2aeac872d886a6c7454982ee4e0bcecbf09df093e61a57ce78af0.jpg)  

# Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA)  

MSAs are published for emergency use on IAP charts. MSAs appear in the planview of all IAPs except on approaches  for which a Terminal Arrival Area (TAA) is used. The MSA is based on the primary NAVAID, waypoint, or airport reference  point on which the IAP is predicated. The MSA depiction on the approach chart contains the identifier of the NAVAID/way- point/airport used to determine the MSA altitudes. MSAs are expressed in feet above mean sea level and normally have  a 25 NM radius; however, this radius may be expanded to 30 NM if necessary to encompass the airport landing surfaces.  Ideally, a single sector altitude is established and depicted on the planview of approach charts; however, when necessary  to obtain relief from obstructions, the area may be further sectored and as many as four MSAs established. When estab- lished, sectors may be no less than  $90^{\circ}$   in spread. MSAs provide 1,000 feet clearance over all obstructions but do not  necessarily assure acceptable navigation signal coverage.  

![](images/c3be707ea5cfede68eee0f65661d6b50c0e49fdf9f89b2f0fd2c1d611e4ee67e.jpg)  

The TAA icons will be positioned in the planview relative to their relationship to the procedure. The icon will not have  feeder routes, airways, or radar vectors depicted. The TAA provides a transition from the enroute structure to the terminal  environment with little required pilot/air traffic control interface for aircraft equipped with Area Navigation (RNAV) systems.  A standard TAA has three areas: straight-in, left base, and right base. The arc boundaries of the three areas of the TAA  are published portions of the approach. A TAA provides minimum altitudes with standard obstacle clearance when operat- ing within the TAA boundaries. TAAs are primarily used on RNAV approaches but may be used on an ILS approach when  RNAV is the sole means for navigation to the IF; however, they are not normally used in areas of heavy concentration of  air traffic.

# Helicopter (Copter) Procedures  

Copter procedures may contain either a visual or a VFR segment. Visual segments are depicted using the dashed line  symbol below.  

# Visual Flight Segment  

VFR Segments are not depicted with a line, but include the reference bearing and distance information at the endpoint of  the VFR Segment, when provided, as shown below.  

![](images/ae91537c84c6e3c63f700760890e82fda17dbb1c7a1d5b7403eaf1c18f332dfe.jpg)  
Example of Copter with VFR Segment (JFK)  

When a visual flight path or VFR segment is required from the MAP to the heliport or alighting area, and as necessary for  an explicit portrayal, an inset of the MAP area may be provided. This MAP area will depict significant landmark visual fea- tures. The procedure track, value and distance to the MAP and the visual segment and value to the landing point shall be  shown within this inset. If it is a VFR segment, the reference bearing and distance text will be shown at the landing point.

Example of Copter with Inset  

# MISSED APPROACH INFORMATION  

Missed approach information is shown in 3 locations on the chart:  

•	 The Middle Briefing Strip - The complete textual missed approach instructions are provided at the top of the ap- proach chart in the middle pilot briefing strip.  •	 The Planview - The missed approach track is drawn using a thin, hash marked line with a directional arrow. If the  missed approach fix is off the chart, the missed approach track shall extend to the chart border.  

Missed approach holding patterns that lie outside the geographic parameters of the planview and are unable to  be shown with a scale break will be shown as a boxed inset. All alternate missed approach holding patterns will  be shown in an inset.  

![](images/4966c72008450c32856f151a50f439b7c6a3b8adc6abb6491d582a3fae04cfc3.jpg)  

•	 The Profile Box - Missed Approach Icons will be depicted in the upper left or upper right of the profile box. The  Missed Approach Icons are intended to provide quick, at a glance intuitive guidance to the pilot, to supplement  the textual missed approach instructions in the briefing strip. Space permitting, all textual missed approach in- structions will be graphically depicted in sequence. If space does not permit the depiction of all missed approach  icons, only the first four icon boxes will be shown.  

![](images/898db414051047b7a1a737718b29f5a424751d8805a5bd8ff112650151723c1f.jpg)  

# PROFILE VIEW  

A profile diagram of the instrument approach procedure is shown below the planview. The published descent profile and  graphical depiction of the vertical path using those facilities, intersections, fixes, etc. identified in the procedure to the  runway are shown. A profile view of the procedure track is shown. The approach track begins toward the top of the pri- mary facility line, unless otherwise dictated by the procedure, and shall descend to where the final approach ends and the  missed approach begins.  

When a reference mark (\*, \*\*, #, etc.) is shown in the profile, the qualifying footnote is provided within the profile section.

# Precision Approaches  

On precision approaches, the glideslope (GS) intercept altitude is illustrated by a zigzag line and an altitude. This is the  minimum altitude for GS interception after completion of the procedure turn. Precision approach profiles also depict the  GS angle of descent, threshold crossing height (TCH) and GS altitude at the outer marker (OM) or designated fix.  

![](images/8c68b036541e6672ff26cc65826eb1333b7cbc548bf37d3c5ac1c37cccfee75e.jpg)  

On non-precision approaches, the final segment begins at the Final Approach Fix (FAF), which is identified with the Mal- tese cross symbol  . When no FAF is depicted, the final approach point is the point at which the aircraft is established  inbound on the final approach course. Stepdown fixes may also be provided between the FAF and the airport for autho- rizing a lower minimum descent altitude (MDA) and are depicted with the fix or facility name and a dashed line. Altitude  restrictions at stepdown fixes on the final approach on procedures with both precision and non-precision minima are not  applicable to precision (ILS, LPV, or LNAV/VNAV) use of the approach. On non-precision only approach procedures, the  approach track descends to the MDA or VDP point, thence horizontally to the missed approach point.  

![](images/e942530dbb24ef66783b309b1e309254ff52ddcc793032190a1e433539a29c93.jpg)  

# Visual Decent Point (VDP)  

The Visual Descent Point (VDP), is shown by a bold letter  $"\sqrt"$   positioned above the procedure track and centered on the  accompanying dashed line. (See example below.) The VDP is a defined point on the final approach course of a non- precision straight-in approach procedure from which normal descent from the MDA to the runway touchdown point may be  commenced.  

![](images/a012c6719c672890f631ec407c5e4541f6f9f2cb21abe42c39ba3f2459d10fbc.jpg)  

# Vertical Descent Angle (VDA) and Threshold Crossing Heights (TCH)  

A VDA and TCH may be published on non-precision approaches. For Copter approach procedures, a Heliport Crossing  Height (HCH) will be depicted in place of the TCH. The VDA is strictly advisory and provides a means to establish a stabi- lized descent to the MDA. The presence of a VDA does not guarantee obstacle protection in the visual segment. If there  are obstacles in the visual segment that could cause an aircraft to destabilize the approach between MDA and touchdown,  the profile will not show a VDA and will instead show a note that states “Visual Segment-Obstacles”.  

![](images/fe33b23221a71044c9ef823851aa900cf9be0322f3cc7a36c63361340e8e2602.jpg)  

# Visual Flight Path  

Instrument approach procedures, including Copter approach procedures, that terminate or have missed approaches prior  to the airport, and are authorized to proceed visual, shall depict the visual segment by the dashed line symbol from the  missed approach point to the airport. The note “Fly visual” (“Proceed visually” on Copter procedures) along with the bear- ing and distance shall be shown leadered to the visual flight path.  

RNAV charts sometimes have visual flight for LNAV/VNAV minima that do not start at the missed approach point. An ad- ditional note indicating “LNAV/VNAV” will be placed above the note.  

Copter approach procedures with a VFR segment from the missed approach point will not depict the VFR segment with a  line in the profile. The note similar to “Proceed VFR from MAP” will be shown.  

![](images/f9dc02c36b14b86673a88383d1482b1d3b831e256603c11c3f6ea590944178ec.jpg)

Chart Examples  

# ILS Glide Slope and RNAV Glidepath  

A note providing the glide slope (GS) or glidepath (GP) angle and the threshold crossing height (TCH), are positioned in  the lower half of the profile box  

•	 GS will be shown on all ILS procedures. •	 GP will be shown GLS procedures and all RNAV procedures with a published decision altitude  

Threshold Crossing Height (TCH) has been traditionally used in “precision” approaches as the height of the glide slope  above threshold. With publication of LNAV/VNAV minimums and RNAV descent angles, including graphically depicted  descent profiles, TCH also applies to the height of the “descent angle,” or glidepath, at the threshold.  

# 34:1 Surface Clear Stipple Symbol  

On RNAV approach charts, a small shaded arrowhead shaped symbol from the end of the VDA to the runway indicates  that the 34:1 Obstacle Clearance Surface (OCS) for the visual segment is clear of obstacles. The absence of the symbol  indicates that the 34:1 OCS is not clear or a Visual Segment-Obstacles note is indicated on the chart. (See example in  VDP Section.)  

# Secondary Airports  

Airports other than the airport of intended landing will be shown when requested and will be portrayed in the same manner  as the primary airport. It will be placed in its approximate location along the final approach course.

# LANDING MINIMUMS  

The landing minimums section is positioned directly below the profile. This section gives the pilot the lowest altitude and  visibility requirements for the approach. There are two types of landing minimums: Straight-in landing or Circling. Straight- in landing minimums are the MDA and visibility, or DA and visibility, required for a straight-in landing on a specified runway.  Circling minimums are the MDA and visibility required for the circle-to-land maneuver.  

The minimums for straight-in and circling are located under each aircraft category. When there is not a division line be- tween minimums for each category, the minimums apply to two or more categories.

![A second category of straight-in minimums called "sidestep" may be depicted where parallel runways exist. ](images/60ca01f868fff0ddb57131480637c61b6ccbbbf01f72b72031edb399f3ecdeb4.jpg)  

The terms used to describe the minimum approach altitudes differ between precision and nonprecision approaches. Preci- sion approaches use DA and nonprecision approaches use MDA, both expressed in feet MSL. The minimum approach  altitudes are also referenced to height above touchdown elevation (HAT) for straight-in approaches, or height above  airport (HAA) for circling approaches. The figures listed parenthetically are for military operations and are not used in civil  aviation.  

The visibility values are shown after the DA or MDA. They are provided in statue miles or runway visual range (RVR).  RVR is reported in hundreds of feet. If the visibility is in statute miles, there is an altitude number, hyphen, whole or frac- tional number, e.g. 530-1. This indicates 530 feet MSL and 1 statute mile of visibility. The RVR value is separated from the  minimum altitude with a slash, e.g., 1540/24. This indicates 1540 feet MSL and RVR of 2400 feet. When an RVR value  is shown, the comparable statute mile equivalent is shown within the military minimums in parentheses as shown in the  examples above. This value is determined from the Comparable Values of RVR and Visibility table located in the TPP  Legend.

# Circling Minimums  

There was a change to the TERPS criteria in 2012 that affects circling area dimension by expanding the areas to provide  improved obstacle protection. To indicate that the new criteria had been applied to a given procedure, a   $\boxplus$   is placed on  the circling line of minimums. The new circling tables and explanatory information is located in the Legend of the TPP.  

The approaches using standard circling approach areas can be identified by the absence of the  $\clubsuit$   on the circling line of  minima.

# AIRPORT SKETCH  

The airport sketch is a depiction of the airport with emphasis on runway pattern and related  information, positioned in either the lower left or lower right corner of the chart to aid pi- lot recognition of the airport from the air and to provide some information to aid on ground  navigation of the airport. The runways are drawn to scale and oriented to true north. Runway  dimensions (length and width) are shown for all active runways.  

![](images/d0bbabe6e9d6590bbaee8c2d7aea090a47e22a2ca752d129493650429f825f0c.jpg)  
Runway(s) are depicted based on what type and construction of the runway.  

![](images/0ef158fce4fbd4a80ab882e9b3d8919d771859c56d0ee26fd0acd9c91de6096e.jpg)  

Taxiways and aprons are shaded grey. Other runway features that may be shown are runway numbers, runway dimen- sions, runway slope, arresting gear, and displaced threshold.  

Other information concerning lighting, airport beacon, obstacles, control tower, NAVAIDs, and helipads may also be  shown. The final approach course or an extension of the final approach course will be shown on all IAPs except ILS CAT  II, ILS CAT II & III, ILS SA CAT I, ILS SA CAT II, and ILS SA CAT I & II.  

# Airport Elevation and Touchdown Zone Elevation  

The airport elevation is shown enclosed within a box in the upper left corner of the sketch box and the touchdown zone  elevation (TDZE) is shown in the upper right corner of the sketch box. The airport elevation is the highest point of an  airport’s usable runways measured in feet from mean sea level. The TDZE is the highest elevation in the first 3,000 feet of  the landing surface. Circling only approaches will not show a TDZE.  

# Runway Declared Distance Information  

Runway declared distance information when available will be indicated by   $\boxplus$   and is shown to the right of the airport  elevation in the sketch box. Declared distances for a runway represent the maximum distances available and suitable for  meeting takeoff and landing distance performance requirements.  

Notes regarding approach lighting systems are shown at the bottom of the sketch box. Run- way lights (HIRL) (MIRL) (LIRL) (TDZL)(TDZ/CL) shall be indicated by a note, e.g. HIRL Rwy  9-27. Pilot capability to acitvate the airport lighting is shown using a   $\pmb{\dot{\Theta}}$   symbol.  

Other approach lighting is shown on the airport sketch as a symbol on the side of the runway  where they are actually located. Symbols that are shown in negative indicate pilot-controlled  lighting.  

Runway centerline lights (CL) are installed on some precision approach runways to facilitate  landing under adverse visibility conditions. They are located along the runway centerline and  are spaced at 50 foot intervals. Runways with CL are shown in a negative dot pattern through  the middle of the solid runway as illustrated in the airport sketch to right.  

Runway centerline lights will be indicated by a note only when pilot controlled or when paired  with TDZL, e.g., TDZ/CL Rwys 6 and 24.

# Time/Distance Table  

When applicable, a Time/Distance Table is provided below the airport sketch. The table provides the distance and time  that is required from the final approach fix to the missed approach point for select groundspeeds.  

# Base Information (Copter Approaches Only)  

Base Information, as required and necessary to identify the MAP area and in the vicinity of the landing area shall be pro- vided. Information shall be limited to and depict significant visual landmark features at and surrounding the MAP area and  the heliport/pad of intended landing.  

# AIRPORT DIAGRAMS  

Airport Diagrams are specifically designed to assist in the movement of ground traffic at locations with complex runway/ taxiway configurations. Airport Diagrams are not intended for use in approach and landing or departure operations. An  airport diagram assists pilots in identifying their location on the airport, thus reducing requests for “progressive taxi instruc- tions” from controllers.

# Runway Construction  

![Runway construction is depicted as follows: ](images/e3f0a31bbed9f6a32ed60675a9f6525a62504e852f05e3bc5feb12db516db875.jpg)  

# Hot Spots  

Hot Spots (HS) are a runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airport. Typically it is a complex or confus- ing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition may be compounded by a mis communication  between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a  history of surface incidents or the potential for surface incidents.  

Hot Spots are indicated on the Airport Diagram with a brown open circle or ellipse leadered to a Hot Spot number, e.g.,  HS 1. The number corresponds to a listing and description on the Hot Spot page in the front the TPP. More information  and the location of Hot Spots can be found at  http://www.faa.gov/airports/runway_safety/hotspots/hotspots_list/ .  

# DEPARTURE PROCEDURES (DPs)  

Departure Procedures (DPs) are designed specifically to assist pilots in avoiding obstacles during the climb to the mini- mum enroute altitude, and/or airports that have civil IFR takeoff minimums other than standard. There are two types of  DPs: Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODPs), printed either textually or graphically and Standard Instrument Departures  (SIDs), always printed graphically. SIDs are primarily designed for system enhancement and to reduce pilot/controller  workload, and require ATC clearance. ODPs provide obstruction clearance via the least onerous route from the terminal  area and may be flown without ATC clearance. All DPs provide the pilot with a safe departure from the airport and transi- tion to the enroute structure.  

Generally, DP charts are depicted “not to scale” due to the great distances involved on some procedures or route seg- ments. A “to scale” portrayal may be used if readability is assured.  

The DP will show the departure routing, including transitions to the appropriate enroute structure. All routes, turns, alti- tudes, NAVAIDs, facilities forming intersections and fixes, and those facilities terminating the departure route are shown. A  textual description of the departure procedure is also provided. For RNAV DPs, the transition text consists of the transition  name and associated computer code. On non-RNAV DPs, the transition text will also include the description of all turns,  altitudes, radials, bearings and facilities/fixes needed to guide the user from the common departure point to the terminat- ing facility fix.  

Copter DPs may also include a visual or VFR segment. Visual segments are depicted using the dashed line symbol be- low.  

VFR Segments are not depicted with a line, but include the reference bearing and distance information at the endpoint of  the VFR Segment, when provided, as shown below.  

# Example of Copter with VFR Segment  

# STANDARD TERMINAL ARRIVAL (STARs) CHARTS  

STARs are pre-planned Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) air traffic control arrival procedures for pilot use in graphic and/or tex- tual form. STARs depict prescribed routes to transition the aircraft from the enroute structure to a fix in the terminal area  from which an instrument approach can be conducted. STARs reduce pilot/controller workload and air-ground communi- cations, minimizing error potential in delivery and receipt of clearances.  

STAR charts generally shall be depicted ‘not to scale’ due to the great distances involved on many procedures and route  segments. A ‘to scale’ depiction may be used only if readability is assured.  

The STAR will show the arrival routing, including transitions from the appropriate enroute structure. All routes, turns,  altitudes, NAVAIDs, facilities forming intersections and fixes, and those facilities/fixes terminating or beginning the arrival  route shall be shown in the graphic depiction. A textual description of the arrival procedure is also provided. For RNAV  STARs, transition text will consist of the transition name and associated computer code. For non-RNAV STARs, the transi- tion text will also include a description of all turns, altitudes, radials, bearings and facilities/fixes needed to guide the user  from the entry point to the common facility/fix.  

# CHARTED VISUAL FLIGHT PROCEDURE (CVFP) CHARTS  

CVFPs are charted visual approaches established for environmental/noise considerations, and/or when necessary for the  safety and efficiency of air traffic operations. The approach charts depict prominent landmarks, courses, and recommend- ed altitudes to specific runways. CVFPs are designed to be used primarily for turbojet aircraft. CVFPs are not instrument  approaches and do not have missed approach segments.  

CVFPs are named for the primary landmark and the specific runway for which the procedure is developed, such as:  RIVER VISUAL RWY 18, STADIUM VISUAL RWY 24. The CVFP charts are divided into planview and notes sections  separated by a bar scale in 1 NM increments. The planview of the CVFP includes the portrayal of visual approach proce- dures information, such as landmarks, NAVAIDs, visual track, hydrography, special use airspace and cultural features, as  applicable.  

CVFPs originate at or near, and are designed around, prominent visual landmarks and typically do not extend beyond  15 flight path miles from the landing runway. Visual tracks start at a geographical point or landmark where the procedure  must be flown visually to the airport. The visual track is indicated by a dashed line. Visual tracks may include the track  value, distance and minimum or recommended altitudes.
