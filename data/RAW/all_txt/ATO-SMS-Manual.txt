# Safety Management System Manual  December 20 22  

Air Traffic Organization  

# FOREWORD  

The fundamental mission of the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is to ensure the safe provision of  air traffic services in the National Airspace System (NAS).  Thanks to its employees, the ATO  operates the safest, most efficient air traffic system in the world.  

As the ATO helps build the Next Generation Air Transportation System, the resulting  cross-organizational changes to the NAS require an intensive, proactive, and systematic focus  on assuring safety.  The ATO uses the Safety Management System (SMS) to achieve this.  The  SMS constitutes the operating principles that support the ATO in objectively examining the  safety of its operations.  

This document is the result of an ATO-wide effort and reflects current international best  practices and intra-agency lessons learned.  It marks an important next step toward a mature  and integrated SMS in the FAA.  Therefore, it is important that all ATO personnel work diligently  to uphold and follow the procedures and guidance in this SMS Manual to manage safety risk  and help promote a positive safety culture in the ATO and the FAA.

# 1.1 About the Safety Management System Manual  

The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Safety Management System (SMS) is a formalized and  proactive approach to system safety.  It directly supports the mission of the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA): “to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world.”  The  ATO  SMS  is an integrated collection of policies, processes, procedures, and programs used to  manage safety risk in the provision of air traffic management and communication, navigation,  and surveillance services.  

The ATO SMS Manual informs ATO employees and contractors about the goal of the ATO  SMS, describes the interrelationship among the four components of the SMS, and instructs  readers on the process of identifying safety hazards and mitigating risk in the National Airspace  System (NAS).  More detailed guidance on the practical application of the SMS, and specifically  Safety Risk Management (SRM), is contained in the annex of this document.  This SMS Manual  and its complements, such as the Safety Risk Management Guidance for System  

Acquisitions (SRMGSA), ATO Safety Guidance documents, and other FAA safety documents,  are used to carry out the safety mission of the FAA and requirements of the SMS.  

# 1.1.1 Changes to the SMS Manual  

Safety and Technical Training (AJI) reviews this SMS Manual annually.  Individuals who would  like to propose a change to the document may submit comments via the  ATO SMS Policy  Management Portal .  

# 1.2 Establishment and Continuous Support of the ATO SMS  

Safety , the principal consideration of all ATO activities, is defined as the state in which the risk  of harm to persons or damage to property is acceptable.  Managing and assuring the safety of  operations using the SMS has long been a focus of air navigation service providers worldwide,  with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) having provided the guiding principles  and the mandate for member organizations to use an SMS.  The ATO’s SMS efforts support the  FAA safety mission, which emphasizes continuous improvement of safety and the integration of  safety management activities across FAA organizations, programs, and Lines of  Business (LOBs).  Efforts to develop and implement complex, integrated Next Generation Air  Transportation System systems to improve the safety and efficiency of air travel in the United  States make clear the relevance of the SMS.  

# 1.3 SMS Policy Derivations  

The ATO SMS is supported by numerous levels of policy and requirements, as depicted in  Figure 1.1 .  Relevant programs that predate the SMS are detailed in other FAA publications and  processes.  This SMS Manual only references those documents when necessary.   Section 1.8   lists many of the related documents.

Figure 1.1: SMS Policy and Requirements Hierarchy  

# 1.3.1 ICAO SMS Policy  

The FAA derives its high-level SMS policy from ICAO policy.  ICAO Annex 19,  Safety  Management , provides standards and recommended practices for safety management for  member states and air traffic service providers.  Additionally, ICAO Document 9859,  Safety  Management Manual (SMM) ,   provides guidance for the development and implementation of the  SMS for air traffic service providers.  ICAO Document 9859 also provides guidance for safety  programs in accordance with the international standards and recommended practices contained  in Annex 19.  

# 1.3.2 FAA SMS Policy  

FAA Order 8000.369,  Safety Management System , describes the essential aspects of an SMS  and provides implementation guidance to FAA organizations.  This document is designed to  create a minimum SMS standard that each FAA LOB can follow to implement an SMS.  

FAA Order 8040.4,  Safety Risk Management Policy , establishes requirements for how to  conduct SRM in the FAA.  It formalizes SRM guidance for FAA LOBs and Staff Offices and  describes specific steps when performing and documenting SRM that crosses FAA LOBs.  The  ATO must consider and, when necessary, use the provisions in this order when coordinating  SRM with other FAA organizations.  AJI functions as the ATO liaison to interface with outside  organizations.  Within the ATO, AJI adjudicates discrepancies among Service Units.  

# 1.3.3 Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service Order  

The Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service (AOV) provides independent safety oversight of the  ATO.   FAA Order 1100.161,  Air Traffic Safety Oversight , provides high-level SMS requirements  of the ATO and AOV.  When AOV involvement is required, AJI functions as the liaison between  AOV and other ATO Service Units and organizations.  Additional guidance from AOV is  submitted via Safety Oversight Circulars (SOCs) that provide information that may be used by  

the ATO to develop and implement internal procedures.  AOV publishes all SOCs on the  intranet .  

# 1.3.4 ATO SMS Policy and Requirements  

FAA Order JO 1000.37,  Air Traffic Organization Safety Management System , documents  high-level SMS requirements, roles, and responsibilities.   FAA Order JO 1030.1,  Air Traffic  Organization Safety Guidance , establishes a method and process for providing the ATO with  supplemental guidance material pertinent to the SMS.  The SRMGSA provides SMS  requirements and guidance pertinent to programs proceeding through the FAA Acquisition  Management System (AMS) process.  The ATO has also established Quality Assurance and  Quality Control orders that govern safety data collection and the establishment of safety-related  corrective actions.  Those orders are as follows:  

   FAA Order JO 7210.632,  Air Traffic Organization Occurrence Reporting      FAA Order JO 7210.633,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Assurance (QA)      FAA Order JO 7210.634,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Control      FAA Order JO 7200.20,  Voluntary Safety Reporting Programs  

All ATO organizations and individuals under the purview of FAA Order JO 1000.37 must adhere  to the provisions of the aforementioned documents and this SMS Manual.  If discrepancies exist  between this SMS Manual and FAA orders and guidance, including those that originate outside  the ATO, notify the Safety Management Group, AJI-31, Manager via the  ATO SMS mailbox .  

# 1.4 The Four Components of SMS  

There are four components of the SMS that combine to create a systematic approach to  managing and ensuring safety.  These components are:  

   Safety Policy:  The documented organizational policy that defines management’s  commitment, responsibility, and accountability for safety.  Safety Policy identifies and  assigns responsibilities to key safety personnel.     SRM:  A process within the SMS composed of describing the system; identifying the  hazards; and analyzing, assessing, and treating risk.  SRM includes processes to define  strategies for monitoring the safety risk of the NAS.     Safety Assurance:  A set of processes within the SMS that verify that an organization  meets or exceeds its safety performance objectives and that function systematically to  determine the effectiveness of safety risk controls through the collection, analysis, and  assessment of information.     Safety Promotion:  The communication and distribution of information to improve the  safety culture and the development and implementation of programs and/or processes  that support the integration and continuous improvement of the SMS within the ATO.   Safety Promotion allows the ATO to share and provide evidence of successes and  lessons learned.  

Figure 1.2  represents the relationship of the four SMS components in an integrated model.  The  integration and interaction of the four components is essential to managing the SMS effectively  and fostering a positive safety culture.  

![](images/951b3a87b30dcea2d9ba25a1d75e40ad285d9efc8eac092d6604252deb3e2b75.jpg)  
Figure 1.2: The Integrated Components of the SMS  

# 1.4.1 Safety Culture and Promotion in the ATO  

Safety culture  is defined as the way safety is perceived and valued in an organization.  It  represents the priority given to safety at all levels in the organization and reflects the real  commitment to safety.  The ATO uses its SMS to promote a positive safety culture through  policies that align safety goals with organizational standards, training, voluntary reporting, and  best practices.  

A strong safety culture helps ensure that personnel are trained and competent to perform their  duties and that continual updates on training are provided.  Promoting strong safety values  means that all ATO employees share lessons learned from investigations and experiences, both  internally and from other organizations.  

Safety Promotion programs and activities are vital to achieving positive safety outcomes  throughout the ATO.  The tenets of Safety Promotion are used to foster a positive safety culture  in which ATO employees understand why safety is important and how they affect it, providing a  sense of purpose to safety efforts.  Each employee must consider the potential effect that their  decisions may have on safety, and each employee is responsible for understanding the  significance of their job as it relates to safety.  SMS training identifies the importance of the SMS  and how each employee and contractor fits into the mission of using the SMS to improve safety  in the ATO.  For more information on SMS training, refer to the  ATO SMS Toolbox .  

Open communication is critical to a positive safety culture.  The ATO communicates safety  objectives to all operational personnel to improve the way safety is perceived, valued, and  prioritized.  In an organization with a strong safety culture, individuals and groups take  responsibility for safety by communicating safety concerns and striving to learn, adapt, and  modify individual and organizational behavior based on lessons learned.  

1.4.1.1 Safety Programs and Initiatives   The ATO maintains a positive safety culture using programs and initiatives such as:  

   Recurrent Training:  An initiative that uses collaboratively developed instruction  designed to maintain and update previously learned skills while promoting a positive  safety culture.  

   Top 5 Program:  A program that identifies high-priority data-driven safety issues that are  trending in the NAS.  The Top 5 is determined based on data obtained from the Aviation  Risk Identification and Assessment (ARIA) automated system, Voluntary Safety  Reporting Programs, stakeholder input, and other databases used to log and report  unsafe occurrences.  

   Fatigue Risk Management:  A group that provides operational fatigue risk expertise,  guidance, and support to the ATO in developing fatigue reduction strategies and policy  recommendations to mitigate and manage operational fatigue risks in the NAS.  

   Partnership for Safety:  A joint effort between the ATO and the National Air Traffic  Controllers Association that encourages employees to become actively engaged in  identifying local hazards and developing safety solutions before incidents occur.  

   Voluntary Safety Reporting Programs  

o   Air Traffic Safety Action Program (ATSAP):  A confidential system for controllers  and other employees to voluntarily identify and report safety and operational  concerns.  For more information, refer to the  ATSAP website .  

o   Confidential Information Share Program (CISP):  A program for the sharing and  analysis of information collected through the ATSAP and airlines' Aviation Safety  Action Programs to provide a more complete representation of the NAS.  For more  information, visit the  CISP website .  

o   Technical Operations Safety Action Program (T-SAP):  A system for reporting  safety-related events or issues pertaining to operations, equipment, personnel, or  anything believed to affect safety in the NAS for technicians and other Technical  Operations employees.  For more information, refer to the  T-SAP website .  

   Change Advisory Group:  A group that promotes open communication with ATO SMS  stakeholders and affected organizations by providing an effective and efficient policy  revision process and expediting the review and concurrence process for the ATO SMS  Manual.  

   Runway Safety:  A team that works with all stakeholders to develop innovative programs  and techniques to reduce the severity and likelihood of surface incidents.  

   Lessons Learned:  An initiative that improves ATO processes, addresses deficiencies  proactively, and empowers employees to play a direct role in the safety of the NAS by  providing valuable safety information.  

# 1.5 SMS Benefits  

ATO processes and tools that support the SMS help:  

   Provide a common framework to proactively and reactively identify and address safety  hazards and risks associated with NAS equipment, operations, and procedures;     Encourage intra-agency stakeholders to participate in solving the safety challenges of an  increasingly complex NAS;     Reduce isolated decision-making by using integrated safety management principles;     Improve accountability for safety through defined managerial roles and responsibilities   and SRM processes;     Integrate Safety Assurance processes that enable the ATO to effectively measure safety  performance;     Provide documentation of the ATO’s data-based efforts to improve NAS safety using a  repeatable process;     Promote a continuous cycle of assessing, correcting/mitigating, and monitoring the  safety of air navigation services;     Foster a positive safety culture that can help improve system safety; and     Measure the performance and support the improvement of the SMS.  

# 1.6 SMS Continuous Improvement  

The SMS is the framework that the ATO uses to measure and help ensure the safety of its  operations.  In an evolving NAS, it is necessary to continuously seek improvement in ATO  processes and policies that support ATO safety efforts and, by extension, support the SMS.   The ATO and external organizations conduct audits and assessments to measure and  determine compliance with the policies and procedures used to manage safety in the NAS.  By  assessing SMS maturity, the ATO is able to identify gaps in SMS performance, opportunities for  improvement, and areas in which to focus new policy development.  

# 1.6.1 Measuring NAS-Wide ATO Safety Performance  

Historically, the ATO has based the identification of risk on whether an operation was compliant  or separation was maintained; however, this approach has not always identified all aspects of  risk in the most effective manner.  Similarly, compliant operations have, on occasion and under  certain applications, introduced varying levels of risk into the NAS.  

Moving forward, the ATO will rely more on risk-based safety data to identify and analyze safety  issues and evaluate the effectiveness of safety risk mitigation.  The ATO has adopted a  risk-based approach to collecting and analyzing data, rather than gathering and evaluating data  based solely upon existing compliance standards.  Understanding the level of risk associated  with an operation is a holistic safety method that can proactively look beyond compliance.   Risk-based safety addresses shortcomings without the boundaries of traditional  compliance-based analysis.  

Due to the ATO’s transition from compliance-based safety assurance to Risk-Based Safety  Management, FAA Order JO 7210.633 replaced Risk Analysis Events and the Risk Analysis  Process with ARIA.  Through ARIA, an airborne module identifies and measures potential risk  between aircraft encounters by utilizing radar and other surveillance data.  Each encounter is  given a score through a Barrier Analysis Review.  By basing mitigation efforts on aggregated  data that identifies and validates risk in the system, the ATO is able to focus on a systemic view  of the operation to identify risk before it leads to an event.  

# 1.7 Policy Compliance with SMS  

As the ATO’s SMS matures, the tenets of the SMS components are integrated into new and  existing ATO policy.  For a directive to be considered compliant with the SMS, it must  incorporate safety measures and SMS requirements to help manage safety.  

# 1.8 FAA Documents Related to SMS Requirements

# 2.1 Introduction to Managing System Safety  

As Air Traffic Organization (ATO) operational procedures and National Airspace System (NAS)  equipment (i.e., hardware and software) evolve, their interaction and interdependency across  organizations within the ATO and throughout the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must be  addressed.  In a system as large and diverse as the NAS, the identification of a safety hazard  and mitigation of its risk often falls within the purview of multiple organizations.  

The effects of safety hazards and associated risk management methods across multiple  organizations, domains, and implementation timelines must be properly understood to achieve  the highest practical level of safety.  Safety risk deemed acceptable for an individual element of  the NAS may lead to unintentional safety risk in another element if Safety Risk  Management (SRM) is not conducted with a “system of systems” philosophy.  As emerging NAS  equipment, operations, and procedures are tested and implemented, the SRM process must  account for their potential safety impact on existing/legacy tools and procedures and vice versa.   Sharing safety data and using an integrated safety management approach helps identify and  resolve issues requiring the consideration of multiple disciplines.  

The goal of an integrated approach to safety management is to eliminate gaps in safety  analyses by assessing NAS equipment, operations, and procedures across three planes:  vertical, horizontal, and temporal.  The vertical plane is hierarchical, providing assessments  from a specific project up to the NAS-level system of systems of which the project is a part.  The  horizontal plane spans organizations, programs, and systems.  Finally, the temporal plane  attempts to eliminate safety gaps across program and system implementation timelines.   Figure 2.1  depicts several factors in each of the three planes that should be considered to  ensure an integrated approach to safety management.  Refer to the  Safety Risk Management  Guidance for System Acquisitions  for more information.  

![](images/4a97f9ad80b870ae098a82d9aa69ff47396c13a15cc55399a4288b7d4e0c9e10.jpg)  
Figure 2.1: Integrated Safety Factors  

# 2.2 Safety Assessment Using the Tenets of SRM and Safety Assurance  

In acknowledging the complexity of the NAS and its various system interdependencies, the ATO  uses the systematic processes and tenets of SRM and Safety Assurance to identify and  address safety hazards and risks across the NAS.  

The remainder of this section discusses the foundational concepts and practices used to identify  and address safety issues and consider potential ramifications in an integrated way.  It will  

describe at a high level the underlying causes of safety hazards and the means by which the  ATO manages and tracks safety risk.  

The SRM process provides the framework to track a NAS change after it has been implemented  using Safety Assurance functions to determine whether controls and/or safety requirements are  performing as intended/designed.  Refer to  Figure 2.2  for a depiction of the relationship between  SRM and Safety Assurance.  

![](images/5f2d8127a4fe67e6f14485a0229b94083b4ef88c08f1278103e629010927a6dc.jpg)  
Figure 2.2: SRM / Safety Assurance Process Flow  

# 2.3 SRM: Proactive and Reactive Hazard and Risk Management  

SRM is a formalized approach to integrated system safety.  It   both   informs decision-makers  about the potential hazards, safety risks, and ways to reduce risk associated with a particular  proposal   and identifies ways to mitigate existing safety issues in the NAS.  The methodology is  applied to all NAS equipment, operations, and procedures to identify safety hazards and  address risk.  

It is necessary to make the approach to managing safety risk into a formalized, objective  process.  This helps ensure the effective management of a safety hazard’s risk.  SRM provides  a means to:  

   Identify potential hazards and analyze and assess safety risk in ATO operations and  NAS equipment;     Define safety requirements to reduce risk to an acceptable level;     Identify safety performance targets, the measurable goals used to verify the predicted  residual risk of a hazard; and     Create a plan that an organization can use to determine if expected risk levels are met  and maintained.  

# 2.4 Safety Assurance: Identifying and Closing Safety Gaps  

SRM alone does not ensure the safety of the services the ATO provides; equally important are  the efforts performed under the umbrella of Safety Assurance.  Safety Assurance builds on  SRM efforts by collecting and assessing data to monitor compliance, assess the performance of  safety measures, and identify safety trends.  It provides the means to determine whether NAS  equipment, operations, and procedures—and changes to them—meet or exceed acceptable  safety levels.  The Safety Assurance component of the Safety Management System (SMS)  encompasses all of the ATO processes and programs that survey the NAS.  These processes  and programs can lead to the discovery of previously unidentified existing safety issues and risk  controls that are outdated or no longer effective.  

Continuous improvement of the safety of the NAS can occur only when an organization is  vigilant in monitoring the performance of its operations and corrective actions.  Refer to  Section 6 for more information about the ATO programs that fit within the Safety Assurance  component of the SMS.  

# 2.4.1 The Top 5 Program  

The Top 5 Program leverages the vast amount of safety data collected through mandatory and  voluntary reporting programs and stakeholder feedback to identify trending safety issues and  develop Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) to address and monitor the safety performance of those  issues.  The program uses SRM principles to guide its process.  The Top 5 Steering Committee,  composed of directors from ATO Service Units and representatives from the Air Traffic  Supervisors’ Committee and National Air Traffic Controllers Association, oversees the  decision-making needs of the Top 5.  

When identifying an item for the Top 5, observed safety trends are broken down into discrete  issues by assessing details such as causal factors and system states.  Subject matter experts  from stakeholder organizations then participate on CAP Teams to perform an in-depth data  review and identify mitigations that may reduce the prevalence and/or criticality of the observed  safety trend.  The team also sets safety performance targets that must be met prior to closing  the issue from the Top 5.  Safety and Technical Training (AJI) works to ensure corrective  actions are implemented and monitors each issue against its performance targets to determine  when closure of each issue from the Top 5 can occur.  

The review performed by each CAP Team is documented and kept in the Top 5 issue portfolio,  which is updated and signed annually by the Director of Policy and Performance, AJI-3, on  behalf of the Top 5 Steering Committee.  CAPs and monitoring strategies may be updated on a  

yearly basis, and these updates are captured in addenda to the issue portfolio.  If any  mitigations identified through the CAP are potential changes to the NAS, those changes must  go through the SRM process.  The Top 5 issue portfolio may be used as input to the safety  analysis but does not serve as a substitute for an SRM document, if one is needed.  

# 2.4.2 Audits and Assessments  

To continuously improve the safety of its NAS equipment, provisioned services, operations, and  procedures, the ATO conducts audits and assessments to determine whether the NAS is  performing as expected.  ATO employees also use audit and assessment techniques to test,  validate, and verify safety data obtained and produced by the various entities and organizations  in the NAS.  Furthermore, ATO audits and assessments identify causes and correlations that  can improve the understanding of safety performance.  

Audits and assessments are defined as follows:  

   An assessment is the process of measuring or judging the value or level of something.   The objective of an assessment is to determine the organization’s ability to achieve its  goals and accomplish its mission.     An audit is a review that verifies conformance to established criteria, processes, and  work practices.  The objective of an audit is to determine an organization’s compliance  with FAA directives and procedures.  

Audits and assessments verify positive and negative safety trends.  If a safety issue or hazard is  identified through an audit or assessment, SRM is used to document the hazard and identify  mitigations.  In this sense, Safety Assurance and SRM complement each other by providing a  continuous loop of hazard identification and risk management methods.  

Audits and assessments may be scheduled or unscheduled formal reviews; examinations; or  verifications of activities, controls, ATO operations, and ATO systems.  The scope of safety  audit and assessment activities can vary.  An audit or assessment can either focus on a single  procedure / piece of NAS equipment or broadly examine multiple elements of a system.  

The ATO uses both audits and assessments at the facility, district, Service Area, and national  levels.  Using the above-described methodologies, the ATO assesses safety performance  through:  

   Proactive evaluation of facilities, equipment, documentation, and procedures  (e.g., internal assessments);     Proactive evaluation of Service Delivery Point performance, thus verifying the fulfillment  of Service Delivery Point safety responsibilities (e.g., periodic competency checks in the  form of Quality Control, operational skills assessments, and system safety reviews); and     Periodic evaluations to verify a system’s performance in control and management of  safety risks (e.g., internal and external audits and assessments).  

For additional information about the ATO’s audit and assessment program, refer to  FAA Order  JO 2900.2,  Air Traffic Organization Audits and Assessments .  

# 2.4.3 ATO Quality Assurance and Quality Control  

Requirements and guidance for Quality Assurance and Quality Control are contained in three  ATO orders:  FAA Order JO 7210.632,  Air Traffic Organization Occurrence Reporting ;  FAA Order JO 7210.633,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Assurance (QA) ; and  FAA Order JO 7210.634,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Control .  

These orders provide specific direction for the reporting, investigating, and recording of air traffic  incidents.  Responsibilities for assessing trends and noncompliance are also provided, along  with guidance for identifying and correcting performance deficiencies.  

# 2.5 Identifying and Addressing System Vulnerabilities  

Before performing SRM, it is important to acknowledge the potential origins of safety hazards in  the NAS.  Daily operations in an ever-changing air traffic environment can present varying  hazards and levels of safety risk.  Given the complex interplay of human, material, and  environmental factors in ATO operations, the complete elimination of all hazards and safety risk  is unachievable.  Even in organizations with excellent training programs and a strong safety  culture, mechanical and electronic equipment will fail, software will function in an unintended  manner, and human operators will make errors.  

# 2.5.1 System Gaps and Hazard Defenses  

Developing a safe procedure, hardware, or software system requires that the procedure/system  contain multiple defenses, ensuring that no single event or sequence of events results in an  incident or accident.  Failures in the defensive layers of an operational system can create gaps  in defenses, some known and others unknown.  Gaps “open” and “close” as the operational  situation, environment, or equipment serviceability state changes.  A gap may sometimes be the  result of a momentary oversight on the part of a controller or operator, typically described as an  active failure .  Other gaps may represent long-standing  latent failures  in the system.  Latent  conditions exist in the system before negative effects can occur.  The consequences of a latent  condition may lie dormant for extended periods of time.   Figure 2.3  illustrates how an incident or  accident can penetrate all of a system’s defensive layers.  

![](images/7774f8403a45cd78836ce7b098d1141a2b0f35b49b2f765dd8f0234bcb160847.jpg)  
Figure 2.3: Defenses in Depth  

These gaps may occur due to:  

   Undiscovered and long-standing shortcomings in the defenses,     The temporary unavailability of some elements of the system due to maintenance action,     Equipment failure,     Human interaction, and     Policy/Decision-making.  

# 2.5.2 Hazard Defenses  

Designers of NAS hardware and software must strive to design systems that will not impose  hazardous conditions during abnormal performance.  Using a key systems engineering concept,  such systems are referred to as being fault tolerant.  A  fault-tolerant  system includes  mechanisms that will preemptively recognize a fault or error so that corrective action can be  taken before a sequence of events can lead to an accident.  A subset of a fault-tolerant system  is a system that is designed to be fail safe.  A  fail-safe  system is designed such that if it fails, it  fails in a way that will cause no harm to other devices or will not present a danger to personnel.  

Error tolerance , another systems engineering concept, is a system attribute in which, to the  maximum extent possible, systems are designed and implemented in such a way that errors do  not result in an incident or accident.  An error-tolerant design is the human equivalent of a  fault-tolerant design.  

Design attributes of an error-tolerant system include:  

   Errors are made apparent,     Errors are trapped to prevent them from affecting the system,     Errors are detected and warnings/alerts are provided, and     Systems are able to recover from errors.  

For an accident or incident to occur in a well-designed system, gaps must develop in all of the  defensive layers of the system at a critical time when defenses should have been capable of  detecting the earlier error or failure.  Functions, equipment, procedures, and airspace  components of the NAS interact through numerous complex relationships.  Given the temporal  nature of these relationships, the ATO must continuously monitor safety risk to maintain an  acceptable level of safety performance and prevent gaps.  

# 2.6 The Human Element’s Effect on Safety  

Human error is estimated to be a causal factor in the majority of aviation accidents and is  directly linked with system safety error and risk.  For this reason, hardware and software system  designers must eliminate as many errors as possible, minimize the effects of errors that cannot  be eliminated, and reduce the negative effect of any remaining potential human errors.  

Human performance variability is a limitation that necessitates a careful and complete study of  the potential effect of human error.  Human capabilities and attributes differ in areas such as:  

   Manner and ability of the senses (e.g., seeing, hearing, and touching),     Cognitive functioning,   Reaction time,    Physical size and shape, and     Physical strength.  

Fatigue, illness, and other factors (e.g., stressors in the environment, noise, and task  interruption) also affect human performance.  Optimally, the system is designed to resist, or to  at least tolerate, human error.  

When examining adverse events attributed to human error, it is often determined that elements  of the human-to-system interface (e.g., display design, controls, training, workload, or manuals  and documentation) are flawed.  The study of human reliability and the application of human  performance knowledge must influence system design for safety systems and be an integral part  of risk management.  Recognizing the critical role that humans and human error play in complex  systems and applications has led to the development of the human-centered design approach.   This approach is central to the concept of managing human error that affects safety risk.  

# 2.7 Closing Gaps Using SRM and Safety Assurance Principles and Processes  

Safety risk can be reduced proactively and reactively.  Monitoring operational data, carefully  analyzing the system, and reporting safety issues make it possible to proactively detect and  prevent sequences of events where system deficiencies (i.e., faults and errors, either separately  or in combination) could lead to an incident or accident before it actually occurs.  The same  approach also can be used to reactively analyze the chain of events that led to an accident or  incident.  With adequate information, safety professionals can take corrective action to  strengthen the system’s defenses when devising new air traffic procedures, operations, and  NAS equipment or when making changes to them.  The following is an illustrative, but not  comprehensive, list of typical defenses used in combination to close gaps in defenses:  

Equipment defense strategies:  

  

o  Full redundancy, which provides the same level of functionality when operating on  the alternate system  o  Partial redundancy, which results in some reduction in functionality (e.g., local copy  of essential data from a centralized network database)     Independent checking of design and assumptions     System design that ensures that critical functionality is maintained in a degraded mode if  individual elements fail     Policy and procedures regarding maintenance to prevent a loss of some functionality in  the active system or a loss of redundancy     Automated aids or diagnostic processes designed to detect system failures or  processing errors and to report those failures appropriately     Scheduled maintenance     Implementation of robust system development assurance programs in system  acquisitions  

Operating procedures:  

   Adherence to standard phraseology and procedures     Read-back of critical items in clearances and instructions  

   Checklists and habitual actions (e.g., requiring a controller to follow through the  projected flight path of an aircraft, looking for conflicts, and receiving immediate  coordination from the handing-off sector)     Inclusion of a validity indicator in designators for Standard Instrument Departures and  Standard Terminal Arrival Routes     Training and reporting methods  

Organizational factors:  

   Management commitment to safety     A strong, positive safety culture     Safety policy implementation with adequate funding provided for safety management  activities     Oversight to ensure that correct procedures are followed     A zero-tolerance policy toward willful violations or shortcuts     Control over the activities of contractors  

# 2.8  Safety Order of Precedence  

The methods for reducing safety risk generally fall under one of the four categories that make  up the Safety Order of Precedence.  The Safety Order of Precedence categorizes safety risk  mitigations in the following order of preference:  

# Table 2.1: Safety Order of Precedence and Examples  

![](images/257d77ea8ebb947718fa25390a15d537cc586c151a66f536d07453a467b39f51.jpg)  

Note: Reliance solely on training is normally not a sufficient means to mitigate safety risk.  

# 3.1 Scope of the Safety Risk Management Process  

The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Safety Risk Management (SRM) process is used to  determine the safety risk of National Airspace System (NAS) changes or existing safety issues  associated with the provision of air traffic management services.  These services include the  acquisition, operation, and maintenance of hardware and software; management of airspace  and airport facilities; and development of operations and procedures.  Security (e.g., physical,  information, and cyber), environmental, or occupational safety and health issues that potentially  affect the provision of air traffic management services should be considered during the SRM  process.  Conversely, if these issues do not have an effect on the safe provision of air traffic  management services, these issues should not be considered.  

It is important to note that the SRM process is not designed to and should not be used to  account for programmatic considerations that are related to the environment, finance, budget, or  labor/human resources.  Additionally, safety hazards associated with the environment,  occupational safety, or security that can or do affect the provision of air traffic management  services must be reported to the appropriate authority.  

This section provides a linear SRM process to follow, guidelines to identify safety hazards and  mitigate their risks, and requirements for the development of consistent and thorough safety  analyses.  Using the steps in this section to perform SRM will not always result in an exhaustive  study of air traffic procedures, operations, or NAS equipment (i.e., hardware and software).  The  appropriate level of detail used when conducting SRM depends on the complexity, size, and  potential effect of the NAS change or existing safety issue.   Figure 3.1  provides a high-level  depiction of the key steps, decision points, and outputs of the SRM process.  

![](images/d13f9d6bf668a5e74b079682e06cd457892befc38544e61cdc8d1bfd08f676a8.jpg)  
Figure 3.1: SRM Process  

# 3.2  When to Perform SRM  

SRM is most frequently performed in response to a NAS change.  NAS changes may be  proposed and initiated as part of implementation plans for new/modified air traffic procedures,  operations, or NAS equipment, or in response to existing safety issues currently in the NAS.   For the ATO, a  NAS change  is a modification to any element of the NAS that pertains to, or  could affect, the provision of air traffic management and/or communication, navigation, and  surveillance services.  Air traffic controllers and technicians, their training, and their certification  are elements of the NAS and directly relate to the provision of air traffic services.  

In some cases, SRM is performed in response to a request to take action on an existing safety  issue.   Existing safety issues  are existing contributing factors or findings that led to, or could  lead to, an unsafe outcome.  Requests for action to address such issues may be proposed and  initiated as part of a Safety Assurance function.  This is usually a result of Quality Assurance,  audits, or assessments.  If a request to take action on an existing safety issue is received, SRM  must be performed.  

Though not all NAS changes will require SRM, the decision and justification to forgo performing  SRM is a safety decision.  If there is uncertainty as to the appropriate path to take, contact a  Safety and Technical Training (AJI) Safety Case Lead (SCL) for assistance.  The following list  presents NAS changes 1   that will require SRM.  It is important to note that this does not  constitute a complete list or explanation of all NAS changes that require SRM.  

   Operational/procedural changes or waivers that are not defined in an existing order  (e.g., flight trials, tests, demonstrations, and prototypes that are live in the NAS)     Any waiver or change to an order, if the order implements a procedure that, when  followed, could affect the provision of air traffic services     Introduction of new types of navigation procedures into the NAS     Changes to separation minima (refer to the  ATO Safety Guidance (ATO-SG)  ATO-SG-15-05,  Safety and Technical Training Guidance on Separation Minima )     Addition, modification, closure, or removal of an airport, runway, or taxiway; airport  building construction; and lighting changes    Note: Many of the changes that fall into this category are proposed and sponsored by  the Office of Airports (ARP); ARP Safety Management System (SMS) requirements are  documented in  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 5200.11,  FAA  Airports (ARP) Safety Management System .  The ATO must remain vigilant to ensure  the SRM process is conducted on construction projects to maintain continued  compliance with air traffic procedures and operations.     New NAS systems used in Air Traffic Control (ATC) or pilot navigation (or new uses for  such existing systems), regardless of their applicability to the FAA Acquisition  Management System (AMS)     System Support Directives that introduce new requirements and/or change requirements  for risk-assessed operational systems/equipment in the NAS, such as:  o  Communication, navigation, and surveillance systems  o  Weather products/services  o  Displays  o  Alerting and advisory systems  o  Service provider equipment (e.g., the Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast  (ADS-B) system and FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure)  o  Local adaptations (e.g., resulting from a Program Trouble Report)  o  Decision support tools  

   System Support Directives that are built with different levels of rigor (e.g., development  assurance levels) than what was required during initial acquisition-level SRM     Changes to system certification and maintenance standards, requirements, and  practices (e.g., technical handbooks)     Before NAS equipment, procedures, systems, or services are removed, discontinued,  deactivated, or decommissioned from the NAS     Site adaptations, if the acceptable technical limits for such adaptations are not defined in  the system-level SRM work approved prior to the In-Service Decision, or if such limits  are to be exceeded     ATC facility changes, including:  o  Tower siting or relocation  o  Facility relocation  o  Cab replacement or redesign  o  Permanent consolidation or de-consolidation of facilities  o  Facility split  o  Temporary tower      All charting specification changes prior to submission to the Interagency Air Committee  for final signature (e.g., symbology, color changes in routes, and route identifiers)     Airspace changes, including routes, airways, and sectors, and the addition or deletion of  a position or sector     Changes to policies, procedures, or NAS equipment for which training exists     Removal of or modifications/waivers to existing national and/or local training  requirements   that could affect the NAS or NAS operations, except for the purposes of  individual performance management     Establishment of or modifications to Technical Training, AJI-2, orders, architecture, and  curricula     If conditions of the assumptions change in any way during the SRM process, initial risk  must be reassessed     When an emergency modification is necessary 2  

# 3.3  When SRM May Not Be Required  

Some NAS changes do not require SRM.  The change proponent must use the criteria in this  section and   Section 3.2  to make this determination.  

SRM does not need to be performed for NAS changes that are compliant with  policies/processes that have undergone SRM and have been documented with approval by the  appropriate management official.  If these policies or procedures are changed, or if any NAS  change deviates from these policies or procedures, SRM must be performed to manage the  safety risk.  Note that editorial and administrative changes (i.e., any changes that do not affect  the substantive elements of a procedure or system) do not require SRM.  

FAA and/or ATO documents (e.g., policies, directives, manuals, Standard Operating  Procedures (SOPs), Letters of Agreement, and Letters of Procedure) for developing and  implementing many routine and repeatable NAS changes could be considered compliant with  the ATO SMS, meaning that SRM was performed, documented, and approved.  For example,  routine procedures such as flight inspections are conducted in accordance with  FAA Order  8200.1,  United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual .  If there are no changes to those  procedures, then SRM is not required.  However, if there is a change to the frequency of flight  inspections, SRM is required.  

Modifications made to systems to meet initial operational specifications (e.g., Problem Trouble  Reports) may not require additional SRM if the system specifications have previously  undergone SRM.  The modification and testing processes must also be compliant with the SMS.  

# 3.3.1 Examples of NAS Changes Unlikely to Require SRM  

The following list presents NAS changes that will likely not require SRM.  It is not a complete list  or explanation of all NAS changes that do not require SRM.  

   Facility layout/redline/end-state drawings (e.g., Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR),  Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility, or Air  Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)), as identified in the Configuration Control Board  Charter, Appendix A     System Support Directives that do not change requirements and have followed AMS  development assurance processes     Changes to directives for those directives with no safety functionality     Installation or moving of equipment if defined installation siting processes are not  violated     Maintenance actions, as specified in maintenance technical handbooks  

Contact the Safety Engineering Team, AJI-314, Manager via the  ATO SMS mailbox  for  assistance determining if SRM is required.  

# 3.4 NAS Change Proposals  

The configuration management requirements from the NAS Change Proposal (NCP) process  may not specifically relate to safety effects.  When a NAS change covered by an NCP requires  SRM, the appropriate documentation must be included in the material provided to the  Configuration Control Board.  In terms of SRM, an NCP can be categorized as one of the  following:  

 Does not require SRM    Requires SRM (refer to Annex A)  

For more information on NCPs, refer to  FAA Order 1800.66 , Configuration Management Policy  

For information on SRM for technology refreshment portfolios, see the  Safety Risk Management  Guidance for System Acquisitions (SRMGSA) .  

# 3.5  SRM Process Phases  

SRM is composed of a five-phase process called the DIAAT, presented in  Figure 3.2 .  The  DIAAT phases are described in detail in  Section 3.6  through  Section 3.10 .  

![](images/323d272a3fd3dd417407ac935544e3b70b5b68ac1862324f277f8a28eb65e1a4.jpg)

# 3.6.1 Overview  

As discussed in  Section 3.2 , NAS changes may be proposed and initiated as part of  implementation plans for new or modified air traffic procedures, operations, or NAS equipment,  or in response to existing safety issues in the NAS.  As part of any pre-SRM panel activities and  any follow-on SRM panel activities, it is important to develop a detailed description of the NAS  change and/or current system and its affected elements.  

Note: SRM for mitigations to existing hazards that were identified through safety audits or  post-event safety risk analyses should use the event or situation that led to the realization of the  hazard’s effect(s) as the basis for the documented system description.  Use this section as  guidance, but refer to  Section 3.7.3  for further information.  

# 3.6.2 Bounding SRM in an Integrated NAS  

Bounding  refers to the process of limiting the analysis and assessment of a change or system  to only the elements that affect or interact with each other to accomplish the central function of  that change or system.  In many cases, there may be a limited or incomplete understanding of  the air traffic environment in which the NAS equipment, operation, or procedure will be  employed, or the interconnected systems with which the changing system must be integrated  for effective operation.  Furthermore, the scope for other associated NAS equipment,  operations, or procedures may be unknown.  Thus, it becomes difficult to ensure that there are  no gaps across the boundaries of the change or system.  As a result, the scope may be  inadvertently set at an inappropriate level.  

In light of these potential difficulties, the scope must be set such that gaps are eliminated.  As  systems become increasingly more complex, interactive, and interrelated, the analysis and  assessment of potential safety risk must be integrated temporally, by domain, and across  locations.   Figure 3.3  provides a visual representation of this integration.  Where time is  concerned, it is important to consider whether potential safety risk mitigations implemented in  the short term will be adequate years into the future when other systems are introduced in the  NAS, or whether other follow-on mitigations will negate the effect of those implemented in the  past.  

![](images/293815aea4331ebb507037742bdc03383354f0afaab07ef266f02a054e54cda3.jpg)  
Figure 3.3: The Complex Integration Aspects of a Capability  

Figure 3.4  depicts the potential scope and level of SRM required based on the potential impact  and scope of the NAS change.  The lowest-tiered SRM focuses on identifying hazards  associated with individual projects/programs and individual changes to the NAS that are often  associated with new system acquisitions.  The middle tier is the capability level.  Examples of  capabilities include Performance Based Navigation, Surface Operations, or Data  Communications.  Here, system safety risk analyses and assessments become more complex,  considering multiple combinations of dependent functions.  The top tier represents high-level  SRM activities associated with service levels and/or domains to reflect a strategic view of safety  across the NAS.  Safety management at this level is more static in nature (i.e., essentially  

non-recurring system safety engineering).  It employs high-level functional hazard analyses to  identify NAS-level hazards and safety requirements that flow down vertically to the other-tiered  levels.  

![](images/c7b779c7e1d93ad08987666135b3d5a880749f95e47d87a30d51f99274b1fd30.jpg)  
Figure 3.4: Three Tiers of Integrated Safety Management  

# 3.6.3 Depth and Breadth of the NAS Change or Existing Safety Issue  

In general, SRM for more complex and far-reaching NAS changes or existing safety issues will  require a greater scope and more detail.  When evaluating a NAS change or existing safety  issue, consider any potential effects on organizations outside the ATO (e.g., Aviation Safety and  ARP).  Consider the following factors:  

   The depth of the NAS change or existing safety issue.   The complexity and nature  (i.e., operational or system acquisition) of the NAS change will dictate the type and  number of analyses or assessments required.     The breadth of the NAS change or existing safety issue.   The scope of SRM will  require additional details when the NAS change affects more than one organization or  Line of Business (LOB).  

# 3.6.4 Involving Other FAA LOBs  

When ATO SRM impacts FAA LOBs and/or organizations outside the ATO, the provisions and  guidance in  FAA Order 8040.4,  Safety Risk Management Policy , apply.  Refer to  Section 3.7.7   for information on coordinating and addressing safety issues.  Refer to  Section 5.4.1  and  Section 5.4.2  for discussion on cross-LOB risk acceptance.  

# 3.6.5 Setting the Scope of Individual SRM Analyses and Assessments  

Guidelines to help determine the scope of individual SRM analyses and assessments include:  

   Having a sufficient understanding of system boundaries, including interfaces with peer  systems, larger systems of which the system is a component, and users and  maintainers;  

   Determining the system elements that interact or sub-system components that may be  affected; and     Limiting the system to those elements that affect or interact with each other to  accomplish the mission or function.  

When setting the scope of individual SRM analyses and assessments:  

   Define the relationships/interactions of the NAS change.      Identify temporal aspects of these relationships/interactions.     Collect safety documentation that has determined the building blocks of the NAS  change.     Set the scope wide enough to determine the aggregated risk and address any gaps.  

# 3.6.6 Describing the System / NAS Change  

System descriptions need to exhibit two essential characteristics: correctness and  completeness.  Correctness means that the description accurately reflects the system without  ambiguity or error.  Completeness means that nothing has been omitted and that everything  stated is essential and appropriate.  

The system description provides information that serves as the basis for identifying all hazards  and associated safety risks.  The system/operation must be described and modeled in sufficient  detail to proceed to the hazard identification stage of the DIAAT process.  For example,  modeling might entail creating a functional flow diagram to help depict the system and its  interface with the users, other systems, or sub-systems.  

As discussed, the system is always a component of some larger system.  For example, even if  the change encompasses all services provided within an entire ARTCC, that ARTCC can be  considered a subset of a larger body of airspace, which in turn is a subset of the NAS.  

Complex NAS changes may require a detailed system description that includes numerous  charts, drawings, design descriptions, and/or narratives.  Simple NAS changes may only require  one or two paragraphs describing the system and NAS change.  The description must be clear  and complete before continuing the SRM process.  Questions to consider include:  

   What is the purpose of the NAS change?      What issue is necessitating the NAS change?     How will the change be used / function in the NAS?     What are the boundaries and external interfaces of the NAS change or system?     In what environment will the system or NAS change operate?     How is the system or NAS change interconnected/interdependent with other systems?     How will the NAS change affect system users/maintainers?     If the NAS change is a waiver/renewal, how could other waivers in effect interact with it?  

The following are examples of information to consider when describing the system:  

   Average annual approaches to each runway   Fleet mix  

   Number and type of airport operations     Number of aircraft controlled (ground, pattern, and transitions)     Number of hours the airport operates and number of aircraft controlled under Visual  Flight Rules (VFR) versus Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)     Availability and reliability of both hardware and software  

Section 7  identifies sources of data to use in SRM.  

Once the system elements are listed, a careful review of the NAS change description should be  conducted.  A bounded system limits the analysis and assessment to the components  necessary to adequately determine the safety risk associated with the NAS change, system,  and/or operation.  When there is doubt about whether to include a specific element in the  analysis, it is preferable to include that item, even though it might prove irrelevant during the  hazard identification phase.  

# 3.6.6.1 5M Model Method  

The 5M Model can be used to capture the information needed to describe the system and aid in  hazard identification.  The 5M Model uses a Venn diagram to depict the interrelationships  among its five elements, as seen in   Figure 3.5 .  To adequately bound and describe a system, it  is important to understand the relationships between the elements of the 5M Model.  

The 5M Model illustrates five integrated elements that are present in any system:  

   Mission:  The clearly defined and detailed purpose of the proposed NAS change or  system/operation     (hu)Man/Person:  The human operators, maintainers, and affected stakeholders     Machine:  The equipment used in the system, including hardware, firmware, software,  human-to-system interfaces, system-to-system interfaces, and avionics     Management:  The procedures and policies that govern the system’s behavior     Media:  The environment in which the system is operated and maintained  

![](images/1da123b93351249c78bc741a1b241915e9fa79713b171b1a668f60e56e1b24d8.jpg)  
Figure 3.5: 5M Model  

The 5M Model and similar techniques are used to deconstruct the proposed NAS change in  order to distinguish elements that are part of or affected by the proposed NAS change.  These  elements later help to identify sources, causes, hazards, and current and proposed risk  mitigation strategies.  

# 3.7 DIAAT Phase 2: Identify Hazards  

![](images/6d61cb731b268dbbde8a10de9043c292c90ffe268b9e3f5cc9d8bf335587c4e1.jpg)  

# 3.7.1 Overview  

During the hazard identification phase, identify and document hazards, their possible causes,  and corresponding effects.  This phase is required to determine the appropriate means to  address any safety risks associated with a NAS change or existing safety issue.  A  hazard  is  defined as any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death to people;  damage to or loss of a system, equipment, or property; or damage to the environment.  A  hazard is a prerequisite to an accident or incident.  

The following resources and methods can be used to identify hazards:  

   The safety analysis that accompanies the proposed implementation of a new or modified  operation, process, or piece of NAS equipment;     Air Traffic Safety Action Program   and Technical Operations Safety Action Program   reports;     Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service (AOV) compliance audits;  

   Aviation Risk Identification and Assessment (ARIA); 3      National Transportation Safety Board safety recommendations;     ATO Audits and Assessments;     Audits performed as part of facility-level Quality Control efforts or AJI Quality Assurance  efforts; and     Reports of unsafe conditions in daily operations.  

Refer to  Section 6  for information about the various audit and reporting programs and tools.  

# 3.7.2 Potential Sources of Hazards  

The hazard identification stage considers all possible causes of hazards.  The use of previous  hazard analyses when identifying hazards is important, as it provides consistency in SRM and can  reduce the time needed to identify hazards.  For example, approved SRM documents on similar  NAS changes or earlier integrated assessments, including applicable cross-organizational safety  assessments and Independent Operational Assessments (IOAs), may be useful.  Refer to  Section 6  for information on IOAs.  

Depending on the nature and size of the system under consideration, the causes may include:  

   NAS equipment failure/malfunction,     Operating environment (including physical conditions, airspace, and air route design),     Human operator failure/error,     Human-machine interface problems,     Operational procedures limitations/design,     Maintenance procedures limitations/design, and/or     External services.  

# 3.7.3 Existing Hazards  

An existing hazard is any hazard that is currently in the NAS.  Existing hazards often fall into the  following categories.  

# 3.7.3.1 Hazards Identified but Not in the Scope of an Ongoing NAS Change  

These hazards must typically be addressed through a separate, follow-on safety analysis  performed by the organization deemed responsible.  An AJI SCL can assist in determining  which organization should be notified about the existing hazard(s) identified.  

# 3.7.3.2 Hazards Identified by Audits  

When an audit identifies a potential safety issue, the issue must be addressed.  Refer to  FAA  Order JO 2900.2,  Air Traffic Organization Audits and Assessments .  

# 3.7.3.3 Emergency Modifications  

There may be unusual, unforeseen, or extraordinary issues or conditions that require the  implementation of hardware or software solutions in a timeframe that does not allow proceeding  

through the formal SRM process.  Emergency modifications are temporary fixes installed to  maintain continuity of air navigation, air traffic control, communications, or support services  during unusual or emergency conditions.  Such NAS changes may result from unforeseen  natural occurrences, a lack of replacement parts, software patches, or real-time situations that  require immediate action.  Refer to  FAA Order 6032.1,  National Airspace System (NAS)   Modification   Program , for more information on emergency modifications.  

A memorandum must be sent to the Director of Policy and Performance, AJI-3, within two days  of the implementation of the modification.  

The memorandum must:  

   State what system was modified,      Provide a summary of the emergency modification,      Identify why the modification was made, and      Indicate when the safety risk assessment will be conducted.  

The official who authorized the emergency modification must ensure that SRM is performed in  accordance with the ATO SMS Manual within 30 days of the implementation of the modification.   After SRM is completed, a follow-up memorandum must be sent to the AJI-3 Director stating  that it has been completed and uploaded to the Safety Management Tracking System (SMTS).   The AJI-3 Director must inform AOV and the ATO Chief Operating Officer (COO).  

# 3.7.3.4 Existing High-Risk Hazards  

When the AJI-3 Director validates an existing hazard as high risk, they must notify the ATO  COO and AOV of the high risk and the interim actions needed to mitigate the risk.  The ATO  COO must approve the interim action and accept the associated risk or require the operation to  be stopped.  The responsible Service Unit must coordinate with the AJI-3 Director to address  the risk and any potential corrective actions.  

Thirty calendar days after the notification is sent to the ATO COO and AOV, the responsible  Service Unit must coordinate with the AJI-3 Director to develop a permanent plan that will  eliminate the hazard or reduce the risk to an acceptable level and provide that plan to AJI.  The  plan must include:  

   A description of the hazard and system state,      The severity and likelihood of the high risk,      Data or empirical evidence that justifies the determination that a high-risk hazard exists,      Safety requirements or a decision to cease the operation,      A schedule to complete an SRM document in accordance with this SMS Manual, and     An approval signature by the Vice President of each responsible/affected Service Unit.  

Cessation is viable if the prescribed means are inadequate to reduce the risk to an acceptable  level.  In some cases, though, cessation of the operation may not be the safest means to  mitigate the risk.  There could be unintended consequences that result in more potential harm or  increase system safety risk.  

The Service Unit must forward the plan with a memorandum via its Vice President to the Vice  President of AJI for approval and copy the AJI-3 Director, who will then forward the  memorandum to AOV.  AJI will notify AOV of any subsequent changes to the approved plan.   The hazard must be documented in an SRM document that is written in accordance with this  SMS Manual and uploaded to SMTS within 30 calendar days of the implementation of the final  safety requirements.  The responsible Service Unit must adhere to the SRM documentation  approval and risk acceptance requirements documented in this SMS Manual.  

# 3.7.4 Elements of Hazard Identification  

When considering new NAS equipment and procedures or planned modifications to current  NAS equipment and procedures, define the data sources and measures necessary to identify  hazards.  The elements of a thorough system description contain the potential sources of  hazards associated with the proposed NAS change.  There are numerous ways to do this, but  all require at least three elements:  

   Operational expertise that relates specifically to the operation or equipment,     Training or experience in various hazard analysis techniques, and     A defined hazard analysis tool.  

# 3.7.4.1 Tools and Techniques for Hazard Identification  

In many cases, to identify safety hazards, a Preliminary Hazard List (PHL) and the required  Hazard Analysis Worksheet (HAW) will suffice.  If an additional means to identify hazards and  compare solutions is required, select the methodology that is most appropriate for the type of  system being evaluated.  The Service Center and/or an AJI SCL can provide additional  guidance on which tool(s) to use for various types of NAS changes.  

When selecting hazard identification/analysis tools, it is important to consider:  

   The necessary information and its availability;     The timeliness of the necessary information;     The amount of time required to conduct the analysis; and     The tool that will provide the appropriate systematic approach for:  o  Identifying the greatest number of relevant hazards,  o  Identifying the causes of the hazards,  o  Predicting the effects associated with the hazards, and  o  Assisting in identifying and recommending risk management strategies.

# 3.7.5 Developing a HAW  

When hazards are identified, the  HAW  is required as part of the ATO SRM process.   It is a tool  used to provide an initial overview of the hazard’s presence in the overall flow of the operation  and is used both for Operations and Second-Level Engineering.  When developing the HAW, it  is crucial to consider the hazards inherent to all aspects of an operation without regard to risk.   ATO safety professionals use the HAW in nearly all risk management applications, except in the  most time-critical situations.  

Using the HAW helps panels overcome the tendency to focus on safety risk in one aspect of an  operation and overlook more serious issues elsewhere in the operation.  Its broad scope guides  the identification of issues that may require analysis and assessment with more detailed hazard  identification tools.  Refer to Annex A for a description of the expected contents of the HAW.  

# 3.7.6 Causes and System State Defined  

Identify and document potential safety issues, their possible causes, and the conditions under  which the safety issues are revealed (i.e., the system state).  

A  cause  is the origin of a hazard.  Causes are events occurring independently or in combination  that result in a hazard.  Causes include, but are not limited to, human error, latent failure, active  failure, design flaw, component failure, and software error.  

A  system state  is the expression of the various conditions, characterized by quantities or  qualities, in which a system can exist.  It is important to capture the system state that most  exposes a hazard, while remaining within the confines of any operational conditions and  assumptions defined in existing documentation.   Assumptions  are conclusions based on the  presumed condition of a system or system state—not documented facts, desired outcomes, or  mitigations.  The system state can be described using a combination of, but not limited to, the  following terms:  

   Operational and Procedural:  VFR versus IFR, simultaneous procedures versus visual  approach procedures, etc.     Conditional:  Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) versus Visual Meteorological  Conditions (VMC), peak traffic versus low traffic, etc.     Physical:  Electromagnetic environment effects, precipitation, primary power source  versus back-up power source, closed runways versus open runways, dry runways  versus contaminated runways, environmental conditions, etc.  

Risk analyses and assessments must consider all possibilities while allowing for all system  states.  During the SRM process, the SRM panel must consider the probability of the identified  system state(s) when determining the likelihood of a hazard’s effect(s) and use that  determination consistently throughout the analysis.  Any given hazard may have a different risk  level in each possible system state.  

# 3.7.7 Addressing Hazards that Cross FAA LOBs  

FAA Order 8040.4 provides risk management policy to follow when hazards, risks, and  associated SRM affect multiple LOBs.  The ATO must consider and, when necessary, use the  provisions in this order when coordinating SRM with other FAA organizations.  AJI will function  as the ATO liaison to interface with organizations outside of the ATO when the provisions of  FAA Order 8040.4 are invoked.  

# 3.7.8 Hazard Escalation and Reporting  

There may be cases in which the ATO and another FAA organization disagree on key issues  surrounding a NAS change.  The AJI-3 Director and the Safety Management Group, AJI-31,  Manager must be made aware of such NAS changes and must work to determine the  appropriate course of action.  The AJI-3 Director will determine whether such hazards and  issues need to be elevated to an FAA-level mediation process facilitated by the FAA SMS  Committee.  

For more information, refer to the  FAA SMS Hazard Escalation Reporting Process

![](images/f072039526b6fc454d973088723497e140853de654582b3b4bea1357e02a0f56.jpg)  

# 3.8.1 Overview  

An accident or incident rarely results from a single failure or event.  Consequently, risk analysis  is seldom a binary (e.g., on/off, open/closed, or broken/operational) process.  Risk analyses can  identify failures from primary, secondary, or even tertiary events.  

During the risk analysis phase:  

   Evaluate each hazard (identified during the “Identify Hazards” phase) and the system  state (from the “Describe the System” and “Identify Hazards” phases) to determine the  controls,     Analyze how the operation would function should the hazard occur, and     Determine the hazard’s associated severity and likelihood and provide supporting  rationale.  

# 3.8.2 Controls  

A  control  is any means currently reducing a hazard’s causes or effects.  Policies, procedures,  hardware, software, or other tools can only be considered controls if they are part of the  operating NAS and have demonstrated effectiveness.  Understanding controls affects the ability  to determine credible effects.  Certain controls may only be in place in certain operating  environments or under certain system states.  Do not document safety requirements as  controls; safety requirements are planned or proposed ways to reduce risk.  Refer to  Section 3.10.3  for information about documenting safety requirements.  

Provide supporting data and/or a rationale that confirms the control’s use, applicability, and  availability related to the hazard.  For instance, if orders are identified as controls, cite the  specific version, paragraph, and/or section number(s).  Alternatively, if equipment is identified as  a control, discuss how it reduces or manages the risk.  Only document the controls associated  with the NAS change under evaluation.  When considering existing hazards identified through  safety audits or post-event risk analyses, consider any control(s) that either minimized the  hazard’s effect or failed.  

Table 3.2  provides broad examples of controls.  This is not a comprehensive list of controls;  each identified control should be directly applicable to the hazard being addressed.  

![Table 3.2: Examples of Controls  ](images/656030f15ba1ec581d40f974c487255c09a4612d4744c3fbdfb25c7a02483a43.jpg)  

#  

Effect  refers to the real or credible harmful outcome that has occurred or can be expected to  occur if the hazard occurs in the defined system state.  A single hazard can have multiple  effects.   Credible  means that it is reasonable to expect that the assumed combination of  conditions that define the system state will occur within the operational lifetime of a typical ATC  system (i.e., 30 years)  Credible effects should be determined with respect to controls.   Document all identified credible effects.  

Often, there is confusion when distinguishing the  possible   effects of a hazard from the  credible   effects; possible is not necessarily the same as credible.  The credibility of an effect is a  nuanced and key consideration in the analysis.  A thorough understanding of this concept can  save time in determining the risk level of a specific hazard.  When determining the credibility of  the effect, it is important to:  

   Recall and Understand the Defenses in Depth Model.   It is well established that  incidents and accidents cannot typically be attributed to a single failure, or even to a  single individual.  Rather, aviation safety issues are the end result of a number of failures  (causes or failures).  Based on this model (see  Section 2.5.1 ), it is critical to consider the  defenses that already exist in the NAS when deciding the credibility of an effect.      Review History.   Check the historical record.  Have there been similar NAS changes?   What happened?  How does the experience gained from the activities affect the  credibility of the outcomes that have been identified for the NAS change?     Rely on Quantitative Data.    Section 3.8.4.3.3  and  Section 3.8.4.3.4  discuss the use of  quantitative and qualitative data, respectively.  Do the quantitative data support the  credibility of the outcomes identified?  If so, the hazard severity determination can be  based on statistical data, and the determinations of the SRM panel members will be  more objective.   Section 7  provides additional information about the aviation safety  databases available for gathering data.  

   Visualize the Occurrence of the Accident or Incident.   Put the hazard in its proper  context within the given system state and determine the sequence of events (causes)  that could lead to the worst credible outcome.  Given that the ATO strives to build  error-tolerant systems (in accordance with the Defenses in Depth Model), consider how  many controls (redundancies, procedures, warning devices, equipment, etc.) would have  to fail for an identified hazard to breach every defense to result in a catastrophic event.   Is it credible to expect that the necessary combination of extreme conditions will  simultaneously occur within the operational lifetime of the system?  

# 3.8.4 Defining Risk  

# 3.8.4.1 How to Define and Determine Risk  

Risk  is the composite of predicted severity and likelihood of the potential effect of a hazard.   While the worst credible effect may present the highest severity, the likelihood of this effect is  often very low.  A less severe effect may occur more frequently and therefore present a higher  overall risk than the more severe effect.  The ways to reduce the risk for the two effects may be  different, and both must be identified.  Consider all credible effects and their associated risks in  order to identify the highest risk for the safety hazard.  

Attempt to obtain and document objective evidence (e.g., historical evidence of similar NAS  changes, testing data, modeling, or simulation results) to support the assessed level of risk.  If  quantitative data are not available, document the research methods—including the data sources  reviewed—in addition to qualitative risk assessments.  Because different system states can  affect both severity and likelihood in unique ways, determine whether the hazard will exist in  several system states and analyze the risk accordingly.  

# 3.8.4.2 Determining Severity  

Severity  is the consequence or impact of a hazard’s effect or outcome in terms of degree of  loss or harm.    It is independent of likelihood and must be determined before likelihood is  calculated.  Determine the severity of each effect, considering the controls while doing so.  For  each effect, use the severity measure yielding the most conservative estimate (i.e., the highest  credible severity).   Table 3.3  is the severity table used by the ATO to help determine the  severity of a hazard when performing SRM.  Provide a rationale for the chosen severity level in  the HAW.  When a NAS change crosses FAA LOBs, consult with the affected parties; the  provisions of FAA Order 8040.4 apply.

a.  Proximity.   Failure transition point of 50 percent or less of required separation.  

b.  Rate of Closure.   Failure transition point greater than 205 knots or 2,000 feet per  minute (consider both aspects and utilize the higher of the two if only one lies above  the transition point).  

d.  Pilot Mitigation.   Pilot executed ATC mitigation in a timely manner.  4. An effect categorized as catastrophic is one that results in at least one fatality or fatal  injury.  5. Ground Collision.  An airplane on the ground collides with an object or person.  6. Minor Injury.  Any injury that is neither fatal nor serious.  7. Serious Injury.  Any injury that:  a. Requires hospitalization for more than 48 hours, commencing within seven days  from the date the injury was received;  b. Results in a fracture of any bone (except simple fractures of fingers, toes, or nose);  c. Causes severe hemorrhages, nerve, muscle, or tendon damage;  d. Involves any internal organ; or  e. Involves second- or third-degree burns, or any burns affecting more than five percent  of the body’s surface.  8. Fatal Injury.  Any injury that results in death within 30 days of the accident.   9.

NMAC definitions are derived from FAA Order 8900.1,  Flight Standards Information  Management System,  Volume 7, Investigation, which defines the following categories:  critical, potential, and low potential.  Refer to Section 8 for the complete definitions of  these categories.  

# 3.8.4.2.1 Determining Severity of NAS Equipment Hazard Effects  

SRM must be conducted throughout the AMS lifecycle in accordance with the SRMGSA and  AMS policy on the  FAA Acquisition System Toolset website .  As such, the inherent functional  severity of certain NAS equipment hazard effects has been analyzed and assessed.  

When performing SRM on NAS equipment that was previously evaluated, it is recommended to  use the data, methodology, and results of the previous work as the starting point for the new risk  analysis.  If there are differences in functionality between the original system and the system  undergoing analysis, the differences should be accounted for and documented in the new risk  analysis.  

In general, NAS equipment can fail such that one of two effects is expected:  

   Loss of Function.   The service is no longer provided.     Malfunction.   The service is being provided inaccurately or with diminished integrity.  

When identifying functional failures that lead to hazards, the loss of function and the malfunction  of constituent parts must be considered.  The severity of malfunctions and losses of function  from infrastructure systems, such as telecommunications and power systems, is dependent  upon the services they support.  

Examples of the systems that provide services include, but are not limited to, the following:  

# Navigation (NAV)  

   Instrument approach systems : Localizer, glide slope (e.g., visual glide slope indicators,  such as Precision Approach Path Indicator and Visual Approach Slope Indicator),  Ground-Based Augmentation System, markers, approach lights, Distance Measuring  Equipment, Localizer-Type Directional Aid, and Runway Visual Range     En Route guidance systems : Very-High Frequency Omnidirectional-Range Radio,  Tactical Air Navigation, Distance Measuring Equipment, and Wide-Area Augmentation  System  

# Communication (COMM)  

   Air-to-ground COMM : Headsets/microphones, speakers, voice switches, radio control  equipment, and radios     Ground-to-ground COMM : Headsets/microphones, speakers, and voice switches  

# Surveillance  

   Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B), Airport Movement Area Safety  System (AMASS), Automated Radar Terminal System (ARTS), Airport Surface  Detection Equipment (ASDE), Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR), Air Traffic Control  Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS), Mode Select Beacon System (MODES), Wide Area  Multilateration (WAM), and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement  System (STARS)  

# Weather  

   Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), Automated Weather Observing System  (AWOS), Low-Level Wind Shear Alert System, Flight Service Automation System,  Operations and Supportability Implementation System, Next Generation Weather Radar,  Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, Weather and Radar Processor, and Weather  Message Switching Center Replacement  

# 3.8.4.2.2 Using the NAS Equipment Worst Credible Severity Table  

When determining the severity of hazards related to NAS equipment, use the “NAS Equipment”  row in  Table 3.3  in conjunction with   Table 3.4 .  Table 3.4, the NAS Equipment Worst Credible  Severity Table, is the starting point for determining severity of NAS equipment.  The severity of  hazards that result from specific equipment changes may be lower or higher than the worst case  presented in Table 3.4 due to the possible controls that limit exposure or the interactions and  dependencies that exist with other systems.  Losses in equipment functionality and equipment  malfunctions may not necessarily be traceable to a loss in separation; therefore, losses of  separation should be addressed independently.  

The severity levels in Table 3.4 are derived from the operational safety assessments and other  documentation produced during initial safety assessments completed as part of the AMS  processes that define severity based on the inherent functionality of systems.  References to  high or low traffic are relative indications during a period of time at any given facility.  

![Table 3.4: NAS Equipment Worst Credible Severity Table 7 ](images/d06406f5fab6ff4ab0e8b5411ee4b3d227dc7f83780279093846dd3562482ca3.jpg)  
7.  Risk should be determined with regard to its operational impact on the provision of air traffic management and/or  communication, navigation, and surveillance services.

# 3.8.4.3 Determining Likelihood  

# 3.8.4.3.1 Likelihood versus Frequency  

Likelihood  is defined as the estimated probability or frequency, in quantitative or qualitative  terms, of a hazard’s effect or outcome.    More specifically, the concept of likelihood can be  separated into two components: likelihood/probability and frequency.   Frequency  is an  expression of how often a given effect occurs; it is a known value determined (for example) by  monitoring a hazard and its effects to identify initial, current, or residual risk (see  Section 4.3.1   and  Section 4.3.4 ).  Conversely, likelihood is an expression of the probability of a hazard’s  effects occurring (i.e., a rate of how often a given effect is expected to occur), which is used to  estimate initial and predicted residual risk.  Provide a rationale for likelihood estimations in the  HAW.  

# 3.8.4.3.2 What to Consider When Defining Likelihood  

# Frequency and Modeling  

Frequency is sometimes used to help estimate likelihood, but historical data do not always  represent future conditions.  Historical frequency may be zero for a given procedure, but that  does not mean that the future likelihood is also zero.  For example, a facility may conduct a  procedure that has unreported incidents that could lead to an undesirable outcome, such as a  loss of separation or a collision.  Likewise, a facility may not have encountered the scenario or  system state that exposes the more severe outcome.  Consider all potential effects that are  derived from indicators of the operation in all credible scenarios.  This practice is required to  challenge the philosophy of, “It has not happened in the past, so it will not happen in the future.”  

When possible, use modeling to examine the effects of hazards that are too rare to have  significant historical statistical data available.   If modeling is required and data are available,  the risk analysis should be based on statistical or observational data (e.g., radar tracks).  Where  there are insufficient data to construct statistical risk assessments, input from SRM panel  members and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) can be used.  This means that if the true rate of a  particular type of operation is unknown, it can be estimated using expert judgment.  It is  important to note that complex proposed NAS changes, such as changes to separation  standards, require quantitative data to support the associated risk analysis.  

# Credible Effects and Controls  

Analyze the likelihood of all credible effects to: (1) Determine the highest potential risk and  (2) Identify all system states that expose the risk.  Remember that less severe effects may occur  more frequently, producing a higher risk; this is why it is important to determine the likelihood of  all credible effects.  Consider controls when determining likelihood because they may minimize  the likelihood of an effect.  

# Crossing FAA LOBs  

When a NAS change crosses FAA LOBs, consult with the affected parties; the provisions of  FAA Order 8040.4 apply.  

# 3.8.4.3.3 Calculating Likelihood with Quantitative Data  

Once the credible effects and the estimated rates of occurrence have been determined, it is  possible to calculate a likelihood rating.  The  Operations Network database  is the official source  of NAS air traffic operations data.  

To estimate the likelihood, first determine the expected number of times the credible effect will  occur (i.e., the number of times that the hazard will occur in the system state that will expose the  risk).  Then, divide that value by the number of ATO operations, flight hours, or operational  hours in which the effect is exposed (i.e., the number of ATO operations, flight hours, or  operational hours affected by the proposed NAS change or the existing hazard).  Finally,  compare the result of this calculation (presented below) to the ranges presented in  Table 3.5  to  determine the likelihood rating.  

#  $=$  

Identify which likelihood unit to use to analyze the effect’s maximum exposure rate (i.e., the  number of ATO operations, flight hours, or operational hours).  For example, for the following  environments, the number of ATO operations will often be the most appropriate likelihood unit to  use when analyzing the exposure of an effect: a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON)  facility; ARTCC with small, busy sectors; or an ATCT.  However, when determining occurrences  of an effect in the Oceanic domain or for an ARTCC with a larger sector, often the number of  flight hours may be more appropriate.  System acquisitions or modifications will use units of  operational hours.  Whether the NAS change applies to a single facility or to an entire NAS  domain, it is important to use the relevant number of ATO operations in which the hazard may  occur when calculating likelihood.  

![Table 3.5: Likelihood of the Effect Standards – ATO Operations and NAS Equipment  ](images/8929fe1fcab677773cf57ca3c30c22333cdc5b0c0359f19704afdb75130a4bc6.jpg)  

The values in Table 3.5 are derived from an analysis of historical ATC data mapped to the  established engineering standard ( Advisory Circular 25.1309-1,  System Design and Analysis )  and can be applied to both ATC and Flight Procedures.  The ratios binding each expected  occurrence rate range were determined through calculations made using ten years of aviation  data.  In each calculation, the numerator was the number of occurrences of a given severity  level occurring during a ten-year period, as obtained from various relevant databases.  The  denominator was the number of ATO operations (or flight hours) in that ten-year period, as  obtained through the Operations Network database or the National Transportation Safety Board  database.  The value was adjusted to reflect a forecasted air traffic increase.  A cut-off point of   $10^{\cdot14}$   was established to define the boundaries of credible events for the purposes of calculating  likelihood.   Figure 3.6  depicts the likelihood continuum and the expected occurrence rate  ranges.  

![](images/d34f1e4c7f0d3641ac2790b2e8e37a735d2a7aa2248c0582e3b834d0d6f71df3.jpg)  
Figure 3.6: Likelihood Continuum  

# 3.8.4.3.4 Determining Likelihood When No Data Are Available  

For some NAS changes, the necessary data are not available.  There may not be a similar  enough change/procedure/situation in the NAS to provide similar data from which to estimate a  rate of occurrence.  When unable to use modeling, SME input can be utilized by SRM panel  members to provide a qualitative approach to determine likelihood.  This approach is only  recommended when all avenues of data collection have been exhausted or when the change  proponent is attempting to implement a new operation for which no data exist.  For a majority of  changes to the NAS, data from a similar NAS change may be collected and analyzed to  determine the number of expected occurrences of an effect.  

Table 3.6  presents calendar-based approximations of NAS-wide effect occurrences.  This table  only applies if the proposed NAS change or existing hazard affects all ATO operations in a  particular air traffic domain.

# 3.9 DIAAT Phase 4: Assess Risk  

![](images/803d142c08aa9f2ea8b75be9b57a14f94adaeb730a9f1a848a5b614bd9671f12.jpg)  

# 3.9.1 Overview  

In this phase, identify each hazard’s associated initial risk and plot each hazard on a risk matrix.  

When assessing and mitigating safety risk, first determine the risk level prior to the  implementation of any safety requirements (see  Section 3.10.3 ).   Initial risk  describes the  

composite of the severity and likelihood of a hazard’s effect, considering only controls and  documented assumptions for a given system state.  It describes the risk before any of the  proposed mitigations are implemented.  

When analyzing and assessing NAS equipment or existing hazards, the initial risk may be  equated to the  current risk , which is defined as the composite of severity and frequency of a  hazard’s effects in the present state.  

# 3.9.2 Risk Levels and Definitions  

Record all hazards and their associated risk levels.  Hazards are assigned one of three risk  levels: high, medium, or low.  The ATO and its employees are responsible for identifying and  mitigating hazards with unacceptable risk (i.e., high risk).  Likewise, the ATO should determine if  hazards with acceptable risk (i.e., medium and low risk) can be further mitigated.  

# 3.9.2.1 High Risk  

This is unacceptable risk, and the NAS change cannot be implemented unless the hazard’s  associated risk is mitigated to medium or low.  Existing high-risk hazards also must be reduced  to medium- or low-risk hazards.  The predicted residual risk must be monitored and tracked in  relation to the safety performance targets.  The predicted residual risk must be confirmed with  objective evidence suggesting an impact to the hazard’s causes or effects.  

Hazards with catastrophic effects that are caused by single point failures, common cause  failures, or undetectable latent events in combination with single point or common cause failures  are considered high risk, even if the possibility of occurrence is extremely improbable.  

When a system has a  single point failure , there is a failure of one independent element of the  system that causes or could cause the whole system to fail.  The system does not have a  back-up, redundancy, or alternative procedure to compensate for the failed component.  An  example of a single point failure is found in a system with redundant hardware, in which both  pieces of hardware rely on the same battery for power.  In this case, if the battery fails, the  entire system will fail.  

A  common cause failure  is a failure that occurs when a single fault results in the  corresponding failure of multiple system components or functions.  An example of a common  cause failure is found in a system with redundant computers running on the same software,  which is susceptible to the same software bugs.  

# 3.9.2.2 Medium Risk  

Although initial medium risk is acceptable, it is recommended and desirable that safety  requirements be developed to reduce severity and/or likelihood.  The risk must be monitored  and tracked in relation to the safety performance targets.  The predicted residual risk must be  confirmed with objective evidence suggesting an impact to the hazard’s causes or effects.   Refer to  Section 4.2  for information on monitoring.  

A catastrophic severity and corresponding extremely improbable likelihood qualify as medium  risk, provided that the effect is not the result of a single point or common cause failure.  If the  cause is a single point or common cause failure, the hazard is categorized as high risk.  

# 3.9.2.3 Low Risk  

This is acceptable risk without restriction or limitation.  It is not mandatory to develop safety  requirements for low-risk hazards; however, develop a monitoring plan with at least one safety  performance target.  

# 3.9.3 Plotting Risk for Each Hazard  

The risk matrix shown in  Figure 3.7  is used to determine risk levels.  Plotting the risk for each  hazard on the matrix helps to prioritize treatment.  The rows in the matrix reflect the likelihood  categories, and the columns reflect the severity categories.  Adhere to the following guidelines  when plotting risk for each hazard:  

• Plot a hazard’s risk according to its associated severity and likelihood. • To plot the risk for a hazard on the risk matrix, select the appropriate severity column (based on the severity definitions in  Table 3.3 ) and move down to the appropriate likelihood row (based on the likelihood definitions used from either  Table 3.5  or Table 3.6 ). • Plot the hazard in the box where the severity and likelihood of the effect associated with the hazard intersect. • If the plotted box is red, the risk associated with the hazard is high; if the box is yellow, the risk associated with the hazard is medium; and if the box is green, the risk associated with the hazard is low.  As shown in the split cell in the bottom right corner of the matrix, hazards with a catastrophic severity and extremely improbable likelihood can be medium or high risk, depending on the cause, as explained in  Section 3.9.2.1 .  

Use this SMS Manual and the risk matrix in  Figure 3.7  for all SRM panels in which the ATO  accepts the risk.  When an FAA LOB other than the ATO is required to accept the safety risk,  FAA Order 8040.4, and the risk matrices therein, apply.  FAA Order 8040.4 also applies with  regard to acceptability of risk levels at the agency level when crossing LOBs.

# 3.10 DIAAT Phase 5: Treat Risk  

Choose risk management strategies  Develop safety performance targets  Develop monitoring plan  

# 3.10.1 Overview  

In this phase, identify appropriate means to mitigate or manage the safety risk.  Treating risk  involves:  

 Identifying appropriate safety requirements,  Defining safety performance targets or a sound alternate method to verify the predicted residual risk for each hazard, and  Developing a monitoring plan that prescribes tasks and review cycles for comparing the current risk to the predicted residual risk.  

# 3.10.2 Risk Management Strategies  

To address safety risk, identify and evaluate means that either manage the risk or reduce it to  an acceptable level.  The four risk management strategies are risk control, risk avoidance, risk  transfer, and risk assumption.  Assess how the proposed risk management strategy affects the  overall risk.  Consider using a combination of actions to best manage or reduce the risk to an  acceptable level.   When determining the appropriate strategy, consider how the safety  performance target (see  Section 4.1 ) will be used to evaluate the safety performance of the  chosen course of action.  

# 3.10.2.1 Risk Control  

A  risk control   strategy  involves the development of  safety requirements , defined as planned  or proposed means to reduce a hazard’s causes or effects.  Examples include policies or  procedures, redundant systems and/or components, and alternate sources of production.  Refer  to  Section 3.10.3  for information on documenting safety requirements.  

An explanation of how a safety requirement reduced the hazard’s risk level—ultimately  supported with objective evidence through testing, monitoring, or another method—must be  provided for each safety requirement.  All safety requirements that are implemented and are  determined to have successfully addressed the hazard or safety issue become part of the  operating NAS.  At that time, they will be considered controls that form the basis for future SRM  efforts.  Refer to  Section 3.8.2  for information on controls.  

# 3.10.2.2 Risk Avoidance  

The  risk avoidance   strategy  averts the potential occurrence and/or consequence of a hazard  by either selecting a different approach or not implementing a specific proposal.  This technique  may be pursued when multiple alternatives or options are available, such as determining where  to construct an ATCT.  In some cases, a decision may be made to limit the NAS change to  certain conditions or system states, thereby avoiding the risk associated with other conditions.   An example of this is allowing simultaneous operations on one runway that is overflown by three  other runway flight paths.  It may be discovered that the risk associated with the simultaneous  operation can be mitigated to an acceptable level for two of the runways but not for the third.  It  may be decided that aircraft will not be allowed to operate on the third runway while  simultaneously landing on the crossing runway, thereby avoiding risk.  

A Comparative Safety Assessment (CSA) may be used when multiple systems or procedures  are available.   If one alternative cannot be mitigated to an acceptable level, then another  system, method, or procedure may be chosen.  When no alternatives are available, the risk  avoidance strategy is more likely to be used as the basis for a “go” or “no-go” decision at the  start of an operation or program.  Risk must be avoided from the perspective of all affected  stakeholders.  Thus, an avoidance strategy is one that involves all of the stakeholders  associated with the proposed NAS change.  

# 3.10.2.3 Risk Transfer  

The  risk transfer strategy  shifts the ownership of risk to another party; the recipient may be  better equipped to mitigate the risk at the operational or organizational level.  Organizations  transfer risk primarily to assign responsibility to the organization or operation most capable of  managing it.  The recipient must accept the risk, and the transfer must then be documented  (e.g., through a Letter of Agreement or Memorandum of Agreement).  

Examples of risk transfer may include:  

 The transfer of aircraft separation responsibility in applying visual separation from the air traffic controller to the pilot,  

 The development of new policies or procedures to change ownership of a NAS component to a more appropriate organization,  The procurement of contracts for specialized tasks from more appropriate sources (e.g., contract maintenance), and  The transfer of ATC systems from the acquisition organization to the organization that provides maintenance.  

Transfer of risk cannot be the only method used to treat a high-risk hazard.  Identify safety  requirements to lower the safety risk to medium or low before it can be accepted in the NAS.  All  transferred risks must be monitored until the predicted residual risk is verified by the appropriate  organization.  

# 3.10.2.4 Risk Assumption  

The  risk assumption   strategy  simply means accepting the risk.  The risk acceptor assumes  responsibility for the risk as it is.  When a risk acceptor agrees to implement a NAS change,  they agree to implement it based on the predicted residual risk being medium or low and  assume responsibility for the risk.  When this management strategy is used, the predicted  residual risk is derived from the controls.  Under this strategy, controls serve as the basis on  which safety performance targets or alternate methods to verify predicted residual risk are  developed.   It is recommended and desirable that safety requirements be developed to further  mitigate risk or reduce likelihood or severity.  

It is not permissible to use a risk assumption strategy to treat an initial or current high risk  associated with a hazard.  The predicted residual risk for initial high-risk hazards must be  medium or low before it can be accepted into the NAS.  

# 3.10.3 Documenting Safety Requirements  

All safety requirements identified by the SRM panel attendees and included in the HAW are  considered to be recommendations for review and approval by the appropriate signatories.   After appropriate means of managing risk have been developed and documented, management  officials may identify the effect of safety requirements on other organizations and coordinate  with the affected organizations.  

If any safety requirement affects the safe provision of air traffic management services, it may be  necessary for the safety requirement to undergo the SRM process to determine its effect on the  NAS.  

Refer to  Section 5.3  for more information on safety requirements’ approval and implementation  decision-making and signatures.  

# 3.10.4 Determining Predicted Residual Risk  

Predicted residual risk  is the risk that is estimated to exist after the safety requirements are  implemented or after all avenues of risk mitigation have been explored.  The predicted residual  risk is based on the assumption that controls are in place and/or all safety requirements are  implemented and are valid.  If safety requirements are not documented in the HAW, predicted  residual risk should be the same as the initial risk.  

If the risk cannot be reduced to an acceptable level after attempting all possible risk reduction  strategies, either revise the original objectives or abandon the proposed NAS change.  If an  acceptable proposal is not identified, the NAS change cannot be implemented.  Similarly, if a  

NAS change was implemented without safety requirements and the predicted residual risk was  not met, refer to  Section 4.3.2  for more information.  

# 4.1 Developing Safety Performance Targets  

Safety performance targets 1   are measurable goals used to verify the predicted residual risk of  a hazard.  A safety performance target is the preferred means to relate the performance of risk  reduction efforts to the expected risk level.  The safety performance target is included as part of  the monitoring plan (see  Section 4.2 ).  

Safety performance targets are used to assess safety performance with respect to controls and  newly implemented safety requirements.  Do not define the worst credible effect or effects  producing the highest risk level as the safety performance target; instead, look at the less  severe effects or indicators (e.g., the number of unauthorized vehicle deviations on taxiways per  a specific number of airport operations over a period of time).  Safety performance targets  should be related to the hazard or National Airspace System (NAS) change.  

When developing safety performance targets, the Safety Risk Management (SRM) panel  attendees should apply the data used during the “Analyze Risk” phase to determine the  appropriate metrics to monitor.  If there is no established data source to support a proposed  safety performance target, then a means to begin collecting the data should be identified and  documented as a safety requirement.  Data used during the SRM process also serve as the  basis for comparison against the post-implementation metrics.  

Mapping a hazard to a specific safety performance target may not be possible in terms of  establishing a causal relationship.  In such cases, identify a sound alternate method to verify the  predicted residual risk and determine whether controls and/or safety requirements are  appropriate and functioning as intended.  

It is important to retain objective evidence that the safety requirements have been implemented.  Objective evidence is simply documented proof.  The evidence must not be circumstantial; it  must be obtained through observation, measurement, testing, or other means.  

# 4.2 Developing the Monitoring Plan  

The monitoring plan 2   should be comprehensive enough to verify the predicted residual risk.  The  monitoring plan includes either the safety performance targets or another sound method for  verifying the predicted residual risk.  The SRM panel should create a plan for each hazard that  defines:  

 Monitoring activities;  The frequency and duration of tracking monitoring results; and  How to determine, measure, and analyze any adverse effects on adjoining systems.  

# 4.2.1 Monitoring Activities  

The risk acceptor, or the monitoring Point of Contact (POC) identified by the risk acceptor, must  verify that the controls and/or safety requirements were implemented and are functioning as  designed.  Specifically, this means that procedures must be stringently followed and hardware  or software must function within the established design limits.  

Detail the methods by which the risk acceptor, or the monitoring POC identified by the risk  acceptor, will gather the performance data and monitoring results.  The organization that  

accepted the risk is accountable for ensuring that the monitoring plan is being upheld (i.e., that  the monitoring results are being compared to the defined safety performance targets (or the  results alone are being used) to determine whether predicted residual risk is being met).  Refer  to Section 5.4 for information about risk acceptance.  

# 4.2.2 Frequency and Duration of Monitoring  

When considering the frequency and duration of tracking monitoring results, account for:  

 The complexity of the NAS change,  The hazard’s initial risk level,  How often the hazard’s effect is expected to occur in the defined system state (i.e., likelihood), Controls, The types of safety requirements that are being implemented (if any), and  The amount of time needed to verify the predicted residual risk.  

For example, when considering a hazard associated with the familiarity of a new procedure, a  relatively short tracking period would be required until a person or population could reasonably  be expected to adapt to the new procedure and the predicted residual risk could be verified.   However, the monitoring plan for a hazard associated with new separation criteria may require  several years of tracking to verify the predicted residual risk.  

Refer to Annex A for documentation requirements of a complete monitoring plan for an  individual hazard.  

# 4.3 Post-SRM Monitoring  

It is critical to obtain feedback on safety performance indicators through continuous monitoring.  Organizations responsible for performing Quality Control and/or Quality Assurance use audits  and assessments to monitor the safety risk and performance of an implemented NAS change  documented in the monitoring plan.  The responsible organization determines whether an  implemented NAS change is meeting the safety performance targets documented in the  monitoring plan.  

Results of post-implementation monitoring help determine whether a change can be made part  of the operating NAS or must be readdressed through the SRM process.  

# 4.3.1 Monitoring and Current Risk  

A hazard’s current risk is updated at each monitoring interval (in accordance with stated  monitoring frequency).  Current risk provides an indicator of whether safety requirements are  meeting the predicted residual risk.  The risk acceptor is accountable for ensuring that the  monitoring plan is being upheld and that monitoring reports, as dictated by the monitoring  frequency, are being analyzed to determine whether the safety performance targets are  being met.  

# 4.3.2 Predicted Residual Risk Is Not Met  

Through monitoring current risk and the safety performance of a recently implemented NAS  change, it may become clear that the predicted residual risk is not being met.  If this occurs,  notify the risk acceptor.  The risk acceptor may choose to accept the current risk as the new  

predicted residual risk or to reconvene the SRM panel for additional safety requirement  considerations.  In either case, the SRM document must be revised with the new safety  requirements (if identified) and new predicted residual risk, and approval and risk  acceptance signatures must be reobtained (refer to  Section 5.4.1  for information on risk  acceptance authority).  

There are several reasons why the predicted residual risk may not be met:  

 The safety requirements or controls may not be properly mitigating the risk,  The initial risk may have been analyzed inaccurately,  Unintended consequences may have occurred, or  New hazards may have been identified.  

Refer to  Section 5.7  for information on updating SRM documentation.  

# 4.3.3 Predicted Residual Risk Is Met  

The successful completion of monitoring is a prerequisite to hazard and NAS change closeout.  This includes the achievement of safety performance targets and/or the predicted residual risk.  

The monitoring procedures used to verify the predicted residual risk must also be documented,  as they will be used to evaluate the safety performance of the change after it is added to the  operating NAS.  The established monitoring requirements must be followed, even after meeting  the goals of the monitoring plan.  

# 4.3.4 Residual Risk  

Residual risk  is the level of risk that has been verified by completing a thorough monitoring  plan with an achieved measurable safety performance target(s).  It is the composite of the  severity of a hazard’s effect and the frequency of the effect’s occurrence.  

# 4.3.5 Monitoring and Tracking of Changes Added to the Operating NAS  

A change is considered part of the operating NAS only after monitoring through existing Safety  Assurance processes is completed, the safety performance target is achieved and maintained,  and/or the predicted residual risk is verified.  The NAS change and all the associated safety  requirements become part of the operating NAS, which will become the basis from which all  future NAS changes will be measured.  If a safety requirement is altered or removed from a  NAS change that was made part of the operating NAS, SRM must be performed.  

The documentation that was developed during the SRM process is critical to Safety Assurance  functions, which often use SRM documents as inputs to assessments and evaluations.  

# 5.1 Risk Acceptance and Approval  

The review and approval of Safety Risk Management (SRM) documents and acceptance of any  safety risk is designed to maintain and assure the quality of Air Traffic Organization (ATO) risk  management activities.  There are key variables that affect safety risk acceptance and SRM  documentation review and signature requirements.  They include the organization(s) affected by  the proposed National Airspace System (NAS) change, the organization that developed the  document, the risk(s) associated with the NAS change, and whether the NAS change is  considered national or local in scope.  There are several signature authorities associated with  SRM documentation: concurrence, approval, risk acceptance, and safety requirement  implementation.  Refer to  Section 5.2  for information regarding nationally and locally scoped  changes.  

For guidance on specific signature types, refer to  Sections 5.3  through  5.6 .   Tables 5.1  through  5.4  summarize the SRM document signature requirements.  The terms “affected facilities” and  “affected Service Units” refer to the facilities or organizations that are impacted by the safety risk  associated with the NAS change or existing safety issue.  

Note:  Table 5.1  is not to be used for SRM documents with an unacceptable (high) predicted  residual risk (see  Table 5.4 ).

# 5.2 Scope of NAS Changes  

NAS changes are considered either local or national.  A national NAS change is one for which  an AJI Safety Case Lead (SCL) facilitates or leads the SRM effort or that meets at least one of  the following criteria:  

   The NAS change has high visibility or a potential political, economic, or financial impact  to the FAA, the NAS, or the flying public.      The NAS change is the result of financial or operational decisions made by FAA  executive management, Cabinet-level executives, or Congress.     The NAS change includes means to reduce any safety risk identified as part of the Top 5  Program.     The NAS change modifies safety policy that must be incorporated into a directive.     The NAS change could or does present operational or technical conflicts to multiple  affected Service Units or FAA LOBs.     The NAS change will be implemented on a national level, affecting multiple facilities.  

Note: There may be cases in which an AJI SCL facilitates a local SRM panel and none of the  aforementioned criteria apply.  These changes will be considered local.  

A NAS change is considered to be local if:  

   It does not meet any of the preceding criteria and it affects three or fewer Service  Delivery Points within a single Service Area, or     It is a change proposed by Technical Operations that involves a single piece of  equipment that is restricted to one district.  

In cases where a NAS change affects two adjacent Service Delivery Points in different Service  Areas or a single Terminal Radar Approach Control / Air Route Traffic Control Center with more  than two underlying Airport Traffic Control Towers, the change proponent has the authority to  determine if the change will be considered local or national in scope.  

Note: Many systems and facilities that provide service in the NAS are not procured, owned, or  maintained by the FAA or another federal entity.  The FAA has the authority and responsibility to  assure the safety of these services in accordance with Title 49 of the United States Code  Section 44505,  Systems, procedures, facilities, and devices , and Title 14 of the Code of Federal  Regulations Part 171, NON-FEDERAL NAVIGATION FACILITIES.  Although a system/service  may not be procured by the FAA, implementation into the NAS is considered a NAS change and  requires appropriate SRM as if the FAA were acquiring the system/service.  

# 5.2.1 Local Implementation of National NAS Changes  

When the local implementation of a nationally scoped SRM document cannot follow the national  standard, local SRM is required for the local deviations.  If formal waivers are required in such  cases, local SRM does not eliminate the waiver requirement.  

# 5.3 Approving Safety Requirements  

An organization’s safety requirement approval signature represents its commitment to  implementing the safety requirement in accordance with the associated SRM document.  For  acquisition systems, if the approved PRD contains the safety requirements referenced in the  SRM document, no Point of Contact (POC) signature is required.  If the requirements are not  listed in the approved PRD, the SRM document must include a POC signature for each  additional safety requirement.  

# 5.3.1 Appropriate Signatories  

Safety requirement signature authority must be at the managerial level with the ability to fund  and ensure the implementation of the safety requirement.  The appropriate signing official may  be determined by the FAA organization.  When multiple officials are responsible for providing  safety requirements signatures for an SRM document, they must share similar managerial  statuses or responsibilities.  

When an organization outside of the FAA is responsible for a safety requirement, a signature on  file is required.  This requirement may be met through a memorandum or an SRM document.   The change proponent is responsible for following up on the status of the implementation of  safety requirements identified in the SRM document.  

# 5.3.2 Endorsing Implementation of Safety Requirements  

All safety requirements that the SRM panel attendees identify must be accounted for in the SRM  document.  The change proponent and appropriate safety requirement(s) POC(s) must  collaborate to determine which safety requirements will be approved for implementation and  notate that decision in the SRM document.  The risk acceptor is accountable for ensuring that all  approved safety requirements are implemented and all monitoring activities are recorded in  SMTS.  

# 5.3.2.1 Safety Requirements Planned for Implementation  

All safety requirements included in the Hazard Analysis Worksheet (HAW) of the signed SRM  document must be implemented before or in conjunction with the NAS change, even when the  risk is classified as medium or low.  All organizations responsible for implementing a safety  requirement must:  

1. Sign the SRM document for the safety requirement approval,  2. Document the status of the safety requirement (e.g., implemented, not implemented, or  in progress), and  3. Record objective evidence supporting the safety requirement’s implementation.  

Only safety requirements that are to be implemented must have an accompanying signature.  

# 5.3.2.2 Safety Requirements Not Planned for Implementation  

If a safety requirement is not going to be implemented, SRM panel attendees must be contacted  to verify that the predicted residual risk, safety performance target(s), and/or monitoring plan  have not been affected.  If changes are required, the SRM panel attendees must reconvene to  update any impacted section of the SRM document, including the HAW,  and the SRM  document must be revised to include these changes and the rationale for not implementing the  safety requirement.  In addition, if any of the SRM panel members dissent with the removal of  the safety requirement or the resulting changes to the predicted residual risk, safety  performance target(s), and/or monitoring plan, the dissention must be included in the SRM  document.  

# 5.3.3 Safety Recommendations  

Safety recommendations do not rise to the level of safety requirements.  They are not used  when determining predicted residual risk and do not require any endorsement but may be  recorded within the SRM document.  

# 5.4 Risk Acceptance  

Risk acceptance  is confirmation by the appropriate management official that they understand  the safety risk associated with the NAS change or existing safety issue and that they accept that  safety risk into the NAS.  Safety risk must be accepted before the implementation of a proposed  NAS change and the execution of the monitoring plan.  Risk acceptance is based on the  predicted residual risk.  Risk acceptance and other inputs (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) are  necessary before a change to the NAS can be implemented.  When an individual or  organization accepts a risk, it does not mean that the risk is eliminated; some level of risk will  remain.  

Risk acceptance requires:  

   Signed confirmation from the appropriate management official that they understand and  accept the predicted residual safety risk(s) associated with the hazard(s) identified in the  SRM document;     Signatures for the safety requirements identified in the SRM document;     Approval of the safety performance target(s) or alternate method(s) identified to verify  the predicted residual risk associated with each hazard, confirming that the safety  performance target(s) or identified alternate method(s) can be used to measure the  current risk; and     A comprehensive monitoring plan that the risk acceptor agrees to follow to verify the  predicted residual risk.  

For nationally implemented NAS changes, risk can be accepted at the national level.  However,  if a facility is not able to comply with all of the safety requirements or has additional hazards  and/or causes that were not identified in the national SRM document, the facility must perform  SRM (with local risk acceptance) prior to the implementation of the NAS change.  Refer to  Section 5.2.1  for information on local versus national implementation of safety requirements.  

# 5.4.1 Authority to Accept Safety Risk  

The acceptance of the safety risk depends on the span of the program or NAS change and the  associated risk.  The responsibility for risk acceptance ultimately lies with the organization(s)  affected by the NAS change.  Risk acceptance authority also depends on whether a NAS  change is local or national in scope.  

By signing the SRM document, the risk acceptor is confirming the following are understood and  accepted:  

   The identified safety risk(s);     The safety requirements that will be implemented;     The predicted residual risk(s) associated with the hazard(s);     The safety performance target(s) identified to measure the predicted residual risk  associated with each hazard, thus confirming that the safety performance target(s) may  be used to measure the current risk level; and     The information contained in the monitoring plan.  

The risk acceptor is accountable for:  

   Ensuring that all monitoring activities are being recorded in SMTS;     Ensuring that performance data needed for the monitoring activities are being collected  and analyzed to verify that the safety performance target(s) are being met;     Determining the need to reconvene SRM panel attendees 4  or choosing to accept the  current risk as the new predicted residual risk if performance data indicate that the  predicted residual risk is not met and/or if the risk management strategy is proven to be  inadequate; and     Reconvening the SRM panel attendees if a safety requirement identified by the  attendees cannot be implemented.  

# 5.4.2 Risk Acceptance Outside of the ATO  

If the affected party is outside of the ATO (e.g., navigation or weather services), each  organization responsible for establishing requirements for contracted services accepts the risk  into the NAS.  LOBs/organizations outside of the ATO (e.g., Office of Airports, Office of  NextGen, Office of Commercial Space Transportation, or Office of Aviation Safety) are also  responsible for components of the NAS and have a role in accepting safety risk.  

ATO vice presidents, directors, managers, and supervisors must work closely with their  counterparts in LOBs/organizations outside of the ATO to help ensure that the appropriate party  or parties accept and manage any safety risk resulting from NAS changes.  Again, it is not in  compliance with ATO policy to implement a NAS change without having first accepted any  associated safety risk.  Refer to  FAA Order 8040.4,  Safety Risk Management Policy , for policy  on cross-LOB risk acceptance.  

# 5.5 SRM Document Concurrence  

Concurrence  is used to represent a technical review of the SRM document and to confirm the  rationale used throughout is consistent with the SRM process.  The concurrence signature  comes from an SRM expert who is well versed in the ATO SMS Manual and familiar with the  terminology and processes therein.  The concurrence signature is not a required signature;  however, Service Areas, District Offices, or individual facilities may require a concurrence  signature on their respective SRM documents.  

# 5.6 SRM Document Approval  

Approval of an SRM document with hazards  requires and represents that:  

 The SRM document was developed in accordance with policy and guidance;  Hazards were systematically identified using a structured approach;  Risk was appropriately analyzed and assessed;  If identified, safety requirements were deemed valid;  Safety performance targets or other methods to verify predicted residual risk were approved by the responsible Service Unit; and  A monitoring plan was prepared.  

# Approval of an SRM document without hazards  requires and represents that:  

 The SRM document was developed in accordance with policy and guidance,  The NAS change did not introduce new hazards or increase safety risk, and  The SRM document includes a detailed rationale to support the finding of no hazards.  

In approving SRM documentation, the approval authority affirms that the aforementioned items  have been performed and agrees that the underlying assumptions are reasonable and the  findings are complete and accurate.  SRM documentation approval does not constitute approval  for implementation or acceptance of any risk associated with the NAS change or existing safety  issue.  

# 5.6.1  Service Unit SRM Documentation Approval or Concurrence  

Affected or stakeholder Service Units must assign an appropriate management official to  provide approval or concurrence of the SRM document.  The person selected must be available  to provide input to the management official(s) who will accept the risk associated with the NAS  change or existing safety issue.  

If SRM documentation must be sent outside of the Service Unit for approval (to another Service  Unit, another LOB, AJI, or AOV), the documentation must have an approval or concurrence  signature before it leaves the Service Unit.  All identified means to reduce safety risk requiring  approval and acceptance by AOV must first be sent through AJI.  

If SRM documentation requires the approval or concurrence of more than one Service Unit,  discrepancies in the approval standards or processes may exist between the organizations.  In  these cases, the change proponent should request that AJI adjudicate the discrepancies.  

If an AJI SCL managed the development of an SRM document (see  Annex A ), no other Service  Unit concurrence is required; however, the risk acceptor must still review and sign the SRM  

document before the NAS change can be implemented.  If an AJI SCL develops the SRM  document, the relevant/affected operational Service Unit(s) that accepted the associated risks of  the NAS change or existing safety issue must follow the monitoring plan documented in the  SRM document.  

# 5.6.2  AJI Review and Approval  

AJI SCLs verify that the SRM process has been followed, that the safety documentation is  complete, and that the safety documentation adheres to the SMS Manual principles and  guidelines.  

Any documentation forwarded to the AJI-3 Director for approval must first go through an AJI  peer review.  For an AJI peer review, forward SRM documentation to the AJI SCL in draft form  and without signatures.  At this point, the AJI SCL will facilitate the remaining steps in the review  process.  When the SRM document is ready for signature, the AJI SCL will notify the change  proponent, who will obtain the appropriate signatures.  Finally, when the SRM document has all  signatures except for that of the AJI-3 Director, the AJI SCL will present the SRM document to  the Safety Management Group, AJI-31, Manager.  The AJI-31 Group Manager will forward the  SRM document to the AJI-3 Director for signature.  Other SRM document signature  requirements that are documented in this SMS Manual remain.  

When a NAS change or existing safety issue facilitated by AJI crosses FAA LOBs/organizations,  an AJI SCL reviews the SRM document to verify that affected LOBs/organizations have  reviewed and approved the documentation.  In addition, the AJI-3 Director must approve and  sign the SRM document.  

# 5.6.2.1 AJI Participation in System Acquisition SRM  

AJI SCLs will be involved with NAS change efforts from concept development through  In-Service Management.  An AJI SCL will be assigned to a portfolio or program to provide safety  guidance and advice, as appropriate.  The AJI SCL will be familiar with the portfolio or program,  its possible interfaces, its position within the Enterprise Architecture, its milestones, and its  safety documentation requirements.  The AJI SCL will stay with that portfolio or program  throughout its lifecycle.  

The AJI SCL will ensure that all required safety documentation meets the requirements of this  SMS Manual and the SRMGSA and will request subject matter experts to review (i.e., peer  review) certain documentation before it is presented to the AJI-3 Director for approval.  

The AJI-3 Director reviews certain SRM documentation and the associated acquisition safety  assessments, analyses, reports, and plans, providing approval or comments (see the SRMGSA  for information regarding specific documentation reviews and approval requirements).  

# 5.6.3  AOV Approval and Acceptance  

# 5.6.3.1 Items Requiring AOV Approval  

AOV approval  is the formal act of approving of a NAS change submitted by a requesting  organization.  This action is required prior to the proposed NAS change being implemented.   This is not the same as approval of the SRM document itself.  All NAS changes or existing  safety issues submitted to AOV for approval first require approval and concurrence by AJI and  any applicable Service Units.  Refer to  Section 5.6.2  for information on AJI approval.  

The following items require AOV approval before implementation:  

   Controls that are defined to mitigate or eliminate initial and current high-risk hazards.   (For specific guidance regarding the AOV high-risk hazard acceptance/approval process  and modeling requirements, see  FAA Order 8000.365,  Safety Oversight Circulars  (SOC) ;  AOV Safety Oversight Circular (SOC) 07-02,  AOV Concurrence/Approval at  Various Phases of Safety Risk Management Documentation and Mitigations for Initial  High-Risk Hazards ; and  AOV SOC 07-05A,  Guidance on Safety Risk Modeling and  Simulation of Hazards and Mitigations . )     Changes or waivers to provisions of handbooks, orders, and documents that pertain to  separation minima, including  FAA Order JO 7110.65,  Air Traffic Control  (see the ATO  Safety Guidance (ATO-SG) on separation minima)     Waiver renewals pertaining to approved separation     Changes to NAS equipment availability and any changes to the program     Specific ATO-SG documents pertaining to the SMS, as explained in  FAA Order  JO 1030.1,  Air Traffic Organization Safety Guidance  

# 5.6.3.2 Items Requiring AOV Acceptance  

The following require acceptance by AOV:  

   Mitigations to reduce high safety risk to medium or low and/or mitigations that span FAA  LOBs     Exclusions to SMS requirements granted by AJI     Changes to the criteria in  FAA Order 8200.1,  United   States Standard Flight Inspection  Manual ,  including:  o  The flight inspector’s authority and responsibilities  o  Facility status classification and issuance of Notices to Air Missions  o  Records and reports  o  Extensions in the periodicity or interval of inspections  o  Changes in required checklist items for the inspection of specific system areas  o  Changes in established tolerances, or tolerances proposed for new equipment or  new functionality  o  Changes in the procedures for evaluating the safety and flyability of instrument flight  procedures     Changes to the personnel certification requirements     Changes to the certification criteria in  FAA Order 6000.15,  General Maintenance  Handbook for National Airspace System (NAS) Facilities      Changes to the personnel certification requirements in  FAA Order JO 3000.57,  Air  Traffic Organization Technical Operations Training and Personnel Certification  

# 5.6.4 Coordination of SRM Documentation  

AJI will collaborate with AOV to obtain the necessary reviews, approval, and risk acceptance  signatures for SRM documentation with all applicable organizations outside of the ATO for all  NAS changes.  The scope of potential changes includes products, services, systems, and  procedures associated with federal and non-federal facilities.  Service Unit change proponents  may initiate these reviews and signatures through outside ATO organizations.  However, the  Service Unit change proponent must inform the appropriate AJI SCL of such action.  

# 5.7 Revising an SRM Document  

Through post-implementation monitoring, a need to modify the previously approved SRM  document may arise (see  Section 4.3.2 ).  This requires a revision of the SRM document and  new SRM document approval and risk acceptance signatures.  

# Table 5.5: Signature Requirements for SRM Document Revisions (1)  

![](images/b7d517643af54bdd4b0639a17489467a4652c011ce38c5ca6f4ab684a2421941.jpg)  

# Notes:  

(1) If an SRM document revision does not necessitate a new approval/acceptance signature  from AOV, a new signature from the AJI-3 Director is not required.  

The risk acceptor(s), in coordination with the change proponent, may need to update or change  an SRM document as a project progresses and decisions are modified.  Monitoring may indicate  that the NAS change does not meet the predicted residual risk, that the risk management  strategy is less effective than expected, or that additional hazards exist.  In this case, additional  

safety requirements may be necessary.  Any change that may affect the assumptions, hazards,  causes, or estimated risk in an SRM document necessitates a revision, including new  signatures.  A change page (containing a description of each change to the SRM document and  the number of each affected page) must be included with each SRM document.  

Based on the results of external assessments (e.g., Independent Operational Assessments,  Flight Inspections, post-implementation safety assessments, AJI audits and assessments, and  the NAS Technical Evaluation Program), the change proponent may need to reconvene the  SRM panel attendees and update the SRM document as needed.  

# 6.1  Audit and Assessment Programs  

Safety and Technical Training (AJI) Safety Assurance programs evaluate compliance with  Safety Management System (SMS) requirements and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  and/or Air Traffic Organization (ATO) orders, standards, policies, and directives.  Findings from  these assessments could require that the change proponent reconvene the Safety Risk  Management (SRM) panel attendees and update the SRM document as needed.  

Audit and assessment programs evaluate:  

   The effectiveness of each Service Unit’s performance and operations;     The effectiveness of Air Traffic Control (ATC) facilities’ and Technical Operations (AJW)  Districts’ internal Quality Control efforts (e.g., operational skills assessments, system  service reviews, certification, periodic maintenance, data integrity, modification, and  availability);     The effectiveness of Quality Control mitigation efforts in response to identified trends  and risks;     Trends identified from safety data analysis;     The effectiveness of safety-related policies and procedures; and     Compliance with and maturity of the ATO’s SMS.  

# 6.1.1  ATO Compliance Verification Evaluation Program  

FAA Order JO 7210.633,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Assurance (QA) , and  FAA  Order JO 7210.634,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Control , describe the current ATC  facility evaluation and assessment programs that involve assessments and audits focusing on  compliance and safety.  Air Traffic Service Area Directors, Air Traffic Managers (ATMs), and  AJW Districts are responsible for conducting internal evaluations of their respective facilities.   The Quality Assurance Group, AJI-12, retains oversight of the ATC evaluation process and  performs program assessments.  

# 6.1.2  Difference between ATC Facility Audits and Assessments  

The ATM conducts internal compliance verifications of their facility in accordance with  FAA  Order JO 7210.634 .  AJI conducts audits based on identified or suspected safety issues and  noncompliance in accordance with  FAA Order JO 1000.37,  Air Traffic Organization Safety  Management System .  The office determines priorities by soliciting input from the Service Areas  and other FAA Lines of Business (LOBs) and by analyzing objective criteria from sources such  as occurrence reports and risk analysis results.  In addition, AJI conducts no-notice spot  inspections of ATC facilities and AJW activities, including the Aviation System Standards group.  

# 6.1.3  National Airspace System Technical Evaluation Program  

FAA Order 6000.15,  General Maintenance Handbook for National Airspace System (NAS)  Facilities ;  FAA Order JO 6040.6,  National Airspace System Technical Evaluation Program ;   and  FAA Order 8200.1,  United States Standard Flight Inspection Manual , describe the equipment  evaluation and auditing programs that are part of the National Airspace System (NAS) Technical  Evaluation Program.  

The NAS Technical Evaluation Program provides AJI with asset management and safety  decision-making information based on an independent review of:  

   How well facilities and services meet their intended objectives:  o  Evaluators check key performance parameters and certification parameters at  selected facilities.  o  Evaluators review NAS Performance Analysis and NAS Performance Index data.     How well the maintenance program is executed:  o  Evaluators review facility logs to verify certification, periodic maintenance  accomplishments, and documentation of corrective and scheduled maintenance  activities.  o  Evaluators review the completion of required modifications.  o  Evaluators review facility documentation, such as Technical Performance Records,  and required reference data.     How well customer needs are being met:  o  Evaluators solicit customer feedback through interviews and surveys.  o  Evaluators review the outage coordination process.  

Evaluators may also review specialist certification records and credentials.  These reviews are  either part of a special inspection or are random spot checks of documentation in a location that  is geographically convenient to the routine evaluation.  

# 6.1.4  Independent Operational Assessments  

AJI supports the agency’s commitment to field-safe and operationally ready solutions by  conducting Independent Operational Assessments (IOAs) on designated new or modified  systems or capabilities before the In-Service Management phase.  An IOA is a full system- or  capability-level evaluation conducted in an operational environment.  An IOA’s purpose is to  confirm the readiness of a system from an operational and safety perspective.  IOAs are  independent of the Program Management Organization (AJM) implementing the solution.  IOAs  evaluate systems against pre-determined critical operational issues.  Hazards identified by an  IOA must still undergo all necessary phases of the SRM process by the change proponent.  

The Vice President of AJI directs the commencement of an IOA after the acceptance of an IOA  Readiness Declaration from the Vice President of AJM.  To assess the system/capability, AJI  collaborates with the organizations that will operate, maintain, or otherwise be operationally  affected by the solution.  AJI reports any new or previously identified hazards, as well as  operational concerns, based on data observed and collected during the IOA.  

At the conclusion of an IOA, the team assesses the solution’s operational readiness based on  the identified hazards and any observed operational concerns.  The team reports and briefs the  results of the IOA to affected stakeholders, including the Vice President of AJI, AJM, the  affected operating service(s), and any other affected organizations.  The results are also  provided to the In-Service Decision authority.  The change proponent is responsible for the  treatment and monitoring phases of SRM for the hazards identified during the IOA.  

# 6.1.5  Independent Assessments  

AJI performs independent assessments to evaluate operational procedures, order compliance,  fielded systems, and safety benefits.  An AJI independent assessment is independent of the  Program Office or operating service responsible for the program or operation.  They are  post-implementation evaluations of NAS changes that assess actual performance.  

During independent assessments, the teams verify that any previously documented hazards  were rated accurately (based on observed data) and that no unacceptable safety risks exist.  In  addition, teams may identify operational issues and other findings.  

Independent assessments may involve several facility or program assessments over a long  period of time, one assessment that lasts for an extended period of time, or multiple brief  assessments.  The processes and procedures are tailored according to the duration of the  assessment and the complexity of the operation or program being assessed.  The assessment  may be conducted at one or multiple sites, and data may be collected on site or remotely.   Results and/or recommendations are based on the assessment team’s analysis of data  collected during and, if applicable, before the assessment.  The conclusions and  recommendations are independent from external sources.  

# 6.2 Safety Data Reporting, Tracking, and Analysis  

SMSs require the collection and analysis of data from different sources and various vantage  points to determine if hazards exist.  An important aspect of safety data analysis is developing  the capability to sort and analyze a vast array of data and transforming that data into information  that permits the identification and mitigation of hazards, thus preventing future incidents and  accidents.  

# 6.2.1  Purpose of Safety Data Collection and Evaluation  

The tracking and analyzing of safety data to enhance the ATO’s awareness of potentially  hazardous situations is a critical aspect of the SMS.  AJI assists with the collection and analysis  of agency-wide safety data and supports sharing the data to continually improve the safety of  the NAS.  

Safety data are used to:  

   Identify risks, systemic trends, and vulnerabilities in the system;     Determine the effects of a NAS change on the operation as a whole;     Assess the performance of safety requirements in managing risk;     Identify areas where safety could be improved;     Contribute to accident and incident prevention; and     Assess the effectiveness of training.  

In most cases, if the analysis of safety data leads to the identification of issues or hazards, the  resolution or corrective action constitutes a NAS change, which requires SRM.  This is an  example of the continuous, closed-loop process for managing safety risk.  

Safety Assurance  

![](images/47a4c0a376ec56f7e05a90de61ce362c13f1389ee319862ec15b53236d525ff2.jpg)  

# 6.2.2  AJI’s Role in Safety Data Collection and Evaluation  

AJI obtains safety data through various sources within and outside the FAA.  AJI measures  safety by tracking safety metrics to produce reports on NAS safety, which are shared with  appropriate LOBs and/or external stakeholders.  

# 6.2.3  Safety Data Collection and Reporting Processes  

The FAA collects and reports on safety data from various sources in the NAS.    Section 7   lists  many of the existing FAA and ATO orders, processes, and databases related to safety data  collection and reporting.  

   FAA Order JO 7210.632,  Air Traffic Organization Occurrence Reporting , provides  specific direction regarding the recording, reporting, and investigation of air traffic  incidents.     FAA Order JO 6040.15,  National Airspace Performance Reporting System , and  FAA  Order 6000.30,  National Airspace System Maintenance Policy ,   cover reporting on the  serviceability of ATO facilities and systems, such as failures and degradations of  communications, surveillance, and other systems and equipment that affect safety.   Maintenance guidelines, directives, checklists, configuration management, and the NAS  Technical Evaluation Program all contribute to the periodic review and maintenance of  equipment and procedures.     The Safety Recommendation Reporting System provides FAA aviation safety inspectors  with a method to develop and submit safety recommendations directly to the Office of  Accident Investigation and Prevention.  (See  FAA Order 8020.16,  Air Traffic  Organization Aircraft Accident and Aircraft Incident Notification, Investigation, and  Reporting .)     The Risk Analysis Process 1  quantifies the level of risk present in any air traffic incident.   It provides a method for consistent and coherent identification of risk elements and  

allows users to prioritize actions designed to reduce the effect of those elements.  The  process uses the Risk Analysis Tool developed by EUROCONTROL to analyze each  RAE.  RAEs are assessed by a panel of air traffic and flight operations personnel  (e.g., controllers and air-transport rated pilots).  This panel is responsible for conducting  the analysis of RAEs and coordinating the post-assessment reporting, mitigating, and  tracking.  The Risk Analysis Tool produces a numerical value of severity and  repeatability on a risk matrix.  The Risk Analysis Tool also captures any associated  causal, systemic, and contributing factors.  

   Aviation Risk Identification and Assessment (ARIA) identifies and assesses latent risk in  the NAS and helps prioritize event analysis.  Barrier Analysis Review (BAR) is the  assessment of safety data to determine systemic risk and includes an evaluation of  safety barrier resiliency.  The aggregate data produced by this process assists in the  identification of systemic trends and potential risk in the NAS.  Referred ARIA Reports,  potential operational risk identified during the Quality Assurance (QA) validation process,  service area QA manager referral, National Air Traffic Controllers Association service  area or national safety representative referral, AJI Headquarters manager referral, and  random QA selections are all means by which safety data may be referred for BAR.  

Several non-punitive, voluntary reporting programs allow pilots and ATO personnel to report an  incident or event without reprisal.  These programs include the Aviation Safety Action  Program (refer to the  Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service Safety Oversight Circular 07-04,  Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) for Credentialed ATO Personnel ), the Aviation Safety  Reporting Program, the Technical Operations Safety Action Program, and the Air Traffic Safety  Action Program.  They are designed to foster consistent reporting and higher quality data.  

Other mechanisms employed by the FAA for employees to report issues include the  Unsatisfactory Condition Report program, the Aviation Safety Hotline, and the Administrator’s  Hotline.  Both hotlines can be reached by calling 1-800-255-1111.  

# 7.1 Safety Data and Information Repositories  

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees populate several aviation safety databases  with information regarding National Airspace System (NAS) safety events and serviceability.   Many professionals use aviation safety data and information as input for the development of  NAS safety enhancements.  For assistance in collecting safety data, contact the Safety and  Technical Training (AJI) Safety Analysis Group, AJI-32.  Sources for gathering safety data and  information include:  

   National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations;     FAA recommendations;     Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service compliance issues;     Requirements for new communication, navigation, surveillance, and automation services  to enhance or expand airspace management;   Unsatisfactory Condition Reports;    Employee suggestions;     Applications for procedural changes;     Research and development;     Acquisition of new systems and equipment;     Industry advocacy;     Participation in international forums;  

Table 7.1  provides an overview of various safety databases and recording systems used by the  FAA, and  Table 7.2  outlines data types and applicable reporting requirements.

# 8.1 Definitions  

Acceptable Level of Safety Risk.   Medium or low safety risk.  

Accident.   An unplanned event or series of events that results in death; injury; or damage to, or  loss of, equipment or property.  

Active Failure.   An error of omission or commission that is made in the course of a particular  operation.  An active failure can also be a known problem or a known mechanical deficiency or  fault.  

Acquisition Management System (AMS).   A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policy  dealing with any aspect of lifecycle acquisition management and related disciplines.  The AMS  also serves as the FAA’s Capital Planning and Investment Control process.  

Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service (AOV) Acceptance.   The process whereby the regulating  organization has delegated the authority to the service provider to make changes within the  confines of approved standards and only requires the service provider to notify the regulator of  those changes within 30 days.  Changes made by the service provider in accordance with their  delegated authority can be made without prior approval by the regulator.  

Analysis.   The process of identifying a question or issue to be addressed, examining the issue,  investigating then interpreting the results, and possibly making a recommendation.  Analysis  typically involves using scientific or mathematical methods for evaluation.  

AOV Approval.   The formal act of approving a National Airspace System (NAS) change  submitted by a requesting organization.  This action is required prior to the proposed NAS  change being implemented.  

Assessment.   A process of measuring or judging the value or level of something.  

Assumptions.   Conclusions based on the presumed condition of a system or system state—not  documented facts, desired outcomes, or mitigations.  

Audit.   A review of an organization’s safety programs or initiatives to verify completion of tasks  and to determine the organization’s compliance with FAA directives and procedures.  

Aviation Risk Identification and Assessment (ARIA).   An automated system that helps  employ risk-based, data-driven decision-making, which facilitates better insight into potential risk  in the NAS.  

Barrier Analysis Review (BAR).   The process used to assess severity, likelihood, and barrier  effectiveness in Referred ARIA Reports.  Barrier analysis is also used to identify and assess  factors (mitigating, aggravating, or observed) for air traffic operations where at least one aircraft  is receiving Air Traffic Control (ATC) services.  

Baseline.   The written processes, procedures, specifications, and other conditions of the  system that were accepted as the starting point for oversight of safety in the NAS on March 14,  2005.  The Air Traffic Organization (ATO) must maintain the NAS at a safety level that is at least  equal to that state, in compliance with current policies, processes, and procedures that are  documented in its orders, handbooks, and manuals.  (Note:   “Acceptance of the baseline did not  imply or state that the NAS was or was not inherently safe as configured on that date, nor did it  imply that the NAS had no existing high risks,”  AOV Safety Oversight Circular 07-01,  Acceptance of the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Baseline .)  

Bounding.   A process of limiting the analysis and assessment of a change or system to only  the elements that affect or interact with each other to accomplish the central function of that  change or system.  

Cause.   The origin of a hazard.  

Change Proponent.   An individual, Program Office, facility, or organization within the FAA that  has identified the need for Safety Risk Management (SRM) or has proposed or is sponsoring a  NAS change or means to address an identified existing safety issue.  The SRM panel members  are selected at the discretion of the change proponent and/or SRM panel facilitator.  

Common Cause Failure.   A failure that occurs when a single fault results in the corresponding  failure of multiple system components or functions.  

Compliance Audit.   An audit that evaluates conformance to established criteria, processes,  and work practices.  The objective of a compliance audit is to determine whether employees  and processes have followed established policies and procedures.  

Continuous Loop.   SRM processes are repeated until the safety risk associated with each  hazard is acceptable and has met its predicted residual risk.  

Concurrence.   The concurrence signature is used to represent a technical review of the SRM  document and to confirm the rationale used throughout is consistent with the SRM process.   The concurrence signature comes from an SRM expert who is well versed in this Safety  Management System (SMS) Manual and familiar with the terminology and processes therein.  

Configuration Management.   A process for establishing and maintaining the consistency of a  product’s performance, function, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and  operational information throughout its life.  

Confirmation.   The act of using a written response from a non–SRM panel attendee to confirm  the integrity of a specific item or assertion.  

Consensus.   The judgement arrived at by a majority of panel members.  

Control.   Any means currently reducing a hazard’s causes or effects.  (See “Mitigation.”)  

Credible.   It is reasonable to expect that the assumed combination of conditions that define the  system state will occur within the operational lifetime of a typical ATC system (i.e., 30 years).  

Critical NAS System.   A system that provides functions or services that, if lost, would prevent  users of the NAS from exercising safe separation and control over aircraft.  

Current Risk.   The composite of severity and frequency of a hazard’s effects in the present  state.  

Development Assurance.   All the planned and systematic actions used to substantiate, at an  adequate level of confidence, that errors in requirements, design, and implementation have  been identified and corrected such that the system satisfies the applicable approval or  certification basis.  

Dissention.   If any SRM panel member disagrees with the SRM panel’s official findings  (i.e., group consensus cannot be reached), that panel member should provide the nature and  summary of the disagreement for inclusion in this part of the SRM document.  

Effect.   The real or credible harmful outcome that has occurred or can be expected to occur if  the hazard occurs in the defined system state.  

Equipment.   A complete assembly—operating either independently or within a  system/sub-system—that performs a specific function.  

Error-Tolerant System.   A system that is designed and implemented in such a way that, to the  maximum extent possible, errors and equipment failures do not result in an incident or accident.   An error-tolerant design is the human equivalent of a fault-tolerant design.  

Existing Safety Issue.   Existing contributing factors or findings that led to, or could lead to, an  unsafe outcome.  

Facility.   Generally, any installation of equipment designated to aid in the navigation,  communication, or control of air traffic.  Specifically, the term denotes the total electronic  equipment, power generation, or distribution systems and any structure used to house, support,  and/or protect these equipment and systems.  A facility may include a number of systems,  sub-systems, and equipment.  

Fail Operational.   A system designed such that if it sustains a fault, it still provides a subset of  its specified behavior.  

Fail Safe.   A system designed such that if it fails, it fails in a way that will cause no harm to  other devices or will not present a danger to personnel.  

Fault Tolerance.   The ability of a system to respond without interruption or loss of capabilities in  the event of an unexpected hardware or software failure.  

Frequency.   An expression of how often a given effect occurs.  

Hazard.   Any real or potential condition that can cause injury, illness, or death to people;  damage to or loss of a system, equipment, or property; or damage to the environment.  A  hazard is a prerequisite to an accident or incident.  

Hazard Analysis Worksheet (HAW).   A tool used to provide an initial overview of the hazard’s  presence in the overall flow of the operation.  

Hazard Identification.   The determination of the hazard scenarios and associated  consequences (undesired events) as a result of introducing a new system into the NAS.  This  provides an intermediate product that expresses the hazards that will be used during risk  analysis and assessment.  

High-Risk Hazard.   A hazard with an unacceptable level of safety risk; the NAS change cannot  be implemented unless the hazard’s associated risk is mitigated and reduced to medium or low.  

Hull Loss.   An   aircraft that is destroyed / substantially damaged beyond economic repair,  missing, or completely inaccessible.  

Human-Centered.   The structured process during concept and requirement definition, design,  development, and implementation that identifies the user as the focal point of the effort for which  procedures, equipment, facilities, and other components serve to support human capabilities  and compensate for human limitations; also called “user-centered.”  

Human Factors.   A multidisciplinary effort to generate and compile information about human  capabilities and limitations and apply that information to equipment, systems, facilities,  procedures, jobs, environments, training, staffing, and personnel management for safe,  comfortable, and effective human performance.  (See  FAA Order 9550.8,  Human Factors  Policy .)  

Incident.   An occurrence other than an accident that affects or could affect the safety of  operations.  

Initial Risk.   The composite of the severity and likelihood of a hazard’s effect, considering only  controls and documented assumptions for a given system state.  It describes the risk before any  of the proposed mitigations are implemented.

Mitigation.   Any means to reduce the risk of a hazard.  

National Airspace System (NAS).   A complex system that is composed of airspace, airports,  aircraft, pilots, air navigation facilities, and ATC facilities; communication, navigation, and  surveillance services and supporting technologies and systems; operating rules, regulations,  policies, and procedures; and people who implement, sustain, or operate the system  components.  

NAS Change.   A modification to any element of the NAS that pertains to, or could affect, the  provision of air traffic management and/or communication, navigation, and surveillance  services.  

Near Mid-Air Collision Categories.   FAA Order 8900.1,  Flight Standards Information  Management System , Volume 7, Chapter 4, identifies the following definitions of Critical,  Potential, and Low categories:  

1)  “A” – Critical.   A situation in which collision avoidance was due to chance, rather than a  pilot’s evasive act or action.  Situations where large evasive maneuvers are necessary to  avoid collision and/or situations where little or no time is available to recognize the threat  and react appropriately.  Encounters of less than 100 feet separation are considered to  be critical risk.  

2)  “B” – Potential.   A situation which would probably have resulted in a collision if no  action had been taken by the pilot; a situation in which a Traffic Alert and Collision  Avoidance System (TCAS) Resolution Advisory was received and followed; or where a  Traffic Information Services (TIS) alert or the pilot sighting the traffic without electronic  aid caused pilot evasive action.  A “potential” risk is a situation in which a collision would  probably occur eventually if no action is taken by either pilot.  Situations of encounters of  less than 500 feet separation may be considered potential risk.  

3)  “C” – Low Potential.   A situation in which a collision is unlikely, however, one or both  pilots was surprised by the proximity of the other; one in which the course of the aircraft  bring them closer than required approved separation; a situation where whether or not  the pilot took evasive action a collision probably would not occur; or a situation in which  there is ample time to take action to avoid a collision.  A TIS alert or TCAS traffic  advisory may cause the pilot to take action after sighting the traffic either with or without  the aid of an electronic alert system; situations of encounters of 500 feet or greater;  slowly converging flightpaths may be considered low potential collision risks.  

Objective Evidence.   Documented proof; the evidence must not be circumstantial and must be  obtained through observation, measurement, testing, or other means.  

Observation.   The process of witnessing an organization’s process.  It differs from a physical  examination in that the auditor only observes the process; no physical evidence is obtained.  

Operational Assessments.   An assessment to address the effectiveness and efficiency of an  organization.  The objective of an operational assessment is to determine the organization’s  ability to achieve its goals and accomplish its mission.  

Opposing Opinion.   An opinion submitted in writing if a Subject Matter Expert (SME)  participating in an SRM panel disagrees with that SRM panel’s official findings; opposing  opinions are attached to the SRM document as part of the distribution.  

Oversight.   Regulatory supervision to validate the development of a defined system and verify  compliance to a pre-defined set of standards.  

Physical Examination.   The act of gathering physical evidence.  It is a substantive test  involving the counting, inspecting, gathering, and inventorying of physical and tangible assets,  such as cash, plants, and equipment.  

Preconditions.   The system states or variables that must exist for a hazard or an accident to  occur in an error-tolerant system.  

Predicted Residual Risk.   The risk that is estimated to exist after the safety requirements are  implemented or after all avenues of risk mitigation have been explored.

Process.   A set of interrelated or interacting activities that transform inputs into outputs.  

Program Assessment.   A Safety Assessment’s review of an organization’s safety programs or  initiatives.  Programs and initiatives include, but are not limited to, Service Area Quality  Assurance (QA), Air Traffic Facility Quality Control, Runway Incursion Prevention Plans,  Equipment Availability Programs, and Contractor QA programs for Federal Contract  Towers (FCT).  

Qualitative Data.   Subjective data expressed as a measure of quality; nominal data.  

Quality Assurance (QA).   A program for the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the  various aspects of a project, service, or facility to ensure that standards of quality are being met.   It is a process to assess and review the processes and systems that are used to provide outputs  (whether services or products) and to identify risks and trends that can be used to improve  these systems and processes.  

Quality Control.   A process that assesses the output (whether a product or service) of a  particular process or function and identifies any deficiencies or problems that need to be  addressed.  

Quantitative Data.   Objective data expressed as a quantity, number, or amount, allowing for a  more rational analysis and substantiation of findings.  

Recording.   The process of documenting the identified hazards and the associated safety  information.  

Redundancy.   A design attribute in a system that ensures duplication or repetition of elements  to provide alternative functional channels in case of failure.  Redundancy allows the service to  be provided by more than one path to maximize the availability of the service.  

Requirement.   An essential attribute or characteristic of a system.  A requirement is a condition  or capability that must be met or passed by a system to satisfy a contract, standard,  specification, or other formally imposed document or need.  

Residual Risk.   The level of risk that has been verified by completing a thorough monitoring  plan with an achieved measurable safety performance target(s).  Residual risk is the composite  of the severity of a hazard’s effect and the frequency of the effect’s occurrence.  

Risk.   The composite of predicted severity and likelihood of the potential effect of a hazard.  

Risk Acceptance.   The confirmation by the appropriate management official that they  understand the safety risk associated with the NAS change or existing safety issue and that  they accept that safety risk into the NAS.  Risk acceptance requires that signatures have been  obtained for the safety requirements identified in the SRM document and that a comprehensive  monitoring plan has been developed and will be followed to verify the predicted residual risk.  

Risk Analysis Event (RAE).   A loss of approved separation between two aircraft in a radar  environment that results in less than 66 percent of the applicable separation minima maintained.   FAA Order JO 7210.633,  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Quality Assurance (QA) , removed  RAEs and the process for notification and interviews associated with RAEs.  Any reference to  RAEs in this SMS Manual are for research and historical purposes only.

Safety Performance Monitoring.   The act of observing the safety performance of the NAS to  ensure an acceptable level of safety risk.  

Safety Performance Targets.   Measurable goals used to verify the predicted residual risk of a  hazard.  They should quantifiably define the predicted residual risk.  

Safety Policy.   The documented organizational policy that defines management’s commitment,  responsibility, and accountability for safety.  One of the four components of the SMS, Safety  Policy identifies and assigns responsibilities to key safety personnel.  

Safety Promotion.   The communication and distribution of information to improve the safety  culture and the development and implementation of programs and/or processes that support the  integration and continuous improvement of the SMS within the ATO.  One of the four  components of the SMS, Safety Promotion allows the ATO to share and provide evidence of  successes and lessons learned.  

Safety Requirement.   A planned or proposed means to reduce a hazard’s causes or effects.  

Safety Requirement Approval.   Certification that the safety requirements can and will be  implemented.  

Safety Risk Management (SRM).   A process within the SMS composed of describing the  system; identifying the hazards; and analyzing, assessing, and treating risk.  One of the four  components of the SMS, SRM includes processes to define strategies for monitoring the safety  risk of the NAS.  SRM complements Safety Assurance.  

SRM Document.   A document that records the SRM panel attendees’ determinations for NAS  changes and existing safety issues.  It presents evidence supporting whether the NAS change  and/or risk management strategies should be accepted by ATO or FAA management officials  from a safety risk perspective.  

SRM Document Approval (for SRM Documents With Hazards).   Indication that the SRM  document was developed in accordance with policy and guidance; hazards were systematically  identified using a structured approach; risk was appropriately analyzed and assessed; if  identified, safety requirements were deemed valid; safety performance targets or other methods  to verify predicted residual risk were approved by the responsible Service Unit; and a monitoring  plan was prepared.  SRM document approval does not constitute acceptance of the risk  associated with the NAS change or existing safety issue or approval to implement the NAS  change.  

SRM Document Approval (for SRM Documents Without Hazards).   Indication that the SRM  document was developed in accordance with policy and guidance, the NAS change did not  introduce new hazards or increase safety risk, and the SRM document includes a detailed  rationale to support the finding of no hazards.  

SRM Panel.   A meeting of a diverse group of SRM panel members, SMEs, observers, and  facilitators from the various organizations affected by the NAS change or existing safety issue.   They objectively identify potential hazards and effects associated with the NAS change or  existing safety issue and provide findings and recommendations to decision-makers, which are  captured in an SRM document.  

SRM Panel Co-Facilitator.   A person who shares responsibilities with the SRM panel facilitator  in supporting the SRM panel.  

SRM Panel Facilitator.   A trained expert on the SRM process who moderates the deliberations  of the SRM panel attendees from a neutral position.  They invoke participation, mediate  discussion, ensure any dissenting opinions are documented, keep the meeting organized and  on topic, remain neutral throughout the process without advocating for a specific outcome, and  may support the development of the SRM document.  

SRM Panel Member.   An SRM panel member is an FAA employee 1  or other representative (as  specified in an FAA Memorandum of Agreement) 2  who objectively performs the SRM process.   The SRM panel members are selected at the discretion of the change proponent and/or SRM  panel facilitator.  

SRM Panel Observer.   An individual who is not part of the SRM panel meeting and does not  participate in the deliberation process (only observes the proceedings).  They have an objective  to obtain a better understanding of the SRM process—not the NAS change or existing safety  issue being addressed.  SRM panel observers are permitted at the discretion of the change  proponent.  

Safety Risk Tracking.   A closed-loop means of ensuring that the requirements and mitigations  associated with each hazard that has associated medium or high risk are implemented.  Safety  risk tracking is the process of defining safety requirements, verifying implementation, and  readdressing the risk to make sure the hazard meets its risk level requirement before being  accepted.  

Severity.   The consequence or impact of a hazard’s effect or outcome in terms of degree of  loss or harm.

Figure A.1: Overview of the Safety Risk Management Process  

# 1. Guidance for Preparing for and Convening a Safety Risk Management Panel  

# 1.1 Overview  

This section provides practical guidance for applying the Safety Risk Management (SRM)  process, which is depicted in  Figure A.1 .  This section outlines information regarding how to:  

   Determine whether an SRM panel is required,     Prepare for and convene an SRM panel, and     Produce the resulting SRM documentation.  

# 1.2 SRM Planning and Initial Decision-Making  

The scope of an SRM effort is based on the type, complexity, and effect of the National  Airspace System (NAS) change or existing safety issue.  The following steps are essential to  performing any initial decision-making as well as planning and preparing for SRM of all NAS  changes and existing safety issues:  

   Define the NAS change or existing safety issue and the scope of the operational system  and/or environment affected.     Determine the need for an SRM panel.     Identify an SRM panel facilitator and appropriate SRM panel attendees.  

To support these activities, each of which are detailed below, the change proponent for the  SRM effort should consult their Service Center Quality Control Group; the Safety and Technical  Training (AJI) Safety Engineering Team, AJI-314, Manager (who can be contacted through the  Air Traffic Organization (ATO) Safety Management System (SMS) mailbox ); or a local safety  Point of Contact (POC) when initiating the process.  

# 1.2.1 Define the NAS Change / Existing Safety Issue  

The change proponent must properly define the purpose and scope of the NAS change or  existing safety issue using input from technical experts.  The change proponent should consider  the impact of the NAS change on relevant NAS equipment, operations, and procedures.  This  includes:  

   The NAS change or existing safety issue,     The system state(s) in which the change will be operational / in which the existing safety  issue exists,     Assumptions (not controls), and     The components of the 5M Model.  

# 1.2.2 Determine the Need for an SRM Panel  

After defining the scope of the NAS change, the change proponent should determine if the NAS  change pertains to or has the potential to affect safe provision of air traffic management or  communication, navigation, and surveillance services using input from the technical experts.  If  it does not, then no further analysis is required (i.e., an SRM panel, SRM document, and Safety  Management Tracking System (SMTS) entry are not required).  Conversely, if there is potential  for the NAS change to affect the safety of the NAS, then an SRM panel and SMTS entry are  required.  The SRM panel only determines the safety of the NAS change—not its suitability,  validity, or necessity.  Panel deliberations must not be used to define what the NAS change  

should be or to change the purpose or intent of the NAS change defined by the organization(s)  sponsoring the NAS change.  

Likewise, when using SRM to address an existing safety issue, convening an SRM panel is  warranted.  When addressing existing safety issues, it is still necessary to identify hazards and  causes associated with the issue, but it is not necessary to assess the validity or current risk  level if it has already been identified and confirmed by a safety audit or post-event safety risk  analysis.  

# 1.2.3 Identify SRM Panel Attendees  

The change proponent works closely with the SRM panel facilitator/co-facilitator to identify the  SRM panel attendees necessary to perform SRM.  The size and composition of the SRM panel  will vary based on the type and complexity of the proposed NAS change or existing safety issue,  and it should be limited to an appropriately sized yet diverse team of stakeholders and Subject  Matter Experts (SMEs).  A stakeholder is considered to be an entity that could be affected by  the proposed NAS change or existing safety issue from a safety risk perspective (i.e., an entity  responsible for any of the following tasks: implementing the NAS change when approved,  accepting the residual risk, implementing safety requirements, or affirming controls).  

The change proponent, with the SRM panel facilitator, should obtain information on the  knowledge, experiences, and positions of each attendee.  The following list, though not  all-inclusive, provides types of experts to consider for participation on an SRM panel:  

   Employees directly responsible for developing the NAS change or managing the existing  safety issue,     Employees with current knowledge of and experience with the system or NAS change,     Hardware/Software engineering and/or automation experts (to provide knowledge on  equipment performance),     Human factors specialists,   Systems specialists,  System operators,    Employees skilled in collecting and analyzing hazard and error data and using  specialized tools and techniques (e.g., operations research, data, and human factors),     Quality Control / Quality Assurance employees (to help ensure that the safety  performance target is measurable and auditable or to help develop an alternate means  to verify predicted residual risk),     Air traffic procedures specialists,     Information and cyber-security specialists,     Third-party stakeholders (e.g., pilots, pilot organizations, and industry representatives),   Air traffic controllers,    Maintenance technicians,     Traffic management specialists, and     Bargaining unit representatives.  

Although not required, the 5M Model is useful for identifying potential SRM panel members and  SMEs.  Note that it may be necessary to elevate a request for participation to an appropriate  management level to ensure participation by all affected stakeholders.  

Any SRM panel meeting attendee should fulfill one of the roles specified in the following  subsections.  

# 1.2.3.1 Change Proponent  

A  change proponent  is an individual, Program Office, facility, or organization within the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) that has identified the need for SRM or has proposed or is  sponsoring a NAS change or means to address an existing safety issue.  

Among other responsibilities, the change proponent works with the SRM panel facilitator to  define the purpose and scope of the NAS change or existing safety issue, capture the safety  findings from the SRM panel meeting in an SRM document, and ensure that the SRM document  is recorded in SMTS.  The change proponent may record the information directly, designate a  responsible individual, or work with the SRM panel facilitator or organization responsible for  accepting safety risk to enter the SRM document into SMTS.  

Unless circumstances warrant doing so, the change proponent should not function as an SRM  panel member at their SRM panel.  

# 1.2.3.2 SRM Panel Facilitator  

An  SRM panel facilitator  is a trained expert on the SRM process who moderates the  deliberations of the SRM panel attendees from a neutral position.  

The change proponent selects or requests an SRM panel facilitator.  After, the change  proponent and the facilitator (and co-facilitator if one is identified) will have an initial meeting to  prepare for the SRM panel.  During this time, the facilitator will provide a briefing to the change  proponent on the SRM process and work with the change proponent to develop the scope of the  SRM panel.  The SRM panel facilitator should also become well-versed in the subject matter  (e.g., by requesting briefings and collecting all available and relevant safety information), as  necessary, before the SRM panel convenes.  

This coordination and preparation between the change proponent and facilitator/co-facilitator  results in the development of a briefing package to provide to SRM panel attendees before the  panel meeting.  The briefing package should include all relevant information about the NAS  change or existing safety issue, the SRM panel meeting invitation, an agenda, briefing  materials, and directions to the meeting venue.  

An effective SRM panel facilitator ensures the SRM process is followed in an unbiased manner  and works to achieve consensus, a judgement by a majority of panel members.  They invoke  participation, mediate discussion, ensure differences of opinions are documented, keep the  meeting organized and on topic, and remain neutral throughout the process without advocating  for a specific outcome.  The facilitator (or their designee) may assist the change proponent in  writing the SRM document, which describes the safety findings of the SRM panel meeting.   Facilitator duties and responsibilities must be discussed with the change proponent and  communicated to the SRM panel attendees.  

# 1.2.3.2.1 SRM Panel Co-Facilitator  

An  SRM panel co-facilitator  is a person who shares responsibilities with the SRM panel  facilitator in supporting the SRM panel.  

An SRM panel co-facilitator, if one is assigned, assists the facilitator.  A co-facilitator is  especially helpful when the panel size exceeds 12 attendees and/or the subject matter is  complex.  Like the facilitator, the co-facilitator (or their designee) may assist the change  proponent in writing the SRM document describing the safety findings of the SRM panel  meeting.  Co-facilitator duties and responsibilities must be discussed with the change proponent  and communicated to the SRM panel attendees.  

# 1.2.3.2.2 Facilitation by AJI Safety Case Leads  

An AJI  Safety Case Lead (SCL)  is an expert in SMS policy and guidance that pertain to the  ATO.  They may facilitate SRM efforts for existing safety issues and NAS changes that meet  any of the following criteria:  

   It has a high (potentially political, economic, or financial) impact on the FAA, the NAS, or  the flying public.     It is the result of financial or operational decisions made by FAA executive management,  cabinet-level executives, or Congress.     The NAS change is a proposed means of addressing any safety issues identified as part  of the Top 5 Program.     The NAS change modifies safety policy that must be incorporated in a directive.     It can or does present operational or technical conflicts to multiple affected Service Units  or FAA Lines of Business (LOBs).  

# 1.2.3.3 SRM Panel Member  

An  SRM panel member  is an FAA employee 1  or other representative (as specified in an FAA  Memorandum of Agreement) 2  who objectively performs the SRM process.  

An SRM panel member represents the program, facility, organization, or constituency potentially  affected by the safety risk, the safety requirements associated with the proposed NAS change  and/or the existing safety issue.  Among other responsibilities, SRM panel members evaluate  safety risk associated with the NAS change or existing safety issue objectively, thoroughly, and  fairly; do not debate the validity of the NAS change; and review and comment on SRM  documents.  

# 1.2.3.4 SME  

An  SME  is an FAA employee or third-party stakeholder who serves as a technical expert on the  NAS change, procedure, hardware/software, or proposed solution undergoing SRM.  

SMEs share data, detailed information, and experience about the subject being discussed  during the SRM panel meeting; partake in technical dialogue with SRM panel members; and  review and comment on the aspects of SRM documents for which their expertise is applicable.  

They are not panel members and do not participate in the consensus-driven decisions regarding  initial / predicted residual risk levels while analyzing or assessing safety risks to the NAS.  

Note: In other areas of the ATO SMS Manual, the term “subject matter expert” is used  generically.  Each SRM panel attendee is expected to have technical knowledge in a subject  area that would suggest their participation in the panel meeting is appropriate.  

# 1.2.4 SRM Panel Observer  

An  SRM panel observer  is an individual who is not part of the SRM panel meeting and does  not participate in the deliberation process (only observes the proceedings).  

An observer has an objective to obtain a better understanding of the SRM process—not the  NAS change or existing safety issue being addressed.  They are not active members of the  SRM panel meeting; do not provide input during the deliberations; and, like all other attendees,  may not use electronic recording devices during the panel meeting.  The presence of panel  observers is permitted at the discretion of the change proponent.  

# 1.2.4.1 Air Traffic Safety Oversight Service Attendance  

The SRM panel facilitator or change proponent must evaluate the NAS change or existing  safety issue to determine whether it will require approval or acceptance from the Air Traffic  Safety Oversight Service (AOV) and consider their attendance at the SRM panel.  Contact the  Safety Management Group, AJI-31, Manager for guidance, if necessary.  If AOV approval or  acceptance is required, then the SRM panel facilitator or change proponent must coordinate  with AJI to ensure compliance with AOV requirements.  

# 1.2.4.2 Guidance for Bargaining Unit Participation  

When selecting SRM panel attendees, adhere to the  Collective Bargaining Agreement  between  the FAA and affected bargaining unit representatives.  When a NAS change or existing safety  issue crosses Service Area boundaries and LOBs, the change proponent will ensure the  Management Services (AJG) Technical Labor Group, AJG-L1, is notified.  

Ensure that all facilities, including their respective bargaining units, are given notification of the  upcoming SRM panel.  Labor organizations, such as the National Air Traffic Controllers  Association and Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, represent several different bargaining  units (engineers, controllers, attorneys, etc.).  In some cases, multiple bargaining units may  need to attend the panel to ensure that the appropriate expertise is available.  Multiple  bargaining unit members, when represented by the same labor union, may be SRM panel  members, but the labor organization representative will identify a lead representative that  speaks for the labor organization during the SRM panel.  

For assistance finding a labor union representative, contact AJG-L1 for more information.  

# 1.2.4.3 Participation on SRM Panels Outside of a Service Unit or the ATO  

ATO employees are often requested to participate as stakeholders or SMEs on SRM panels  sponsored by organizations outside of their Service Unit or the ATO.  It is important to support  these requests, whether they originate within or outside of the ATO.  Participation as an SME or  stakeholder does not necessarily mean that the organization represented by an SRM panel  member is responsible for developing or implementing safety requirements, accepting risk, or  approving the SRM document.  

When requesting the participation of an ATO Service Unit, the requestor should contact the  appropriate Program Office or Service Unit for coordination.  

# 1.3 Convening the SRM Panel  

Following the identification and invitation of SRM panel attendees, the SRM panel convenes.   On the first day of the SRM panel meeting, the SRM panel facilitator or a designee must present  an SRM panel orientation that includes:  

   The agenda for the meeting,     A summary of the goals and objectives for the SRM panel,     A brief review of the SRM process,     SRM panel ground rules,     The method(s) by which the SRM panel will identify hazards (if known), and     A draft or summary of the “Current System” and “Description of Change” sections of the  SRM document, if available, provided by the change proponent (see  Sections 1.4.1.3  and  1.4.1.4  of Annex A).  

# 1.3.1 SRM Panel Meeting Logistics  

The SRM panel facilitator may perform or delegate the function of time keeper in order to  manage start times and breaks.  The facilitator may also delegate the recording of meeting  notes, the writing of the SRM document, and the provision of audio/visual support.  

The SRM panel should be conducted using in-person meetings, if possible; however,  stakeholders can participate in SRM panel meetings via other methods, such as web meetings  or teleconferences.  In the event that the invited stakeholders cannot participate in an SRM  panel, consult with the change proponent and, if feasible, continue the SRM panel as  scheduled.  The findings should then be forwarded to the absent stakeholders to gather  additional input, comments, or concerns.  

# 1.3.2 SRM Panel Deliberations  

During the SRM panel, the SRM panel facilitator will lead attendees in objectively examining,  identifying, and mitigating potential safety hazards and effects associated with the NAS change  or existing safety issue.  If hazards are identified, the SRM panel facilitator will guide the  attendees through the five-step DIAAT process using the Hazard Analysis Worksheet (HAW)  and monitoring plan (see  Sections 1.3.2.1  and  1.3.2.2  of Annex A).  

SRM panel members should strive for unanimous agreement on risk determinations; however,  there may be instances in which not all SRM panel members agree with the panel’s consensus.   In those cases, record the difference of opinions from the SRM panel members in the SRM  document.  Dissenting SRM panel members should provide, in writing, their own rationale and  data for why their risk determination differs from that of the other SRM panel members.  The  written dissention must be included in the SRM document.  

The SRM panel facilitator must mediate and assist SRM panel members in working through  differences of opinion.  The facilitator should be able to recognize, acknowledge, and use  differences of opinion to help the SRM panel members consider different points of view.  

# 1.3.2.1 HAW  

Use the HAW to organize the SRM panel’s deliberations into 16 key categories.  It is at the  panel’s discretion to decide which items belong in the HAW.  It provides a snapshot of the SRM  panel conclusions and will be included in the SRM document for each hazard identified.  

# Table A.1: HAW

# 1.3.2.2 Monitoring Plan  

Use a monitoring plan table to organize the SRM panel’s plan for monitoring the safety  performance target and verifying the predicted residual risk for each hazard identified.   Information from the monitoring plan will be needed for the SRM document and entry into  SMTS.  

# Table A.2: Monitoring Plan  

![](images/3c44594655521fb2f891f46d1bad55742955a502c2e387195f72800fc3bcb75d.jpg)  

# 1.3.3 Factors that Jeopardize SRM Panel Results  

Failure to adequately describe the system and scope the NAS change or existing safety issue  can negatively affect the fidelity of the SRM process.  Change proponents, SRM panel  

facilitators, and SRM panel members should adhere to the following guidelines to help ensure  that SRM panel deliberations are relevant to the NAS change or existing safety issue:  

   Sufficiently define the scope.     Involve relevant stakeholders.     Identify drivers and constraints.     Define product boundaries and external interfaces.     Baseline the scope before writing requirements.  

# 1.4 Completing the SRM Documentation  

An  SRM document  records the SRM panel attendees’ determinations for NAS changes and  existing safety issues.  The SRM document presents evidence supporting whether the NAS  change and/or risk management strategies should be accepted by ATO or FAA management  officials from a safety risk perspective.  There are two types of SRM documents: safety findings  with hazards and safety findings without hazards.  

   Safety Finding With Hazards:  When an SRM panel determines that a NAS change or  existing safety issue could introduce hazards or increase safety risk, the panel must  complete each phase of the DIAAT process.  Typically, this results in new means to  reduce risk (i.e., safety requirements) being devised and proposed for implementation.   Safety risk and overall safety performance must be monitored after implementation of  the NAS change and/or safety requirements to address the identified hazards.  This  information should be contained in an SRM document with hazards.      Safety Finding Without Hazards:  When an SRM panel determines that no hazards will  

be introduced or that safety risk will not increase with the implementation of the NAS  change being assessed, an SRM document without hazards is used.  The SRM  document should include a description of the system and NAS change and a rationale  explaining why the change does not introduce hazards or increase safety risk.  

# 1.4.1 Writing the SRM Document 6  

The change proponent, the SRM panel facilitator, or a designated individual should begin  drafting the SRM document immediately after the SRM panel meeting.  The draft SRM  document should be presented to the SRM panel to verify that the SRM panel members’  discussions have been correctly recorded and consensus has been achieved.  In the event that  an SRM panel member does not concur with a determination made during the risk analysis or  risk assessment phases of the process, they are encouraged to submit a dissent in writing.   Such dissents are included in the SRM document for evaluation by the risk acceptance official.  

The change proponent, the SRM panel facilitator, a designated individual, or the organization  responsible for accepting safety risk must enter the SRM document into SMTS.  

The following list reflects the applicable sections and criteria for SRM documents:  

   Executive Summary   SRM Document Signatures  Current System     Description of Change / Existing Safety Issue     Rationale for a Safety Finding Without Hazards (if no hazards are identified)     Hazard Identification and Risk Determination (if hazards are identified)     Monitoring Plan (if hazards are identified)     Dissention (when applicable)     SRM Panel Attendees   Appendices  

For additional guidance about writing either type of document, consider using the SRM  document templates available in SMTS and on the  ATO SMS Toolbox .  

# 1.4.1.1 Executive Summary  

Use the Executive Summary to provide only the substantive information necessary for  decision-makers to understand the current system; NAS change / existing safety issue; and, if  applicable, the associated safety risk and proposed ways to address the hazards and safety  risk.  Provide detailed information and supporting narrative on these items in the body of the  SRM document.  

Include the following administrative information regarding the SRM document:  

   Title.   Include a clear, concise name of the document with which the document’s subject  can be easily understood.      Change Proponent Organization.   Provide the organization that is initiating the NAS  change or that has taken responsibility for addressing the existing safety issue.  Include  the organization’s name and FAA routing code.      Document Type.   Indicate the document type, such as Operations, Second-Level  Engineering, etc.  

For SRM documents with hazards, use the tables below to summarize the hazards identified  and proposed means of mitigation/monitoring:  

# Table A.3: Hazard Summary  

![](images/cfb0c5b95e503a3772d7766ce13156ba3097359e1bd64673b86b1f3ca88b3242.jpg)  

# Table A.4: Safety Requirements  

![](images/6ce1b668d621d0f489483ebb4194d96ac640d0c6c897fd043e73947a9e893c5e.jpg)  

# Table A.5: Monitoring Plan Summary  

![](images/a019da97476da49877c395c5d81a89d77c3d273200e615ba83d9ca9a547b3993.jpg)  

If no hazards are identified, do not include the above tables.  Instead, provide a brief rationale  for a safety finding without hazards.  

# 1.4.1.2 SRM Document Signatures  

Listed below are the signatures required on the SRM document signature page.  For each  signatory, include the printed name, signature (handwritten or electronic), organization, and  date.  Signatures should be obtained and must be listed in the following order:  concurrence (when appropriate); approver; risk acceptor; and the Director of Policy and  Performance, AJI-3, when necessary.  

1.  Concurrence.   Include a concurrence signature from an SRM expert who is well-versed  in this SMS Manual and familiar with the terminology and processes therein.  This  signature is used to represent a technical review of the SRM document and to confirm  the rationale used throughout is consistent with the SRM process.  

2.  Approval.   Include an approval signature from an official representing the organization  responsible for implementing the NAS change (and from the AJI-3 Director, if required).   An approver provides a technical and administrative quality control review of the SRM  document, its findings, and the identified results.  

Note: The official responsible for the approval signature cannot have been an SRM  panel member.  

3.  Risk Acceptance.   Include a risk acceptance signature from an appropriate official  representing the organization that will be using the safety-assessed NAS equipment,  policy, or procedure.  This signature indicates confirmation by the official that they  understand the safety risk associated with the NAS change or existing safety issue and  that they accept that safety risk into the NAS.  Risk acceptance requires that signatures  have been obtained for the safety requirements identified in the SRM document and that  a comprehensive monitoring plan has been developed and will be followed to verify the  predicted residual risk.  

The safety requirements signatures from the responsible organization(s) and associated POC(s)  are contained within the Executive Summary.  

# 1.4.1.3 Current System  

Provide a detailed description of the hardware/software system, operation, or procedure that  constitutes the NAS change or the environment in which the existing safety issue has  manifested.  Include the following information, when applicable:  

   A brief background on what triggered the need for a NAS change or the evaluation of an  existing safety issue.  If there is an associated SRM document, compliance issue, or  Top 5 issue that necessitated this NAS change, briefly summarize it here, and include  the associated reference or documentation as attachments.     The current hardware or software system or existing procedures/operations and the  corresponding (operational) system states.  

   The current procedure and its operational environment and, when applicable, a  discussion about elements of this issue that make it particularly unique or challenging.      Equipment or procedures needed to accommodate the implementation of the NAS  change.     Future configuration, system, or procedural changes that might affect the proposed  change/procedure or existing safety issue.  

# 1.4.1.4 Description of Change / Existing Safety Issue  

Provide a description of the proposed NAS change or the existing safety issue being addressed.     Include the following information, when applicable:  

   A description of the proposed NAS change/procedure or existing safety issue and any  critical safety parameters that are involved (e.g., prohibited/restricted airspace, noise  abatement area, and operational limitations).     When applicable, discuss the types of verifications that will be performed throughout the  development process to review whether the finalized proposed NAS change will be safe,  operational, and effective once implemented.  Evaluation can consist of simulator  modeling, live testing, or a combination thereof.     A depiction of the proposed NAS change/procedure or existing safety issue (if visual  illustration is beneficial).     Assumptions that make evaluating the NAS change or existing safety issue more  manageable or that better scope the change or issue undergoing SRM.     A summary of the relevant results of any related or preceding safety analyses (i.e., an  acquisition program or operational change).  Include any references and/or associated  documentation mentioned in  Section 1.4.1.10  of Annex A.     The traceability between the proposed change and the NAS Enterprise Architecture.  

#  

There may be cases in which, through performing elements of the SRM process (i.e., describing  the system / NAS change and identifying hazards), the SRM panel does not identify hazards  associated with the implementation of the NAS change, or the SRM panel determines that the  NAS change does not increase the current risk level.  In such cases, include a detailed rationale  that explains how the SRM panel came to that conclusion.  When the provisions of this section  apply, the SRM document is nearly complete.  Follow the guidance for Dissention (when  applicable), SRM Panel Attendees, and Appendices, and prepare the SRM document for  signatures.  

# 1.4.1.6 Hazard Identification and Risk Determination (If Hazards Are Identified)  

Provide a detailed explanation of each hazard identified.  Provide the completed HAW for each  hazard (see  Section 1.3.2.1  of Annex A for instructions on creating a HAW) and the information  necessary to support the risk overview in the Executive Summary.  

# 1.4.1.7 Monitoring Plan (If Hazards Are Identified)  

Complete a monitoring plan for each hazard identified (see  Section 1.3.2.2  of Annex A for  instructions on creating a monitoring plan).  Provide the completed monitoring plan table for  each hazard and the information necessary to support the monitoring overview in the Executive  Summary.  

# 1.4.1.8 Dissention (When Applicable)  

The SRM panel process strives for agreement by all panel members with official findings, such  as risk ratings.  If any SRM panel member disagrees with the SRM panel’s official findings, that  panel member should provide the nature and summary of the disagreement for inclusion in this  part of the SRM document.  SRM panel member discussions and disagreements that take place  while working toward consensus are not dissentions if the SRM panel member ultimately agrees  with or can live with the panel’s official findings, but such proceedings should be detailed in the  body of the SRM document.  

If an SME disagrees with the SRM panel’s official findings, and submits, in writing, an opposing  opinion, this opposing opinion is not included in the dissention section of the SRM  document.  However, the opinion should be attached to the SRM document as part of the  distribution.  

# 1.4.1.9 SRM Panel Attendees  

Include a table with each SRM panel attendees’ name and relevant information including their  position, facility, and FAA routing code.  Clarify each attendees’ role (i.e., facilitation team  member, change proponent, SRM panel member, SME, or SRM panel observer).  

# 1.4.1.10 Appendices  

Use appendices to include the following, as appropriate:  

   Supporting documentation, such as simulations, modeling, and other technical analyses;     Relevant references; and     Acronyms, terms, and definitions.  

# 1.4.2 SMTS  

SMTS is the official repository for all completed ATO SRM documents.   The change proponent  is responsible for ensuring that the SRM document is entered into SMTS before the initiation of  monitoring activities, the full implementation of the NAS change, or the achievement of an FAA  Acquisition Management System decision point.  The change proponent may record the  information directly, designate a responsible individual, or work with the SRM panel facilitator or  organization responsible for accepting safety risk to enter the SRM document into SMTS.    See  the Safety Risk Management Guidance for System Acquisitions for a more detailed description  of mandatory entry requirements for acquisition programs.  

# 1.4.2.1 Implementation Dates in SMTS  

Once the SRM document has been completed and all required signatures have been obtained,  the change proponent is responsible for providing a monitoring start date (i.e., the date after all  safety requirements are implemented).  This date must be entered into SMTS to trigger the  automated email notification process for the monitoring plan.  

# 2. Special SRM Considerations for Waiver Renewals and Approvals  

# 2.1 Overview  

The section provides guidance for SRM considerations specific to waiver renewals and  approvals.  

2.2 Documentation, Review, and Approval Process for Waivers to Separation Minima  A waiver to separation minima can result in aircraft being allowed closer than approved  separation from terrain, obstacles on the surface of the earth, airspace, or other aircraft.  The  current ATO Safety Guidance (ATO-SG) on separation minima lists the requirements in  FAA  Order JO 7110.65,  Air Traffic Control , that pertain to separation minima.  The ATO-SG also  details which NAS changes related to separation minima requirements need approval from  AOV.  

Any new waiver request or waiver renewal request that pertains to separation minima requires a  new SRM document or an SRM document on file that is developed in accordance with the ATO  SMS Manual.  The SRM document should include a quantitative analysis (e.g., scientific study,  Flight Standards Service report, detailed modeling, or Monte Carlo simulation) to support the  information provided.  

# 2.2.1 Initiate the Request for a New Waiver or Waiver Renewal  

Waivers must be kept to a minimum as they contribute to a nonstandard NAS.  Before  developing or renewing a waiver, coordinate with the appropriate Service Area and Service Unit  to obtain their commitment to the effort.    The Service Unit will coordinate with AJI to determine  whether additional information is warranted to support the request and SRM document.  

# 2.2.2 Waiver Development Guidance: Identify Appropriate Hazards  

Most paragraphs in FAA and ATO orders mitigate a potential safety hazard.    Attempt to identify  the hazard that the relevant order intends to mitigate to determine the appropriate hazard(s) to  address in the SRM document.  If the waiver request is intended to reduce safety risk, then  ensure there is sufficient justification in the SRM document, and show the waived procedures as  a means to reduce risk in the HAW.  

# 2.2.3 Relationship between the Waiver Request and the SRM Document  

All of the following waiver requirements should be covered in the SRM document:  

   The “Affected Directive” and “Operations Authorized” sections of the waiver should  match the “Description of Change” section of the SRM document.     The “Special Provisions, Conditions, and Limitations” section of the waiver should flow  out of the HAW section of the SRM document, specifically from the controls, system  states, and/or the safety requirements.     Remember to include any new safety requirements in the SRM document.  

# 2.2.4 Waiver Renewals  

Waivers must be renewed every two years.  When submitting a waiver renewal request, read  the current SRM document to determine whether any updates are necessary.  Keep in mind that  an SRM document must be updated to reflect the current operational environment.  All required  means to reduce risk (including the publication of information and any refresher training  requirements, as delineated in the original SRM document) must be in place.  

For each waiver renewal request:  

   Determine whether the level of safety risk that was introduced with the initial waiver  remains acceptable,  

   Use the safety performance monitoring results per the monitoring plan to allow the  responsible organization to determine whether the waiver is working as intended, and      Determine whether the provisions of the waiver have matured sufficiently that they  should be made available to all others in the NAS through inclusion in  FAA Order JO  7110.65 .  

Before submitting a waiver renewal request, ensure the monitoring information pertaining to the  existing waiver is up to date in SMTS.  All proposed modifications to any provision of the current  waiver will require a new waiver to be developed with a new SRM document.  

# 2.2.5 Waiver Approval  

All new waivers and waiver renewal requests will be approved by AJI.  AJI will coordinate the  approved waiver with AOV, if necessary.  Ensure that new waivers and information pertaining to  waiver renewals are entered in SMTS.
