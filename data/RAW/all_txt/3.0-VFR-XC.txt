Practical Risk Management for VFR XC Flying  

# URPOSE  

For many pilots, using an airplane for person- al transportation is one of the biggest benefits of being able to fly. However, since flight

training and flight reviews tend to fo- cus on basic skills and maneuvers, pilots do not always get opportunities to train for real-world cross-country flying. This guide offers ideas for teaching pilots to recognize and manage risk in VFR cross- country flying.  

# PROFILE  

VFR cross-country accidents often in- volve poor planning, decision-making, and risk management in areas such as:  

·Flight planning and monitoring  

·lnterpretation and application of weather briefing information  

·Fuel and performance management  

·ATc communication procedures  

·Basic airplanecontrol  

·Operating rules and procedures  

·Preflight inspection  

# PRACTICES  

Teachcross-country riskmanagement by structuring the flight review or a tran- sition training session as a VFR cross- country trip to an unfamilar airport.  

SampleScenarios  

1. Use the outbound leg to create the kind of dynamic flight environment thatapilot could encounter inthe real world.  

·lf terrain and route of flight permit simulate an engine problem (partial power or total failure).  

·Simulate the hazard of an inoperative VOR beacon or GPS receiver. "Failing a GPS receiver or VOR beacon provides a lesson on situational awareness.  

2. Have the pilot practice high perfor mance takeoffs and landings (including go-arounds) at an unfamiliar airport.  

3. Use the return leg to cover maneuvers normally performed for a flight review (e.g., slow flight, steep turns, stalls):  

·.Transitioning from slow flight into a power-off stall provides a more real- istic demonstration of how uninten- tional stalls can actually occur.  

·Have the pilot fly part of the trip by reference to instruments.  

Be alertfor the"teachable moments"on identifying hazards and managing risk throughout the flight:  

ilot — distraction of unfamiliar place A ircraft —- effect of density altitude  V ironment — landing illusions 人 xternal —requests from ATC  

# POSTFLIGHT  

Ask the pilot to verbally replay the the flight and reflect on these questions:  

·What went well?

·What could have been better?  

differently if I encounter similar con- ditions in a future flight? ·What are the three most important things I learned from this flight? ·What is the most critical knowledge gap I need to fill? ·What is the skill that I most need to practice and improve?
